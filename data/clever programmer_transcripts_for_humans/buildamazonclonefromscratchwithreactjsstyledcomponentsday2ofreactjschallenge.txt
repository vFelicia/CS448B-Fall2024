12:54 - also now you want to share uh now you
12:56 - want to give me a live share
12:58 - all right now i'm going to give you the

13:07 - thinking
13:08 - no i did not really know that's the one
13:10 - right here i'm showing you right there
13:11 - this one
13:13 - are you sure the project i'm sharing
13:15 - with you
13:16 - yeah this is the one david oh yeah this
13:19 - this is the one
13:20 - what are you talking about there all
13:21 - right david david what's wrong david so
13:23 - guys a few things that we need to do so
13:25 - let's go ahead and remove
13:26 - this deal let's remove this what i want
13:28 - you to do is i'll move this header right
13:29 - here we don't need that okay
13:31 - we need that you need the header and
13:33 - instead what i want you guys to focus on
13:35 - isn't it
13:36 - is a few things you see when you build a
13:39 - react.js project
13:40 - you build the right chest project it is
13:42 - very very simple right
13:44 - you want to think about how are we going
13:45 - to divide this project up right because
13:47 - when you think about um what's it called
13:50 - when you think about react js or
13:52 - anything or any any sort of project that
13:54 - you're building
13:55 - okay i'm going to split it up into a few
13:56 - parts okay and so what we're going to do
13:58 - right now is we're going to split up the
14:00 - components we'd like to call it all
14:01 - right
14:02 - so components are what components are
14:05 - building blocks is what i like to say so
14:07 - i'm going to say right there are
14:08 - building blocks and for example this
14:09 - header right here
14:10 - is a building block you see that right
14:12 - there that's a building block okay
14:14 - and then everything underneath the
14:15 - header is a building block right think
14:17 - of it as a block again anything that's a
14:19 - block
14:20 - it's a building block okay then what you
14:22 - got what do you have
14:24 - then you have this banner right here
14:25 - that's also a building block
14:27 - okay and then you have these small
14:29 - things right here
14:31 - and these are building blocks as well
14:33 - you see right there
14:34 - right there right there and right there
14:37 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
14:40 - going to think about a few different
14:42 - things that you know we need to work on
14:44 - in terms of to create this right
14:47 - remember
14:48 - big idea divide into small ideas okay
14:52 - so what's going to happen what's going
14:53 - to happen
14:55 - somebody says that can you make the font
14:57 - a little bigger you got it you got it i
14:58 - can make the phone a little bigger right
14:59 - here for you
15:00 - is that better i think it's better right
15:02 - i think it's better for you guys yeah
15:03 - yeah yeah i think so here we go that's
15:04 - better
15:05 - awesome so if what what i just said
15:07 - these are the guys the header so the
15:09 - first thing i'm going to do is i'm going
15:10 - to create a
15:11 - header component right that's going to
15:12 - be the part one that's for the part one
15:14 - that we're going to build so let's go
15:16 - ahead and
15:16 - look at this page you see if i refresh
15:18 - this page right if i go ahead and save
15:20 - this page and refresh this
15:21 - now it's a blank page don't worry don't
15:23 - panic it's all good
15:24 - all right no bueno all good so what i
15:27 - want to do instead is i'm going to
15:28 - create a header component because that's
15:29 - one of the building blocks that i just
15:31 - talked about right
15:33 - so this header component so what we're
15:34 - going to do is i'm going to source
15:36 - i'm going to say new file and we'll say
15:38 - header.js header.js
15:40 - right here dot gs go right there and
15:43 - that's going to be your component none
15:45 - again it's a javascript file
15:46 - but that's it it's going to contain
15:48 - everything so right as you can see
15:50 - david's already typing what he what
15:52 - david just typed i'm going to remove
15:53 - this for a second
15:54 - what david just typed is he typed in
15:55 - rfce
15:57 - oh david let me just type it hold on
15:58 - david
16:01 - rfce okay
16:04 - my bad so rscv is a shortcut
16:08 - guys when i do this it creates the
16:10 - header component right there
16:11 - and so now if i say header on here okay
16:14 - say header here and here nothing really
16:17 - shows up
16:18 - as you can see correct but but
16:21 - what do i need to do div in that in that
16:24 - case now tell me
16:24 - what do you think you need to import it
16:26 - to your application because right now
16:28 - it's just a component
16:30 - exactly so let's go ahead and import it
16:32 - i'm going to go app.js
16:34 - i will import it so what's going to
16:35 - happen is i will do it like this
16:37 - and i'll do import import guys header
16:41 - i'm going to say dot slash header right
16:44 - there
16:45 - import header header from
16:50 - from header like this like so you guys
16:52 - can see that right there beautiful right
16:54 - so it's going to import now when i say
16:56 - import header from
16:57 - it's going to import this component from
17:00 - where
17:01 - from here which is actually just right
17:04 - here just so you guys know okay just
17:06 - basically from there beautiful
17:08 - and so now what's gonna happen is that
17:10 - dave is gonna type in header as you can
17:11 - see right there
17:12 - you just type in header right there in
17:14 - header box and this is a component it's
17:17 - like a div tag
17:18 - guys right right think of it as a deal
17:20 - tag
17:21 - but it is a component and so now if i go
17:23 - ahead and save this
17:24 - i go back to here and boom right there
17:27 - you have
17:28 - the header let's go that is beautiful
17:30 - okay
17:31 - that is it right there let me go see
17:33 - what you guys are saying
17:35 - whoo let's go let's go import the jsx
17:37 - verbena what's up what's up everyone
17:39 - they're beautiful beautiful beautiful
17:41 - beautiful
17:42 - oh beautiful good night everybody love
17:45 - your content thank you so much i
17:46 - appreciate you
17:48 - thank you so much awesome so we got the
17:50 - header component now
17:51 - one thing i'm going to do is go and make
17:52 - some cleanup so i'll go to app.css i
17:55 - like to remove all this stuff we don't
17:56 - need this right here
17:58 - right then i'm going to remove all this
18:00 - stuff right here don't need this and
18:01 - what i like to add is i like to do
18:02 - margin zero
18:03 - so margins here so what is margin david
18:07 - tell me it's basically um
18:10 - so as you guys could see it everything
18:12 - was centered in the in the very center
18:15 - and we just removed all the all the
18:16 - styling now in terms of margin
18:19 - that's um little
18:24 - something on the very side and it's just
18:26 - a few
18:27 - uh pixels usually now it's going to be
18:29 - zeroed out so basically
18:31 - everything that you put into your
18:32 - application is going to be snapped to
18:34 - the side
18:35 - of your window beautiful exactly so it's
18:37 - not on the side of the window beautiful
18:38 - which is exactly what so now you can see
18:40 - here header now you see this right here
18:42 - it's now to the side of the window as
18:44 - you guys see right there all right
18:46 - beautiful
18:47 - so now because i had a js one thing i
18:49 - want to do is i want to create the css
18:50 - file but actually we're not going to use
18:51 - css for this we're going to use
18:52 - something called
18:54 - style components which is the really
18:56 - cool part okay
18:57 - don't worry about okay what we'll say so
18:59 - on the header
19:01 - what's going to happen if we think about
19:02 - this let's go and now divide up the
19:04 - header here's our amazon clone right
19:06 - there
19:06 - okay what do we have in header well we
19:08 - have a few things all right let's think
19:10 - about this and go rectangle
19:11 - so here's a header here's a header right
19:14 - here beautiful
19:15 - now how do we divide this very simple
19:18 - well we have the logo
19:19 - right we had the say hello address
19:22 - okay we have the search bar we have what
19:26 - we have the hello nazari account list
19:30 - and then what else do we have what else
19:32 - do we have tell me huh
19:34 - and then we also have the returns orders
19:36 - and then we have a card section
19:38 - right there you see guys so by having
19:40 - these specific components we now
19:41 - know what to create so let's think of
19:43 - this i'm going to keep this on here
19:44 - so let's go and do this um
19:48 - david let's create the first component
19:50 - which is the name should be let's go
19:52 - ahead and name
19:53 - the component uh what should we call
19:55 - this the
19:56 - component huh tell me let's do header
19:58 - logo component okay
19:59 - so let's create a component called
20:01 - header logo yes

25:30 - snipping hot tell me so basically
25:33 - this is uh these are two span tags
25:37 - with their specific class names and it's
25:40 - just
25:41 - uh it's just saying the word hello on
25:43 - the top
25:45 - and the one down below is saying select
25:47 - your address
25:48 - it's basically the the little piece if
25:51 - you go to amazon.com
25:53 - you will see the exact same stuff
25:55 - exactly so kind of like when you do
25:56 - hellos like your
25:57 - as you can see right and so we can do
25:59 - these are here guys
26:00 - oh and we have another donation let me
26:02 - see let me see let me see
26:04 - now donation hey let's go
26:07 - thank you so much just love the videos
26:09 - thank you so much akito appreciate it
26:11 - chf2 what is that i'm not really sure
26:12 - what that is oh uh
26:14 - that's that's swiss right yeah i'm not
26:17 - really sure that is
26:18 - but guys check this out so what's going
26:19 - to happen is this hello is a span tag
26:21 - and we're going to convert this into an
26:23 - actual style component
26:24 - so what we're going to do is this option
26:26 - line one
26:27 - i'm going to say here const option
26:31 - line one right line that far
26:35 - okay option line one yes i want to go
26:37 - that far equals
26:38 - style.div okay right there beautiful
26:42 - style.div and and then so forth i'm
26:45 - going to we're going to add a style in a
26:46 - second here and then we'll do
26:47 - const option what is it line two
26:53 - option line two right there is equal to
26:57 - also style that div
26:59 - style dot div right there
27:02 - that div okay so and that's also gonna
27:04 - be where we put the css and so forth so
27:07 - we can that
27:07 - we got these four components at this
27:09 - point right here and you can see david
27:11 - right here is create them into
27:12 - components so option line one option
27:14 - line
27:15 - two inside the header option address
27:18 - okay beautiful beautiful beautiful so
27:20 - what's gonna happen now at this point is
27:22 - we need to style them but
27:23 - let's see what we've got so far all
27:25 - right so it says style is not defined
27:28 - i think it's because they probably spell
27:30 - the wrong style
27:32 - style is not defined there we go style
27:35 - is not put it in past tense
27:36 - oh man grammar bro
27:40 - style come on save it okay ops and line
27:43 - watch so
27:44 - style's not defined let me go hey there
27:47 - we go beautiful
27:48 - beautiful right there so it says hello
27:49 - it's like your address now
27:51 - okay now the one thing you have to think
27:53 - about is you see this header
27:55 - logo this header logo is basically
27:59 - the logo now we definitely technically
28:00 - we should have put this height on the
28:01 - not the logo but technically we should
28:03 - put this on the
28:04 - on the actual container yeah there we go
28:06 - the header level right thank you so
28:07 - we'll do
28:08 - basically i just uh deleted the div from
28:11 - here
28:11 - yes yes yes yes and then i'm just going
28:14 - to go ahead and create a new
28:15 - style component so instead of doing div
28:17 - we do create a header
28:19 - the reason why is because this will
28:21 - allow us to add the css with style
28:23 - components all right
28:24 - beautiful so let's go ahead and add that
28:26 - there i can just paste it in here where
28:28 - i have it
28:29 - right there beautiful right there you go
28:30 - ahead awesome sweet sweet so it's going
28:32 - to save this
28:33 - all right and what do we have so far it
28:35 - says does some error it's okay if you
28:37 - refresh this no problem
28:39 - const header style dot do
28:42 - oh we can't we have to do we have to
28:44 - make a container bro
28:46 - container like this you cannot just call
28:48 - it like that
28:49 - there you go oh really because the class
28:52 - name is the header that's why
28:56 - there we go see look at that i know you
28:59 - can't see anything on here right it says
29:00 - hello select your eyes that's the only
29:01 - thing you can see but that's pretty much
29:02 - it so
29:03 - next thing i want to do is after the
29:05 - option solid address let's go and
29:07 - actually add the logo in here okay
29:09 - and the logo is what is just an image
29:11 - source so i'm gonna do image here
29:13 - so let me go and do this part now so
29:15 - we'll do image
29:17 - image right here image source is equal
29:20 - to something
29:21 - don't worry about that just yet okay and
29:23 - we're gonna
29:24 - close it out now right there now
29:27 - the image source is i mean it's an image
29:29 - right so
29:30 - the image that we have here is actually
29:32 - right there let me go ahead and get this
29:34 - image for you i'm going to give it
29:36 - i have this image logo which is actually
29:38 - here i will put this for you guys in the
29:40 - comments so you guys can have it okay
29:42 - beautiful this is the image you see
29:43 - there's the amazon logo image so
29:45 - let's go ahead and do that i'm gonna
29:46 - paste it into here i'm gonna make it as
29:48 - a string
29:49 - boom right there and done so save that
29:52 - all right amazing oh
29:54 - let's go david if you can go ahead and
29:57 - copy that image url this imagery
30:00 - the people that's already in the
30:01 - comments guys you're the best bro
30:03 - you're the best you're the best awesome
30:06 - we're gonna put it to facebook
30:08 - yeah well that's that's that's in a
30:09 - second here so so now
30:11 - let's think about this okay we have this
30:12 - logo here right
30:14 - and then what else do we have well we
30:16 - have the logo here and now we have the
30:18 - hello select your edges
30:19 - we now need to put them side by side
30:23 - okay now how do we do that right because
30:26 - we look when we look at this right
30:27 - i mean this is side by side correct side
30:30 - by side right
30:31 - so what we do is we use something called
30:33 - display
30:34 - flex all right display flex so what's
30:37 - going to happen is
30:38 - i'm going to go the container and i will
30:40 - say display
30:42 - display flex on
30:45 - the container so save that
30:48 - okay uh let's see what happens now okay
30:51 - so nothing happens at this point okay
30:54 - right
30:54 - now we're going to do is what what he's
30:56 - doing what david is doing is doing a
30:58 - line item
30:58 - center to center everything vertically
31:01 - and if i go ahead and save this to make
31:02 - sure
31:03 - and then he's going to just justify
31:04 - content center don't worry about that
31:05 - don't worry don't worry about the
31:06 - justification just yet okay
31:08 - just do a lineup center for now so you
31:10 - can see the amazon clone is not a line
31:12 - center but it's still horrible guys
31:13 - right
31:14 - why is that akito says my last
31:18 - credit for you guys thank you so much i
31:20 - appreciate you let's go
31:22 - beautiful beautiful beautiful thank you

31:25 - epic i love you guys uh love so much
31:28 - love for everybody
31:29 - that's always good to hear all right
31:30 - perfect so we got that portion
31:32 - um now let's go focus on the image
31:35 - itself so if we have this header logo
31:37 - right let's focus on the image let's do
31:39 - image
31:40 - we'll do image and on the image what i
31:43 - want to do
31:44 - is well technically a few things i'm
31:46 - going to give it a width of 100
31:48 - 100 pixels what 100 pixels
31:52 - right there there and then what i'm
31:54 - going to do is i'm going to give it what
31:57 - well nothing because look if i give it a
32:00 - width of 100 pixels that's it look at
32:01 - this guys this is done you see this
32:03 - right here
32:03 - the amazon logo only has a 100 pixels
32:06 - the height will change automatically
32:08 - and so it's no longer a hideous amazon
32:10 - logo that's over
32:11 - on everything that we don't need you
32:12 - know what i mean but
32:14 - boom it's all done right there one thing
32:17 - i'm gonna do is i'm gonna give some
32:18 - margin to us i'm gonna say margin left
32:20 - margin left 11 pixels
32:24 - right there so save that module i like
32:26 - pixels and so that get adds some space
32:28 - so now just so you know guys
32:29 - so you guys know what is margin well
32:31 - margin is very simple right if i go
32:33 - ahead and do this right here
32:35 - if this is the container right the
32:37 - margin
32:39 - is a space right there is a space right
32:42 - here
32:43 - boom right little space on the side it's
32:45 - a space
32:46 - you know on the side it's like almost
32:48 - like for example if you have
32:49 - i don't know let's just have a piece of
32:51 - paper let's just say this right you guys
32:53 - got a piece of paper okay
32:54 - the margin is this space okay it's the
32:57 - space right there
32:58 - same thing here it's a space here right
33:00 - it's a space here
33:01 - the patty on the other hand that's a
33:02 - space inside that's so called padding
33:04 - guys just so you know all right
33:05 - beautiful so i know that's some

33:14 - we've got the amazon logo that's great

33:19 - is
33:20 - next david huh what do you think uh so
33:24 - next

33:30 - see what the text is
33:32 - let's see it let's see it color white
33:35 - nice i think it's a i think it's a good

33:52 - component how about that okay that's
33:54 - fine that's fine that's fine so
33:55 - okay so let's continue laying out the
33:57 - structure so we have the header option
33:58 - address right here

36:44 - simple things so we got the input
36:46 - what's the next one after that one going
36:48 - to be which is the hello account as ours
36:49 - list what can we do for that one
36:51 - david huh tell me uh before we do that
36:54 - we will need to add another thing it's
36:57 - going to be just an icon
36:59 - okay which icon it's a part of the
37:02 - header search
37:03 - okay let's do that right now header whoa
37:09 - we are at 452 likes you guys are
37:12 - the best that's all i can say to you
37:17 - beautiful all right sweet sweet sweet so
37:19 - had a search container right there
37:21 - and so the icon that he's working on is
37:23 - very simple he's working on this icon
37:26 - right here header search icon container
37:28 - right so
37:29 - it's going to be orange and then it's
37:31 - going to have an icon inside so
37:32 - now let's think about though the big
37:34 - question is how do we get this icon how
37:36 - do we get this icon david huh
37:38 - all right for that we should be using
37:40 - material ui
37:41 - yes yes so check this out guys
37:45 - we use material ui icons material ui
37:49 - icons right there beautiful sweet sweet
37:51 - sweet it's
37:52 - basically a completely free icon set
37:55 - provided by google
37:56 - open source i'm not sure if it's open
37:58 - source but you can use it you can use
38:00 - the problem so it's open source
38:01 - so i can click search for example i can
38:03 - type in search and hopefully it gives me
38:05 - search
38:06 - come on all right doesn't like doesn't
38:08 - want to give me a search
38:10 - unless google is broken or something
38:13 - there you go you see so i got the search
38:14 - these are all the search icons i have in
38:16 - front of me here
38:17 - and so i click on by the way it tells me
38:20 - how do we go ahead and get it so i'm
38:21 - going to go ahead and copy this right
38:23 - here
38:24 - boom i'm going to import it on my side
38:27 - of the code
38:28 - okay good so we just copied that icon
38:31 - okay
38:32 - now of course we still don't have access
38:34 - to this guys
38:35 - because why we need to also now install
38:38 - it so you can see david here what's he
38:39 - doing here
38:40 - well he's installing it right there
38:43 - right there you see that right there
38:44 - he's installing npm user ui install
38:48 - npm material ui core and also install
38:52 - material ui icons right so two things
38:56 - two things guys two things thus let's
38:59 - see what we do let's see how this works
39:02 - good good good good good good good so we
39:04 - got that
39:05 - all right we got this let's install the
39:07 - immature ui core
39:08 - guys make sure to pay attention for the
39:11 - order first you have to install the core
39:14 - then you can install the icons
39:16 - okay because the icon is built on top of
39:18 - the core good awesome
39:20 - all right so that's perfect we've got
39:21 - that specific portion
39:23 - so now if we're going to use this you
39:25 - see now we can actually use the search
39:26 - icon
39:26 - and to use it all i gotta do is just
39:28 - type it in like this it's just like a
39:29 - component right there
39:30 - you see yeah it's actually a component
39:33 - david you're so fast at this i just
39:34 - don't understand what it did
39:38 - all right one thing we're saying here is
39:40 - a header search container is not defined
39:41 - the reason why is because we need to go
39:42 - ahead and create the component so i will
39:44 - say
39:44 - const i see a num faster than david
39:47 - header
39:48 - header search
39:49 - [Laughter]
39:52 - search container this one okay container
39:55 - right there is equal to what styled
39:59 - dots
40:02 - there we go gotta save that let's go
40:06 - it still says not defined probably
40:07 - because i've misspelled it header
40:10 - search container let me see here's a
40:13 - container right there
40:14 - uh come on come on do us do with me
40:16 - there we go
40:18 - icon container that's the one now so
40:20 - check this out
40:21 - you can see this you see how this icon
40:23 - is right here again we can fix that by
40:25 - using what
40:26 - something called display flex okay
40:29 - so header search is right here and so
40:32 - what we will do is we'll go to header
40:33 - search which is where is it
40:35 - right there we'll see display flex on
40:37 - this one
40:39 - good save that and boom right there you
40:42 - got yourself that thing that you wanted
40:43 - the whole time okay it's as easy as that
40:46 - guys all right
40:47 - after that guys what's gonna happen is
40:49 - we've got the logo
40:50 - let's go and continue on and continue
40:52 - building that structure okay what's next
40:54 - exactly so next up we got the header
40:56 - knob items
40:58 - good and those are gonna be like
41:00 - everything else
41:01 - on the right hand side so if you can uh
41:03 - take a look if you can show us the
41:05 - finished product yes right there um
41:08 - it's going to be everything from hello
41:10 - nazari
41:11 - account list something that returns and
41:14 - orders
41:15 - and even the card icon with the number
41:18 - okay right there returns orders and the
41:19 - card icon right there
41:20 - beautiful yes yes yes yes yes yes cool
41:24 - all right um so for that uh we're gonna
41:26 - be just creating a brand new
41:28 - um style.div which is gonna be header
41:33 - um nav items never items yep
41:38 - that's another style component and this
41:39 - is going to contain what this one's
41:41 - going to contain
41:42 - all these things things okay
41:45 - so we're going to have the header option
41:48 - one that's the one well you can use the
41:50 - same one option line one option line two
41:52 - right
41:53 - no no that's going to be inside of this
41:55 - one because we have the hello and azari
41:59 - it should be the same should the same
42:09 - okay fine fine fine david fine fine fine
42:12 - fine
42:14 - then you have option line one option
42:16 - line two exactly got it
42:18 - okay okay all right so again what's
42:19 - going on here guys right so we have the
42:21 - header nav item so just so you know okay
42:22 - we have the header nav items right here
42:24 - okay
42:27 - basically they had enough items and then
42:29 - the way we're going to connect this
42:30 - is this portion the hello account azaris
42:33 - that could be header option
42:35 - and then this is also going to be a
42:36 - header option right here
42:38 - right there right there you see we have
42:40 - option line one that's gonna be hello
42:42 - account azaris which is going to be here
42:44 - so if we go ahead and check this out
42:45 - let's go ahead and do hello
42:48 - hola so hello comma
42:52 - comma good good go sorry and then
42:56 - the last one's gonna be what
42:59 - hello account and list good and finally
43:02 - the last time from here is going to be
43:04 - returns
43:04 - so let's go and type in returns guys
43:07 - returns
43:08 - good good right there right there good
43:11 - right there so you can see what we just
43:12 - did right we create these components
43:14 - header option
43:15 - header option right both of both of
43:17 - these are header options right here okay
43:20 - that's gonna be the header nav items and
43:22 - i think the last one that we have to
43:23 - that one is gonna be the header option
43:25 - cart okay that is correct yes yes
43:29 - so let me go ahead and actually type
43:30 - that one out let me type that one out
43:32 - option yeah i'll do that sorry yeah it's
43:34 - faster okay
43:35 - oh i see how it is okay you can take it
43:37 - over from here
43:38 - you can take it so header option card
43:40 - there's a few things that i had an
43:41 - option card which is
43:42 - going to be guys this one right there
43:44 - okay just so you know header
43:45 - option card now for the header option
43:48 - card a few things need to create
43:49 - number one the card itself number two
43:52 - is the number correct so let's try that
43:55 - so the first one is going to be the card
43:57 - i'm going to go to the material icons
43:59 - let's go and start searching cart
44:02 - cart let's see right there this is a
44:05 - good one you see the shopping basket i
44:06 - kind of like that one it's going to copy
44:08 - this one
44:09 - go to copy the shopping basket go back
44:11 - to our thing
44:12 - it's going to import it here voila
44:15 - boom that gives us that that's awesome
44:18 - good good good good good and so now if
44:21 - you look at our thing
44:22 - holy shmack money
44:26 - guacamole holy guacamole so many things
44:29 - that we have do
44:30 - are not defined guys okay so many things
44:32 - but again
44:33 - it is completely completely okay hey
44:37 - all right superb guys good good good
44:39 - good good good good
44:41 - so so the first thing to do is go ahead
44:43 - let's go ahead and all these things said
44:44 - undefined
44:45 - let's create them so you can see he's
44:48 - already on it so we have header
44:49 - option which is not defined next we're
44:51 - going to create is the header nav
44:53 - items right there good oh yeah
44:58 - good good good that's going to create
45:00 - the hand items david
45:03 - yes so constant high enough items
45:07 - nice and then the header option cart
45:10 - right there okay
45:12 - we got that already got that all right
45:13 - so we've created these styles of this
45:15 - and they're empty i mean they're not i
45:16 - mean they
45:17 - they and so we have a low account list
45:19 - and returns and notice
45:20 - now again horrible horrible thing right
45:24 - how do we go ahead and now put these to
45:27 - be alongside
45:28 - well we use the display flags to put
45:30 - them outside so just remember just
45:31 - memorize that if you want something side
45:34 - by side
45:35 - then flex side it does that make sense
45:37 - flex excited
45:37 - [Laughter]
45:40 - you just came up with this right yeah
45:42 - the display flex it how about that
45:45 - oh yeah exactly so display flex save
45:48 - that you just
45:49 - save it you just need to save it let's
45:51 - go
45:52 - there we go beautiful all right for the
45:54 - i had an option card let's go and
45:56 - actually use this shopping bask icon
45:57 - shopping shopping basket icon
46:01 - i will place that into here right there
46:10 - okay so we got the basket icon right
46:12 - there and now let's go ahead
46:13 - and get the the actual card count so i'm
46:16 - going to create a new component called
46:17 - card account
46:19 - card count right there boom
46:22 - that's like this boom card count and
46:24 - let's say for now i'm going to put a
46:26 - placeholder that's going to say for
46:27 - example five
46:28 - four for just just four for now so let's
46:31 - go down to here
46:32 - let's go to const
46:35 - const cart count is
46:38 - equal to style.diff right
46:44 - [Music]
46:46 - oh come on it's right there you guys
46:49 - okay good good good
46:52 - sometimes i know i know i know so now
46:55 - a lot of things have happened here at
46:56 - this point you can see we've got the
46:59 - pretty much the fundamental of this
47:01 - header okay now
47:02 - one thing to do is let's go and style
47:05 - this hello nazari and accounts
47:06 - list right there to be more like the way
47:09 - it should be okay
47:10 - so let's check it out well for the uh
47:12 - the actual header option
47:13 - line one uh well line two this line two
47:17 - we need to actually make that
47:18 - into a font weight of 700 so let's go
47:21 - ahead and go to do
47:22 - option line two let's go ahead and do
47:24 - this font wait
47:27 - wait wait wait wait
47:31 - you like that that thing when you go to
47:32 - you press the button says wait
47:36 - not talking about no oh [ __ ] okay never
47:39 - mind
47:39 - [Laughter]
47:42 - all right so there you go you see now
47:44 - this right here is more has more weight
47:46 - on it so does this is more bold and so
47:47 - is this more bold now
47:48 - one thing i'll be asking okay so now is
47:50 - how do we go ahead and actually space
47:51 - this out spaces out properly well
47:53 - how do we space these things out
47:55 - properly well here's what we can do
47:58 - on the container you see those items
48:00 - align items guys just so you know
48:02 - that centers it vertically okay now
48:06 - justify content centers it horizontally
48:09 - but there's different methods to it if i
48:11 - go to
48:12 - flexbox flexbox for example
48:16 - okay xbox oh damn david just already
48:19 - gave it the answer
48:20 - holy moly ah it's nothing okay so
48:23 - flexbox you see
48:24 - this needs to be your friend your best
48:27 - friend
48:28 - in the world okay here's why because
48:31 - this is going to explain how flexbox
48:32 - works so you can see you have a
48:34 - container right there
48:35 - and these are the children these are the
48:37 - div items and
48:38 - we can number one we can put them in
48:40 - horizontal or vertical fashion if i
48:42 - wanted to
48:43 - or if i for example i want to wrap them
48:45 - and then look at this
48:46 - look at this check this out you see
48:48 - there's justified content
48:49 - i can space them out evenly i can space
48:52 - them out in between
48:53 - i can center them if i wanted to flex
48:55 - and like start pretty much
48:56 - anything i want
49:00 - understood good now this is the vertical
49:03 - alignment align
49:04 - items right there flex start flex end
49:06 - center
49:07 - stretch and so forth as you can see
49:09 - beautiful so we can use that now guys
49:11 - okay
49:12 - let's use that let's go ahead and go to
49:13 - here and we'll say justify content
49:16 - justify content content what
49:20 - space between space between
49:25 - basically what it's gonna do it's gonna
49:27 - make sure that the space
49:29 - between the children is equal exactly so
49:31 - if i go to amazon
49:33 - oh would you look at that
49:36 - okay would you look at that so
49:39 - exactly that's awesome right that is
49:41 - amazing so beautiful so now let's think
49:43 - about this
49:44 - okay now let's think about the um
49:51 - let me think about that i mean do it for
49:53 - uh
49:54 - nav items as well yeah i'll do it for
49:57 - nav items too
49:58 - so for the net but i mean i don't want
49:59 - like for me for these ones these ones we
50:01 - just need to add them proper padding for
50:02 - these ones
50:03 - so let's go now to the header
50:06 - where is it nav items now i love these
50:08 - ones so
50:09 - guys what do you guys think if we want
50:11 - to go ahead let me know
50:12 - in the comments below if i want to go
50:14 - ahead and add spacing right in between
50:16 - these specific things
50:18 - what do you think we need to do tell me
50:20 - what do you think is something we need
50:21 - to do huh you
50:22 - guys tell me put in the comments below
50:23 - okay i'm very curious what you know
50:25 - okay for what you learned so far well
50:28 - for these ones the header option kind of
50:31 - the header
50:32 - option well a few things we're gonna do
50:34 - padding for these ones okay
50:36 - let me go to header option right here
50:38 - right there again remember
50:40 - header option are these specific divs
50:42 - okay
50:44 - so for the header option let's do
50:45 - padding
50:47 - padding uh what should we do patterning
50:51 - left playing left nine pixels
50:55 - left nine pixels beautiful padding left
50:58 - nine pixels and then after that what's
50:59 - going to happen is what
51:01 - is that's gonna give it some padding lat
51:02 - nine pixels then we'll do
51:05 - padding uh putting right nine pixels
51:12 - heading right
51:15 - right nine pixels good good good good
51:18 - good good
51:19 - and then what's gonna happen padding top
51:25 - panning this top is gonna be which one
51:28 - good padding top is what
51:29 - 10 pixels good and then finally penny
51:32 - bottom
51:35 - bottom 10 pixels oh
51:38 - let's go oh not one pixel 10 pixels
51:42 - not even trouble huh come on
51:45 - i know hold on hold your horses man i
51:48 - know you want to do the trouble thing so
51:49 - check this out now guys
51:50 - you see how we just add a penny right
51:52 - there and let me see what you guys said
51:54 - because i think a lot of you guys have
51:55 - said the right answer let me see a lot
51:57 - of you guys said the right answer on the
51:58 - whole common stuff
52:00 - go let me see let me see learning so
52:02 - much for now thank you that's amazing
52:04 - i'm that's i'm pumped good padding
52:07 - somebody said could you do 10 pixels yes
52:09 - good cuttings that's a good one too
52:12 - that's a good one too i like that one
52:14 - so padding heading left tell you need
52:18 - space
52:20 - that's a funny one hold your horses
52:23 - hey sheila oh that's funny
52:27 - padding good good good guys good job
52:28 - good job so now let's think about this
52:30 - so we got that portion now we can
52:32 - convert this side guys
52:34 - to actually something shorter it's
52:36 - called trouble
52:38 - look at this i want you to pay attention
52:39 - to this really quickly okay i'm gonna
52:40 - increase the size of this even bigger
52:42 - now padding look at this padding
52:46 - and check this out i want you trouble
52:48 - top so i want you to memorize this
52:50 - specific word
52:51 - right so i'm gonna say trouble
52:56 - trouble right there okay now what does
52:58 - this mean is very simple
53:00 - ah [ __ ] hold on trouble
53:05 - right there okay all right so what does
53:09 - this mean it's very simple guys
53:11 - if you want to think about this so go
53:13 - ahead uh so add the amount of padding
53:15 - for this david go ahead and do it
53:16 - do it from there do it with me right
53:18 - there
53:19 - let's do it so 10 pixels so 10 this can
53:22 - be stand for top
53:24 - you see then this right here is going to
53:27 - stand for
53:28 - right that's the right side
53:31 - good this trouble then b it's going to
53:34 - stand for
53:34 - bottom good and then
53:38 - the last one this is going to be left
53:41 - that's going to say for our left right
53:44 - there
53:44 - so trouble top right bottom
53:47 - left right top right bottom left
53:51 - right and you can replace all of this
53:53 - just using this short hand really nicely
53:55 - guys you see that yes or no
53:57 - really really nice really good really
53:58 - cool right and so now i can
54:01 - remove all this stuff boom voila
54:05 - oh look at that guys cheeky picky
54:08 - and then we're all good huh yeah am i
54:11 - right
54:13 - oh 522 likes guys let's get to 600. can
54:17 - we get this 600 likes
54:19 - i'll know you guys can do it let's go
54:20 - let's go
54:23 - all right beautiful i did it can you go
54:26 - ahead and continue coding and what are
54:27 - we going to do work on next and actually
54:28 - that's going to work on this
54:29 - input this let's work on this specific
54:32 - import okay
54:33 - i like that this one you see the search
54:35 - box that's working down right now yes
54:38 - all right so the storage
54:42 - uh we will need to first fix how the uh
54:45 - header search as a div looks like right
54:50 - where are we at okay there we go good
54:52 - good good continue continue on
54:55 - okay here we go god now heather search
54:58 - we want to make sure that it
54:59 - uses as much space as it possibly gets
55:02 - some water
55:02 - can what's up
55:05 - i'm gonna get some water oh yeah okay so
55:08 - um so for the heather search we want to
55:12 - make sure that it uses
55:13 - all the space that it actually has so
55:15 - for that we will be saying flex dash
55:18 - grow mm-hmm meaning grow as much as
55:21 - possible okay think about it as like
55:23 - for example you know let's say like like
55:26 - let's say this is taking up space you
55:27 - see this thing that's taking on space
55:28 - right
55:29 - if i want to grow as much as possible i
55:30 - say flex grow one so it's gonna be as
55:31 - big as possible like
55:33 - this big you know what i mean that's
55:34 - gonna be flag scroll one
55:36 - okay all right exactly all right
55:40 - and um it's just gonna use like it's
55:43 - gonna stretch out all the way but it's
55:45 - only gonna be the container for now
55:47 - correct because the container guys you
55:48 - can see is this one right there
55:50 - that's the container right which is this
55:51 - so if you see it's stretching as much as
55:53 - i can
55:54 - and that's the container guys okay
55:56 - exactly
55:57 - good that's gonna continue on now for
56:00 - the
56:00 - we we obviously want to make sure that
56:02 - the actual input
56:04 - is going to do the exact same so let's
56:07 - see how it looks like
56:08 - up here so we got the uh header search
56:12 - input okay good good component
56:16 - and we want to make sure that that takes
56:18 - up as much space as it can
56:20 - as well so we will do flex grow
56:23 - one in there too and if i save it from
56:27 - here it might not go
56:28 - oops there we go okay so hopefully you
56:31 - guys can actually
56:32 - see that uh on the top top of the screen
56:35 - it actually shrinked all the way till
56:37 - the very end
56:38 - and now even the search box search
56:41 - uh input box is actually uh using all
56:45 - the space it can
56:47 - now next up um because we already have
56:50 - the display facts
56:52 - we just want to make sure that it is uh
56:55 - the right beautiful look at that you see
56:56 - that this input is
56:58 - fully growing right there beautiful and
57:00 - then that's awesome so that's gonna be
57:01 - flex curl one
57:02 - so again guys let's go one it's actually
57:04 - defined here inside
57:06 - inside flexbox as you can see let me see
57:09 - let me
57:09 - go back to here
57:13 - see if like shrink and then flex curl
57:15 - right there you see so for example this
57:17 - two is a flex girl one right here okay
57:19 - that's going to grow more than anything
57:21 - else that's what you guys need to
57:22 - understand all right
57:23 - good uh let's go ahead and continue on
57:26 - all right cool um so what we will do
57:29 - next up is we want to make sure
57:31 - that the uh the
57:34 - uh container
57:38 - is 40 pixels high so we're just gonna
57:40 - say height
57:42 - of 40 pixels um
57:45 - let me save it nice beautiful okay
57:49 - that's much better much better right
57:52 - yeah so much better
57:53 - and uh we want to give it a border
57:55 - radius of four pixels
57:56 - so it's just going to um make a
58:00 - circular and a border radius guys that's
58:02 - sharp in your border is it can you see
58:04 - if i go ahead and zoom in on here
58:05 - you see how so sharp it's like it's like
58:07 - edgy i don't like it right so
58:09 - a border base is gonna make it basically
58:11 - smooth
58:12 - it's gonna be smooth so let's go ahead
58:14 - and do this
58:15 - what so look at that
58:19 - it's still not fully smooth for a
58:20 - certain so for the suga let's go ahead
58:22 - and do for the border
58:23 - because that's because i forgot to put
58:25 - the pigs there but now it should be
58:27 - smooth
58:28 - now it's still not going to be smooth
58:29 - actually yeah no it's not
58:31 - there's there's a reason why but don't
58:32 - worry about that we'll talk about that
58:33 - in a second here why
58:34 - it's not smooth but i want you to what i
58:36 - want us to work on actually now david
58:38 - is let's work on this search box you see
58:40 - this search container
58:41 - so header search icon container
58:44 - because down has a very very special
58:46 - styling for that one all right so let's
58:48 - work on that one right now where did i
58:49 - lose it
58:51 - there we go i lost it here ah come on
58:55 - good so and for this one it's going to
58:57 - be very simple

62:56 - rocking you so a few things i want you
63:00 - guys now to do let's go ahead and
63:01 - continue on okay we're not done yet and
63:03 - we're not done anywhere
63:04 - we're not close to it yet so you see
63:06 - look now let's take a look at this
63:07 - border
63:08 - radius remember how did this border
63:09 - radius here and the header search right
63:11 - there
63:12 - well check this out the reason why the
63:14 - border race is not
63:15 - fully there is a following reason if i
63:17 - right click and spec dump on this one
63:18 - let's go and take a look at this where
63:21 - is it where's our header search well
63:23 - it's pretty much
63:24 - here this is the header search and if we
63:25 - go and take a look at the css applied to
63:27 - it
63:28 - border radius okay you see that right
63:30 - there it's border with four pixels right
63:31 - there that's the one okay beautiful
63:33 - it's not applied because of overflow
63:35 - look at this if i do overflow
63:38 - hidden oh uh-huh
63:42 - yeah yeah that's what i thought exactly
63:48 - boom you can see that right there this
63:50 - is a much
63:51 - better now circular you see it actually
63:53 - has a nice concave shape to it now
63:55 - that's exactly what we want okay so we
63:57 - got that portion that's just good
63:59 - let's finish up with that with this
64:01 - input box which
64:02 - look which needs a little bit of fixing
64:04 - which what are some things that you need
64:06 - to
64:06 - need to tell me david so definitely a
64:09 - fix that we
64:10 - we we can't just miss and it just bugs
64:13 - my eyes for
64:14 - the last i don't know how many minutes
64:16 - that we have that
64:17 - go ahead but what i definitely want to
64:19 - do is
64:20 - making sure that it doesn't light up in
64:23 - the glue
64:24 - when you click inside right okay go
64:27 - ahead
64:28 - so what i want to do is i want to type
64:30 - in focus
64:31 - uh with a column okay so basically on
64:33 - the focus of this input
64:35 - so when i say focus it means when i
64:36 - click on this you see when i click on
64:38 - this
64:38 - right there see how there's this blue
64:40 - hideous box
64:41 - the way we know that it has blues is
64:43 - hideous box because if i do focus on
64:45 - this and if i do for example
64:46 - if i right click on this and i do four
64:48 - state focus you can see right there
64:50 - and i go to here you can see this is
64:53 - there's this
64:54 - hideous outline right there you see this
64:57 - in the
64:57 - right there where is it where is it
64:59 - where is it right there in the before
65:00 - state again
65:01 - put four state it's a hideous outline
65:04 - that's this
65:05 - it's just so ugh look at this horrible
65:08 - right
65:08 - so what we do is we say focus outline
65:11 - none which will remove that portion
65:13 - and so now when i go ahead and refresh
65:15 - this since i save this here
65:18 - boom beautiful it's exactly what i want
65:22 - so much better so so much better okay
65:25 - next up
65:26 - next i want to do is let's go ahead and
65:27 - do the following thing which is
65:29 - got the flex girl one that's awesome
65:31 - what is this
65:32 - weird trickery going on here do you see
65:35 - what i mean
65:36 - with this you know there's like space in
65:38 - between the the header
65:40 - search container and everything like
65:41 - that do you see that right there
65:43 - it's weird right here you see this right
65:44 - here
65:47 - there's like something going on i'm not
65:49 - sure what it is but it's something going
65:50 - on it's
65:50 - really odd i'm not sure what it is
65:52 - exactly exactly sure what you're
65:55 - showing but let me see probably there
65:59 - oh yeah that way let's see input let me
66:02 - see
66:02 - margin zero that's fine
66:06 - let's girl one which is fine that's all
66:08 - good i like that
66:10 - okay so maybe you don't need to focus
66:11 - too much on it because i don't want to
66:12 - focus too much on it on this specific
66:14 - portion instead i want to focus on the
66:15 - other stuff
66:16 - which is i want to go ahead and focus
66:18 - away because there's this div right here
66:20 - too
66:22 - color black which is good that's all
66:24 - right yeah div
66:25 - should be the icon so i mean this
66:29 - search icon thingy because no it's fine
66:32 - yeah yeah that's fine so i think the
66:35 - nice thing to focus on is let's go to
66:36 - add some spacing around these
66:38 - specific portions okay so this portion
66:41 - and so forth so
66:42 - for the hello select your address let's
66:44 - go back to here where is
66:46 - it this one right here option line one
66:48 - option line
66:50 - two a few things we need to create here
66:52 - on the hello select your address which
66:53 - is gonna be what
66:55 - what is it gonna be i mean you
66:58 - definitely
66:59 - uh add a little margin right to the
67:01 - header option address
67:03 - good good good go that way that way we
67:05 - don't have to worry about the rows then
67:07 - uh
67:07 - themselves um
67:11 - so i'm not sure if you want to scroll
67:13 - down or not all right one thing i want
67:15 - to do for the okay so a few things i
67:16 - want to do i want to go ahead for the
67:17 - option address right here
67:19 - this option address i here's a really
67:21 - cool thing i can do command click on
67:23 - this and this watch should take me
67:24 - straight to it you see this button
67:25 - before look at this
67:27 - i know cool right now i have to scroll
67:29 - down yeah i know
67:30 - i know chicory stuff huh so command
67:32 - click or control click on it for example
67:34 - if you're on windows
67:35 - so i can do for example padding for this
67:38 - one i will say padding left
67:42 - left let's go ahead and do 9 pixels so
67:44 - you actually kind of move it a little
67:46 - bit more to where i want it to be
67:48 - okay good all right that's awesome so
67:50 - that's more padding
67:51 - and i want to add more padding as well
67:53 - to the
67:54 - the header search itself too i think
67:58 - that's going to going to be really
67:59 - really important okay
68:00 - so on that specific portion let's go
68:03 - ahead and do
68:06 - also let's go to header where is it i'm
68:08 - going to close this out
68:10 - and we'll do do a header where's the
68:12 - header search where is it where's the
68:13 - rest of the header search
68:15 - there we go so command click on the
68:17 - header search right there
68:19 - beautiful and then what i will do in
68:21 - this case is pretty simple
68:23 - is i will go ahead and do
68:26 - padding left five pixels yeah actually
68:29 - no yeah let's do that
68:30 - let's do i mean yeah you can add like
68:32 - horizontal padding

73:39 - ahead and do that let's go ahead and do
73:40 - it on here
73:41 - the way that that works guys it's very
73:43 - simple if i go to the head that css
73:47 - uh if i go to the header here what where
73:50 - is our header well it's very
73:51 - simple it's the header search which is
73:54 - right here a header search cont no
73:57 - header search
73:58 - okay to add that i want you to
74:01 - look at this okay this is really cool
74:03 - really cool let me go and find it where
74:05 - where i usually have it but because okay
74:08 - so the way this works is the following i
74:11 - do focus within look at this
74:14 - i can do focus within so here
74:17 - on the header search i say focus with a
74:21 - mini if i
74:22 - anything that's on focus on the inside
74:24 - of it i will do
74:25 - the following i will do box shadow look
74:28 - at this guys
74:29 - a box shadow boom right there
74:32 - nope this is focused it's cool right
74:34 - it's so cool
74:35 - all right i'm also going to give it a
74:37 - background color of white let's see a
74:39 - background color of white
74:40 - okay back
74:44 - ground around let's see background
74:47 - color of white

74:55 - i think that's pretty much it on the
74:56 - side of the actual you know
74:58 - input stuff and i'm going to also for
75:01 - the border now that's good
75:02 - all right so let's go ahead and save
75:04 - that all right oh look at that
75:07 - look at this that looks so good
75:10 - and now and then you see how there's
75:12 - this weird
75:13 - thing going on with this border and i'm
75:15 - like oh my god i don't get it
75:17 - but that's okay because it all it's it's
75:19 - a very simple fix i go to here header
75:21 - search input

77:19 - portion right so we need to be able to
77:20 - get add this specific portion right here
77:24 - and then we'll add the card what i want
77:26 - to do now is the following
77:28 - let's add the actual cart you'll see
77:31 - why in a second okay so
77:35 - um on the card section let's take a look
77:38 - at this all right
77:39 - now how do we actually do that
77:43 - right how do we go ahead and have a cart
77:46 - that's going to work
77:47 - with us that's a good question well the
77:50 - following if i go to
77:51 - my app.js okay my header is there
77:54 - i can also add a card so i'm going to
77:56 - create a card component i will do a new
77:58 - file and i will say card.js this is
78:00 - going to be our cart page guys card.js
78:02 - okay
78:03 - oh i'll do rfce and rcv
78:06 - rfc is just an extension guys for you to
78:10 - be able to
78:10 - have shortcuts if you don't have the
78:12 - shortcut there's no problem to install
78:14 - the shortcut you have to go to
78:15 - extensions and do es7
78:17 - react redux right here react redux uh
78:20 - uh what is what it's called components
78:22 - is what i shall call it right yeah
78:24 - actually if you type in es7 it's going
78:26 - this is going to be the first one to
78:27 - shoot react without
78:29 - you uh snippet something there awesome
78:32 - sweet
78:32 - all right what did i just do whatever
78:33 - happened okay there we go good
78:35 - job let's go back to the gs header
78:38 - no contain the header can you can it can
78:40 - you have that good good good i like it
78:43 - all right okay next up i'm going to add
78:45 - the card so i'm going to say cart
78:47 - as well in here david
78:50 - damn it no i'm i'm not even
78:54 - touching it that's so interesting okay
78:55 - good and then what's going to happen is
78:56 - i'm going to import the card so you have
78:58 - this card right here i'm going to save
78:59 - this card
79:00 - go up the gs i'm going to import this
79:02 - card so import
79:04 - cart from
79:08 - damn it no come on
79:12 - good good good good good nice
79:16 - and now we have the card now we don't
79:17 - see anything but that's okay
79:19 - i'll go to cut that gs i'm saying
79:24 - all right there so this is the card now
79:27 - but
79:28 - the question is now how to differentiate
79:30 - this from the home page
79:32 - well it's a few very different things
79:34 - okay we're going to use something
79:36 - called your router i'm going to create
79:37 - another page called home so let's go to
79:39 - source
79:41 - source new file and we'll go ahead and
79:43 - say home.gs right there
79:45 - okay i'm the gs and do rfce
79:48 - good that's going to create the home one
79:51 - and i'm gonna say this is home
79:53 - good let's go back to app.gs awesome
79:56 - and we'll also do home
80:00 - so almost undefined it's gonna import
80:03 - say import
80:05 - home from what from
80:09 - home right there good nice so now we
80:12 - have two pages we have the card page
80:14 - and we also have the home page now how
80:18 - do we
80:18 - if i click on one how do i get to the
80:20 - other one that's going to be a good
80:22 - question well
80:23 - we're going to use something called
80:24 - react router down guys
80:26 - react router dom right there
80:29 - not dom dom
80:33 - right there so in react writer down will
80:35 - allow us to be able to navigate between
80:38 - pages kind of like when you have for
80:39 - example you know facebook you have a
80:41 - news feed page
80:42 - and then you have for example netflix
80:44 - you have you know a page where you have
80:45 - all your movies and then you have a page
80:47 - where you have all the you know an
80:49 - individual movie and so forth well
80:50 - this will allow us to do that and
80:56 - i'm sorry i already loaded it i already
81:00 - typed it in
81:00 - in the terminal thank you so let's go
81:02 - ahead and hold up the terminal
81:04 - how do i do how do i open into a
81:05 - terminal let me see
81:07 - command j let me see sh is it the one
81:11 - right there so you can see dave is going
81:12 - to type it in right there
81:14 - npmi react router dumb let's go to
81:17 - install it
81:18 - beautiful it's basically just
81:22 - and it's actually switching between
81:25 - pages without
81:26 - loading or reloading so you know with
81:28 - normal pages
81:30 - when you click a link it's going to like
81:32 - go super slow and it's just
81:34 - loading and stuff this case boom
81:37 - you're there exactly exactly so the way
81:40 - it works is very simple this for example
81:42 - right here is a link so you can link to
81:44 - different pages
81:45 - and this is the actual route we have a
81:47 - switch and there's we have a route for
81:49 - the about page
81:50 - a route for the users page right and so
81:52 - forth and so forth let me
81:54 - put this up for you so you guys can see
81:55 - it better okay
81:57 - right there right there so we'll do the
81:59 - same thing in our situation as well i'm
82:01 - going to make this just a tad smaller
82:03 - it's a bit too big
82:04 - all right good so in our case here's
82:06 - what we'll do
82:07 - we'll have the header which is always
82:08 - going to be here because the header is
82:09 - something in common
82:11 - that both the about on to the card page
82:14 - and the home page have
82:15 - so what we will do is i will i will now
82:17 - import react router
82:19 - react router dom i will say import
82:22 - here i'm going to say import and check
82:25 - this out guys pay a close
82:27 - attention okay we'll do right here
82:30 - import browser router as router that's
82:32 - the first i'm going to import so i'm
82:33 - going to say
82:36 - boom browser router as router comma
82:39 - switch
82:41 - comma what route
82:44 - comma what link where we import this
82:48 - from
82:50 - from react boom
82:54 - router dash dumb done
82:57 - done so okay kaput
83:01 - good now good mo
83:04 - all right so we're going to follow the
83:05 - same path as they are showing us here
83:07 - which is a switch with
83:08 - with the route okay we're going to
83:09 - follow the same path i will go ahead and
83:11 - do like this we'll say
83:12 - so we'll say switch initially that's
83:15 - correct but before you do that
83:17 - you just have to put the whole thing in
83:19 - a router
83:20 - oh [ __ ] you're right my bad my bad my
83:22 - bad sorry that's all right i got you bro
83:25 - you got me so you have to put the whole
83:26 - thing in the router because you can see
83:27 - here
83:28 - this right here is router right there so
83:30 - good this thank you so much
83:32 - so router good and then we'll do switch
83:34 - case and that's it and then
83:36 - this will now have different routes
83:38 - we'll have one route for the cart so
83:39 - we'll say
83:40 - route here route
83:44 - and the path for this one's gonna be
83:46 - path is gonna be
83:49 - dash cart okay and this will have the
83:52 - card page so we'll say the card
83:53 - component some say cart
83:56 - boom right there the next route is gonna
83:58 - be which one
84:01 - next route is going to be nothing
84:04 - the home page right there's the homepage
84:06 - then there's the cart page
84:07 - and this will have the actual home page
84:10 - i like to call it
84:12 - so home boom boom that's the one
84:15 - okay remove all this stuff and boom
84:18 - shakalaka we got it
84:21 - okay i just do a little bit of spacing
84:23 - good and i want to add that
84:25 - that you always want to make sure that
84:27 - the last one
84:29 - in this case like in a switch like this
84:32 - is
84:32 - always the slash because that's pretty
84:34 - much the full uh the fall back off
84:36 - that's the fallback okay
84:38 - meaning if nothing else works if for
84:39 - example let's say you type in dash about
84:41 - and the route is not there it will go to
84:43 - the homepage so what is the helper
84:44 - somebody asked the homepage guys is this
84:46 - page guys this is the homepage right
84:48 - here
84:48 - the homepage is this page the cart page
84:52 - is this page okay and so we've got how
84:54 - to create those two pages
84:55 - understood comprende comprende good
84:59 - all right comprende comprende awesome
85:03 - so look at this now you see currently
85:05 - we're on the homepage because that's the
85:06 - default page as you can see right
85:07 - only shows home but if i type in cart
85:11 - if i type in cart check this out
85:15 - yeah boom it has the card page now you
85:18 - see that right there
85:20 - it has the clicker page exactly and i
85:22 - can actually now
85:23 - link it i can link the card page to when
85:26 - i go ahead and actually
85:27 - click on the card right here
85:30 - let's go ahead and do that right now
85:32 - right now so i go ahead and go click on
85:33 - the cart
85:34 - where's my card my card is right here
85:37 - my card is where where's my my link my

85:49 - course the first thing we want to go
85:50 - ahead and do
85:50 - okay you got it okay so let's go ahead
85:53 - and import the link
85:55 - nice the only one we're going to use is
85:57 - just simply the link one we don't need
85:58 - to use this one at this portion at all
86:00 - just the link from three backfire down
86:02 - and then what we will go ahead and do
86:04 - we'll do

86:32 - so now we just yeah what's up
86:36 - so why okay it's good
86:40 - don't worry we'll fix this so check this
86:42 - out okay this the reason why it looks
86:44 - hideous is the following because when
86:46 - you do a link to a cart
86:48 - it's going to put an a tag you see we
86:50 - before we had an a
86:51 - a div now it's a whole a tag which is
86:53 - completely fine okay
86:55 - all we got to do is for the attack now
86:56 - do display flex and then
86:58 - all we got to do is make it vertically
86:59 - aligned so let's go to
87:04 - actually maybe let's do it this way i'm
87:07 - gonna do a little bit smarter here so
87:08 - i'm gonna say you can link to here
87:10 - i'm gonna say boom link to inside here
87:14 - i'm do it this way okay i think it'll be
87:16 - a lot easier for us this way
87:18 - i think that will still be oh
87:22 - okay good nice good nice
87:26 - nice nice that's a little bit better now
87:27 - it's a little bit better it's not as bad
87:29 - as it was well used to be
87:30 - before but what we do now is on the a so
87:33 - we'll do header option card let's go to
87:35 - header option card which is below
87:36 - somewhere here
87:38 - or is it header option card okay i will
87:41 - say
87:41 - e and then uh here i will say
87:45 - everything display flex
87:50 - boom oh oh you see you didn't believe me
87:55 - i didn't no i did i just didn't know
87:57 - what what your goal was boom
88:00 - look at that okay let's go ahead and do
88:02 - at this point the following
88:05 - we'll do color white for this one so we
88:07 - have to change the color
88:10 - okay right there and again the reason
88:12 - why um what just happened here
88:18 - no use for display flag
88:22 - yeah this one bro display flex
88:26 - now display flex still needs to be on
88:28 - here good
88:30 - good you see right there so the reason
88:32 - why we have to change the color on here
88:33 - guys is because by default the a tag has
88:36 - a weird color i have no idea why
88:39 - but it does okay so what they follow the
88:41 - a tag which is a link tag has that
88:43 - has a really work out so we did remove
88:45 - that and also
88:46 - for that we need to remove the text
88:48 - decoration so say text decoration
88:50 - and the text equation is this underline
88:52 - right here you can see right there you
88:53 - see
88:54 - that's the text decoration right there
88:56 - so do text dash
88:57 - decoration ratio and this could be none
89:03 - bomb voila look at that now look at this
89:06 - if i now go to the home page
89:10 - boom home page if i click on the cart
89:13 - boom we're on the cart page how cool is
89:15 - that huh
89:36 - wait that's not me there we go

92:09 - a few things let's convert this to a
92:11 - container
92:13 - container because we're going to use
92:14 - components as always
92:16 - container yeah while you do that i'm
92:18 - just going to be importing the solder
92:20 - component
92:21 - silently so here's important to style
92:22 - the components right and
92:24 - right there beautiful so container
92:26 - container container awesome
92:27 - save this uh for some reasons give
92:30 - yelling me for some reason
92:32 - what are you doing let's let's redo the
92:35 - whole thing

92:48 - go we'll be good it'll be good
92:49 - hi all right
92:56 - yeah okay no container that's fine
93:01 - div i likes nothing
93:04 - ah that's fine rfc is the new way what
93:07 - i'm saying like we are at the very
93:08 - beginning of the
93:09 - okay
93:14 - i think he has to start with some of the
93:15 - use code honestly
93:17 - there you go microsoft product yeah
93:20 - oh come on bro no i didn't say anything
93:25 - all right so cool so let's go into const
93:27 - container let's go ahead and create the
93:28 - style component guys
93:29 - you could do style.div okay okay
93:32 - good good good good nice stella there
93:35 - again this is a component guys okay
93:37 - and this container is gonna not don't
93:38 - worry about that yes so much but
93:40 - this will have two things one is gonna
93:41 - be the home banner
93:43 - right there so let's go ahead and do a
93:45 - one for a home
93:46 - banner okay so we'll say home
93:50 - actually just do banner so do banner
93:52 - like this
93:53 - okay let's give you the banner and then
93:55 - the last one is going to be
93:57 - the content okay that's going to be the
94:00 - content of the home so the content is
94:02 - going to be actually what
94:03 - it's going to be these portions so
94:05 - anything that's in here
94:07 - and that is considered something like
94:09 - content understood
94:10 - comprende good so i'm going to say
94:12 - content underneath this one
94:14 - good oh
94:18 - look at this that looks so cool i'm not
94:21 - sure what is that what that is but
94:22 - that's okay
94:23 - so content now the banner is gonna be
94:25 - very simple guys we need to make that
94:27 - banner into a much better form all right
94:30 - so for the banner well the banner you
94:32 - can see it has a background image
94:34 - and let's take a look at how do we
94:35 - actually do it if i go ahead and go to
94:37 - the banner and i do style.div
94:39 - let's see i'm going to say background
94:41 - image
94:43 - background image is something i'm not
94:46 - really sure what
94:47 - but it's going to be this portion right
94:49 - here so let me see
94:50 - style background image it's going to be
94:52 - this url which i have provided for you
94:54 - right there
94:55 - beautiful right there okay let's go and
94:59 - save this good good good good
95:00 - i can you gonna copy this and paste it
95:02 - in for for everybody to see of course
95:05 - god beautiful
95:08 - good good good nice nice nice background
95:11 - image good so that's gonna be the
95:12 - background image of this specific
95:14 - content
95:14 - and let's also now go ahead and give
95:16 - this one a uh you know we need to give
95:18 - it a minimum height so i'm going to say
95:20 - minimum height
95:22 - so min height
95:25 - min height of 600 pixels
95:29 - david can you not highlight this please
95:33 - david you're not highlighting highlight
95:35 - yeah don't highlight it good thank you
95:36 - all right mini height and then let's see
95:39 - what happens now if i go ahead and go to
95:40 - helm banner let's see what happens now
95:42 - container is not refined well because
95:45 - it's not contains container
95:47 - there we go god god that's a typo i know
95:50 - it's fine
95:51 - we all have typos it's okay not the end
95:53 - of the world it's all good
95:55 - it's all good right so
95:58 - nothing's going on so far right you have
96:00 - many height of 600 pixels
96:01 - but because of what it actually
96:03 - shouldn't be in the content it should be
96:05 - where guys hopefully got that it should
96:06 - be on the banner
96:09 - that was a test for you not for me
96:13 - i didn't even realize i failed that test
96:17 - oh that's funny right we also made this
96:19 - background image in a bad way
96:21 - this should be url like so okay
96:25 - god and so we're gonna put that ah short
96:29 - url i'm gonna give it like this
96:32 - bomb right there god
96:36 - nice look at that beautiful so we've got
96:39 - something along the lines 743 likes holy
96:42 - [ __ ] guys
96:42 - can we get to a thousand let's put let's
96:46 - say that let's do it to a thousand
96:48 - thousand i mean we have 335 people live
96:52 - so if
96:52 - everybody smashes in we should be good
96:55 - if everybody smash that like button like
96:56 - crazy that would be great
96:57 - so yeah main height of oh look at this
96:59 - 600 pixels look at that it's looking
97:00 - starting to look so so much better
97:02 - one thing i want to fix now is the
97:03 - following is the positioning of this
97:05 - background as you can see it's way too
97:07 - big
97:08 - right it's way too big not something i
97:10 - will like like to use right
97:12 - well that's why david here is doing
97:14 - background position position
97:16 - right there that's centered that's gonna
97:18 - center it right there it's gonna center
97:20 - it
97:20 - horizontally and then he's gonna do
97:22 - background size
97:24 - cover now what does that mean let's go
97:27 - into so it's
97:28 - super uh super quickly background
97:31 - position
97:32 - is the position of the background so if
97:34 - it's center
97:35 - basically it makes sure that the
97:36 - background images center is going to be
97:39 - centered god god god god good now
97:42 - here is the cool part okay now listen up
97:45 - all right how do we go ahead right we've
97:48 - got this portion look at that i mean it
97:50 - looks pretty cool it's centered right
97:51 - it's all amazing right no problem
97:53 - whatsoever yeah the cover
97:54 - we didn't explain the cover we'll cover
97:57 - oh yes the cover thank you so much
97:59 - cover it's just make sure that it adapts
98:02 - no matter how big
98:03 - the window of the browser is it's going
98:06 - to be the
98:07 - it's going to like fill out the whole
98:08 - thing yeah so if i go back outside cover
98:11 - right there only give you just a few
98:13 - different uh
98:14 - ways you see so there's contain that
98:16 - there's cover
98:17 - which cover basically will take up as
98:19 - much space as it needs
98:21 - as it possibly can to fill up the whole
98:22 - diff so cover basically will
98:24 - always always fill up the div that's the
98:27 - big difference
98:28 - then we have back on contain that's
98:30 - going to basically make sure that the
98:31 - height
98:32 - because can and the width is contained
98:33 - within that div as well right so that's
98:35 - contained right there all right
98:37 - and that's pretty much the big
98:38 - difference honestly now
98:40 - now here's a question for you you see
98:42 - how we have this like um
98:44 - what's it called this you see how behind
98:47 - this there's like a
98:48 - it's a gradient how do we do that man
98:52 - we need to introduce something called
98:54 - linear
98:55 - gradient now that's actually not
98:57 - something
98:59 - uh that's super easy to type out but in
99:01 - this case we can actually do that
99:03 - yeah so look at this i mean i'm gonna
99:05 - copy paste this actually so
99:06 - they can see it so it's um i don't wanna
99:09 - i wanna confuse you guys too much but
99:10 - it's a linear gradient that's going to
99:12 - go from top to bottom
99:13 - and it's going to go look at this it's
99:15 - going to go from right here from black
99:18 - to white you see from black
99:22 - to well no this is still from um
99:25 - from fully black right here right there
99:28 - oh
99:28 - yeah no no fully black with zero opacity
99:32 - you see with zero opacity basically and
99:34 - what we're doing
99:35 - is we're masking the image and when you
99:37 - mask the image
99:39 - the black portion becomes transparent
99:42 - okay that's how that's the way that
99:43 - works and so if i go ahead and
99:45 - save this guys take a look at this if i
99:47 - say this
99:48 - boom right there this is what we have
99:52 - you see now look at this without this
99:57 - boom with this
100:00 - boom donezo
100:04 - done wow how cool is that guys what do
100:06 - you guys think huh
100:08 - what do you guys think that is pretty i
100:11 - would say that's pretty insane i will
100:12 - say i'll
100:13 - say i like that a lot so look at that
100:15 - what do you guys think let me know
100:16 - oh let me see who linear gradient
100:19 - beautiful
100:20 - rgba amazing somebody's saying your ass
100:23 - smash that thumbs up guys yes you guys
100:25 - know it of course
100:26 - always always hell yeah
100:30 - thumbs up beautiful all right awesome
100:32 - let's go continue on
100:38 - all right so we got that portion now
100:40 - it's going to work on the content
100:42 - section which is going to be
100:43 - the those product divs okay the content
100:46 - is actually going to be this section
100:47 - let's just for now let's make the
100:49 - section for example just background
100:50 - background white for now background
100:56 - white background white
100:59 - all right let's go and save this okay
101:02 - nothing so far okay
101:04 - back on why because why the content
101:05 - literally has nothing inside so i'm
101:07 - gonna say i'm gonna say
101:11 - [Laughter]
101:14 - don't judge all right no i don't
101:18 - no no i just be myself i know i know
101:22 - no for the background white if you look
101:24 - at our actual clone as you can see
101:26 - you see there's one number first thing
101:27 - is you will do is you see there's
101:29 - there's some padding as well and there's
101:32 - a max
101:32 - width to where it goes you see this
101:34 - right here there's a max width
101:35 - um so here's how we kind of want to go
101:38 - ahead and do it
101:38 - for the content section here's what's
101:41 - going to happen well
101:43 - number one the container for this
101:46 - container we're going to give the max
101:47 - width so for this container let's do max
101:51 - width width
101:56 - max width of what or 1500 pixels
102:00 - look right to the south now what does
102:02 - this mean if i go ahead and go to here
102:05 - you see you see that's a max without a
102:08 - 500 or
102:09 - 1500 pixels but but check this out
102:12 - you see how do we now center this image
102:13 - this whole container i want it to be
102:15 - centered in the middle
102:16 - so that it's kind of like right here now
102:19 - we can do that use something called
102:20 - margin zero auto okay if i do this
102:24 - boom okay if i do margin
102:28 - margin right here now if i zero auto
102:32 - okay now watch this watch this watch
102:35 - remember before
102:36 - watch this boom right there now we have
102:39 - ourselves
102:40 - a fully centered div that's called
102:42 - margin zero auto okay just so you guys
102:44 - understand
102:45 - beautiful and now with that said what
102:48 - now let's think about what we're going
102:49 - to do
102:51 - for the content the content is now here
102:53 - which is beautiful it's amazing
102:55 - okay i'm going to for the content i'm
102:57 - going to give it a padding so i'm going
102:58 - to say padding left
103:00 - pending left of 10 pixels
103:03 - and i will say padding right
103:07 - of 10 pixels as well boom so i just
103:10 - pushed this to the
103:11 - this side okay now big problem here
103:15 - big problemo how do we move it up how do
103:18 - we move these products up that's a good
103:19 - question what do you think david
103:22 - what do you think i would say margin
103:24 - margin minus something
103:26 - so so check this out this is really cool
103:28 - i want you guys
103:29 - i want you guys to pay attention really
103:31 - closely here okay while i'll take a sip
103:32 - of water
103:34 - [Laughter]
103:36 - oh yeah hydration don't pay attention to
103:38 - me pay attention to the code
103:40 - all right so look at this um one really
103:44 - cool thing with margin
103:46 - all right so are you listening let me
103:49 - know in the comments you're listening
103:50 - check this out if i have for example
103:52 - margin here
103:54 - let's say this is this is the content
103:55 - okay
103:57 - now margin pushes it up so for example
103:59 - margin up let's say six pixels
104:02 - right it's gonna push this what this
104:04 - container down correct
104:06 - this whole container is going to go down
104:07 - yes or no correct if i do margin top six
104:10 - pistols yes or no
104:12 - but here's my question what if i do
104:15 - margin
104:16 - top minus six pixels
104:21 - the opposite what if i do that
104:25 - and it's gonna be negative margin so
104:27 - look instead of pushing
104:28 - basically instead of pushing it down
104:31 - instead of creating space
104:33 - here it's actually going to push it
104:36 - up so margin top minus six pistol is
104:40 - basically like
104:42 - it's basically like for example taking
104:44 - this container right here taking this
104:45 - container boom
104:46 - and literally moving this container this
104:49 - whole container
104:50 - this whole container i'll put a circle
104:52 - up with minus
104:54 - six pixels right so what is the issue
104:57 - right now the issue is very simple well
105:00 - the issue right now is that we have this
105:03 - thing which is all the way here
105:05 - now how do we move it up so that it is
105:09 - where
105:11 - right here it should be right yeah
105:14 - what do we do tell me what do we do tell
105:17 - me huh
105:18 - well that is what we do yeah what we can
105:20 - do is we can do margin top
105:23 - margin top guys yeah
105:27 - and i would say 350 pixels in negative
105:30 - margin this top minus 350
105:35 - pixels boom shakalaka we got this
105:38 - [Laughter]
105:42 - a margin margin
105:45 - hey look at that you see that right
105:47 - there
105:48 - margin top right there
105:52 - that's all honestly we needed that's
105:54 - pretty much
105:55 - it how cool is that what do you think
105:59 - i think that's pretty cool huh i think
106:01 - it's pretty super cool yeah i think it's
106:02 - pretty cool i love it
106:03 - right so that's pretty awesome so now we
106:06 - have what's up
106:07 - let me just ask you this because uh it
106:10 - just came into my mind too
106:11 - somebody in the comment whole dot asks
106:14 - uh what if
106:14 - what about position absolute what's your
106:17 - take on that
106:18 - so position absolute is not something
106:20 - you want to use you
106:21 - try not to install it on in any case
106:25 - position of salute is going to position
106:27 - it like directly there
106:29 - um it's a people don't use it
106:33 - you are not going to be able to scroll
106:35 - because you won't be able to scroll
106:36 - exactly
106:38 - well no technically you still be able to
106:39 - scroll it's fine but the position of
106:41 - silhouette is
106:41 - if you make a relative to that
106:43 - specification item i highly recommend
106:45 - you don't do something like that
106:46 - it takes it it takes the whole thing out
106:47 - of context so for example let's say
106:49 - there's a
106:50 - you know you know there's imagine this
106:53 - if you have pages right it goes one page
106:56 - after the other page right
106:58 - if you do position absolute it's the
106:59 - same thing as
107:01 - taking this page ripping it out
107:04 - oh [ __ ] hold on rip it
107:07 - ripping out the page and then absolutely
107:10 - position it
107:11 - come on absolutely position it anywhere
107:14 - you want
107:15 - okay that's called position absolute so
107:17 - let's say absolute top
107:19 - you see it's lost absolute position
107:22 - has lost its context where it actually
107:25 - is if you
107:25 - move the pat notepad the that single
107:28 - piece of paper is not going to move but
107:30 - exactly exactly so that's what you guys
107:32 - need to understand you want to use it
107:33 - use it as less
107:35 - as possible was that a pretty cool
107:36 - explanation to you guys i think so too
107:39 - [Laughter]
107:42 - so i said absolute is bad for your
107:44 - health
107:47 - yeah so i would recommend you guys not
107:49 - do that okay
107:51 - now what's gonna happen now is let's go
107:53 - how much do we have we have about
107:55 - 10 minutes that's just fine that's fine
107:57 - so we got that portion
107:58 - the next thing on a portion is let's go
108:00 - ahead and actually go ahead and create
108:02 - the product

109:04 - that is amazing that is what i think
109:06 - it's production already bro
109:08 - i i really i really did pretty much
109:10 - professionally it's pretty much i would
109:11 - say so
109:12 - i would say so all right so sweet
109:15 - so look we got that portion now let's go
109:17 - ahead back to our amazon logo
109:19 - let's create in our product page so so
109:21 - if we think about this okay
109:23 - we have a few things now well what do we
109:25 - have we have this right here we have
109:27 - this right and we have this correct
109:30 - mundo yes we do all right so the next
109:33 - thing to do is we need to now
109:35 - create what a product
109:38 - okay a product now a product here
109:41 - is in multiple rows right we have this
109:43 - is one row
109:45 - right here and then we have three
109:47 - products in
109:48 - this row correct mundo
109:51 - yes indeed so let's actually work on
109:54 - that
109:55 - we're calling in the home page okay
109:57 - we're calling the home page
109:59 - i want us to create two products okay
110:01 - let's think about this now
110:03 - if i'm on the home page okay on the
110:05 - content page
110:06 - all right let's now create what what do
110:10 - you guys think let's create the product

111:38 - going to say product here
111:40 - product product
111:44 - boom done probably fine
111:47 - perfect product not defined because i
111:49 - probably wrong good
111:51 - all right so producto is right there
111:52 - awesome now producto is going to have a
111:55 - few different things
111:56 - it's going to have a container here okay
111:59 - good because it's going to do style
112:01 - components so we'll say here
112:03 - import what are we importing david
112:06 - uh you need to be importing the style
112:08 - from styled components
112:12 - [Music]
112:14 - what did you do bro i don't know didn't
112:16 - like me
112:17 - [Laughter]
112:20 - from i got this
112:23 - styled dash
112:26 - components equals components okay good
112:30 - good good good good good so
112:31 - save that let's refresh this
112:35 - containers are defined perfect because
112:37 - why you do const container
112:41 - and you can see guys as i'm going
112:43 - through this stuff right
112:44 - i'm always able to solve the problem
112:47 - very pretty much simply just by kind of
112:49 - going one by one
112:50 - one step at a time as part of coding
112:53 - you're doing things
112:54 - one step at a time that's one thing when
112:55 - i'll make sure you guys understand we'll
112:57 - do background color here
113:02 - color let's do background color we're
113:04 - going to say white
113:06 - correct white
113:10 - but come on somebody came in
113:14 - with russian what that's what it could
113:16 - be that's fine
113:17 - what do you mean ukrainian and russian
113:18 - is fine where but you move
113:20 - no no i was just checking if anybody
113:24 - speaks spanish i mean
113:25 - somebody said johan says johanna say why
113:28 - don't you guys respond guys i mean we're
113:29 - trying to respond we're also coding
113:30 - you know we got 10 things at the same
113:31 - time you know it's really hard to code
113:33 - and respond at the same time guys all
113:35 - right
113:36 - somebody said are we building the back
113:37 - end no we are building the front end
113:39 - guys okay something no hablo espanol
113:41 - that's funny
113:44 - product wow wow
113:47 - so are we also creating the back end
113:48 - that could support a multi-vendor
113:50 - marketplace or is it just a front
113:51 - so we're doing the front end right now
113:53 - so we're doing the front right now
113:55 - and then we'll have a back end side of
113:56 - things where we'll be able to connect
113:57 - this with a database okay that's what
113:59 - we're working on guys just so you know
114:00 - all right so get the background color
114:02 - white
114:03 - might did i say background color white
114:04 - correct by the way did it right
114:08 - okay uh yeah i think so now the reason
114:11 - why
114:11 - the background color white on the
114:12 - container is not showing up is
114:14 - well a few very simple things let me go
114:16 - ahead and inspect down with them this
114:17 - morning
114:18 - do we even initialize that
114:22 - yeah we did don't worry about it you did
114:24 - okay so let's go ahead and inspect them
114:25 - on this one
114:27 - yeah where is it
114:31 - right there's a product right there
114:35 - good good good good now this product has
114:37 - a background color what exactly
114:39 - now check this out if i do see index
114:45 - how do i do a hundred okay maybe i gotta
114:47 - do z
114:48 - what's up what'd you say
114:52 - i said something magical is happening
114:54 - what is magic what's happening
114:55 - i mean you're covering the the whole
114:58 - thing that that
114:59 - that's happening so so look guys
115:03 - you can see right now we have see text
115:05 - and it's kind of like see-through it's
115:06 - transparent is that correct
115:08 - that's right right so the issue that's
115:10 - going on right now is this this linear
115:12 - gradient color thing the bob
115:14 - is preventing a lot of things from
115:16 - happening which is very unfortunate
115:18 - because i don't like it because well i
115:21 - mean you'll see why in a second here but
115:23 - what i want to do is for the product
115:25 - number one i'm going to make this
115:26 - product a z-index
115:28 - c index of a hundred
115:32 - okay good okay that's fine
115:36 - and then i'm going to go to for example
115:38 - home.js
115:40 - i'm going to make this i'm going to
115:41 - remove this i don't need this anymore
115:44 - all right okay that's the content here
115:48 - and this will also be the content will
115:50 - also be what
115:52 - a z index of 100
115:57 - pixels okay it's still not working the
116:00 - way i want to be but now look at this if
116:02 - i go to the banner
116:03 - and i see z index you don't have to have
116:07 - to
116:12 - pick
116:14 - not something i wanted to uh wait wait
116:16 - wait wait wait
116:17 - you you made the typo i just fixed it i
116:19 - got you bro yeah
116:20 - but it's still not the way i want it to
116:22 - be look at this the index of minus one
116:23 - you see that right
116:24 - you see i think no no i think you want
116:26 - to have one
116:28 - instead of uh z index boom and and you
116:31 - have you have to have one
116:33 - because the hundred is above one so it's
116:35 - going to be above anyway
116:36 - you're just being explicit about it okay
116:39 - so like you see it's still kind of not
116:42 - there to where i want it to be because
116:44 - the content is not still
116:45 - still not background color white what do
116:47 - we do in that case
116:48 - what do you think um i mean
116:51 - can you actually like point on the
116:53 - screen with the
116:55 - pointer yeah like where is the product
116:59 - because i still
117:00 - product is here this is the product okay
117:02 - there's a product right there
117:03 - okay right what we're trying to do is
117:05 - we're trying crea creating a div or
117:07 - trying to create a div
117:08 - right here and that's kind of the hard
117:10 - part that we're working somebody said
117:12 - put the index of one we did we put the
117:15 - index of one right
117:16 - here good let me see z index
117:19 - there was a some some thing that i had
117:21 - to do i forgot
117:22 - what did i do before to make this let me
117:24 - see what can we do in that case
117:26 - what can we do to fix this product to
117:28 - have an actual background color white
117:29 - because
117:30 - the problem right now is that this
117:32 - product is hidden
117:34 - wait what just do i just changed the
117:37 - background color to blue from
117:38 - white and it's for some reason it's now
117:41 - working but if i change it back to white
117:45 - uh wait what
117:50 - let me think let me think so banner is
117:52 - the index of one
117:57 - so product content let me see what did i
118:00 - do on here potentially embassy because i
118:02 - always have it in different situations
118:03 - too so
118:05 - um a thing has to do potentially with
118:10 - let's see max height so product what do
118:13 - you guys what do you guys think huh
118:15 - what do you guys think
118:18 - let me see use hex values this is the
118:21 - order only figure out with white bro
118:23 - try z x one z index two you didn't
118:25 - specify the size or two container and
118:27 - product component okay
118:28 - so let's try this so let's go ahead and
118:30 - do the product.gs let's do the size
118:32 - let's do width for example
118:36 - let's do the width on this one of like
118:38 - 300 200 pixels
118:41 - and let's do height
118:44 - also 300 pixels
118:48 - i think now you see the gradient
118:51 - what because the gradient has also been
118:53 - applied to this image too that's why
118:55 - so this is the okay huh
118:58 - okay that's just how it works don't
119:00 - worry about it
119:02 - so look let's see let's take a look at
119:04 - this and don't worry we'll figure it out
119:06 - let's see background color white that's
119:07 - fine i think it's partially because
119:10 - let me see if i go ahead and if i save
119:12 - this let's go to home.gs
119:14 - no it's still not it it's not what i
119:15 - wanted to do so z
119:17 - index of 100 that's fine
119:20 - maybe needs to be display flex what if i
119:22 - do display flex on it let me see
119:24 - if i do the banner
119:28 - whatever display flex on the content
119:31 - play
119:32 - flex oh look at that
119:39 - wait what oh that's
119:42 - funny oh that's funny
119:45 - oh man you just put a display flex in
119:48 - the content and it solved it
119:50 - yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't know why
119:56 - that's a big issue a lot of developers
119:57 - have like i don't know why guys
120:00 - i mean i kind of understand why what do
120:02 - you guys think why
120:03 - that's the case what do you think huh
120:05 - producto why did all of a sudden become
120:07 - that because
120:07 - the issue before this was the fact that
120:10 - basically producto was part of the mask
120:13 - right so it was being masked as well the
120:16 - second i put display flex though
120:19 - what if i do display block
120:23 - no display inline block
120:29 - no uh display flex i guess is the only
120:33 - option
120:34 - okay so that's a bit odd
120:37 - so i know right that's a little odd but
120:39 - that's fine
120:41 - it's really fun so the reason why it's
120:43 - like this actually is pretty fairly
120:45 - fairly simple guys
120:46 - check this out right i think it's it's
120:49 - because
120:50 - what jasmine goes in the comments
120:52 - because display flex fixes everything
120:54 - [Laughter]
120:58 - exactly
120:58 - [Laughter]
121:01 - exactly exactly
121:05 - oh guys somebody said guys
121:08 - if you have a problem just type display
121:10 - flex
121:14 - oh my god it's some sort of magic stuff
121:17 - position relative
121:18 - that could have been good you only said
121:19 - flex is a you only said flex is a must
121:24 - but granted look is the enix is still
121:26 - still important if i remove this this
121:28 - this won't work fully
121:30 - oh will it let me see content
121:33 - oh [ __ ] this i guess venus is not does
121:34 - not even matter here too much
121:36 - let me see so content hold on hold on so
121:38 - that's good so the index of one
121:39 - on this one i think because it creates
121:41 - it makes the content to be
121:43 - um like its own container i think that's
121:45 - why let's not be part of it so
121:47 - hey i think
122:01 - but how cool is that huh
122:06 - hmm somebody says because when you say
122:09 - display flex the product
122:10 - product flexes its muscles and gets seen
122:13 - by people since it doesn't have chicken
122:14 - arms
122:16 - oh my gosh that's the funniest one i've
122:19 - heard so far
122:23 - oh my god that's funny because the
122:25 - flexes it's
122:26 - muscles guys that's why yeah flex is
122:28 - always a savior there we go
122:30 - so that's interesting so that worked
122:32 - okay so that's cool so look at this now
122:34 - we have one product
122:35 - now let's think about this so if we had
122:36 - display flex okay
122:38 - what if we have two products now okay
122:40 - can i can i
122:41 - let's say this let's see go to product
122:44 - gs producto
122:45 - let's make this forget the width
122:50 - forget the width okay instead what i'm
122:53 - going to do
122:54 - is let's do this producto and now we'll
122:57 - go ahead and go the home.gs file
122:59 - and let's edit one more product so we
123:01 - have two one
123:04 - product oh done
123:07 - oh we have product
123:11 - sorry thoughts
123:17 - now what do you guys think we need to do
123:19 - in order to go ahead and spread these
123:20 - out
123:21 - you know so that they take up the full
123:22 - width well
123:24 - that's very simple all i gotta do is go
123:26 - to product
123:27 - right and i say producto and i say what
123:30 - flex
123:31 - if i remove the xenix here will still
123:32 - work

127:47 - all right so add to cart
127:48 - is right here nice okay
127:52 - so we have the layout of the whole thing
127:54 - let's do this
127:55 - the title i'm gonna give it some
127:56 - placeholder data right the title
127:58 - one right there right there you see i'm
128:00 - gonna copy literally this whatever you
128:01 - wanna do let's do for example ipad pro
128:03 - i don't know whatever you wanna do so
128:05 - ipad pro price
128:06 - is 1449 we could put in here too no
128:09 - problem whatsoever
128:10 - again this is please hold data for now
128:12 - and then we'll be able to use the
128:14 - database to actually get data
128:15 - now reading here's the cool thing about
128:18 - the reading the way we can do it is the
128:19 - following we can literally just do stars
128:22 - boom right exactly there's actually you
128:24 - can actually just copy
128:26 - the star emoji and actually paste it in
128:28 - there and that's the emoji that i want
128:29 - to show you right there it's it's pretty
128:31 - pretty
128:31 - cool i will say that and then finally we
128:33 - have the image and this down image is
128:35 - going to have a source of the following
128:37 - and he will go ahead and copy and paste
128:39 - this for you guys so you guys have it as
128:41 - well
128:41 - and then you have the add to cart button
128:42 - now let's define these things
128:45 - underneath oh it's already been done
128:47 - never mind
128:50 - so the title is a styled p
128:53 - tag but actually i want it to be a style
128:56 - span tag not sp
128:57 - text pen okay and then
129:00 - for the price also style spin tag reason
129:04 - why i say span type because
129:05 - the p tag has a lot of uh styling that's
129:08 - automatically applied i don't want that
129:10 - that doesn't look so good i didn't
129:11 - know that it does it does then the
129:14 - product
129:14 - rating that's gonna be just a simple div
129:16 - then the aim is to be image add button
129:18 - is going to be a button now
129:19 - the button is going to have a few
129:20 - different things and we'll talk about
129:21 - that in a second here
129:23 - so now let's think about this the title
129:25 - now let's talk about the css of this
129:26 - stuff okay very important
129:28 - let's go and take a look at this what do
129:29 - we have so far
129:31 - oh [ __ ] what just happened oh look at
129:32 - this it works somehow wow that's cool it
129:35 - works guys look at this
129:36 - beautiful now of course it does i know i
129:39 - know i know and of course
129:40 - now so a few things for this thing okay
129:44 - one thing i want to do is make sure is
129:46 - let's go ahead and remove this
129:47 - min height instead i want to do is i
129:49 - want to add a max height for this
129:50 - actually let's do a max
129:52 - height for um should we do a max height
129:55 - what do you think
129:57 - yeah definitely i mean yeah let's do a
130:00 - match light
130:00 - big big screen yeah let's do a max
130:04 - height of 400 pixels on this one
130:06 - because it's too much max height or 400
130:10 - pixels
130:11 - because that will make maximum that will
130:13 - basically decrease the height of
130:14 - everything else which is good
130:16 - okay save that okay
130:19 - refresh it nothing's going to change so
130:21 - far so don't worry about that yeah okay
130:22 - that's gonna
130:22 - there's a reason why it's like this okay
130:24 - and then what's gonna happen the title
130:26 - uh let's do the following
130:30 - i think the title is fine let's go look
130:32 - at the price so the price is going to be
130:34 - the following
130:35 - so the price is going to be let's see
130:37 - font weight we're going to change the
130:39 - weight of this one
130:40 - to make it a little bit bolder so we'll
130:42 - say font weight of
130:43 - what 500. okay good make a little bit
130:47 - more
130:48 - price and then we'll do we'll do a few
130:50 - things in terms of like uh
130:52 - let's see font weight
130:55 - and then we'll give it a well nothing so
130:57 - far
130:58 - but check this out the price and the
131:01 - title
131:02 - you see how from the left from right
131:04 - well we need to actually make them
131:06 - from top to bottom so how do we go ahead
131:10 - and put the price from top to bottom
131:12 - or how do we put all these titles from
131:14 - top to bottom
131:15 - again display flags to the rescue

133:46 - i'm gonna make this smaller in that case
133:48 - with 100 pixels
133:51 - right and then what's going to happen is
133:53 - right there that's going to change the
133:54 - width of this button so let's go ahead
133:56 - if i go ahead and save this
133:59 - boom right now and then the background
134:00 - color is going to be this portion
134:02 - let's create this background color no
134:04 - problem
134:05 - okay now let's do the border for this
134:07 - specific thing okay
134:09 - let's do the border for this one so
134:10 - we'll do what good nice job
134:12 - so border two pixels solid and here
134:16 - this portion right here guys that's the
134:18 - width of the border
134:19 - that's the style of the border right
134:21 - here and this is the color of the border
134:22 - that's kind of how you do it right there
134:24 - okay guys good good good so if i go
134:26 - ahead and save this

134:31 - be what
134:33 - border radius of two pixels nice
134:38 - god god gotta go god go to god nice
134:41 - and what is it going to be i'm going to
134:43 - save that
134:44 - okay now we have a little bit of a
134:45 - circular button height of 30 pixels nice
134:49 - ah beautiful and look at that that looks
134:52 - so
134:53 - so so much better now we're not done yet
134:57 - how do you go ahead and center these now
134:59 - in a center because right now it's just
135:00 - like looks
135:01 - wonky right how do we stand this at the
135:04 - car button
135:05 - in the center what do you think huh
135:08 - what do you think i would just simply
135:12 - put like um
135:15 - use another div and then just put them
135:17 - in the center
135:19 - oh we can do it okay that's fine that's
135:22 - fine that's fine
135:23 - what i would honestly do is introduce
135:26 - a new div on the top here for the for
135:29 - all these details
135:31 - so those are not going to be centered
135:33 - but they are going to be aligned to the
135:34 - left
135:35 - okay that's fine everything is going to
135:37 - be centered
135:39 - good i like that or what we can do is
135:41 - very simple i can go to here check this
135:42 - out to decide i can do
135:44 - i can do this i can actually create
135:45 - different around here so i can do for
135:47 - example here
135:48 - i can i can say the action but action
135:52 - action uh section
135:55 - action section action section boom boom
135:58 - boom
136:00 - did you name it like that what's up
136:04 - action section the reason why we're
136:05 - creating this because look at this i
136:06 - want to be able to create another div
136:08 - that i can
136:09 - that can set so that it can go ahead and
136:11 - center everything in so
136:12 - action section look at this he's already
136:14 - creating action section div style.div
136:16 - and with this action section all i do is
136:18 - display flex okay display flags guys
136:21 - that's pretty much it and all i got to
136:23 - do is align no
136:24 - not just for content no not a lot items
136:26 - no no i don't i do both i do both
136:28 - fine okay you fancy pants okay that's
136:30 - fine
136:32 - and just if i can't descend it so what's
136:34 - gonna happen here is here's what we've
136:35 - done
136:36 - we created a container here called
136:38 - display flex
136:39 - and then what we did is we allowed it
136:41 - okay we allowed this div
136:43 - to be fully kind of centered vertically
136:45 - understood guys
136:46 - and this is why weed did that and so it
136:49 - makes things a lot a lot simpler for so
136:51 - many
136:51 - other reasons just so you guys know okay
136:55 - because that's good that's good we got
136:56 - the or or place items and that works
136:58 - that works too
136:59 - so now this is centered without the
137:02 - action section right here if we did
137:06 - place item center then the whole thing
137:08 - will be centered guys just so you know
137:10 - the whole thing
137:11 - this thing this thing everything but i
137:14 - just wanted this thing to be centered
137:15 - and so that's why i created we created
137:17 - another container beautiful
137:18 - now look at this this is pretty cool one
137:21 - last thing that i want to do david is
137:23 - you know what
137:26 - spacing okay that's fine spacing is good
137:28 - too yes that's that's important
137:30 - but not that what do you want to do then
137:33 - background color of this page
137:36 - of this full page guys we
137:40 - are almost done for today i'm not
137:42 - kidding we look at what we just created
137:43 - guys
137:44 - we have the banner we have the card page
137:47 - it looks sick okay now what i want to do
137:50 - is i'm going to go to the body
137:52 - let's go to here let's go to app.css
137:55 - for the body okay i want to change the
137:58 - background and color to this specific
138:00 - portion i'm going to copy this
138:02 - i got this david i got this duvet
138:05 - i know you want to type but it's here
138:07 - right there
138:08 - whoa look at this boom right there
138:12 - so here's what happens guys look at this
138:15 - this whole
138:16 - background color oh actually that's not
138:19 - good i don't like that
138:22 - okay wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
138:25 - wait wait i think it's because i need to
138:26 - go
138:27 - back to now my app.js
138:30 - and then for the div class name app
138:33 - let's see
138:34 - at this css i mean if you're not using
138:37 - css let's not do
138:38 - then let's not use css how do i make
138:41 - this whole thing
138:42 - color of that i mean then you want to go
138:45 - to app.js
138:47 - import style uh import
138:50 - style and no no no no no no no no no no
138:53 - no
138:54 - app but i need to make this background
138:58 - color of this maybe i need to make this
138:59 - background color
139:01 - i mean we can say app here instead of
139:05 - this this thing sort of what
139:10 - let's do it with a stop component
139:13 - right so if you go ahead uh in app.js we
139:16 - import styled
139:18 - components notice the
139:22 - rename the div uh with like th this this
139:26 - guy was a div
139:27 - and you can go into the app okay that's
139:28 - fine yeah i named it app
139:30 - and now i'm gonna um you can't
139:34 - absolutely div i mean it's still the
139:36 - same situation that's fine
139:38 - yeah well div
139:43 - and now we can or what was
139:46 - actually the background color what
139:50 - yeah yeah oh yeah okay and now it's the
139:53 - same situation
139:54 - what's up whoa
139:57 - that's new app has already been declared
140:01 - yes because you cannot do app into
140:02 - container david container then we do
140:05 - container

140:12 - container guys okay good so container is
140:14 - what we're gonna call okay good
140:16 - holy moly that's fine all right it's not
140:19 - like it still doesn't do what i want to
140:20 - do because here's the thing you see this
140:22 - bottom section
140:23 - i think it has to do something with the
140:25 - height i think that's what it has to do
140:27 - i think we need to work on the height of
140:28 - the actual thing let me see
140:30 - let me just think here for a second we
140:32 - have the app we have the app.css that's
140:34 - fine
140:36 - [Music]
140:38 - how do we go ahead what's going on here
140:40 - let me see inspect element icon color
140:43 - let me see a separate window
140:48 - where is that wait what's up let me see
140:50 - so what i'm trying to do
140:51 - is the background color you see how it's
140:54 - it's wonky here
140:55 - i don't like it so let me see minimum
140:58 - height
141:03 - that's fine that's fine
141:08 - back on what's there's add the linear
141:12 - gradient
141:13 - the what oh oh here's there we go that's
141:16 - why look at this right there you see
141:18 - this oh
141:20 - that's on the content so that's what was
141:22 - messed up the whole time you see this
141:24 - right there you see the guys so now this
141:26 - looks a lot lot better you see this
141:27 - background white that was the issue the
141:29 - whole time
141:29 - boom boom boom boom boom so if i go see
141:32 - this is why it's so important guys
141:34 - sometimes to be able to go for example
141:35 - to see the big picture this is why i
141:37 - like to go into an inspect element right
141:38 - here
141:39 - i like to see the big picture that we
141:41 - have and i can play around because
141:44 - you know going back and forth trying to
141:45 - try different things it's going to take
141:46 - a long time and react gs and so
141:48 - instead i like to go to stop you i like
141:50 - to inspect element
141:51 - go to it check check and check and check
141:53 - and see kind of what may change that
141:55 - makes
141:55 - and so that allows you to really easily
141:57 - see it and so what that does now if i go
141:59 - back to my home.gs
142:01 - if i go back to content with my content
142:04 - back on white you see i can just now
142:06 - remove this right there
142:08 - someone goes in the comments try to
142:09 - display flex hello
142:12 - display affects everything beautiful so
142:14 - guys
142:15 - look at this guys look at what we have

152:26 - aws versus firebase well um so
152:29 - good question i mean firebase is a very
152:32 - very popular you know
152:33 - uh database aws i mean is is more than
152:36 - just firebase just so you know guys know
152:38 - aws is everything it's been able to
152:40 - deploy
152:41 - to essences it's been able to have like
152:44 - if it is pretty much
152:45 - can do anything on you know for your
152:48 - project may that be to serve on the
152:50 - server may that be
152:51 - to have different servers but david to
152:52 - scale right firebase is mainly
152:55 - made for kind of database you know uh
152:57 - and so forth
152:59 - for example go ahead you can host of
153:02 - that
153:02 - oh yeah sorry yeah but aws for example
153:04 - has many different file
153:06 - databases like aws right so there's uh
153:09 - there's my sequel database there's a no
153:12 - sql database and so forth
153:13 - firebase is just a nosql database guys
153:16 - right and so
153:17 - there's a lot more to aws and voice and
153:20 - more recommend to learn

getting started on the code today so let's go let's get to it i am pumped hey oh all right guys so really really slowly you guys can see me beautiful okay so where do we start out okay in terms of this amazon clone okay we gotta start a few different places of course but what do we need to do well first thing i need to do guys is i've told you guys by the way i'm sure you guys know david here david say hi hey what's up good good good so what i want you guys to do is either mac or windows what you need to do is let's go ahead and open up a a folder any folder that you have so we have a folder here that we have a bunch of projects and on a mac what i like to do is i like to do right click i like to go ahead and for example let me go ahead and right click on a folder i like to do and then i do services and i do new terminal add folder okay so i'm going to create a project first so you should have vs code installed you should have had npm installed if you don't no problem again very important guys just as a disclaimer if you cannot keep up with me that's okay the point of this is for you guys to see what you can do okay so see what you're possible with coding all right think this is a magic show okay and so just enjoy it have fun you know be positive in the comments and that's it and then after the video then you come back and then you know do it right that is if you cannot keep up if you can keep up perfect no problemo let's see here what's up we got natalya going hi david that's amazing armando's saying i'm in it beautiful beautiful i love your guys's engagement awesome sweet sweet i'm going to put the comments in here so i can see just a little bit there we go there we go magic show natalia says that is amazing yes yes yes alright guys so what i want you guys to do is once you open up the terminal what you need to do is very simple it's going to clear some of this out and then again this could be windows or mac terminal and we're going to make this larger for you so you guys have see it okay there we go what i want you what you want to do is you want to npx create a dash react dash app okay that's the first thing you need to share your screens you yeah i'm sharing my screen now thank you so npx create react app and what this will do this will create a react project okay so it's going to call it the amazon clone let's just say challenge okay maybe that's what we do i'm going to call it challenge sound text create react now you can see sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't okay not an issue whatsoever i think it's because i need to go on cd and go back to github page there we go now this show works so i'm going to do mpx create dash react dash app and then we're going to do amazon dash clone dash challenge let's see there we go the right times on closed shell contains files that could that oh so basically we already have a project that looks like that so let's create a different project that says npx create react dash app i'm gonna say amazon clone amazon dash clone and dash challenge dash official how about that there we go beautiful and we are you know i mean we're going that's where we're going we're going on the bus what's up yo we got a donation from what's up on great to have great to have you here man thank you so much for the 15 donation i just recently landed a job for a company from by being in our boot camp after being a book which is insane so proud of you man i'm so proud to have students like that okay sweet all right let's go ahead all right so we woke up for like two months or something what's up he wasn't he wasn't even going through the whole boot camp he was in like for two months and he already got this job yeah it's insane only two months in he already he's already in it it's crazy right so all right perfect guys yeah so we got the project everybody see yes or no everybody see it there you go everybody says congrats on amazing amazing the bus with gas yes yes congrats on beautiful that's awesome sweet sweet sweet yo liquid i think i got it oh beautiful awesome so we have this is the project so as you can see when you go to this project after you start this project that's it you have the project there okay that's it the project is there right so let's go back to it and then what's going to happen now is when you open up the project vs code you should do file open so it's going to do vs code you want to file you want to open here right there and then as the file open you can see here i'm going to go back to my content my github and see this is the official so we create this one i have this one that's the one i created before i'm going to use this one but you should create the one use the one that you just created so let's click on the folder click open good and we have the project right here beautiful so now right away guys you have the project check this out think about this you have the project right there this is called a starter project and it has a fluid include includes a few files first files include the app.js then we have index.js you know and so forth and so forth and so forth where's my phone i know my phone goes my phone's on i'm not sure my phone is that's okay so so what now what these files are i'll explain it in a little bit guys no worries no worries uh one thing i want to do let's go actually create actually start up this project so what i want you to do is very simple you want to go ahead and right click on yarn lock right click on this and do open in integrated terminal okay all right and then what you want to do is you want to do npm inst mpm npm install is that right or npm start npm start yeah i'm starting start and what this does guys is this literally starts up the project for you okay beautiful i'm gonna say yes you might not have to say that because we already have the project there beautiful let's see let's see what do we have hey there we go that is the project we have right there so again now that was on clone i know i know it's not absolutely don't worry this is the starter project that react.js provides for us understood comprende comprende also now you want to share uh now you want to give me a live share all right now i'm going to give you the live share oh like did i change my stuff is that why someone do live nah it's the finished project that you gave me i think oh really oh man what was i thinking no i did not really know that's the one right here i'm showing you right there this one are you sure the project i'm sharing with you yeah this is the one david oh yeah this this is the one what are you talking about there all right david david what's wrong david so guys a few things that we need to do so let's go ahead and remove this deal let's remove this what i want you to do is i'll move this header right here we don't need that okay we need that you need the header and instead what i want you guys to focus on isn't it is a few things you see when you build a react.js project you build the right chest project it is very very simple right you want to think about how are we going to divide this project up right because when you think about um what's it called when you think about react js or anything or any any sort of project that you're building okay i'm going to split it up into a few parts okay and so what we're going to do right now is we're going to split up the components we'd like to call it all right so components are what components are building blocks is what i like to say so i'm going to say right there are building blocks and for example this header right here is a building block you see that right there that's a building block okay and then everything underneath the header is a building block right think of it as a block again anything that's a block it's a building block okay then what you got what do you have then you have this banner right here that's also a building block okay and then you have these small things right here and these are building blocks as well you see right there right there right there and right there okay so what we're going to do is we're going to think about a few different things that you know we need to work on in terms of to create this right remember big idea divide into small ideas okay so what's going to happen what's going to happen somebody says that can you make the font a little bigger you got it you got it i can make the phone a little bigger right here for you is that better i think it's better right i think it's better for you guys yeah yeah yeah i think so here we go that's better awesome so if what what i just said these are the guys the header so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to create a header component right that's going to be the part one that's for the part one that we're going to build so let's go ahead and look at this page you see if i refresh this page right if i go ahead and save this page and refresh this now it's a blank page don't worry don't panic it's all good all right no bueno all good so what i want to do instead is i'm going to create a header component because that's one of the building blocks that i just talked about right so this header component so what we're going to do is i'm going to source i'm going to say new file and we'll say header.js header.js right here dot gs go right there and that's going to be your component none again it's a javascript file but that's it it's going to contain everything so right as you can see david's already typing what he what david just typed i'm going to remove this for a second what david just typed is he typed in rfce oh david let me just type it hold on david rfce okay my bad so rscv is a shortcut guys when i do this it creates the header component right there and so now if i say header on here okay say header here and here nothing really shows up as you can see correct but but what do i need to do div in that in that case now tell me what do you think you need to import it to your application because right now it's just a component exactly so let's go ahead and import it i'm going to go app.js i will import it so what's going to happen is i will do it like this and i'll do import import guys header i'm going to say dot slash header right there import header header from from header like this like so you guys can see that right there beautiful right so it's going to import now when i say import header from it's going to import this component from where from here which is actually just right here just so you guys know okay just basically from there beautiful and so now what's gonna happen is that dave is gonna type in header as you can see right there you just type in header right there in header box and this is a component it's like a div tag guys right right think of it as a deal tag but it is a component and so now if i go ahead and save this i go back to here and boom right there you have the header let's go that is beautiful okay that is it right there let me go see what you guys are saying whoo let's go let's go import the jsx verbena what's up what's up everyone they're beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful oh beautiful good night everybody love your content thank you so much i appreciate you thank you so much awesome so we got the header component now one thing i'm going to do is go and make some cleanup so i'll go to app.css i like to remove all this stuff we don't need this right here right then i'm going to remove all this stuff right here don't need this and what i like to add is i like to do margin zero so margins here so what is margin david tell me it's basically um so as you guys could see it everything was centered in the in the very center and we just removed all the all the styling now in terms of margin that's um little something on the very side and it's just a few uh pixels usually now it's going to be zeroed out so basically everything that you put into your application is going to be snapped to the side of your window beautiful exactly so it's not on the side of the window beautiful which is exactly what so now you can see here header now you see this right here it's now to the side of the window as you guys see right there all right beautiful so now because i had a js one thing i want to do is i want to create the css file but actually we're not going to use css for this we're going to use something called style components which is the really cool part okay don't worry about okay what we'll say so on the header what's going to happen if we think about this let's go and now divide up the header here's our amazon clone right there okay what do we have in header well we have a few things all right let's think about this and go rectangle so here's a header here's a header right here beautiful now how do we divide this very simple well we have the logo right we had the say hello address okay we have the search bar we have what we have the hello nazari account list and then what else do we have what else do we have tell me huh and then we also have the returns orders and then we have a card section right there you see guys so by having these specific components we now know what to create so let's think of this i'm going to keep this on here so let's go and do this um david let's create the first component which is the name should be let's go ahead and name the component uh what should we call this the component huh tell me let's do header logo component okay so let's create a component called header logo yes uh do we want to introduce start components right now yes so what's gonna happen is check this out guys instead of doing this what i will do is i will say header logo header logo like this okay boom right there so what is this it's like a div right here of course but it's really nothing so far until we import style components and to import style components what i want you guys to do is let's go ahead and do plus on the terminal here and let's go ahead and do and it will do what do npm install style dash components right there oh nentz beautiful components so let's go and install that what those are is you're like you're styling a component in javascript so instead of having to put into a css file you're going to put into a javascript file okay just so you guys know beautiful all right so that's let me see stock opponents is not in the npr just let me see let me go and take a look make sure what is it though npm components right components right there just to make sure what is the name of that of that npm package and pm right there oh right there beautiful stylish components come on open it up beautiful let's go ahead so we got that look at that 2 million weekly almost 3 million look at download that's insane that is insane it's using it right industry standard right here what's up industries industry standard right there so i'm gonna copy this specific thing i'm gonna copy this one uh sure that's fine david that's fine you want to read my terminal that's fine let me see style component it's all right beautiful so it looks like it's downloading now is it yeah right there so stock components have officially been installed which is amazing and now what we do at this point is we need to import style components so i'm going to say inside here i'm going to say import styled right there i'm going to open up this boom boom import from from what styled styled dash components opponents beautiful styles components so import that we imported the package guys that means we can now use it for those of you who are completely new with this stuff okay so now to use it here's what we're going to do i'm going to say const header logo right header logo logo is equal to what david style dot style dot div look at this you see style dot dip so this basically created a component we don't need to do like this even right but of course this basically is now like a div okay so header logo check this out and if i go back to my react app you can see that if i go ahead and save this okay and if i refresh this still nothing is there but check this out okay because if i go to header let's let's say header i'm going to give this header let's say a height of 60 pixels of 60 pixels okay let me see 60 pixels 160 pixels beautiful and now i'm going to also give it a what a uh let's say background color you guys ready for this are you ready for this bro you better be ready background color i'm gonna give this color right here make sure you guys copy this on your own okay background color boom right there so i'm going to save this right here all right oh would you look at that you see would you look at that so here's what happens right we have the style component right this is the amazon logo which is oh should let me go ahead and do it like this let me go brush so right there this is this portion right here you see this header logo so now dave is going to create the next one which is going to be which one what is the next one david is going to be header option address correct so let's create the header option address yes right here so this one is going to be the header option address he's going to create another component right there beautiful and make sure i go ahead and delete that a little bit so yeah header option address and he's gonna also create a component in here right there i see beautiful nice nice nice nice nice and we are at 328 likes let's go beautiful guys and we got five almost i guess 500 people 500 people in this live video all learning how to do you know pretty much everything how about an amazon clone guys because every as you guys know guys make sure to smash that like button and share this with everybody because the more this video gets out right the more we get to teach and the better it is the cover community and everything so smash let them help us destroy this not destroy but smash help us with the youtube algorithm and so forth and we'll be all good all right all right let's continue on all right let's get to 400 likes guys yeah exactly all right what is the name what's up so we we got the header option address that's basically one of the uh pieces right there next to it good good good good what we can do is actually i have uh what's up this is the pin over here and i can just put it right in there oh what is this snipping hot tell me so basically this is uh these are two span tags with their specific class names and it's just uh it's just saying the word hello on the top and the one down below is saying select your address it's basically the the little piece if you go to amazon.com you will see the exact same stuff exactly so kind of like when you do hellos like your as you can see right and so we can do these are here guys oh and we have another donation let me see let me see let me see now donation hey let's go thank you so much just love the videos thank you so much akito appreciate it chf2 what is that i'm not really sure what that is oh uh that's that's swiss right yeah i'm not really sure that is but guys check this out so what's going to happen is this hello is a span tag and we're going to convert this into an actual style component so what we're going to do is this option line one i'm going to say here const option line one right line that far okay option line one yes i want to go that far equals style.div okay right there beautiful style.div and and then so forth i'm going to we're going to add a style in a second here and then we'll do const option what is it line two option line two right there is equal to also style that div style dot div right there that div okay so and that's also gonna be where we put the css and so forth so we can that we got these four components at this point right here and you can see david right here is create them into components so option line one option line two inside the header option address okay beautiful beautiful beautiful so what's gonna happen now at this point is we need to style them but let's see what we've got so far all right so it says style is not defined i think it's because they probably spell the wrong style style is not defined there we go style is not put it in past tense oh man grammar bro style come on save it okay ops and line watch so style's not defined let me go hey there we go beautiful beautiful right there so it says hello it's like your address now okay now the one thing you have to think about is you see this header logo this header logo is basically the logo now we definitely technically we should have put this height on the not the logo but technically we should put this on the on the actual container yeah there we go the header level right thank you so we'll do basically i just uh deleted the div from here yes yes yes yes and then i'm just going to go ahead and create a new style component so instead of doing div we do create a header the reason why is because this will allow us to add the css with style components all right beautiful so let's go ahead and add that there i can just paste it in here where i have it right there beautiful right there you go ahead awesome sweet sweet so it's going to save this all right and what do we have so far it says does some error it's okay if you refresh this no problem const header style dot do oh we can't we have to do we have to make a container bro container like this you cannot just call it like that there you go oh really because the class name is the header that's why there we go see look at that i know you can't see anything on here right it says hello select your eyes that's the only thing you can see but that's pretty much it so next thing i want to do is after the option solid address let's go and actually add the logo in here okay and the logo is what is just an image source so i'm gonna do image here so let me go and do this part now so we'll do image image right here image source is equal to something don't worry about that just yet okay and we're gonna close it out now right there now the image source is i mean it's an image right so the image that we have here is actually right there let me go ahead and get this image for you i'm going to give it i have this image logo which is actually here i will put this for you guys in the comments so you guys can have it okay beautiful this is the image you see there's the amazon logo image so let's go ahead and do that i'm gonna paste it into here i'm gonna make it as a string boom right there and done so save that all right amazing oh let's go david if you can go ahead and copy that image url this imagery the people that's already in the comments guys you're the best bro you're the best you're the best awesome we're gonna put it to facebook yeah well that's that's that's in a second here so so now let's think about this okay we have this logo here right and then what else do we have well we have the logo here and now we have the hello select your edges we now need to put them side by side okay now how do we do that right because we look when we look at this right i mean this is side by side correct side by side right so what we do is we use something called display flex all right display flex so what's going to happen is i'm going to go the container and i will say display display flex on the container so save that okay uh let's see what happens now okay so nothing happens at this point okay right now we're going to do is what what he's doing what david is doing is doing a line item center to center everything vertically and if i go ahead and save this to make sure and then he's going to just justify content center don't worry about that don't worry don't worry about the justification just yet okay just do a lineup center for now so you can see the amazon clone is not a line center but it's still horrible guys right why is that akito says my last credit for you guys thank you so much i appreciate you let's go beautiful beautiful beautiful thank you so much that is epic i love you guys uh love so much love for everybody that's always good to hear all right perfect so we got that portion um now let's go focus on the image itself so if we have this header logo right let's focus on the image let's do image we'll do image and on the image what i want to do is well technically a few things i'm going to give it a width of 100 100 pixels what 100 pixels right there there and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to give it what well nothing because look if i give it a width of 100 pixels that's it look at this guys this is done you see this right here the amazon logo only has a 100 pixels the height will change automatically and so it's no longer a hideous amazon logo that's over on everything that we don't need you know what i mean but boom it's all done right there one thing i'm gonna do is i'm gonna give some margin to us i'm gonna say margin left margin left 11 pixels right there so save that module i like pixels and so that get adds some space so now just so you know guys so you guys know what is margin well margin is very simple right if i go ahead and do this right here if this is the container right the margin is a space right there is a space right here boom right little space on the side it's a space you know on the side it's like almost like for example if you have i don't know let's just have a piece of paper let's just say this right you guys got a piece of paper okay the margin is this space okay it's the space right there same thing here it's a space here right it's a space here the patty on the other hand that's a space inside that's so called padding guys just so you know all right beautiful so i know that's some that's my way of explaining things sometimes you know it's using some visuals so let's go ahead and do this all right we've got the amazon logo that's great we've got the header option address what is next david huh what do you think uh so next i would actually add a color of white on the container level just so we actually see what the text is let's see it let's see it color white nice i think it's a i think it's a good idea to to actually see what we're doing i know i know right only sometimes hey there we go beautiful now i would actually continue not caring about a second and just laying out the whole structure of the component how about that okay that's fine that's fine that's fine so okay so let's continue laying out the structure so we have the header option address right here next one we're going to work on is going to be the the input container which is uh let me go and do this so i'm gonna while he's typing this is the one right here so he's going to create the header search right there as you guys can see right so that one's gonna be very simple their search is just simply what right there put uh with with actually an icon at the very end correct correct let's impose an icon right there okay next one we're going to do is what well the one we're going to work on is going to be this hello account nozadi's list that's going to be a good one to work on um so let's go on i know i know i know it's funny i know i know i know you gotta have fun with it man you know it's just you know it's about having some fun oh yeah you have to oh sure yeah yeah exactly so we got the input there we go so for an actual let me let me blow some minds here because so far we have only only done style.div but right now are you ready i'm gonna do you guys you guys have your mind blown get ready guys all right go ahead now i'm to do styled the input right there look at that basically he's creating a component right there and he's doing style dot input guys how cool is that natalia's like smile david i'm smiling come on it's the second time i got it look guys you smile you see that he's smiling trust me display flex good good good guy over here i'm just a little slow now oh my gosh awesome sweet guys you guys are amazing so many amazing comments guys keep keep it keep it going keep it going all right guys so cool all right so you see inside do style.div we just created an input container an input box right just using this and if i go ahead and save this let's take a look right there right and find smackdown on this one guys look at this i'm going to remove us here from a little bit if i go on this i think action already bro it's done that's it before the amazon thank you so much for watching guys have yourself i'm just kidding all right so you see this input right there look that was this one right here guys look at this guys this input right here that's in the actual uh browser right that was uh rendered boom that's the one right there that's what we just created right that's the input guys just so you know very simple very simple all right beautiful all right go ahead continue all right beautiful amazing amazing awesome so next up right what's going to happen well a few simple things so we got the input what's the next one after that one going to be which is the hello account as ours list what can we do for that one david huh tell me uh before we do that we will need to add another thing it's going to be just an icon okay which icon it's a part of the header search okay let's do that right now header whoa we are at 452 likes you guys are the best that's all i can say to you beautiful all right sweet sweet sweet so had a search container right there and so the icon that he's working on is very simple he's working on this icon right here header search icon container right so it's going to be orange and then it's going to have an icon inside so now let's think about though the big question is how do we get this icon how do we get this icon david huh all right for that we should be using material ui yes yes so check this out guys we use material ui icons material ui icons right there beautiful sweet sweet sweet it's basically a completely free icon set provided by google open source i'm not sure if it's open source but you can use it you can use the problem so it's open source so i can click search for example i can type in search and hopefully it gives me search come on all right doesn't like doesn't want to give me a search unless google is broken or something there you go you see so i got the search these are all the search icons i have in front of me here and so i click on by the way it tells me how do we go ahead and get it so i'm going to go ahead and copy this right here boom i'm going to import it on my side of the code okay good so we just copied that icon okay now of course we still don't have access to this guys because why we need to also now install it so you can see david here what's he doing here well he's installing it right there right there you see that right there he's installing npm user ui install npm material ui core and also install material ui icons right so two things two things guys two things thus let's see what we do let's see how this works good good good good good good good so we got that all right we got this let's install the immature ui core guys make sure to pay attention for the order first you have to install the core then you can install the icons okay because the icon is built on top of the core good awesome all right so that's perfect we've got that specific portion so now if we're going to use this you see now we can actually use the search icon and to use it all i gotta do is just type it in like this it's just like a component right there you see yeah it's actually a component david you're so fast at this i just don't understand what it did all right one thing we're saying here is a header search container is not defined the reason why is because we need to go ahead and create the component so i will say const i see a num faster than david header header search [Laughter] search container this one okay container right there is equal to what styled dots there we go gotta save that let's go it still says not defined probably because i've misspelled it header search container let me see here's a container right there uh come on come on do us do with me there we go icon container that's the one now so check this out you can see this you see how this icon is right here again we can fix that by using what something called display flex okay so header search is right here and so what we will do is we'll go to header search which is where is it right there we'll see display flex on this one good save that and boom right there you got yourself that thing that you wanted the whole time okay it's as easy as that guys all right after that guys what's gonna happen is we've got the logo let's go and continue on and continue building that structure okay what's next exactly so next up we got the header knob items good and those are gonna be like everything else on the right hand side so if you can uh take a look if you can show us the finished product yes right there um it's going to be everything from hello nazari account list something that returns and orders and even the card icon with the number okay right there returns orders and the card icon right there beautiful yes yes yes yes yes yes cool all right um so for that uh we're gonna be just creating a brand new um style.div which is gonna be header um nav items never items yep that's another style component and this is going to contain what this one's going to contain all these things things okay so we're going to have the header option one that's the one well you can use the same one option line one option line two right no no that's going to be inside of this one because we have the hello and azari it should be the same should the same okay fine fine fine david fine fine fine fine then you have option line one option line two exactly got it okay okay all right so again what's going on here guys right so we have the header nav item so just so you know okay we have the header nav items right here okay basically they had enough items and then the way we're going to connect this is this portion the hello account azaris that could be header option and then this is also going to be a header option right here right there right there you see we have option line one that's gonna be hello account azaris which is going to be here so if we go ahead and check this out let's go ahead and do hello hola so hello comma comma good good go sorry and then the last one's gonna be what hello account and list good and finally the last time from here is going to be returns so let's go and type in returns guys returns good good right there right there good right there so you can see what we just did right we create these components header option header option right both of both of these are header options right here okay that's gonna be the header nav items and i think the last one that we have to that one is gonna be the header option cart okay that is correct yes yes so let me go ahead and actually type that one out let me type that one out option yeah i'll do that sorry yeah it's faster okay oh i see how it is okay you can take it over from here you can take it so header option card there's a few things that i had an option card which is going to be guys this one right there okay just so you know header option card now for the header option card a few things need to create number one the card itself number two is the number correct so let's try that so the first one is going to be the card i'm going to go to the material icons let's go and start searching cart cart let's see right there this is a good one you see the shopping basket i kind of like that one it's going to copy this one go to copy the shopping basket go back to our thing it's going to import it here voila boom that gives us that that's awesome good good good good good and so now if you look at our thing holy shmack money guacamole holy guacamole so many things that we have do are not defined guys okay so many things but again it is completely completely okay hey all right superb guys good good good good good good good so so the first thing to do is go ahead let's go ahead and all these things said undefined let's create them so you can see he's already on it so we have header option which is not defined next we're going to create is the header nav items right there good oh yeah good good good that's going to create the hand items david yes so constant high enough items nice and then the header option cart right there okay we got that already got that all right so we've created these styles of this and they're empty i mean they're not i mean they they and so we have a low account list and returns and notice now again horrible horrible thing right how do we go ahead and now put these to be alongside well we use the display flags to put them outside so just remember just memorize that if you want something side by side then flex side it does that make sense flex excited [Laughter] you just came up with this right yeah the display flex it how about that oh yeah exactly so display flex save that you just save it you just need to save it let's go there we go beautiful all right for the i had an option card let's go and actually use this shopping bask icon shopping shopping basket icon i will place that into here right there okay so we got the basket icon right there and now let's go ahead and get the the actual card count so i'm going to create a new component called card account card count right there boom that's like this boom card count and let's say for now i'm going to put a placeholder that's going to say for example five four for just just four for now so let's go down to here let's go to const const cart count is equal to style.diff right oh come on it's right there you guys okay good good good sometimes i know i know i know so now a lot of things have happened here at this point you can see we've got the pretty much the fundamental of this header okay now one thing to do is let's go and style this hello nazari and accounts list right there to be more like the way it should be okay so let's check it out well for the uh the actual header option line one uh well line two this line two we need to actually make that into a font weight of 700 so let's go ahead and go to do option line two let's go ahead and do this font wait wait wait wait wait you like that that thing when you go to you press the button says wait not talking about no oh [ __ ] okay never mind [Laughter] all right so there you go you see now this right here is more has more weight on it so does this is more bold and so is this more bold now one thing i'll be asking okay so now is how do we go ahead and actually space this out spaces out properly well how do we space these things out properly well here's what we can do on the container you see those items align items guys just so you know that centers it vertically okay now justify content centers it horizontally but there's different methods to it if i go to flexbox flexbox for example okay xbox oh damn david just already gave it the answer holy moly ah it's nothing okay so flexbox you see this needs to be your friend your best friend in the world okay here's why because this is going to explain how flexbox works so you can see you have a container right there and these are the children these are the div items and we can number one we can put them in horizontal or vertical fashion if i wanted to or if i for example i want to wrap them and then look at this look at this check this out you see there's justified content i can space them out evenly i can space them out in between i can center them if i wanted to flex and like start pretty much anything i want understood good now this is the vertical alignment align items right there flex start flex end center stretch and so forth as you can see beautiful so we can use that now guys okay let's use that let's go ahead and go to here and we'll say justify content justify content content what space between space between basically what it's gonna do it's gonna make sure that the space between the children is equal exactly so if i go to amazon oh would you look at that okay would you look at that so exactly that's awesome right that is amazing so beautiful so now let's think about this okay now let's think about the um let me think about that i mean do it for uh nav items as well yeah i'll do it for nav items too so for the net but i mean i don't want like for me for these ones these ones we just need to add them proper padding for these ones so let's go now to the header where is it nav items now i love these ones so guys what do you guys think if we want to go ahead let me know in the comments below if i want to go ahead and add spacing right in between these specific things what do you think we need to do tell me what do you think is something we need to do huh you guys tell me put in the comments below okay i'm very curious what you know okay for what you learned so far well for these ones the header option kind of the header option well a few things we're gonna do padding for these ones okay let me go to header option right here right there again remember header option are these specific divs okay so for the header option let's do padding padding uh what should we do patterning left playing left nine pixels left nine pixels beautiful padding left nine pixels and then after that what's going to happen is what is that's gonna give it some padding lat nine pixels then we'll do padding uh putting right nine pixels heading right right nine pixels good good good good good good and then what's gonna happen padding top panning this top is gonna be which one good padding top is what 10 pixels good and then finally penny bottom bottom 10 pixels oh let's go oh not one pixel 10 pixels not even trouble huh come on i know hold on hold your horses man i know you want to do the trouble thing so check this out now guys you see how we just add a penny right there and let me see what you guys said because i think a lot of you guys have said the right answer let me see a lot of you guys said the right answer on the whole common stuff go let me see let me see learning so much for now thank you that's amazing i'm that's i'm pumped good padding somebody said could you do 10 pixels yes good cuttings that's a good one too that's a good one too i like that one so padding heading left tell you need space that's a funny one hold your horses hey sheila oh that's funny padding good good good guys good job good job so now let's think about this so we got that portion now we can convert this side guys to actually something shorter it's called trouble look at this i want you to pay attention to this really quickly okay i'm gonna increase the size of this even bigger now padding look at this padding and check this out i want you trouble top so i want you to memorize this specific word right so i'm gonna say trouble trouble right there okay now what does this mean is very simple ah [ __ ] hold on trouble right there okay all right so what does this mean it's very simple guys if you want to think about this so go ahead uh so add the amount of padding for this david go ahead and do it do it from there do it with me right there let's do it so 10 pixels so 10 this can be stand for top you see then this right here is going to stand for right that's the right side good this trouble then b it's going to stand for bottom good and then the last one this is going to be left that's going to say for our left right there so trouble top right bottom left right top right bottom left right and you can replace all of this just using this short hand really nicely guys you see that yes or no really really nice really good really cool right and so now i can remove all this stuff boom voila oh look at that guys cheeky picky and then we're all good huh yeah am i right oh 522 likes guys let's get to 600. can we get this 600 likes i'll know you guys can do it let's go let's go all right beautiful i did it can you go ahead and continue coding and what are we going to do work on next and actually that's going to work on this input this let's work on this specific import okay i like that this one you see the search box that's working down right now yes all right so the storage uh we will need to first fix how the uh header search as a div looks like right where are we at okay there we go good good good continue continue on okay here we go god now heather search we want to make sure that it uses as much space as it possibly gets some water can what's up i'm gonna get some water oh yeah okay so um so for the heather search we want to make sure that it uses all the space that it actually has so for that we will be saying flex dash grow mmhmm meaning grow as much as possible okay think about it as like for example you know let's say like like let's say this is taking up space you see this thing that's taking on space right if i want to grow as much as possible i say flex grow one so it's gonna be as big as possible like this big you know what i mean that's gonna be flag scroll one okay all right exactly all right and um it's just gonna use like it's gonna stretch out all the way but it's only gonna be the container for now correct because the container guys you can see is this one right there that's the container right which is this so if you see it's stretching as much as i can and that's the container guys okay exactly good that's gonna continue on now for the we we obviously want to make sure that the actual input is going to do the exact same so let's see how it looks like up here so we got the uh header search input okay good good component and we want to make sure that that takes up as much space as it can as well so we will do flex grow one in there too and if i save it from here it might not go oops there we go okay so hopefully you guys can actually see that uh on the top top of the screen it actually shrinked all the way till the very end and now even the search box search uh input box is actually uh using all the space it can now next up um because we already have the display facts we just want to make sure that it is uh the right beautiful look at that you see that this input is fully growing right there beautiful and then that's awesome so that's gonna be flex curl one so again guys let's go one it's actually defined here inside inside flexbox as you can see let me see let me go back to here see if like shrink and then flex curl right there you see so for example this two is a flex girl one right here okay that's going to grow more than anything else that's what you guys need to understand all right good uh let's go ahead and continue on all right cool um so what we will do next up is we want to make sure that the uh the uh container is 40 pixels high so we're just gonna say height of 40 pixels um let me save it nice beautiful okay that's much better much better right yeah so much better and uh we want to give it a border radius of four pixels so it's just going to um make a circular and a border radius guys that's sharp in your border is it can you see if i go ahead and zoom in on here you see how so sharp it's like it's like edgy i don't like it right so a border base is gonna make it basically smooth it's gonna be smooth so let's go ahead and do this what so look at that it's still not fully smooth for a certain so for the suga let's go ahead and do for the border because that's because i forgot to put the pigs there but now it should be smooth now it's still not going to be smooth actually yeah no it's not there's there's a reason why but don't worry about that we'll talk about that in a second here why it's not smooth but i want you to what i want us to work on actually now david is let's work on this search box you see this search container so header search icon container because down has a very very special styling for that one all right so let's work on that one right now where did i lose it there we go i lost it here ah come on good so and for this one it's going to be very simple in the header search container what we want to do guys is is kind of the following okay header search eye container well we'll want let's go do let's go to add okay fine let's back on color that's fine that's good that's good background color is going to be this orange color so f e b d bd69 so let's go ahead and save this good all right awesome next thing we're going to do is we'll go ahead and give it a width color and i'll do width nice good good good so width of 45 pixels all right to give it a width right here okay okay with the 45 pixels right there and then the last thing we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and give it a what well a few things let's go get go and give it a color of black that's correct yeah yes so what what does all this mean guys so let's go ahead and say this refresh this so what does all this mean so you guys know all right so here's the amazon clone right there no problem few things we just gave it this little box it has orange it has an orange what's oh what happened here it's interesting color black ah we just didn't save it there we go awesome so what kind of happened happened here let me kind of stop stop sharing from you all right okay good the thing that happened here is a few things while we create this box no problem okay and then we give it a background color with the width and the color black now we need to center it so we'll do what guys what do you guys think put in the comments what do you think we need to do to center this well very simple justify content justify oh display flexes first display flex okay flex is our savior of the day you know it justify content there's content center okay bomb right there so look you see now right away it's centered right away this specific portion is centered horizontally if you want to center it now vertically what do we do guys put in the comments below what do you guys think all right well it's going to be align items align items dash center save that boom right there guys you can laugh all you want but i don't care okay don't matter because we're here to have fun and enjoy and learn that's the most important part guys as you guys can see we're currently at 400 people 573 likes can we get to 600 likes guys you will be amazing if we can get to that that would be awesome stop here for a second and just and do what david i don't hear you so let's just stop here for a second while everybody is smashing that like button for that youtube algorithm and it gets to 600. exactly if you guys have any questions let's go ahead take a look at what people are saying right now what do we guys have well there we go 600 come on monet says there we go like like everybody 5.75 let me say sir hire me you know i mean you know who never knows now 5.93 let's go a bunch of love hey let's go 600 come on come on come on oh finally seven adrienne says let's go adrienne yes can we get to 600 yeah beautiful 600 natalya let's go whoo that's what i'm talking about guys that is how we do it here beautiful you guys are always rocking you so a few things i want you guys now to do let's go ahead and continue on okay we're not done yet and we're not done anywhere we're not close to it yet so you see look now let's take a look at this border radius remember how did this border radius here and the header search right there well check this out the reason why the border race is not fully there is a following reason if i right click and spec dump on this one let's go and take a look at this where is it where's our header search well it's pretty much here this is the header search and if we go and take a look at the css applied to it border radius okay you see that right there it's border with four pixels right there that's the one okay beautiful it's not applied because of overflow look at this if i do overflow hidden oh uhhuh yeah yeah that's what i thought exactly boom you can see that right there this is a much better now circular you see it actually has a nice concave shape to it now that's exactly what we want okay so we got that portion that's just good let's finish up with that with this input box which look which needs a little bit of fixing which what are some things that you need to need to tell me david so definitely a fix that we we we can't just miss and it just bugs my eyes for the last i don't know how many minutes that we have that go ahead but what i definitely want to do is making sure that it doesn't light up in the glue when you click inside right okay go ahead so what i want to do is i want to type in focus uh with a column okay so basically on the focus of this input so when i say focus it means when i click on this you see when i click on this right there see how there's this blue hideous box the way we know that it has blues is hideous box because if i do focus on this and if i do for example if i right click on this and i do four state focus you can see right there and i go to here you can see this is there's this hideous outline right there you see this in the right there where is it where is it where is it right there in the before state again put four state it's a hideous outline that's this it's just so ugh look at this horrible right so what we do is we say focus outline none which will remove that portion and so now when i go ahead and refresh this since i save this here boom beautiful it's exactly what i want so much better so so much better okay next up next i want to do is let's go ahead and do the following thing which is got the flex girl one that's awesome what is this weird trickery going on here do you see what i mean with this you know there's like space in between the the header search container and everything like that do you see that right there it's weird right here you see this right here there's like something going on i'm not sure what it is but it's something going on it's really odd i'm not sure what it is exactly exactly sure what you're showing but let me see probably there oh yeah that way let's see input let me see margin zero that's fine let's girl one which is fine that's all good i like that okay so maybe you don't need to focus too much on it because i don't want to focus too much on it on this specific portion instead i want to focus on the other stuff which is i want to go ahead and focus away because there's this div right here too color black which is good that's all right yeah div should be the icon so i mean this search icon thingy because no it's fine yeah yeah that's fine so i think the nice thing to focus on is let's go to add some spacing around these specific portions okay so this portion and so forth so for the hello select your address let's go back to here where is it this one right here option line one option line two a few things we need to create here on the hello select your address which is gonna be what what is it gonna be i mean you definitely uh add a little margin right to the header option address good good good go that way that way we don't have to worry about the rows then uh themselves um so i'm not sure if you want to scroll down or not all right one thing i want to do for the okay so a few things i want to do i want to go ahead for the option address right here this option address i here's a really cool thing i can do command click on this and this watch should take me straight to it you see this button before look at this i know cool right now i have to scroll down yeah i know i know chicory stuff huh so command click or control click on it for example if you're on windows so i can do for example padding for this one i will say padding left left let's go ahead and do 9 pixels so you actually kind of move it a little bit more to where i want it to be okay good all right that's awesome so that's more padding and i want to add more padding as well to the the header search itself too i think that's going to going to be really really important okay so on that specific portion let's go ahead and do also let's go to header where is it i'm going to close this out and we'll do do a header where's the header search where is it where's the rest of the header search there we go so command click on the header search right there beautiful and then what i will do in this case is pretty simple is i will go ahead and do padding left five pixels yeah actually no yeah let's do that let's do i mean yeah you can add like horizontal padding margin left margin left yes left four pixels right there okay good all right sweet that's so much better one thing what to do now is we want to go and add this this icon right there you guys see that right there so it's gonna add this icon it's it's called a map icon and now to do that it's very simple oh look this looks so good look at this nice all right let's go ahead and add the icon right there so it's called a location icon i think location beautiful let me see there we go location on is that the one we want to use yeah yep that's right all right so i'm going to go ahead and copy this once right there beautiful i'll go back to here close this one out and i'll import that one here as well beautiful and that will be it right there good so we have this specific portion no problem whatsoever and that looks good all beautiful guys all right so let's go ahead and get this let's go and see where we're at all right let me refresh all good now let's think about where do we put that header thing well a few simple places that goes directly into into the search uh no no no into the option address so right there location on option line one option line two but we need to go ahead and maybe you definitely need to wrap this up into a header option i had a route to header option beautiful then let's go ahead and get whatever we have here good thank you david awesome thank you all right sweet sweet sweet good god that portion command save all right so now again hideous thing what's going on here right because you can see this this logo and it's on top of each other to fix that it's a very simple job all i gotta do command click on header option address and again guys how do you go ahead and make them align horizontally drop it in the comments drop the comments you guys should be knowing it but you guys should know at this point guys it's very very simple and it is our saver display flex display flex let's go and save that oh right there beautiful so hello select address here is there one thing i want to do is let's go align the center so we'll do vertically so we'll say align what items center save that good hello oh look at this this looks so good so good so good okay so that looks amazing that looks awesome one thing you need to fix that's there let's go and fix now this hideous thing right there you see this icon right there which is the which one oh yeah yeah the option which is the card yeah if we go to option card guys that's going to click command click on that one that gives us to the style all right a good now the style again how do you line it horizontally right very simple what is it display flex it's always display facts that's always the answer okay just so you know always sometimes it's display great always the answer all right let's go vertically line it's going to be aligned item center i got it david i got it faster i got it faster no i think i got it faster since last year all right awesome sweet sweet sweet now let's go ahead and add some padding to it i'm going to go ahead and do the option cart i'm going to give it some padding let's go padding what are you going to give what pad i'm going to give i'm padding left right left no okay i'm heading right actually we can do all kinds of paddings because you want to give it a room to breathe on the right hand side yeah so let's do padding right let's do padding right right here is going to be what uh let's do it nine pixels nine pixels on this one good nine pixels so that's going to give some real and let's go now add some padding as well well left i think they already have putty don't doesn't it maybe i'm wrong um maybe i just don't see it right okay that's so good yeah i don't know i know so we got the padding left padding right that's amazing good good good good now so that's good now let's add some padding in between these items right here guys okay so let's go and check this part out so to do that i'm going to go ahead and exit out of this and the card count i will do command click on the card count and there i'm going to add some maybe no some style to this one so boom boom boom boom right there and that one's going to be what well uh padding what is it painting left this display grid would have just like sold all your problems no i will not good all right so i like that portion one thing i want to add is when i go and click on this you see i have this is oh well not sure what happened there um i wanna i wanna go ahead and click on this specific portion right here you see has that origin box which just looks so cool uh we can make that too as well let's go ahead and do that let's go ahead and do it on here the way that that works guys it's very simple if i go to the head that css uh if i go to the header here what where is our header well it's very simple it's the header search which is right here a header search cont no header search okay to add that i want you to look at this okay this is really cool really cool let me go and find it where where i usually have it but because okay so the way this works is the following i do focus within look at this i can do focus within so here on the header search i say focus with a mini if i anything that's on focus on the inside of it i will do the following i will do box shadow look at this guys a box shadow boom right there nope this is focused it's cool right it's so cool all right i'm also going to give it a background color of white let's see a background color of white okay back ground around let's see background color of white good i like it and then uh i think that's pretty much it on the side of the actual you know input stuff and i'm going to also for the border now that's good all right so let's go ahead and save that all right oh look at that look at this that looks so good and now and then you see how there's this weird thing going on with this border and i'm like oh my god i don't get it but that's okay because it all it's it's a very simple fix i go to here header search input and then here all is just border zero boom right there problem solved indeed and we are back in business guys we're back in business all right so so far what do we have what do you have so far guys who's pumped still with me guys what do you have support well we have the amazon right there we have the logo hello select your address we have this we have this we have this and we have that right there everything is there we have the whole header portion figured out and that it to me is pretty damn cool won't you say so right of course yes yeah i would say so pretty much yeah so now ever i know it's so cool so cool let me see where you guys are at so far let me see so let me see your comments so far let me see hey let's go here we go lexi i have votes let's go nicola said so a lot so i said lol i love this guy's energy i'm never this excited when i'm working yes yes somebody said make kazzy store i'm not sure that'd be funny that'd be funny that'd be funny awesome can you offset the box shadow that'd be interesting that'd be good okay let me see good good nice one good hello there hello david i'm thinking oh my god that's funny i like it all right beautiful so let's go ahead and remove some of this this stuff all right so where are we on let me go and take a look at our whole web location here's where we're at guys look at this i will go ahead and make this bigger boom right there this is the whole app it looks pretty sick i would say so huh it looks pretty dope all right there's a whole lab so far we've got a few ways to go so far because we need to get to this portion right so we need to be able to get add this specific portion right here and then we'll add the card what i want to do now is the following let's add the actual cart you'll see why in a second okay so um on the card section let's take a look at this all right now how do we actually do that right how do we go ahead and have a cart that's going to work with us that's a good question well the following if i go to my app.js okay my header is there i can also add a card so i'm going to create a card component i will do a new file and i will say card.js this is going to be our cart page guys card.js okay oh i'll do rfce and rcv rfc is just an extension guys for you to be able to have shortcuts if you don't have the shortcut there's no problem to install the shortcut you have to go to extensions and do es7 react redux right here react redux uh uh what is what it's called components is what i shall call it right yeah actually if you type in es7 it's going this is going to be the first one to shoot react without you uh snippet something there awesome sweet all right what did i just do whatever happened okay there we go good job let's go back to the gs header no contain the header can you can it can you have that good good good i like it all right okay next up i'm going to add the card so i'm going to say cart as well in here david damn it no i'm i'm not even touching it that's so interesting okay good and then what's going to happen is i'm going to import the card so you have this card right here i'm going to save this card go up the gs i'm going to import this card so import cart from damn it no come on good good good good good nice and now we have the card now we don't see anything but that's okay i'll go to cut that gs i'm saying all right there so this is the card now but the question is now how to differentiate this from the home page well it's a few very different things okay we're going to use something called your router i'm going to create another page called home so let's go to source source new file and we'll go ahead and say home.gs right there okay i'm the gs and do rfce good that's going to create the home one and i'm gonna say this is home good let's go back to app.gs awesome and we'll also do home so almost undefined it's gonna import say import home from what from home right there good nice so now we have two pages we have the card page and we also have the home page now how do we if i click on one how do i get to the other one that's going to be a good question well we're going to use something called react router down guys react router dom right there not dom dom right there so in react writer down will allow us to be able to navigate between pages kind of like when you have for example you know facebook you have a news feed page and then you have for example netflix you have you know a page where you have all your movies and then you have a page where you have all the you know an individual movie and so forth well this will allow us to do that and i'm sorry i already loaded it i already typed it in in the terminal thank you so let's go ahead and hold up the terminal how do i do how do i open into a terminal let me see command j let me see sh is it the one right there so you can see dave is going to type it in right there npmi react router dumb let's go to install it beautiful it's basically just and it's actually switching between pages without loading or reloading so you know with normal pages when you click a link it's going to like go super slow and it's just loading and stuff this case boom you're there exactly exactly so the way it works is very simple this for example right here is a link so you can link to different pages and this is the actual route we have a switch and there's we have a route for the about page a route for the users page right and so forth and so forth let me put this up for you so you guys can see it better okay right there right there so we'll do the same thing in our situation as well i'm going to make this just a tad smaller it's a bit too big all right good so in our case here's what we'll do we'll have the header which is always going to be here because the header is something in common that both the about on to the card page and the home page have so what we will do is i will i will now import react router react router dom i will say import here i'm going to say import and check this out guys pay a close attention okay we'll do right here import browser router as router that's the first i'm going to import so i'm going to say boom browser router as router comma switch comma what route comma what link where we import this from from react boom router dash dumb done done so okay kaput good now good mo all right so we're going to follow the same path as they are showing us here which is a switch with with the route okay we're going to follow the same path i will go ahead and do like this we'll say so we'll say switch initially that's correct but before you do that you just have to put the whole thing in a router oh [ __ ] you're right my bad my bad my bad sorry that's all right i got you bro you got me so you have to put the whole thing in the router because you can see here this right here is router right there so good this thank you so much so router good and then we'll do switch case and that's it and then this will now have different routes we'll have one route for the cart so we'll say route here route and the path for this one's gonna be path is gonna be dash cart okay and this will have the card page so we'll say the card component some say cart boom right there the next route is gonna be which one next route is going to be nothing the home page right there's the homepage then there's the cart page and this will have the actual home page i like to call it so home boom boom that's the one okay remove all this stuff and boom shakalaka we got it okay i just do a little bit of spacing good and i want to add that that you always want to make sure that the last one in this case like in a switch like this is always the slash because that's pretty much the full uh the fall back off that's the fallback okay meaning if nothing else works if for example let's say you type in dash about and the route is not there it will go to the homepage so what is the helper somebody asked the homepage guys is this page guys this is the homepage right here the homepage is this page the cart page is this page okay and so we've got how to create those two pages understood comprende comprende good all right comprende comprende awesome so look at this now you see currently we're on the homepage because that's the default page as you can see right only shows home but if i type in cart if i type in cart check this out yeah boom it has the card page now you see that right there it has the clicker page exactly and i can actually now link it i can link the card page to when i go ahead and actually click on the card right here let's go ahead and do that right now right now so i go ahead and go click on the cart where's my card my card is right here my card is where where's my my link my link i'm like mike let's go ahead of that gs right there huh right you definitely where is the import first first you want to import yes so of course the first thing we want to go ahead and do okay you got it okay so let's go ahead and import the link nice the only one we're going to use is just simply the link one we don't need to use this one at this portion at all just the link from three backfire down and then what we will go ahead and do we'll do link two look at this guys i will go here and i will say the following link two nice job so right here already already put in here and the header option card all i will do now at this point and put in here voila done done so that's it and then look at that it looks hideous now thank you so much yes yes so now we just yeah what's up so why okay it's good don't worry we'll fix this so check this out okay this the reason why it looks hideous is the following because when you do a link to a cart it's going to put an a tag you see we before we had an a a div now it's a whole a tag which is completely fine okay all we got to do is for the attack now do display flex and then all we got to do is make it vertically aligned so let's go to actually maybe let's do it this way i'm gonna do a little bit smarter here so i'm gonna say you can link to here i'm gonna say boom link to inside here i'm do it this way okay i think it'll be a lot easier for us this way i think that will still be oh okay good nice good nice nice nice that's a little bit better now it's a little bit better it's not as bad as it was well used to be before but what we do now is on the a so we'll do header option card let's go to header option card which is below somewhere here or is it header option card okay i will say e and then uh here i will say everything display flex boom oh oh you see you didn't believe me i didn't no i did i just didn't know what what your goal was boom look at that okay let's go ahead and do at this point the following we'll do color white for this one so we have to change the color okay right there and again the reason why um what just happened here no use for display flag yeah this one bro display flex now display flex still needs to be on here good good you see right there so the reason why we have to change the color on here guys is because by default the a tag has a weird color i have no idea why but it does okay so what they follow the a tag which is a link tag has that has a really work out so we did remove that and also for that we need to remove the text decoration so say text decoration and the text equation is this underline right here you can see right there you see that's the text decoration right there so do text dash decoration ratio and this could be none bomb voila look at that now look at this if i now go to the home page boom home page if i click on the cart boom we're on the cart page how cool is that huh wait that's not me there we go hey hey oh oh beautiful beautiful we're back in business guys that's what i'm talking about all right so what do you guys think it should be the next portion that we work on okay so you tell me what's the next thing that we should work on how what do you guys think i don't know but we are at 6.99 in terms of likes oh 700 likes let's go beautiful beautiful you guys are always are the best energy is amazing look at this energy guys so good so good so good sam you said the hero section exactly that's exactly what we're going to work on now petra says the banner yes sami said media queries not just yet that's will come later 700 mayan beautiful special things the best nas san andreas 706 likes at this point 717 guys what are you guys doing to this you guys are like smash the like button too much they're like you know which is good i guess that's good oh my god everybody was asking about the song i attacked it yesterday oh someone said hello from levive what is up man yaksprave i am not from leave but i've been to and i love it i like to travel there i love i love you i mean i'm from ukraine that's where i'm from so that's amazing wow wow wow that's cool nice job all right natalia attack segregation a little bit late with that but that's okay all right so what's up the next one how do you tell me let me say love from bingo dash that's amazing beautiful okay cool up next we want to go ahead and work on is what well preview all right let's work on the banner section how how long we have how long we have about we have about 30 minutes guys to fully to still finish up the banner section the next part we're going to work on is going to be uh well this portion right here the banner portion okay so stream music for free and so forth so let's go ahead and do that and where is that going to be tell me david it's going to be in the home.js file if i am correct right correct yes it is going to be in the home.js file all right if we go to home.js file which is right here okay a few things let's convert this to a container container because we're going to use components as always container yeah while you do that i'm just going to be importing the solder component silently so here's important to style the components right and right there beautiful so container container container awesome save this uh for some reasons give yelling me for some reason what are you doing let's let's redo the whole thing huh we're still at the beginning what's happening here i'm not sure oh that's okay i'm not sure either container i got this bro hold on chill out we'll go we'll be good it'll be good hi all right yeah okay no container that's fine div i likes nothing ah that's fine rfc is the new way what i'm saying like we are at the very beginning of the okay i think he has to start with some of the use code honestly there you go microsoft product yeah oh come on bro no i didn't say anything all right so cool so let's go into const container let's go ahead and create the style component guys you could do style.div okay okay good good good good nice stella there again this is a component guys okay and this container is gonna not don't worry about that yes so much but this will have two things one is gonna be the home banner right there so let's go ahead and do a one for a home banner okay so we'll say home actually just do banner so do banner like this okay let's give you the banner and then the last one is going to be the content okay that's going to be the content of the home so the content is going to be actually what it's going to be these portions so anything that's in here and that is considered something like content understood comprende good so i'm going to say content underneath this one good oh look at this that looks so cool i'm not sure what is that what that is but that's okay so content now the banner is gonna be very simple guys we need to make that banner into a much better form all right so for the banner well the banner you can see it has a background image and let's take a look at how do we actually do it if i go ahead and go to the banner and i do style.div let's see i'm going to say background image background image is something i'm not really sure what but it's going to be this portion right here so let me see style background image it's going to be this url which i have provided for you right there beautiful right there okay let's go and save this good good good good i can you gonna copy this and paste it in for for everybody to see of course god beautiful good good good nice nice nice background image good so that's gonna be the background image of this specific content and let's also now go ahead and give this one a uh you know we need to give it a minimum height so i'm going to say minimum height so min height min height of 600 pixels david can you not highlight this please david you're not highlighting highlight yeah don't highlight it good thank you all right mini height and then let's see what happens now if i go ahead and go to helm banner let's see what happens now container is not refined well because it's not contains container there we go god god that's a typo i know it's fine we all have typos it's okay not the end of the world it's all good it's all good right so nothing's going on so far right you have many height of 600 pixels but because of what it actually shouldn't be in the content it should be where guys hopefully got that it should be on the banner that was a test for you not for me i didn't even realize i failed that test oh that's funny right we also made this background image in a bad way this should be url like so okay god and so we're gonna put that ah short url i'm gonna give it like this bomb right there god nice look at that beautiful so we've got something along the lines 743 likes holy [ __ ] guys can we get to a thousand let's put let's say that let's do it to a thousand thousand i mean we have 335 people live so if everybody smashes in we should be good if everybody smash that like button like crazy that would be great so yeah main height of oh look at this 600 pixels look at that it's looking starting to look so so much better one thing i want to fix now is the following is the positioning of this background as you can see it's way too big right it's way too big not something i will like like to use right well that's why david here is doing background position position right there that's centered that's gonna center it right there it's gonna center it horizontally and then he's gonna do background size cover now what does that mean let's go into so it's super uh super quickly background position is the position of the background so if it's center basically it makes sure that the background images center is going to be centered god god god god good now here is the cool part okay now listen up all right how do we go ahead right we've got this portion look at that i mean it looks pretty cool it's centered right it's all amazing right no problem whatsoever yeah the cover we didn't explain the cover we'll cover oh yes the cover thank you so much cover it's just make sure that it adapts no matter how big the window of the browser is it's going to be the it's going to like fill out the whole thing yeah so if i go back outside cover right there only give you just a few different uh ways you see so there's contain that there's cover which cover basically will take up as much space as it needs as it possibly can to fill up the whole diff so cover basically will always always fill up the div that's the big difference then we have back on contain that's going to basically make sure that the height because can and the width is contained within that div as well right so that's contained right there all right and that's pretty much the big difference honestly now now here's a question for you you see how we have this like um what's it called this you see how behind this there's like a it's a gradient how do we do that man we need to introduce something called linear gradient now that's actually not something uh that's super easy to type out but in this case we can actually do that yeah so look at this i mean i'm gonna copy paste this actually so they can see it so it's um i don't wanna i wanna confuse you guys too much but it's a linear gradient that's going to go from top to bottom and it's going to go look at this it's going to go from right here from black to white you see from black to well no this is still from um from fully black right here right there oh yeah no no fully black with zero opacity you see with zero opacity basically and what we're doing is we're masking the image and when you mask the image the black portion becomes transparent okay that's how that's the way that works and so if i go ahead and save this guys take a look at this if i say this boom right there this is what we have you see now look at this without this boom with this boom donezo done wow how cool is that guys what do you guys think huh what do you guys think that is pretty i would say that's pretty insane i will say i'll say i like that a lot so look at that what do you guys think let me know oh let me see who linear gradient beautiful rgba amazing somebody's saying your ass smash that thumbs up guys yes you guys know it of course always always hell yeah thumbs up beautiful all right awesome let's go continue on all right so we got that portion now it's going to work on the content section which is going to be the those product divs okay the content is actually going to be this section let's just for now let's make the section for example just background background white for now background white background white all right let's go and save this okay nothing so far okay back on why because why the content literally has nothing inside so i'm gonna say i'm gonna say [Laughter] don't judge all right no i don't no no i just be myself i know i know no for the background white if you look at our actual clone as you can see you see there's one number first thing is you will do is you see there's there's some padding as well and there's a max width to where it goes you see this right here there's a max width um so here's how we kind of want to go ahead and do it for the content section here's what's going to happen well number one the container for this container we're going to give the max width so for this container let's do max width width max width of what or 1500 pixels look right to the south now what does this mean if i go ahead and go to here you see you see that's a max without a 500 or 1500 pixels but but check this out you see how do we now center this image this whole container i want it to be centered in the middle so that it's kind of like right here now we can do that use something called margin zero auto okay if i do this boom okay if i do margin margin right here now if i zero auto okay now watch this watch this watch remember before watch this boom right there now we have ourselves a fully centered div that's called margin zero auto okay just so you guys understand beautiful and now with that said what now let's think about what we're going to do for the content the content is now here which is beautiful it's amazing okay i'm going to for the content i'm going to give it a padding so i'm going to say padding left pending left of 10 pixels and i will say padding right of 10 pixels as well boom so i just pushed this to the this side okay now big problem here big problemo how do we move it up how do we move these products up that's a good question what do you think david what do you think i would say margin margin minus something so so check this out this is really cool i want you guys i want you guys to pay attention really closely here okay while i'll take a sip of water [Laughter] oh yeah hydration don't pay attention to me pay attention to the code all right so look at this um one really cool thing with margin all right so are you listening let me know in the comments you're listening check this out if i have for example margin here let's say this is this is the content okay now margin pushes it up so for example margin up let's say six pixels right it's gonna push this what this container down correct this whole container is going to go down yes or no correct if i do margin top six pistols yes or no but here's my question what if i do margin top minus six pixels the opposite what if i do that and it's gonna be negative margin so look instead of pushing basically instead of pushing it down instead of creating space here it's actually going to push it up so margin top minus six pistol is basically like it's basically like for example taking this container right here taking this container boom and literally moving this container this whole container this whole container i'll put a circle up with minus six pixels right so what is the issue right now the issue is very simple well the issue right now is that we have this thing which is all the way here now how do we move it up so that it is where right here it should be right yeah what do we do tell me what do we do tell me huh well that is what we do yeah what we can do is we can do margin top margin top guys yeah and i would say 350 pixels in negative margin this top minus 350 pixels boom shakalaka we got this [Laughter] a margin margin hey look at that you see that right there margin top right there that's all honestly we needed that's pretty much it how cool is that what do you think i think that's pretty cool huh i think it's pretty super cool yeah i think it's pretty cool i love it right so that's pretty awesome so now we have what's up let me just ask you this because uh it just came into my mind too somebody in the comment whole dot asks uh what if what about position absolute what's your take on that so position absolute is not something you want to use you try not to install it on in any case position of salute is going to position it like directly there um it's a people don't use it you are not going to be able to scroll because you won't be able to scroll exactly well no technically you still be able to scroll it's fine but the position of silhouette is if you make a relative to that specification item i highly recommend you don't do something like that it takes it it takes the whole thing out of context so for example let's say there's a you know you know there's imagine this if you have pages right it goes one page after the other page right if you do position absolute it's the same thing as taking this page ripping it out oh [ __ ] hold on rip it ripping out the page and then absolutely position it come on absolutely position it anywhere you want okay that's called position absolute so let's say absolute top you see it's lost absolute position has lost its context where it actually is if you move the pat notepad the that single piece of paper is not going to move but exactly exactly so that's what you guys need to understand you want to use it use it as less as possible was that a pretty cool explanation to you guys i think so too [Laughter] so i said absolute is bad for your health yeah so i would recommend you guys not do that okay now what's gonna happen now is let's go how much do we have we have about 10 minutes that's just fine that's fine so we got that portion the next thing on a portion is let's go ahead and actually go ahead and create the product pages for this section let me go ahead and do this good we got this portion that's awesome look at this guys next thing i want to go ahead and do is let's go ahead and link up link up what well we'll go ahead and link up the well what do we really want to link link up the amazon logo okay let's link that amazon logo here wait what let's link the app's not going to be the homepage to be the homepage so it's cool yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so let's go to hire the gs awesome and let's go ahead and okay link is right there on the header logo all i gotta do is gonna do a link link to what right there boom nice link is added in there awesome okay let's go refresh boom all right so if i could now go to cart you see this is now the link here boom look at that beautiful guys that is amazing that is what i think it's production already bro i i really i really did pretty much professionally it's pretty much i would say so i would say so all right so sweet so look we got that portion now let's go ahead back to our amazon logo let's create in our product page so so if we think about this okay we have a few things now well what do we have we have this right here we have this right and we have this correct mundo yes we do all right so the next thing to do is we need to now create what a product okay a product now a product here is in multiple rows right we have this is one row right here and then we have three products in this row correct mundo yes indeed so let's actually work on that we're calling in the home page okay we're calling the home page i want us to create two products okay let's think about this now if i'm on the home page okay on the content page all right let's now create what what do you guys think let's create the product component all right so here's what i'll do i'll create source oop source i'll say new file and i say product product dot that's one product okay i'm gonna do rfce oh and that's now our price i'm saying product producto producto okay producto okay so that is producto guys we're almost 800 likes god you look so good so good 800. that is insane so producto all right home.gs good good good now on the producto portion let's go and import producto okay all right so we'll go to home we'll say import product product from what i don't know just ask if somebody speaks spanish in the house uh anybody obliged espanol uhhuh i i do you know you know i certainly do have to warm up my spanish yeah no i don't either i know i don't i don't know yeah me too so look so look now check this out okay beautiful all right now what we do is we're going to now do product so i'm going to say product here product product boom done probably fine perfect product not defined because i probably wrong good all right so producto is right there awesome now producto is going to have a few different things it's going to have a container here okay good because it's going to do style components so we'll say here import what are we importing david uh you need to be importing the style from styled components what did you do bro i don't know didn't like me [Laughter] from i got this styled dash components equals components okay good good good good good good so save that let's refresh this containers are defined perfect because why you do const container and you can see guys as i'm going through this stuff right i'm always able to solve the problem very pretty much simply just by kind of going one by one one step at a time as part of coding you're doing things one step at a time that's one thing when i'll make sure you guys understand we'll do background color here color let's do background color we're going to say white correct white but come on somebody came in with russian what that's what it could be that's fine what do you mean ukrainian and russian is fine where but you move no no i was just checking if anybody speaks spanish i mean somebody said johan says johanna say why don't you guys respond guys i mean we're trying to respond we're also coding you know we got 10 things at the same time you know it's really hard to code and respond at the same time guys all right somebody said are we building the back end no we are building the front end guys okay something no hablo espanol that's funny product wow wow so are we also creating the back end that could support a multivendor marketplace or is it just a front so we're doing the front end right now so we're doing the front right now and then we'll have a back end side of things where we'll be able to connect this with a database okay that's what we're working on guys just so you know all right so get the background color white might did i say background color white correct by the way did it right okay uh yeah i think so now the reason why the background color white on the container is not showing up is well a few very simple things let me go ahead and inspect down with them this morning do we even initialize that yeah we did don't worry about it you did okay so let's go ahead and inspect them on this one yeah where is it right there's a product right there good good good good now this product has a background color what exactly now check this out if i do see index how do i do a hundred okay maybe i gotta do z what's up what'd you say i said something magical is happening what is magic what's happening i mean you're covering the the whole thing that that that's happening so so look guys you can see right now we have see text and it's kind of like seethrough it's transparent is that correct that's right right so the issue that's going on right now is this this linear gradient color thing the bob is preventing a lot of things from happening which is very unfortunate because i don't like it because well i mean you'll see why in a second here but what i want to do is for the product number one i'm going to make this product a zindex c index of a hundred okay good okay that's fine and then i'm going to go to for example home.js i'm going to make this i'm going to remove this i don't need this anymore all right okay that's the content here and this will also be the content will also be what a z index of 100 pixels okay it's still not working the way i want to be but now look at this if i go to the banner and i see z index you don't have to have to pick not something i wanted to uh wait wait wait wait wait you you made the typo i just fixed it i got you bro yeah but it's still not the way i want it to be look at this the index of minus one you see that right you see i think no no i think you want to have one instead of uh z index boom and and you have you have to have one because the hundred is above one so it's going to be above anyway you're just being explicit about it okay so like you see it's still kind of not there to where i want it to be because the content is not still still not background color white what do we do in that case what do you think um i mean can you actually like point on the screen with the pointer yeah like where is the product because i still product is here this is the product okay there's a product right there okay right what we're trying to do is we're trying crea creating a div or trying to create a div right here and that's kind of the hard part that we're working somebody said put the index of one we did we put the index of one right here good let me see z index there was a some some thing that i had to do i forgot what did i do before to make this let me see what can we do in that case what can we do to fix this product to have an actual background color white because the problem right now is that this product is hidden wait what just do i just changed the background color to blue from white and it's for some reason it's now working but if i change it back to white uh wait what let me think let me think so banner is the index of one so product content let me see what did i do on here potentially embassy because i always have it in different situations too so um a thing has to do potentially with let's see max height so product what do you guys what do you guys think huh what do you guys think let me see use hex values this is the order only figure out with white bro try z x one z index two you didn't specify the size or two container and product component okay so let's try this so let's go ahead and do the product.gs let's do the size let's do width for example let's do the width on this one of like 300 200 pixels and let's do height also 300 pixels i think now you see the gradient what because the gradient has also been applied to this image too that's why so this is the okay huh okay that's just how it works don't worry about it so look let's see let's take a look at this and don't worry we'll figure it out let's see background color white that's fine i think it's partially because let me see if i go ahead and if i save this let's go to home.gs no it's still not it it's not what i wanted to do so z index of 100 that's fine maybe needs to be display flex what if i do display flex on it let me see if i do the banner whatever display flex on the content play flex oh look at that wait what oh that's funny oh that's funny oh man you just put a display flex in the content and it solved it yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't know why that's a big issue a lot of developers have like i don't know why guys i mean i kind of understand why what do you guys think why that's the case what do you think huh producto why did all of a sudden become that because the issue before this was the fact that basically producto was part of the mask right so it was being masked as well the second i put display flex though what if i do display block no display inline block no uh display flex i guess is the only option okay so that's a bit odd so i know right that's a little odd but that's fine it's really fun so the reason why it's like this actually is pretty fairly fairly simple guys check this out right i think it's it's because what jasmine goes in the comments because display flex fixes everything [Laughter] exactly [Laughter] exactly exactly oh guys somebody said guys if you have a problem just type display flex oh my god it's some sort of magic stuff position relative that could have been good you only said flex is a you only said flex is a must but granted look is the enix is still still important if i remove this this this won't work fully oh will it let me see content oh [ __ ] this i guess venus is not does not even matter here too much let me see so content hold on hold on so that's good so the index of one on this one i think because it creates it makes the content to be um like its own container i think that's why let's not be part of it so hey i think but how cool is that huh hmm somebody says because when you say display flex the product product flexes its muscles and gets seen by people since it doesn't have chicken arms oh my gosh that's the funniest one i've heard so far oh my god that's funny because the flexes it's muscles guys that's why yeah flex is always a savior there we go so that's interesting so that worked okay so that's cool so look at this now we have one product now let's think about this so if we had display flex okay what if we have two products now okay can i can i let's say this let's see go to product gs producto let's make this forget the width forget the width okay instead what i'm going to do is let's do this producto and now we'll go ahead and go the home.gs file and let's edit one more product so we have two one product oh done oh we have product sorry thoughts now what do you guys think we need to do in order to go ahead and spread these out you know so that they take up the full width well that's very simple all i gotta do is go to product right and i say producto and i say what flex if i remove the xenix here will still work oh [ __ ] look at this this has to have a xenix too oh my that's a really interesting combination so this needs to have a z index and wow that's so interesting i guess these shouldn't match by the way i don't understand how this works honestly but this is i mean i mean i know how it works let's debug yes no honestly honestly guys sometimes i don't know how it works okay i'm a teacher but sometimes i don't know i'll be fully honest with you and and i'm okay with that all right so it works exactly so let's do this guys um now one thing i want to do is i want to add a padding so let's do padding padding putting 20 pixels on each product so flex one we'll do padding 20 pixels good no not uh yeah we can do pending as well that's fine too i like that that's fine let's also do the following it's also make sure that we have a margin of 10 pixels too so we'll say margin guys and what do you think is pro module will do well module will do a few things margin 10 pixels what what do you mean it's working fine right what's that it's working good producto right so 10 pixels that's awesome next thing we need to do is the following is so uh what are we going to say that then see a line i understand i don't want that that's fine okay now every product guys if you look at the thing what does every product have it has a title okay has a title it has a price it has some stars it has a picture and it has a cart button correct so let's add that right now are you ready of course you gotta get that in sometimes you know all right beautiful that's how we do cool cool cool i'm sorry i even prepared a prepare the data for you yes thank you so much thank you so much holy moly monk appears about to die awesome not my laptop is about to die that's fine i'll uh i know that's okay that's okay i know it's okay so guys so we got the title let's go ahead and do this we got the title what are you gonna do the product product the product is going to have a few different things well the first thing is going to have is if i go to product if we go to product gs it's going to have what well the title is first first thing so let's go ahead and take a look at this good good good good good so let's do title right that can be one component right that's gonna be title right right there that's me one component i'm going to go ahead and close this part out right there beautiful that's gonna be one component and then in the title after that is gonna be what the price so let's go ahead and do price price boom right there and then after that is going to be what after the price we're going to have the following we're going to have ratings right so rating rating right there beautiful that's going to close this part out as well boom beautiful nice nice job nazadi and and uh and david um i mean i mean who else will you know besides yourself you know sometimes you gotta do that man all right oh of course yeah okay we have that let's go and save this good so it's rating that's good so that's rating next up is gonna be what after that one is going to be what the image so then we'll have the image itself so we'll say image yeah product image but it's the image is going to close itself because it's going to have it's just going to have a source right correct correct image and then after that portion is gonna be what well that's gonna be a button so we'll say uh bhutan so add to cart add to cart on right there okay and that's gonna be no no that will have a add to cart buttons right there so we'll do bouton and this will be add to cart to add to cart right there beautiful guys all right so add to cart is right here nice okay so we have the layout of the whole thing let's do this the title i'm gonna give it some placeholder data right the title one right there right there you see i'm gonna copy literally this whatever you wanna do let's do for example ipad pro i don't know whatever you wanna do so ipad pro price is 1449 we could put in here too no problem whatsoever again this is please hold data for now and then we'll be able to use the database to actually get data now reading here's the cool thing about the reading the way we can do it is the following we can literally just do stars boom right exactly there's actually you can actually just copy the star emoji and actually paste it in there and that's the emoji that i want to show you right there it's it's pretty pretty cool i will say that and then finally we have the image and this down image is going to have a source of the following and he will go ahead and copy and paste this for you guys so you guys have it as well and then you have the add to cart button now let's define these things underneath oh it's already been done never mind so the title is a styled p tag but actually i want it to be a style span tag not sp text pen okay and then for the price also style spin tag reason why i say span type because the p tag has a lot of uh styling that's automatically applied i don't want that that doesn't look so good i didn't know that it does it does then the product rating that's gonna be just a simple div then the aim is to be image add button is going to be a button now the button is going to have a few different things and we'll talk about that in a second here so now let's think about this the title now let's talk about the css of this stuff okay very important let's go and take a look at this what do we have so far oh [ __ ] what just happened oh look at this it works somehow wow that's cool it works guys look at this beautiful now of course it does i know i know i know and of course now so a few things for this thing okay one thing i want to do is make sure is let's go ahead and remove this min height instead i want to do is i want to add a max height for this actually let's do a max height for um should we do a max height what do you think yeah definitely i mean yeah let's do a match light big big screen yeah let's do a max height of 400 pixels on this one because it's too much max height or 400 pixels because that will make maximum that will basically decrease the height of everything else which is good okay save that okay refresh it nothing's going to change so far so don't worry about that yeah okay that's gonna there's a reason why it's like this okay and then what's gonna happen the title uh let's do the following i think the title is fine let's go look at the price so the price is going to be the following so the price is going to be let's see font weight we're going to change the weight of this one to make it a little bit bolder so we'll say font weight of what 500. okay good make a little bit more price and then we'll do we'll do a few things in terms of like uh let's see font weight and then we'll give it a well nothing so far but check this out the price and the title you see how from the left from right well we need to actually make them from top to bottom so how do we go ahead and put the price from top to bottom or how do we put all these titles from top to bottom again display flags to the rescue what i know when when are you gonna use grin maybe next time we'll see maybe next video maybe okay okay okay so here's what we'll do what's the display flex remember display flex right here guys display flex display flex beautiful okay okay now you can see it put it from left to right now to put it from top to bottom all you gotta do is change the flags directly be column like so so flax direction color and boom right there you've got yourself something like this see right there beautiful next thing i'm going to do is look at this i'm going to say margin top here margin type on the price margin top and that's going to be a margin top of 3 pixels boom beautiful so that is nice i like that that's amazing now the image that's gonna be one one of the things i want to talk about right the object image i'm gonna give this image a max max height of 200 pixels so for the image i'm going to say here look at this i'm going to say this one i'm going to say max height of 200 pixels boom boom you see big difference now now um so max's 200 pixels now for the object fit well here's what we'll do now i'm going to say object fit fit now contain now here you see now right now how it's kind of stretched out that's not good guys that's bad right it's trying to stretch out to intro to stretch out as much as possible we limited the height now because that's going to stretch out as much as possible here which is not good that's not what we want and someone say object contain to save that so if i go refresh this boom right there object fit contain do like that's my pretty much what's up magnificent magnificent magnifico magnifico beautiful so now the add to cart button that's gonna be what the next thing i want to organize with us guys okay so here's the here's the button right there let's make this button a lot lot lot cleaner and that's gonna look a little like this number one is for this button let's do a um a width of 100 pixels weight of 100 pixels okay now what i'm do is i'm gonna put this here so you guys can see a little better here with 100 pixels damn it i'm gonna make this smaller in that case with 100 pixels right and then what's going to happen is right there that's going to change the width of this button so let's go ahead if i go ahead and save this boom right now and then the background color is going to be this portion let's create this background color no problem okay now let's do the border for this specific thing okay let's do the border for this one so we'll do what good nice job so border two pixels solid and here this portion right here guys that's the width of the border that's the style of the border right here and this is the color of the border that's kind of how you do it right there okay guys good good good so if i go ahead and save this beautiful nice awesome next up is gonna be what border radius of two pixels nice god god gotta go god go to god nice and what is it going to be i'm going to save that okay now we have a little bit of a circular button height of 30 pixels nice ah beautiful and look at that that looks so so so much better now we're not done yet how do you go ahead and center these now in a center because right now it's just like looks wonky right how do we stand this at the car button in the center what do you think huh what do you think i would just simply put like um use another div and then just put them in the center oh we can do it okay that's fine that's fine that's fine what i would honestly do is introduce a new div on the top here for the for all these details so those are not going to be centered but they are going to be aligned to the left okay that's fine everything is going to be centered good i like that or what we can do is very simple i can go to here check this out to decide i can do i can do this i can actually create different around here so i can do for example here i can i can say the action but action action uh section action section action section boom boom boom did you name it like that what's up action section the reason why we're creating this because look at this i want to be able to create another div that i can that can set so that it can go ahead and center everything in so action section look at this he's already creating action section div style.div and with this action section all i do is display flex okay display flags guys that's pretty much it and all i got to do is align no not just for content no not a lot items no no i don't i do both i do both fine okay you fancy pants okay that's fine and just if i can't descend it so what's gonna happen here is here's what we've done we created a container here called display flex and then what we did is we allowed it okay we allowed this div to be fully kind of centered vertically understood guys and this is why weed did that and so it makes things a lot a lot simpler for so many other reasons just so you guys know okay because that's good that's good we got the or or place items and that works that works too so now this is centered without the action section right here if we did place item center then the whole thing will be centered guys just so you know the whole thing this thing this thing everything but i just wanted this thing to be centered and so that's why i created we created another container beautiful now look at this this is pretty cool one last thing that i want to do david is you know what spacing okay that's fine spacing is good too yes that's that's important but not that what do you want to do then background color of this page of this full page guys we are almost done for today i'm not kidding we look at what we just created guys we have the banner we have the card page it looks sick okay now what i want to do is i'm going to go to the body let's go to here let's go to app.css for the body okay i want to change the background and color to this specific portion i'm going to copy this i got this david i got this duvet i know you want to type but it's here right there whoa look at this boom right there so here's what happens guys look at this this whole background color oh actually that's not good i don't like that okay wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait i think it's because i need to go back to now my app.js and then for the div class name app let's see at this css i mean if you're not using css let's not do then let's not use css how do i make this whole thing color of that i mean then you want to go to app.js import style uh import style and no no no no no no no no no no no app but i need to make this background color of this maybe i need to make this background color i mean we can say app here instead of this this thing sort of what let's do it with a stop component right so if you go ahead uh in app.js we import styled components notice the rename the div uh with like th this this guy was a div and you can go into the app okay that's fine yeah i named it app and now i'm gonna um you can't absolutely div i mean it's still the same situation that's fine yeah well div and now we can or what was actually the background color what yeah yeah oh yeah okay and now it's the same situation what's up whoa that's new app has already been declared yes because you cannot do app into container david container then we do container that's all good all right container guys okay good so container is what we're gonna call okay good holy moly that's fine all right it's not like it still doesn't do what i want to do because here's the thing you see this bottom section i think it has to do something with the height i think that's what it has to do i think we need to work on the height of the actual thing let me see let me just think here for a second we have the app we have the app.css that's fine how do we go ahead what's going on here let me see inspect element icon color let me see a separate window where is that wait what's up let me see so what i'm trying to do is the background color you see how it's it's wonky here i don't like it so let me see minimum height that's fine that's fine back on what's there's add the linear gradient the what oh oh here's there we go that's why look at this right there you see this oh that's on the content so that's what was messed up the whole time you see this right there you see the guys so now this looks a lot lot better you see this background white that was the issue the whole time boom boom boom boom boom so if i go see this is why it's so important guys sometimes to be able to go for example to see the big picture this is why i like to go into an inspect element right here i like to see the big picture that we have and i can play around because you know going back and forth trying to try different things it's going to take a long time and react gs and so instead i like to go to stop you i like to inspect element go to it check check and check and check and see kind of what may change that makes and so that allows you to really easily see it and so what that does now if i go back to my home.gs if i go back to content with my content back on white you see i can just now remove this right there someone goes in the comments try to display flex hello display affects everything beautiful so guys look at this guys look at what we have created here as you can see this is the amazon clone that we have so far how cool does that look what do you guys think so far let us know in the comments below guys we have it's been two hours now look how far we've gone in the next two days we're gonna really finish this up we're gonna make this actually dynamic being able to use it with a database and just make this a lot lot better we're going to create the cart page which is gonna which is gonna be this page that's gonna be the next thing we'll create and so it's going to be a lot more fun okay a lot more not a lot more fun but a lot more uh what's it called um i mean yeah but a lot more dynamics i'm trying to say but so as you can see at this point we have finished the amazon clone you guys have done it guys let us know in the comments below who was able to pay attention actually go with me if you were not that's completely fine that's you know there's no problem whatsoever uh somebody said are we gonna use the monkey no we're going to use firebase guys yeah it's like it's just so much better yes yes yes it's just better yes yeah it's always better guys i'm excited for tomorrow says the sun i got it let's go guys so guys this has been an epic one all

there dunzo that's all i can say bro any prerequisites for firebase no not really all you got to do is make sure you create the account firebase that's the only thing i will ask you but no email no that's all i think you have a gmail account that's it sir i love a lot sir are you going to use redux maybe maybe that's maybe maybe yes maybe no maybe we'll use redux that'll be actually pretty good i think that'd be really awesome for us to use redux maybe we can use redux yes or no yes aws versus firebase well um so good question i mean firebase is a very very popular you know uh database aws i mean is is more than just firebase just so you know guys know aws is everything it's been able to deploy to essences it's been able to have like if it is pretty much can do anything on you know for your project may that be to serve on the server may that be to have different servers but david to scale right firebase is mainly made for kind of database you know uh and so forth for example go ahead you can host of that oh yeah sorry yeah but aws for example has many different file databases like aws right so there's uh there's my sequel database there's a no sql database and so forth firebase is just a nosql database guys right and so there's a lot more to aws and voice and more recommend to learn i'll recommend for you guys to learn both no firebase and also no what no aws so
