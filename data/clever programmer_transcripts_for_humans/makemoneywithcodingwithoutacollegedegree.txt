00:00 - yo what's up fam it's been a minute
00:02 - since we've done a video on something
00:03 - like this but i wanted to talk to you
00:05 - about how to actually make money with
00:07 - coding and this is something i used to
00:09 - talk a lot about on the channel before
00:11 - but then after a while you know i kind
00:13 - of stopped talking about it because i
00:14 - just felt like people were like cause
00:16 - he's just talking too much about money
00:19 - and whatever and so we just need to code
00:21 - so then i just like shut up and i'm like
00:23 - whatever we're just gonna make videos on
00:24 - projects and tutorials and hopefully
00:27 - everybody's gonna stop
00:28 - complaining about
00:30 - me talking about money but today i'm
00:33 - going to bring that back and i will talk
00:34 - about how to actually make money with
00:36 - coding because
00:37 - like it or not it is the reason why a
00:40 - lot of people work
00:41 - yes you do want to do a job that really
00:44 - matters of course that makes sense but
00:45 - the primary reason for a lot of why we
00:47 - work so we can make money so then we get
00:49 - options and freedom to do whatever we
00:51 - want so in this video that's what we're
00:53 - going to talk about smash that like
00:54 - button before we get started by the way
00:56 - right before we get into this video i do

01:49 - crypto trades
01:51 - so with that out of the way let's get
01:53 - straight into the video now i understand
01:55 - there are a ton of youtubers out there
01:57 - that are talking about how to actually
01:58 - make money with coding online it's
02:01 - nothing new and everything almost
02:03 - everything under the sun that's been
02:05 - covered but i'm gonna try to provide it
02:07 - from my point of view as a developer
02:10 - who's went from making a thousand
02:12 - dollars a month to three thousand
02:14 - dollars a month eventually making five
02:15 - thousand dollars a month to ten thousand
02:17 - dollars a month
02:18 - and then eventually having a channel and
02:21 - scaling that up to a hundred thousand
02:22 - dollars a month and beyond so hopefully
02:26 - that'll give you some interesting
02:27 - insights mixed with tips on programming
02:30 - and software development along with tips
02:33 - on just business acumen and things of
02:36 - that nature so let's talk about the most
02:38 - obvious way to make money as a developer
02:41 - and let's start with that so the most
02:42 - obvious way to make money as a developer
02:44 - is you become good enough
02:47 - through a degree without a degree you go
02:49 - and apply and you get a job and you
02:51 - become a full-time developer or whatever
02:54 - okay that's a great way that's the most
02:56 - obvious way then there are a lot of
02:57 - other ways right so you can just go get
02:59 - a full-time job become a full-time
03:02 - developer but i think that what are the
03:05 - nuances that you can have within that
03:07 - and that's what really matters and i
03:09 - want to talk about those things too so
03:10 - if you're applying as a developer think
03:14 - about it there's so many other people
03:15 - that are also applying as a developer
03:17 - and it there is a huge commodity and
03:19 - then you're competing against people in
03:21 - pakistan india sri lanka kenya ghana
03:25 - all these different places that i even
03:27 - hire a lot of my developers from because
03:29 - you can't compete with them they're
03:30 - better than you they work harder than
03:32 - you their work ethic is better they're
03:34 - not as entitled and they charge way less
03:37 - so it makes sense and a lot of people do
03:39 - that a lot of companies do that and i
03:41 - think that's why freelancing becomes
03:42 - really hard but in u.s if you're getting
03:44 - a full-time job they are looking for
03:46 - people in the us and let's talk about
03:48 - why they're doing that a lot of the
03:49 - times primarily they're looking for
03:51 - developers who also have good
03:53 - communication skills because that's one
03:55 - of the problems that i run into when i'm
03:57 - hiring somebody that's the problem that
03:59 - i see communication is often lacking
04:01 - when we hire somebody overseas so thing
04:03 - number one that's really important for
04:05 - you to keep in mind is communication
04:07 - skills that skill alone can actually
04:10 - make you really stand out even against
04:12 - other better developers because while
04:15 - you might not be as good of a developer
04:17 - we won't have communication problems and
04:18 - therefore in the long run you'll
04:20 - actually be a better developer working
04:22 - on my team okay and that's how a lot of
04:24 - employers think as well so
04:26 - something to keep in mind second thing
04:28 - how do you stand out and not just be a
04:30 - commodity well think about
04:32 - doing something that's harder right so
04:34 - i'll give you an example if you're
04:36 - somebody who can offer cleaning services
04:38 - for somebody right that's really good
04:40 - but a lot of people could do that and so
04:42 - that's a commodity you have to compete
04:43 - at pricing oftentimes on that now think
04:46 - about people who make so that's why
04:47 - those people also make a lot less money
04:49 - now think about who is making a lot of
04:51 - money surgeons and people who are
04:53 - doctors because it's hard to replace
04:55 - what they do this is very difficult so
04:57 - there are very few people who can become
04:59 - doctor go through that rigorous training
05:01 - be that adapt at medical field
05:03 - understanding all the vocabulary in the
05:05 - medical field and then being able to
05:08 - diagnose each patient differently or
05:10 - perform a heart surgery and so when you
05:12 - become very rare you start making a lot
05:15 - more income simply because you're much
05:17 - more in demand one of the biggest areas
05:20 - right now you can crush it as a
05:22 - developer is if you started heading into
05:26 - the blockchain world right the web 3
05:30 - world i wanted to tell you guys a story
05:32 - and maybe i'll do that in another video
05:33 - but even my friend nas he's doing a
05:36 - bunch of stuff you guys remember him
05:38 - from the channel before and now he's
05:40 - doing a bunch of stuff with nfts and
05:41 - things like that and just one
05:45 - client that he worked with paid 25 000
05:49 - and that project took him maybe a month
05:50 - to do that is
05:52 - insane no regular developer would even
05:55 - think of that level of money unless they
05:56 - were working at netflix google big four
05:59 - and then they had a high level position
06:01 - too really high level position it's not
06:03 - that it doesn't exist there are
06:04 - opportunities but you have to spot them
06:06 - and then you have to like find a way to
06:08 - fall in love with them and then get good
06:10 - at them and that's what makes it
06:11 - difficult and so if you can find those
06:14 - opportunities and spot them and become
06:16 - good at them then you have a
06:18 - very
06:19 - amazing
06:20 - and lucrative career opportunity in
06:22 - front of you and so i highly recommend
06:24 - you think about i want to become a
06:26 - developer because i enjoy it so that's
06:28 - really important i am willing to work my
06:30 - ass off and work incredibly hard and
06:32 - that's really important but then also
06:34 - what's really important is the niche
06:36 - that you fall into so if you're a
06:38 - developer that can help develop on
06:39 - ethereum or solana or one of these
06:41 - chains you're going to be much more
06:44 - sought after than a regular developer
06:46 - and even developers with only one or two
06:48 - years of experience and ethereum land
06:49 - they're making over a hundred thousand
06:51 - dollars a year whereas in a regular
06:53 - front-end developer that'd be really
06:55 - hard because you can find so many people
06:57 - and i experienced a similar thing so we
06:59 - wanted a higher uh we wanted a higher
07:00 - smart contract developers and every time
07:02 - we hired them they were so hard to find
07:05 - and even when we found somebody even
07:06 - with months of experience they we we
07:08 - paid them like five times more than
07:12 - a developer that we found that was like
07:15 - a front-end developer because there's
07:16 - the competition is just so crazy and so
07:18 - they don't get paid as much because it's
07:20 - a commodity and so you just have to
07:22 - think about it right what do you pick
07:24 - what do you choose what do you stick
07:25 - with and what do you grow on a lot of
07:27 - the videos that we're making right now
07:28 - on the channel are blockchain related
07:30 - and that's the primary reason why we're
07:32 - making them because that will give you a
07:34 - much bigger opportunity if you tap into
07:37 - the blockchain space to grow your skill
07:40 - set to grow your income and to have a
07:42 - much more lucrative career as a
07:44 - developer because that's so sought after
07:48 - right now and there's such a huge demand
07:50 - for it and so much of the world is
07:52 - moving into the blockchain slash crypto
07:54 - space so that's one of the things to
07:57 - really keep in mind here's another crazy
08:00 - thing to think about in the blockchain
08:02 - space and this is a huge opportunity and
08:04 - this is something actually i wanted to
08:05 - chase with my team but i think it's
08:08 - something that maybe i would want to do
08:10 - in the future because right now i do
08:11 - want to focus on growing this channel
08:13 - and just providing a lot of free
08:15 - valuable content out there for you guys
08:18 - but here's a big opportunity and it has
08:20 - to do with the web 3 bounties so in the
08:23 - crypto world a lot of companies are
08:25 - offering what they call bounties right
08:27 - so harmony wallet or harmony one wallet
08:30 - had this notion page that i don't know
08:32 - if we could find it or not they're
08:34 - offering 20 million dollars for people
08:36 - to build different parts of what they're
08:38 - looking for their web app and their
08:40 - mobile app and for example they're
08:41 - giving away seven million dollars in
08:44 - just the front end and they go hey if
08:45 - you can make this front end for our web
08:48 - app and let's say you can make the web
08:50 - app look like coinbase or you could make
08:52 - the mobile app look like coinbase
08:54 - they're willing to give you two million
08:55 - dollars for that if you can help set the
08:59 - get them a solid back end they might pay
09:01 - three million dollars for that if you
09:03 - want to focus more on the security
09:04 - aspect and help them integrate security
09:06 - they're willing to pay three to five
09:08 - million for that and the money in this
09:10 - space is so nuts because every single
09:13 - investor is just pouring their money
09:15 - into this a16z andreessen horowitz and a
09:19 - ton of other investors and so they are
09:21 - okay with giving away disproportionate
09:23 - amounts of money to incentivize you to
09:25 - help them build something because if
09:27 - they can move faster they can
09:28 - essentially dominate the market because
09:29 - everybody is like gonna lead and
09:31 - dominate the market if they move fast on
09:33 - this opportunity if they don't move fast
09:35 - then somebody else is going to come and
09:36 - eat them up so they see the opportunity
09:38 - to go and raise massive amounts of
09:40 - capitalist startups and then they're
09:42 - willing to go and distribute it so you
09:44 - could take a month or two months hunting
09:46 - this bounty and you could get maybe if
09:48 - you don't get two million dollars you
09:49 - get a hundred thousand dollars two
09:51 - hundred thousand dollars fifty thousand
09:53 - dollars twenty five thousand dollars
09:54 - even if you get ten thousand dollars
09:56 - think about that's one month of work or
09:58 - two months of work and is that worth it
10:00 - and it could be
10:01 - really worth it and really significant
10:03 - so web 3 bounties is a massive
10:06 - opportunity i would highly recommend you
10:08 - look into them also obviously if that
10:10 - wasn't clear what i've been saying right
10:12 - now web 3 jobs are also a massive
10:16 - opportunity okay so those are some of
10:18 - the different ones that i think not a
10:20 - lot of people are talking about those
10:21 - are massive ones but i'll go over some
10:24 - other ones that are more kind of obvious
10:26 - than other people have talked about too
10:28 - freelancing is a big one for example if
10:30 - you freelance but if you do it in a
10:32 - different way kind of like i'm sharing
10:34 - with you i think you have much higher
10:36 - opportunities as a freelancer you can
10:38 - make money right and with coding another
10:40 - one that's interesting that not a lot of
10:41 - people talk about is tutoring so you
10:43 - could go on platforms like yzant or
10:45 - takelessons.com or some other ones
10:46 - people will
10:48 - people will pay you to teach them coding
10:50 - and i bet if you could teach people
10:51 - solidity or
10:53 - rust they will pay you twice or three
10:56 - times as much to teach them so let's say
10:58 - that with regular coding you could
10:59 - charge a hundred dollars an hour or
11:01 - fifty dollars an hour if you're teaching
11:03 - somebody solidity you could charge
11:04 - seventy five hundred two hundred three
11:06 - hundred dollars an hour and i bet there
11:08 - are a lot of people willing to pay that
11:10 - so they could learn solidity or rust any
11:13 - of the blockchain web 3 programming
11:16 - languages other ways you can do this and
11:18 - make money is of course you could start
11:20 - your own startup or you can launch your
11:21 - own sas business that's much much harder
11:24 - there's luck involved there's a ton of
11:26 - skill involved and there's a whole like
11:29 - you have to fully learn business and so
11:31 - not everybody's going to have a knack
11:33 - for that obviously that's one of the
11:35 - best places and one of the most
11:36 - lucrative places you know because then
11:38 - you can launch a company like phantom
11:40 - wallet or metamask or something like
11:42 - that and have millions of users and then
11:44 - the world is your oyster essentially
11:46 - that's really hard and rare and so i
11:49 - would say at least build some level of
11:50 - experience as a software developer
11:52 - because to be honest to start a sas
11:54 - company you're not gonna if you don't
11:55 - have background as a software developer
11:57 - you're just gonna throw your money away
11:58 - and not make anything successful and
12:01 - yeah it'll be terrible so i wouldn't
12:03 - start a startup and a sas company on
12:06 - if you don't know software development
12:08 - unless you have a ton of money and you
12:10 - can blow it and not worry about it and
12:12 - you're okay with losing that then you
12:14 - can take a try on it if you don't know
12:16 - software development and you don't have
12:18 - a lot of money i would never recommend
12:20 - starting a sas startup that would be
12:22 - really hard but of course you could try
12:24 - it i don't want to discourage anybody
12:26 - the other one is content creation as a
12:28 - developer which is what i do which is
12:30 - what a ton of other
12:32 - people do whether it's joma tech or
12:35 - programming with mosh or whoever is out
12:39 - there right all these content creators
12:40 - as developers it's very simple
12:43 - generally
12:44 - they make videos that help a ton of
12:46 - people think of us like glorified
12:48 - teachers
12:49 - we are essentially teachers we love
12:51 - teaching i love teaching and we're
12:53 - sharing this with people and then if you
12:56 - get a following big enough you could
12:58 - sell a course you can monetize it with
13:00 - youtube or you could do kind of a little
13:03 - bit of what we're doing which is we're
13:04 - going hey we'll keep a lot of stuff for
13:06 - you for free but then we'll go charge
13:08 - these companies to teach their
13:09 - technology or train you on them and then
13:11 - it's a win-win for everybody the
13:12 - companies win you win and you guys get a
13:15 - ton of free content so it's
13:17 - doesn't matter how you set up your
13:19 - business model you could even do it
13:21 - where you have your channel and then you
13:22 - just like tutor people because you're
13:24 - starting to get a ton of tutoring
13:25 - clients whatever the case may be so when
13:28 - you have your own channel when you ever
13:30 - when you have your own source the amount
13:32 - that what what you could do with it is
13:34 - infinite having a brand is really it's
13:36 - definitely one of the most valuable
13:38 - things you could do but again not
13:39 - everybody enjoys that and that's not
13:42 - everybody's cup of tea but obviously
13:44 - doing content creation is a huge
13:46 - opportunity for developers and a lot of
13:49 - developers have taken to that right
13:51 - traversing media fire ship coder coder
13:55 - and a lot of the coding community i mean
13:57 - forgetting their name that guy that made
13:59 - the stock trading video cal uh cali
14:02 - haldon yeah the list of developer coding
14:05 - channel goes on so those are some of the
14:08 - ways that i've listed out and just to
14:10 - kind of recap talked about freelancing
14:12 - tutoring web three bounties a full-time
14:15 - job startups and content creation as a
14:18 - dev so we really talked about six
14:20 - different ways my main takeaway for you
14:22 - is don't be a commodity
14:24 - learn something that's more niche
14:26 - that'll make your life a lot easier
14:27 - focus on communication skills because
14:29 - that helps you stand out and that's how
14:32 - you can provide a ton more value in the
14:34 - market and that's how you could charge a
14:36 - ton of more money and then whether you
14:38 - go freelancing or full time those will
14:40 - all give you uh really good chances of
14:43 - being able to make significant amount of
14:45 - money as a developer while enjoying your
14:47 - career again i just want to make sure
14:50 - right you understand none of this is
14:52 - easy this all requires tremendous amount
14:55 - of hard work so
14:57 - understand that you should i'm not going
14:59 - to say must but i'm just going to say
15:01 - you should love it to a certain extent
15:03 - because if you don't i know too many
15:05 - people who are in nighty field that are
15:07 - absolutely miserable with their lives
15:08 - and hate them so i don't want you to be
15:11 - one of them i want you to love your life
15:13 - enjoy your life and make good money as a
15:15 - developer that's it for me i hope you

understand there are a ton of youtubers out there that are talking about how to actually make money with coding online it's nothing new and everything almost everything under the sun that's been covered but i'm gonna try to provide it from my point of view as a developer who's went from making a thousand dollars a month to three thousand dollars a month eventually making five thousand dollars a month to ten thousand dollars a month and then eventually having a channel and scaling that up to a hundred thousand dollars a month and beyond so hopefully that'll give you some interesting insights mixed with tips on programming and software development along with tips on just business acumen and things of that nature so let's talk about the most obvious way to make money as a developer and let's start with that so the most obvious way to make money as a developer is you become good enough through a degree without a degree you go and apply and you get a job and you become a fulltime developer or whatever okay that's a great way that's the most obvious way then there are a lot of other ways right so you can just go get a fulltime job become a fulltime developer but i think that what are the nuances that you can have within that and that's what really matters and i want to talk about those things too so if you're applying as a developer think about it there's so many other people that are also applying as a developer and it there is a huge commodity and then you're competing against people in pakistan india sri lanka kenya ghana all these different places that i even hire a lot of my developers from because you can't compete with them they're better than you they work harder than you their work ethic is better they're not as entitled and they charge way less so it makes sense and a lot of people do that a lot of companies do that and i think that's why freelancing becomes really hard but in u.s if you're getting a fulltime job they are looking for people in the us and let's talk about why they're doing that a lot of the times primarily they're looking for developers who also have good communication skills because that's one of the problems that i run into when i'm hiring somebody that's the problem that i see communication is often lacking when we hire somebody overseas so thing number one that's really important for you to keep in mind is communication skills that skill alone can actually make you really stand out even against other better developers because while you might not be as good of a developer we won't have communication problems and therefore in the long run you'll actually be a better developer working on my team okay and that's how a lot of employers think as well so something to keep in mind second thing how do you stand out and not just be a commodity well think about doing something that's harder right so i'll give you an example if you're somebody who can offer cleaning services for somebody right that's really good but a lot of people could do that and so that's a commodity you have to compete at pricing oftentimes on that now think about people who make so that's why those people also make a lot less money now think about who is making a lot of money surgeons and people who are doctors because it's hard to replace what they do this is very difficult so there are very few people who can become doctor go through that rigorous training be that adapt at medical field understanding all the vocabulary in the medical field and then being able to diagnose each patient differently or perform a heart surgery and so when you become very rare you start making a lot more income simply because you're much more in demand one of the biggest areas right now you can crush it as a developer is if you started heading into the blockchain world right the web 3 world i wanted to tell you guys a story and maybe i'll do that in another video but even my friend nas he's doing a bunch of stuff you guys remember him from the channel before and now he's doing a bunch of stuff with nfts and things like that and just one client that he worked with paid 25 000 and that project took him maybe a month to do that is insane no regular developer would even think of that level of money unless they were working at netflix google big four and then they had a high level position too really high level position it's not that it doesn't exist there are opportunities but you have to spot them and then you have to like find a way to fall in love with them and then get good at them and that's what makes it difficult and so if you can find those opportunities and spot them and become good at them then you have a very amazing and lucrative career opportunity in front of you and so i highly recommend you think about i want to become a developer because i enjoy it so that's really important i am willing to work my ass off and work incredibly hard and that's really important but then also what's really important is the niche that you fall into so if you're a developer that can help develop on ethereum or solana or one of these chains you're going to be much more sought after than a regular developer and even developers with only one or two years of experience and ethereum land they're making over a hundred thousand dollars a year whereas in a regular frontend developer that'd be really hard because you can find so many people and i experienced a similar thing so we wanted a higher uh we wanted a higher smart contract developers and every time we hired them they were so hard to find and even when we found somebody even with months of experience they we we paid them like five times more than a developer that we found that was like a frontend developer because there's the competition is just so crazy and so they don't get paid as much because it's a commodity and so you just have to think about it right what do you pick what do you choose what do you stick with and what do you grow on a lot of the videos that we're making right now on the channel are blockchain related and that's the primary reason why we're making them because that will give you a much bigger opportunity if you tap into the blockchain space to grow your skill set to grow your income and to have a much more lucrative career as a developer because that's so sought after right now and there's such a huge demand for it and so much of the world is moving into the blockchain slash crypto space so that's one of the things to really keep in mind here's another crazy thing to think about in the blockchain space and this is a huge opportunity and this is something actually i wanted to chase with my team but i think it's something that maybe i would want to do in the future because right now i do want to focus on growing this channel and just providing a lot of free valuable content out there for you guys but here's a big opportunity and it has to do with the web 3 bounties so in the crypto world a lot of companies are offering what they call bounties right so harmony wallet or harmony one wallet had this notion page that i don't know if we could find it or not they're offering 20 million dollars for people to build different parts of what they're looking for their web app and their mobile app and for example they're giving away seven million dollars in just the front end and they go hey if you can make this front end for our web app and let's say you can make the web app look like coinbase or you could make the mobile app look like coinbase they're willing to give you two million dollars for that if you can help set the get them a solid back end they might pay three million dollars for that if you want to focus more on the security aspect and help them integrate security they're willing to pay three to five million for that and the money in this space is so nuts because every single investor is just pouring their money into this a16z andreessen horowitz and a ton of other investors and so they are okay with giving away disproportionate amounts of money to incentivize you to help them build something because if they can move faster they can essentially dominate the market because everybody is like gonna lead and dominate the market if they move fast on this opportunity if they don't move fast then somebody else is going to come and eat them up so they see the opportunity to go and raise massive amounts of capitalist startups and then they're willing to go and distribute it so you could take a month or two months hunting this bounty and you could get maybe if you don't get two million dollars you get a hundred thousand dollars two hundred thousand dollars fifty thousand dollars twenty five thousand dollars even if you get ten thousand dollars think about that's one month of work or two months of work and is that worth it and it could be really worth it and really significant so web 3 bounties is a massive opportunity i would highly recommend you look into them also obviously if that wasn't clear what i've been saying right now web 3 jobs are also a massive opportunity okay so those are some of the different ones that i think not a lot of people are talking about those are massive ones but i'll go over some other ones that are more kind of obvious than other people have talked about too freelancing is a big one for example if you freelance but if you do it in a different way kind of like i'm sharing with you i think you have much higher opportunities as a freelancer you can make money right and with coding another one that's interesting that not a lot of people talk about is tutoring so you could go on platforms like yzant or takelessons.com or some other ones people will people will pay you to teach them coding and i bet if you could teach people solidity or rust they will pay you twice or three times as much to teach them so let's say that with regular coding you could charge a hundred dollars an hour or fifty dollars an hour if you're teaching somebody solidity you could charge seventy five hundred two hundred three hundred dollars an hour and i bet there are a lot of people willing to pay that so they could learn solidity or rust any of the blockchain web 3 programming languages other ways you can do this and make money is of course you could start your own startup or you can launch your own sas business that's much much harder there's luck involved there's a ton of skill involved and there's a whole like you have to fully learn business and so not everybody's going to have a knack for that obviously that's one of the best places and one of the most lucrative places you know because then you can launch a company like phantom wallet or metamask or something like that and have millions of users and then the world is your oyster essentially that's really hard and rare and so i would say at least build some level of experience as a software developer because to be honest to start a sas company you're not gonna if you don't have background as a software developer you're just gonna throw your money away and not make anything successful and yeah it'll be terrible so i wouldn't start a startup and a sas company on if you don't know software development unless you have a ton of money and you can blow it and not worry about it and you're okay with losing that then you can take a try on it if you don't know software development and you don't have a lot of money i would never recommend starting a sas startup that would be really hard but of course you could try it i don't want to discourage anybody the other one is content creation as a developer which is what i do which is what a ton of other people do whether it's joma tech or programming with mosh or whoever is out there right all these content creators as developers it's very simple generally they make videos that help a ton of people think of us like glorified teachers we are essentially teachers we love teaching i love teaching and we're sharing this with people and then if you get a following big enough you could sell a course you can monetize it with youtube or you could do kind of a little bit of what we're doing which is we're going hey we'll keep a lot of stuff for you for free but then we'll go charge these companies to teach their technology or train you on them and then it's a winwin for everybody the companies win you win and you guys get a ton of free content so it's doesn't matter how you set up your business model you could even do it where you have your channel and then you just like tutor people because you're starting to get a ton of tutoring clients whatever the case may be so when you have your own channel when you ever when you have your own source the amount that what what you could do with it is infinite having a brand is really it's definitely one of the most valuable things you could do but again not everybody enjoys that and that's not everybody's cup of tea but obviously doing content creation is a huge opportunity for developers and a lot of developers have taken to that right traversing media fire ship coder coder and a lot of the coding community i mean forgetting their name that guy that made the stock trading video cal uh cali haldon yeah the list of developer coding channel goes on so those are some of the ways that i've listed out and just to kind of recap talked about freelancing tutoring web three bounties a fulltime job startups and content creation as a dev so we really talked about six different ways my main takeaway for you is don't be a commodity learn something that's more niche that'll make your life a lot easier focus on communication skills because that helps you stand out and that's how you can provide a ton more value in the market and that's how you could charge a ton of more money and then whether you go freelancing or full time those will all give you uh really good chances of being able to make significant amount of money as a developer while enjoying your career again i just want to make sure right you understand none of this is easy this all requires tremendous amount of hard work so understand that you should i'm not going to say must but i'm just going to say you should love it to a certain extent because if you don't i know too many people who are in nighty field that are absolutely miserable with their lives and hate them so i don't want you to be one of them i want you to love your life enjoy your life and make good money as a developer that's it for me i hope
