00:00 - - Hey you, in this video
we're gonna be covering
00:03 - the top five programming languages
00:06 - for you to learn so you
can get a job in 2018
00:09 - without needing a college degree.
00:11 - How we're gonna rank these
programming languages
00:13 - from number five to number
one is based on three things.
00:17 - Number one, the time it
takes for even an absolute
00:20 - beginner to go from just learning
to building practical real
00:23 - world apps and then going on to get a job
00:27 - without even needing a college degree.
00:29 - Number two, the job market.
00:31 - So what is the demand for
these programming languages,
00:34 - what's the average salary
for each developer?
00:36 - And number three, what we're gonna
00:38 - base it off on is productivity.
00:40 - So in terms of development
time, how quickly does it
00:43 - let you bring your ideas to life?
00:45 - This is very important
because when a company is
00:47 - looking to hire you, they
want to make sure that
00:49 - you're very productive in
terms of your development.
00:51 - And if you build things quicker,
00:53 - you're effectively saving
them a lot of cost.
00:56 - What they would pay a
developer two times for,
00:58 - you can do it twice faster
or maybe five times faster.
01:02 - And so they're saving a lot
of money on you which means
01:04 - that they're profitable
on you, which means that
01:06 - they're likely to pay you more.
01:08 - With that said, I hope you are excited
01:11 - and without any further ado,
let's jump right into it.
01:15 - (electronic intro music)
01:26 - Hey, this is Qazi from
cleverprogrammer.com
01:31 - Alright, let's start
with number five: Java.
01:35 - Java is primarily an
object-oriented language
01:39 - and it is a de facto standard,
it's been around forever.
01:44 - And now it's in most companies.
01:46 - The great thing about it is
also that you can build native
01:50 - Android apps using the
Java programming language.
01:54 - Average developer salaries
start at $74,000 a year.
01:58 - The only reason I put
it kind of at the bottom
02:01 - is that the learning curve for
02:03 - somebody who's a beginner,
it's a little bit difficult.
02:06 - So take the simplest example in terms of
02:09 - writing the simplest
program ever, in a bunch of
02:12 - programming languages you can just write
02:14 - one line of code and
it actually does stuff.
02:16 - In Java, you have to
actually know about compiling
02:19 - and classes and command
line and it's not very easy
02:23 - to just run anywhere on the web.
02:26 - So learning curve,
portability, all those things
02:29 - pretty difficult and that's why
02:32 - we're gonna place it on number five.
02:34 - With that said, let's move on.
02:36 - Number four, we've got Swift.
02:39 - Swift, you've probably heard of it.
02:40 - If not, no problem, that's what
I'm here to tell you about.
02:43 - Swift is the programming language
that is used for iOS apps.
02:47 - So iPads, iPods, iPhones.
02:50 - The Swift programming
language and you can use it
02:52 - to build native iOS apps, okay.
02:55 - So think about any app that
you download on your phone,
02:58 - right, like for example Wunderlist.
03:00 - If you download it on your phone,
03:01 - chances are it's written in iOS.
03:04 - If you download it on your
iPhone, that's what I mean.
03:07 - And then if you're using it,
that's what it's made with.
03:11 - Average developer salaries are
starting at $80,000 a year.
03:17 - So great programming language,
03:20 - I see a lot of future in Swift,
03:22 - especially with iPhone kind of, you know,
03:25 - it's going to be around for a long time
03:28 - and iOS apps are not going anywhere
03:30 - and they're very, very
powerful and needed.
03:32 - The only problem is that it
is a little bit difficult
03:36 - to learn and get started with.
03:38 - With that said, let's move on to
03:41 - number three: Ruby on Rails.
03:46 - Now what is Ruby on Rails?
03:48 - It's essentially the
programming language Ruby,
03:51 - but then when you combine
a web development framework
03:55 - on it so that's called
Rails, when you combine them
03:58 - together people call them Ruby on Rails.
04:01 - Ruby on Rails is for
developing web applications.
04:05 - And being able to do
it very, very quickly.
04:08 - So making things like eCommerce
04:10 - stores or something like Twitter.
04:13 - You can make those apps in
Ruby and it's very, very easy.
04:17 - The learning curve is pretty
simple and straightforward.
04:21 - Another great thing about it
is that it reads like English.
04:24 - It almost feels like when
you look at the code,
04:26 - you feel like you're reading
English, you're reading a book.
04:29 - The only reason I'm putting
it on number three is because
04:32 - some of the other programming languages
04:34 - that I'm gonna mention
are actually more popular
04:36 - and higher paid than Ruby.
04:38 - Ruby average developer
makes $74,000 a year.
04:43 - Awesome, with that said let's move on to
04:45 - the next programming language.
04:47 - Number two: JavaScript.
04:51 - This is a very, very hot language
04:53 - and a lot of you are probably
going to be very surprised
04:55 - and I'm probably gonna get a
lot of controversy on this.
04:58 - Like, "Oh my God, JavaScript?!"
04:59 - Okay, let me break it down.
05:01 - JavaScript is an awesome
programming language.
05:03 - Very, very popular, if you
type it in it's gonna come up
05:06 - like as one of the first ones.
05:08 - And you can run it pretty much anywhere.
05:10 - So if you just go to Chrome and
right click and hit inspect,
05:15 - you can see, you can actually even type in
05:18 - JavaScript right there and run it.
05:20 - So you can run it right
inside of your web browser.
05:23 - You don't need anything
installed on your computer
05:25 - and it just runs in the web.
05:27 - And this programming language
is pretty much on all websites
05:31 - or all websites that you visit as well.
05:34 - So it's on Facebook,
and it's gonna be on CNN
05:39 - or wherever you go, Amazon,
05:42 - JavaScript is gonna be there.
05:44 - This is a great programming
language but still
05:48 - because of how JavaScript,
the reason why I would
05:54 - say it's a little bit
difficult to learn and practice
05:57 - is because of also the
reason that it's on the web.
06:01 - There are many, many
different things you can do
06:03 - and many different options and that's
06:05 - what also can be confusing about it,
06:08 - especially when you're
starting to learn coding.
06:11 - You wanna just do stuff and move on
06:13 - and not have to worry about
that, oh there are a hundred
06:15 - different ways to do one thing.
06:19 - And they're now trying to
make it simpler, that's one of
06:23 - their goals, and make
it more standardized.
06:25 - But when it was being made
earlier it was kind of like
06:27 - a project that got done really, really
06:29 - quickly in just a few days
and it became really popular
06:32 - and it turned into JavaScript.
06:34 - And now everybody's using
it and they're like,
06:37 - "Man, this seems like there is no control
06:40 - and we have to make it more modularized
06:42 - and make it more simple
for everybody to follow."
06:45 - For somebody who's just trying
to learn and starting out,
06:48 - JavaScript, I would think about
06:50 - not starting off with right away.
06:52 - Also, great language and
the average salary for
06:56 - developers starts at
$110,000 a year, awesome.
07:03 - Number one...
07:06 - Python.
07:07 - So the reason why I've put
Python on number one is
07:09 - because of mainly three reasons.
07:11 - Number one, it's the easiest
programming language to learn.
07:16 - It's one of the most paid
programming languages.
07:19 - Average salaries start at $116,000 a year.
07:24 - And it's one of the most popular
07:25 - programming language to learn.
07:27 - So the reason why I say
it's easy to learn is that
07:30 - if you look at a lot of
the introductory courses
07:33 - that are being taught in the U.S. even,
07:34 - you'll see that all of them are
shifting to teaching Python.
07:38 - And the reason for that is that it's easy
07:41 - so they want the college students
to start off with Python.
07:44 - But then it can be scaled
and it's very powerful.
07:47 - So to give you an example
of how powerful it is,
07:50 - this platform you might
be watching this video on
07:53 - is YouTube, and YouTube is
built with Python, right.
07:57 - Granted, there are many other
programming languages there
07:59 - as well, but primarily
it's written in Python.
08:02 - Google is written in Python.
08:05 - You have Spotify in Python, Reddit, Quora,
08:09 - Hipmunk, and the list goes on.
08:13 - So this is to show you
that this is not just
08:15 - a beginner programming language,
but then you can scale it
08:18 - and do really real world things with it.
08:21 - And that's really the beauty of it.
08:22 - And you can do anything
from machine learning,
08:25 - so you can create robots
that can think for themselves
08:28 - and do really cool
stuff, to web development
08:30 - and creating apps, sharing
your ideas with the world.
08:34 - You can combine web development
with machine learning.
08:38 - You know, the possibilities
are kind of limitless.
08:41 - Now I don't wanna just talk about it.
08:43 - I wanna show you how easy it is
08:44 - and you don't even need anything
installed to run Python.
08:48 - You can even run it online on web services
08:50 - like Repl.it, okay, so I'm
highlighting that here.
08:53 - And you can do it very simply.
08:55 - So for example, if I want to do something
08:57 - I can do it very easily,
so check this out, okay.
08:59 - YouTube turtle, we have
this, alright let's run it.
09:07 - So I really hope that
you enjoyed this video.
09:10 - These were the top five programming
09:12 - languages and here are their salaries.
09:15 - With that said, if you
are interested in taking
09:18 - your career as a developer to the
09:21 - next level, I have a course coming up.
09:22 - It's called "The Profitable Programmer."
09:24 - It's our flagship course
at Clever Programmer
09:27 - that shows you how to create apps
09:29 - and how to land your first client
09:31 - with Pyhthon in less than 90 days.
09:34 - We show you step-by-step, even
09:35 - if you're a complete beginner.
09:38 - And this course has everything
from the basics of Python
09:42 - to web development to landing clients.
09:45 - If you're interested, I have
the link in the description.
09:47 - And here's the link in the video as well.
09:50 - Go to this page, put in
your name and e-mail,
09:52 - and I will put you on the
VIP wait list for this course
09:56 - and I'll give you a bonus of
showing you my top resources
10:01 - I used to learn programming
in less than three months.
10:06 - And I'll give you all of that for
10:07 - free if you join this list now.
10:11 - That's it for this video,
thank you so much for watching.
