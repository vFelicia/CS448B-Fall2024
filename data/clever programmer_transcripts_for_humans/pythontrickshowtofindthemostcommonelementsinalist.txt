00:00 - hey you how are you doing this is Kazi
00:03 - from clever programmer calm I'm so
00:07 - excited to have you here today we're
00:09 - starting a new series called Python
00:12 - hacks I haven't come up with a name yet
00:15 - okay we're gonna come up with the name
00:16 - later that's how I like to do things
00:18 - also it's been a minute so I wanted to
00:21 - give you some good old coding tutorial
00:24 - value all right and I'm gonna be using
00:26 - this website called repple dot I t2
00:29 - codon and the reason is that you don't
00:32 - actually have to have Python installed
00:33 - and you can you can choose to follow me
00:36 - here or in your local Python you're
00:39 - gonna be learning how to find the most
00:40 - common elements in a Python list let's
00:44 - jump right into it so first we're gonna
00:48 - start with a little obfuscated example
00:51 - and then we're gonna move on to kind of
00:52 - more of a real-world example so let's
00:55 - say I gave you this list over here it
00:58 - has Apple show up twice it has ginger
01:00 - show up about four times if I ask you to
01:04 - create an array or a list with tuples in
01:09 - it in descending order of what item is
01:11 - found how many times so for example it
01:15 - should look like this you should have a
01:17 - list and it should have these pairs and
01:20 - it should say Apple is two times and
01:24 - then because ginger shows up more times
01:27 - than Apple it should actually have it
01:29 - here with that
01:32 - alright so in descending order and it
01:35 - should show all of these if I asked you
01:38 - to write code like that why don't you go
01:41 - ahead pause the video and give that
01:44 - challenge to try and then once you're
01:47 - done unpause I'm gonna give you the
01:48 - shortcut way of doing this here's what
01:53 - we're gonna do we're gonna go from
01:55 - collections boom import counter now this
01:58 - is a little cool stuff that the advanced
02:01 - cool kids of Python are doing nowadays
02:03 - and I don't know why it's green but
02:08 - we're just gonna ignore that
02:09 - so we're importing counter
02:12 - and then what I'm going to do is I'm
02:16 - gonna say counter thingy and I'm gonna
02:18 - take my groceries and I'm gonna turn it
02:21 - into a counter object alright I'm gonna
02:25 - go to the end of this guy and we're
02:27 - gonna do it like that so that now the
02:29 - green thing went away because we're
02:31 - using what we have imported and now what
02:35 - I'll say is I'll just say print counter
02:38 - thingy dot most common and I'm just
02:42 - gonna do that and when I print it boom
02:45 - look at that so it's saying it's telling
02:50 - me exactly what I wanted to know in
02:52 - descending order it's a list of tuples
02:54 - or pairs and it goes okay ginger for x
02:57 - banana three times apple two times how
02:59 - freakin cool is that now let's take it a
03:02 - step further what if we only wanted to
03:04 - find the top one thing so we're gonna do
03:07 - pretty much the same thing except for
03:09 - most common we're gonna pass it and say
03:11 - one so now notice notice that it's only
03:18 - showing me that one item whichever one
03:21 - is the most common what if there were
03:23 - two most common items well it would just
03:25 - pick and on at random okay if there was
03:28 - a tie now let's have a little bit of a
03:32 - real-world case scenario here right what
03:35 - it what would I want what is another
03:38 - thing we want to use this most frequent
03:41 - thing for to find the most frequent
03:44 - items why would we want to do such a
03:46 - thing
03:46 - how about if you want to create a word
03:49 - counter and you want to count how many
03:53 - times after each word occurs on the page
03:55 - okay so you want to be able to look at
03:58 - the word the how many times does showed
04:00 - up how many times another word showed up
04:03 - right so how would you do that well
04:05 - let's go through it okay so we have I'm
04:10 - gonna go and copy this guy sentence from
04:14 - my notes and I'm we're gonna paste it
04:17 - right over here cool so now I have this
04:21 - big sentence over here and I want to be
04:25 - able to just
04:26 - loops go through this and print out how
04:29 - many times essentially create a list of
04:32 - tuples or a list of pairs and it should
04:37 - be in descending order telling me which
04:38 - word is showing up how many times
04:41 - alright let's get to it
04:43 - so first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
04:44 - say sentence dot split so what that
04:46 - should do is split it by spaces and some
04:52 - other stuff like comma
04:53 - periods and question marks and it should
04:58 - give me back so it's gonna be a
04:59 - three-step process okay first we're
05:02 - gonna turn it into a list of words then
05:08 - we're going to turn it into a counter
05:18 - counter object okay and then kind of
05:23 - like third we're gonna show the most
05:29 - frequent words all right so this is me
05:39 - doing step one over here so sentence I
05:43 - split
05:43 - let's go to the end this is another cool
05:46 - trick that if you didn't know it I'm not
05:48 - uncommon this out and here you can see
05:52 - that we're essentially getting back a
05:54 - list of words which is what we wanted
05:56 - now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna feed
05:59 - this to my encounter object alright so
06:03 - what I'll say over here is I'll say
06:07 - counter
06:13 - okay and I'm gonna call it words like
06:23 - that okay and let's just print it out
06:26 - and we'll say most common so now that's
06:31 - basically step three and when I run it
06:35 - right you can see that it's giving me
06:38 - back a list of tuples in descending
06:40 - order and it's going okay it showed up
06:42 - seven times I showed up four times how
06:44 - three to two so on and so forth and
06:47 - everything that showed up only once now
06:50 - what if you wanted to go ahead and
06:52 - actually turn it into a dictionary like
06:54 - a regular dictionary so basically you
06:56 - want you want to say hey is is the key
06:59 - and then seven is the value I is the key
07:01 - and four is the value well that's also
07:03 - really really easy all you need to do is
07:06 - just call dick or dictionary on that
07:10 - same thing okay and then we're just
07:13 - gonna print it and I'm gonna comment
07:16 - this out and that's it we got the
07:19 - dictionary so that was just a little tip
07:21 - on how to use counter how to find the
07:24 - most frequent and common elements in a
07:26 - Python list that's it for this video
07:28 - thank you so much for watching and if
07:30 - you want access to this file I have
07:33 - linked it in the description of this
07:35 - YouTube video so just go ahead and click
07:36 - that save it all the notes are yours you
07:39 - can play around with this exact file and
07:42 - learn at your own pace that's it thank
07:45 - you so much for watching this is Kazi I
07:47 - love your face and as always I'll see
07:49 - you in the next video
