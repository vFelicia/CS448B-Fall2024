00:00 - - Hey guys, what's up? How's it going?
00:01 - This is Qazi from CleverProgrammer.com.
00:06 - In this video, what I wanna talk about
00:08 - is should I use and learn Scratch
00:12 - before jumping onto Python?
00:14 - So, without any further ado,
let's jump right into it.
00:19 - (bouncy music)
00:31 - All right guys, this is
a very important thing
00:35 - that we are going to be
answering in this video
00:37 - and another cool thing we're doing today
00:39 - is actually I am live
on Instagram right now
00:44 - and we have people
watching this on Instagram
00:47 - and what I did is I went live,
00:49 - got this on one of the video ideas
00:51 - from the people on Instagram
00:53 - and then I'm making this
live there and doing it here,
00:55 - so it's the first time,
we'll see how it goes,
00:56 - but let's jump into it.
00:57 - So, should you use and learn Scratch
01:00 - before learning Python?
01:02 - Now here's how I would
answer this question, okay?
01:05 - There's a long way to go
by, a short way to go by.
01:07 - I'll try to give you the short way
01:08 - and then I'll expound on it.
01:10 - I would suggest, if you have extra time,
01:13 - that you do use Scratch
before jumping onto Python.
01:17 - That is if you have extra time.
01:19 - So here's why I say that.
01:22 - Scratch is a visual programming language
01:25 - and it's made by MIT,
specifically for kids.
01:27 - Now, when something is made for kids,
01:29 - it doesn't mean that if
you're over the age of five,
01:32 - you shouldn't use it
01:33 - or if you're over the age of 15 or 20, 21,
01:36 - you shouldn't use it.
01:37 - It just means that it's very simple.
01:40 - So when you're starting something
01:41 - that you're new to, it's a very good idea
01:46 - to have it start off very simple.
01:50 - Then you can go on and
add more and more and more
01:53 - and more complexity to it,
and become better at it.
01:56 - But in the start, if you try to start off
01:58 - a little bit too advanced,
you're gonna convolute things.
02:00 - That's why it's gonna get really muddy
02:02 - and you're gonna get very, very confused.
02:05 - So that's the same reason
why I suggest people
02:07 - to start off with Python, and
the reason why I say Python
02:10 - is because I know a
lot of people are busy,
02:12 - they have jobs and they
can't find a lot of time,
02:15 - so Python is the perfect intersection
02:17 - of something where you can be very busy,
02:21 - have little time and learn,
02:23 - and it's still very a popular language
02:25 - because YouTube is made of off Python,
02:27 - Instagram is made of off Python,
02:29 - where I'm actually live right now.
02:30 - Spotify, Reddit, I could go on all day,
02:32 - those are all made of off Python.
02:34 - Now, they're not made from Scratch,
02:37 - so Scratch will have its limitations.
02:39 - So if you're short on time,
Python is the way to go
02:42 - but if you have a little
bit of extra time,
02:44 - you wanna put in those extra weekends
02:46 - and start of with something
02:48 - before maybe even jumping
onto something like Python
02:50 - or something more serious,
02:52 - Scratch is great, great,
great to start off with
02:55 - because you can visually
move blocks of code
02:59 - and understand how if-then statements work
03:01 - and you can see it visually happening.
03:06 - You can visually understand
how while loops work
03:09 - or how for loops work
03:11 - because you can visually use your mouse
03:14 - to move it around and actually
see the things happening
03:16 - in the form of maybe
animations or whatnot,
03:18 - and there are tons of
Scratch resources online,
03:21 - lessons online, YouTube
videos online for free
03:24 - that can help you get started.
03:25 - So yeah, Scratch is a
great place to start.
03:30 - I highly recommend it.
03:32 - And never try to put yourself
like you're above something,
03:35 - like, "Oh, I've done this
coding language for one month
03:38 - "and so I'm above Scratch."
03:40 - It's very good to go a few steps lower,
03:43 - really learn the
fundamentals really strongly,
03:46 - and then when you are going up your limit,
03:51 - you will be unbounded
how far up you can go.
03:55 - Whereas if you have
really weak fundamentals,
03:57 - you'll be very, very, very bounded.
04:00 - You'll have crazy limits
to where you can improve.
04:03 - Those are the same people, when
they get hired by companies,
04:06 - people hate working with them.
04:08 - They're like, "John is an idiot."
04:10 - No offense if there's a John watching this
04:11 - but they're like, "John is an idiot."
04:14 - Because John got this job,
04:15 - he had the knowledge, he got this job,
04:17 - but now John can improve, John
can learn new things fast,
04:21 - John primarily works off
of like rote memorization
04:24 - and the things that he just
04:25 - kind of like new and picked up on,
04:27 - but not new problems that he could solve
04:29 - because his building blocks
in his foundation was weak.
04:32 - So Scratch will give you a
very, very strong foundation
04:35 - to start off from, and
everything you'll be doing
04:37 - later in programming languages
04:38 - will make a lot more
intuitive sense to you.
04:41 - And whenever something
makes more intuitive sense,
04:43 - that's when you can get
really, really good at it.
04:45 - That's why when kids start
04:47 - and they get started
very young at something
04:49 - and just start of with the very basics,
04:52 - that's why they become so good
that nobody can match them.
04:55 - It's not because they started off
04:56 - with some high-level theory
or a textbook at their school
04:58 - or at their college or whatever.
05:01 - It was because they started off
05:03 - with these really, really,
really baby basic building blocks
05:07 - and spent a lot of time with them
05:09 - and that's why when they
start getting better at it,
05:11 - they just smoke even old people,
05:13 - even really intelligent people.
05:16 - Their neuroplasticity
level is also much higher
05:19 - when they're younger, but
even regardless of that,
05:21 - they just learn a lot faster
and it's for that reason
05:23 - 'cause they just spend and play around
05:25 - with the basics so much.
05:27 - So if you spend time playing
around with something,
05:31 - it's gonna be a lot more intuitive to you
05:33 - and you're gonna get a
lot better at it faster.
05:36 - And this rule that I have,
which is play, build, learn,
05:40 - it's my 80/15/5 rule
instead of 80/20 rule.
05:44 - So, 80% of your time should be
spent playing with something
05:48 - in order to learn it if
you wanna learn a new skill
05:50 - and get better at it.
05:51 - 15% of your time should
be building things with,
05:55 - so building projects or real
things you can show people.
05:58 - So if you're learning Scratch,
06:00 - 80% time is just like messing
around, toying around with it,
06:03 - 15% of the time should be spent
06:05 - maybe building a project with it
06:09 - or building a little fun game with it,
06:10 - and then 5% of the time
06:12 - should be spent just watching tutorials
06:14 - and taking down notes
and actually learning.
06:17 - That way, you'll learn so much faster
06:20 - and then you'll also have
a lot more motivation
06:21 - to sit through and learn
06:23 - 'cause if you have no relevant experience
06:25 - and you sit down to learn something,
06:27 - it's very boring because it
doesn't connect with you.
06:29 - Like imagine you never kicked
a soccer ball in your life
06:32 - and then you started taking a class
06:34 - and the class starts off,
a teacher standing there
06:37 - on the blackboard and he's
like, "Okay, step one.
06:41 - "Step one, you're going to..."
06:44 - So the way that teachers teach you,
06:46 - it's really, really boring
06:47 - because they're just writing down notes
06:49 - on a blackboard or something like that.
06:52 - And if you're learning
something like soccer
06:53 - and that's how you start
off, is it gonna be 1) fun,
06:56 - but even forget fun, is
it gonna be relevant?
06:59 - Is it gonna be helpful?
07:00 - It's not even gonna be helpful.
07:01 - It's just gonna be a pure waste of time.
07:02 - What's a lot better to learn soccer?
07:04 - Kick the ball, play around
with it, 80% of your day,
07:08 - spend 15% of the day just
making up random tricks
07:10 - that don't even make sense,
07:12 - and then 5% of the time actually
watching a tutorial video
07:16 - or actually watch a teacher give you notes
07:18 - on how to make a play, what
different positions called,
07:23 - your LW, CB, center back, all that.
07:25 - Then what happens, everything makes sense.
07:27 - It's fun.
07:28 - The reason why it's fun
07:29 - is because it's so, so, so
highly, highly relevant.
07:33 - So, not to go on a
tangent but let's go back.
07:36 - That's why I think that
if you have extra time
07:39 - and you wanna start off with Scratch
07:40 - before you get into another
programming language
07:43 - like Python or Java or JavaScript
07:46 - or C or C++ or whatever,
07:50 - I think it's a very good idea.
07:52 - Hopefully that answers it for you guys.
07:54 - Hopefully I didn't miss anything.
07:56 - If I did, please comment down
07:58 - and let me know if you enjoyed this video
08:01 - that was very hard to make.
08:02 - My arm is very tired
08:04 - and my friend who's helping
08:05 - to hold the camera is very tired too.
08:06 - If you enjoyed this video,
please give it a thumbs up.
08:09 - If you disliked it, then dislike it
08:11 - but I do want you to take action.
08:12 - Please don't just leave it ignored.

08:17 - Hit that bell button so you
can get all the notifications,
08:20 - comment, and other than that,
08:22 - thank you so much for watching.
08:23 - As always, I love your faces off
08:26 - and I'll see you in the next video.
