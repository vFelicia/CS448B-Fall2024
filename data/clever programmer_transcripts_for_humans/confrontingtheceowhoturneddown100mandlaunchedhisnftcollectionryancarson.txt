00:00 - what is the biggest loss you've
00:01 - experienced in let's say a business or
00:03 - something along those lines i mean uh
00:06 - you know i've missed deals
00:09 - that are worth 100 million dollars
00:11 - some big ones come by sometimes and you
00:12 - miss them you know
00:14 - but you can't i mean you know
00:16 - hindsight's 20 20. um yeah it's a good
00:18 - lesson to learn
00:19 - [Music]
00:21 - what it is facing emerge
00:24 - that i can't pick it up
00:26 - what's up guys how's it going this is
00:27 - quasi from clever programmer today we
00:29 - have ryan carson on our podcast and
00:34 - some of you might actually know him a
00:36 - lot of you will know him when i tell you
00:37 - one of the companies that he's actually
00:38 - founded but he is the founder of
00:40 - personified drops and and team treehouse
00:45 - over the last 22 years he's the ceo and
00:47 - founder of three companies and one
00:49 - non-profit and he's helped over 600 000
00:52 - people learn how to co code okay so that
00:54 - is pretty epic for a lot of you who know
00:56 - team treehouse drop it in the comments
00:58 - below i'm very excited and grateful that
01:01 - he took his time to be on this podcast
01:03 - and i got a lot of questions for him
01:05 - because he's now jumping into the web 3
01:06 - space and i want to know what he knows
01:09 - and hopefully bring you guys that value
01:10 - so with that said i'm gonna shut my
01:12 - mouth
01:13 - ryan welcome on board qazi it is good to
01:16 - be here i've respected you for a long
01:19 - time what you built it's a lot of fun to
01:21 - talk shop so let's get to it
01:24 - awesome man so thanks for jumping on
01:26 - here
01:27 - i mean a lot has happened since we even
01:29 - last spoke you know which was a a week
01:32 - ago and then before that a few years ago
01:36 - uh we spoke you know talk to me kind of
01:38 - where you're at right now because i know
01:40 - that i think you you've sold you've
01:43 - exited team treehouse and so kind of
01:45 - talk to me what led to
01:48 - led to you doing that you bet um
01:51 - so i started uh treehouse more than a
01:54 - decade ago and uh you know the reason
01:57 - why is because i got a computer science
01:59 - degree and then i got a job
02:01 - and then i realized uh you didn't need
02:03 - the computer science degree um and a lot
02:06 - of people were being held out you know
02:08 - outside of the industry
02:10 - for no good reason and so the thought
02:12 - was hey let's let's launch an affordable
02:14 - accessible school
02:16 - and um
02:18 - and
02:19 - i loved being able to do that you know
02:22 - building treehouse
02:23 - um and empowering over 600 000 people
02:26 - to get better jobs to build wealth for
02:29 - their families
02:30 - is the most meaningful work i've ever
02:32 - done um and i'm so grateful i was able
02:34 - to be a part of that yeah you know
02:36 - through that journey it was my third
02:38 - company uh learned a lot you know um
02:41 - about how to be a ceo um
02:44 - how to run a large organization you know
02:47 - made some mistakes learned a lot through
02:49 - the way
02:50 - and in the end
02:52 - i it felt like it was time for
02:55 - a new owner of treehouse to come in and
02:57 - take it to the next level and
03:00 - found a wonderful choir
03:02 - that came in and and is going to take
03:05 - treehouse to that next level and then i
03:06 - was able to step back
03:08 - and and just kind of breathe for a
03:10 - minute um so
03:12 - so the interesting thing was um my very
03:15 - first investor
03:16 - is a guy named kevin rose
03:18 - and he started a site called dig a long
03:22 - time ago
03:24 - and really became a well-known investor
03:28 - founder and he was my first investor
03:31 - and so he and i have known each other
03:32 - for almost 15 years now
03:34 - um
03:35 - and and so when this was you know when
03:37 - when my treehouse journey was kind of
03:38 - winding down
03:40 - um
03:41 - uh he and i were messaging each other
03:42 - and he said hey i've started this
03:44 - podcast uh called modern finance yeah
03:48 - it's all it's all about blockchain and
03:50 - and it's about crypto and and he said
03:52 - you should give it a listen um and you
03:54 - know i had paid attention a little bit
03:57 - to blockchain i
03:58 - um back i think it must have been
04:01 - gosh i don't remember when but when
04:03 - mount gox was out i bought some bitcoin
04:06 - you know
04:06 - it was hard and confusing and
04:09 - kind of forgot about it and then yeah
04:11 - box got hacked and i lost all my bitcoin
04:13 - and i just kind of gave up you know i
04:15 - just thought damn how many bitcoin i
04:17 - don't i don't know and i don't want to
04:18 - find out because it's just gonna make me
04:20 - sad
04:21 - um but you know so i like everyone i
04:24 - just thought i don't really get it you
04:25 - know i lost my money i'm just yeah i'm
04:28 - just gonna move on um so i hadn't really
04:30 - thought much about
04:32 - crypto blockchain
04:34 - anything um until kevin sort of said hey
04:36 - you should pay attention
04:38 - and so
04:39 - as my treehouse journey was winding down
04:41 - i began to listen to his podcast
04:44 - and i just you know listened every
04:46 - single episode and i i think
04:49 - as i was listening to it
04:51 - it's just
04:52 - like the light bulb went off
04:54 - and i just knew oh like
04:57 - this is bigger can you can you get
04:59 - everything can you give me some insight
05:01 - into what were some of the things that
05:03 - maybe kevin rose said on his podcast
05:05 - that made you go
05:06 - that clicked because for a lot of people
05:09 - the click is missing you know they're
05:10 - not they're like i can see you can send
05:13 - money
05:14 - uh and i can see you can get rug pulled
05:17 - but like
05:18 - what's the what's the
05:20 - right because a lot of developers
05:22 - think okay is it just hype or is this
05:24 - reality
05:25 - what's happening so what were some of
05:27 - the things that you would say for you
05:29 - clicked or kind of went aha like you had
05:32 - that aha moment so the first thing was
05:34 - was the very first podcast um the guest
05:37 - his name was dc investor and he talked
05:39 - about nfts and i didn't understand what
05:41 - an nft was so so as i was listening to
05:43 - that episode i was driving in my car he
05:45 - explained you know how can a digital
05:48 - item
05:50 - have
05:51 - a unique owner you know how does that
05:53 - work you know because it's so
05:55 - anti-intuitive
05:56 - right right i think well can i just
05:58 - right click save like i don't understand
06:00 - how someone can own a digital asset
06:03 - and so as he explained it and how nfts
06:06 - work and how you can prove you know the
06:08 - provenance and the owner of a digital
06:10 - asset i think that's when i went oh my
06:12 - god this will change everything because
06:15 - as soon as i realized oh you know
06:17 - digital assets can be unique and and the
06:21 - ownership can be proven you know all the
06:23 - alarm bells started going off i started
06:25 - thinking about wait a minute you know
06:27 - that means every industry is going to
06:30 - change so it wasn't even about jpegs it
06:32 - was this idea of you know well why isn't
06:35 - your the deed to your house in nft you
06:38 - know
06:39 - that should be the case this should live
06:41 - on the blockchain yeah
06:43 - you know and as soon as that started
06:45 - happening i realized oh my god this is
06:47 - going to change everything
06:48 - and then then it was a process of like
06:50 - learning you know and at first i didn't
06:52 - understand at all
06:54 - so i just started learning and watching
06:56 - youtube videos and i think that's when
06:57 - it became clear
06:59 - that a decentralized global computer
07:02 - that can uh never be changed it you know
07:06 - once the state is set will will change
07:08 - the world because wow
07:10 - you then can separate everything else
07:13 - from these walled vertical gardens that
07:15 - we lived in and then i was just like all
07:16 - in you know it's almost like it became
07:18 - my religion wow that's powerful
07:21 - you know i guess like some of the
07:23 - questions that i remember i used to have
07:24 - so i'll ask them because i know a lot of
07:26 - people on our platform are beginner
07:28 - software developers or maybe have some
07:30 - years of experience but still might be
07:31 - considering it is like when you're
07:33 - looking into and you're like okay i can
07:34 - own an asset so i remember playing you
07:37 - know let's say i played this game called
07:39 - borderlands a long time ago right yeah
07:41 - and now
07:42 - and back in those days they had come up
07:44 - with this new concept of dlcs
07:46 - downloadable content yeah and games just
07:48 - blew up because you just buy all these
07:50 - you know i was buying like when i was
07:52 - playing fifa i was buying messi and all
07:54 - these big players and all these cards
07:55 - and so they were like what you would
07:56 - call an nft card but like i was getting
07:59 - access to messi and i'm like i'm able to
08:01 - prove that i own that and not other
08:03 - people own it because well i bought it
08:05 - it's in my account and when ryan logs
08:07 - into his account he doesn't have it
08:09 - in my mind
08:10 - yeah so doesn't that already mean i have
08:13 - digital ownership you know just like
08:15 - i'll buy a movie i own it you go into
08:18 - your amazon account you don't have it
08:19 - but i have it so i feel like i already
08:21 - have digital ownership what is this
08:23 - digital ownership
08:25 - well the can you sell that messy no
08:28 - so
08:29 - this is the problem right so you don't
08:31 - own anything um
08:33 - this is the great web 2 trick right so
08:36 - we have all these walled gardens right
08:38 - so um you know or gaming platforms you
08:41 - know for instance
08:43 - um you think that you bought that dlc
08:45 - and you own it and it's a flex like you
08:47 - know when you're in the game people can
08:49 - see you have you know a jersey or a
08:52 - player wow you know kazi's got this
08:54 - expensive player respect
08:56 - and then and then and then you actually
08:58 - realize you don't own anything because
09:00 - as soon as you want to take that value
09:02 - out of the game you can't um and so this
09:05 - is the key right so
09:07 - nfts are composable so what that means
09:10 - is if you own a digital asset you own it
09:13 - everywhere right so it's not locked into
09:16 - a vertical garden so for instance if
09:18 - you're on facebook right now yeah um and
09:22 - uh
09:23 - you
09:24 - have a certain number of followers for
09:26 - instance yeah you can't take those
09:28 - followers anywhere else right you don't
09:30 - you don't own them um
09:32 - and so
09:33 - what what everybody is realizing is that
09:36 - if i can digitally own an asset then i
09:38 - actually digitally own it like yeah and
09:40 - that means i can take that asset i can
09:42 - sell it to anybody so a good example
09:45 - makes sense
09:46 - is so there's these
09:48 - games that are coming out now
09:50 - um you know a good example is uh axi
09:53 - infinity have you heard of that yeah
09:55 - yeah i've heard of it it's like the
09:57 - biggest one right they're doing like 200
09:59 - billion dollars a week like something
10:00 - ridiculous like that i remember when i
10:02 - saw it i was like whoa their market cap
10:04 - was huge too yeah so so for those of you
10:07 - that are listening that are trying to
10:08 - understand this you know a game like axi
10:11 - launched and what happens is you go on
10:13 - to the game and you have to buy
10:16 - your axi which is an animal and think of
10:19 - it as pokemon so you have these animals
10:21 - and they battle each other they're
10:22 - called axes
10:23 - but in order to play you have to buy an
10:25 - axi
10:26 - um
10:27 - now what if you can't afford the axi
10:30 - um uh well let me let me back up so you
10:32 - buy an axi yeah um and they can be
10:35 - expensive you know i i don't actually
10:37 - know right now how much an axi trades
10:38 - for but say it's 500 bucks
10:41 - it's a lot of money um and so say you
10:44 - came on and you bought an axi you then
10:46 - battle it with other axes and if it wins
10:49 - then you unlock uh
10:51 - slp or smooth love potion
10:53 - and smooth love potion if you make
10:55 - enough of it it allows you to mint or
10:58 - create another axi so also you're able
11:01 - to create something that is worth 500
11:04 - by winning
11:05 - so it's like oh wait a minute so by
11:08 - playing this game i can actually create
11:09 - an asset that is inherently valuable
11:12 - so i started off with one axis 500 bucks
11:15 - i battled a bunch i won and i was able
11:17 - to create another one and all sudden i
11:19 - made back my initial 500 well
11:22 - now i've got two axes why don't i keep
11:24 - battling right and then you unlock more
11:26 - slp and then you
11:28 - then you mint another axi and also
11:31 - you've made 500 net so yeah and now the
11:34 - the crazy thing so this is the exciting
11:36 - thing yeah well that's great that i have
11:38 - 500 but can i actually have the 500
11:40 - please yes what you do is you take your
11:43 - slp
11:44 - you go to uni swap and you swap it for
11:47 - us dollars
11:49 - so
11:51 - yeah this is the connection like you
11:53 - actually own that asset and you can
11:56 - extract the us dollars or canadian
11:58 - dollars or british pounds or
12:01 - whatever so you're
12:03 - web 2 was a big trick like basically and
12:06 - i was you know all of us got tricked
12:08 - like we
12:09 - ended up working very hard
12:11 - on other people's platforms to build
12:14 - value for them
12:16 - i see
12:17 - you know so you're working really hard
12:18 - on youtube and and you know youtube uh
12:22 - you're getting you know
12:24 - ad revenue off that you're getting
12:26 - followers off that and subscribers but
12:28 - the truth is you don't own anything um
12:31 - yeah you know you're a digital surf on
12:33 - their on their kingdom
12:36 - and so this is the big switch is is like
12:38 - actually owning the content now yes
12:41 - there's a ton of scammers and yes
12:42 - there's a bunch a bunch of rug pulls and
12:44 - but this happened when e-commerce
12:46 - launched in web one right everybody
12:51 - was scared about putting your credit
12:53 - card in a website ah yeah yeah yeah
12:56 - that's true yeah this is like
12:58 - 2001 right so yeah you know of course
13:01 - people are afraid and of course there
13:03 - were scammers
13:05 - but that doesn't mean the platform was
13:07 - bad or that it was inherently
13:10 - evil all it was was technology was
13:12 - advancing so
13:14 - i think that's what's happening with
13:15 - web3 got it wow uh this is really cool
13:18 - like even it reminds me of i i started
13:21 - doing this options trading one time
13:24 - and um i went into this platform and
13:26 - then i won some money and then i tried
13:28 - to take it out and they just like locked
13:30 - it and i couldn't take it out and i was
13:31 - like [ __ ] and i was freaking out because
13:34 - you didn't own it
13:35 - right and this happened with me even one
13:37 - time with a long time ago i don't know
13:40 - if it was coinbase or no it was like
13:41 - some other service i was using and i was
13:43 - trying to sell my bitcoin because they
13:46 - were going down that day and i couldn't
13:48 - they locked it yeah and so that was
13:50 - super frustrating but it feels like with
13:52 - this that that's not really likely to
13:54 - happen because i own it right so i can
13:56 - you own it and nobody nobody can stop
14:00 - you from sending it or or trading it
14:03 - or or using it so so so take this for
14:07 - instance so uh one of the big now look
14:09 - when we say web3 what we're talking
14:11 - about is a couple of different things
14:12 - right we're talking about blockchains
14:15 - so what is web3 i guess just so
14:17 - everybody can understand so we're saying
14:18 - web 2 web 3 web one
14:20 - what is web3 ryan so
14:23 - web3 is
14:25 - a group
14:27 - of technology technological innovations
14:30 - put together so it's number one
14:33 - blockchains right so we have
14:35 - these global
14:37 - um
14:38 - immutable
14:39 - databases called blockchains right so so
14:42 - bitcoin was was the first right yeah um
14:45 - and and
14:46 - and then on ethereum launched after that
14:50 - right um these are both proof of work
14:52 - which means that you have these
14:54 - computers that
14:55 - compete for the right to be able to save
14:58 - these block chains and then they get
14:59 - rewarded for that
15:01 - it's expensive and and bad for the
15:03 - environment so
15:05 - so
15:06 - now the blockchains are moving to what's
15:07 - called proof of stake
15:09 - which is not energy intensive it's very
15:11 - green and so
15:13 - you have blockchain so that's number one
15:15 - and so bitcoin was was the first
15:18 - and
15:20 - you can't build applications on top of
15:22 - bitcoin right there's no smart contracts
15:24 - there is there's something now called
15:26 - stacks which you can but it's new so so
15:29 - bitcoin is really just a ledger that you
15:32 - can write transactions to and data to
15:34 - great it also has a token called bitcoin
15:36 - so it's a little confusing that the
15:38 - network is called bitcoin and the
15:40 - token's called bitcoin got it then the
15:43 - then the the next layer one launch which
15:46 - is ethereum
15:47 - yeah
15:48 - it has the ability to write smart
15:50 - contracts so you can now
15:52 - program on top of this network right so
15:55 - yeah you're going to hear terms like
15:56 - solidity which is a programming language
15:58 - that you write smart contracts and and
16:00 - smart contracts is just another word for
16:02 - programs
16:03 - um yeah yeah yeah so
16:06 - a lot of your viewers have maybe tried
16:08 - learning solidity if if you all haven't
16:10 - do it um yeah there's so much demand for
16:14 - facility developers it's it's just crazy
16:16 - so that's blockchains now
16:19 - the next thing you have on top of that
16:21 - is something called defy or
16:23 - decentralized finance
16:24 - so once you have blockchains
16:26 - and people have the right to interact
16:29 - directly with each other without
16:31 - anybody's permission right so
16:34 - for instance as soon as i have ether in
16:38 - my metamask wallet and you have ether in
16:40 - your metamask wallet we can transact
16:43 - with each other and we don't have to get
16:45 - permission from any government
16:47 - any bank or anybody yeah
16:50 - that's called permissionless or
16:52 - trustless we don't have to trust each
16:54 - other right because
16:56 - code
16:57 - is what combines us right so as soon as
17:00 - you can transact
17:02 - then you can do decentralized finance
17:04 - now
17:05 - the reason why this is so exciting is
17:06 - because we used to have to go you know
17:09 - to the nasdaq or to our bank
17:12 - or or to paypal and say can i please
17:15 - send this person and they'd say well i
17:17 - don't know tell me where you live first
17:19 - you know tell me who you are
17:20 - um you know
17:22 - uh let's i don't know if you can send
17:24 - that much money today you know
17:26 - and there's all these controls around
17:28 - you and some of them are good um
17:31 - but as soon as you have decentralized
17:33 - permissionless trustless
17:35 - uh transaction then you can do d5 so a
17:37 - good example of defy
17:39 - is
17:40 - if i have you know one ether
17:42 - yeah and you have three thousand dollars
17:47 - yeah and we want to trade that
17:49 - yeah you know how do we do it without a
17:51 - bank or without coinbase so
17:54 - what you do is you go to sushi swap or
17:57 - uniswap
17:59 - and there's this amazing bit of code
18:01 - called an automatic automated market
18:03 - maker which
18:04 - will allow us to trade tokens with each
18:07 - other that trustlessly
18:09 - and it's amazing it's just code you know
18:12 - yeah and it doesn't
18:14 - you don't have to worry like do i have
18:16 - the ether and do you have the us dollars
18:18 - you know because either you do you don't
18:20 - and if if you do then you can trade um
18:23 - wow yeah so d5 is a big part of web3
18:27 - yeah yeah and then you have nfts so nfts
18:32 - it's they're a standard it's called erc
18:34 - 721 or erc
18:36 - 1155 and what that is is you know
18:39 - digital ownership of assets and people
18:42 - are fixated right now on you know punks
18:44 - or apes or
18:46 - or or jpegs but this is not where this
18:48 - is not the true power of nfts yeah right
18:52 - the true power is any asset in the world
18:54 - is going to be on the blockchain right
18:56 - so anything you can own
18:58 - will eventually be on the blockchain so
19:00 - you combine these things together
19:02 - um
19:03 - and
19:04 - the whole world's going to change um i
19:06 - mean i've i've been around to see web
19:08 - one web two and uh i'm i'm all in like i
19:12 - know that this is where the future is
19:14 - going
19:15 - and it's we're super early
19:17 - right but it's very very exciting which
19:19 - is why everybody says good morning right
19:21 - yeah
19:22 - because we're really yeah it took me a
19:24 - second to learn that on twitter why is
19:26 - this happening what is everybody saying
19:28 - right so
19:29 - look right you're retired
19:32 - right
19:33 - you
19:34 - but what that basically means is you
19:36 - have money to lift for the rest of your
19:37 - life
19:39 - why work and why do why are you doing
19:41 - something with web3 right now
19:43 - it's just so
19:44 - exciting it's so exciting i mean the
19:48 - the the most important thing um so you
19:51 - know maslow's hierarchy right so at the
19:54 - base level you need to be able to
19:55 - survive right you need to be able to
19:57 - have shelter i need to be able to eat
19:59 - yeah and then
20:00 - as soon as that base layer of maslow's
20:03 - hierarchy is filled then you can move up
20:05 - and say okay now i can feed myself and i
20:07 - have shelter okay now i want to start
20:09 - earning enough money that i can save
20:11 - money right so i can plan for the future
20:13 - once you can do that and you move up the
20:15 - next level yeah and
20:17 - then once you can save enough then the
20:19 - next goal is to become independently
20:21 - wealthy okay have enough money that that
20:23 - my money works for me and pays me right
20:26 - yeah um but that's
20:28 - that's not what makes people ultimately
20:30 - happy what makes people happy is having
20:32 - purpose yeah um and and doing something
20:36 - um that makes you feel useful
20:39 - yeah and so in the end i i just
20:41 - um saw was happening with web3
20:44 - um you know my good friend kevin you
20:46 - know had started proof um
20:49 - this
20:50 - exciting project and i just thought i
20:52 - want to be a part of that you know i
20:54 - want to be a part of part of a team um
20:57 - got it and it's just so much fun like
20:59 - i'm actually
21:00 - working too much because i can't stop
21:02 - myself and i was on twitter doing a
21:04 - twitter spaces last night until
21:06 - until like 11 30. i'm like i need to go
21:08 - to bed like what am i doing oh that's
21:10 - sick
21:11 - that's awesome
21:12 - that's awesome i'd love to hop in there
21:14 - next time
21:16 - yeah that is super cool so i guess talk
21:19 - to me about what is happening in this
21:21 - right so you jump into this you're
21:23 - interested you're like i want to do this
21:25 - one thing before we get into kind of
21:27 - what you're doing with proof is if if
21:30 - you're a developer
21:32 - what is why should a web 2 developer
21:34 - move into and do stuff with web 3. okay
21:39 - the the reason why is you need to
21:42 - skate where the puck is going okay
21:44 - so um
21:46 - and you want to be joining companies
21:48 - that are truly innovating right so you
21:50 - could stay in web 2 and make a ton of
21:52 - money and have a great career
21:54 - for a long time you know facebook's not
21:56 - going anywhere google's not going
21:58 - anywhere twitter's not going anywhere
21:59 - these companies are going to be around
22:00 - for a long time right yeah
22:02 - nothing wrong with that
22:04 - and also getting stock options in those
22:06 - companies is still going to be great you
22:08 - know
22:09 - but if you want to work on on something
22:12 - that's truly exciting and innovative
22:15 - and
22:16 - allows you to potentially make
22:18 - generational wealth at this stage then
22:21 - you need to be thinking about web3 and
22:23 - here's why
22:24 - okay we are
22:26 - i you know if you go back in time i
22:28 - think we're
22:30 - at about 1997.
22:33 - um
22:34 - so when you go back in time and think
22:36 - okay where was the world at 1997. you
22:38 - had the very beginnings of the internet
22:41 - yeah and the consumer internet right
22:44 - and you started to see
22:46 - the googles being built right and they
22:48 - were very early right
22:51 - and
22:52 - we are there now so what we're seeing is
22:55 - we have web 3 companies that will
22:57 - absolutely be the infrastructure of the
23:00 - future right so when you think about
23:02 - all the l1 blockchains
23:04 - you have
23:05 - uh solana near tezos avalanche and then
23:10 - you have the layer two block chains
23:12 - arbitram
23:13 - um optimism
23:16 - and then if you have all the totaling
23:17 - companies right yeah polygon right you
23:20 - you know these are going to be the
23:23 - infrastructure that the world is built
23:25 - on right
23:26 - be there right because this is like
23:28 - being able to work at google in 1997. um
23:31 - and what's even what's even more
23:33 - exciting
23:35 - is this so
23:37 - back in 1997
23:39 - um
23:40 - only
23:41 - google employees got stock options
23:43 - right
23:44 - um and vcs okay
23:47 - but what's happening now is you can buy
23:50 - the tokens of these companies now right
23:53 - yes so you can go buy avax which is the
23:56 - token for avalanche right now
23:58 - and so
23:59 - and so this is like being able to be a
24:01 - vc back in 1997. 1997
24:03 - and
24:04 - let me tell you how powerful that is
24:07 - this is where true wealth will be built
24:10 - so if you want to be there and you want
24:12 - to take advantage then then do it like
24:14 - if you want to miss it
24:16 - fine you know um but and then the second
24:19 - thing i'll say is all the talent
24:21 - and that that's not fair
24:23 - i would say
24:25 - the cutting edge talent
24:27 - the the the folks that i truly respect
24:29 - that are building great things are
24:30 - leaving web 2 all of them you know like
24:34 - phd scientists you know
24:38 - senior architect developers
24:40 - the best investors in the world um the
24:43 - best founders in the world
24:45 - there's a mass exodus from exodus from
24:47 - web 2 and it's it's because there's just
24:49 - so many exciting things to be built in
24:50 - web 3.
24:52 - and so i think what you can do is take
24:54 - your web 2 dev skills great if you're a
24:56 - full stack developer awesome all you
24:58 - need to do is go learn solidity and then
25:00 - go apply to work at you know consensus
25:03 - or
25:04 - avax or
25:06 - polygon or any one of these companies
25:09 - people are begging for talent
25:11 - yeah they're begging for talent
25:13 - right and the salaries are matching and
25:15 - you'll get
25:16 - a ton of tokens a ton of options like
25:19 - it's just what's up what's the average
25:21 - salary of uh let's say junior developer
25:24 - in the blockchain world
25:25 - well the cool thing is everybody's a
25:27 - junior developer in the block in the
25:28 - blockchain yeah so nice
25:30 - there's nobody that has five years of
25:32 - experience right i mean so
25:34 - i would say a an experienced solidity
25:36 - developer is someone that's been doing
25:38 - it for like a year right
25:40 - wow so i think if you are if you're kind
25:42 - of a junior dev now in web 2 so say
25:45 - you're learning full stack um javascript
25:48 - and you're like well wait a minute you
25:49 - know i want to go skate where the puck
25:51 - is is going to yeah i'm going to learn
25:53 - some solidity on top of that um you know
25:56 - i
25:57 - and and and you ship a real um and then
25:59 - what i would say to somebody is then
26:01 - write a smart contract that actually
26:03 - does something put a few out in the
26:04 - world and then apply for these jobs and
26:06 - i just can't see you making any less
26:08 - than like 120 grand like as a junior
26:11 - depth damn and it's just because there's
26:13 - nobody there's nobody that knows this
26:15 - stuff now
26:16 - um you know that will start to change
26:18 - but then if you keep cranking i mean you
26:20 - know we're talking like 300 grand for
26:22 - experience solidity devs
26:24 - um
26:25 - you know plus a bunch of stock options
26:27 - plus a ton of tokens
26:29 - yeah
26:30 - there's just
26:32 - you know
26:34 - i just think that
26:35 - this moment doesn't happen very often
26:37 - right i agree i've seen three of them in
26:40 - my life and this is one of those three
26:42 - wow
26:43 - dude that is huge and another thing so i
26:46 - think a couple of things another thing
26:48 - is like people can even get a lot of
26:49 - developers even getting equity in these
26:51 - projects right yeah you get to come out
26:54 - you get tokens i mean well you get you
26:56 - get stock options but even better you
26:57 - get tokens so the the thing that's hard
26:59 - about web 2 and stock options is this
27:03 - is that you can get a bunch of stock
27:05 - options but if the company doesn't quite
27:07 - work out
27:08 - then your stock options can be
27:09 - underwater and that means they're
27:11 - worthless um
27:13 - and what's amazing about web3 is if if
27:17 - you come in and say you work for polygon
27:20 - and you get mad and you get matic tokens
27:23 - on yeah as part of your salary package
27:25 - which you should right yeah so you'd say
27:27 - okay i want 120 base
27:30 - um
27:31 - you know and i want you know x dollars
27:34 - worth of matic tokens
27:36 - yeah which would invest i mean you know
27:38 - you can't just have them and sell them
27:39 - right away but and then yes stock
27:41 - options too so you get this like triple
27:43 - package but the beauty is those matic
27:45 - tokens
27:47 - um they're traded on the open market
27:49 - right so the problem with getting stock
27:51 - options in a private company is you
27:53 - can't trade those they're not liquid
27:56 - yeah yeah that's true and you know not i
27:58 - think polygon is not going to go away
28:00 - but say it didn't work out
28:01 - if you just had polygon stock options
28:04 - and they never went public or the value
28:06 - was less than what you got it for it
28:08 - would be worth nothing
28:10 - if you get mad tokens it's literally
28:12 - like getting
28:13 - uh money right so as soon as they vest
28:16 - just go on to uniswap and swap them for
28:18 - usd
28:19 - right it's real money that's one of the
28:21 - things you're saying is a problem one of
28:23 - my friends one of my good friends in la
28:25 - was discussing with me he's like he
28:27 - worked for blue origin jeff bezos
28:29 - company
28:30 - and uh he's like i got a bunch of
28:32 - options or whatever but he's like
28:35 - they're liquid but they're illiquid and
28:37 - he goes i don't know if jeff is going to
28:39 - take this company public or not and if
28:40 - he doesn't take it public then in x
28:42 - amount of years i won't be able to
28:44 - invest
28:45 - you get nothing right whereas that's
28:47 - huge if you work for any web3 company
28:50 - yeah they'll usually have a token now
28:52 - some don't so like yeah really a bunch
28:54 - of good quality projects like arbitrary
28:56 - and optimism they don't have tokens yet
28:58 - yeah um you know open c doesn't have a
29:01 - token
29:02 - yeah you know there's a couple projects
29:04 - that don't have tokens so
29:07 - a lot of companies in web 3 have tokens
29:09 - they do yeah because that that was
29:11 - something that was super interesting to
29:12 - me because
29:14 - you know um for example i don't know if
29:16 - you know the company called replit or
29:17 - repple.com yep online id in 2016 or 2017
29:22 - i was sending a bunch of traffic there
29:23 - and he hit me up and he was like hey
29:24 - what the heck are you doing
29:26 - and at that point they weren't funded
29:28 - they weren't this big company or
29:29 - whatever right
29:31 - uh if i if they had a token i would have
29:33 - invested in them back then yeah you know
29:36 - and that would have been huge and i
29:38 - would have told a lot of my audience to
29:40 - invest in them and that would have been
29:42 - massive but for four years later now
29:44 - they're going to venture capital right
29:46 - raising hundreds of millions and a bunch
29:49 - of bunch of those people are getting to
29:51 - invest in them and getting this
29:52 - opportunity you're not but but yeah
29:54 - exactly and i'm like dude that would
29:56 - have been so amazing if that a token i
29:58 - know see see web3 rewards
30:01 - truly loyal uh fans and followers right
30:04 - so this is the beauty is
30:06 - is the incentives are all aligned so for
30:08 - instance say that you uh take a job at
30:11 - avalanche
30:12 - and
30:13 - you get your standard you know package
30:15 - plus you get some stock options great
30:17 - but say you also get avax tokens right
30:20 - now are you going to be aligned and
30:23 - hoping those avax tokens value goes up
30:26 - yes
30:27 - you're going to really you're going to
30:29 - truly care about avalanche
30:32 - and its value going up because you are
30:34 - an owner right yes and in web 2
30:37 - i think you're you're sort of a pretend
30:39 - owner like oh you can have these stock
30:40 - options
30:41 - they're not really liquid and they're
30:43 - only worth something if if eventually
30:46 - you know the investors and the founders
30:48 - agree that the company's worth x
30:51 - whereas
30:52 - if you own avax tokens or matic tokens
30:55 - on polygon or or you know
30:59 - uni tokens on uniswap like you're an
31:01 - owner you actually own
31:02 - part of the company you own part of the
31:04 - market cap and you can sell those
31:06 - yeah
31:07 - and so you turn people into advocates
31:09 - right so everybody all sudden
31:11 - it's so crazy like so why why are people
31:15 - let's take
31:16 - dead fellas a as an nft project that i
31:18 - love right so yeah
31:20 - so dead fellas they're these kind of
31:22 - cute zombie-like you know
31:24 - characters
31:25 - i think the floor is maybe three eth
31:28 - right now uh which is about twelve
31:30 - thousand you know or nine thousand bucks
31:32 - okay yeah um
31:34 - why would i pay nine thousand dollars
31:35 - for a jpeg and then
31:37 - tell tell everybody how excited i am
31:40 - about it it's because i'm an owner like
31:42 - yeah and and and my incentives are
31:45 - aligned that i want to see dead fellas
31:48 - increase in value because i'm an owner
31:49 - and you know i don't plan on selling
31:51 - those but at some point if i did
31:53 - i win if the value goes up now some
31:56 - people go well that's that's a call to
31:57 - ponzi right right right right that's a
32:00 - big one that a lot of people said like
32:01 - oh it's a ponzi scheme well but but i
32:04 - think that's an oversimplification of of
32:07 - economics right
32:09 - every
32:10 - everything's a ponzi right so if if i
32:13 - buy a
32:15 - uh you know a ford fiat
32:17 - yeah you know i
32:19 - want ford fiats to be valuable like i
32:22 - don't want yeah that's true you want to
32:24 - sell it for more yeah i don't want it to
32:25 - be worth less so like if someone sells
32:27 - you like do you love your car i'm like
32:28 - yeah it's pretty great i mean you you're
32:31 - always trying to get people excited
32:33 - about things you own because you're you
32:34 - have a vested interest now yeah um
32:37 - that's it's no different in web3 but you
32:40 - actually get to own it
32:41 - right yeah you know if you go to
32:43 - fortnight and say well you know i bought
32:44 - a skin
32:45 - and you and you want to flex the truth
32:47 - is you don't anything and
32:50 - and
32:51 - uh
32:52 - you can't sell it you're a digital slave
32:55 - on their platform do you think in future
32:57 - even purchasing cars
32:59 - and homes will be on the blockchain 100
33:01 - yeah
33:02 - we'll look back at we'll look back and
33:04 - think it's just hilariously primitive
33:06 - that we had like pieces of paper like
33:09 - you have a deed and you can like lose it
33:12 - what's this
33:13 - it'll be all on the blockchain what's
33:15 - funny is that i i jokingly always say
33:18 - like
33:19 - web 3 is kind of like going in the past
33:21 - because we went from crud to just cru
33:24 - like update and delete is just gone yeah
33:27 - like there you go that's what it's gone
33:29 - yeah exactly it's immutable data types
33:32 - yeah forever i mean right it's just so
33:34 - exciting and i you know there there is a
33:37 - there is this kind of backlash by part
33:40 - of the web 2 community against web3 and
33:41 - i just don't understand it
33:43 - it it's like getting angry at
33:45 - electricity when it came out you know oh
33:47 - yeah yeah yeah i just you know
33:50 - the future is here yeah and you can
33:52 - either
33:53 - embrace it and i think i think part of
33:56 - it or you can fight it
33:58 - yeah i think it's frustrating when it's
34:00 - hard to grasp your mind around it i
34:02 - won't lie sometimes it frustrates me to
34:04 - go
34:05 - i have to spend two thousand dollars to
34:07 - deploy a function and then one of my
34:09 - friends was like oh yeah because it had
34:11 - like a raise and you have to loop
34:13 - through it i'm like what [ __ ]
34:14 - function doesn't have a raise
34:16 - [Laughter]
34:18 - it feels like a backwards step right so
34:20 - those things or sometimes for the
34:23 - transaction to go through or like my
34:25 - money to move sometimes on the ethereum
34:26 - blockchain it's like it's very expensive
34:29 - yeah it's backed up there are a lot of
34:30 - people online and now it takes 40
34:32 - minutes and i'm like
34:33 - geez that is so long but i think a lot
34:35 - of this is being developed and they're
34:38 - you know
34:38 - prices are going to keep going down as
34:40 - the technology keeps getting developed
34:42 - so i think sort of improves
34:44 - so people need to understand this okay
34:47 - the reason why it's expensive to
34:49 - transact on ethereum is because it is
34:51 - secure and it is decentralized right
34:54 - so so
34:56 - let's back this up for a minute right so
34:58 - uh
34:59 - the the ethereum network is secured by
35:04 - thousands of nodes right this is
35:05 - literally people running
35:08 - little servers like i have one in my
35:09 - house that's running the the complete
35:12 - ethereum
35:13 - uh blockchain on that node
35:16 - now what happens is
35:18 - um
35:19 - when i i think ethereum does around
35:21 - seven transactions a second
35:24 - now that's not enough right so the whole
35:26 - world is competing to get included in
35:29 - those in those blocks which means it
35:31 - gets more expensive okay so now what
35:34 - what do we do
35:35 - now you either make it
35:37 - you have to sacrifice one of these
35:39 - things you know either
35:40 - decentralization
35:42 - speed um or security right so
35:46 - what is going to happen
35:47 - we're just in this temporary phrase
35:49 - where gas is very high on on ethereum
35:51 - main net so layer one we're gonna be
35:53 - moving to layer two right so in the
35:55 - future you're gonna be deploying your
35:57 - contracts on arbitrom or optimism
36:00 - uh you're never going to touch ethereum
36:02 - or what about polygon or a polygon right
36:05 - so um got it now we're just in this
36:07 - weird phase where humans are interacting
36:09 - with ethereum and that's not going to
36:11 - happen in the future
36:12 - um and people sort of yeah and and
36:16 - you know news flash gas prices are not
36:18 - going to go down in ethereum um but i
36:20 - mean if you use polygon don't they
36:22 - market it like it's ethereum but no they
36:24 - have gas fees no they do so this is
36:25 - layer one versus layer two so right
36:28 - so layer one is the base block chain
36:31 - it's think about it as as
36:33 - the metal right if you're dealing with
36:35 - the metal of the server
36:37 - it's uh where all of the programs and
36:40 - the robots live
36:42 - yeah and then what happens is uh all of
36:45 - these transactions get rolled up to
36:47 - layer uh sorry layer two gets rolled
36:49 - down to layer one yeah and that's why
36:51 - and it will be cheap on layer two um but
36:54 - just have to give it some time and but
36:56 - also remember
36:57 - if it's truly cheap and truly fast then
37:00 - you increase spam right
37:02 - so there has to be some cost to
37:05 - transacting on the network
37:06 - got it and what are your thoughts on
37:08 - something like solana which is faster
37:11 - and it happens fast but i'm sure there's
37:13 - some kind of difference it's not
37:14 - decentralized yeah so that's got it you
37:17 - know i'm betting on all of these right
37:19 - so i own a bunch of uh saul tokens
37:22 - because i think solana i think every i
37:24 - think it's gonna be a multi-blockchain
37:26 - world and i think many of these
37:28 - blockchains are gonna win now i think
37:30 - i think ethereum is gonna be the primary
37:32 - blockchain which is why i'm betting the
37:34 - most
37:35 - uh and i hold you know the largest thing
37:37 - i hold is ether
37:40 - but
37:40 - a lot of these you know all l1 like um
37:45 - avalanche near phantom
37:47 - and these
37:49 - side chains and l2s like polygons um you
37:52 - know arb trims and optims i think
37:54 - they're all going to win
37:55 - yeah
37:56 - and uh it's
37:58 - it's a little bit like going back to 97
38:00 - and and sort of
38:02 - you know complaining like well you know
38:04 - ftp is so hard and so slow well it's
38:07 - like because it's we're early
38:09 - yeah yeah yeah yeah of course it's hard
38:10 - and slow like yeah now it's like we've
38:13 - evolved from ftp and nobody uses anymore
38:15 - but at some point we didn't need to use
38:17 - it right i mean if if you if someone
38:20 - told you ec2
38:21 - you know if you went back in time and
38:23 - you and you told someone from the past
38:24 - like you're going to be able to spin up
38:26 - you know a virtual machine in the cloud
38:29 - instantly for pennies on the dollar
38:31 - you'd say wow
38:33 - and then they told you actually forget
38:34 - about it there's gonna be functions that
38:35 - live in the cloud like you're not even
38:37 - gonna have the server infrastructure be
38:39 - like i don't even understand that
38:40 - absolutely yeah exactly we're we're in
38:43 - ftp land here people like just be
38:45 - patient
38:46 - and and look where the puck is is
38:48 - sliding absolutely so let's transition a
38:52 - little bit into
38:54 - what you know you moved into proof
38:56 - what made you move into proof collective
38:59 - what is this project all about
39:01 - and uh you know kind of what your role
39:04 - is there so let's talk about that a
39:05 - little bit yeah i'm sure
39:07 - um so
39:08 - like you said i retired in december
39:11 - um
39:12 - and uh kevin was like
39:14 - hey you know you've been listening to
39:16 - podcasts
39:17 - i'm going to launch an nft
39:19 - and it's going to be a gated community
39:23 - so if you hold the nft you can be a part
39:25 - of the community and there's going to be
39:27 - a thousand members
39:28 - and it's called proof collective
39:30 - and it's for serious nft collectors
39:33 - and we're gonna have a lot of fun you
39:35 - know so i'm gonna launch it and and i
39:37 - was like i'm in i mean that sounds
39:39 - super fun you know so put me on the list
39:42 - and he said cool you know i'll hold a
39:44 - hold a pass back for you um yeah
39:47 - and so
39:48 - um i i bought one pass
39:51 - um and this was like december 12th
39:54 - wow and
39:55 - everything kevin touches turns to gold i
39:57 - mean he he is just extremely good
40:00 - founder
40:01 - um he's a wonderful human
40:03 - um he has a really really good sixth
40:06 - sense for for product
40:08 - so i just knew yeah i'm in like whatever
40:10 - kevin's doing i'm in
40:12 - um so i joined this collective which
40:15 - which so you buy the nft on openc
40:17 - yeah actually it was on it was on
40:19 - proof.xyz and you could only get one
40:23 - nft for this
40:25 - it depends so there is what's called a
40:27 - dutch auction
40:28 - yeah where
40:29 - the price is set high and then every 15
40:32 - minutes or x amount of minutes it
40:34 - actually goes down in value
40:36 - and it's a way to figure out what the
40:38 - price is the people could have bought
40:39 - multiple two right as it was going down
40:41 - yeah they could have bought so it
40:42 - started off at five eighth um which at
40:44 - the time eath was about
40:46 - four grand so it started off at 20k
40:49 - per pass
40:50 - and you could you could have bought 10
40:52 - if you wanted it 20k or 500 or 40 5e
40:57 - but you know most people are like oh
40:58 - it's really expensive um
41:00 - so some people bought it five
41:02 - and then and then it kind of started
41:04 - ticking down it didn't all sell out at
41:07 - five eve why don't you go the other why
41:08 - did you guys go the other way like well
41:10 - because they would sell it it would sell
41:11 - at instantly low right oh yeah yeah yeah
41:14 - that's a good point you start at high
41:16 - see okay how many people are going to
41:17 - pay five it ticks down to 4.75 how many
41:19 - people are going to buy there and it's a
41:21 - great price discovery mechanism so it
41:23 - started ticking down and he you know
41:25 - thankfully held him back for me said hey
41:26 - i'll just um hold one back for you
41:28 - whatever the floor ends up being
41:31 - yeah so we saw them all you know some
41:33 - sold it at five a chunk of them sold out
41:36 - at three and then and then they all went
41:38 - i think at about 1.5
41:41 - wow and and so
41:43 - um you know got in the discord which is
41:45 - a member's only discord and it was just
41:47 - really fun
41:48 - you know
41:50 - i had a wonderful time just meeting
41:51 - everybody and
41:52 - everyone's like fascinating like there

42:01 - was just like a really interesting
42:04 - you know group of people yeah that is
42:06 - so i was just in the discord and i'm

47:19 - um
47:20 - cool so let's start off with the first
47:22 - one ryan are you rich
47:25 - um that's relative
47:27 - all right let's go on to the second
47:29 - question what is the biggest regret you
47:32 - have
47:33 - oh that's a hard one um
47:40 - oh boy it you know i have a lot of
47:42 - regrets um i think you know i think
47:44 - everybody has regrets but they don't
47:45 - talk about it um
47:47 - i would say
47:50 - uh i mean
47:52 - a funny one is like i wish i wouldn't
47:54 - have lost my my bitcoin on mount gox so
47:57 - um but a more serious one is you know i
48:00 - i learned a lot being a ceo founder um
48:03 - and especially a treehouse and i think i
48:06 - would have i wish i would have
48:09 - empowered people
48:11 - more
48:12 - um and trusted them to do their job
48:15 - um i think i think i micromanaged a lot
48:18 - um and i think looking back i would
48:20 - empower and set people free more
48:23 - yeah it was a good lesson to learn
48:26 - that's deep uh that's really helpful for
48:29 - me as well actually so i'll write that
48:30 - down
48:32 - um
48:33 - okay what is the biggest loss you've
48:35 - experienced in let's say a business or
48:37 - something along those lines
48:40 - um
48:41 - boy
48:43 - i mean uh you know
48:46 - i've missed
48:47 - deals
48:49 - that are worth 100 million dollars so
48:51 - you know
48:52 - uh
48:53 - you see some big alerts come by
48:55 - some big ones come by sometimes and you
48:57 - miss them you know
48:59 - but you can't i mean you know
49:00 - hindsight's 20 20. so is it
49:03 - to just give a general gist of that type
49:05 - of deal is that like acquisition type of
49:07 - deal or is this something else we're
49:08 - talking completely different acquisition
49:10 - type stuff yeah
49:12 - you know i mean being a founder is just
49:14 - so
49:15 - hard because
49:17 - they're no one knows the right answer um
49:20 - yeah and when you are at the top you had
49:22 - something on the table and you said no
49:26 - yeah so you know that stuff happens and
49:29 - it's because you you know you think at
49:30 - the right time at that moment it's the
49:32 - right thing to do and you know
49:34 - um and it it could have been absolutely
49:36 - the right call right um so you never you
49:39 - never really know
49:40 - and one thing i'm learning how to do is
49:42 - is look back on those kind of decisions
49:44 - and say well i don't know what would
49:46 - have happened if i would have said yes i
49:47 - i can't be assured that that was
49:50 - actually a better outcome
49:52 - yeah
49:53 - you know it could have been worse
49:54 - somehow um absolutely just have to uh
49:58 - you know just trying to move on

Cleaned transcript:

what is the biggest loss you've experienced in let's say a business or something along those lines i mean uh you know i've missed deals that are worth 100 million dollars some big ones come by sometimes and you miss them you know but you can't i mean you know hindsight's 20 20. um yeah it's a good lesson to learn what it is facing emerge that i can't pick it up what's up guys how's it going this is quasi from clever programmer today we have ryan carson on our podcast and some of you might actually know him a lot of you will know him when i tell you one of the companies that he's actually founded but he is the founder of personified drops and and team treehouse over the last 22 years he's the ceo and founder of three companies and one nonprofit and he's helped over 600 000 people learn how to co code okay so that is pretty epic for a lot of you who know team treehouse drop it in the comments below i'm very excited and grateful that he took his time to be on this podcast and i got a lot of questions for him because he's now jumping into the web 3 space and i want to know what he knows and hopefully bring you guys that value so with that said i'm gonna shut my mouth ryan welcome on board qazi it is good to be here i've respected you for a long time what you built it's a lot of fun to talk shop so let's get to it awesome man so thanks for jumping on here i mean a lot has happened since we even last spoke you know which was a a week ago and then before that a few years ago uh we spoke you know talk to me kind of where you're at right now because i know that i think you you've sold you've exited team treehouse and so kind of talk to me what led to led to you doing that you bet um so i started uh treehouse more than a decade ago and uh you know the reason why is because i got a computer science degree and then i got a job and then i realized uh you didn't need the computer science degree um and a lot of people were being held out you know outside of the industry for no good reason and so the thought was hey let's let's launch an affordable accessible school and um and i loved being able to do that you know building treehouse um and empowering over 600 000 people to get better jobs to build wealth for their families is the most meaningful work i've ever done um and i'm so grateful i was able to be a part of that yeah you know through that journey it was my third company uh learned a lot you know um about how to be a ceo um how to run a large organization you know made some mistakes learned a lot through the way and in the end i it felt like it was time for a new owner of treehouse to come in and take it to the next level and found a wonderful choir that came in and and is going to take treehouse to that next level and then i was able to step back and and just kind of breathe for a minute um so so the interesting thing was um my very first investor is a guy named kevin rose and he started a site called dig a long time ago and really became a wellknown investor founder and he was my first investor and so he and i have known each other for almost 15 years now um and and so when this was you know when when my treehouse journey was kind of winding down um uh he and i were messaging each other and he said hey i've started this podcast uh called modern finance yeah it's all it's all about blockchain and and it's about crypto and and he said you should give it a listen um and you know i had paid attention a little bit to blockchain i um back i think it must have been gosh i don't remember when but when mount gox was out i bought some bitcoin you know it was hard and confusing and kind of forgot about it and then yeah box got hacked and i lost all my bitcoin and i just kind of gave up you know i just thought damn how many bitcoin i don't i don't know and i don't want to find out because it's just gonna make me sad um but you know so i like everyone i just thought i don't really get it you know i lost my money i'm just yeah i'm just gonna move on um so i hadn't really thought much about crypto blockchain anything um until kevin sort of said hey you should pay attention and so as my treehouse journey was winding down i began to listen to his podcast and i just you know listened every single episode and i i think as i was listening to it it's just like the light bulb went off and i just knew oh like this is bigger can you can you get everything can you give me some insight into what were some of the things that maybe kevin rose said on his podcast that made you go that clicked because for a lot of people the click is missing you know they're not they're like i can see you can send money uh and i can see you can get rug pulled but like what's the what's the right because a lot of developers think okay is it just hype or is this reality what's happening so what were some of the things that you would say for you clicked or kind of went aha like you had that aha moment so the first thing was was the very first podcast um the guest his name was dc investor and he talked about nfts and i didn't understand what an nft was so so as i was listening to that episode i was driving in my car he explained you know how can a digital item have a unique owner you know how does that work you know because it's so antiintuitive right right i think well can i just right click save like i don't understand how someone can own a digital asset and so as he explained it and how nfts work and how you can prove you know the provenance and the owner of a digital asset i think that's when i went oh my god this will change everything because as soon as i realized oh you know digital assets can be unique and and the ownership can be proven you know all the alarm bells started going off i started thinking about wait a minute you know that means every industry is going to change so it wasn't even about jpegs it was this idea of you know well why isn't your the deed to your house in nft you know that should be the case this should live on the blockchain yeah you know and as soon as that started happening i realized oh my god this is going to change everything and then then it was a process of like learning you know and at first i didn't understand at all so i just started learning and watching youtube videos and i think that's when it became clear that a decentralized global computer that can uh never be changed it you know once the state is set will will change the world because wow you then can separate everything else from these walled vertical gardens that we lived in and then i was just like all in you know it's almost like it became my religion wow that's powerful you know i guess like some of the questions that i remember i used to have so i'll ask them because i know a lot of people on our platform are beginner software developers or maybe have some years of experience but still might be considering it is like when you're looking into and you're like okay i can own an asset so i remember playing you know let's say i played this game called borderlands a long time ago right yeah and now and back in those days they had come up with this new concept of dlcs downloadable content yeah and games just blew up because you just buy all these you know i was buying like when i was playing fifa i was buying messi and all these big players and all these cards and so they were like what you would call an nft card but like i was getting access to messi and i'm like i'm able to prove that i own that and not other people own it because well i bought it it's in my account and when ryan logs into his account he doesn't have it in my mind yeah so doesn't that already mean i have digital ownership you know just like i'll buy a movie i own it you go into your amazon account you don't have it but i have it so i feel like i already have digital ownership what is this digital ownership well the can you sell that messy no so this is the problem right so you don't own anything um this is the great web 2 trick right so we have all these walled gardens right so um you know or gaming platforms you know for instance um you think that you bought that dlc and you own it and it's a flex like you know when you're in the game people can see you have you know a jersey or a player wow you know kazi's got this expensive player respect and then and then and then you actually realize you don't own anything because as soon as you want to take that value out of the game you can't um and so this is the key right so nfts are composable so what that means is if you own a digital asset you own it everywhere right so it's not locked into a vertical garden so for instance if you're on facebook right now yeah um and uh you have a certain number of followers for instance yeah you can't take those followers anywhere else right you don't you don't own them um and so what what everybody is realizing is that if i can digitally own an asset then i actually digitally own it like yeah and that means i can take that asset i can sell it to anybody so a good example makes sense is so there's these games that are coming out now um you know a good example is uh axi infinity have you heard of that yeah yeah i've heard of it it's like the biggest one right they're doing like 200 billion dollars a week like something ridiculous like that i remember when i saw it i was like whoa their market cap was huge too yeah so so for those of you that are listening that are trying to understand this you know a game like axi launched and what happens is you go on to the game and you have to buy your axi which is an animal and think of it as pokemon so you have these animals and they battle each other they're called axes but in order to play you have to buy an axi um now what if you can't afford the axi um uh well let me let me back up so you buy an axi yeah um and they can be expensive you know i i don't actually know right now how much an axi trades for but say it's 500 bucks it's a lot of money um and so say you came on and you bought an axi you then battle it with other axes and if it wins then you unlock uh slp or smooth love potion and smooth love potion if you make enough of it it allows you to mint or create another axi so also you're able to create something that is worth 500 by winning so it's like oh wait a minute so by playing this game i can actually create an asset that is inherently valuable so i started off with one axis 500 bucks i battled a bunch i won and i was able to create another one and all sudden i made back my initial 500 well now i've got two axes why don't i keep battling right and then you unlock more slp and then you then you mint another axi and also you've made 500 net so yeah and now the the crazy thing so this is the exciting thing yeah well that's great that i have 500 but can i actually have the 500 please yes what you do is you take your slp you go to uni swap and you swap it for us dollars so yeah this is the connection like you actually own that asset and you can extract the us dollars or canadian dollars or british pounds or whatever so you're web 2 was a big trick like basically and i was you know all of us got tricked like we ended up working very hard on other people's platforms to build value for them i see you know so you're working really hard on youtube and and you know youtube uh you're getting you know ad revenue off that you're getting followers off that and subscribers but the truth is you don't own anything um yeah you know you're a digital surf on their on their kingdom and so this is the big switch is is like actually owning the content now yes there's a ton of scammers and yes there's a bunch a bunch of rug pulls and but this happened when ecommerce launched in web one right everybody was scared about putting your credit card in a website ah yeah yeah yeah that's true yeah this is like 2001 right so yeah you know of course people are afraid and of course there were scammers but that doesn't mean the platform was bad or that it was inherently evil all it was was technology was advancing so i think that's what's happening with web3 got it wow uh this is really cool like even it reminds me of i i started doing this options trading one time and um i went into this platform and then i won some money and then i tried to take it out and they just like locked it and i couldn't take it out and i was like [ __ ] and i was freaking out because you didn't own it right and this happened with me even one time with a long time ago i don't know if it was coinbase or no it was like some other service i was using and i was trying to sell my bitcoin because they were going down that day and i couldn't they locked it yeah and so that was super frustrating but it feels like with this that that's not really likely to happen because i own it right so i can you own it and nobody nobody can stop you from sending it or or trading it or or using it so so so take this for instance so uh one of the big now look when we say web3 what we're talking about is a couple of different things right we're talking about blockchains so what is web3 i guess just so everybody can understand so we're saying web 2 web 3 web one what is web3 ryan so web3 is a group of technology technological innovations put together so it's number one blockchains right so we have these global um immutable databases called blockchains right so so bitcoin was was the first right yeah um and and and then on ethereum launched after that right um these are both proof of work which means that you have these computers that compete for the right to be able to save these block chains and then they get rewarded for that it's expensive and and bad for the environment so so now the blockchains are moving to what's called proof of stake which is not energy intensive it's very green and so you have blockchain so that's number one and so bitcoin was was the first and you can't build applications on top of bitcoin right there's no smart contracts there is there's something now called stacks which you can but it's new so so bitcoin is really just a ledger that you can write transactions to and data to great it also has a token called bitcoin so it's a little confusing that the network is called bitcoin and the token's called bitcoin got it then the then the the next layer one launch which is ethereum yeah it has the ability to write smart contracts so you can now program on top of this network right so yeah you're going to hear terms like solidity which is a programming language that you write smart contracts and and smart contracts is just another word for programs um yeah yeah yeah so a lot of your viewers have maybe tried learning solidity if if you all haven't do it um yeah there's so much demand for facility developers it's it's just crazy so that's blockchains now the next thing you have on top of that is something called defy or decentralized finance so once you have blockchains and people have the right to interact directly with each other without anybody's permission right so for instance as soon as i have ether in my metamask wallet and you have ether in your metamask wallet we can transact with each other and we don't have to get permission from any government any bank or anybody yeah that's called permissionless or trustless we don't have to trust each other right because code is what combines us right so as soon as you can transact then you can do decentralized finance now the reason why this is so exciting is because we used to have to go you know to the nasdaq or to our bank or or to paypal and say can i please send this person and they'd say well i don't know tell me where you live first you know tell me who you are um you know uh let's i don't know if you can send that much money today you know and there's all these controls around you and some of them are good um but as soon as you have decentralized permissionless trustless uh transaction then you can do d5 so a good example of defy is if i have you know one ether yeah and you have three thousand dollars yeah and we want to trade that yeah you know how do we do it without a bank or without coinbase so what you do is you go to sushi swap or uniswap and there's this amazing bit of code called an automatic automated market maker which will allow us to trade tokens with each other that trustlessly and it's amazing it's just code you know yeah and it doesn't you don't have to worry like do i have the ether and do you have the us dollars you know because either you do you don't and if if you do then you can trade um wow yeah so d5 is a big part of web3 yeah yeah and then you have nfts so nfts it's they're a standard it's called erc 721 or erc 1155 and what that is is you know digital ownership of assets and people are fixated right now on you know punks or apes or or or jpegs but this is not where this is not the true power of nfts yeah right the true power is any asset in the world is going to be on the blockchain right so anything you can own will eventually be on the blockchain so you combine these things together um and the whole world's going to change um i mean i've i've been around to see web one web two and uh i'm i'm all in like i know that this is where the future is going and it's we're super early right but it's very very exciting which is why everybody says good morning right yeah because we're really yeah it took me a second to learn that on twitter why is this happening what is everybody saying right so look right you're retired right you but what that basically means is you have money to lift for the rest of your life why work and why do why are you doing something with web3 right now it's just so exciting it's so exciting i mean the the the most important thing um so you know maslow's hierarchy right so at the base level you need to be able to survive right you need to be able to have shelter i need to be able to eat yeah and then as soon as that base layer of maslow's hierarchy is filled then you can move up and say okay now i can feed myself and i have shelter okay now i want to start earning enough money that i can save money right so i can plan for the future once you can do that and you move up the next level yeah and then once you can save enough then the next goal is to become independently wealthy okay have enough money that that my money works for me and pays me right yeah um but that's that's not what makes people ultimately happy what makes people happy is having purpose yeah um and and doing something um that makes you feel useful yeah and so in the end i i just um saw was happening with web3 um you know my good friend kevin you know had started proof um this exciting project and i just thought i want to be a part of that you know i want to be a part of part of a team um got it and it's just so much fun like i'm actually working too much because i can't stop myself and i was on twitter doing a twitter spaces last night until until like 11 30. i'm like i need to go to bed like what am i doing oh that's sick that's awesome that's awesome i'd love to hop in there next time yeah that is super cool so i guess talk to me about what is happening in this right so you jump into this you're interested you're like i want to do this one thing before we get into kind of what you're doing with proof is if if you're a developer what is why should a web 2 developer move into and do stuff with web 3. okay the the reason why is you need to skate where the puck is going okay so um and you want to be joining companies that are truly innovating right so you could stay in web 2 and make a ton of money and have a great career for a long time you know facebook's not going anywhere google's not going anywhere twitter's not going anywhere these companies are going to be around for a long time right yeah nothing wrong with that and also getting stock options in those companies is still going to be great you know but if you want to work on on something that's truly exciting and innovative and allows you to potentially make generational wealth at this stage then you need to be thinking about web3 and here's why okay we are i you know if you go back in time i think we're at about 1997. um so when you go back in time and think okay where was the world at 1997. you had the very beginnings of the internet yeah and the consumer internet right and you started to see the googles being built right and they were very early right and we are there now so what we're seeing is we have web 3 companies that will absolutely be the infrastructure of the future right so when you think about all the l1 blockchains you have uh solana near tezos avalanche and then you have the layer two block chains arbitram um optimism and then if you have all the totaling companies right yeah polygon right you you know these are going to be the infrastructure that the world is built on right be there right because this is like being able to work at google in 1997. um and what's even what's even more exciting is this so back in 1997 um only google employees got stock options right um and vcs okay but what's happening now is you can buy the tokens of these companies now right yes so you can go buy avax which is the token for avalanche right now and so and so this is like being able to be a vc back in 1997. 1997 and let me tell you how powerful that is this is where true wealth will be built so if you want to be there and you want to take advantage then then do it like if you want to miss it fine you know um but and then the second thing i'll say is all the talent and that that's not fair i would say the cutting edge talent the the the folks that i truly respect that are building great things are leaving web 2 all of them you know like phd scientists you know senior architect developers the best investors in the world um the best founders in the world there's a mass exodus from exodus from web 2 and it's it's because there's just so many exciting things to be built in web 3. and so i think what you can do is take your web 2 dev skills great if you're a full stack developer awesome all you need to do is go learn solidity and then go apply to work at you know consensus or avax or polygon or any one of these companies people are begging for talent yeah they're begging for talent right and the salaries are matching and you'll get a ton of tokens a ton of options like it's just what's up what's the average salary of uh let's say junior developer in the blockchain world well the cool thing is everybody's a junior developer in the block in the blockchain yeah so nice there's nobody that has five years of experience right i mean so i would say a an experienced solidity developer is someone that's been doing it for like a year right wow so i think if you are if you're kind of a junior dev now in web 2 so say you're learning full stack um javascript and you're like well wait a minute you know i want to go skate where the puck is is going to yeah i'm going to learn some solidity on top of that um you know i and and and you ship a real um and then what i would say to somebody is then write a smart contract that actually does something put a few out in the world and then apply for these jobs and i just can't see you making any less than like 120 grand like as a junior depth damn and it's just because there's nobody there's nobody that knows this stuff now um you know that will start to change but then if you keep cranking i mean you know we're talking like 300 grand for experience solidity devs um you know plus a bunch of stock options plus a ton of tokens yeah there's just you know i just think that this moment doesn't happen very often right i agree i've seen three of them in my life and this is one of those three wow dude that is huge and another thing so i think a couple of things another thing is like people can even get a lot of developers even getting equity in these projects right yeah you get to come out you get tokens i mean well you get you get stock options but even better you get tokens so the the thing that's hard about web 2 and stock options is this is that you can get a bunch of stock options but if the company doesn't quite work out then your stock options can be underwater and that means they're worthless um and what's amazing about web3 is if if you come in and say you work for polygon and you get mad and you get matic tokens on yeah as part of your salary package which you should right yeah so you'd say okay i want 120 base um you know and i want you know x dollars worth of matic tokens yeah which would invest i mean you know you can't just have them and sell them right away but and then yes stock options too so you get this like triple package but the beauty is those matic tokens um they're traded on the open market right so the problem with getting stock options in a private company is you can't trade those they're not liquid yeah yeah that's true and you know not i think polygon is not going to go away but say it didn't work out if you just had polygon stock options and they never went public or the value was less than what you got it for it would be worth nothing if you get mad tokens it's literally like getting uh money right so as soon as they vest just go on to uniswap and swap them for usd right it's real money that's one of the things you're saying is a problem one of my friends one of my good friends in la was discussing with me he's like he worked for blue origin jeff bezos company and uh he's like i got a bunch of options or whatever but he's like they're liquid but they're illiquid and he goes i don't know if jeff is going to take this company public or not and if he doesn't take it public then in x amount of years i won't be able to invest you get nothing right whereas that's huge if you work for any web3 company yeah they'll usually have a token now some don't so like yeah really a bunch of good quality projects like arbitrary and optimism they don't have tokens yet yeah um you know open c doesn't have a token yeah you know there's a couple projects that don't have tokens so a lot of companies in web 3 have tokens they do yeah because that that was something that was super interesting to me because you know um for example i don't know if you know the company called replit or repple.com yep online id in 2016 or 2017 i was sending a bunch of traffic there and he hit me up and he was like hey what the heck are you doing and at that point they weren't funded they weren't this big company or whatever right uh if i if they had a token i would have invested in them back then yeah you know and that would have been huge and i would have told a lot of my audience to invest in them and that would have been massive but for four years later now they're going to venture capital right raising hundreds of millions and a bunch of bunch of those people are getting to invest in them and getting this opportunity you're not but but yeah exactly and i'm like dude that would have been so amazing if that a token i know see see web3 rewards truly loyal uh fans and followers right so this is the beauty is is the incentives are all aligned so for instance say that you uh take a job at avalanche and you get your standard you know package plus you get some stock options great but say you also get avax tokens right now are you going to be aligned and hoping those avax tokens value goes up yes you're going to really you're going to truly care about avalanche and its value going up because you are an owner right yes and in web 2 i think you're you're sort of a pretend owner like oh you can have these stock options they're not really liquid and they're only worth something if if eventually you know the investors and the founders agree that the company's worth x whereas if you own avax tokens or matic tokens on polygon or or you know uni tokens on uniswap like you're an owner you actually own part of the company you own part of the market cap and you can sell those yeah and so you turn people into advocates right so everybody all sudden it's so crazy like so why why are people let's take dead fellas a as an nft project that i love right so yeah so dead fellas they're these kind of cute zombielike you know characters i think the floor is maybe three eth right now uh which is about twelve thousand you know or nine thousand bucks okay yeah um why would i pay nine thousand dollars for a jpeg and then tell tell everybody how excited i am about it it's because i'm an owner like yeah and and and my incentives are aligned that i want to see dead fellas increase in value because i'm an owner and you know i don't plan on selling those but at some point if i did i win if the value goes up now some people go well that's that's a call to ponzi right right right right that's a big one that a lot of people said like oh it's a ponzi scheme well but but i think that's an oversimplification of of economics right every everything's a ponzi right so if if i buy a uh you know a ford fiat yeah you know i want ford fiats to be valuable like i don't want yeah that's true you want to sell it for more yeah i don't want it to be worth less so like if someone sells you like do you love your car i'm like yeah it's pretty great i mean you you're always trying to get people excited about things you own because you're you have a vested interest now yeah um that's it's no different in web3 but you actually get to own it right yeah you know if you go to fortnight and say well you know i bought a skin and you and you want to flex the truth is you don't anything and and uh you can't sell it you're a digital slave on their platform do you think in future even purchasing cars and homes will be on the blockchain 100 yeah we'll look back at we'll look back and think it's just hilariously primitive that we had like pieces of paper like you have a deed and you can like lose it what's this it'll be all on the blockchain what's funny is that i i jokingly always say like web 3 is kind of like going in the past because we went from crud to just cru like update and delete is just gone yeah like there you go that's what it's gone yeah exactly it's immutable data types yeah forever i mean right it's just so exciting and i you know there there is a there is this kind of backlash by part of the web 2 community against web3 and i just don't understand it it it's like getting angry at electricity when it came out you know oh yeah yeah yeah i just you know the future is here yeah and you can either embrace it and i think i think part of it or you can fight it yeah i think it's frustrating when it's hard to grasp your mind around it i won't lie sometimes it frustrates me to go i have to spend two thousand dollars to deploy a function and then one of my friends was like oh yeah because it had like a raise and you have to loop through it i'm like what [ __ ] function doesn't have a raise [Laughter] it feels like a backwards step right so those things or sometimes for the transaction to go through or like my money to move sometimes on the ethereum blockchain it's like it's very expensive yeah it's backed up there are a lot of people online and now it takes 40 minutes and i'm like geez that is so long but i think a lot of this is being developed and they're you know prices are going to keep going down as the technology keeps getting developed so i think sort of improves so people need to understand this okay the reason why it's expensive to transact on ethereum is because it is secure and it is decentralized right so so let's back this up for a minute right so uh the the ethereum network is secured by thousands of nodes right this is literally people running little servers like i have one in my house that's running the the complete ethereum uh blockchain on that node now what happens is um when i i think ethereum does around seven transactions a second now that's not enough right so the whole world is competing to get included in those in those blocks which means it gets more expensive okay so now what what do we do now you either make it you have to sacrifice one of these things you know either decentralization speed um or security right so what is going to happen we're just in this temporary phrase where gas is very high on on ethereum main net so layer one we're gonna be moving to layer two right so in the future you're gonna be deploying your contracts on arbitrom or optimism uh you're never going to touch ethereum or what about polygon or a polygon right so um got it now we're just in this weird phase where humans are interacting with ethereum and that's not going to happen in the future um and people sort of yeah and and you know news flash gas prices are not going to go down in ethereum um but i mean if you use polygon don't they market it like it's ethereum but no they have gas fees no they do so this is layer one versus layer two so right so layer one is the base block chain it's think about it as as the metal right if you're dealing with the metal of the server it's uh where all of the programs and the robots live yeah and then what happens is uh all of these transactions get rolled up to layer uh sorry layer two gets rolled down to layer one yeah and that's why and it will be cheap on layer two um but just have to give it some time and but also remember if it's truly cheap and truly fast then you increase spam right so there has to be some cost to transacting on the network got it and what are your thoughts on something like solana which is faster and it happens fast but i'm sure there's some kind of difference it's not decentralized yeah so that's got it you know i'm betting on all of these right so i own a bunch of uh saul tokens because i think solana i think every i think it's gonna be a multiblockchain world and i think many of these blockchains are gonna win now i think i think ethereum is gonna be the primary blockchain which is why i'm betting the most uh and i hold you know the largest thing i hold is ether but a lot of these you know all l1 like um avalanche near phantom and these side chains and l2s like polygons um you know arb trims and optims i think they're all going to win yeah and uh it's it's a little bit like going back to 97 and and sort of you know complaining like well you know ftp is so hard and so slow well it's like because it's we're early yeah yeah yeah yeah of course it's hard and slow like yeah now it's like we've evolved from ftp and nobody uses anymore but at some point we didn't need to use it right i mean if if you if someone told you ec2 you know if you went back in time and you and you told someone from the past like you're going to be able to spin up you know a virtual machine in the cloud instantly for pennies on the dollar you'd say wow and then they told you actually forget about it there's gonna be functions that live in the cloud like you're not even gonna have the server infrastructure be like i don't even understand that absolutely yeah exactly we're we're in ftp land here people like just be patient and and look where the puck is is sliding absolutely so let's transition a little bit into what you know you moved into proof what made you move into proof collective what is this project all about and uh you know kind of what your role is there so let's talk about that a little bit yeah i'm sure um so like you said i retired in december um and uh kevin was like hey you know you've been listening to podcasts i'm going to launch an nft and it's going to be a gated community so if you hold the nft you can be a part of the community and there's going to be a thousand members and it's called proof collective and it's for serious nft collectors and we're gonna have a lot of fun you know so i'm gonna launch it and and i was like i'm in i mean that sounds super fun you know so put me on the list and he said cool you know i'll hold a hold a pass back for you um yeah and so um i i bought one pass um and this was like december 12th wow and everything kevin touches turns to gold i mean he he is just extremely good founder um he's a wonderful human um he has a really really good sixth sense for for product so i just knew yeah i'm in like whatever kevin's doing i'm in um so i joined this collective which which so you buy the nft on openc yeah actually it was on it was on proof.xyz and you could only get one nft for this it depends so there is what's called a dutch auction yeah where the price is set high and then every 15 minutes or x amount of minutes it actually goes down in value and it's a way to figure out what the price is the people could have bought multiple two right as it was going down yeah they could have bought so it started off at five eighth um which at the time eath was about four grand so it started off at 20k per pass and you could you could have bought 10 if you wanted it 20k or 500 or 40 5e but you know most people are like oh it's really expensive um so some people bought it five and then and then it kind of started ticking down it didn't all sell out at five eve why don't you go the other why did you guys go the other way like well because they would sell it it would sell at instantly low right oh yeah yeah yeah that's a good point you start at high see okay how many people are going to pay five it ticks down to 4.75 how many people are going to buy there and it's a great price discovery mechanism so it started ticking down and he you know thankfully held him back for me said hey i'll just um hold one back for you whatever the floor ends up being yeah so we saw them all you know some sold it at five a chunk of them sold out at three and then and then they all went i think at about 1.5 wow and and so um you know got in the discord which is a member's only discord and it was just really fun you know i had a wonderful time just meeting everybody and everyone's like fascinating like there was doctors and there was developers and there was you know founders and there was artists and it was just like a really interesting you know group of people yeah that is so i was just in the discord and i'm kind of discord newbies i don't regret like not knowing about this because that's so that's so dope well you know it's impossible to catch all these things like yeah yeah there's a bunch of projects that i missed out on so yeah so anyway i'm in the discord having fun and um you know my kids are like what you're using discord dad you know this is so weird i'm like yeah i know our dad is cool i know so then um kevin hits me up he's like hey do you want to be a mod i'm like sure i've got you know nothing to do like i'll be a mod that's so um yeah it was funny so i started modding the server and having fun and and then i think it just hit me like wait a minute um this is so much fun like and i i've been a ceo founder for like 20 years yeah like i think i could help kevin with this um so i just texted and i was like hey man like let me be your co and help you run this thing like you need an experienced operator like me who can just crank and uh let's go like we're friends you know um and he texts me back he's like what you know let's talk call me um so we we talked and he's like let's go um so decided to be the ceo the chief operating officer and um yeah it's just a total blast um the crazy thing about uh this stuff is i think the floor of the project now is like 30 holy [ __ ] that's just like spain i don't know like 90 000 or something i mean you know and kevin and i and justin who run the project are are surprised and delighted i mean it's fascinating that people are finding true value and it's and it started at like three eighths almost right what was the average price somebody paid probably around three a sheath yeah two three eighth um so starting at nine thousand now it's almost at ninety thousand that's crazy yeah i mean then why is the question well people truly value community we're releasing this big project called grails grails is is 21 artists dropping an nft at the same time and the the members get to pick one but they don't know who the artists are they mint the the nft um and then and then they find out who the artist is and and kevin has found um i think he has three of the top grossing nft artists of all time in that jesus yeah wow so when is this when is grails happening it's happening on monday the 28th um is when the public reveal is so you know we're just trying to create a lot of value for our members so it's the minting right so on the 28th is the minting is happening this is not from the secondary market no so what's gonna happen is you know there's a thousand proof members each one gets one grails mint and um as soon as they mint them you know obviously they're going to start some are going to hold some are going to sell in secondary so you'll start seeing these grails hit the secondary market yeah and it'll be interesting to see what kind of happens but we have we have a bunch of plans in the future for proof that are just going to be super fun and cool ryan this is great for the people in the proof community how do i get it how does anybody end that is

we're just curious just looking to check it out right because i think that's a big thing um i know i'll be checking my twitter on march 3rd this is cool i want to do some rapid fire questions in the closing minutes let's do it um and feel free to say yes or no to any of these okay um cool so let's start off with the first one ryan are you rich um that's relative all right let's go on to the second question what is the biggest regret you have oh that's a hard one um oh boy it you know i have a lot of regrets um i think you know i think everybody has regrets but they don't talk about it um i would say uh i mean a funny one is like i wish i wouldn't have lost my my bitcoin on mount gox so um but a more serious one is you know i i learned a lot being a ceo founder um and especially a treehouse and i think i would have i wish i would have empowered people more um and trusted them to do their job um i think i think i micromanaged a lot um and i think looking back i would empower and set people free more yeah it was a good lesson to learn that's deep uh that's really helpful for me as well actually so i'll write that down um okay what is the biggest loss you've experienced in let's say a business or something along those lines um boy i mean uh you know i've missed deals that are worth 100 million dollars so you know uh you see some big alerts come by some big ones come by sometimes and you miss them you know but you can't i mean you know hindsight's 20 20. so is it to just give a general gist of that type of deal is that like acquisition type of deal or is this something else we're talking completely different acquisition type stuff yeah you know i mean being a founder is just so hard because they're no one knows the right answer um yeah and when you are at the top you had something on the table and you said no yeah so you know that stuff happens and it's because you you know you think at the right time at that moment it's the right thing to do and you know um and it it could have been absolutely the right call right um so you never you never really know and one thing i'm learning how to do is is look back on those kind of decisions and say well i don't know what would have happened if i would have said yes i i can't be assured that that was actually a better outcome yeah you know it could have been worse somehow um absolutely just have to uh
