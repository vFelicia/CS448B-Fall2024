00:00 - - All right, so, in this video,
00:00 - we are going to talk about
how append works in a list,
00:04 - because the last video
got a little bit long,
00:06 - but for those of you who
want their minds blown,
00:09 - I want to even give you a better solution
00:10 - for the problem with the
whole splitting thing
00:13 - and then storing it as a
product, price and condition.
00:17 - So remember, we had data:
00:19 - XBOX 360, product;
00:20 - 150, price; condition, new.
00:23 - There's even an easier way to do it.
00:24 - I can say product, I can say comma price,
00:28 - and I can say condition,
and check this magic out.
00:32 - And I'm gonna say data.split that by pipe,
00:38 - and boom, we're done.
00:40 - So now product is the first
element from that list, right?
00:44 - If I show you data.split...
00:48 - By pipe...
00:50 - What you get is, first element,
00:52 - second element, third element.
00:54 - So the first element maps
to this product right...
00:57 - This product right there,
00:59 - price ends up mapping itself to 150,
01:02 - condition ends up mapping itself to new.
01:04 - So go check it out,
it's also kind of known
01:07 - as the concept of tuple unpacking.
01:10 - Really, really advanced concept,
01:12 - we're not gonna get to it 'til maybe
01:13 - an intermediate or advanced course,
01:16 - but yeah, just something a little fun
01:19 - to blow your mind, and
look at how efficient
01:21 - Python lets you do things,
right, efficiently.
01:24 - So, really simple way.
01:27 - But hopefully this shows you the power
01:29 - of how you can combine lists
01:31 - with the whole idea of
slicing and all that.
01:33 - Now, one of the common, most
common things I wanna show you
01:36 - is this whole thing called .append, okay?
01:40 - It's a method that you can use on a list.
01:41 - Very common method, and
this is one of the reasons
01:44 - why lists are a lot
more useful than strings
01:46 - or any other thing.
01:48 - Okay.
01:49 - Oh.
01:50 - Let me just be clear.
01:51 - It's not that strings are not useful,
01:53 - or lists are more useful,
01:55 - but the reason why lists are so awesome
01:58 - is because of that, that's
what makes them unique.
02:00 - Okay?
02:01 - So, let me give you some list with...
02:07 - Sure, let's give you racers, or,
02:10 - let's do something simple.
02:11 - Let's do numbers.
02:14 - Okay?
02:15 - Now, there's a really easy
way to grow this list,
02:18 - so I wanna keep adding
some numbers to this list.
02:20 - Well, how do I do that?
02:22 - What if I wanna add some
number to this list?
02:24 - I know how to access
each of these numbers.
02:26 - I know how to slice each of
these numbers and get a range.
02:29 - I know how to step and slice
02:31 - and give ranges at the same time.
02:32 - I know how to reverse the list.
02:34 - Well, what if I wanna add
more things into the list?
02:38 - Or change existing things in the list?
02:40 - Well...
02:42 - To add things in the list, we use .append.
02:45 - Okay?
02:46 - Append...
02:48 - Meaning add something to
the end, hence append.
02:51 - Pre-pend, to add something
to the beginning.
02:53 - So, we wanna add something right over here
02:56 - in front of the five.
02:57 - So lemme do six, and
if I show you numbers,
03:01 - now you have a bigger list.
03:03 - Let's say I wanted to add another thing.
03:05 - I'll just say append(7).
03:07 - Now if I show you numbers, now
the numbers has grown bigger.
03:09 - You got seven.
03:11 - All right, so, we're using this new app
03:13 - that you're creating where
once your friends raced,
03:16 - you put them in list,
03:17 - but let's say more of
your friends get excited,
03:19 - they're like, wow, this app is amazing,
03:21 - we wanna race too so
you can put us in there,
03:23 - but you're like, I already...
03:25 - The list only takes in three people.
03:26 - Well.
03:28 - Append lets you add in more
people, right, so you store
03:31 - that data, you keep it there,
and then you use append
03:33 - to add more of your friends into the list.
03:37 - What's also nicer is you can use a loop
03:39 - to add things into the list, okay?
03:42 - So for example, I can
say, for i in range(100),
03:46 - if I say print i, well...
03:48 - What is that gonna do?
03:49 - It's gonna go all the way
and print up to 100, okay?
03:52 - So I'm gonna stop this right here,
03:54 - but you get the point.
03:56 - It's basically...
03:58 - Range, right, what is range?
04:00 - Just to show you range of 10,
04:03 - that's effectively just a list, 10, okay,
04:07 - and then we kind of go through it
04:10 - and we print out each of those numbers.
04:12 - I'm gonna get more into
loops in the later video,
04:15 - but just, this is just to give you guys
04:17 - a little bit of an idea
of how we use lists.
04:21 - So, for example, every time i...
04:24 - so the first time, i is zero,
then i is one, i is two,
04:26 - then i is three, and we
keep doing that, right?
04:30 - So, what can I say?
04:32 - I can say...
04:35 - 'Cause, effectively, right,
since this is a list,
04:39 - now I can explain to you guys
a little more about loops,
04:42 - since range is really just a list, right?
04:46 - I'm calling list on it
'cause in Python 3.0
04:48 - they hide it from you, and
you'll learn why later,
04:52 - but, if I call list on it,
04:53 - it shows me what range(10) looks like,
04:55 - and range(10) happens to just be a list,
04:58 - and a list is what allows you
to make that for loop, okay?
05:02 - That you've been making
all when you were creating
05:04 - your original turtle games.
05:06 - So what happened is that...
05:08 - The first time going
through this list, right,
05:12 - let's say, let's just make
a smaller list here for now.
05:15 - When we're going through the
loop, i is zero the first time.
05:19 - And then we call the print
function right here, right?
05:23 - So i is zero the first time,
and then we print zero.
05:27 - Then i is one, because
it's the second element
05:30 - from the list, and so then we
print one out to the screen,
05:34 - then i is two.
05:36 - And then you get two here,
05:38 - and then we print out
two at the bottom, okay?
05:41 - So that's how loop runs, right?
05:43 - The indented code keeps
running over and over again.
05:47 - So, that's really what
allows you do to a loop.
05:50 - It's actually a secret
list in the background,
05:53 - and so that's why you go
from zero to 100 here, right?
05:57 - Now, if I wanted to take
that list that I had
06:00 - at the top called numbers and keep adding
06:02 - a lot of numbers to it, say, up to 30,
06:06 - instead of keep having to manually do it,
06:08 - well, here's a nice way to do it.
06:09 - I can say for i in range...
06:13 - Let's see, 14, or...
06:16 - Let's say, or...
06:18 - I wanna start my range, okay...
06:22 - So if I just showed you,
06:23 - you can also give a start
and a stop to a range,
06:26 - so let's say I wanna
start my range from eight
06:30 - and go to up to but not
including 20, or 21,
06:34 - so I go from eight to 20, right?
06:36 - So these are the numbers
I wanna add, okay?
06:39 - So let's do for number in range...
06:45 - Eight and 21,
06:47 - and I'm not using i, I'm
using the variable number,
06:49 - just so you guys know that you can...
06:51 - You don't have to use...
06:52 - You know, i is not some
magical built-in things
06:55 - that you have to use.
06:56 - Use a variable that makes more sense.
06:58 - In this case, since I'm
going through looping,
07:00 - and it's really numbers,
and now you guys know
07:02 - that i turns into a number,
07:04 - it just makes more sense
to call it a number.
07:06 - So then you're like, oh yeah,
07:08 - this will just be eight the first time,
07:10 - then it'll be nine, then it'll be 10,
07:11 - then it'll be 11, and
then it'll be 12, right?
07:14 - So let's go back...
07:17 - So, let's replace this with just number,
07:20 - and then let's say numbers.append,
07:24 - and to the numbers list,
I wanna keep appending...
07:29 - Each number.
07:31 - Okay?
07:32 - So the first time I'm gonna append,
07:35 - number's gonna be eight, so
then I'm gonna append eight.
07:38 - And so it's gonna add
eight to my numbers list.
07:41 - Then numbers, number, is going to be nine,
07:46 - and then it's going to append nine here.
07:48 - Then number is going to be 10,
and it's going to append 10.
07:51 - Okay?
07:53 - So let's do it like this,
07:54 - let's replace this bad boy with number,
07:57 - let's run it,
07:58 - let's take a look at our list,
08:00 - and, voilà, you see it goes from one
08:04 - all the way to 20.
08:06 - Okay?
08:08 - And...
08:10 - If these were your friends
and we wanted to see...
08:14 - You know, in the reverse order, like,
08:16 - from losers to winners,
08:18 - instead of winners to losers in a race,
08:21 - I would be able to do simply this trick,
08:25 - which says start by
default, stop by default,
08:29 - and then step by negative one.
08:31 - So, that answers that question, right?
08:36 - Okay.
08:37 - Cool.
08:38 - So a lot of stuff, but
hopefully it's making sense,
08:41 - and hopefully...
08:43 - Lists are making more sense,
08:45 - and append is making more sense, right?
08:47 - Append is one of the most useful things.
08:50 - So I want you to remember append,
08:52 - and we'll come back to it,
08:54 - and we'll probably build
more things with it, okay?
08:56 - I'll have a project for you guys as well
08:59 - where you're gonna get
to practice it more.
09:01 - For now, come up with something cool,
09:04 - whatever silly idea or
fun idea that you have,
09:08 - code it up, something simple,
09:10 - post it in the comments below,
09:12 - in the YouTube one or
my website here, okay?
09:16 - CleverProgrammer.com.
09:18 - Either way, that's fine.
09:19 - All right, guys, I'll see
you in the next video.
