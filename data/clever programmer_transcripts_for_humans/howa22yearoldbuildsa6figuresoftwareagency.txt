00:12 - jacob who are you jacob
00:15 - hey guys jacob here um i'm running my
00:18 - own
00:18 - um software agency together with two
00:21 - other founders
00:22 - it's been crazy last eight almost nine
00:26 - months and
00:26 - i'm not gonna lie i have a lot to share
00:28 - with you i've been also working with nas
00:30 - before in a clever programmer team this
00:32 - is how we know each other
00:33 - i've been a coach uh teaching python
00:36 - also i've been
00:36 - working uh three different companies
00:38 - before so yeah
00:40 - yeah it's been quite experience
00:43 - so he is a very experienced guy so jacob
00:46 - guy just so you know okay okay
00:47 - he's kind of chased himself but jacob
00:49 - right he is currently 22 years old he
00:51 - started coding when did you start coding
00:52 - jacob
00:54 - like four or five years old uh like the
00:56 - first line of code i was yeah so yeah
01:00 - really no no no five years old
01:04 - in high school it was like five years
01:07 - yeah yeah
01:07 - five years ago started coding basically
01:09 - you did not you did you go to college or
01:11 - no
01:13 - yeah yeah yeah i've been first going to
01:14 - college in poland and i dropped out and
01:16 - i was working
01:17 - full-time uh job as a programmer and now
01:20 - currently i'm also student however i'm
01:22 - focusing most
01:23 - on my company so it's just
01:26 - yeah so so he guys he started off kind
01:30 - of basically like i said he did go to
01:31 - college
01:32 - he then he got us a job at a startup
01:34 - company right
01:35 - after that he actually worked with us as
01:37 - well over here with cleverprogrammer
01:39 - he was part of a lot of you know he was
01:41 - teaching students he was a
01:42 - big part of profit with python right
01:45 - after that he decided to kind of start
01:47 - out his own
01:47 - agency at the age of 22 right and he's
01:51 - been killing it kind of since then
01:52 - right he is of course it has not been
01:54 - easy for him
01:56 - at all we all know that right he's like
01:58 - holy it's hard
02:00 - right we'll talk about kind of his
02:01 - struggles today what got him into it
02:04 - and what made him now is six figure
02:06 - software agency owner right
02:08 - he has his own statistic but the name of
02:11 - self
02:12 - made which i think is really cool and
02:14 - now he just kind of
02:15 - he has a few people that work with him
02:17 - he has well you have three
02:18 - you have two other co-founders correct
02:20 - with you at this point exactly
02:23 - exactly then we have a designer and two
02:25 - programmers
02:27 - but me and my other co-founder we also
02:29 - like both full-time coders i would say
02:30 - even more than full-time
02:32 - uh this is how it is when you start your
02:33 - own agency it's not really
02:36 - you quit nine to five to do nine to nine
02:38 - or even more
02:39 - from 99 to nine to ten somebody's like
02:42 - hey have you ever dealt with failure oh
02:44 - i'm sure he's dealt with failure
02:46 - especially as he's going to something
02:48 - like this so guys but biscuit today
02:50 - we'll talk about his
02:51 - his you know his process what got him
02:54 - into it right
02:55 - and how he just kind of became the
02:57 - developer that he is today
02:58 - and of course if you have any questions
03:01 - whatsoever
03:02 - let me know of course let us know in the
03:04 - comments and we'll make sure to
03:06 - ask jacob here with those questions okay
03:09 - so if you have anything that's
03:10 - interesting just for go ahead
03:13 - and you know answer that awesome guys so
03:15 - that's pretty much it so
03:16 - jacob now tell me a little about this
03:17 - okay tell me kind of
03:19 - one is what got you into coding how you
03:21 - got started into coding and so forth
03:23 - okay
03:24 - all right yeah so it's early beginnings
03:26 - right i mean my whole life i've been
03:28 - into
03:28 - computers uh right and i started as a
03:31 - really professional gamer at some point
03:32 - i was
03:33 - considering a career as a gamer in the
03:35 - league of legends then contest strike
03:37 - but at some point it got me thinking
03:39 - that it may not be this thing right you
03:41 - were a gamer as well
03:43 - yeah i was like man i've been grinding
03:45 - games like
03:46 - when there was first season second
03:48 - season in league of legends i've been
03:49 - diamond and the diamond was the highest
03:51 - division so i've been killing it back in
03:53 - the days
03:54 - uh every day like 10 hours so on yeah
03:56 - that was like how i started
03:58 - then at some point i wanted to start to
04:00 - build my own games and man it's been so
04:02 - funny because then i went to a shop
04:04 - and i don't know it was a time when
04:07 - there was like a lot of those
04:08 - nice books and stuff like this uh those
04:10 - small shops
04:11 - so i got my hand on the first book and
04:13 - it was about building games
04:15 - and then i was like wow it's about
04:17 - building games using what
04:18 - uh it is i mean they introduced to some
04:21 - kind of a game builder so it was
04:23 - a lot of like blocks to put in so
04:26 - this is how i started building the it's
04:28 - it was i think rpg maker
04:30 - so you could literally build like a tbr
04:32 - game it's like a
04:33 - very old game um and yeah and then
04:36 - at some point there was like some kind
04:38 - of custom logic and it was
04:40 - all code and i was like wow what is it
04:43 - so you have to code stuff
04:44 - sort of like my first approach why did i
04:47 - have to learn
04:48 - here yeah exactly then that was like my
04:51 - first uh let's say touch and coding then
04:53 - and when i was
04:54 - around 11 or 12 i get myself into
04:58 - html a little bit and php but it was
05:00 - like literally nothing
05:02 - like a little bit of css so i started to
05:05 - know what
05:06 - it takes to build a website right but
05:09 - like
05:10 - to be honest the first time i really
05:12 - started to code like was in my last
05:14 - uh last year in high school
05:17 - because then i had we had a final test
05:19 - to get to university
05:21 - and uh we could choose between math
05:23 - physics uh
05:24 - also i t so i selected math and i t
05:27 - and this is how i started coding because
05:29 - i had to learn that and it's been it's
05:31 - been very fun but it was all just c
05:33 - and c plus plus so i was kind of also
05:35 - scared it wasn't i wasn't really
05:36 - motivated because
05:37 - it was just about pointers and
05:39 - allocating memory and man it
05:41 - it's been tough that is not fun at all
05:45 - not at all so then we went to like i
05:49 - went to
05:49 - uh college first year and we had this uh
05:53 - subject called python
05:54 - and not a lot of people were uh really
05:57 - into that but
05:58 - men jumping from a c to python when so
06:00 - many figures
06:01 - really nicely and nicely obstructed that
06:04 - you don't have to deal with allocating
06:05 - memory
06:06 - and pointers error i mean not really
06:08 - like there are also pointers in python
06:09 - but it's another story
06:11 - man it's been such a nice uh game
06:13 - changer for me
06:14 - because then i just i started to doing
06:16 - uh a lot about python just by myself
06:19 - right so i
06:20 - i checked like udemy courses and so on
06:22 - so and i was building my first software
06:23 - just
06:24 - for myself so i know other people were
06:27 - partying were
06:28 - doing some other stuff and i was just
06:29 - sitting in my room working and just
06:31 - coding
06:32 - i mean i was also a party guy of course
06:34 - oh this guy's
06:35 - a party guy too i know that are you
06:37 - kidding me
06:39 - but of course i mean in life you need
06:41 - need to have balance right like that's
06:43 - what i
06:44 - preach so of course when i go party i go
06:47 - party hard but
06:48 - it's usually after i do a really good
06:50 - accomplishment in my work so
06:52 - right just keeping the balance is very
06:54 - important but this is how i got into
06:55 - coding yeah
06:56 - so jacob so basically again so you went
06:59 - from c
06:59 - plus plus or from c up uh is that
07:01 - correct and
07:02 - your goal was that you kind of got into
07:04 - it because you know
07:06 - you were introduced to it through gaming
07:08 - right so you wanted to put the game
07:10 - and you started to you bought a book
07:12 - right and so forth and
07:14 - there was a lot of coding like holy
07:16 - what is this right at which point did
07:18 - you realize that okay this is
07:19 - interesting like this is something that
07:20 - i might want to do
07:23 - i mean to be honest uh like when i first
07:26 - touched those books with coding games
07:27 - uh i wasn't really interested then
07:29 - because i didn't understand really
07:31 - english and anything
07:32 - so it was very tough for me uh then then
07:35 - the same with html i didn't really know
07:37 - what i can do with it so i kind of
07:39 - put it away for a couple of years and
07:41 - then at high school
07:42 - when the whole coding fig got to me
07:45 - again then like also talking about i.t
07:47 - was very hot topic so i just got into it
07:50 - because
07:50 - at the end of the day i had to decide
07:52 - what will be my career path so at some
07:54 - point i wanted to be a doctor because i
07:56 - got really
07:57 - excited about biology but on the other
08:00 - hand i was always scared of blood so i
08:02 - was like no way i won't deal with that
08:04 - right but also i loved math and i think
08:07 - that
08:08 - i mean definitely c plus plus was always
08:10 - um like
08:12 - when i thought about c plus plus and
08:13 - there's case like and the
08:15 - algorithms which i learned and also like
08:17 - the tasks i
08:18 - solved they were really mathematical and
08:20 - especially in the beginning so this is
08:22 - how i got interested into that i was
08:23 - like okay let's
08:24 - try this more let's see what you can do
08:28 - and you can build with that and yeah
08:29 - again like the first university
08:32 - not really university itself but just
08:33 - the fact that i went to
08:35 - through a different like
08:39 - online courses this gave me actually a
08:41 - whole uh
08:42 - motivation to learn it really that's
08:45 - interesting wait
08:46 - so the online so the online courses
08:48 - which give you the motivation to
08:50 - to go for for what what line course did
08:52 - you take i'm curious
08:54 - was literally like some udemy free
08:57 - courses or some random youtube ones from
08:59 - python also like at some point i built a
09:02 - game in c
09:02 - plus plus uh that was a funny to go back
09:05 - into that
09:06 - because it was like university pro
09:07 - project and
09:09 - that was all about that right but the
09:10 - thing is that
09:12 - they didn't really teach this python
09:13 - university it was like literally
09:15 - like just trying it right
09:18 - but i was really at some like after my
09:20 - first year in
09:22 - university i was really motivated to
09:23 - actually get into the
09:25 - more and get my first job so man
09:28 - like usually no one gets internship
09:30 - after the first year
09:32 - of university but in my case i just i
09:35 - just wanted
09:36 - i just wanted it i i literally wanted it
09:39 - tell me why why did you want to
09:40 - because the thing is a lot of a lot of
09:42 - you know a lot of people what they might
09:43 - want to do is when they start out right
09:45 - they're like okay well i want to go to
09:46 - college i'm going to have some fun right
09:48 - i'm going gonna party it up you know
09:49 - maybe i'll learn a few things and so
09:51 - forth
09:51 - what kind of pushed you to know what to
09:53 - be like well you know what i kind of
09:55 - want to
09:56 - learn something i actually want to get a
09:58 - job in a way what was pushing to get a
10:00 - job were your parents pushing to get a
10:02 - job what was it
10:03 - not at all not my parents it's it's been
10:05 - more most
10:06 - also from my like kind of a goal in the
10:09 - life which was like
10:10 - okay so i'm from like i was born in
10:12 - germany but only i was born there and
10:14 - then i lived my whole life in poland i
10:15 - don't even
10:16 - speak german uh but at some point i
10:18 - always german
10:20 - yeah i mean a little bit a little bit
10:21 - but like literally you live in germany
10:23 - but you don't speak german
10:25 - yeah that's that's actually funny that's
10:26 - another story you don't have to do
10:28 - especially in the
10:29 - in it you should not be allowed to be
10:32 - there
10:33 - yeah yeah i mean i i can i can order a
10:36 - good dinner in german so
10:38 - that's what i need needed for but no
10:41 - like
10:41 - to be honest like at some point uh
10:44 - like i lived my whole life in poland and
10:47 - i will i've been abroad couple of times
10:49 - and it was always very exciting for me
10:51 - how people from all around the world
10:53 - they meet and they just talk in english
10:55 - uh and talk about their uh countries and
10:58 - so on like i've been always hyped
11:00 - for that and the year before starting my
11:02 - university i went for kind of like a
11:04 - a one month uh i don't know how to sell
11:07 - like a summer camp
11:08 - um to learn german and english and man
11:10 - it's been the best time in my life like
11:12 - i'm not gonna swear and i was so
11:13 - motivated
11:14 - that i said to myself okay i need to get
11:16 - internship but
11:18 - it cannot be internship in poland i
11:20 - wanna go abroad
11:21 - so at this point i mean i i was talking
11:23 - english like i was speaking english but
11:25 - it was
11:25 - quite bad but i was so motivated to do
11:27 - it that i applied for like 50 different
11:30 - companies in the germany man
11:31 - i failed to all of them literally i went
11:34 - through interviews i couldn't
11:36 - answer any questions like because my
11:38 - knowledge you apply yeah so you apply
11:40 - to all these companies somebody's saying
11:42 - couldn't talk that's funny good
11:45 - in the comments it's hilarious so i
11:48 - actually use it sometimes i
11:49 - just say good and tag you know but
11:51 - anyway so um you apply to all these
11:53 - different companies right without having
11:55 - any well i mean you had a little bit of
11:56 - knowledge to code it but not much at all
11:59 - yeah yeah exactly and it doesn't it
12:01 - didn't really matter for me which kind
12:02 - of a language was there like man i
12:04 - literally
12:05 - applied for all of the internships and i
12:06 - lied in my cv because at this point i
12:08 - only knew python
12:10 - i had nothing to tell about in my cv my
12:12 - cv looked like like i'm not gonna
12:13 - lie it was like black
12:14 - and white with my picture and i said
12:17 - okay i know python
12:18 - and i went through different courses on
12:20 - udemy and i'm motivated to do everything
12:22 - man that was my cv
12:23 - right so we mentioned this so come with
12:25 - us
12:26 - tell me this okay what did you lie about
12:29 - on
12:29 - what did you lie about on the what's it
12:31 - called on uh on you
12:33 - on your resume so it wasn't really lying
12:36 - in the resume
12:37 - but it was like okay i know how to code
12:39 - in python c plus plus java and
12:41 - javascript right but to be honest i only
12:43 - knew
12:43 - a little bit about python like i mean
12:46 - the c which i learned in the high school
12:48 - right it was just for solving algorithms
12:50 - it wasn't to build any products so i
12:52 - hope that i will learn i'll push myself
12:54 - through
12:55 - through it because when i'm working on
12:56 - the pressure i work better
12:58 - so yeah when i was actually the case by
13:00 - the way just so you guys know
13:01 - yeah i need to work i need to work under
13:03 - pressure yeah under pressure when you
13:05 - work under pressure
13:06 - you know that's why all we always say
13:07 - you know what you know build the project
13:09 - and so and so forth right the projects
13:11 - and what you're doing in
13:12 - in school whatever i might be doing
13:14 - that's just kind of getting you ready
13:15 - for the real thing right
13:17 - that's kind of because the end goal is
13:19 - always going to be to get a job
13:21 - that actually puts under pressure
13:23 - because why when you're in that job
13:25 - that's when you actually learn the most
13:27 - right when you're around people right
13:30 - that's when you learn the most
13:31 - so actually that's that's kind of the
13:33 - best part about that right so
13:35 - um yeah it's something that i think is
13:38 - very important to say to
13:39 - to those to those who are listening
13:41 - because a lot of you guys are thinking
13:42 - well you know
13:43 - you know how do i go ahead and get that
13:45 - first job and so forth right
13:47 - and what's the most important thing
13:48 - where well you know the real most
13:50 - surprising experience
13:51 - is going to be at the job right but
13:55 - what jacob did here very interestingly
13:57 - is you know
13:58 - even though he didn't have much
13:59 - experience he's still right
14:03 - zero experience did you how much c plus
14:06 - parts did you know tell me
14:08 - man i mean literally like i went to
14:10 - pointers and maybe vectors and that was
14:12 - it like i just knew a little bit about
14:13 - algorithms so i couldn't really build
14:15 - any application with it like it was all
14:17 - command line tools right
14:19 - maximum that so that was it but anyway
14:22 - right i applied to all of those
14:23 - companies i failed all of them but still
14:25 - i was like okay
14:26 - i want to learn german and english and
14:29 - work abroad
14:31 - i have i want to have my internship so i
14:32 - was like okay when they also speak in
14:34 - german oh there's austria so i played to
14:37 - austria man
14:38 - also 50 companies yeah like i was like
14:41 - let's do it
14:42 - i failed i felt i failed and there's
14:43 - this one company they
14:45 - i went through interview process uh i i
14:48 - asked
14:49 - like i answered a couple of questions
14:51 - and then uh
14:52 - they said man like they called me after
14:54 - a few days that yeah you in i was like
14:56 - no but then and then i was like i
14:59 - was like super excited and then
15:01 - i asked what we will be doing there on
15:03 - during this internship man
15:05 - the lady was talking to me for like 20
15:08 - minutes and i couldn't understand
15:10 - anything out of it i was like yeah yeah
15:11 - okay sounds
15:12 - interesting yeah i totally know until
15:14 - again all this you just couldn't
15:15 - you know i totally know i got this i've
15:17 - done this before no problem so ever
15:19 - can you see for you guys in about one
15:21 - week okay no don't have to worry about
15:22 - this whatsoever right so
15:24 - that's funny at this point i was so
15:26 - excited that
15:28 - i was like yeah i'm going there so i
15:30 - went there uh alone actually like it was
15:32 - like
15:32 - 1 000 kilometers from my hometown i
15:34 - didn't know anyone also in this
15:36 - city i would actually it was in the
15:38 - salzburg it's very nice
15:40 - city in austria the company was named
15:42 - skidata
15:44 - actually they are really big in west
15:46 - europe
15:47 - and yeah the internship like the problem
15:50 - with the
15:50 - internship was that i was about to
15:53 - reboot and
15:54 - build extension to the app which was
15:56 - already there and the app was built
15:58 - in uh java and in the framework called
16:01 - spring
16:02 - man when i saw that when i saw it
16:05 - i was literally shooting my pants man i
16:07 - didn't know what to do like i
16:08 - literally i literally
16:13 - so why i i couldn't understand anything
16:16 - out of it
16:17 - again my english wasn't very good but i
16:20 - had my own boss right
16:21 - so literally for seven days i was
16:24 - researching everything about java
16:26 - about this framework and after work so i
16:29 - was doing there
16:30 - i was working there eight hours even
16:32 - more then i was going home i was
16:34 - doing research more and more because at
16:35 - some point i was like wow they would
16:36 - just kick me from the intern
16:38 - internship and after seven days uh i
16:41 - literally gave up and i said
16:42 - hey look um i think like that
16:46 - i won't be able to build that like this
16:49 - java framework spring is just it's too
16:52 - much for me and
16:53 - to be honest i have the most experience
16:55 - with python
16:56 - and i was very lucky because my my boss
16:59 - actually understood that
17:00 - and he said okay look jacob really uh
17:02 - yeah this is like a code base
17:04 - it doesn't have to be coded in this
17:06 - framework i understand that this might
17:08 - be tough especially that is your first
17:09 - job
17:10 - and we want you to bring you like give
17:12 - you as much experience
17:14 - and show you processes as we can so
17:17 - uh he said he suggested that okay use
17:19 - your framework
17:20 - to build that right and i was like okay
17:22 - i was literally googling how to
17:24 - build python application a web
17:26 - application because
17:27 - it was a web application then i
17:28 - discovered django man and i i literally
17:31 - for i was there almost uh three months i
17:34 - literally learned like
17:35 - a very solid uh jungle base
17:39 - i would say and i rebuilt the whole
17:40 - thing for them and in the end they were
17:42 - really
17:42 - uh really happy with that so i
17:44 - accomplished my internship
17:46 - that's crazy so you rebuilt their whole
17:48 - project so basically they initially they
17:50 - give you
17:51 - they give this to you in java and you're
17:53 - like holy i literally can't do this
17:54 - which
17:55 - by the way i just want to say it takes a
17:56 - lot of gusts to come to to come up to
17:58 - someone and say i can't do it
18:00 - right the problem becomes is a lot of
18:02 - people say that
18:03 - oh i can't i can't i can't i can't do
18:04 - right and they get into this mindset of
18:07 - being afraid to say that something they
18:09 - can't and so they lie
18:11 - and they lie and the thing is that
18:13 - people on the other hand
18:15 - they can see you lying so badly
18:18 - sometimes like because i do interviews
18:20 - with a lot of people right
18:21 - and i can see when people lie like i
18:24 - interview people
18:24 - interview developers i can see when
18:26 - you're lying
18:28 - i'll sometimes in my mind i just want to
18:30 - say listen just tell me you don't know
18:32 - or just tell me that you can't and we'll
18:35 - figure this out together
18:37 - you see what i mean and it's a sad part
18:39 - about this
18:41 - right but it's all about communication
18:44 - right
18:44 - it's all about communication exactly
18:46 - what it is very brave you went ahead and
18:48 - you actually basically you told them hey
18:49 - you know what
18:50 - i'm going to go ahead and say i can't do
18:53 - this but here's the solution but we can
18:55 - try in a different
18:56 - manner so we actually came up with a
18:58 - different solution right which was
19:00 - the jingle with python correct and i
19:03 - rebuilded the whole thing
19:04 - from scratch because again he already
19:06 - had a coast base in the spring
19:07 - and i had to extend that i was like
19:09 - there's no way i'll extend that so i'll
19:11 - build
19:11 - whole thing which was already there from
19:13 - scratch and then on top of that i'll bet
19:15 - on other features and yeah
19:17 - through those months it worked out and
19:19 - it was really good because we just had a
19:21 - date daily meetings when he was just
19:23 - talking about those features and i was
19:24 - like brainstorming with him man like
19:26 - it's been
19:27 - the best experience in my life uh
19:30 - regarding like starting a job as a
19:31 - as a developer it really gave me that
19:33 - boost later on in the
19:34 - getting the new job like i've never had
19:36 - a problem to get a new job
19:38 - because after that when i quit uh
19:40 - university because like that's a funny
19:41 - story that right after this internship
19:43 - i remember you quit university is that
19:45 - correct yeah
19:46 - right after this internship i came back
19:49 - to university
19:50 - and man it's been so boring because i
19:52 - had all of this experience being
19:54 - abroad alone meeting those people
19:56 - working the international
19:57 - team uh also like man i i earned
20:01 - in the end almost 6k like i've never
20:03 - earned money before in my life and then
20:05 - it's just 6k like that it was it was
20:07 - just crazy for me
20:08 - of course i had to pay for like a flood
20:11 - and so on
20:12 - but it was all worth it for all those
20:13 - experiences
20:15 - [Music]
20:17 - yeah but then being in a university uh
20:20 - on all of those like uh
20:21 - classes and so on i just couldn't stand
20:23 - it anymore because i already started
20:25 - working in the industry
20:26 - and i saw what is necessary to build
20:28 - stuff give value to companies
20:30 - and then they will learn they were
20:32 - teaching us this all and i was like
20:34 - man i can't stand it i was talking to my
20:36 - friend literally i was shaking
20:37 - and i was like man i can't i can't be
20:39 - here i can't stand it i don't know what
20:40 - i will do i
20:41 - i just don't want to be here and at some
20:43 - point i stood up and i just went
20:45 - like sorry what were you learning there
20:49 - like i can't stand it yeah we we were
20:50 - learning java
20:52 - so again java and there was like some
20:54 - old libraries
20:55 - object programming languages uh then
20:59 - like very like we didn't even touch web
21:01 - dev there was like the next year
21:03 - and there was like a lot of those boring
21:06 - uh usual
21:06 - useless subjects with like building some
21:10 - things from like this micro
21:11 - electro like i can i don't know it's the
21:14 - english name for it but you just had to
21:16 - connect a few cables and build some
21:18 - stuff just like man i wasn't interested
21:19 - in this at all i wanted to learn
21:21 - a tools how to program i wanted to
21:25 - new new and the newest frameworks that
21:28 - was another case that they were
21:29 - teaching you all of those old frameworks
21:31 - because they couldn't
21:32 - uh hire professors who are also
21:35 - developers who are working the industry
21:37 - right
21:38 - so this this knowledge i just realized
21:41 - it's all useless of course you will you
21:42 - will
21:43 - get through all of those very tough
21:45 - algorithms
21:46 - and by finishing this university to be
21:49 - honest you will just learn how to learn
21:51 - anything in your freaking life right so
21:52 - once you get the
21:53 - job in the company you'll just survive
21:55 - there because man you just
21:56 - learn the toughest in your college
21:58 - so you will survive of course this is
22:00 - how it works but why don't take a
22:02 - shortcut if you know what to do
22:04 - so i was also passionate about business
22:06 - side always like my whole life
22:08 - and it was never introduced there like
22:11 - at all never zero
22:12 - zero like i always wanted to talk about
22:14 - numbers
22:15 - and stuff like this yeah there was
22:17 - nothing to do like that so i really
22:18 - wanted to
22:19 - get straight into industry so that's why
22:21 - i literally quit
22:22 - then i landed two jobs i picked one and
22:25 - it was like yeah
22:26 - let's go that's awesome i mean look i
22:28 - think that's amazing because like
22:29 - even it just shows that how much what
22:31 - you can do with so
22:33 - little experience right there are jobs
22:35 - that will take you with little
22:36 - experience
22:37 - a lot of you guys and those are in the
22:38 - comments right
22:40 - let us know in the comments if you're
22:42 - somebody who's looking for a job or
22:43 - maybe you
22:44 - want to become a developer right and
22:46 - you're just you're
22:48 - you don't know where to go you're
22:49 - confused right maybe a situation maybe
22:51 - you're stuck in tutorial hell you don't
22:52 - know where to go right
22:54 - whatever it might be let us know in the
22:55 - comments below right but
22:57 - what jacob here can tell you is that
23:00 - even though you might not have
23:01 - much experience there's companies out
23:03 - there that will help you out that will
23:05 - take care of you
23:06 - right the they give you the opportunity
23:08 - let me ask you this question okay
23:11 - why do you think they hired you
23:15 - i think it was uh about my approach they
23:17 - really
23:18 - see that i won it like right now they
23:20 - still
23:21 - they really they really saw that i have
23:23 - the guts to quit university and like
23:25 - work and learn the industry more i also
23:27 - told them and
23:28 - just like the encoding interview because
23:31 - i also had to pass the coding interview
23:33 - so
23:33 - it was a job also related to django
23:36 - because i already know the basics but
23:37 - man it's it's been nothing like
23:39 - the stuff i learned here there in the
23:41 - company it was all i
23:42 - learned so i literally didn't know the
23:44 - difference between get and post requests
23:46 - but i just made the app work at some
23:48 - point man when i check
23:49 - the code base it's also my github man
23:52 - it's
23:53 - it's really messy like i didn't know
23:55 - what to do at all they
23:56 - there was like four and a four into four
23:58 - into four like literally
24:01 - oh yeah that was like that in the
24:02 - beginning so then when i
24:04 - was on the coding interview there was a
24:06 - framework to django which just is
24:08 - responsible for building the api which
24:10 - is django res framework and they were
24:12 - coding mostly into that because they had
24:13 - there was a separate team for front and
24:15 - back end right so you just
24:17 - were about to build back-end so they
24:19 - gave me a task
24:20 - and i was like the same i was writing
24:22 - documentation checking the examples
24:24 - and i spent one day with them uh and i
24:27 - solved
24:28 - i solved the whole thing how they wanted
24:30 - but of course it wasn't it wasn't right
24:32 - but they saw this potential how fast i
24:34 - can learn and how good i can communicate
24:36 - with the team because this is also
24:37 - a case that whenever you are freaking
24:40 - good at coding it doesn't mean you are
24:41 - freaking good developer because good
24:44 - developers like
24:46 - when i hire people right now what i
24:47 - really care is not how good you code but
24:49 - how good
24:50 - you can communicate uh especially from
24:53 - the business side
24:54 - when i have when i have a client here's
24:55 - an idea and he wants to talk to
24:57 - developer there's no way
24:58 - they will talk to each other there's no
25:00 - way um they
25:02 - they speak literally at different
25:03 - languages
25:06 - right and it's not just about how good
25:08 - you can code it's also about how good
25:10 - you can smash that like button
25:15 - smash that like button button for the
25:17 - youtube algorithm right that also
25:19 - matters
25:20 - but yeah like it's not just about how
25:22 - well you can i
25:24 - really like the pension that's really
25:25 - cool that was graham stefan type
25:27 - situation you know
25:28 - um yeah yeah yeah so basically you know
25:32 - it's like um
25:33 - it's not just about how good you can
25:34 - cope it's all about your passion and
25:36 - about
25:36 - how good you can learn correct well you
25:39 - show them the fact that
25:40 - you are willing to learn
25:43 - right but what i'm curious that's
25:44 - totally true what's up
25:46 - go ahead uh yeah that's not really true
25:48 - but i also wanted to mention one thing
25:49 - which you
25:50 - brought which is a coding uh tutorial
25:52 - and pro
25:53 - pro like project cell and so on this is
25:55 - why i also really wanted to
25:57 - because at this point i had a gap year
25:58 - right because i quit a university and i
26:00 - wanted to go abroad so i applied to this
26:02 - university where i'm currently but i
26:03 - wanted to work
26:04 - for all time to get the experience and i
26:07 - could
26:08 - choose two ways right i could choose a
26:10 - first way when i just learn technologies
26:12 - i learn
26:13 - and build projects right so i go
26:15 - tutorial of the tutorial but man
26:17 - i don't think it's the case to really
26:19 - get experience you really need to work
26:21 - inside that commercial project because
26:24 - this is where the real users are
26:25 - and they give you the feedback so it's
26:27 - totally different way i i don't
26:29 - recommend you guys
26:30 - like literally don't build project after
26:32 - project
26:34 - my approach is that literally getting to
26:36 - freelancing if you can't land
26:38 - a job and try to build something for
26:40 - someone because this will
26:42 - bring you a lot of experience you will
26:44 - really learn how to
26:46 - uh like build tough stuff and you will
26:48 - be under pressure
26:50 - that's what i would choose right now for
26:52 - about to start
26:53 - yeah now i would just tell to somebody
26:56 - who was like
26:58 - it's wanted to say hey no you go ahead
26:59 - and start out with very simply like just
27:01 - like this it's one thing to say that
27:03 - but it's a whole other thing to actually
27:06 - go ahead
27:06 - and and actually do it that's the
27:09 - hardest thing because a lot of people
27:10 - feel like well you know what
27:12 - i'm not ready they have the imposter
27:13 - syndrome and it makes sense because you
27:15 - really are not ready you don't know the
27:17 - the knowledge behind it right so what
27:20 - kind of a mindset do you have to have to
27:22 - be like no no i'm gonna get started no
27:23 - matter what
27:24 - and i kind of see where it takes me
27:26 - because i interviewed blake connolly as
27:28 - well and he had that same mindset
27:31 - right he started kind of freelancing
27:33 - very much from the get-go without
27:35 - thinking about so much
27:36 - about you know the future instead he
27:39 - just kind of still
27:40 - started to start doing the work and then
27:42 - after that he just kind of learned on
27:44 - the fly
27:46 - exactly i mean there are different kind
27:47 - of people so there are people who just
27:49 - prefer to
27:50 - learn learn learn and just talk about it
27:52 - and there are people who
27:54 - in order to learn they just act they
27:56 - learn through experience and this is my
27:58 - way to do it and
27:59 - i can only say the same regarding the
28:02 - current business which we run right
28:03 - which we go
28:04 - to uh soon again like same story so
28:08 - about coding now it's also about like
28:10 - calisthenics which i'm doing
28:11 - before i was just reading about
28:13 - exercising that but at some point i just
28:15 - sign up for like very
28:16 - experienced group when man like i work
28:19 - with the people who are doing
28:20 - calisthenics for like five seven years
28:22 - i'm the worst there but it's been the
28:24 - best experience ever
28:26 - i mean i'm every day i feel like i i'm
28:28 - literally dying i can't get up from bed
28:30 - but it's the best
28:31 - so really whenever you do in your life
28:35 - i would whenever you want to accomplish
28:37 - something in your life i would literally
28:39 - do it by like accomplish it by doing
28:42 - no matter what does it take of course
28:44 - you will fail and you'll feel very bad
28:46 - in a lot of moment but this is where the
28:48 - all growth comes
28:49 - right yeah that is true that is true i
28:52 - agree i give failure is a big very big
28:54 - part
28:54 - of growth you know we need to do that
28:56 - before we move on so so
28:58 - i understand so you went basically you
28:59 - went to this company correct and this
29:01 - what do you know the name of this
29:02 - company yeah it's kv software company in
29:05 - poznan and i
29:06 - if anyone from the kiwi watches me i
29:08 - greet you guys it's been
29:10 - great time there i mean i got so much
29:13 - experience from it like literally been
29:14 - it's been the best thing that happened
29:16 - to me
29:17 - wow that's amazing this has a lot to say
29:19 - that that's amazing
29:20 - awesome so now in that case that's cool
29:23 - now in that case
29:24 - so after that right you went to this
29:26 - internship and then
29:27 - what kind of happened then right you're
29:29 - working the jingle project how
29:31 - how did you feel now at this point
29:33 - working and like
29:34 - how do you feel like your knowledge was
29:36 - at a point after like a month or two of
29:38 - working in the company
29:39 - i mean it's the first internship so i
29:41 - when i finished internship to be honest
29:43 - yeah i was all shitty
29:44 - still but i had the experience then the
29:46 - company i worked there almost a year
29:47 - and yeah after this year i i was really
29:50 - solid to be honest because it was just
29:52 - djangour's framework all the time um
29:55 - yeah at this point i felt very solid
29:57 - it's still like i
29:58 - i couldn't say i'm the the expert right
30:02 - but it was also a small company that was
30:04 - what was the beautiful thing about that
30:06 - because we just had to get done
30:09 - and most of the times i was literally
30:11 - putting to the huge project and i had to
30:14 - do stuff so it was also a great
30:16 - experience for me
30:17 - and after that like when i moved to
30:19 - germany i also applied
30:20 - uh so then i also like get to the next
30:22 - university and i applied to different
30:24 - companies the funny part is in germany
30:26 - when you're a student you can only work
30:28 - uh 20 hours per week this is a german
30:30 - law really on the contract student on a
30:32 - contract
30:32 - so interesting now it's different
30:35 - because i own my
30:36 - compa own company um so it's different
30:39 - uh so you're a baller now you're like
30:40 - i don't play with the rules now now i
30:43 - mean i just still have to
30:45 - say that i work 20 hours per week
30:46 - because you can't really tell
30:48 - that's a trick in germany
30:51 - i mean right now i have two companies to
30:53 - be honest so one is there's a poland
30:55 - when i'm the
30:55 - co-founder like co-owner and then the
30:57 - second single person company in germany
31:00 - when i just do invoices and stuff and
31:03 - so that's how we run it right now but
31:05 - let me tell you about the
31:06 - the funny story about the companies when
31:10 - i applied as a student so i got
31:12 - this university and i already had like a
31:14 - nice experience to get at the company so
31:16 - i applied already to
31:17 - as a mid developer everywhere uh full
31:20 - time
31:20 - and i was going for different uh coding
31:23 - interviews men they were
31:24 - really tough but there was a those these
31:26 - were like positions for like 60 70k
31:29 - euros
31:30 - a year and i passed through different uh
31:33 - coding interviews
31:34 - and there was like the last uh stage
31:37 - when i had to go only through hr thing
31:40 - uh hr interview and man it was all great
31:43 - it was all perfect and in the end i said
31:45 - hey do you have an option to like work
31:48 - 20 hours per week because you see i'm a
31:49 - student
31:51 - and they were shocked they were
31:53 - literally shocked they literally
31:55 - declined me there
31:56 - so at some point i applied also for a
31:58 - different company when they also had
32:00 - their student offer
32:02 - but i got like much more uh salary than
32:04 - a regular student because i applied for
32:06 - also like a different position that was
32:08 - like a
32:09 - tricky hack that i did but again after
32:11 - like
32:12 - seven to eight months i think that was
32:14 - also like a clever programmer
32:16 - uh and then team of clever programmer
32:18 - then i was also like a little bit
32:19 - freelancing
32:20 - at some point as i you remember probably
32:23 - this day i
32:24 - i came up when i called and i said hey
32:25 - guys it's been a great time but
32:28 - i just can't do it anymore because it's
32:31 - like i'm doing almost three jobs
32:33 - i'm studying and
32:36 - it's i just can't i just wanna quit
32:38 - everything yeah
32:39 - restart my whole brain and i already
32:42 - knew that
32:43 - i love business and i want to do
32:44 - something with business yeah
32:46 - so i took vacation yeah yeah and i
32:49 - remember i remember this like
32:51 - uh i remember this very clearly right
32:53 - because
32:54 - you were doing a lot of things you're
32:55 - working with us right you're working
32:57 - with us and
32:58 - you know you're working with us on you
33:00 - know with profit python
33:01 - and of course and just and a lot of
33:04 - different things like challenges and so
33:06 - forth
33:06 - um which was amazing of course and
33:09 - you're a big part of the team
33:11 - um but i know you were doing a lot of
33:13 - different things you had you had an
33:14 - internship that you were working at the
33:15 - same time right
33:16 - plus this also and i think you also did
33:19 - school is that correct or no you're not
33:21 - yeah exactly exactly and also like my
33:23 - own youtube and my own instagram man
33:24 - i've been like
33:25 - it's been like crazy every day like 11
33:28 - 12 hours but but you know what sometimes
33:30 - you gotta do a lot because like
33:32 - you know a lot of people problems is
33:34 - they don't do enough you see what i mean
33:39 - you're doing a lot correct and you can
33:40 - and then you figure out how to slow down
33:44 - is that correct exactly right exactly i
33:46 - just had to reflect on myself because i
33:48 - knew
33:48 - that when you do everything you can't do
33:52 - everything good right so i was like i
33:55 - have so many ideas
33:57 - i wanted to do business i love also like
33:59 - being on a team record
34:01 - videos uh coach other people also i love
34:04 - to code but
34:05 - i just can't do anything there's not
34:07 - enough time and i will just burn out
34:09 - at some point i already had a couple of
34:10 - burnouts uh not like a huge burners but
34:13 - like i just couldn't
34:14 - look at the screen anymore right so yeah
34:16 - i took the decision it's been very tough
34:19 - uh because like i literally quit
34:21 - everything and one day
34:22 - that was very hard what is everything
34:24 - everything what do you mean by
34:25 - everything
34:26 - yeah so i quit working for this one
34:28 - client
34:29 - i quit uh this part-time job in the
34:32 - company i also like i
34:33 - i was like they really liked me i really
34:35 - like it was a really great team
34:36 - so and they're also working with you
34:38 - guys it was also like very
34:40 - uh like nice experience for me i really
34:43 - love that
34:44 - yeah i just show up on every like
34:45 - meeting and i just had to say that
34:47 - yeah this is how it is i i quit and then
34:50 - i had like literally two weeks
34:52 - do enough and just chill and it was
34:54 - great it was really necessary
34:56 - and then of course at some point you
34:58 - just if you do so many things that you
35:00 - take vacation at some point
35:02 - you you are so chill that those ideas
35:04 - are coming again to you right you are so
35:06 - relaxed and men
35:08 - that was a first idea when which was
35:10 - born that i wanna be a freelancer right
35:12 - now i think it's a great thing to do
35:14 - then my co-founder wojtek he had the
35:17 - same idea that he would quit his job
35:19 - he will become a freelancer and then at
35:21 - this point it was so funny because we
35:23 - were like
35:23 - hey man i mean we can freelance together
35:25 - hey isn't it like agency or something
35:32 - maybe we could do something together who
35:34 - knows exactly so we
35:36 - team up and man it that was just the
35:38 - beginning it was it was great
35:40 - that's awesome that's awesome and so
35:42 - hold on so i kind of want to kind of
35:44 - want to even step back a little bit from
35:45 - that right because like
35:46 - you went into this right and you kind of
35:50 - quit everything that you were doing
35:51 - right
35:52 - all these different jobs and so forth
35:54 - and
35:55 - was it really because you want to do
35:57 - something different or was it because
35:59 - you were just tired and needed a break
36:03 - it wasn't really about being tired i
36:05 - could i could do that
36:06 - um definitely it was just something in
36:09 - my
36:10 - inside me talking to myself that i want
36:12 - to build something on my own
36:14 - i just i don't know i just felt this
36:17 - this way that whenever
36:18 - i work on something i just i love that
36:20 - it's it's like
36:21 - mine it's for example right i built my
36:24 - own instagram
36:25 - even though i was doing doing a lot of
36:27 - things for clever programming i was
36:28 - still doing this because
36:29 - it felt like it's literally like my
36:31 - thing it's it's me it's my personal
36:33 - brand
36:33 - and now company same thing right now of
36:36 - course we are doing custom projects for
36:38 - a client so it's like kind of
36:40 - we still have a boss our boss our our
36:43 - bosses are our clients
36:44 - i would say so right it's it's we
36:47 - exchange time for money for them but at
36:50 - the same time
36:51 - we are building a brand self-made
36:54 - and we are building the crm we are
36:56 - building a client base so whenever we
36:58 - have i don't know in three years let's
37:00 - say 100 clients
37:01 - this is recurring income already right
37:03 - the maintenance the new features this is
37:05 - this is already a thing we are building
37:07 - a developer team
37:09 - uh designer team this is all like a
37:11 - asset
37:12 - for us uh so go ahead
37:16 - yeah this is like a different like my
37:18 - mindset this is why i really enjoy that
37:19 - i really feel that i wanna do something
37:21 - like that
37:22 - that's awesome that's amazing and so
37:24 - okay so then you decide to basically
37:25 - quit everything
37:26 - you and you're like you know what i'm
37:27 - gonna start a software agency okay
37:30 - so let's get into that right what
37:33 - happened there
37:34 - how did you get started what are the
37:36 - first things that you
37:37 - did to go ahead and get started on
37:39 - something like this tell me
37:41 - man it's been a mess so i photo so i i
37:44 - already had like
37:45 - 30 or 40 000 instagram followers
37:48 - like three thousand youtube youtuber
37:50 - right and i was like wow i know a lot
37:52 - about marketing
37:54 - it it would be probably easy to get the
37:56 - first clients and so on man i would be
37:57 - killing it
37:58 - i was so like i know cocky
38:03 - yeah okay yeah maybe also
38:06 - uh but no to be honest man it's been
38:09 - much
38:10 - harder than i thought like it turned out
38:11 - that instagram or other social medias
38:14 - they are usually usually perfect for
38:16 - b2c which is a business to clients so
38:18 - when you have a product
38:20 - and you sell them to typical people
38:22 - those are your clients then it's not
38:23 - customers
38:24 - and customers yeah yeah then it's
38:27 - usually also the product is not that
38:28 - expensive
38:29 - uh but you can scale it easily but when
38:32 - you
38:32 - run your agency then you do bit b2b
38:35 - which is business to business
38:36 - business to business and i did a
38:39 - research i checked the agency so it's
38:40 - like hey man they have no instagrams
38:41 - they know facebook but then they have
38:43 - those big brands working with i was like
38:45 - how do they do that right and then i
38:46 - started re reading about it and i was
38:48 - like wow b2b
38:50 - is totally different game i have no idea
38:52 - about that and
38:53 - also like the thing where we started the
38:56 - agency with wojtek
38:57 - uh we both had savings for like two
39:00 - maybe three months
39:01 - because i also pay for my uni i pay for
39:03 - my flood and stuff like this
39:04 - so yeah i had some savings it was also
39:07 - like why i quit was like okay now i
39:09 - literally have a savings
39:11 - for next two three months so
39:14 - i really i mean i will figure it out
39:16 - because i know myself under the pressure
39:18 - if i have this pressure
39:19 - and yeah at some point i won't have any
39:21 - money i mean man
39:22 - yeah i would go back to different job
39:24 - like i have this safety that i can
39:26 - always come back to the job but now i
39:28 - want to do something more
39:29 - so this is how it was born and yeah
39:31 - we're just starting to asking people
39:33 - literally hey you are freelancers we
39:35 - want to be freelancers or like agency
39:38 - so you start getting go ahead yes
39:41 - yeah as well as to say uh who and uh
39:43 - stuff like this so like that was the
39:44 - first step
39:45 - like reading online articles how to
39:48 - freelance how to the clients
39:50 - and then also literally talking to the
39:52 - people and i'm not gonna
39:53 - i'm not gonna lie uh actually blake
39:55 - connelly was
39:56 - one of my best inspirations because like
39:59 - i knew already uh him from instagram
40:01 - like i knew that you guys were working
40:02 - together i literally asked him for like
40:04 - one
40:05 - quick interview for like 20 30 minutes
40:07 - and he agreed on that which is like
40:09 - crazy like i literally was like willing
40:11 - to pay him for this time because i know
40:13 - how much he works how many important
40:15 - things he has to do
40:16 - and yeah he agreed and then he
40:18 - introduced us the upwork
40:19 - the upwork whole upwork game and he said
40:22 - it will be very hard like
40:24 - he mentioned that a couple of times but
40:26 - we we still didn't really believe that
40:28 - it can be that hard and then we
40:29 - went to our pork man
40:33 - it's been so hard like like literally we
40:36 - actually had like both this
40:37 - nice experience is almost like 2.5
40:40 - almost three years of experience working
40:42 - the industry
40:43 - right and we went to upwork and man to
40:45 - lend our first client
40:48 - it's been literally like a grinding like
40:50 - 20 days
40:51 - 5 to 10 proposals every single day wow
40:54 - and we couldn't even get to anyone
40:57 - to answer our proposal because on upwork
41:00 - you have
41:00 - a few stages so first you need to find a
41:02 - client you need to send him the proposal
41:05 - he need to text you back then you kind
41:07 - of get on a call
41:08 - and then you have to close him so it's
41:10 - like a long process right to close
41:11 - someone
41:12 - and all and whenever someone um
41:15 - like posts a job
41:19 - offer um like after like one hour i
41:22 - don't think it's even worth to apply
41:23 - applying there because there's like
41:24 - already 20 other people applied right
41:27 - so it's very hard it's very hard to be
41:29 - noticed especially in the beginning
41:30 - where you have no badges
41:31 - no job successes no income earned
41:34 - there's like
41:35 - literally the hardest part on upwork so
41:37 - wow
41:38 - we made it actually we made it after i
41:40 - don't know two or three weeks
41:42 - um i landed the first guy it was
41:45 - something about
41:46 - amazon automation it was the first time
41:49 - first client and it was like okay i
41:51 - have no idea about amazon
41:53 - automation that they have api i was like
41:55 - i'm doing this
41:56 - i'm doing this so we got on a call
41:58 - figure it out he told me
42:00 - yeah yeah i will figure it out man i
42:01 - have to um so he told me about this
42:04 - amazon nws thing there was like a
42:06 - documentation
42:07 - he said what he wants there's also
42:09 - something about gcp which is google out
42:11 - platform
42:12 - and i was like okay let's do it and yeah
42:14 - i was working extremely hard for like
42:17 - two or three weeks and i earned like
42:18 - five hundred dollars which is like
42:20 - literally nothing as a developer for
42:21 - this kind of time but man
42:23 - i mean that's a thing right right
42:27 - sorry 500 in two weeks
42:31 - almost free so it was very tough working
42:34 - like crazy but man
42:35 - i've never was happier like that was
42:38 - literally like this 500 dollars fit like
42:41 - i know
42:42 - 10k right now or something like that
42:43 - it's it's been crazy
42:45 - how happy i was was because then i had a
42:47 - very nice comment on my profile
42:49 - uh 100 job succeed and i also got some
42:52 - batch from upwork
42:54 - so so so so tell me this tell me this
42:56 - okay what do you think allowed you to
42:58 - get this client okay
43:00 - like what was it is it the proposal that
43:03 - you made because of course you've been
43:04 - in proposals for the best to pass two
43:06 - three weeks at this point right
43:07 - but what you what got you that client
43:10 - tell me
43:11 - uh so yeah there are a couple of things
43:13 - tonight this is also how i like
43:14 - learned for to them this is actually
43:17 - after two weeks because we already like
43:18 - even buy those
43:20 - points on upwork that you can actually
43:21 - send more proposals so like we spend
43:23 - like 10 bucks or 20 bucks
43:24 - to even land a client uh so yeah what we
43:27 - learned uh
43:28 - in the beginning is that that your
43:30 - proposal needs to be extremely unique
43:32 - and gives a lot of value in the
43:34 - beginning like literally
43:36 - we kind of figure out this formula that
43:38 - when you send the up
43:40 - upwork proposal in this proposal you
43:43 - kind of need to give the guy solution
43:44 - so once we apply this pattern it really
43:48 - started working out like literally we
43:49 - got like 50 uh
43:51 - answers after that so the guy wanted to
43:53 - do some google amazon nws
43:55 - i sent him the python library
43:58 - link to github that hey this is a pi
44:00 - this library i think we can
44:02 - use that and then i think we can deploy
44:04 - the app on the gcp
44:05 - and i also link this stuff and yeah i
44:08 - just wrote him like that and he was like
44:10 - oh man you look like you have some kind
44:11 - of experience
44:12 - there and there let's talk and then he
44:14 - he got on a talk with me
44:15 - i talked about the experience and
44:17 - situation man
44:19 - because he said yeah i i'm not gonna lie
44:20 - it's like you are new here you don't
44:22 - have any
44:23 - uh stars and anything i'm kind of like i
44:26 - don't know if i should trust you but i
44:27 - mean looks like you you're fine so let's
44:30 - do it
44:30 - so he also i was lucky i was lucky he
44:32 - also wanted to help me
44:34 - right and the same happened to vojtec
44:35 - when we both applied this formula so we
44:37 - kind of get on upward i don't know maybe
44:39 - to 10
44:40 - 000 overall earnings but at some point
44:43 - we didn't really like it
44:44 - and the reason is that from my point
44:47 - because i i didn't really like it
44:48 - because
44:49 - uh i'm really shitty when it comes to
44:51 - texting like writing
44:52 - to people i'm better with talking and
44:56 - on upwork you have to be really good at
44:57 - texting so voider at some point was
44:59 - getting a lot of
45:00 - different clients but i couldn't so i
45:03 - was like okay let's switch
45:05 - the model business model again
45:08 - and then uh our second stage of this
45:12 - but before before you go into that
45:13 - before you go into that okay
45:15 - so you were doing upwork and so forth
45:17 - and you said that you were able to earn
45:19 - around ten thousand dollars on upwork is
45:21 - that what you said
45:22 - um it was in the first month overall
45:24 - overall because we are doing this upper
45:26 - thing also
45:27 - from time so we have like uh me and
45:28 - voitek together i think it might be 10k
45:30 - but
45:31 - probably less but yeah this is we got it
45:34 - after like two or three months so we
45:36 - could literally do it
45:37 - all the time but only the reason why uh
45:40 - i didn't want to do it because i had to
45:41 - text to people and i had it so
45:44 - overall nothing against upwork i think
45:45 - it's a great platform especially for
45:47 - freelancers also if you want to
45:49 - do an agency it's really good like we
45:51 - could be a really good agency there
45:52 - i know that blake earns like crazy on
45:55 - upwork and it works
45:56 - uh but yeah again it depends on the
45:58 - personality uh
46:00 - i prefer to go to people i prefer to
46:02 - meet people in person
46:04 - in order to close them um i feel like
46:06 - also i'm much better in this so
46:08 - that's why we changed that that comes to
46:10 - me to another question because
46:12 - somebody asked for they asked why don't
46:14 - you look for clients locally
46:18 - yeah this is another this is actually
46:20 - stage two of uh
46:21 - self-made so yeah this is what we did so
46:25 - we asked okay how can we get clients
46:28 - again so
46:28 - i already had couple of nice connections
46:31 - on actually through
46:32 - which i made through instagram in berlin
46:34 - and people were freelancing or they own
46:36 - their own agencies and i was going to
46:37 - them and i was just talking to them
46:39 - uh and there was hendrick from milli and
46:42 - he always talked to me that hey man
46:44 - try to reach out to your network but my
46:46 - problem is that
46:47 - i just moved to berlin right like one
46:50 - year ago or something i was starting
46:51 - then the corona
46:52 - started i didn't have any network at all
46:55 - my parents are not
46:57 - any like i.t technicians or anything my
46:59 - mother is the teacher
47:00 - so they know nothing we don't have any
47:03 - connection poland
47:04 - uh but also like we didn't want to do it
47:06 - in poland at this point
47:07 - we just wanted to be here in germany and
47:10 - work for german clients so
47:11 - yeah we didn't have any network but i
47:13 - was like okay let's do it anyway
47:15 - and then i literally was going online on
47:17 - different slack communities especially
47:19 - like the
47:19 - co-working space which i i'm right now
47:21 - and i was talking to people a lot
47:23 - and then those guys they got to us
47:26 - and we started the first collaboration
47:28 - then there was a second guy who
47:30 - reached out to us uh he was working for
47:32 - some company who is doing a hand
47:34 - handmade letters but they are actually
47:37 - created by a machine
47:39 - so it's very interesting business model
47:40 - yeah so we built they also project for
47:42 - them
47:42 - and then once you actually uh
47:46 - build a great project for someone and
47:48 - also for net like
47:49 - you shouldn't be very expensive in the
47:51 - beginning you should
47:52 - provide as much value as you can this is
47:54 - as you can this is the
47:55 - most important thing when landing your
47:57 - first clients
47:58 - i mean overall like always like the
48:01 - value is
48:01 - the most important that's what what
48:03 - might what do you have
48:05 - what mindset do you have when you go
48:08 - into for example to talk with the client
48:12 - um so they at this point they were all
48:14 - recommended right so
48:15 - we already knew that they want some kind
48:17 - of the project we proposed them the
48:19 - solution for that we say how we can do
48:20 - that and we agreed on some prices and
48:22 - those prices are
48:23 - really low uh because we just wanted to
48:25 - start
48:26 - so those are projects for like 2.5 or 3k
48:29 - uh euros i mean it's not like they are
48:32 - very low but if you run your business
48:35 - you have to pay
48:36 - taxes on your own and taxes in german is
48:38 - like half percent
48:39 - uh like 50 so in the end it's like very
48:42 - shitty like
48:43 - still if we are just doing uh nine to
48:45 - five as developers it's like
48:47 - most more like just profitable no stress
48:49 - nothing right but we just
48:51 - wanted to do that anyway so we built
48:53 - those things for those two guys
48:55 - and this is how it started because at
48:56 - this point like the guy was the ceo
48:59 - of this company and he has a lot of
49:00 - different network connections
49:02 - so he recommended us to other guys and
49:04 - this is how he kind of started there in
49:05 - germany
49:06 - also the second guy he also landed some
49:08 - clients he already had
49:10 - nice experience working with us so he
49:12 - gave us another product and meanwhile we
49:14 - are also searching for other people
49:16 - in other places so this is how we do it
49:19 - uh when you say searching what do you
49:21 - mean by searching
49:24 - like locally around you
49:27 - yes like with the same with the same uh
49:30 - model so we
49:31 - go on those communities we say that hey
49:33 - we are agency
49:35 - uh we looking for a project and so on we
49:37 - are happy to talk about some automation
49:39 - ideas and stuff like this
49:40 - uh even though at some point we uh
49:44 - we wanted to get into the niches so our
49:46 - first niche where we wanted to get in
49:48 - was the
49:49 - marketing niche because we already did
49:50 - like a lot of automations with like
49:52 - shopify
49:53 - amazon ad spent uh we aggregate
49:56 - aggregated the data we displayed in
49:58 - google sheets
49:59 - and we will and then i started literally
50:01 - talking to
50:02 - agency owners i asked them for literally
50:04 - an interview and asked them for their
50:05 - processes
50:06 - and they were getting me a data for free
50:08 - because it wasn't a sales call
50:10 - they just literally were talking okay we
50:12 - are using this software
50:13 - i think in this server this sucks i know
50:15 - literally noting this all down building
50:16 - my own
50:17 - database but at the same time we didn't
50:20 - really know if we want to do it so we
50:21 - are just kind of getting
50:23 - clients i would say randomly because of
50:26 - other connections
50:27 - they were just approaching us so we are
50:29 - really lucky at this point
50:30 - and i would do like a quick um
50:34 - like a time travel to the point where
50:36 - are we right now because
50:38 - literally right now at this point we are
50:40 - launching self pain self
50:41 - made 2.0 which is uh
50:44 - so i have a new co-founder the third guy
50:46 - who joined us and
50:48 - this is uh how we kind of start again
50:50 - but with the whole
50:52 - mindset which we developed over the last
50:54 - eight months so right now we are
50:55 - literally going over the one niche
50:57 - which is the automotive that's like a
51:00 - journey which we want to kind of start
51:01 - right now so it's still
51:02 - software it's still custom software as
51:05 - we do
51:06 - like right as we were doing over the
51:07 - last eight months but it's all around
51:09 - one niche
51:10 - now you're asking why it's yeah perfect
51:12 - question so
51:13 - over the last eight months we are just
51:14 - doing everything for everyone
51:16 - uh we said that we are the auto
51:19 - automation agency but in the end we also
51:21 - were building some kind of websites uh
51:24 - because we just hit the project we just
51:26 - had to take the project so we are
51:27 - learning a lot about different
51:29 - integrations
51:30 - different industries uh
51:33 - and this brought us to the moment where
51:35 - we are right now where we actually
51:37 - finally saved uh some money so
51:41 - the title which you have right
51:42 - six-figure agency is this
51:44 - is happened like literally like recently
51:48 - when we started doing this right the
51:50 - first two three months has been like 1k
51:52 - 2k 3k 4k right we are we were growing
51:55 - but over the last few months you're
51:58 - talking about like earnings like four
51:59 - keep a month two keep a month earnings
52:00 - right
52:01 - and i just make sure be very clear this
52:02 - but with you guys is
52:04 - this is okay like a lot of you guys
52:06 - think that you know
52:07 - on foreign fortunate a lot of a lot of
52:09 - developers when they go into freelancing
52:11 - like i'm gonna be a millionaire that's
52:13 - it
52:14 - i'm gonna have a lot of money i can
52:16 - travel wherever i want and this could be
52:18 - a great life
52:19 - right and unfortunately right that's not
52:21 - the case
52:22 - right because i myself have been a
52:24 - freelancer as well
52:25 - jacob here he started philanthropy of
52:27 - course as well and
52:29 - you guys can see that it is not the case
52:31 - right
52:32 - not very much the case at all because
52:35 - it's a lot of hours
52:36 - and you start out with shitty money
52:38 - potentially right yeah it's basically
52:40 - no matter how much experience you have
52:43 - right
52:44 - in terms of coding you might ask that
52:47 - with your business set up for the bottom
52:49 - because
52:50 - you have not built your reputation in
52:52 - the freelancer world initially at all
52:55 - right exactly it's a long marathon it's
52:58 - not a sprint
52:59 - exactly exactly and so now you say
53:01 - you're getting one take
53:03 - 1k 2k 3k and so just tell me now that
53:06 - when you guys were going into with focus
53:08 - on the automotive stuff
53:10 - which is when you focus on motor stuff
53:11 - give me some examples like what kind of
53:13 - projects you're building in the
53:14 - automotive industry
53:15 - exactly so we just picked this niche
53:18 - it's not like
53:19 - we are still in the research phase so in
53:21 - two three weeks when we talk to like 100
53:23 - people
53:23 - we might decide that we actually change
53:25 - change it to different one but the thing
53:27 - is
53:28 - again to the earnings right finally
53:32 - like we had this first month i think it
53:34 - was like january or february
53:36 - when we actually hit 10k that was the
53:39 - next month was 20k and it was like
53:41 -  it was it was crazy it was also
53:43 - accumulated because
53:45 - uh when you do agency when you are
53:47 - freelancer
53:48 - it's very hard to get your first
53:50 - projects people don't trust you and
53:52 - usually they don't even agree to pay
53:54 - upfront
53:55 - and they don't agree to pay hourly so we
53:58 - had this one project actually couple of
53:59 - projects that
54:00 - we are building this over four months
54:02 - and in the fourth month
54:04 - we just we just saw the money right so
54:06 - it will all the investment that we
54:07 - didn't even
54:08 - for that we'll see the money so this is
54:10 - how we also accumulated this
54:12 - but that's the best thing that i mean me
54:14 - and wojtek we were we are young and
54:16 - in order to survive for us like 2k for a
54:18 - person is enough
54:20 - um wow that's the the best size and
54:23 - that that's the best thing and now when
54:25 - we have like more
54:26 - money it changes my mindset because it's
54:29 - not like okay now i'm going to
54:31 - i don't know release a porsche right
54:32 - it's not the case
54:34 - i would never do that like i mean maybe
54:37 - somewhere in the future right but now i
54:41 - see
54:41 - the potential of it that wow i have the
54:43 - budget so
54:44 - i can literally focus on the niche do a
54:47 - research
54:48 - if i have the previous clients i can get
54:51 - a developer
54:52 - hire him he will be part of our team i
54:55 - will
54:56 - build a brand we'll actually pay for a
54:59 - marketing will pay for a content
55:01 - and do some run some ads like this is
55:03 - what a whole money will be from for
55:04 - investment in the company
55:06 - so we are finally in the moment that we
55:07 - can do it this is also why we're doing
55:09 - the whole rebranding the new logo which
55:10 - is actually on the
55:11 - thumbnail of it it's not released yet
55:13 - only on youtube
55:15 - uh the new totally new website this is
55:18 - how we will use that right so
55:20 - we just started uh those bigger numbers
55:22 - we are very excited
55:24 - um but yeah we're also very humble about
55:27 - that because it's been
55:28 - very tough eight months to be where are
55:31 - we
55:32 - and to be honest like we're just
55:34 - starting man like
55:35 - it's a long long game like um so
55:39 - yeah this is how it is it's a very long
55:42 - game right it's a
55:43 - it's an interesting game right um i've
55:46 - been this game as well of course
55:48 - um so and you guys started basically now
55:51 - doing this niche right the automotive
55:53 - niche right
55:54 - and you guys seen it you know you guys
55:56 - seen bigger numbers from previous
55:57 - projects of course now at this point
55:59 - now what are you going to do how are you
56:01 - going to reinvest the money back right
56:03 - a lot of money a lot of people they
56:05 - might might get the money they're
56:06 - invested that you might spend it
56:07 - somewhere
56:08 - what's the goal here when you go ahead
56:10 - and make money as a south agency what is
56:12 - the goal now with that money tell me
56:13 - i'm just kidding i'm a christmas tree
56:15 - because i can tell you where we spend it
56:16 - here at our company here
56:17 - yeah so i'm curious so normally whenever
56:21 - we have a project a client
56:23 - i just do everything by myself uh
56:26 - because i didn't even know how i could
56:28 - uh spend that i would want to save as
56:30 - much as i can
56:31 - but now having this mindset i can bring
56:33 - some new developer and just
56:35 - uh spend this money on him right so hire
56:38 - him
56:38 - reinvest the money even though if this
56:41 - can fail we
56:42 - we learn how to work with other people
56:43 - so it's a perfect
56:45 - learning opportunity same with ads same
56:47 - with whole marketing around that
56:50 - also i'll be able to finally not
56:53 - um just work on coding part which just
56:56 - brings money but do actually a research
56:58 - so no one will pay me for meetings like
57:00 - no one paid me for meetings before even
57:01 - with their clients right
57:02 - but now we are talking to potential
57:04 - clients we are talking to the business
57:06 - owners in automotive niche and those are
57:08 - just the meetings 30 minutes but it can
57:10 - be very very
57:11 - time consuming over like a next few few
57:14 - weeks
57:15 - so this is also like just a the safety
57:17 - net for the future for us
57:20 - to pay ourselves in the future because
57:22 - yeah
57:23 - i think that that's the difference
57:24 - between like a startup
57:26 - uh approach when you get the founding
57:28 - grounds and so on but just an
57:29 - agency uh model it's it's completely
57:32 - different
57:33 - how many how many people do you guys
57:35 - have working with you i know you
57:36 - told me on the contractor basis you guys
57:39 - have been working with how many people
57:40 - do you work with
57:40 - on a regular basis tell me yeah so right
57:43 - now we have three
57:44 - people working with plus uh two other
57:46 - founders so it's like we are a team of
57:48 - six
57:49 - but uh sometimes we have like some other
57:51 - people bring you on for like some kind
57:52 - of consultations whenever there's a
57:53 - project that we really
57:55 - uh need an expert but we kind of know
57:57 - how to build that and those experts are
57:59 - too
58:00 - uh expensive to build it we just hire
58:01 - them for consultations to
58:03 - ask uh about those things so this is
58:07 - my way that's a pretty smart so
58:08 - basically instead of hiring the person
58:10 - right the developer you hire them as a
58:12 - consultant and they keep building
58:13 - yourself so you basically get the
58:14 - knowledge from them
58:15 - but you're also not paying for the hours
58:18 - at the same time you just kind of build
58:19 - them
58:19 - by yourself basically yeah we would
58:21 - rather pay them like even 200
58:23 - uh dollars per hour right wow to
58:26 - validate our current solution which we
58:28 - work on a
58:29 - whole week rather than hire them for a
58:31 - full time because then it's like
58:32 - crazy and at this point we also can't
58:35 - charge
58:36 - clients that the crazy money um how much
58:39 - i miss this question i mean if you want
58:40 - to if you don't want to say that that's
58:41 - fine too
58:42 - how much do you how much do you on
58:43 - regular basis charge per hour for a
58:45 - client
58:46 - like it's still it's still uh it's
58:49 - we can't say uh the average because it
58:52 - really is different on the project
58:54 - uh like there's one client when we can
58:56 - charge him 30
58:57 - euros per hour then sometimes 50 but it
59:00 - all depends on the situation where are
59:01 - we at and again
59:03 - hourly pricing and fixed pricing is
59:04 - totally different game yeah
59:06 - um there is a lot of negotiating coming
59:08 - to this so it's it's very
59:10 - hard to tell how much we earn actually
59:12 - per hour because
59:14 - taking under consideration how much we
59:15 - work during a week
59:17 - it will be still i'm still we
59:20 - earn less that if we were working
59:22 - full-time as developers that i can tell
59:24 - you
59:24 - clearly because like when you work as a
59:26 - developer
59:27 - as in the company let's say eight hours
59:29 - a day then you really code for four
59:31 - hours then you have a couple of meetings
59:32 - especially right now
59:33 - remote work yeah that's my experience
59:36 - but when you work for someone else like
59:39 - he's your client then every hour really
59:41 - count because if you don't really focus
59:43 - on this hour then
59:44 - you're burning this time no one will pay
59:46 - you for that especially on the fixed
59:47 - price contract it's different approach
59:49 - so
59:50 - that's true that's true now also we
59:52 - failed so many times
59:54 - sorry i know i mean i've been there too
59:56 - honestly now do you do fixed price
59:57 - projects as well because
59:58 - when i was doing the adjustments what's
60:01 - up
60:02 - it's just fixed price it's very hard to
60:04 - even talk about oh it is just fixed
60:06 - price
60:07 - it's almost impossible to get to the
60:09 - point of hourly contracts
60:10 - like we usually wait two hours
60:14 - projects because all i hear from them is
60:16 - do not do fixed price projects
60:17 - of course but it's also almost
60:20 - impossible to
60:21 - to get hourly clients like talking to ex
60:24 - from my experience is just
60:26 - impossible so we usually have uh
60:27 - maintenance contracts for hourly
60:29 - but then we also talk about kind of like
60:31 - a fix so what does it take to fix this
60:33 - bug
60:34 - this is how it is right now maybe at
60:36 - some point we'll get to the point where
60:38 - blake is but for now it's just yeah we
60:39 - are still
60:40 - too early in this game right it's just
60:41 - eight months and now we are
60:43 - taking some serious moves regarding the
60:45 - niche um
60:47 - so that's how it is tell me what are
60:50 - some biggest things that you had to
60:52 - change within you when starting
60:54 - something like this like
60:55 - internally what did you have to change
60:57 - tell me
60:59 - um so yeah before when i was just doing
61:02 - jobs there was not really a huge
61:04 - responsibly
61:05 - responsibility on my side so whenever
61:07 - there was a feature
61:09 - for example in corporate world um i knew
61:12 - that if i don't do it for tomorrow like
61:14 - they can blame me or something but
61:15 - nothing really happens overall they have
61:17 -  tons of money and stuff like this
61:18 - i'm nothing in this
61:20 - corporate leather i knew that right and
61:23 - at some point i was
61:24 - getting very lazy because of that
61:26 - because it was like unfair advantage
61:28 - that
61:28 - i'm really good at people and if i
61:32 - really don't want to do something i
61:33 - won't do it but then i will
61:35 - like force myself to do it
61:38 - so even working in a company 20 hours
61:41 - per week i could easily do my task over
61:43 - like four to five
61:44 - hours and the whole team i was literally
61:46 - asking boss if
61:47 - it's all good they were like super proud
61:49 - and stuff like this right so
61:52 - i was literally getting bored and lazy
61:55 - at the same time which is really bad
61:57 - but here yeah as i told you already
61:59 - there's no way of
62:01 - kind of cheating there's no way because
62:03 - if you don't do
62:04 - stuff then you just don't get paid and
62:07 - yeah it's totally different
62:09 - i'm just more motivated to work than
62:11 - ever also like i love it so much that i
62:13 - always am into that like whenever i
62:15 - don't even work or code i always have
62:16 - some kind of
62:17 - business ideas that we want to develop
62:19 - so it's it's different yeah
62:21 - that's awesome so somebody asked
62:23 - somebody asked here but the rasheed
62:25 - asks what is the niche about right so
62:27 - the automotive niche right
62:29 - go a little bit deeper deeper into that
62:31 - what do you mean by that are you guys
62:32 - building you know dashboards for
62:34 - automotive
62:35 - companies what does that look like so
62:38 - yeah
62:38 - that's the thing that we uh we already
62:40 - have three projects now portfolio and
62:42 - automotive
62:42 - which are totally different so one is
62:45 - about
62:45 - uh scanning cars the vista scanning
62:49 - solutions uh company from us
62:51 - uh this is all about gathering data from
62:53 - different scans
62:54 - uh priests can post kind of um
62:56 - diagnostic scans and stuff like this
62:58 - uh so we are working there and helping
63:00 - them out a lot then
63:02 - that was like one part so it's more
63:04 - about literally a
63:06 - very specific knowledge in the industry
63:08 - of cars like all about the car parts
63:10 - um then the third one is actually uh for
63:13 - dana
63:14 - um they approached us with the scrapers
63:17 - so we had to build a very custom
63:19 - scrapers for them to cover like
63:21 - uh a competitor
63:24 - uh gaskets i'm not i can't say more
63:26 - about it because we have some contracts
63:28 - there and so on
63:28 - but this is what i might have today tell
63:31 - uh so that's the different uh
63:32 - thing so it's all about automation and
63:34 - the third guy uh that was our recent
63:36 - client we just finished the page is uh
63:39 - about he's at car dealership who's
63:41 - exporting cars from
63:42 - switzerland to poland and actually we
63:44 - built uh
63:45 - some kind of also a scrapers and
63:47 - automation tools for them
63:50 - for for them actually yeah and in the
63:52 - end they have a whole car platform when
63:54 - people from poland can bat
63:56 - cars um and they are like responsible
63:59 - just for delivering the cars and handle
64:01 - all of the
64:02 - um like payment and other stuff
64:04 - processes so it's also helping them a
64:06 - lot so those are three different
64:08 - projects but in the automotive niche so
64:10 - currently
64:11 - we are check we are asking other car
64:14 - dealerships
64:15 - if there's any way that we could maybe
64:17 - build for them or like who are they
64:19 - processing the a their company we are
64:22 - not talking the small guys more like to
64:23 - the bigger guys
64:24 - i know that there's a lot of different
64:26 - crm systems for just car dealerships
64:29 - and yeah we just in the research phase

65:29 - perfect so you guys can reach him out on
65:33 - that specific on that instagram
65:35 - i don't know why i wear myself the whole
65:36 - time because i actually think this is
65:38 - better right here
65:38 - i kind of like this when i hear better
65:40 - yeah so but anyways so
65:42 - that's really cool so that's your you're
65:44 - basically on a different automotive
65:45 - industry
65:46 - in and you're trying this nation this
65:48 - niche potentially might work out because
65:50 - you know one thing i realized that when
65:51 - i was starting to do it started
65:53 - a software agency is you get to you kind
65:55 - of have to build everything
65:57 - everything for everybody and it's not
65:59 - fun because you just diverted into
66:01 - so many different places you know
66:04 - this one part like i mean i remember
66:06 - when i was doing this i was doing
66:08 - seo i was doing you know you know
66:10 - wordpress
66:11 - i was doing literally you know jingle
66:13 - and then react js
66:14 - and like there's all these different
66:16 - projects that you have to do and
66:18 - it's just not i don't know it's just not
66:20 - fun when you do when you there's no
66:21 - niche right
66:22 - so like not focused if if there is like
66:24 - a serious big company they just want to
66:26 - work with the best and to get to the
66:27 - best you have to be the best like really
66:29 - so also like this is just start bing
66:33 - automotive agency let's say so right
66:35 - software agency for automotive
66:36 - it's not also uh deep
66:40 - enough in my opinion but this is a great
66:41 - start so the process like i mean this
66:44 - will take like next two three four years
66:46 - but i already have a next steps for it
66:49 - so
66:50 - first like that's the worst thing is
66:51 - that i myself in vojtec which we started
66:54 - like we are developers
66:55 - we have no idea about any industry
66:59 - problems and so on we just knew coding
67:02 - but at the end of the day coding is a
67:03 - tool
67:04 - so you don't really solve any business
67:06 - business cases you don't really provide
67:08 - the value that's
67:09 - why you are a developer which is totally
67:10 - perfect most of the people just want to
67:12 - be developers that's totally perfect
67:15 - um like you are basically also
67:19 - tool right you have managers above you
67:21 - which are just experts in the industry
67:23 - they know where the value comes from
67:24 - but when you start agency and you know
67:27 - nothing about the industry itself it's
67:28 - very tough so that's why
67:30 - we want to niche down do a lot of
67:32 - interviews talk to experts and then
67:34 - see how we can actually use this tool
67:36 - and help them
67:37 - and that would be the step first step so
67:40 - still
67:41 - custom coding for automotive uh
67:44 - industry and then let's say after three
67:46 - or four years when we really really
67:48 - build a lot of projects around that
67:50 - we may come to the we may come to the
67:52 - point where we have really nice team
67:54 - a really nice expert expert knowledge
67:58 - and we will change to the sas company
68:00 - because building the sas company
68:01 - is very very hard people don't earn
68:05 - money for like two three years some
68:06 - people like most of the people who are
68:08 - building sas software they have totally
68:10 - wrong approaches just going to investors
68:12 - uh getting the money and they they
68:14 - usually fail it's it's a very
68:16 - different topic but i have this health
68:19 - i would say mindset to it that we first
68:22 - tackled down a lot of different problems
68:24 - see where's actually see where is the
68:26 - potential to build the perfect sauce
68:29 - uh actually being being there already
68:31 - solve those problems and then maybe come
68:33 - up with something that we already
68:34 - uh have a clients also who are who want
68:37 - to pay for that because
68:38 - a lot of people build this sas pro like
68:40 - they build products
68:41 - then they go out and they ask for
68:43 - feedback no one's really want that right
68:44 - so they spend like eight months one year
68:47 - they do it soon they so don't see any
68:49 - money at all and they just quit because
68:51 - no one wants that
68:52 - so yeah i think this is the nice nice
68:55 - long-term vision for building a sas
68:57 - company where there's a goal because
68:59 - there's a scale for that right
69:00 - you don't have to come up with the whole
69:03 - code base
69:04 - you don't have to find clients all the
69:06 - time right it's kind of like this is
69:08 - you know do it once right it's sell sell
69:10 - it you know many times
69:11 - i think that's the bottle right for a
69:13 - sass business right um
69:14 - and i i haven't told you this but we're
69:16 - actually internally building
69:18 - something sas as well internally here
69:20 - we're building something that will help
69:22 - students a lot a lot of students that
69:23 - kind of learn
69:24 - right and work in a building internally
69:26 - to kind of use it internally within us
69:28 - and who knows they might might go out to
69:30 - multiple people at some points in the
69:31 - future
69:32 - and that's the thing because you already
69:33 - have a lot of experience in the industry
69:35 - that you know what people want right and
69:36 - you have
69:37 - a group of people that you can deliver
69:39 - this to them right
69:40 - and they will give you a feedback and
69:42 - then you can improve the software and
69:44 - maybe go abroad with it that's a perfect
69:46 - approach for this
69:48 - so tell me jake i want to ask you this
69:49 - one question okay
69:51 - what excites you my friend like what
69:52 - excites you about what you're doing
69:56 - what excites me what i'm doing i mean
69:58 - overall that we can
69:59 - really have impact in the world that we
70:02 - can really
70:03 - like help other people and solve their
70:05 - problems like i think by the end of the
70:06 - day
70:07 - seeing how our clients are happy is the
70:09 - best like it's
70:10 - it's just it's yeah it's totally what i
70:13 - really love so
70:14 - when i was just a developer with a team
70:15 - like of course like boss boss could say
70:17 - that yeah great job of course that was
70:19 - really nice but now when i really see
70:21 - that we
70:22 - can save or earn people earn
70:25 - money for our clients it's just the best
70:27 - thing in the world or also that
70:29 - we are building our internal team and
70:32 - the collaboration with us is great
70:34 - that we can pace uh and actually provide
70:38 - jobs to other people man it is crazy and
70:41 - also like building the brand
70:43 - uh i mean it was always my dream
70:45 - starting from personal brand now to more
70:47 - like a
70:48 - broad brand it's another factor which
70:51 - just
70:52 - drives me on daily basis i think the
70:54 - most
70:55 - so that's awesome what do you think what
70:58 - kind of mindset do you think need to
71:00 - have
71:00 - in order to be able to build something
71:02 - like this like what might
71:04 - you to have when you go into like a
71:06 - software you see or you go into
71:07 - freelancing
71:08 - what do you think um yeah so i mean
71:12 - from like my mindset i think that
71:16 - in the end i'm not scared of failing at
71:18 - all i actually
71:19 - love to learn from my own uh mistakes
71:22 - it's it's very hard to to build this
71:25 - because it
71:26 - it it's very painful most of the time
71:29 - like
71:30 - the consult with the negotiations
71:33 - which i had to gone through like it's
71:36 - been
71:37 - really stressful like i had those days
71:39 - where i literally couldn't
71:41 - code at all there was very a lot of
71:43 - stress coming because
71:44 - those snitches they needed to be done
71:46 - but at the same time i had
71:48 - to just handle the negotiation part
71:50 - meeting part
71:51 - so it takes a lot it's hard
71:54 - uh but i don't know by the end of the
71:57 - day i
71:58 - when i zoom out and i see a like a long
72:02 - picture like a big picture
72:04 - i'm happy of my results from back right
72:07 - so you see the chart
72:09 - day by day it looks like a sinus like
72:11 - literally and there's a fail there's a
72:12 - wind there's a
72:13 - there's a win but overall the trend is
72:15 - going like this right so it's going up
72:17 - like but you just really need to think
72:19 - long long term
72:20 - yeah this is actually what gave me the
72:23 - biggest mindset and i think that gary
72:24 - vaynerchuk
72:25 - like he uh taught me this a lot because
72:28 - i was like
72:29 - reading his books listing his podcast
72:32 - and watching his content
72:33 - so i think that he taught me that yeah
72:37 - yeah he's very much about you know long
72:38 - term he's very much about
72:40 - kind of doing you know things and just
72:42 - being persistent with them right
72:45 - you know and not just trying to get the
72:47 - most out of the current situation right
72:49 - um
72:50 - it's very much about you know what just
72:52 - work at it give it some time of course
72:54 - right and so forth learn from your
72:56 - mistakes and
72:58 - because the biggest thing that people
72:59 - have is they give up right like even i
73:02 - partially i want to say i partially gave
73:04 - up i mean i didn't give up
73:06 - like because i had this i mean i still
73:08 - have the software agency right
73:10 - um but i just don't take any clients
73:12 - right now at this point right
73:13 - and nor do i want to um but the reason
73:16 - why i did this because i decided to go
73:17 - someplace else but just try to do
73:19 - something
73:19 - more more of what i love right which is
73:21 - what i'm doing right now which is
73:23 - i get to teach all the students i get to
73:25 - build courses and so forth and i get to
73:27 - be part of an amazing team
73:28 - and of course and um yeah so
73:32 - i kind of did that right but a lot of a
73:34 - lot of people they'll get into this with
73:35 - a lot of high expectations
73:37 - thinking you don't need much work and
73:38 - then and then you know
73:40 - ninety percent is extremely it's
73:43 - extremely hard
73:45 - so if you are like i don't know a
73:47 - quitter
73:48 - you just don't do it at this point it's
73:50 - not worth it uh you just need to know
73:52 - that you'll
73:53 - fail badly feel like a most of the
73:56 - days but overall if you zoom out it'll
73:58 - be nice no it's it it
74:00 - was like that like a lot a lot i had a
74:02 - lot of tough
74:03 - uh also conversation with my founder
74:06 - like we had a lot of different
74:08 - kind of views on the company we still
74:10 - have and overall it's
74:11 - all hard but yeah it excites me at the
74:14 - same time so
74:15 - that's why i'm doing it and also i think
74:17 - that will be a different opinion than
74:19 - blake had because i also
74:20 - heard the previous podcast with him like
74:23 - i know that
74:24 - when he started agency that he already
74:26 - was working somewhere and
74:28 - he could actually do both at the same
74:30 - time for me it wasn't the case
74:31 - if i do something i do it all in so
74:35 - i really need to save some money for
74:37 - those two three months
74:38 - and then quit everything and then the
74:40 - worst scenario is like i fail miserably
74:43 - i can always go back get another job so
74:46 - for me that was the case that i really
74:48 - had to decide
74:50 - be under the pressure and like literally
74:52 - have the survival mindset that
74:54 - if i won't do anything for next to three
74:56 - months i literally
74:57 - won't survive i don't need to move to
74:59 - parents or something so yeah
75:01 - that was my approach to this and i know
75:03 - that there are a lot of people who need
75:05 - to do the same
75:07 - yeah that's interesting but it's not the
75:08 - only way you can also keep your job and
75:10 - start your own
75:11 - yeah there's multiple ways to go about
75:13 - it
75:14 - um tell me this i'm very curious what is
75:17 - the hardest project that you
75:19 - had to do like what is the hardest
75:21 - project where maybe you lost money
75:23 - because you had to hire someone or
75:25 - you know it was a toughest project that
75:26 - you had to go through
75:28 - you know i've had my sheriff projects
75:30 - where literally
75:31 - it was a fixed price project so i
75:33 - thought it would take this amount of
75:34 - time it took a lot more
75:36 - i'm like holy next time no you know
75:38 - i'm losing money
75:39 - like what are some of the toughest parts
75:40 - that you that you that you did
75:43 - yeah so we had a free body experiences
75:45 - hiring
75:46 - people um it wasn't really about losing
75:49 - a lot of money
75:49 - fortunately we are lucky enough to do
75:51 - that but we also don't operate on those
75:53 - like
75:53 - super crazy prices yet right yeah like
75:55 - our biggest
75:56 - project but also over a few months has
75:59 - been like maybe 27k
76:01 - so if more projects but there are lower
76:03 - prices so there's nothing to lose that
76:05 - much and that's why
76:06 - also it's like let's say safe because me
76:09 - and my co-founder we have really good
76:10 - coders so we can always
76:11 - go and code it for ourselves but we had
76:13 - those situation that i hired someone
76:16 - and then i was asking for a fee for
76:17 - feedback and stuff like this i was
76:19 - checking and then after
76:20 - one week i was like hey we need to have
76:22 - it on monday it was like literally
76:23 - sunday morning and then the guy showed
76:26 - me that he literally has nothing i was
76:27 - like
76:28 - wow we had nothing and we had to do that
76:30 - so i literally like worked
76:32 - 24 hours straight and just build the mvp
76:35 - for the guy
76:36 - and showed up and i saved the project
76:38 - and the whole um
76:39 - relation with the client right wow so i
76:42 - had to do those sacrifices then
76:44 - actually it's the upwork thing it's also
76:46 - funny it wasn't about hiring but i hired
76:49 - a friend
76:50 - for design part because like there was a
76:52 - two-step process that we had to first
76:54 - give them designs and then code it
76:57 - so i hired the guy and then
77:00 - uh it was actually um a project with
77:03 - some people from korea i think
77:05 - and then uh they give me like kind of a
77:07 - paper
77:08 - visualization of the project of some
77:10 - dashboard and they said okay do it in a
77:11 - figma in a modern way
77:12 - so my friend is really good he's
77:15 - extremely good in figma
77:16 - he designed it in a really nice modern
77:18 - way and then um
77:20 - they had to have it ready on like
77:22 - tuesday hour morning in germany
77:24 - and i was like sending everything to
77:26 - them monday evening and then
77:27 - their ceo which i never saw again in my
77:30 - life they
77:31 - she called me and she said that this is
77:32 - completely wrong that it
77:34 - cannot be like that so i would say they
77:36 - kind of scammed me
77:38 - uh because she literally sent me a
77:40 - totally new different visions with
77:42 - different
77:43 - things and they say it needs to be ready
77:44 - for tomorrow i'm like what the i
77:47 - i just did what the guy asked me to do
77:49 - in the beginning
77:50 - here's the results and i was like okay i
77:52 - can't do that like let's
77:54 - like close this contract i won't give
77:57 - you any stars and i won't charge you for
77:59 - anything
78:00 - on upwork but please don't give me any
78:02 - bad opinion but unfortunately
78:03 - they didn't give me any bad opinion but
78:05 - unfortunately during upwork
78:06 - you have the success uh job rate right
78:09 - so
78:10 - basically it went down to like 80 or
78:13 - something so
78:14 - we weren't any more hundred percent and
78:16 - it up on upwork also that was the
78:18 - reason why we quit there because i was
78:19 - really pissed with this
78:20 - situation and in the end i had to pay my
78:23 - friend
78:23 - uh who is a designer just for my pocket
78:25 - money
78:26 - uh for that because of course he did
78:29 - what he wanted that he needed to
78:31 - do yeah that was like you think
78:34 - it's it's yeah again it's very hard and
78:36 - tough and most of the time so
78:38 - those are the situation and now the
78:40 - hardest part i think it was like this
78:42 - scraping project for uh dana that
78:45 - we delivered like it was extremely hard
78:47 - to build those scrapers that weren't the
78:49 - scrapers you see normally in the
78:51 - tutorials in the
78:52 - on youtube um they were all dynamic
78:55 - scrapers you to just handle the
78:56 - javascript
78:57 - and there was like literally millions of
78:59 - data uh
79:01 - so we built those scrapers but they were
79:03 - like very old pages and sometimes the
79:04 - javascript didn't really work
79:06 - and we had to literally go a few times
79:09 - over the whole
79:10 - like iterate over this page a few times
79:12 - we had like 40 different machines
79:14 - running on those
79:14 - pages in order to do it about it
79:18 - yeah on the gcp but even then it took
79:20 - like
79:21 - like i don't know 30 hours to even
79:23 - script whole thing
79:24 - and then i sent them the data and then
79:26 - sent they sent me data from like
79:28 - four years before and then it was less
79:30 - data right now it's like what the heck
79:32 - i'm like
79:33 -  then i run it again run it again
79:35 - and i had to create another custom
79:36 - script we just combined the data and to
79:38 - delete duplicates and we are good
79:40 - but man it was very stressful also
79:42 - because i i also didn't sleep for like
79:44 - 24 hours just like rating with the guy
79:46 - checking on those computers if they are
79:47 - still running
79:49 - so yeah but it's been fun it's been fun
79:52 - we learned a lot tough times
79:55 - tough times holy that's insane so
79:58 - i mean you guys can see right like you
80:00 - know the reason why you ask this
80:02 - question a lot of times is again
80:03 - they showcase the reality of situations
80:05 - right like this can be hard like
80:07 - i've been in situations where
80:09 - i had this client who wanted this uh
80:12 - project
80:12 - and you know literally you know fixed
80:16 - our
80:16 - fixed price project and i told him hey
80:18 - it's gonna cost you seven thousand
80:19 - dollars right
80:20 - you know for like 60 hours or something
80:22 - but you know as we're doing it he wanted
80:24 - more and more and more
80:25 - and next to you know the project is like
80:28 - 300
80:31 - that's the hours that's the case which
80:32 - happens to us yeah yeah 300 hours in and
80:35 - you
80:35 - and you cannot charge the client more i
80:38 - could not charge the client more right
80:40 - because i was willing to pretty much do
80:41 - anything to just to get a good review
80:43 - from the client
80:45 - exactly i still had to pay people
80:48 - exactly like dave the clients usually
80:51 - thinks that those things are
80:52 - included in the project but you never
80:55 - talk about
80:56 - before right so we also wanted to finish
80:58 - the project like we thought we
81:00 - literally before we end up finally
81:02 - getting paid for a project we finished
81:04 - it
81:04 - i think like eight times with more and
81:06 - more features which
81:08 - client thought they were in right so
81:10 - there were also situations like that
81:13 - but that's why you are also not putting
81:15 - all of the uh x in one bucket i would
81:17 - say when it comes to clients that's why
81:18 - we overall
81:19 - work for i think 14 different clients um
81:24 - and that's why we went and we are where
81:26 - we are right now that's awesome that's
81:28 - awesome
81:29 - so tell me how does your next five years
81:31 - look like where do you see yourself kind
81:33 - of go in the next five years tell me
81:34 - jacob
81:35 - i think five maybe it's a little bit too
81:38 - much uh definitely
81:40 - i don't want let's say in the next one
81:42 - year yeah definitely
81:43 - one year uh definitely we want to focus
81:46 - down on the one niche i don't know if it
81:47 - will be automotive finish i hope it will
81:49 - be
81:50 - with our approach right now uh i will
81:53 - not definitely double down right now on
81:55 - the whole marketing
81:56 - side and literally create like a b2b
81:58 - marketing part
81:59 - uh go back to youtube videos because in
82:01 - the by the end of the day
82:03 - actually youtube is crazy when it comes
82:05 - to getting clients like i created this
82:07 - one video for
82:08 - amazon mws which was kind of my first
82:10 - project on upwork
82:11 - i gave this solution on a youtube video
82:14 - there's no videos on the whole amazon
82:16 - nws
82:17 - i got literally like 30 or 40 potential
82:19 - emails
82:20 - for clients so i know it works and i
82:23 - have already this
82:24 - nice idea how i can approach the
82:27 - automotive niche i already have a kind
82:28 - of like i think
82:29 - 30 scrapers in 30 days for different
82:31 - marketplaces so
82:33 - man i have a lot of um ideas for it so
82:36 - that's
82:36 - definitely i think we want to grow a
82:39 - team uh
82:40 - that's definitely and at some point i
82:42 - want to
82:43 - uh i i would say not really focus on
82:45 - coding that much
82:46 - so in the whole self-made um
82:50 - let's say life's a life span there were
82:52 - some moments when in the beginning i was
82:54 - doing a lot of marketing so
82:55 - trying to get a lot of leads and i was
82:57 - coding and then at some point i was just
82:59 - jealous of my co-founder that he always
83:00 - calls he gets a really nice coding
83:02 - experience like man i want to code a lot
83:04 - right now
83:05 - and over five last months i was just
83:08 - coding like 10 day
83:09 - 10 hours a day i would say on average
83:12 - man i
83:12 - can't look at this anymore i mean i
83:15 - have this sometimes really
83:16 - i want to get back to growing actually
83:19 - um
83:20 - a company doing a marketing getting on a
83:22 - client's calls
83:23 - uh meetings uh growing the team but also
83:26 - at the same time also
83:28 - like coding because i just love it right
83:30 - but it was at those
83:31 - stages so yeah yeah that's for sure
83:35 - i think it's so funny because i when i
83:37 - was when you were working with us
83:39 - i remember from you as well you're like
83:40 - man i just can't wait to code again i
83:42 - miss cutting so much you know
83:44 - all the time i hear from you just i miss
83:46 - cody i want to code
83:47 - you know and then here you tell me like
83:49 - i couldn't like i've heard it for five
83:50 - months i'm like i'm done with
83:51 - this
83:53 - yeah yeah yeah it's like something
83:55 - that's not a thing that
83:57 - i think that's why i think i might be a
83:58 - good fit to this that i could be let's
84:00 - say a ceo because i know a little a lot
84:02 - about coding so i know how to talk about
84:04 - the
84:04 - technique technical part but i also am
84:07 - very interested in the business side so
84:10 - that's why i really like this part
84:12 - that's awesome some somebody here asked
84:14 - a really good question
84:15 - amg asked what mindset are you looking
84:17 - for when hiring so like when you when
84:18 - you hire
84:19 - developers on upwork or whatever else
84:20 - might be do you look for specifically
84:22 - something or no
84:23 - tell me um so yeah with hiring you are
84:27 - very
84:28 - um career like i would say it's a very
84:30 - slow
84:31 - process for us uh and because we failed
84:34 - so many times right now we are
84:36 - mostly hiring my recommendations and
84:39 - that's
84:39 - part one and also when it comes to
84:42 - mindset
84:43 - i really want those guys to be part of
84:46 - our team
84:47 - so even though right now we can't afford
84:48 - like a full-time yet
84:50 - developers right we want to um
84:53 - hire them for those contracts that that
84:56 - one day
84:57 - they will work with us full-time so
85:00 - that's mostly the mindset that they want
85:02 - to work with the industry
85:03 - they're willing to learn new things uh
85:05 - because at some point
85:07 - i would love uh to build a lot of uh
85:10 - content around the
85:11 - company agency like podcasts videos and
85:13 - stuff like this so
85:15 - if they will also be interested in this
85:16 - thing that would be perfect i don't want
85:17 - to force anyone to do it that's
85:19 - perfectly fine right
85:20 - but if they are also willing to do those
85:21 - things man that's like a
85:24 - dream so wait wait wait wait you're
85:26 - saying you want to build up do a podcast
85:28 - or build a podcast what are you talking
85:29 - about you know like overall when it
85:30 - comes to like marketing part of our
85:32 - company
85:33 - i would love to like create a podcast
85:35 - more youtube content
85:36 - instagram content and so on so if our
85:39 - employees
85:40 - if they would love to show up on those
85:41 - things that i would be the happiest guy
85:43 - in the world so
85:44 - yeah i mean they would really believe in
85:46 - their brand
85:47 - right so they are really part of the
85:49 - brand of this family
85:50 - i would love that brand is so powerful
85:54 - brand is literally everything honestly
85:55 - like jacob like that's the one thing we
85:57 - realized here at a clever program right
85:59 - is
86:00 - like even for example we have a boot
86:02 - camp that we started here at clever
86:03 - program right it's a boot camp that you
86:05 - know that takes people you know towards
86:07 - becoming developers in early six months
86:09 - and because they've had so much brand
86:12 - over all these years
86:13 - we've been able to be been able to start
86:15 - this up really really fast and actually
86:16 - have a lot of demand for from other
86:18 - students right
86:19 - because of that um and we kind of just
86:21 - realized i'm holy because every
86:23 - time i get a call with a person who's
86:24 - who does want to join the boot camp
86:26 - they're like oh i saw this video or
86:28 - i saw you guys here i saw you guys in
86:30 - this video or in this video on this
86:31 - video right
86:32 - or saw you guys on instagram or even a
86:34 - tick tock right and like oh this is so
86:36 - cool
86:37 - like it's crazy how much how much brand
86:40 - has so much
86:41 - pop not power but like there's so much
86:43 - value right
86:44 - you know it's like what kind of like
86:46 - what um garyvee
86:48 - gary always says you know jab jab jab
86:51 - right hook right
86:52 - so jab jab jab give val give out give
86:54 - back and ask
86:55 - right very quickly right very and then
86:57 - not very quickly but then ask after that
86:59 - right and realize that that's such a
87:02 - like keeping that in check is so
87:04 - important keep it then in check and not
87:06 - always
87:07 - asking is such an important ask it's not
87:09 - such an important aspect
87:11 - and instead just always kind of trying
87:12 - to give value put yourself
87:14 - out there right because what you're
87:16 - creating is you create a family like
87:18 - that
87:18 - believes in you you know what i mean
87:21 - that believes in you
87:22 - exactly that's also there's a
87:25 - concept of like let's say um salary
87:29 - uh personally i would feel bad if i have
87:31 - just fixed salary especially in those
87:33 - early stages so
87:34 - whoever joins join us right now like he
87:37 - has
87:38 - a huge impact what are we in the future
87:41 - and i wouldn't just stop on like this
87:43 - fixed salary
87:44 - i would literally go to the bonuses and
87:46 - so on because like
87:47 - if the guy trusts us right now believes
87:49 - in us and he's a part of the team right
87:51 - now then
87:52 - if we grow into like multi-million
87:53 - dollar company right
87:55 - like i would have no problem to sharing
87:57 - devs with those people
87:58 - because they were there first they
88:00 - believed in us so i would feel really
88:02 - bad
88:02 - just paying fixed um yeah do you want to
88:05 - get to the multi-million dollar agency
88:08 - i think it's i mean we'll be there at
88:11 - some point
88:12 - i just don't know when uh but this will
88:15 - happen
88:16 - i mean if we keep up what we do that's
88:18 - what i believe
88:19 - uh the long term game and that's why i
88:22 - don't want to quit at all
88:23 - it's that if you really do it like
88:25 - especially okay right now in the
88:27 - automotive industry what we see is like
88:28 - there's a huge barrier it's extremely
88:31 - hard to get in
88:32 - like there are those people who are
88:33 - building this software there are those
88:34 - companies who are getting this offer
88:35 - from them
88:36 - so it's literally those are close man
88:38 - but if they will be open just a little
88:40 - we get in man and we are there um
88:43 - that's what i believe so at some point
88:45 - of course uh
88:46 - i think i mean i know we will get there
88:49 - it will be very tough it will be very
88:50 - hard yeah
88:51 - harder than ever but i'm excited for it
88:54 - because
88:54 - also why i'm in this is that this is
88:57 - like you cannot predict what will happen
88:59 - even you won't there are some patterns
89:01 - you don't know who you will meet
89:04 - um that's why i'm also excited so you
89:06 - never know and i just and i kind of
89:07 - remember you remember you kind of when
89:09 - you first kind of left
89:10 - uh clever programmer right and you want
89:12 - to start your short separate agency like
89:14 - you were such a more of a beginner on
89:17 - the aspect of like a software agency
89:18 - right or like a business type aspect
89:20 - right
89:21 - and now like a few months later like
89:23 - you're you're this grown-up guy
89:25 - i'm not saying i mean you you were grown
89:27 - up before as well right but
89:29 - like more growing up in the knowledge
89:31 - base and
89:32 - and in your focus probably in terms of
89:34 - what you want to do a 22 year old right
89:36 - it's still pretty crazy
89:38 - you want to build your own software
89:39 - agency you got clients at 22 years old
89:41 - i don't know what i was doing 22 year
89:43 - olds but i was not building software
89:44 - ages that's for sure
89:47 - you know granted i was still working
89:49 - hard of course right that was still me
89:50 - always
89:52 - always but i wasn't doing that so
89:55 - from my point of view you know you're
89:56 - doing you're doing an amazing job and
89:59 - you know i'm really excited for where
90:00 - you're gonna go kind of the next few
90:01 - years
90:02 - you know i'm really excited appreciate
90:04 - it we
90:05 - this other pot this podcast in the next
90:08 - year or so again
90:10 - and we're going to call it man i'm
90:12 - housing for it
90:14 - it's going to be a million dollars now
90:16 - at that point
90:17 - seven figures one figure mode but man
90:19 - what's funny is like when you do
90:21 - this uh when you let's say go back and
90:25 - you look
90:25 - at yourself for example one a year ago
90:28 - two years ago and man
90:29 - every time i do this i i'm like what a
90:32 - jerk
90:33 - like who the i thought i am man so
90:36 - literally
90:36 - future myself are you watching this i'm
90:39 - sorry
90:42 - but man i'm excited so yeah i mean look
90:45 - you know it's the best part when you get
90:46 - to grow like even for example for me
90:48 - you know i get to look at myself you
90:50 - know when i've done i
90:52 - i watched recently the the the first
90:55 - video i did for clever programmer right
90:57 - i was like this innocent guy i was like
90:58 - hey guys you know how are you guys doing
91:00 - hope homeball is great
91:02 - you know you know and i just like i'm
91:04 - like i'm looking myself i'm like holy
91:06 -  who is this guy
91:07 - you know and i remember the first time
91:09 - that they kazzy and
91:11 - the team they took me out to what's it
91:13 - called to um
91:15 - santa monica here and they put me on the
91:17 - spot and just said hey
91:18 - we'll film you it's called the the video
91:20 - is called seven years and seven minutes
91:22 - and i remember that was so yeah i saw it
91:25 - i was so scared i was my pants
91:27 - like you know i was so scared to be
91:30 - talking in front of so many people but
91:31 - now
91:32 - i get to do this every day now if i go
91:34 - to santa monica and i have to shoot a
91:35 - video it's like a piece of cake i'm like
91:37 - let's roll you know i'm gonna tell you
91:39 - even the video you
91:40 - recorded the seven years in seven
91:42 - minutes i watched that and at this point
91:44 - i was
91:44 - literally watching it and back in poland
91:46 - because i discovered a clever programmer
91:48 - like literally like i know three years
91:50 - ago i was watching kazzyman then i saw
91:52 - you as like
91:52 - man those those guys are so cool they
91:55 - know so much i wanna work with them one
91:57 - day
91:58 - and then i grew the instagram at some
92:00 - point i texted qazi man it just happened
92:02 - right it just happened you think about
92:03 - it every single day
92:04 - and you really want it but i believe
92:06 - that it will happen
92:07 - but you really need to work on that you
92:10 - just need to work on it you
92:12 - just need to work on it those of you who
92:13 - think you know i tell
92:15 - i tell this to a lot of students because
92:16 - i get to speak to a lot of students now
92:18 - at this point right
92:19 - it's very simple is that there's two
92:21 - types of people in this world there's
92:22 - the types of people who talk about what
92:23 - they want to be
92:24 - they talk about the goals i want to do
92:26 - this i want to do this i want to do that
92:29 - but they do nothing about it because you
92:32 - know how the human brain works it's like
92:34 - whenever you talk about something
92:35 - your brain feels like you're like you
92:37 - already feel good your brain kind of
92:39 - feels like you already
92:40 - accomplished that so you don't do
92:41 - anything about that so i really usually
92:43 - i don't even talk about stuff that's why
92:44 - i'm not also like on
92:45 - instagram anymore because it's like i
92:47 - really focus on the work right now
92:49 - we really focus on taking the action not
92:52 - really sharing about that
92:53 - that it's totally different when i was
92:55 - sharing a lot of stuff on instagram
92:57 - at some point i was literally automating
92:58 - this that i was resharing the same post
93:00 - i just felt good
93:01 - i felt productive but it was like all
93:03 - fake productivity it was
93:05 - it wasn't bringing any results in the
93:07 - end so also be careful
93:09 - when talking but also i hate myself when
93:11 - i talk about something
93:13 - and i won't do it that's another thing
93:14 - right i talk about something then people
93:16 - are telling me about
93:17 - something like what i said and i just
93:19 - need to do it so
93:20 - it can works in different ways depends
93:23 - on your personality again
93:25 - it's so funny for the for day he's like
93:27 - how do i join the team like domain is
93:28 - mechanic and software dev
93:30 - what's too much to enjoy trying to join
93:32 - the self-made team we're trying to join
93:33 - the clever programmer team
93:39 - but yeah for those of you guys who do
93:41 - who are interested for example
93:42 - and you know getting your career started
93:44 - as a software developer just want to let
93:46 - you know guys
93:47 - down in the comments below we have just
93:49 - text hashtag coaching to the number you
93:51 - see below in the description on

93:55 - know we're doing
93:56 - you know uh free coaching to students
93:58 - who are interested right

94:02 - minute coaching session just to figure
94:03 - out you know
94:04 - you know what you want to do and so
94:05 - forth for days as the agency
94:07 - if you want to join the agency you talk
94:08 - to jacob
94:10 - [Laughter]
94:12 - exactly now i can only i can only agree
94:14 - like being a part of a clever programmer
94:16 - team also changed my game
94:18 - like i learned how to talk to people
94:20 - those coaching calls with like 40
94:22 - 50 students man it's been crazy it's
94:26 - been crazy like i'm not scared of
94:27 - talking to people at all after that

Cleaned transcript:

what is up everybody this is nas and i am here with my friend wait this way jacob and jacob who's jacob who are you jacob hey guys jacob here um i'm running my own um software agency together with two other founders it's been crazy last eight almost nine months and i'm not gonna lie i have a lot to share with you i've been also working with nas before in a clever programmer team this is how we know each other i've been a coach uh teaching python also i've been working uh three different companies before so yeah yeah it's been quite experience so he is a very experienced guy so jacob guy just so you know okay okay he's kind of chased himself but jacob right he is currently 22 years old he started coding when did you start coding jacob like four or five years old uh like the first line of code i was yeah so yeah really no no no five years old in high school it was like five years yeah yeah five years ago started coding basically you did not you did you go to college or no yeah yeah yeah i've been first going to college in poland and i dropped out and i was working fulltime uh job as a programmer and now currently i'm also student however i'm focusing most on my company so it's just yeah so so he guys he started off kind of basically like i said he did go to college he then he got us a job at a startup company right after that he actually worked with us as well over here with cleverprogrammer he was part of a lot of you know he was teaching students he was a big part of profit with python right after that he decided to kind of start out his own agency at the age of 22 right and he's been killing it kind of since then right he is of course it has not been easy for him at all we all know that right he's like holy it's hard right we'll talk about kind of his struggles today what got him into it and what made him now is six figure software agency owner right he has his own statistic but the name of self made which i think is really cool and now he just kind of he has a few people that work with him he has well you have three you have two other cofounders correct with you at this point exactly exactly then we have a designer and two programmers but me and my other cofounder we also like both fulltime coders i would say even more than fulltime uh this is how it is when you start your own agency it's not really you quit nine to five to do nine to nine or even more from 99 to nine to ten somebody's like hey have you ever dealt with failure oh i'm sure he's dealt with failure especially as he's going to something like this so guys but biscuit today we'll talk about his his you know his process what got him into it right and how he just kind of became the developer that he is today and of course if you have any questions whatsoever let me know of course let us know in the comments and we'll make sure to ask jacob here with those questions okay so if you have anything that's interesting just for go ahead and you know answer that awesome guys so that's pretty much it so jacob now tell me a little about this okay tell me kind of one is what got you into coding how you got started into coding and so forth okay all right yeah so it's early beginnings right i mean my whole life i've been into computers uh right and i started as a really professional gamer at some point i was considering a career as a gamer in the league of legends then contest strike but at some point it got me thinking that it may not be this thing right you were a gamer as well yeah i was like man i've been grinding games like when there was first season second season in league of legends i've been diamond and the diamond was the highest division so i've been killing it back in the days uh every day like 10 hours so on yeah that was like how i started then at some point i wanted to start to build my own games and man it's been so funny because then i went to a shop and i don't know it was a time when there was like a lot of those nice books and stuff like this uh those small shops so i got my hand on the first book and it was about building games and then i was like wow it's about building games using what uh it is i mean they introduced to some kind of a game builder so it was a lot of like blocks to put in so this is how i started building the it's it was i think rpg maker so you could literally build like a tbr game it's like a very old game um and yeah and then at some point there was like some kind of custom logic and it was all code and i was like wow what is it so you have to code stuff sort of like my first approach why did i have to learn here yeah exactly then that was like my first uh let's say touch and coding then and when i was around 11 or 12 i get myself into html a little bit and php but it was like literally nothing like a little bit of css so i started to know what it takes to build a website right but like to be honest the first time i really started to code like was in my last uh last year in high school because then i had we had a final test to get to university and uh we could choose between math physics uh also i t so i selected math and i t and this is how i started coding because i had to learn that and it's been it's been very fun but it was all just c and c plus plus so i was kind of also scared it wasn't i wasn't really motivated because it was just about pointers and allocating memory and man it it's been tough that is not fun at all not at all so then we went to like i went to uh college first year and we had this uh subject called python and not a lot of people were uh really into that but men jumping from a c to python when so many figures really nicely and nicely obstructed that you don't have to deal with allocating memory and pointers error i mean not really like there are also pointers in python but it's another story man it's been such a nice uh game changer for me because then i just i started to doing uh a lot about python just by myself right so i i checked like udemy courses and so on so and i was building my first software just for myself so i know other people were partying were doing some other stuff and i was just sitting in my room working and just coding i mean i was also a party guy of course oh this guy's a party guy too i know that are you kidding me but of course i mean in life you need need to have balance right like that's what i preach so of course when i go party i go party hard but it's usually after i do a really good accomplishment in my work so right just keeping the balance is very important but this is how i got into coding yeah so jacob so basically again so you went from c plus plus or from c up uh is that correct and your goal was that you kind of got into it because you know you were introduced to it through gaming right so you wanted to put the game and you started to you bought a book right and so forth and there was a lot of coding like holy what is this right at which point did you realize that okay this is interesting like this is something that i might want to do i mean to be honest uh like when i first touched those books with coding games uh i wasn't really interested then because i didn't understand really english and anything so it was very tough for me uh then then the same with html i didn't really know what i can do with it so i kind of put it away for a couple of years and then at high school when the whole coding fig got to me again then like also talking about i.t was very hot topic so i just got into it because at the end of the day i had to decide what will be my career path so at some point i wanted to be a doctor because i got really excited about biology but on the other hand i was always scared of blood so i was like no way i won't deal with that right but also i loved math and i think that i mean definitely c plus plus was always um like when i thought about c plus plus and there's case like and the algorithms which i learned and also like the tasks i solved they were really mathematical and especially in the beginning so this is how i got interested into that i was like okay let's try this more let's see what you can do and you can build with that and yeah again like the first university not really university itself but just the fact that i went to through a different like online courses this gave me actually a whole uh motivation to learn it really that's interesting wait so the online so the online courses which give you the motivation to to go for for what what line course did you take i'm curious was literally like some udemy free courses or some random youtube ones from python also like at some point i built a game in c plus plus uh that was a funny to go back into that because it was like university pro project and that was all about that right but the thing is that they didn't really teach this python university it was like literally like just trying it right but i was really at some like after my first year in university i was really motivated to actually get into the more and get my first job so man like usually no one gets internship after the first year of university but in my case i just i just wanted i just wanted it i i literally wanted it tell me why why did you want to because the thing is a lot of a lot of you know a lot of people what they might want to do is when they start out right they're like okay well i want to go to college i'm going to have some fun right i'm going gonna party it up you know maybe i'll learn a few things and so forth what kind of pushed you to know what to be like well you know what i kind of want to learn something i actually want to get a job in a way what was pushing to get a job were your parents pushing to get a job what was it not at all not my parents it's it's been more most also from my like kind of a goal in the life which was like okay so i'm from like i was born in germany but only i was born there and then i lived my whole life in poland i don't even speak german uh but at some point i always german yeah i mean a little bit a little bit but like literally you live in germany but you don't speak german yeah that's that's actually funny that's another story you don't have to do especially in the in it you should not be allowed to be there yeah yeah i mean i i can i can order a good dinner in german so that's what i need needed for but no like to be honest like at some point uh like i lived my whole life in poland and i will i've been abroad couple of times and it was always very exciting for me how people from all around the world they meet and they just talk in english uh and talk about their uh countries and so on like i've been always hyped for that and the year before starting my university i went for kind of like a a one month uh i don't know how to sell like a summer camp um to learn german and english and man it's been the best time in my life like i'm not gonna swear and i was so motivated that i said to myself okay i need to get internship but it cannot be internship in poland i wanna go abroad so at this point i mean i i was talking english like i was speaking english but it was quite bad but i was so motivated to do it that i applied for like 50 different companies in the germany man i failed to all of them literally i went through interviews i couldn't answer any questions like because my knowledge you apply yeah so you apply to all these companies somebody's saying couldn't talk that's funny good in the comments it's hilarious so i actually use it sometimes i just say good and tag you know but anyway so um you apply to all these different companies right without having any well i mean you had a little bit of knowledge to code it but not much at all yeah yeah exactly and it doesn't it didn't really matter for me which kind of a language was there like man i literally applied for all of the internships and i lied in my cv because at this point i only knew python i had nothing to tell about in my cv my cv looked like like i'm not gonna lie it was like black and white with my picture and i said okay i know python and i went through different courses on udemy and i'm motivated to do everything man that was my cv right so we mentioned this so come with us tell me this okay what did you lie about on what did you lie about on the what's it called on uh on you on your resume so it wasn't really lying in the resume but it was like okay i know how to code in python c plus plus java and javascript right but to be honest i only knew a little bit about python like i mean the c which i learned in the high school right it was just for solving algorithms it wasn't to build any products so i hope that i will learn i'll push myself through through it because when i'm working on the pressure i work better so yeah when i was actually the case by the way just so you guys know yeah i need to work i need to work under pressure yeah under pressure when you work under pressure you know that's why all we always say you know what you know build the project and so and so forth right the projects and what you're doing in in school whatever i might be doing that's just kind of getting you ready for the real thing right that's kind of because the end goal is always going to be to get a job that actually puts under pressure because why when you're in that job that's when you actually learn the most right when you're around people right that's when you learn the most so actually that's that's kind of the best part about that right so um yeah it's something that i think is very important to say to to those to those who are listening because a lot of you guys are thinking well you know you know how do i go ahead and get that first job and so forth right and what's the most important thing where well you know the real most surprising experience is going to be at the job right but what jacob did here very interestingly is you know even though he didn't have much experience he's still right zero experience did you how much c plus parts did you know tell me man i mean literally like i went to pointers and maybe vectors and that was it like i just knew a little bit about algorithms so i couldn't really build any application with it like it was all command line tools right maximum that so that was it but anyway right i applied to all of those companies i failed all of them but still i was like okay i want to learn german and english and work abroad i have i want to have my internship so i was like okay when they also speak in german oh there's austria so i played to austria man also 50 companies yeah like i was like let's do it i failed i felt i failed and there's this one company they i went through interview process uh i i asked like i answered a couple of questions and then uh they said man like they called me after a few days that yeah you in i was like no but then and then i was like i was like super excited and then i asked what we will be doing there on during this internship man the lady was talking to me for like 20 minutes and i couldn't understand anything out of it i was like yeah yeah okay sounds interesting yeah i totally know until again all this you just couldn't you know i totally know i got this i've done this before no problem so ever can you see for you guys in about one week okay no don't have to worry about this whatsoever right so that's funny at this point i was so excited that i was like yeah i'm going there so i went there uh alone actually like it was like 1 000 kilometers from my hometown i didn't know anyone also in this city i would actually it was in the salzburg it's very nice city in austria the company was named skidata actually they are really big in west europe and yeah the internship like the problem with the internship was that i was about to reboot and build extension to the app which was already there and the app was built in uh java and in the framework called spring man when i saw that when i saw it i was literally shooting my pants man i didn't know what to do like i literally i literally so why i i couldn't understand anything out of it again my english wasn't very good but i had my own boss right so literally for seven days i was researching everything about java about this framework and after work so i was doing there i was working there eight hours even more then i was going home i was doing research more and more because at some point i was like wow they would just kick me from the intern internship and after seven days uh i literally gave up and i said hey look um i think like that i won't be able to build that like this java framework spring is just it's too much for me and to be honest i have the most experience with python and i was very lucky because my my boss actually understood that and he said okay look jacob really uh yeah this is like a code base it doesn't have to be coded in this framework i understand that this might be tough especially that is your first job and we want you to bring you like give you as much experience and show you processes as we can so uh he said he suggested that okay use your framework to build that right and i was like okay i was literally googling how to build python application a web application because it was a web application then i discovered django man and i i literally for i was there almost uh three months i literally learned like a very solid uh jungle base i would say and i rebuilt the whole thing for them and in the end they were really uh really happy with that so i accomplished my internship that's crazy so you rebuilt their whole project so basically they initially they give you they give this to you in java and you're like holy i literally can't do this which by the way i just want to say it takes a lot of gusts to come to to come up to someone and say i can't do it right the problem becomes is a lot of people say that oh i can't i can't i can't i can't do right and they get into this mindset of being afraid to say that something they can't and so they lie and they lie and the thing is that people on the other hand they can see you lying so badly sometimes like because i do interviews with a lot of people right and i can see when people lie like i interview people interview developers i can see when you're lying i'll sometimes in my mind i just want to say listen just tell me you don't know or just tell me that you can't and we'll figure this out together you see what i mean and it's a sad part about this right but it's all about communication right it's all about communication exactly what it is very brave you went ahead and you actually basically you told them hey you know what i'm going to go ahead and say i can't do this but here's the solution but we can try in a different manner so we actually came up with a different solution right which was the jingle with python correct and i rebuilded the whole thing from scratch because again he already had a coast base in the spring and i had to extend that i was like there's no way i'll extend that so i'll build whole thing which was already there from scratch and then on top of that i'll bet on other features and yeah through those months it worked out and it was really good because we just had a date daily meetings when he was just talking about those features and i was like brainstorming with him man like it's been the best experience in my life uh regarding like starting a job as a as a developer it really gave me that boost later on in the getting the new job like i've never had a problem to get a new job because after that when i quit uh university because like that's a funny story that right after this internship i remember you quit university is that correct yeah right after this internship i came back to university and man it's been so boring because i had all of this experience being abroad alone meeting those people working the international team uh also like man i i earned in the end almost 6k like i've never earned money before in my life and then it's just 6k like that it was it was just crazy for me of course i had to pay for like a flood and so on but it was all worth it for all those experiences yeah but then being in a university uh on all of those like uh classes and so on i just couldn't stand it anymore because i already started working in the industry and i saw what is necessary to build stuff give value to companies and then they will learn they were teaching us this all and i was like man i can't stand it i was talking to my friend literally i was shaking and i was like man i can't i can't be here i can't stand it i don't know what i will do i i just don't want to be here and at some point i stood up and i just went like sorry what were you learning there like i can't stand it yeah we we were learning java so again java and there was like some old libraries object programming languages uh then like very like we didn't even touch web dev there was like the next year and there was like a lot of those boring uh usual useless subjects with like building some things from like this micro electro like i can i don't know it's the english name for it but you just had to connect a few cables and build some stuff just like man i wasn't interested in this at all i wanted to learn a tools how to program i wanted to new new and the newest frameworks that was another case that they were teaching you all of those old frameworks because they couldn't uh hire professors who are also developers who are working the industry right so this this knowledge i just realized it's all useless of course you will you will get through all of those very tough algorithms and by finishing this university to be honest you will just learn how to learn anything in your freaking life right so once you get the job in the company you'll just survive there because man you just learn the toughest in your college so you will survive of course this is how it works but why don't take a shortcut if you know what to do so i was also passionate about business side always like my whole life and it was never introduced there like at all never zero zero like i always wanted to talk about numbers and stuff like this yeah there was nothing to do like that so i really wanted to get straight into industry so that's why i literally quit then i landed two jobs i picked one and it was like yeah let's go that's awesome i mean look i think that's amazing because like even it just shows that how much what you can do with so little experience right there are jobs that will take you with little experience a lot of you guys and those are in the comments right let us know in the comments if you're somebody who's looking for a job or maybe you want to become a developer right and you're just you're you don't know where to go you're confused right maybe a situation maybe you're stuck in tutorial hell you don't know where to go right whatever it might be let us know in the comments below right but what jacob here can tell you is that even though you might not have much experience there's companies out there that will help you out that will take care of you right the they give you the opportunity let me ask you this question okay why do you think they hired you i think it was uh about my approach they really see that i won it like right now they still they really they really saw that i have the guts to quit university and like work and learn the industry more i also told them and just like the encoding interview because i also had to pass the coding interview so it was a job also related to django because i already know the basics but man it's it's been nothing like the stuff i learned here there in the company it was all i learned so i literally didn't know the difference between get and post requests but i just made the app work at some point man when i check the code base it's also my github man it's it's really messy like i didn't know what to do at all they there was like four and a four into four into four like literally oh yeah that was like that in the beginning so then when i was on the coding interview there was a framework to django which just is responsible for building the api which is django res framework and they were coding mostly into that because they had there was a separate team for front and back end right so you just were about to build backend so they gave me a task and i was like the same i was writing documentation checking the examples and i spent one day with them uh and i solved i solved the whole thing how they wanted but of course it wasn't it wasn't right but they saw this potential how fast i can learn and how good i can communicate with the team because this is also a case that whenever you are freaking good at coding it doesn't mean you are freaking good developer because good developers like when i hire people right now what i really care is not how good you code but how good you can communicate uh especially from the business side when i have when i have a client here's an idea and he wants to talk to developer there's no way they will talk to each other there's no way um they they speak literally at different languages right and it's not just about how good you can code it's also about how good you can smash that like button smash that like button button for the youtube algorithm right that also matters but yeah like it's not just about how well you can i really like the pension that's really cool that was graham stefan type situation you know um yeah yeah yeah so basically you know it's like um it's not just about how good you can cope it's all about your passion and about how good you can learn correct well you show them the fact that you are willing to learn right but what i'm curious that's totally true what's up go ahead uh yeah that's not really true but i also wanted to mention one thing which you brought which is a coding uh tutorial and pro pro like project cell and so on this is why i also really wanted to because at this point i had a gap year right because i quit a university and i wanted to go abroad so i applied to this university where i'm currently but i wanted to work for all time to get the experience and i could choose two ways right i could choose a first way when i just learn technologies i learn and build projects right so i go tutorial of the tutorial but man i don't think it's the case to really get experience you really need to work inside that commercial project because this is where the real users are and they give you the feedback so it's totally different way i i don't recommend you guys like literally don't build project after project my approach is that literally getting to freelancing if you can't land a job and try to build something for someone because this will bring you a lot of experience you will really learn how to uh like build tough stuff and you will be under pressure that's what i would choose right now for about to start yeah now i would just tell to somebody who was like it's wanted to say hey no you go ahead and start out with very simply like just like this it's one thing to say that but it's a whole other thing to actually go ahead and and actually do it that's the hardest thing because a lot of people feel like well you know what i'm not ready they have the imposter syndrome and it makes sense because you really are not ready you don't know the the knowledge behind it right so what kind of a mindset do you have to have to be like no no i'm gonna get started no matter what and i kind of see where it takes me because i interviewed blake connolly as well and he had that same mindset right he started kind of freelancing very much from the getgo without thinking about so much about you know the future instead he just kind of still started to start doing the work and then after that he just kind of learned on the fly exactly i mean there are different kind of people so there are people who just prefer to learn learn learn and just talk about it and there are people who in order to learn they just act they learn through experience and this is my way to do it and i can only say the same regarding the current business which we run right which we go to uh soon again like same story so about coding now it's also about like calisthenics which i'm doing before i was just reading about exercising that but at some point i just sign up for like very experienced group when man like i work with the people who are doing calisthenics for like five seven years i'm the worst there but it's been the best experience ever i mean i'm every day i feel like i i'm literally dying i can't get up from bed but it's the best so really whenever you do in your life i would whenever you want to accomplish something in your life i would literally do it by like accomplish it by doing no matter what does it take of course you will fail and you'll feel very bad in a lot of moment but this is where the all growth comes right yeah that is true that is true i agree i give failure is a big very big part of growth you know we need to do that before we move on so so i understand so you went basically you went to this company correct and this what do you know the name of this company yeah it's kv software company in poznan and i if anyone from the kiwi watches me i greet you guys it's been great time there i mean i got so much experience from it like literally been it's been the best thing that happened to me wow that's amazing this has a lot to say that that's amazing awesome so now in that case that's cool now in that case so after that right you went to this internship and then what kind of happened then right you're working the jingle project how how did you feel now at this point working and like how do you feel like your knowledge was at a point after like a month or two of working in the company i mean it's the first internship so i when i finished internship to be honest yeah i was all shitty still but i had the experience then the company i worked there almost a year and yeah after this year i i was really solid to be honest because it was just djangour's framework all the time um yeah at this point i felt very solid it's still like i i couldn't say i'm the the expert right but it was also a small company that was what was the beautiful thing about that because we just had to get done and most of the times i was literally putting to the huge project and i had to do stuff so it was also a great experience for me and after that like when i moved to germany i also applied uh so then i also like get to the next university and i applied to different companies the funny part is in germany when you're a student you can only work uh 20 hours per week this is a german law really on the contract student on a contract so interesting now it's different because i own my compa own company um so it's different uh so you're a baller now you're like i don't play with the rules now now i mean i just still have to say that i work 20 hours per week because you can't really tell that's a trick in germany i mean right now i have two companies to be honest so one is there's a poland when i'm the cofounder like coowner and then the second single person company in germany when i just do invoices and stuff and so that's how we run it right now but let me tell you about the the funny story about the companies when i applied as a student so i got this university and i already had like a nice experience to get at the company so i applied already to as a mid developer everywhere uh full time and i was going for different uh coding interviews men they were really tough but there was a those these were like positions for like 60 70k euros a year and i passed through different uh coding interviews and there was like the last uh stage when i had to go only through hr thing uh hr interview and man it was all great it was all perfect and in the end i said hey do you have an option to like work 20 hours per week because you see i'm a student and they were shocked they were literally shocked they literally declined me there so at some point i applied also for a different company when they also had their student offer but i got like much more uh salary than a regular student because i applied for also like a different position that was like a tricky hack that i did but again after like seven to eight months i think that was also like a clever programmer uh and then team of clever programmer then i was also like a little bit freelancing at some point as i you remember probably this day i i came up when i called and i said hey guys it's been a great time but i just can't do it anymore because it's like i'm doing almost three jobs i'm studying and it's i just can't i just wanna quit everything yeah restart my whole brain and i already knew that i love business and i want to do something with business yeah so i took vacation yeah yeah and i remember i remember this like uh i remember this very clearly right because you were doing a lot of things you're working with us right you're working with us and you know you're working with us on you know with profit python and of course and just and a lot of different things like challenges and so forth um which was amazing of course and you're a big part of the team um but i know you were doing a lot of different things you had you had an internship that you were working at the same time right plus this also and i think you also did school is that correct or no you're not yeah exactly exactly and also like my own youtube and my own instagram man i've been like it's been like crazy every day like 11 12 hours but but you know what sometimes you gotta do a lot because like you know a lot of people problems is they don't do enough you see what i mean you're doing a lot correct and you can and then you figure out how to slow down is that correct exactly right exactly i just had to reflect on myself because i knew that when you do everything you can't do everything good right so i was like i have so many ideas i wanted to do business i love also like being on a team record videos uh coach other people also i love to code but i just can't do anything there's not enough time and i will just burn out at some point i already had a couple of burnouts uh not like a huge burners but like i just couldn't look at the screen anymore right so yeah i took the decision it's been very tough uh because like i literally quit everything and one day that was very hard what is everything everything what do you mean by everything yeah so i quit working for this one client i quit uh this parttime job in the company i also like i i was like they really liked me i really like it was a really great team so and they're also working with you guys it was also like very uh like nice experience for me i really love that yeah i just show up on every like meeting and i just had to say that yeah this is how it is i i quit and then i had like literally two weeks do enough and just chill and it was great it was really necessary and then of course at some point you just if you do so many things that you take vacation at some point you you are so chill that those ideas are coming again to you right you are so relaxed and men that was a first idea when which was born that i wanna be a freelancer right now i think it's a great thing to do then my cofounder wojtek he had the same idea that he would quit his job he will become a freelancer and then at this point it was so funny because we were like hey man i mean we can freelance together hey isn't it like agency or something maybe we could do something together who knows exactly so we team up and man it that was just the beginning it was it was great that's awesome that's awesome and so hold on so i kind of want to kind of want to even step back a little bit from that right because like you went into this right and you kind of quit everything that you were doing right all these different jobs and so forth and was it really because you want to do something different or was it because you were just tired and needed a break it wasn't really about being tired i could i could do that um definitely it was just something in my inside me talking to myself that i want to build something on my own i just i don't know i just felt this this way that whenever i work on something i just i love that it's it's like mine it's for example right i built my own instagram even though i was doing doing a lot of things for clever programming i was still doing this because it felt like it's literally like my thing it's it's me it's my personal brand and now company same thing right now of course we are doing custom projects for a client so it's like kind of we still have a boss our boss our our bosses are our clients i would say so right it's it's we exchange time for money for them but at the same time we are building a brand selfmade and we are building the crm we are building a client base so whenever we have i don't know in three years let's say 100 clients this is recurring income already right the maintenance the new features this is this is already a thing we are building a developer team uh designer team this is all like a asset for us uh so go ahead yeah this is like a different like my mindset this is why i really enjoy that i really feel that i wanna do something like that that's awesome that's amazing and so okay so then you decide to basically quit everything you and you're like you know what i'm gonna start a software agency okay so let's get into that right what happened there how did you get started what are the first things that you did to go ahead and get started on something like this tell me man it's been a mess so i photo so i i already had like 30 or 40 000 instagram followers like three thousand youtube youtuber right and i was like wow i know a lot about marketing it it would be probably easy to get the first clients and so on man i would be killing it i was so like i know cocky yeah okay yeah maybe also uh but no to be honest man it's been much harder than i thought like it turned out that instagram or other social medias they are usually usually perfect for b2c which is a business to clients so when you have a product and you sell them to typical people those are your clients then it's not customers and customers yeah yeah then it's usually also the product is not that expensive uh but you can scale it easily but when you run your agency then you do bit b2b which is business to business business to business and i did a research i checked the agency so it's like hey man they have no instagrams they know facebook but then they have those big brands working with i was like how do they do that right and then i started re reading about it and i was like wow b2b is totally different game i have no idea about that and also like the thing where we started the agency with wojtek uh we both had savings for like two maybe three months because i also pay for my uni i pay for my flood and stuff like this so yeah i had some savings it was also like why i quit was like okay now i literally have a savings for next two three months so i really i mean i will figure it out because i know myself under the pressure if i have this pressure and yeah at some point i won't have any money i mean man yeah i would go back to different job like i have this safety that i can always come back to the job but now i want to do something more so this is how it was born and yeah we're just starting to asking people literally hey you are freelancers we want to be freelancers or like agency so you start getting go ahead yes yeah as well as to say uh who and uh stuff like this so like that was the first step like reading online articles how to freelance how to the clients and then also literally talking to the people and i'm not gonna i'm not gonna lie uh actually blake connelly was one of my best inspirations because like i knew already uh him from instagram like i knew that you guys were working together i literally asked him for like one quick interview for like 20 30 minutes and he agreed on that which is like crazy like i literally was like willing to pay him for this time because i know how much he works how many important things he has to do and yeah he agreed and then he introduced us the upwork the upwork whole upwork game and he said it will be very hard like he mentioned that a couple of times but we we still didn't really believe that it can be that hard and then we went to our pork man it's been so hard like like literally we actually had like both this nice experience is almost like 2.5 almost three years of experience working the industry right and we went to upwork and man to lend our first client it's been literally like a grinding like 20 days 5 to 10 proposals every single day wow and we couldn't even get to anyone to answer our proposal because on upwork you have a few stages so first you need to find a client you need to send him the proposal he need to text you back then you kind of get on a call and then you have to close him so it's like a long process right to close someone and all and whenever someone um like posts a job offer um like after like one hour i don't think it's even worth to apply applying there because there's like already 20 other people applied right so it's very hard it's very hard to be noticed especially in the beginning where you have no badges no job successes no income earned there's like literally the hardest part on upwork so wow we made it actually we made it after i don't know two or three weeks um i landed the first guy it was something about amazon automation it was the first time first client and it was like okay i have no idea about amazon automation that they have api i was like i'm doing this i'm doing this so we got on a call figure it out he told me yeah yeah i will figure it out man i have to um so he told me about this amazon nws thing there was like a documentation he said what he wants there's also something about gcp which is google out platform and i was like okay let's do it and yeah i was working extremely hard for like two or three weeks and i earned like five hundred dollars which is like literally nothing as a developer for this kind of time but man i mean that's a thing right right sorry 500 in two weeks almost free so it was very tough working like crazy but man i've never was happier like that was literally like this 500 dollars fit like i know 10k right now or something like that it's it's been crazy how happy i was was because then i had a very nice comment on my profile uh 100 job succeed and i also got some batch from upwork so so so so tell me this tell me this okay what do you think allowed you to get this client okay like what was it is it the proposal that you made because of course you've been in proposals for the best to pass two three weeks at this point right but what you what got you that client tell me uh so yeah there are a couple of things tonight this is also how i like learned for to them this is actually after two weeks because we already like even buy those points on upwork that you can actually send more proposals so like we spend like 10 bucks or 20 bucks to even land a client uh so yeah what we learned uh in the beginning is that that your proposal needs to be extremely unique and gives a lot of value in the beginning like literally we kind of figure out this formula that when you send the up upwork proposal in this proposal you kind of need to give the guy solution so once we apply this pattern it really started working out like literally we got like 50 uh answers after that so the guy wanted to do some google amazon nws i sent him the python library link to github that hey this is a pi this library i think we can use that and then i think we can deploy the app on the gcp and i also link this stuff and yeah i just wrote him like that and he was like oh man you look like you have some kind of experience there and there let's talk and then he he got on a talk with me i talked about the experience and situation man because he said yeah i i'm not gonna lie it's like you are new here you don't have any uh stars and anything i'm kind of like i don't know if i should trust you but i mean looks like you you're fine so let's do it so he also i was lucky i was lucky he also wanted to help me right and the same happened to vojtec when we both applied this formula so we kind of get on upward i don't know maybe to 10 000 overall earnings but at some point we didn't really like it and the reason is that from my point because i i didn't really like it because uh i'm really shitty when it comes to texting like writing to people i'm better with talking and on upwork you have to be really good at texting so voider at some point was getting a lot of different clients but i couldn't so i was like okay let's switch the model business model again and then uh our second stage of this but before before you go into that before you go into that okay so you were doing upwork and so forth and you said that you were able to earn around ten thousand dollars on upwork is that what you said um it was in the first month overall overall because we are doing this upper thing also from time so we have like uh me and voitek together i think it might be 10k but probably less but yeah this is we got it after like two or three months so we could literally do it all the time but only the reason why uh i didn't want to do it because i had to text to people and i had it so overall nothing against upwork i think it's a great platform especially for freelancers also if you want to do an agency it's really good like we could be a really good agency there i know that blake earns like crazy on upwork and it works uh but yeah again it depends on the personality uh i prefer to go to people i prefer to meet people in person in order to close them um i feel like also i'm much better in this so that's why we changed that that comes to me to another question because somebody asked for they asked why don't you look for clients locally yeah this is another this is actually stage two of uh selfmade so yeah this is what we did so we asked okay how can we get clients again so i already had couple of nice connections on actually through which i made through instagram in berlin and people were freelancing or they own their own agencies and i was going to them and i was just talking to them uh and there was hendrick from milli and he always talked to me that hey man try to reach out to your network but my problem is that i just moved to berlin right like one year ago or something i was starting then the corona started i didn't have any network at all my parents are not any like i.t technicians or anything my mother is the teacher so they know nothing we don't have any connection poland uh but also like we didn't want to do it in poland at this point we just wanted to be here in germany and work for german clients so yeah we didn't have any network but i was like okay let's do it anyway and then i literally was going online on different slack communities especially like the coworking space which i i'm right now and i was talking to people a lot and then those guys they got to us and we started the first collaboration then there was a second guy who reached out to us uh he was working for some company who is doing a hand handmade letters but they are actually created by a machine so it's very interesting business model yeah so we built they also project for them and then once you actually uh build a great project for someone and also for net like you shouldn't be very expensive in the beginning you should provide as much value as you can this is as you can this is the most important thing when landing your first clients i mean overall like always like the value is the most important that's what what might what do you have what mindset do you have when you go into for example to talk with the client um so they at this point they were all recommended right so we already knew that they want some kind of the project we proposed them the solution for that we say how we can do that and we agreed on some prices and those prices are really low uh because we just wanted to start so those are projects for like 2.5 or 3k uh euros i mean it's not like they are very low but if you run your business you have to pay taxes on your own and taxes in german is like half percent uh like 50 so in the end it's like very shitty like still if we are just doing uh nine to five as developers it's like most more like just profitable no stress nothing right but we just wanted to do that anyway so we built those things for those two guys and this is how it started because at this point like the guy was the ceo of this company and he has a lot of different network connections so he recommended us to other guys and this is how he kind of started there in germany also the second guy he also landed some clients he already had nice experience working with us so he gave us another product and meanwhile we are also searching for other people in other places so this is how we do it uh when you say searching what do you mean by searching like locally around you yes like with the same with the same uh model so we go on those communities we say that hey we are agency uh we looking for a project and so on we are happy to talk about some automation ideas and stuff like this uh even though at some point we uh we wanted to get into the niches so our first niche where we wanted to get in was the marketing niche because we already did like a lot of automations with like shopify amazon ad spent uh we aggregate aggregated the data we displayed in google sheets and we will and then i started literally talking to agency owners i asked them for literally an interview and asked them for their processes and they were getting me a data for free because it wasn't a sales call they just literally were talking okay we are using this software i think in this server this sucks i know literally noting this all down building my own database but at the same time we didn't really know if we want to do it so we are just kind of getting clients i would say randomly because of other connections they were just approaching us so we are really lucky at this point and i would do like a quick um like a time travel to the point where are we right now because literally right now at this point we are launching self pain self made 2.0 which is uh so i have a new cofounder the third guy who joined us and this is uh how we kind of start again but with the whole mindset which we developed over the last eight months so right now we are literally going over the one niche which is the automotive that's like a journey which we want to kind of start right now so it's still software it's still custom software as we do like right as we were doing over the last eight months but it's all around one niche now you're asking why it's yeah perfect question so over the last eight months we are just doing everything for everyone uh we said that we are the auto automation agency but in the end we also were building some kind of websites uh because we just hit the project we just had to take the project so we are learning a lot about different integrations different industries uh and this brought us to the moment where we are right now where we actually finally saved uh some money so the title which you have right sixfigure agency is this is happened like literally like recently when we started doing this right the first two three months has been like 1k 2k 3k 4k right we are we were growing but over the last few months you're talking about like earnings like four keep a month two keep a month earnings right and i just make sure be very clear this but with you guys is this is okay like a lot of you guys think that you know on foreign fortunate a lot of a lot of developers when they go into freelancing like i'm gonna be a millionaire that's it i'm gonna have a lot of money i can travel wherever i want and this could be a great life right and unfortunately right that's not the case right because i myself have been a freelancer as well jacob here he started philanthropy of course as well and you guys can see that it is not the case right not very much the case at all because it's a lot of hours and you start out with shitty money potentially right yeah it's basically no matter how much experience you have right in terms of coding you might ask that with your business set up for the bottom because you have not built your reputation in the freelancer world initially at all right exactly it's a long marathon it's not a sprint exactly exactly and so now you say you're getting one take 1k 2k 3k and so just tell me now that when you guys were going into with focus on the automotive stuff which is when you focus on motor stuff give me some examples like what kind of projects you're building in the automotive industry exactly so we just picked this niche it's not like we are still in the research phase so in two three weeks when we talk to like 100 people we might decide that we actually change change it to different one but the thing is again to the earnings right finally like we had this first month i think it was like january or february when we actually hit 10k that was the next month was 20k and it was like it was it was crazy it was also accumulated because uh when you do agency when you are freelancer it's very hard to get your first projects people don't trust you and usually they don't even agree to pay upfront and they don't agree to pay hourly so we had this one project actually couple of projects that we are building this over four months and in the fourth month we just we just saw the money right so it will all the investment that we didn't even for that we'll see the money so this is how we also accumulated this but that's the best thing that i mean me and wojtek we were we are young and in order to survive for us like 2k for a person is enough um wow that's the the best size and that that's the best thing and now when we have like more money it changes my mindset because it's not like okay now i'm going to i don't know release a porsche right it's not the case i would never do that like i mean maybe somewhere in the future right but now i see the potential of it that wow i have the budget so i can literally focus on the niche do a research if i have the previous clients i can get a developer hire him he will be part of our team i will build a brand we'll actually pay for a marketing will pay for a content and do some run some ads like this is what a whole money will be from for investment in the company so we are finally in the moment that we can do it this is also why we're doing the whole rebranding the new logo which is actually on the thumbnail of it it's not released yet only on youtube uh the new totally new website this is how we will use that right so we just started uh those bigger numbers we are very excited um but yeah we're also very humble about that because it's been very tough eight months to be where are we and to be honest like we're just starting man like it's a long long game like um so yeah this is how it is it's a very long game right it's a it's an interesting game right um i've been this game as well of course um so and you guys started basically now doing this niche right the automotive niche right and you guys seen it you know you guys seen bigger numbers from previous projects of course now at this point now what are you going to do how are you going to reinvest the money back right a lot of money a lot of people they might might get the money they're invested that you might spend it somewhere what's the goal here when you go ahead and make money as a south agency what is the goal now with that money tell me i'm just kidding i'm a christmas tree because i can tell you where we spend it here at our company here yeah so i'm curious so normally whenever we have a project a client i just do everything by myself uh because i didn't even know how i could uh spend that i would want to save as much as i can but now having this mindset i can bring some new developer and just uh spend this money on him right so hire him reinvest the money even though if this can fail we we learn how to work with other people so it's a perfect learning opportunity same with ads same with whole marketing around that also i'll be able to finally not um just work on coding part which just brings money but do actually a research so no one will pay me for meetings like no one paid me for meetings before even with their clients right but now we are talking to potential clients we are talking to the business owners in automotive niche and those are just the meetings 30 minutes but it can be very very time consuming over like a next few few weeks so this is also like just a the safety net for the future for us to pay ourselves in the future because yeah i think that that's the difference between like a startup uh approach when you get the founding grounds and so on but just an agency uh model it's it's completely different how many how many people do you guys have working with you i know you told me on the contractor basis you guys have been working with how many people do you work with on a regular basis tell me yeah so right now we have three people working with plus uh two other founders so it's like we are a team of six but uh sometimes we have like some other people bring you on for like some kind of consultations whenever there's a project that we really uh need an expert but we kind of know how to build that and those experts are too uh expensive to build it we just hire them for consultations to ask uh about those things so this is my way that's a pretty smart so basically instead of hiring the person right the developer you hire them as a consultant and they keep building yourself so you basically get the knowledge from them but you're also not paying for the hours at the same time you just kind of build them by yourself basically yeah we would rather pay them like even 200 uh dollars per hour right wow to validate our current solution which we work on a whole week rather than hire them for a full time because then it's like crazy and at this point we also can't charge clients that the crazy money um how much i miss this question i mean if you want to if you don't want to say that that's fine too how much do you how much do you on regular basis charge per hour for a client like it's still it's still uh it's we can't say uh the average because it really is different on the project uh like there's one client when we can charge him 30 euros per hour then sometimes 50 but it all depends on the situation where are we at and again hourly pricing and fixed pricing is totally different game yeah um there is a lot of negotiating coming to this so it's it's very hard to tell how much we earn actually per hour because taking under consideration how much we work during a week it will be still i'm still we earn less that if we were working fulltime as developers that i can tell you clearly because like when you work as a developer as in the company let's say eight hours a day then you really code for four hours then you have a couple of meetings especially right now remote work yeah that's my experience but when you work for someone else like he's your client then every hour really count because if you don't really focus on this hour then you're burning this time no one will pay you for that especially on the fixed price contract it's different approach so that's true that's true now also we failed so many times sorry i know i mean i've been there too honestly now do you do fixed price projects as well because when i was doing the adjustments what's up it's just fixed price it's very hard to even talk about oh it is just fixed price it's almost impossible to get to the point of hourly contracts like we usually wait two hours projects because all i hear from them is do not do fixed price projects of course but it's also almost impossible to to get hourly clients like talking to ex from my experience is just impossible so we usually have uh maintenance contracts for hourly but then we also talk about kind of like a fix so what does it take to fix this bug this is how it is right now maybe at some point we'll get to the point where blake is but for now it's just yeah we are still too early in this game right it's just eight months and now we are taking some serious moves regarding the niche um so that's how it is tell me what are some biggest things that you had to change within you when starting something like this like internally what did you have to change tell me um so yeah before when i was just doing jobs there was not really a huge responsibly responsibility on my side so whenever there was a feature for example in corporate world um i knew that if i don't do it for tomorrow like they can blame me or something but nothing really happens overall they have tons of money and stuff like this i'm nothing in this corporate leather i knew that right and at some point i was getting very lazy because of that because it was like unfair advantage that i'm really good at people and if i really don't want to do something i won't do it but then i will like force myself to do it so even working in a company 20 hours per week i could easily do my task over like four to five hours and the whole team i was literally asking boss if it's all good they were like super proud and stuff like this right so i was literally getting bored and lazy at the same time which is really bad but here yeah as i told you already there's no way of kind of cheating there's no way because if you don't do stuff then you just don't get paid and yeah it's totally different i'm just more motivated to work than ever also like i love it so much that i always am into that like whenever i don't even work or code i always have some kind of business ideas that we want to develop so it's it's different yeah that's awesome so somebody asked somebody asked here but the rasheed asks what is the niche about right so the automotive niche right go a little bit deeper deeper into that what do you mean by that are you guys building you know dashboards for automotive companies what does that look like so yeah that's the thing that we uh we already have three projects now portfolio and automotive which are totally different so one is about uh scanning cars the vista scanning solutions uh company from us uh this is all about gathering data from different scans uh priests can post kind of um diagnostic scans and stuff like this uh so we are working there and helping them out a lot then that was like one part so it's more about literally a very specific knowledge in the industry of cars like all about the car parts um then the third one is actually uh for dana um they approached us with the scrapers so we had to build a very custom scrapers for them to cover like uh a competitor uh gaskets i'm not i can't say more about it because we have some contracts there and so on but this is what i might have today tell uh so that's the different uh thing so it's all about automation and the third guy uh that was our recent client we just finished the page is uh about he's at car dealership who's exporting cars from switzerland to poland and actually we built uh some kind of also a scrapers and automation tools for them for for them actually yeah and in the end they have a whole car platform when people from poland can bat cars um and they are like responsible just for delivering the cars and handle all of the um like payment and other stuff processes so it's also helping them a lot so those are three different projects but in the automotive niche so currently we are check we are asking other car dealerships if there's any way that we could maybe build for them or like who are they processing the a their company we are not talking the small guys more like to the bigger guys i know that there's a lot of different crm systems for just car dealerships and yeah we just in the research phase so also nas if you know someone for automotive niche like i would be happy to talk to them of course and do their research here on the youtube live if you guys and know anybody from the automotive niche you can find jacob at his instagram jacob wait wait hold on what's your instagram hold on jakobski youtube jakobowsky or just self made of them let me show it to you guys you guys let me show it to you guys so you guys can see it g kubowski so let me see i'll show it to you guys jacob jacob right there right there jakubowski right here there it is i think it's good i think it's just reverted but it's good i think it's mirrored actually that's why actually if i unmirror myself maybe maybe they'll work out look at this on the photo i'll comment in the comments oh now it's good yeah that should be nice perfect so you guys can reach him out on that specific on that instagram i don't know why i wear myself the whole time because i actually think this is better right here i kind of like this when i hear better yeah so but anyways so that's really cool so that's your you're basically on a different automotive industry in and you're trying this nation this niche potentially might work out because you know one thing i realized that when i was starting to do it started a software agency is you get to you kind of have to build everything everything for everybody and it's not fun because you just diverted into so many different places you know this one part like i mean i remember when i was doing this i was doing seo i was doing you know you know wordpress i was doing literally you know jingle and then react js and like there's all these different projects that you have to do and it's just not i don't know it's just not fun when you do when you there's no niche right so like not focused if if there is like a serious big company they just want to work with the best and to get to the best you have to be the best like really so also like this is just start bing automotive agency let's say so right software agency for automotive it's not also uh deep enough in my opinion but this is a great start so the process like i mean this will take like next two three four years but i already have a next steps for it so first like that's the worst thing is that i myself in vojtec which we started like we are developers we have no idea about any industry problems and so on we just knew coding but at the end of the day coding is a tool so you don't really solve any business business cases you don't really provide the value that's why you are a developer which is totally perfect most of the people just want to be developers that's totally perfect um like you are basically also tool right you have managers above you which are just experts in the industry they know where the value comes from but when you start agency and you know nothing about the industry itself it's very tough so that's why we want to niche down do a lot of interviews talk to experts and then see how we can actually use this tool and help them and that would be the step first step so still custom coding for automotive uh industry and then let's say after three or four years when we really really build a lot of projects around that we may come to the we may come to the point where we have really nice team a really nice expert expert knowledge and we will change to the sas company because building the sas company is very very hard people don't earn money for like two three years some people like most of the people who are building sas software they have totally wrong approaches just going to investors uh getting the money and they they usually fail it's it's a very different topic but i have this health i would say mindset to it that we first tackled down a lot of different problems see where's actually see where is the potential to build the perfect sauce uh actually being being there already solve those problems and then maybe come up with something that we already uh have a clients also who are who want to pay for that because a lot of people build this sas pro like they build products then they go out and they ask for feedback no one's really want that right so they spend like eight months one year they do it soon they so don't see any money at all and they just quit because no one wants that so yeah i think this is the nice nice longterm vision for building a sas company where there's a goal because there's a scale for that right you don't have to come up with the whole code base you don't have to find clients all the time right it's kind of like this is you know do it once right it's sell sell it you know many times i think that's the bottle right for a sass business right um and i i haven't told you this but we're actually internally building something sas as well internally here we're building something that will help students a lot a lot of students that kind of learn right and work in a building internally to kind of use it internally within us and who knows they might might go out to multiple people at some points in the future and that's the thing because you already have a lot of experience in the industry that you know what people want right and you have a group of people that you can deliver this to them right and they will give you a feedback and then you can improve the software and maybe go abroad with it that's a perfect approach for this so tell me jake i want to ask you this one question okay what excites you my friend like what excites you about what you're doing what excites me what i'm doing i mean overall that we can really have impact in the world that we can really like help other people and solve their problems like i think by the end of the day seeing how our clients are happy is the best like it's it's just it's yeah it's totally what i really love so when i was just a developer with a team like of course like boss boss could say that yeah great job of course that was really nice but now when i really see that we can save or earn people earn money for our clients it's just the best thing in the world or also that we are building our internal team and the collaboration with us is great that we can pace uh and actually provide jobs to other people man it is crazy and also like building the brand uh i mean it was always my dream starting from personal brand now to more like a broad brand it's another factor which just drives me on daily basis i think the most so that's awesome what do you think what kind of mindset do you think need to have in order to be able to build something like this like what might you to have when you go into like a software you see or you go into freelancing what do you think um yeah so i mean from like my mindset i think that in the end i'm not scared of failing at all i actually love to learn from my own uh mistakes it's it's very hard to to build this because it it it's very painful most of the time like the consult with the negotiations which i had to gone through like it's been really stressful like i had those days where i literally couldn't code at all there was very a lot of stress coming because those snitches they needed to be done but at the same time i had to just handle the negotiation part meeting part so it takes a lot it's hard uh but i don't know by the end of the day i when i zoom out and i see a like a long picture like a big picture i'm happy of my results from back right so you see the chart day by day it looks like a sinus like literally and there's a fail there's a wind there's a there's a win but overall the trend is going like this right so it's going up like but you just really need to think long long term yeah this is actually what gave me the biggest mindset and i think that gary vaynerchuk like he uh taught me this a lot because i was like reading his books listing his podcast and watching his content so i think that he taught me that yeah yeah he's very much about you know long term he's very much about kind of doing you know things and just being persistent with them right you know and not just trying to get the most out of the current situation right um it's very much about you know what just work at it give it some time of course right and so forth learn from your mistakes and because the biggest thing that people have is they give up right like even i partially i want to say i partially gave up i mean i didn't give up like because i had this i mean i still have the software agency right um but i just don't take any clients right now at this point right and nor do i want to um but the reason why i did this because i decided to go someplace else but just try to do something more more of what i love right which is what i'm doing right now which is i get to teach all the students i get to build courses and so forth and i get to be part of an amazing team and of course and um yeah so i kind of did that right but a lot of a lot of people they'll get into this with a lot of high expectations thinking you don't need much work and then and then you know ninety percent is extremely it's extremely hard so if you are like i don't know a quitter you just don't do it at this point it's not worth it uh you just need to know that you'll fail badly feel like a most of the days but overall if you zoom out it'll be nice no it's it it was like that like a lot a lot i had a lot of tough uh also conversation with my founder like we had a lot of different kind of views on the company we still have and overall it's all hard but yeah it excites me at the same time so that's why i'm doing it and also i think that will be a different opinion than blake had because i also heard the previous podcast with him like i know that when he started agency that he already was working somewhere and he could actually do both at the same time for me it wasn't the case if i do something i do it all in so i really need to save some money for those two three months and then quit everything and then the worst scenario is like i fail miserably i can always go back get another job so for me that was the case that i really had to decide be under the pressure and like literally have the survival mindset that if i won't do anything for next to three months i literally won't survive i don't need to move to parents or something so yeah that was my approach to this and i know that there are a lot of people who need to do the same yeah that's interesting but it's not the only way you can also keep your job and start your own yeah there's multiple ways to go about it um tell me this i'm very curious what is the hardest project that you had to do like what is the hardest project where maybe you lost money because you had to hire someone or you know it was a toughest project that you had to go through you know i've had my sheriff projects where literally it was a fixed price project so i thought it would take this amount of time it took a lot more i'm like holy next time no you know i'm losing money like what are some of the toughest parts that you that you that you did yeah so we had a free body experiences hiring people um it wasn't really about losing a lot of money fortunately we are lucky enough to do that but we also don't operate on those like super crazy prices yet right yeah like our biggest project but also over a few months has been like maybe 27k so if more projects but there are lower prices so there's nothing to lose that much and that's why also it's like let's say safe because me and my cofounder we have really good coders so we can always go and code it for ourselves but we had those situation that i hired someone and then i was asking for a fee for feedback and stuff like this i was checking and then after one week i was like hey we need to have it on monday it was like literally sunday morning and then the guy showed me that he literally has nothing i was like wow we had nothing and we had to do that so i literally like worked 24 hours straight and just build the mvp for the guy and showed up and i saved the project and the whole um relation with the client right wow so i had to do those sacrifices then actually it's the upwork thing it's also funny it wasn't about hiring but i hired a friend for design part because like there was a twostep process that we had to first give them designs and then code it so i hired the guy and then uh it was actually um a project with some people from korea i think and then uh they give me like kind of a paper visualization of the project of some dashboard and they said okay do it in a figma in a modern way so my friend is really good he's extremely good in figma he designed it in a really nice modern way and then um they had to have it ready on like tuesday hour morning in germany and i was like sending everything to them monday evening and then their ceo which i never saw again in my life they she called me and she said that this is completely wrong that it cannot be like that so i would say they kind of scammed me uh because she literally sent me a totally new different visions with different things and they say it needs to be ready for tomorrow i'm like what the i i just did what the guy asked me to do in the beginning here's the results and i was like okay i can't do that like let's like close this contract i won't give you any stars and i won't charge you for anything on upwork but please don't give me any bad opinion but unfortunately they didn't give me any bad opinion but unfortunately during upwork you have the success uh job rate right so basically it went down to like 80 or something so we weren't any more hundred percent and it up on upwork also that was the reason why we quit there because i was really pissed with this situation and in the end i had to pay my friend uh who is a designer just for my pocket money uh for that because of course he did what he wanted that he needed to do yeah that was like you think it's it's yeah again it's very hard and tough and most of the time so those are the situation and now the hardest part i think it was like this scraping project for uh dana that we delivered like it was extremely hard to build those scrapers that weren't the scrapers you see normally in the tutorials in the on youtube um they were all dynamic scrapers you to just handle the javascript and there was like literally millions of data uh so we built those scrapers but they were like very old pages and sometimes the javascript didn't really work and we had to literally go a few times over the whole like iterate over this page a few times we had like 40 different machines running on those pages in order to do it about it yeah on the gcp but even then it took like like i don't know 30 hours to even script whole thing and then i sent them the data and then sent they sent me data from like four years before and then it was less data right now it's like what the heck i'm like then i run it again run it again and i had to create another custom script we just combined the data and to delete duplicates and we are good but man it was very stressful also because i i also didn't sleep for like 24 hours just like rating with the guy checking on those computers if they are still running so yeah but it's been fun it's been fun we learned a lot tough times tough times holy that's insane so i mean you guys can see right like you know the reason why you ask this question a lot of times is again they showcase the reality of situations right like this can be hard like i've been in situations where i had this client who wanted this uh project and you know literally you know fixed our fixed price project and i told him hey it's gonna cost you seven thousand dollars right you know for like 60 hours or something but you know as we're doing it he wanted more and more and more and next to you know the project is like 300 that's the hours that's the case which happens to us yeah yeah 300 hours in and you and you cannot charge the client more i could not charge the client more right because i was willing to pretty much do anything to just to get a good review from the client exactly i still had to pay people exactly like dave the clients usually thinks that those things are included in the project but you never talk about before right so we also wanted to finish the project like we thought we literally before we end up finally getting paid for a project we finished it i think like eight times with more and more features which client thought they were in right so there were also situations like that but that's why you are also not putting all of the uh x in one bucket i would say when it comes to clients that's why we overall work for i think 14 different clients um and that's why we went and we are where we are right now that's awesome that's awesome so tell me how does your next five years look like where do you see yourself kind of go in the next five years tell me jacob i think five maybe it's a little bit too much uh definitely i don't want let's say in the next one year yeah definitely one year uh definitely we want to focus down on the one niche i don't know if it will be automotive finish i hope it will be with our approach right now uh i will not definitely double down right now on the whole marketing side and literally create like a b2b marketing part uh go back to youtube videos because in the by the end of the day actually youtube is crazy when it comes to getting clients like i created this one video for amazon mws which was kind of my first project on upwork i gave this solution on a youtube video there's no videos on the whole amazon nws i got literally like 30 or 40 potential emails for clients so i know it works and i have already this nice idea how i can approach the automotive niche i already have a kind of like i think 30 scrapers in 30 days for different marketplaces so man i have a lot of um ideas for it so that's definitely i think we want to grow a team uh that's definitely and at some point i want to uh i i would say not really focus on coding that much so in the whole selfmade um let's say life's a life span there were some moments when in the beginning i was doing a lot of marketing so trying to get a lot of leads and i was coding and then at some point i was just jealous of my cofounder that he always calls he gets a really nice coding experience like man i want to code a lot right now and over five last months i was just coding like 10 day 10 hours a day i would say on average man i can't look at this anymore i mean i have this sometimes really i want to get back to growing actually um a company doing a marketing getting on a client's calls uh meetings uh growing the team but also at the same time also like coding because i just love it right but it was at those stages so yeah yeah that's for sure i think it's so funny because i when i was when you were working with us i remember from you as well you're like man i just can't wait to code again i miss cutting so much you know all the time i hear from you just i miss cody i want to code you know and then here you tell me like i couldn't like i've heard it for five months i'm like i'm done with this yeah yeah yeah it's like something that's not a thing that i think that's why i think i might be a good fit to this that i could be let's say a ceo because i know a little a lot about coding so i know how to talk about the technique technical part but i also am very interested in the business side so that's why i really like this part that's awesome some somebody here asked a really good question amg asked what mindset are you looking for when hiring so like when you when you hire developers on upwork or whatever else might be do you look for specifically something or no tell me um so yeah with hiring you are very um career like i would say it's a very slow process for us uh and because we failed so many times right now we are mostly hiring my recommendations and that's part one and also when it comes to mindset i really want those guys to be part of our team so even though right now we can't afford like a fulltime yet developers right we want to um hire them for those contracts that that one day they will work with us fulltime so that's mostly the mindset that they want to work with the industry they're willing to learn new things uh because at some point i would love uh to build a lot of uh content around the company agency like podcasts videos and stuff like this so if they will also be interested in this thing that would be perfect i don't want to force anyone to do it that's perfectly fine right but if they are also willing to do those things man that's like a dream so wait wait wait wait you're saying you want to build up do a podcast or build a podcast what are you talking about you know like overall when it comes to like marketing part of our company i would love to like create a podcast more youtube content instagram content and so on so if our employees if they would love to show up on those things that i would be the happiest guy in the world so yeah i mean they would really believe in their brand right so they are really part of the brand of this family i would love that brand is so powerful brand is literally everything honestly like jacob like that's the one thing we realized here at a clever program right is like even for example we have a boot camp that we started here at clever program right it's a boot camp that you know that takes people you know towards becoming developers in early six months and because they've had so much brand over all these years we've been able to be been able to start this up really really fast and actually have a lot of demand for from other students right because of that um and we kind of just realized i'm holy because every time i get a call with a person who's who does want to join the boot camp they're like oh i saw this video or i saw you guys here i saw you guys in this video or in this video on this video right or saw you guys on instagram or even a tick tock right and like oh this is so cool like it's crazy how much how much brand has so much pop not power but like there's so much value right you know it's like what kind of like what um garyvee gary always says you know jab jab jab right hook right so jab jab jab give val give out give back and ask right very quickly right very and then not very quickly but then ask after that right and realize that that's such a like keeping that in check is so important keep it then in check and not always asking is such an important ask it's not such an important aspect and instead just always kind of trying to give value put yourself out there right because what you're creating is you create a family like that believes in you you know what i mean that believes in you exactly that's also there's a concept of like let's say um salary uh personally i would feel bad if i have just fixed salary especially in those early stages so whoever joins join us right now like he has a huge impact what are we in the future and i wouldn't just stop on like this fixed salary i would literally go to the bonuses and so on because like if the guy trusts us right now believes in us and he's a part of the team right now then if we grow into like multimillion dollar company right like i would have no problem to sharing devs with those people because they were there first they believed in us so i would feel really bad just paying fixed um yeah do you want to get to the multimillion dollar agency i think it's i mean we'll be there at some point i just don't know when uh but this will happen i mean if we keep up what we do that's what i believe uh the long term game and that's why i don't want to quit at all it's that if you really do it like especially okay right now in the automotive industry what we see is like there's a huge barrier it's extremely hard to get in like there are those people who are building this software there are those companies who are getting this offer from them so it's literally those are close man but if they will be open just a little we get in man and we are there um that's what i believe so at some point of course uh i think i mean i know we will get there it will be very tough it will be very hard yeah harder than ever but i'm excited for it because also why i'm in this is that this is like you cannot predict what will happen even you won't there are some patterns you don't know who you will meet um that's why i'm also excited so you never know and i just and i kind of remember you remember you kind of when you first kind of left uh clever programmer right and you want to start your short separate agency like you were such a more of a beginner on the aspect of like a software agency right or like a business type aspect right and now like a few months later like you're you're this grownup guy i'm not saying i mean you you were grown up before as well right but like more growing up in the knowledge base and and in your focus probably in terms of what you want to do a 22 year old right it's still pretty crazy you want to build your own software agency you got clients at 22 years old i don't know what i was doing 22 year olds but i was not building software ages that's for sure you know granted i was still working hard of course right that was still me always always but i wasn't doing that so from my point of view you know you're doing you're doing an amazing job and you know i'm really excited for where you're gonna go kind of the next few years you know i'm really excited appreciate it we this other pot this podcast in the next year or so again and we're going to call it man i'm housing for it it's going to be a million dollars now at that point seven figures one figure mode but man what's funny is like when you do this uh when you let's say go back and you look at yourself for example one a year ago two years ago and man every time i do this i i'm like what a jerk like who the i thought i am man so literally future myself are you watching this i'm sorry but man i'm excited so yeah i mean look you know it's the best part when you get to grow like even for example for me you know i get to look at myself you know when i've done i i watched recently the the the first video i did for clever programmer right i was like this innocent guy i was like hey guys you know how are you guys doing hope homeball is great you know you know and i just like i'm like i'm looking myself i'm like holy who is this guy you know and i remember the first time that they kazzy and the team they took me out to what's it called to um santa monica here and they put me on the spot and just said hey we'll film you it's called the the video is called seven years and seven minutes and i remember that was so yeah i saw it i was so scared i was my pants like you know i was so scared to be talking in front of so many people but now i get to do this every day now if i go to santa monica and i have to shoot a video it's like a piece of cake i'm like let's roll you know i'm gonna tell you even the video you recorded the seven years in seven minutes i watched that and at this point i was literally watching it and back in poland because i discovered a clever programmer like literally like i know three years ago i was watching kazzyman then i saw you as like man those those guys are so cool they know so much i wanna work with them one day and then i grew the instagram at some point i texted qazi man it just happened right it just happened you think about it every single day and you really want it but i believe that it will happen but you really need to work on that you just need to work on it you just need to work on it those of you who think you know i tell i tell this to a lot of students because i get to speak to a lot of students now at this point right it's very simple is that there's two types of people in this world there's the types of people who talk about what they want to be they talk about the goals i want to do this i want to do this i want to do that but they do nothing about it because you know how the human brain works it's like whenever you talk about something your brain feels like you're like you already feel good your brain kind of feels like you already accomplished that so you don't do anything about that so i really usually i don't even talk about stuff that's why i'm not also like on instagram anymore because it's like i really focus on the work right now we really focus on taking the action not really sharing about that that it's totally different when i was sharing a lot of stuff on instagram at some point i was literally automating this that i was resharing the same post i just felt good i felt productive but it was like all fake productivity it was it wasn't bringing any results in the end so also be careful when talking but also i hate myself when i talk about something and i won't do it that's another thing right i talk about something then people are telling me about something like what i said and i just need to do it so it can works in different ways depends on your personality again it's so funny for the for day he's like how do i join the team like domain is mechanic and software dev what's too much to enjoy trying to join the selfmade team we're trying to join the clever programmer team but yeah for those of you guys who do who are interested for example and you know getting
