00:00 - hey you what's up this is Kazi from
00:02 - clever programmer calm so for the last
00:05 - few days I have been at chest state
00:07 - championships coaching the announced
00:09 - North High School chess team I used to
00:11 - play on that chess team in 2000 2009 to
00:15 - 2012 and I ended up winning two state
00:18 - championships during my high school
00:19 - career but I wanted to now kind of
00:23 - return the favor and coach the team
00:24 - because that's something I absolutely
00:26 - love to do and absolutely love to play
00:28 - chess so this video is gonna be a little
00:31 - bit about chess so let's jump right into
00:35 - it
00:41 - so to keep it relevant for you guys I'm
00:43 - gonna start off with one of my students
00:45 - asking me a computer science question
00:47 - that's related to high school and then
00:51 - transitioning over to a career so I'm
00:55 - gonna have him ask me that question and
00:56 - then I'm gonna answer it because I want
00:58 - to keep this relevant to you guys as
01:00 - well here we go my question is in order
01:02 - I am a high school student and in order
01:05 - for me to get a head start in the field
01:08 - of Technology and computer science I was
01:10 - wondering what I could do to get ahead
01:14 - in the field and learn the technical
01:16 - skills needed to get a job or an
01:19 - internship at a company how would I
01:22 - would actually answer that question is
01:24 - that work on soft skills more than you
01:27 - actually work on technical skills so yes
01:29 - improve your technical skills focus on
01:32 - them but I want you to work really hard
01:35 - on your negotiation skills and your
01:38 - tactical skills in your interviewing
01:39 - skills a lot of software developers just
01:41 - hope and pray that if they are good
01:44 - enough good jobs will just land on them
01:46 - and that doesn't happen and that doesn't
01:48 - happen with standardized testing either
01:49 - a CTS
01:51 - how do you score well on your high
01:52 - school a CT which is the standard test
01:56 - that you get in junior year of high
01:58 - school is
02:00 - you start actually taking literally the
02:02 - test and get good at taking the test
02:04 - so with getting a better job you have to
02:08 - get good at actually looking for jobs
02:10 - and interviewing for the jobs so that
02:12 - would be my answer work on soft skills
02:14 - work a lot on negotiation skills all
02:19 - right let me give you a little bit of a
02:21 - backstory here the the chess tournament
02:23 - that we had which was going to the state
02:25 - chess championships we kind of left on
02:28 - Thursday like really early in the
02:31 - morning like 6 7 a.m. and then we got on
02:43 - the van and then we'd roll like I was
02:46 - driving the team and then my other coach
02:48 - was there too and we got in we settled
02:51 - in around on Thursday yes and the
03:04 - tournament is a two-day tournament so
03:05 - the tournament took place on Friday and
03:07 - then the tournament also took place on
03:09 - Saturday so it's a two-day tournament
03:11 - there are seven total rounds and there
03:14 - were a hundred and forty nine teams
03:16 - there so depending on how how many games
03:19 - you want that's how you kind of got your
03:21 - ranking so in the chess tournament on at
03:25 - the state championships level with
03:27 - schools how it works is there's a eight
03:28 - board team so eight of your people
03:30 - announce north to go around playing
03:32 - against other eight player teams and if
03:34 - the noun or team members wins then you
03:37 - know that that makes us go to the next
03:39 - round with a good result our ultimate
03:42 - score at the end was five wins and two
03:45 - losses which puts us as the 27th best
03:49 - team in the entire state which you know
03:53 - may be good for some teams but for now
03:56 - north historically we haven't done like
04:00 - this in the last 20 years we have scored
04:02 - higher but our team did actually a lot
04:07 - better than we had expected because we
04:09 - have lots of new players who are
04:11 - inexperienced and
04:12 - these guys these students these kids are
04:16 - crazy like as a team they pulled through
04:18 - they were doing really well they were
04:19 - taking so many teams asses like out of
04:21 - nowhere we were thinking that we're
04:23 - gonna get only three wins or four wins
04:24 - and I'm gonna show you a little bit in
04:27 - the snapchat stories with you - the
04:29 - quality is not that good but I think
04:31 - that you're gonna watch it and you
04:34 - you'll enjoy it and if you enjoyed it
04:36 - you know just comment below okay that
04:38 - was pretty cool and also like the video
04:40 - because I want to make sure that this
04:42 - video gets out to more people because
04:44 - remember the notification systems of the
04:46 - YouTube are completely like kind of
04:48 - broken right now so these videos aren't
04:49 - going out to everybody like they're
04:51 - supposed to and when you do that it
04:53 - makes sure that it gets ranked higher
04:55 - and so more people are likely to see
04:57 - especially you know people like you
04:59 - we're watching this video right now as a
05:01 - matter of fact so let's do that in the
05:04 - video and that I'm gonna share with you
05:05 - you're gonna be seeing me play some
05:07 - chess and I'm gonna be playing with some
05:10 - of my students I'm gonna be playing with
05:11 - my former coach his name was Harry Caray
05:14 - Oz's and I learned a lot from them and
05:17 - honestly a lot of the skills that I've
05:19 - learned from chests have translated into
05:22 - my coding a problem-solving skills
05:25 - high like levels of patience and then
05:29 - being able to analyze positions because
05:32 - in chess you have to analyze each
05:34 - position and you have to calculate out
05:36 - moves that are kind of very deep so I
05:39 - hate when people make and random
05:41 - analogies and connected to chess I ask
05:43 - it's so annoying for me they like
05:45 - connect anything to chests oh it's just
05:47 - like chess
05:47 - oh you're just making the next move but
05:51 - you know in certain respects I think
05:54 - it's okay and here I think I can make
05:56 - that analogy because for me
05:58 - chess did help me become the person I am
06:01 - today honestly I wasn't a very good
06:04 - student my whole life in school and so
06:08 - becoming good at chess becoming top 1%
06:10 - in the world you know just by playing on
06:13 - high school team and then you know just
06:14 - doing a lot on my own like studying and
06:17 - working hard every day it allowed me to
06:19 - get skilled at something
06:23 - and then I attack it and then that
06:27 - translated into spilled over into other
06:30 - things like coding and programming so
06:31 - for you guys if you are doing something
06:34 - else like another sport you know don't
06:36 - just wait it to get into programming
06:37 - like keep up with other skill because
06:48 - you'll be surprised how many other
06:50 - things from your different skill set
06:52 - even if it's table tennis or pool or
06:55 - swimming or whatever else will transfer
06:58 - over into coding like a lot of
07:10 - sportsmanship I had in a lot of like
07:13 - this insane ability that had developed
07:16 - to never ever ever give up and just like
07:19 - if I was stuck on a chess puzzle I would
07:21 - be stuck on it for weeks I would not
07:23 - look at the answer and then for me
07:25 - encoding what that meant was I would be
07:26 - stuck on a coding problem for weeks and
07:28 - I would not look at an answer and also
07:30 - not quit because 99% of the people when
07:33 - they can't find an answer they quit and
07:44 - I would just keep going and keep on
07:46 - learning you think so I would recommend
07:48 - you have different skill sets and you'll
07:52 - be surprised by how much they'll help
07:54 - you also I want to take this moment to
07:58 - just quickly talk about depth of versus
08:00 - breadth okay or with focus on being
08:05 - depth first and everything in computer
08:07 - programming there is an algorithm for
08:08 - search and it's called depth-first
08:10 - search and I am a huge fan of that and I
08:12 - think you should live your life like
08:14 - that as well
08:15 - and what that means is instead of going
08:18 - inch wide you know for a mile you should
08:23 - go a mile deep and an inch wide okay so
08:26 - instead of learning 20 different
08:28 - languages and learning like little bit
08:30 - of every different language learn one
08:32 - language and learn it
08:33 - damn well learn all the concepts and
08:36 - everything involved inside of it hey
08:39 - Eric
08:39 - did you win against me guys seriously
08:47 - joking aside I want to give a big
08:49 - shout-out to Eric I've been working with
08:51 - Eric since he was in seventh grade and
08:53 - right now he's a junior in high school
08:55 - which puts him at 12th grade so our 11th
08:58 - grade she means he's been I've been
09:00 - coaching him for five years he's been
09:02 - able to do some tremendous things and I
09:05 - was incredibly proud of him at this
09:07 - tournament especially what he was able
09:09 - to accomplish the next part of the story
09:11 - is kind of dedicated to Eric so I really
09:14 - want you guys to watch this and also
09:16 - just you know give if you can give him a
09:18 - little appreciation in the comments
09:20 - below I'll show him and I'm sure it'll
09:21 - make his day okay guys this is the game
09:24 - break around the last round there's only
09:28 - one person playing on our team
09:30 - if he wins our team win explanation eric
09:34 - is playing this is the last round
09:36 - if he wins our team wins if he draws our
09:37 - team draws and if he loses our team
09:39 - loses this is super dramatic we are
09:42 - about to walk in right now
09:49 - [Music]
09:53 - so tournament rooms are dead quiet so
09:56 - what I'm gonna try to do is provide a
09:58 - little commentary here for you guys so
10:00 - here you're watching that Eric needs to
10:03 - win this round the other seven members
10:05 - on our team at Niles North some of them
10:08 - lost some of them want but ultimately it
10:10 - came down to Eric
10:11 - in chess you can either win by your
10:13 - clock hitting zero or you lose if your
10:16 - clock hits zero or you can checkmate the
10:19 - other person so that's how it works in
10:20 - real professional chess tournaments so
10:23 - Eric is kind of thinking here and he's
10:25 - trying to win he has a much better
10:27 - position also I forgot to mention that
10:29 - he's playing on board one which is the
10:32 - most difficult board to play on board
10:34 - eight is the lowest rated and board one
10:37 - is two highest rated and he had about
10:40 - twenty or thirty people crowded around
10:42 - him watching his game near the end so he
10:44 - has a tremendous amount of pressure here
10:46 - but ultimately Eric was able to break
10:49 - through and win the game like this was a
10:52 - tremendous moment for nows north and it
10:54 - was able to pull Niles north through to
10:56 - the next round and then play in the
10:59 - final round so ultimately our team ended
11:01 - up doing well everybody played well
11:03 - together I was extremely proud of
11:05 - everybody and here just some goofs and
11:06 - gaps for you guys to enjoy because we
11:08 - are just
11:15 - [Music]
11:32 - what feature does Android have that
11:34 - iPhone doesn't give us an example that's
11:38 - right for a sport or for another hobby
11:44 - that you have get really good at one
11:47 - thing and then move on to different
11:48 - things like become really deeply skilled
11:51 - because nobody cares about just these
11:54 - generalists like people want to work
11:56 - with specialists so I would highly
11:58 - recommend becoming a specialist and kind
12:00 - of everything that you get yourself into
12:02 - like really get a deep knowledge of it
12:05 - and then you can take a step back and
12:07 - then try to develop some soft skills
12:08 - around it for me what that meant was
12:11 - getting programming skills and then
12:13 - working on my negotiation and soft
12:14 - skills thank you guys for watching so
12:16 - much if you like the video please hit
12:18 - that like button subscribe to the
12:20 - channel and go ahead check out some of
12:23 - my other videos that should be popping
12:24 - up somewhere soon I love you guys thank
12:28 - you guys for watching the channel all
12:30 - your support we're up to 17 thousand
12:31 - subscribers which is just absolutely
12:33 - amazing I don't know how else to say and
12:35 - can't wait to get to 20,000 I might have
12:37 - a special video for you guys in that
12:39 - case okay guys thank you love you I'll
12:42 - see you in the next

Cleaned transcript:

hey you what's up this is Kazi from clever programmer calm so for the last few days I have been at chest state championships coaching the announced North High School chess team I used to play on that chess team in 2000 2009 to 2012 and I ended up winning two state championships during my high school career but I wanted to now kind of return the favor and coach the team because that's something I absolutely love to do and absolutely love to play chess so this video is gonna be a little bit about chess so let's jump right into it so to keep it relevant for you guys I'm gonna start off with one of my students asking me a computer science question that's related to high school and then transitioning over to a career so I'm gonna have him ask me that question and then I'm gonna answer it because I want to keep this relevant to you guys as well here we go my question is in order I am a high school student and in order for me to get a head start in the field of Technology and computer science I was wondering what I could do to get ahead in the field and learn the technical skills needed to get a job or an internship at a company how would I would actually answer that question is that work on soft skills more than you actually work on technical skills so yes improve your technical skills focus on them but I want you to work really hard on your negotiation skills and your tactical skills in your interviewing skills a lot of software developers just hope and pray that if they are good enough good jobs will just land on them and that doesn't happen and that doesn't happen with standardized testing either a CTS how do you score well on your high school a CT which is the standard test that you get in junior year of high school is you start actually taking literally the test and get good at taking the test so with getting a better job you have to get good at actually looking for jobs and interviewing for the jobs so that would be my answer work on soft skills work a lot on negotiation skills all right let me give you a little bit of a backstory here the the chess tournament that we had which was going to the state chess championships we kind of left on Thursday like really early in the morning like 6 7 a.m. and then we got on the van and then we'd roll like I was driving the team and then my other coach was there too and we got in we settled in
