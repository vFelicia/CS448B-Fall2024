00:00 - hey guys so in the last video I
00:02 - mentioned we're gonna do fine length of
00:03 - string but what's better for you guys is
00:06 - if we do another problem that's pretty
00:08 - similar so you you guys can test out
00:10 - your own skills as well just in case you
00:12 - got stuck on the even number problem
00:15 - right so let's see if you can write code
00:17 - that can give you an answer for the
00:21 - if it's the number is odd okay so this
00:24 - problem is called check for odd numbers
00:26 - alright so here I have write a function
00:29 - is odd that takes in a number and
00:32 - returns true if it's odd otherwise false
00:34 - so it's pretty much the opposite of
00:36 - finding an even number solution
00:39 - so with the even number problem if I
00:42 - gave you two it should return false
00:44 - right
00:46 - Iram sorry should return true but for
00:48 - them
00:49 - oops so real loud so
00:53 - same thing should happen for this one
00:55 - except when I give you three it should
00:57 - say true otherwise false now I'm going
01:00 - to go over the solution this problem
01:02 - just in case you haven't tried this on
01:04 - your own the link is below to the
01:06 - problem and to the solution so if you're
01:08 - on watching this on YouTube go ahead and
01:09 - try it on your own if you're on my
01:11 - website clever programmer calm
01:13 - everything should be a-okay anyways then
01:15 - so let's get started I have some
01:18 - function it's called is odd that's the
01:21 - first step to get correct and you can
01:24 - check how it works you at the bottom so
01:25 - again you can just go ahead and kind of
01:27 - cheat you see the function is called odd
01:30 - it takes in one input so you can kind of
01:32 - go like okay is odd hmm my input is
01:37 - some number and what can I do if that
01:41 - number what does it mean for a number to
01:43 - be odd right what does it mean for a
01:45 - number to be an odd number well all it
01:48 - means is that it's not divisible by two
01:50 - right so for example if I gave you 12
01:55 - right is it divisible by two yes it is
01:59 - you get back true but if what if I give
02:01 - you 13 is that divisible by two no
02:03 - because 2 goes all the 12 and then
02:05 - there's a one spillover or remainder so
02:09 - here you have false but we just want to
02:12 - flip the results
02:13 - meaning this should give you false and
02:15 - this should give you true for the
02:17 - solution to this problem so let's go if
02:19 - number
02:21 - divisible by 2 is not equal to 0 then I
02:25 - want to say give me true otherwise give
02:29 - me false
02:30 - ok let's check if the solution work so
02:33 - i'm going to uncomment this part and
02:35 - let's go and run it and it says your
02:38 - code is correct so that's good let's try
02:40 - giving it you know is odd let's try
02:44 - giving it to 3
02:46 - it says true and what if I give it to it
02:50 - should say false ok cool and now if you
02:54 - want to try the bonus challenge on your
02:56 - own pause the video go try it otherwise
02:58 - I'm going to go over the answer right
03:00 - now so here's the bonus way of doing it
03:06 - return number
03:11 - divisible by or mod 2 does not give you
03:15 - the remainder 0 ok so it's like the
03:18 - opposite of the even number function so
03:21 - there you go that's your one-liner right
03:23 - you're cheeky one-liner
03:26 - ok guys that's it for this video I'll
03:28 - see you in the next video

hey guys so in the last video I mentioned we're gonna do fine length of string but what's better for you guys is if we do another problem that's pretty similar so you you guys can test out your own skills as well just in case you got stuck on the even number problem right so let's see if you can write code that can give you an answer for the if it's the number is odd okay so this problem is called check for odd numbers alright so here I have write a function is odd that takes in a number and returns true if it's odd otherwise false so it's pretty much the opposite of finding an even number solution so with the even number problem if I gave you two it should return false right Iram sorry should return true but for them oops so real loud so same thing should happen for this one except when I give you three it should say true otherwise false now I'm going to go over the solution this problem just in case you haven't tried this on your own the link is below to the problem and to the solution so if you're on watching this on YouTube go ahead and try it on your own if you're on my website clever programmer calm everything should be aokay anyways then so let's get started I have some function it's called is odd that's the first step to get correct and you can check how it works you at the bottom so again you can just go ahead and kind of cheat you see the function is called odd it takes in one input so you can kind of go like okay is odd hmm my input is some number and what can I do if that number what does it mean for a number to be odd right what does it mean for a number to be an odd number well all it means is that it's not divisible by two right so for example if I gave you 12 right is it divisible by two yes it is you get back true but if what if I give you 13 is that divisible by two no because 2 goes all the 12 and then there's a one spillover or remainder so here you have false but we just want to flip the results meaning this should give you false and this should give you true for the solution to this problem so let's go if number divisible by 2 is not equal to 0 then I want to say give me true otherwise give me false ok let's check if the solution work so i'm going to uncomment this part and let's go and run it and it says your code is correct so that's good let's try giving it you know is odd let's try giving it to 3 it says true and what if I give it to it should say false ok cool and now if you want to try the bonus challenge on your own pause the video go try it otherwise I'm going to go over the answer right now so here's the bonus way of doing it return number divisible by or mod 2 does not give you the remainder 0 ok so it's like the opposite of the even number function so there you go that's your oneliner right you're cheeky oneliner ok guys that's it for this video I'll see you in the next video
