00:40 - interfacing with each other
00:41 - live you're going to have chance to do a
00:43 - q a nas and i were sitting down and we
00:45 - thought hey
00:46 - let's build this event we were actually
00:48 - literally at a park just a few minutes
00:50 - ago and we thought
00:51 - how about let's make a workshop that
00:53 - gives you
00:54 - massive value so we decided to book a
00:57 - full three-day
00:58 - event where we build these epic projects
01:01 - put them on your portfolio and in the
01:03 - past a lot of our students have actually
01:04 - gotten jobs
01:05 - just by having these on their portfolios
01:08 - exactly exactly and so you
01:09 - if you think about it it's an immersive
01:11 - experience live event just like kazu
01:13 - said
01:13 - fully unzoomed so not only do we get to
01:16 - fully see your face which is going to be
01:18 - amazing and you get to see our face
01:20 - but also what do they get to do quasi
01:22 - they also get to ask questions
01:24 - that's right so you get to talk with us
01:25 - now on day one what's important
01:28 - for you to know is you're going to be
01:30 - learning the opportunity that exists for
01:32 - developers
01:32 - in 2021 and how the lockdowns has
01:36 - affected it or not and then on day one
01:39 - what else are we going to do we're also
01:40 - going to be building the part one of the
01:43 - amazon clones so
01:44 - in day one it's if you're for seven
01:45 - hours pretty much straight here the
01:47 - first
01:47 - three hours is just what kaza said is
01:49 - the opportunity to become a developer
01:51 - and then you'll get a break and then
01:52 - right away we'll get into building our
01:55 - epic project
01:56 - and for day two day two we're going to
01:57 - be working on the amazon project
02:00 - as well as we're going to build out your
02:03 - portfolio
02:04 - so we can actually put your amazon
02:06 - project inside of that portfolio
02:08 - that's going to be sick and again also
02:10 - about seven hours of the whole day

02:38 - we going to be doing
02:39 - we're going to be actually doing a few
02:41 - cool things
02:42 - one is you're going to be learning how
02:43 - this one developer
02:45 - we won't tell you who it is made over
02:47 - 300 000
02:48 - in actually under three years with
02:50 - javascript we're actually going to be
02:52 - launching our clever programmer online
02:55 - coding boot camp
02:57 - let's go this is a 12 month online
02:59 - coding bootcamp
03:00 - with four immersive retreats this is
03:03 - absolutely
03:04 - the first time we'll be launching this
03:06 - so you don't want to miss out on this
03:08 - and after that we're going to be
03:11 - bringing on some
03:12 - students who have gone on to absolutely
03:15 - crush it with javascript and
03:17 - you know i've landed tons of jobs yeah
03:19 - so you know
03:20 - students who have went from zero to
03:21 - fifty thousand dollars or students who
03:23 - went from
03:24 - forty to ninety six thousand dollars or
03:26 - students who went from 130 to 170
03:28 - 000 a year and the the amazing part is
03:31 - those students will actually
03:32 - be part of this challenge as well so
03:34 - you'll get to
03:36 - ask what them questions and maybe get
03:38 - some feedback
03:39 - or you know uh get some knowledge on
03:42 - what you
03:43 - as well need to do to be at that level
03:45 - too so don't miss out on this
03:47 - opportunity the students who
03:48 - join will be the first ones to know how
03:51 - the online coding bootcamp for clever
03:53 - programmer works
03:54 - we're so freaking excited oh yeah no
03:56 - idea that to you
03:57 - and share with you everything that we
03:59 - have put together
04:00 - and how much heart and soul and energy
04:02 - is going to go into this
04:04 - so massive massive value for you in
04:06 - those three days
04:07 - along with you being the first few
04:10 - people who actually get to see the
04:13 - online coding bootcamp and how that
04:14 - would work
04:15 - and the online workshop as we're doing
04:16 - right now yep yeah
04:18 - so this workshop also is going to be the
04:20 - first live workshop that we've ever done
04:23 - because up until now we've done it on
04:25 - facebook groups and facebook live or
04:27 - youtube
04:28 - live but the problem with that is
04:31 - it's all online and you can interact
04:33 - with us
04:34 - people talk with us in the comments
04:36 - people post
04:38 - you know notes or maybe we have a slack
04:40 - community
04:41 - but we've never had a face-to-face zoom
04:44 - collaboration where you can work with us
04:48 - you can also break off into groups and
04:50 - pair program yeah
04:51 - that is absolutely new and we definitely
04:53 - never had these intensive
04:55 - full six to eight hour day workshops
04:57 - where we just
04:58 - build out the entire thing together and
05:00 - i think the best part about this is the
05:02 - two-week communication because
05:04 - not only are we communicating to you but
05:06 - you get the chance to communicate to us
05:07 - directly over these coaching calls right
05:09 - so
05:10 - you get to ask any questions if you like
05:12 - really are stuck like oh nas or kazi i
05:14 - really can't do this or
05:15 - if we're all hyped up we get to go all
05:18 - high pop get hyped up together
05:19 - we all get to dance together as well and
05:22 - so it's gonna be very immersive amazing
05:23 - experience
05:24 - uh probably something you haven't seen
05:26 - before so make sure
