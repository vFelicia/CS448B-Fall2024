00:00 - hey guys what's up how's it going this
00:02 - is kazy from clever program.com and in
00:04 - this video I want to talk about one of
00:06 - the most important key characteristics
00:09 - between successful people and people or
00:14 - lazy people so in this video I'm going
00:17 - to talk about this and without any
00:18 - further Ado let's jump right into it
00:31 - [Applause]
00:34 - okay so one thing that I kind of want to
00:37 - drill down and this is one of those
00:38 - things that you will be able to take
00:40 - away right from this video and actually
00:42 - start applying it in your life um is
00:47 - this most people consume content and
00:51 - we're really good at consuming it you
00:53 - know we will sit there and watch Game of
00:55 - Thrones we will watch House of Cards we
00:58 - will watch online tutorials we'll go to
01:01 - websites like stackoverflow.com to get
01:03 - our programming questions answered or we
01:06 - will scour the internet we'll be on
01:09 - Reddit we'll go to YouTube watch videos
01:12 - but you'll but then you'll start to
01:13 - realize a
01:15 - pattern you'll like a you'll enjoy a
01:18 - video on YouTube but you won't find
01:19 - yourself actually hitting the Thumbs Up
01:21 - Button you'll want you'll you'll see an
01:24 - answer on Reddit but you won't see
01:26 - yourself uh adding a comment and adding
01:29 - to that that
01:30 - discussion you will see a video um on or
01:35 - or show on Netflix or whatever but you
01:37 - won't ever see yourself as part of the
01:40 - discussion so yeah you will see us you
01:44 - know we will do a lot of things that we
01:46 - enjoy but we won't actually be
01:48 - collaborating with the community and
01:50 - adding something of value to the world
01:52 - right now successful people on the other
01:56 - hand will add value to the world will
02:01 - add value to the community so one of the
02:05 - main things that I would want you to
02:06 - focus on is stop just sitting there and
02:10 - consuming things because you won't learn
02:14 - things as well everything that is um
02:17 - that you pick up those habits won't be a
02:20 - part of your lifestyle those will just
02:22 - be something that's very passive but
02:25 - when you teach this to others or it's
02:28 - one of those things that you collaborate
02:29 - with the community in right then it's
02:32 - something that will be ingrained in your
02:34 - head so here's what I mean let's say
02:37 - that you are learning something new why
02:40 - not blog about it or why not write about
02:44 - it and share it with your friends even
02:46 - if you don't want to share it online if
02:49 - you are picking up new skills or there
02:52 - are new things that you have coming in
02:54 - your head you know put it in a forum on
02:57 - a website like stack overflow.com
03:00 - on a website like
03:02 - reddit.com collaborate with the
03:04 - community the next time you see
03:06 - something that is
03:08 - thought-provoking you know put it leave
03:11 - a comment on it and I don't care if it's
03:13 - for my video even if it's something that
03:14 - you see on a website like github.com or
03:18 - again stack Overflow or Reddit you know
03:19 - those are the ones I'm I keep using
03:21 - because those are the ones that are
03:22 - coming through my head but start with
03:24 - small acts of contributing and creating
03:28 - and when you are creating things you're
03:30 - becoming that top 1% who is actually
03:33 - taking part in this world whereas the
03:36 - other 99% Mily consume it so even one of
03:40 - the key things that that that helped
03:41 - this channel grow is in the start it
03:44 - wasn't this awesome Channel with all of
03:47 - you guys there right it was just me and
03:52 - what the heck do I talk about I wasn't
03:54 - like professional content creator and
03:56 - all the all this stuff all I did was I
03:59 - learned learned about factorials and I
04:01 - was like cool I'm going to make a video
04:02 - about it and share it with the world I
04:04 - learned about some random stuff I wrote
04:06 - a Blog about it uh anything that I was
04:09 - kind of learning about you know or even
04:10 - when I was in college any new thing that
04:13 - I learned or thought could provide value
04:14 - to the world all I did was make a video
04:17 - on it so I didn't have to go oh I have
04:19 - to like be a professional content
04:21 - publisher just like let me just document
04:23 - what's going on in my life and maybe I
04:25 - can help other people and as long as I
04:27 - got one comment or two views or one like
04:30 - that was enough for me because that told
04:32 - me that somebody in some part of the
04:35 - world was finding this valuable now let
04:38 - me give you some other big giant
04:41 - benefits that come from this so let's
04:43 - say that you are learning computer
04:46 - programming right now you're a complete
04:48 - beginner what would be the benefits if
04:50 - you started writing about your journey
04:53 - one even if you're if you're a complete
04:55 - beginner right because sometimes we
04:56 - worry or we have to be an expert to
04:58 - write about it keep in mind I wasn't an
05:00 - expert when I was writing about these
05:02 - things so let's talk about some of the
05:04 - benefits let's say you start uh writing
05:07 - a Blog right or you start writing about
05:10 - this one of the things that's going to
05:12 - happen is you're going to become damn
05:14 - good at the subject because you're going
05:17 - to have to crystallize your thoughts to
05:18 - actually write it and then it's edged
05:21 - there forever so you can actually refer
05:23 - back to it okay one for you very
05:25 - beneficial another benefit if you go to
05:28 - apply to a job you can show them your
05:30 - resume which is cool you can show them
05:33 - your curriculum VTE you know your CV
05:36 - that's cool you can do an interview with
05:38 - them that's cool but hey how about check
05:40 - out my blog or even better yet how about
05:43 - if they say oh we have checked out your
05:45 - blog so that brings me to the third
05:47 - benefit of it which is people can find
05:50 - you people can recognize you and find
05:53 - you and be like hey I want to work with
05:55 - you you don't even actually have to go
05:57 - out and get to work people will come to
06:00 - you right they can come to you and in
06:03 - the other scenario where they don't find
06:05 - you at least it gives you something very
06:06 - powerful that when you show to people it
06:09 - gives you that giant Edge over everybody
06:11 - else right this is one of the things I
06:13 - want to talk about unfair advantages not
06:15 - unethical advantages but unfair
06:18 - advantages meaning that they give you a
06:20 - boost in life that other people miss out
06:23 - on right so you want to get as many
06:25 - unfair advantages that you can get but
06:28 - make sure that they're ethical obviously
06:29 - you know one of the other unfair
06:31 - advantages is waking up early but that's
06:33 - for another video in this video I just
06:34 - want to talk about get in that habit of
06:37 - creating now I also want to show you one
06:39 - of the students at clever programmer
06:41 - okay you see my channel you guys can go
06:43 - back to my older videos and see exactly
06:45 - what I was doing but I want to give you
06:47 - an example of somebody else uh so this
06:49 - is one of the students at clever
06:51 - programmer and I've actually been even
06:52 - working with him uh oneon-one a little
06:55 - bit but all like all of this stuff that
06:59 - I'm going to be showing you he pretty
07:00 - much did on his own okay so you can
07:02 - check this out his name is Dennis Dennis
07:05 - Murphy and um it's really cool what he's
07:08 - doing so for example okay we worked
07:10 - together oneon-one and we we built a
07:13 - basic flas Gap okay and I barely I
07:15 - showed him just a few things about how
07:18 - flask Works in Python then he went ahead
07:21 - and instead of just sitting there and
07:22 - watching tutorials all day right which
07:26 - is again what unfortunately most of us
07:28 - will do he went in there and he started
07:31 - building things okay so this didn't just
07:34 - happen in one day but you can see he put
07:36 - together this full website from you know
07:39 - from uh from pretty much scratch using
07:42 - uh a framework called flask using HTML
07:46 - and then using I I believe bootstrap and
07:48 - some uh one of the themes from bootstrap
07:51 - but all the technicality aside he is a
07:54 - beginner in Python he's getting better
07:57 - through just working at it but making
07:59 - sure that he's actually producing things
08:02 - and making things
08:06 - so this is one of the Prime examples of
08:09 - you actually working to produce content
08:11 - rather than just taking it okay um so
08:14 - you
08:15 - again all he did was he built this
08:18 - website and for the idea all he's like
08:20 - okay this is just going to be my uh you
08:23 - know my portfolio essentially so he
08:25 - built a portfolio he says he's a
08:26 - WordPress developer a python developer
08:28 - and he buil this using flask framework
08:31 - cool now another cool thing that I want
08:34 - to show you is that all throughout his
08:36 - journey right you can see he's just been
08:39 - blogging about it so focus on social
08:43 - media write a blog python apps behaving
08:46 - badly in flask so now he's so there's a
08:49 - there's a blog post about python suspend
08:52 - the filters I have no idea what
08:54 - the hell that's about but sounds pretty
08:56 - cool right he had an idea and he wrote a
08:59 - blog post about it a third way of living
09:01 - and then again you have deploy flask app
09:03 - to Heroku and this is really cool and I
09:06 - think a lot of you can actually benefit
09:08 - from it especially if you've uh you're
09:10 - in my oop course and you watched my
09:11 - flask video if you click on that blog
09:14 - post he talked about how he published
09:18 - that flask app you know
09:22 - so if nothing he might be able to get a
09:25 - junior developer job faster than most
09:28 - other people simply because he's writing
09:30 - up about it and those who hire him can
09:33 - see his passion for it and they're like
09:34 - this person is trainable and they can
09:36 - look at his consistency of him creating
09:39 - things and he doesn't just sit there and
09:41 - consume yeah and then also then he went
09:43 - ahead on medium.com and he's been
09:45 - blogging and he started recently I kind
09:48 - of pushed him to you know start medium
09:51 - but then I'm not pushing him anymore and
09:53 - he's doing it on his own he's
09:54 - consistently been blogging even on
09:56 - medium.com you can do the same things
09:59 - doesn't take rocket science you don't
10:01 - need a degree you don't need crazy
10:03 - levels of experience and you don't need
10:05 - to be an expert in any of this you can
10:07 - literally blog or write about or um make
10:11 - a video about what you're currently
10:14 - learning and maybe it'll resonate with
10:16 - somebody else maybe it will get you a
10:19 - higher paying job maybe it will make the
10:22 - convincing of you getting a job easier
10:24 - maybe people will recognize you and
10:26 - maybe like clever programmer you might
10:28 - actually be able to build your own
10:30 - business right and get a following of
10:33 - people who find what you're doing
10:35 - helpful so get out of the habit of just
10:38 - consuming start getting in the habit of
10:41 - creating and start small you can start
10:44 - by leaving comments in places and if you
10:47 - think something is bad dislike it
10:50 - instead of just walking away if you
10:52 - think something's good like it and again
10:54 - I'm not talking about my YouTube videos
10:56 - which but you can give it a like that
10:58 - would be awesome but I am talking about
11:00 - literally if you're on a post you're on
11:03 - a forum you are like on a random website
11:06 - and you read something you know just get
11:09 - out of that weird cycle of not doing
11:11 - anything I'll give you an example on
11:15 - GitHub um it's a website for
11:18 - developers made by developers um and I
11:23 - was stuck in this problem for one
11:25 - problem for a long time so I went on
11:27 - github.com and I went and deep into this
11:30 - one forum and like 30 threads down or
11:33 - whatever right 30 pages down in this
11:36 - thread I still didn't find um I still
11:39 - didn't find a solution there but finally
11:42 - I was able to figure it out so what I
11:43 - did is I went back to that thread wrote
11:45 - exactly how I found my solution and then
11:48 - you know I kind of left it I'm like
11:50 - whatever I'm just going to write down
11:51 - how I found it maybe it'll help somebody
11:53 - else few months later you know I got
11:56 - people who were thanking me they're like
11:57 - thank you Rafa Kazi that worked thank
12:00 - you this worked and here's the cool part
12:02 - two years later I got stuck when I was
12:05 - doing python development in the same
12:07 - problem but I had forgotten about this
12:09 - solution or anything I went back on
12:11 - github.com
12:13 - went to this thread was 30 pages deep in
12:16 - that thread just going bashing my head
12:18 - spent like 5 hours trying to figure out
12:20 - couldn't figure it out went and I saw
12:22 - some some people were saying thanks
12:24 - thanks and I'm like oh so maybe somebody
12:27 - found a solution that's why people are
12:28 - thinking let me go go to the person that
12:30 - they're thinking and guess who that
12:31 - person was it was me and I basically
12:35 - solved my problem two years before and
12:38 - it helped kazzy from the future so it
12:43 - can even help you right if not for
12:46 - anybody else but it's cool to help other
12:49 - people along with helping yourself all
12:52 - right so that's the message for this
12:55 - video stop consuming start creating
12:57 - that's one of the key differences
12:59 - between people who end up becoming
13:01 - successful versus the people who stay
13:04 - where they
13:05 - are again take control thank you for
13:09 - watching and as always I love you so
13:10 - much and I'll see you in the next video
13:14 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys what's up how's it going this is kazy from clever program.com and in this video I want to talk about one of the most important key characteristics between successful people and people or lazy people so in this video I'm going to talk about this and without any further Ado let's jump right into it okay so one thing that I kind of want to drill down and this is one of those things that you will be able to take away right from this video and actually start applying it in your life um is this most people consume content and we're really good at consuming it you know we will sit there and watch Game of Thrones we will watch House of Cards we will watch online tutorials we'll go to websites like stackoverflow.com to get our programming questions answered or we will scour the internet we'll be on Reddit we'll go to YouTube watch videos but you'll but then you'll start to realize a pattern you'll like a you'll enjoy a video on YouTube but you won't find yourself actually hitting the Thumbs Up Button you'll want you'll you'll see an answer on Reddit but you won't see yourself uh adding a comment and adding to that that discussion you will see a video um on or or show on Netflix or whatever but you won't ever see yourself as part of the discussion so yeah you will see us you know we will do a lot of things that we enjoy but we won't actually be collaborating with the community and adding something of value to the world right now successful people on the other hand will add value to the world will add value to the community so one of the main things that I would want you to focus on is stop just sitting there and consuming things because you won't learn things as well everything that is um that you pick up those habits won't be a part of your lifestyle those will just be something that's very passive but when you teach this to others or it's one of those things that you collaborate with the community in right then it's something that will be ingrained in your head so here's what I mean let's say that you are learning something new why not blog about it or why not write about it and share it with your friends even if you don't want to share it online if you are picking up new skills or there are new things that you have coming in your head you know put it in a forum on a website like stack overflow.com on a website like reddit.com collaborate with the community the next time you see something that is thoughtprovoking you know put it leave a comment on it and I don't care if it's for my video even if it's something that you see on a website like github.com or again stack Overflow or Reddit you know those are the ones I'm I keep using because those are the ones that are coming through my head but start with small acts of contributing and creating and when you are creating things you're becoming that top 1% who is actually taking part in this world whereas the other 99% Mily consume it so even one of the key things that that that helped this channel grow is in the start it wasn't this awesome Channel with all of you guys there right it was just me and what the heck do I talk about I wasn't like professional content creator and all the all this stuff all I did was I learned learned about factorials and I was like cool I'm going to make a video about it and share it with the world I learned about some random stuff I wrote a Blog about it uh anything that I was kind of learning about you know or even when I was in college any new thing that I learned or thought could provide value to the world all I did was make a video on it so I didn't have to go oh I have to like be a professional content publisher just like let me just document what's going on in my life and maybe I can help other people and as long as I got one comment or two views or one like that was enough for me because that told me that somebody in some part of the world was finding this valuable now let me give you some other big giant benefits that come from this so let's say that you are learning computer programming right now you're a complete beginner what would be the benefits if you started writing about your journey one even if you're if you're a complete beginner right because sometimes we worry or we have to be an expert to write about it keep in mind I wasn't an expert when I was writing about these things so let's talk about some of the benefits let's say you start uh writing a Blog right or you start writing about this one of the things that's going to happen is you're going to become damn good at the subject because you're going to have to crystallize your thoughts to actually write it and then it's edged there forever so you can actually refer back to it okay one for you very beneficial another benefit if you go to apply to a job you can show them your resume which is cool you can show them your curriculum VTE you know your CV that's cool you can do an interview with them that's cool but hey how about check out my blog or even better yet how about if they say oh we have checked out your blog so that brings me to the third benefit of it which is people can find you people can recognize you and find you and be like hey I want to work with you you don't even actually have to go out and get to work people will come to you right they can come to you and in the other scenario where they don't find you at least it gives you something very powerful that when you show to people it gives you that giant Edge over everybody else right this is one of the things I want to talk about unfair advantages not unethical

in the next video
