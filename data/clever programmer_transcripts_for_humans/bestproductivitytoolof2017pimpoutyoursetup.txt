00:00 - hey guys what's up this is kazy from
00:02 - clever program.com so up until now I
00:05 - have been teaching you guys about coding
00:08 - command lines python objectoriented
00:11 - stuff in Python and everything has been
00:14 - related to coding besides some Vlogs and
00:17 - life advice of course I love to give
00:19 - life advice but today I wanted to share
00:22 - something different with you guys what I
00:25 - thought would be really important for
00:26 - you guys is some productivity apps
00:30 - so that's what we're going to talk about
00:32 - in today's segment we are going to hone
00:35 - in on one particular productivity app
00:37 - and I think that this is by far the best
00:40 - productivity app of I don't know 2017
00:44 - and
00:46 - 2016 and probably the previous years as
00:49 - well however one disclaimer this is for
00:52 - Mac but if you see how the app works
00:56 - maybe you can get something very similar
00:57 - in Windows as well so we're going to
01:00 - talk about this and see how this app
01:02 - works so this app that I want to talk
01:04 - about today is called Alfred few things
01:08 - that are really awesome about Alfred
01:09 - that I think are already kind of built
01:11 - into Windows is the search functionality
01:13 - because while I like Spotlight of Max
01:17 - the annoying thing is that sometimes it
01:18 - comes in the way when I'm doing math or
01:21 - it's a little bit slow when it comes to
01:23 - finding things and it's not as
01:25 - intelligent but with Alfred it finds
01:27 - things very fast so for example if I
01:29 - want to find py chart P oh oh oops py
01:33 - and then it just comes up like it just
01:34 - comes up pretty much instantly like as
01:36 - soon as I hit p and then it starts to
01:39 - rank the apps based on how you use them
01:41 - so the more you use the app the quickly
01:44 - the quicker it would find it so if you
01:47 - use QuickTime Player all the time the
01:49 - next time you put Q it wouldn't put the
01:51 - qu quack app in front of you it would
01:54 - put the Quick Time app in front of you
01:56 - so same thing with my software that I
01:58 - use for coding is called pie charm now
02:02 - while this is great A few other things
02:04 - that are really important about this is
02:06 - because it doesn't look for all the
02:08 - things at the same time like your
02:09 - folders and your files instead it'll
02:12 - just by default look for apps that's its
02:15 - Secret Sauce that's what makes it so
02:17 - fast now if you want to look for a file
02:19 - or a folder just simply um type in F
02:23 - before and then after that type in what
02:25 - you're looking for so now you can search
02:26 - up contacts or you could search up
02:28 - folders like Doc doents or downloads and
02:32 - it does a very fast job of finding those
02:35 - as well plus it can do a ton more but
02:39 - the cool feature about this is the my
02:41 - favorite feature about this is something
02:43 - called the clipboard now when you copy
02:47 - things around the internet you want to
02:48 - be able to paste them at some point but
02:51 - what happens when you copy two things
02:53 - can you go back and paste that first
02:55 - thing that you had initially
02:57 - copied not really so what do you have
02:59 - have to do you have to go back get that
03:01 - thing and then paste it now maybe you
03:04 - have a clipboard manager great however
03:08 - what if you need to go back and I mean
03:11 - really back in time to pull out
03:12 - something so let me give you a very
03:14 - quick
03:15 - example my website right it's called
03:17 - clever program.com and if you see my
03:20 - theme and you see that orange color at
03:22 - the top that's a specific color that's
03:25 - the Branded color of the website so I
03:28 - need to use this color when I'm making
03:31 - new kind of Graphics or new kind of um I
03:35 - don't know web page templates or
03:37 - whatever I need to keep the brand
03:40 - consistent there is something called a
03:41 - hex code for each color it's essentially
03:43 - a six-digit code that uniquely
03:46 - identifies any particular color well I'm
03:49 - not going to waste my time trying to
03:51 - memorize that so instead I use my
03:53 - clipboard to kind of save that
03:55 - information for me and then later I can
03:57 - retrieve it at any point let me give you
03:58 - an example so I pop open my clipboard
04:01 - and it has all my previous things right
04:04 - in here so you can see for example it
04:07 - has my links and you can see that if
04:09 - it's a chrome link it has a Chrome icon
04:11 - right there and if it's a zoom link it
04:14 - has a zoom icon right there it's
04:16 - searchable you can navigate through it
04:18 - but more importantly it has its own
04:20 - search functionality up at the top so
04:21 - now if I type in let's say I'm looking
04:24 - for my color code right let me open up
04:26 - my uh let's see Color Picker app
04:30 - and maybe I'll go Color Picker and then
04:33 - in here if I want to put that code and
04:34 - get that orange I'll open up my
04:36 - clipboard and I will simply
04:38 - do actually let's type it into the
04:41 - search bar hashtag and you can see that
04:43 - it came up okay and if I type in F and
04:46 - then it comes up again so there it is
04:48 - that's my color let's go to prove that
04:51 - that's the color that we were looking
04:52 - for and I will simply go back to my
04:54 - Color Picker extension on my Chrome and
04:58 - if I put that color in m the hashtag
05:00 - symbol at the end you can you can see
05:02 - that it gives me that same exact orange
05:05 - nothing different so that's just one
05:07 - example of it another example of it uh
05:10 - another reason why I use it a lot is for
05:13 - uh pasting things that I need to use
05:16 - repeatedly so it could be an email
05:18 - template but for me one thing that I
05:21 - need to paste pretty like kind of like
05:24 - all the time is this so let me give you
05:26 - an example let's go to stack edit.
05:29 - this is like my handy text editor that I
05:32 - use from time to time because I think
05:35 - Word document kind of looks ugly and I
05:37 - don't like to even in Max Word documents
05:39 - I don't like to write in there I I use
05:41 - my own kind of things so if I go in here
05:45 - um and I kind of let's let's just delete
05:48 - all this for now
05:52 - okay if I do this equal equal equal
05:54 - thing my all my safe stuff for my
05:58 - YouTube comes and so then I just put
06:01 - that into my YouTube Channel's
06:02 - description right away so if you
06:04 - actually look at my description that's
06:06 - how I do it instead of having to save it
06:09 - somewhere particular or then have to go
06:11 - look it up later I don't have to do that
06:13 - my clipboard manager does that and the
06:16 - shortcut to that is uh command shift V
06:20 - and I think you can get something
06:22 - similar like that on Windows but what
06:24 - you're looking for what you need to
06:25 - search up if you're on Windows is
06:27 - something called a clipboard manager but
06:28 - if you on a map
06:30 - you should have Alfred it's faster than
06:32 - Spotlight it's better and again it
06:34 - allows you to do math without kind of
06:37 - opening it up all the way and blocking
06:39 - your view so that is another very cool
06:42 - reason for it and then there are some
06:45 - crazy things you can do you can create
06:47 - workflows you can create Snippets that
06:49 - automatically expand so other few
06:52 - benefits I love about this Alfred app
06:56 - that just are so amazing so let's say
06:59 - that you go to your video right and
07:01 - you're trying to respond to a hate
07:02 - comment no I'm kidding you're just
07:04 - trying to respond to somebody's comment
07:06 - right and you just click like let's say
07:08 - reply so many times you're trying to
07:11 - write something and then what happens
07:14 - like you try to reply or something
07:16 - breaks and you refresh and then
07:18 - everything is lost so you wrote this
07:20 - whole like reply to this person but
07:24 - everything is lost because of some
07:26 - stupid refresh or whatever so one thing
07:28 - I like to do which is practically like
07:30 - essentially how I'm I save things is I
07:33 - just go command a command C command a
07:35 - command C like as I'm writing things
07:38 - I'll just do command a command C and
07:40 - then just keep writing okay so what's
07:42 - the point of that well check it out it's
07:44 - in my clipboard forever and that way I
07:47 - never lose
07:48 - anything so the so this ends up being
07:52 - very handy because trust me so many
07:53 - times you'll be in a forum or you'll be
07:55 - somewhere you'll write stuff like even
07:57 - emails sometimes and you'll just lose
08:00 - but this is essentially a way of just
08:01 - copying things that you won't lose like
08:03 - for example this person says not to be
08:05 - nitpicky but English is relatively hard
08:07 - to learn well that's a good point uh
08:09 - maybe let me just copy that and maybe
08:11 - let me just uh copy something else and
08:13 - so later when I go somewhere outside of
08:16 - here I have everything so that's
08:18 - essentially my way of just going crazy
08:20 - and just saving whatever I need and then
08:22 - later on whenever I need to use it I'll
08:24 - have it forever and more importantly
08:25 - it's searchable so I can be like oh I
08:28 - can't find it but what if it was like
08:30 - not to be
08:31 - nitpicky right so it seriously just
08:35 - improves your workflow and it's so
08:37 - useful for coding cuz uh you have those
08:40 - beautiful on liners or you have that be
08:43 - beautiful piece of code that's working
08:45 - and that's doing everything but you want
08:46 - to not change a few things about it and
08:48 - add new things but you're not sure if
08:50 - it's going to break everything that
08:51 - was what you had done in the past so if
08:55 - you keep copying as you go and if you
08:58 - even change something thing now you can
09:00 - just always have whatever data that you
09:04 - need so those are a few key things I
09:08 - constantly use it for in my
09:11 - day-to-day
09:13 - stuff that is probably the most
09:16 - productive app SLS software and I wanted
09:20 - to tell you guys about it so then you
09:22 - can use it and increase your speed and
09:24 - especially if you're coding all the time
09:26 - you have to copy like two or three
09:28 - different things you don't want to lose
09:29 - it you want to keep track of it so then
09:31 - you can just go to the next place and
09:33 - copy paste them and have a history of
09:35 - what you've copied pasted this app
09:38 - Alfred goes back three months of time
09:42 - okay so if I showed you how I set it up
09:44 - so if you get this app you can set it up
09:46 - the same way okay so if you open up
09:47 - Alfred I've saved my command space thing
09:50 - to open up my Alfred
09:53 - menu uh for searching and in the
09:55 - features you can see it has a ton of
09:57 - features right like um one password
10:00 - system terminal shell the common one I
10:03 - use are is calculator and probably
10:07 - clipboard I don't even use contacts that
10:09 - much but in here what I've saved the
10:13 - hotkey to instead of doing command V to
10:15 - paste I just did command shift V and
10:18 - that's one more modifier key but then it
10:21 - opens up my entire clipboard and then I
10:23 - just go through what I need and I go
10:25 - ahead and paste it I set it to save 3
10:28 - months thing
10:30 - and then it just saves them so you can
10:33 - be doing things for a very long time and
10:35 - then have this like save things for you
10:37 - from the past and it
10:40 - just not having this is a huge pain in
10:43 - the ass I cannot imagine going back to
10:45 - that time when I didn't have this so
10:47 - honestly uh the reason why I was
10:50 - inspired to make this video was because
10:52 - I got to use my brother's MacBook Pro
10:54 - and while it was a lot better than
10:57 - mine I felt just
11:00 - so restricted I couldn't get anything
11:02 - done at least at the speed that I am
11:04 - used to getting things done and simply
11:06 - by not having this clipboard and Alfred
11:09 - so that's it for this video hopefully
11:12 - this will help you find a good clipboard
11:14 - manager improve your productivity
11:17 - improve your workflow and therefore your
11:19 - thought process and your coding skills
11:22 - and all of that stuff all right guys
11:24 - that's it for this video love you guys
11:26 - so much and I'll see you in the next
11:28 - video
