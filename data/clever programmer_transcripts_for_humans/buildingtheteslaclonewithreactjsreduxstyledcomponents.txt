02:48 - let's go ahead and get this party
02:50 - started to build something like this
02:52 - will of course require a few different
02:54 - things right uh we just start up
02:56 - with first is the react redux uh
02:58 - application right
03:00 - this is the code as you can see um
03:02 - nothing crazy we have the homepage the
03:03 - header page the section page
03:05 - this is our goal in terms of where we
03:06 - need to get to um
03:08 - but for now a few things let's go to
03:10 - about finder right now
03:11 - right uh if you're on windows of course
03:13 - it's gonna be for you
03:14 - it's gonna be a different situation um
03:17 - just open up your what is it called my
03:18 - computer whatever it has to be
03:20 - and let's go ahead and create a new
03:21 - folder i'm going to open up a new folder
03:24 - inside where
03:25 - well inside pretty much something called
03:28 - a terminal
03:29 - hopefully you guys can have that it's at
03:31 - the terminal right there beautiful
03:33 - and i'm going to zoom in so you can see
03:36 - much better
03:37 - okay all right and let's go ahead and do
03:40 - the following thing
03:41 - for this you of course need node.js
03:44 - right so hopefully you installed that if
03:46 - you have not installed that install
03:47 - node.js
03:48 - on your computer and everything will be
03:50 - good from there all right
03:52 - um so we'll do npx create dash
03:55 - dash react dash app we'll give them a
03:58 - react the name so let's go ahead and do
04:00 - tesla clone task clone beautiful
04:03 - and we'll do template and redux
04:07 - is the name of the template right right
04:09 - there hit enter
04:10 - there we go it's kind of compiled it's
04:12 - gonna do all necessary things it needs
04:13 - to do
04:14 - it's gonna work it's gonna go this and
04:20 - okay anyways i'm just you know
04:23 - passing time as it's kind of loading so
04:25 - as you can see it's creating the initial
04:27 - repository that you need
04:29 - right for for what well for basically
04:32 - for um your application okay that's what
04:35 - it
04:35 - specifically needs somebody said hi my
04:39 - name is tesla
04:39 - that's funny happy hacking is what we
04:43 - currently have happy hacking
04:45 - beautiful it's exactly what we need to
04:46 - get to right that means our application
04:48 - has been complete not completed
04:50 - but it's installed all right uh once
04:53 - that you can go ahead and close this out
04:54 - no problem no problem
04:57 - and at this point let's go and go ahead
04:59 - and open obvious code i will do new
05:01 - window on my side i do not need this
05:03 - portion of this
05:04 - right here that portion goes somewhere
05:06 - else for me
05:08 - i could probably do it somewhere else
05:10 - let me go ahead and put this portion
05:11 - desktop too there we go
05:13 - all right beautiful all right so this is
05:15 - obvious code
05:16 - let's open this up on the left hand side
05:18 - and put my testicle on the right hand
05:20 - side so it's a little bit better
05:21 - all right i like it and let's do file
05:24 - open
05:25 - file open beautiful go to github
05:29 - and then go to nas and then this is the
05:31 - tesla code that we just opened up right
05:33 - so i will open up tesla clone here
05:35 - okay beautiful all right so
05:38 - okay and let's see what we've got so far
05:42 - all right there's a tesla car that got
05:43 - beautiful um what do we have well
05:46 - to actually start this let's go right
05:47 - click this go ahead and open in
05:49 - integrated terminal all right and what
05:52 - we will do is we'll do
05:53 - yarn what yarn start so we're gonna use
05:56 - yarn this time because it's okay you can
05:58 - use both
05:59 - npm and yarn are both amazing so and
06:02 - yarn start
06:04 - boom that's going to start our
06:06 - application
06:08 - hope you guys can hear me all well yeah
06:10 - it's going to start application
06:12 - uh this is not pre-recorded this is
06:14 - actually live guys by the way it says
06:16 - i'm live i can see you i can see you
06:18 - right now in the comments if you say hi
06:19 - i'll say hi back to you
06:21 - as simple as that all right let's go
06:23 - ahead and do that
06:24 - beautiful nice nice nice nice nice
06:28 - okay let's see let's see let's see
06:31 - okay all right so this is our webpage
06:34 - that we have right now
06:34 - this is not a v-test local don't you
06:38 - worry okay
06:39 - uh this is just a starter application
06:41 - that react usually comes with right
06:43 - so at this point uh
06:46 - what are we going to do all right we
06:48 - need to erase some of this stuff let's
06:50 - go ahead and go to app.js
06:52 - right here and let's go to the header
06:57 - and let's remove this stuff honestly we
06:58 - don't need any of this stuff right here
07:00 - sayonara baby done you're away all right
07:03 - now we have a white screen which is
07:05 - pretty good too right we've got
07:06 - ourselves the white screen
07:07 - all right hit enter all good let's go to
07:10 - some index.css
07:11 - some of this stuff we don't need as well
07:12 - so we can remove some of this stuff
07:14 - which is just unnecessary
07:16 - too okay all right beautiful and so here
07:19 - we go
07:20 - now at this point a few things that we
07:23 - need to do as well
07:24 - is we need to divide this into
07:28 - application into a few different pieces
07:30 - correct and what kind of pieces would
07:32 - you divide this into well let's think
07:34 - about this right
07:35 - if i will if i have something like this
07:37 - right
07:38 - here's we have we have this application
07:40 - this might be like the whole app right
07:42 - so this is the whole app
07:43 - after that what do we have well we have
07:44 - the header right we have the header
07:46 - which is this one
07:47 - right this header might be divided into
07:48 - a few different parts as well we've got
07:50 - the logo
07:51 - we might have ourselves the menu like
07:54 - maybe we call it like the left menu icon
07:56 - or the left menu bar
07:57 - and then we have the right menu right
07:59 - there right underneath that we have the
08:01 - actual
08:02 - content or which is this we will call
08:04 - like a section right
08:06 - and now this section now has a few
08:08 - different things right let's think about
08:10 - it
08:10 - okay well the first job is like this
08:12 - text component so this contains like the
08:14 - model s
08:15 - the order online and stuff like that
08:17 - right so that's what called a text
08:18 - component okay
08:20 - then what do we have we have a button
08:22 - component right here
08:23 - okay it's a button component that will
08:25 - contain the buttons like custom order
08:27 - existing delivery and so forth
08:29 - and our last one is going to be this
08:30 - really fancy bouncing
08:34 - bouncing bouncing bouncing
08:37 - uh arrow okay um and that's pretty much
08:40 - it and our goal is to repeat these
08:42 - components so forth and so forth as you
08:44 - kind of go forward and so forth i see
08:46 - right there see
08:47 - right so that's pretty much it and as we
08:49 - repeat
08:50 - uh you know there's nothing else to it
08:52 - um
08:53 - and of course after that we'll figure
08:55 - out how to create the other pages like
08:56 - the detail page and so forth okay
08:59 - all right beautiful so let's go ahead
09:01 - and get started
09:04 - alright beautiful so as we said the
09:06 - first we need to create is
09:08 - going to be the header component and
09:09 - let's go ahead and do that so
09:11 - i will do source new folder and i will
09:14 - say components
09:16 - i'm not component components
09:20 - components component okay let's go
09:23 - do a new file and we'll say header dot
09:26 - js
09:27 - okay all right and i'm going to use
09:29 - something called react snippets as you
09:31 - can see
09:32 - right here we have something called es7
09:34 - react snippet so hopefully you guys can
09:36 - install that as well on your side
09:38 - um right if you install those don't have
09:40 - them go ahead and click install
09:42 - i already have them installed but what
09:43 - they will help me to do is if i go to
09:45 - header.js check this out
09:47 - all i got to do is type at the following
09:48 - rfce
09:50 - done hit enter right like this is pretty
09:54 - cool
09:54 - what do we have ourselves well we have
09:55 - ourselves a function component
09:57 - that's what we had ourselves right here
09:59 - okay and if i say header here
10:01 - right here right and then i'm going to
10:04 - import the header into app.js so let's
10:06 - do that right now
10:07 - so we'll go ahead and do import what
10:10 - import header
10:11 - from from what well a few things
10:14 - components so
10:15 - we'll have to hit the components folder
10:17 - slash header
10:18 - voila beautiful all right and we'll use
10:21 - the header now
10:22 - like so okay save that and let's go
10:26 - ahead and see
10:26 - our new beautiful
10:31 - what is it our beautiful header
10:33 - component
10:34 - which is just pretty much just a header
10:35 - text um let's actually make it
10:37 - much better right so here's what we can
10:39 - do now at this point guys is
10:41 - let's go ahead and go to index.css and a
10:43 - few things i want to do
10:44 - is to change right um let's go ahead and
10:48 - target everything right now right so
10:49 - again nothing crazy so far
10:51 - let's go and target everything and the
10:53 - first thing is we're going to change the
10:54 - one with change the font
10:55 - family right to make it more robotic
10:58 - you know it says rubik rubik's cube
11:01 - whatever it's going to be
11:02 - all right that could be the first one
11:03 - let's go and change the color of also of
11:05 - this
11:06 - specific what of the specific um
11:10 - good of this webpage so this will apply
11:12 - to everything pretty much
11:13 - right this color will apply to every
11:15 - every any type of text
11:16 - right i just want to keep it consistent
11:18 - i'll give it a margin of zero
11:20 - so that there's all these headings do
11:21 - not have all these crazy margins which i
11:23 - don't like
11:23 - and give it a padding of zero as well
11:26 - okay good
11:27 - all right awesome and we're going to use
11:29 - the code something called border
11:31 - size oh no box sizing border box now for
11:34 - those of you who don't know what this
11:35 - is it's basically when you say the width
11:38 - of something it's going to include the
11:39 - padding
11:41 - within that div it's a little bit
11:43 - confusing but basically
11:44 - uh this will allow us to better control
11:46 - the width of the actual dibs
11:48 - that's what that will allow us to do box
11:50 - sizing will say border box
11:52 - border dash box
11:57 - there we go so i know i have a hard time
12:00 - typing sometimes guys so you can see
12:02 - [Laughter]
12:03 - all right let's go ahead and focus on
12:04 - the body now so we'll do body
12:06 - and we'll give it a width of what width
12:08 - of a hundred percent right here
12:10 - okay good and honestly
12:14 - that's pretty much it okay with 100
12:16 - that's all i need so far
12:17 - okay good uh let's go back to our this
12:21 - okay you see our header now looks a
12:22 - little bit more different which is
12:23 - completely okay
12:25 - after the header what do we say we need
12:27 - to create we need to create the actual
12:29 - home
12:30 - home page right so we have the home page
12:32 - and we have the header okay
12:33 - um let's create the home page now and
12:36 - components
12:37 - do new file and we'll do home.js
12:41 - beautiful all right all right and we'll
12:44 - do rfce
12:45 - again i love this one rfce
12:48 - and you got yourself a seat i don't know
12:50 - whatever
12:52 - all right uh same thing this one let's
12:54 - go ahead and do home
12:55 - okay we'll import inside app.js right
12:58 - here
12:59 - and so forth home
13:02 - dash like this okay import it right here
13:05 - so import
13:07 - importante import
13:10 - home from what components
13:14 - compontentos commonentos component
13:18 - dash home okay don't judge me
13:21 - [Music]
13:22 - all right good let's see what we got so
13:24 - far and we got ourselves a home
13:26 - component
13:26 - i'm going to come with the header one
13:28 - for now just temporarily because i'm
13:29 - going to focus
13:30 - only on the home component right now
13:33 - okay
13:34 - and again i just want to make sure this
13:35 - is clear if you cannot follow along
13:37 - don't worry about it you know this is
13:39 - you know this will be available
13:41 - after you know the this is done so don't
13:43 - worry about if you cannot follow along
13:45 - just go ahead and review it again
13:46 - all right beautiful so the home
13:47 - component is there which i really really
13:50 - like
13:50 - um now let's focus on a few different
13:52 - things within the home
13:54 - component uh and let's go to home.gs
13:58 - now for the styling we're going to use
14:00 - something called style components and we
14:02 - need to install them first
14:03 - so go to your terminal let's go ahead
14:05 - and click plus on it
14:06 - and we'll do yarn add and we'll do
14:10 - styled
14:10 - dash style dash components
14:14 - style dash
14:18 - [Music]
14:21 - yarn add yarn there we go
14:28 - so it's going to go ahead and add the
14:30 - yarn
14:32 - all right save that that's all good and
14:34 - we will now import
14:36 - import styled from what
14:40 - okay improved from styled dash
14:44 - components good save that
14:48 - all right now for this component the
14:50 - first time we're going to create
14:52 - something called the
14:52 - container component so we'll do this
14:55 - container
14:55 - no not container container
15:00 - okidoke okidoki container
15:04 - there we go container that's going to be
15:06 - our first component we'll do
15:07 - and with the container component let's
15:09 - go ahead is equal to style so this is
15:11 - basically will give us
15:13 - allow us to style the specific div right
15:15 - that's the power of style components
15:17 - instead of doing it inside css we do
15:19 - inside javascript
15:21 - and so it just makes things a lot easier
15:22 - for us right and
15:24 - now we'll do a height height of what 100
15:27 - vh
15:29 - oh 100 vh good how are you guys doing by
15:33 - the way all doing good is everybody
15:34 - doing good
15:35 - everybody's still kind of on track with
15:36 - me if you guys are let me know
15:38 - let me know let me know let me see
15:40 - everybody's doing amazing
15:41 - [Music]
15:43 - somebody uh somebody says i like how nas
15:45 - uses the different boxes to show us the
15:47 - different
15:48 - uh yeah different things that's amazing
15:49 - awesome thank you thank you
15:51 - i appreciate you guys all right so a
15:54 - height of 100 vh so let's go ahead and
15:55 - save that and let's look at what we have
15:57 - so far
15:57 - nothing okay it's kapusta it's pretty
15:59 - much nothing right now
16:00 - okay again what we're making right now
16:03 - is
16:03 - what well we're making the component
16:06 - that's going to be
16:07 - this component right here so it's this
16:09 - whole component right which is this
16:11 - yellow component that's what we're
16:12 - looking at right now right this whole
16:14 - yellow component that's the home.js
16:16 - okay um and
16:19 - within this home.js let's think about
16:21 - kind of well how are we going to create
16:23 - all these sections right we have this
16:25 - one section another one
16:26 - section another section and you can see
16:28 - the style of them was just pretty much
16:30 - the same
16:31 - you see they're pretty much the same
16:32 - right there so
16:35 - logically speaking what if we just
16:36 - create another cabinet called section
16:39 - and that will allow us to reuse it every
16:40 - single time
16:42 - so if i right click on it let's do a new
16:44 - file and i say
16:45 - section section
16:53 - and we'll do rfce here too and enter
16:56 - okay section is what we need to type in
17:00 - go to 100.s and let's import our first
17:02 - section so
17:03 - say import section
17:06 - section from what from
17:09 - from what well because our current
17:11 - home.js is inside the components
17:14 - folder we don't need anything else
17:16 - besides that right um
17:18 - we don't as anything else besides that
17:20 - instead what we need

17:46 - now this is where the magic happens okay
17:48 - the magic happens now here all right
17:52 - okay so if we go to our section.js
17:55 - a few things that we need to really
17:56 - consider okay just how we consider this
17:59 - what do we say let's go ahead and create
18:00 - this text component first

20:42 - out how to actually get you into the
20:43 - boot camp okay
20:44 - awesome that's pretty much it let's go
20:46 - ahead and continue on beautiful all
20:47 - right
20:49 - uh a section okay
20:52 - what's gonna happen in this section uh
20:55 - the wrap
20:55 - is nothing nothing crazy the wrap is
20:57 - gonna be width of a hundred percent
20:59 - width of 100 v we'll call it vw
21:03 - vw it's like the car vw you know that
21:05 - was my first car actually
21:06 - 100 vw which is the full view width
21:09 - right that's the fuel view width that's
21:11 - what it means okay
21:12 - then we'll give it a height as well and
21:14 - we'll give it a height of what
21:16 - a hundred vh right here a hundred vh so
21:20 - a hundred vertical
21:21 - height pretty much is what it says okay
21:24 - all right let's get the background color
21:26 - background of like orange just so you
21:27 - can see
21:28 - exactly what we are working with all
21:29 - right
21:31 - there we go right so this is all working
21:33 - right write the whole view view with the
21:35 - whole view height okay
21:37 - all right um at this point let's go
21:39 - ahead and give it a background image and
21:41 - the background image
21:42 - should be this one right here now where
21:44 - you get this background image
21:45 - again what's gonna happen is we have a
21:48 - google drive
21:49 - folder with all the images down below
21:51 - right so if you all you have to do is
21:53 - just
21:53 - simply open this on this one up you open
21:56 - the google drive folder
21:57 - the images folder and you put it inside
22:00 - your public folder like so
22:01 - so right now i have no images folder of
22:03 - course i can
22:05 - actually open it open up the google
22:07 - drive folder
22:08 - inside my application let me go ahead
22:11 - and take a look at it where i can do
22:12 - that
22:13 - [Music]
22:15 - let me see where do i have it one second
22:18 - i think i have right here actually
22:20 - yeah i have the images folder right here
22:27 - there we go so i have my images folder
22:30 - right here right
22:31 - so this is the one that that you guys
22:33 - will get
22:34 - um if you go ahead and download the
22:36 - google drive folder just go ahead and go
22:37 - description below download it from there
22:39 - and you'll be all good
22:40 - and then all you need to do is need to
22:42 - unzip it of course and then once you've
22:44 - got that just grab
22:45 - that and then drag it into the public
22:47 - folder right like
22:48 - like so just drag it in done right and
22:51 - now it's all in here right
22:52 - this is a lot of different stuff for you
22:55 - um
22:55 - you know between the model s the model
22:57 - three all these different images that
22:58 - you need to use okay
23:00 - so if you got that let me know down in
23:01 - the comments and then we'll make sure to
23:03 - take care of you okay
23:04 - beautiful all right uh let's continue on
23:10 - okay all right so when we do the
23:13 - background image
23:13 - well we have a background image called
23:15 - model s.jpg so hopefully
23:17 - everybody was able to get those images
23:19 - like i said link is down in the
23:20 - description below alright
23:22 - uh background image so far nothing
23:25 - showing up which is completely fine
23:27 - let's go ahead and remove this
23:28 - background no i don't want that it's
23:30 - quite hideous
23:31 - there we go um the image is actually
23:33 - there we just don't see it because
23:35 - we need to center it vertically so we
23:37 - need to center the actual background
23:38 - image and to do that what i
23:40 - like to say something like background
23:42 - that size
23:44 - is equal to cover not covered but cover
23:47 - boom you see now all of a sudden this
23:49 - becomes a very different image
23:50 - right there see okay now let's do
23:54 - at that point let's go and center this
23:55 - image the background image and to do
23:57 - that
23:58 - we'll do background um position so
24:01 - background
24:02 - background dash position position and
24:05 - we'll give it
24:06 - a center boom voila
24:11 - center right back position back no i
24:14 - i did this one back go
24:17 - round position there we go see now this
24:22 - car is pushing the center which is
24:23 - exactly what we want to do then let's go
24:25 - ahead and make sure it does not repeat
24:27 - itself so we'll do back on repeat now
24:28 - repeat
24:29 - so we'll do background
24:33 - dash repeat i will say no
24:37 - sorry about that repeat there we go
24:41 - now repeat but no repeat no right there
24:43 - now repeat all right so now it's going
24:44 - to change at this point right
24:46 - we still have ourselves everything we
24:48 - need to have and that's pretty pretty
24:49 - much it okay
24:50 - okay that's what i want you to focus on
24:54 - for now
24:54 - now let's go ahead and add in the tax
24:56 - component stuff okay
24:58 - all we need to create of course is not
24:59 - going to be this text component which is
25:01 - right here
25:02 - and we're going to call it something
25:03 - called item text so item text
25:07 - okay and inside this item text a few
25:09 - things we need to go ahead and create
25:11 - is of course if we look at our test.com
25:13 - what do we have we have a header
25:15 - and we have like a subheader and to make
25:18 - that happen here's what we'll do
25:19 - we'll do an h1 tag each one
25:22 - and this h1 will have the title for now
25:24 - let's just say the title
25:26 - will be model s this is the one the
25:28 - title so model s for now
25:30 - this is temporary data placeholder data
25:32 - okay
25:33 - model s okay beautiful and then uh we'll
25:36 - do
25:36 - another one that's gonna be what the p
25:39 - tag
25:40 - p tag oh let's go ahead and remove that
25:44 - right the p tag and this one's going to
25:46 - have order online
25:48 - for touch as delivery right there
25:51 - boom it and i'll be honest with you it
25:54 - actually is touch's delivery when i
25:55 - ordered the tesla
25:56 - it's like literally it was like chris's
25:58 - morning i woke up in the morning and the
26:00 - car was there on my driveway it was
26:01 - pretty insane i will say
26:03 - like they bring it into you and you you
26:04 - don't have to do nothing you just sign
26:06 - and you sign in on your
26:08 - on your tesla account and then you just
26:09 - say okay take delivery
26:11 - it's pretty cool i will say okay order
26:14 - online for touchless delivery
26:17 - all right and then once we got that
26:19 - let's go ahead and save this of course
26:21 - and to create the item text component
26:23 - here so we'll say const
26:25 - item text is equal to what styled
26:29 - right here styled div
26:34 - okay good all right and with this one
26:37 - uh what do we need to do nothing nothing
26:39 - too crazy we're going to give it some
26:40 - padding top so
26:41 - you can see you already have it here
26:42 - it's pretty good so we need
26:44 - so we'll do padding top dash top and
26:47 - that will be 15 vh
26:49 - 15 vh vh
26:56 - that's pretty funny okay and then we'll
26:58 - do text line center because you know
27:00 - just to align the center technically
27:01 - where it is centered but it's okay
27:04 - okay there we go you see now model s
27:07 - is right here all right that part is
27:09 - done let's
27:10 - look at our next part that we need to
27:11 - figure out which is gonna be the what
27:13 - that's going to be now the buttons right
27:15 - so that's gonna be these buttons right
27:17 - here okay
27:19 - button group okay uh all right let's go
27:21 - ahead and create that component
27:23 - we'll create the component that will
27:24 - actually wrap these buttons right so
27:26 - uh the buttons that we need to go ahead
27:28 - and wrap are these buttons right here
27:30 - right so
27:31 - this is going to be the button group
27:34 - that we're going to create right now
27:35 - okay called the button group right
27:38 - button
27:41 - button sorry my hobo handwriting but i'm
27:44 - trying my best
27:45 - button group okay all right so i'll say
27:48 - button
27:49 - button i'd like to say bhutan in korean
27:52 - means
27:52 - bread
27:56 - group you know and then there'll be a
28:00 - few bundles that we need to create
28:01 - inside here
28:02 - the one is going to be left button and
28:03 - then it's going to be a right button as
28:05 - well so we'll say
28:06 - left button
28:11 - you like my accent and then the right
28:13 - button
28:14 - right but done okay good
28:17 - and then of course all these buttons
28:19 - will have a few different uh
28:20 - there'll be one is gonna be custom order
28:22 - so let's go ahead and do the custom
28:24 - order one
28:26 - so this could be custom order no i'm not
28:29 - i don't know what that was honestly
28:31 - [Music]
28:32 - custom order save that and the last one
28:35 - is going to be
28:36 - existing inventory existing
28:41 - existing inventory
28:44 - inventory inventory
28:48 - existing inventory that's the one that
28:49 - we're looking at okay
28:51 - beautiful all right existing inventory
28:53 - and let's see what we have so far
28:55 - um well that we need to create the
28:58 - actual combust groups
29:00 - of course so let's do that right now all
29:02 - right
29:03 - so we'll do the what we'll do const
29:06 - button group is equal to styled.div uh
29:12 - that there for now
29:13 - okay uh nothing crazy so far let's go
29:16 - ahead and create the button the actual
29:18 - that
29:18 - button so we'll do const left button is
29:21 - equal to also style that div
29:23 - okay boom and now for the right bouton
29:28 - the right button we're going to now use
29:31 - the left button
29:32 - as a reference so what does that mean if
29:34 - i say right button
29:37 - button is equal to saying style div
29:38 - style.div can be styled
29:40 - button left button you see this lab
29:43 - button
29:44 - why because it's allow us to inherit all
29:46 - the css of the left button
29:48 - that's pretty much the reason okay now
29:52 - with the button group what are we going
29:53 - to do with the button group uh nothing
29:55 - too crazy so far
29:56 - um let's go ahead and actually focus on
29:58 - the left buttons that's what i want us
29:59 - to focus on
30:00 - right now specifically okay okay
30:03 - so left bouton all right um
30:07 - okay let's do the following
30:10 - let's see what happens here nothing oh
30:12 - we have some stuff we have custom order
30:13 - and stuff like that okay that's fine
30:15 - all right um for this specific section
30:17 - here's we'll do we'll do
30:18 - background color of this left bouton is
30:21 - the following
30:22 - right background color is this color
30:24 - right here
30:25 - okay good that's the background color
30:29 - all right
30:32 - remove this stuff right here on this
30:34 - side that's a background color and then
30:36 - what we need to do
30:37 - is let's do a height of 40 pixels
30:40 - height height of what 40 pixels
30:44 - okay and then we'll give it a width of
30:46 - 256 pixels
30:48 - width of 200 256 pixels
30:53 - okay good all right save that
30:56 - okay sure it's all good and let's see we
30:58 - have so far and so far like it's just
30:59 - it's nasty right so
31:00 - but that's okay don't worry about it
31:01 - right and then what we'll do is
31:04 - we'll give it a color so color of white
31:06 - so
31:07 - white okay now yeah white so that's
31:09 - gonna be the text color
31:11 - so you can see now here the text color
31:12 - right here that's a white text color
31:14 - okay
31:14 - now these are two divs and let's go
31:16 - ahead and center them in the center
31:17 - right
31:18 - so the mini will do display flags on
31:20 - them flex it always selects it
31:24 - splay fox
31:27 - and then we'll do what uh we'll do
31:30 - justify content
31:32 - to center horizontally right
31:33 - horizontally justify content center
31:37 - so we'll do justify
31:40 - let's go ahead and do it this way
31:42 - [Music]
31:44 - justify
31:46 - content that's going to be center good
31:48 - all right and then we'll do online item
31:50 - center as well
31:53 - right items center
31:56 - as well okay good okay now what do we
31:59 - have so far right
32:00 - justify content align items center okay
32:04 - um now these are two buttons right so
32:06 - let's go ahead now to make them more
32:08 - look like buttons let's go ahead and add
32:09 - a border radius so we'll do what
32:11 - border dash radius
32:14 - right and that was going to be what
32:16 - let's go give it a 100 pixels
32:20 - oh would you look at that now we have
32:22 - our sometimes
32:23 - now we like to look at right i was going
32:25 - to get opacity
32:28 - it's going to be 0.85
32:31 - right okay so now we have an opacity
32:34 - that just kind of stays there which is
32:35 - pretty pretty cool okay
32:37 - all right then the next one is going to
32:38 - be what well
32:40 - let's do text transformed make sure it's
32:42 - all uppercase so text transform
32:46 - form all uppercase
32:50 - okay nice that looks sick that looks
32:53 - amazing
32:54 - let's give the smaller font size as well
32:57 - so font dash size is going to be what
33:00 - that's pretty much just 12 pixels
33:02 - something's nothing crazy ah there you
33:04 - go good good good i like it i like it
33:05 - right so
33:06 - that's that's the font size and then
33:08 - what um
33:09 - we need to stack them from left to right
33:11 - that's what we need to figure out how to
33:13 - do right
33:13 - how do you stack them from left to right
33:15 - that's a big question right so
33:17 - to do that uh well a few things we need
33:20 - to go the button group and say display
33:22 - flex on this one
33:25 - boom boom right there you see right away
33:28 - we know what right away it stacks from
33:30 - left to right that's what this display
33:32 - flex allows
33:32 - allowed us to do okay now how do we put
33:35 - this custom order this is
33:36 - the inventory kind of from more at the
33:38 - bottom
33:39 - that's the question i want us to ask
33:41 - right well
33:42 - this happens a few ways well because if
33:45 - we go to the wrap
33:46 - right the wrap controls what let me go
33:49 - ahead and remove
33:50 - this portion now at this point the wrap
33:52 - controls
33:54 - what controls this whole thing right
33:56 - this whole thing right
33:58 - this whole thing right and if i do
34:01 - display flex on it i can actually push
34:03 - these
34:04 - away so that this goes all the way to
34:06 - the bottom
34:07 - right that's what my goal is right so on
34:10 - the wrap i'm going to say display flex
34:14 - display i will say the flex
34:17 - flex it flex it flex it like i said
34:20 - don't forget it
34:22 - display flex beautiful and then at that
34:25 - point what's gonna happen is
34:27 - we'll do what flex direction column
34:30 - right so basic column means we're gonna
34:32 - put it from top to bottom
34:34 - that's what that means okay right
34:36 - direction
34:38 - column there we go see now it's back to
34:41 - normal again
34:42 - now to actually fully make your work all
34:45 - i got to do
34:45 - and actually push this to the bottom
34:47 - well i do something like
34:49 - um justify content space between so
34:53 - justify content
34:56 - right and then space dash
35:00 - between boom
35:03 - oh you look at that it's like all the
35:05 - way over there you guys see that right
35:07 - there
35:07 - that is beautiful all right let's go
35:10 - ahead and do a line item center to align
35:12 - it horizontally
35:13 - so interesting part is you need to know
35:15 - is
35:16 - justified content usually does alignment
35:19 - for
35:19 - horizontal section right so if you want
35:21 - to write align something horizontally
35:22 - right
35:23 - that's what that's the content is for
35:25 - and usually like items is going to be a
35:26 - vertical alignment okay
35:29 - but when you switch the flex direction
35:32 - it switches it flips now justify content
35:36 - is going to be
35:36 - for it's going to be for this one is
35:40 - going to be
35:40 - for vertical alignment vertical
35:44 - and then align items now
35:49 - if i do center right here
35:52 - that's going to be for horizontal
35:54 - alignment or
35:56 - horizontal you see what i mean so the
35:58 - flips when you do flash rushing column
36:00 - you can see now the custom order they're
36:01 - actually they are actually properly
36:03 - aligned right now okay beautiful
36:06 - uh what i want us to focus on now is
36:08 - going to be the
36:08 - [Music]
36:10 - the button group let's go ahead and take
36:12 - this button let's give it a margin
36:13 - bottom
36:16 - margin bottom margin bottom off
36:20 - about 30 pixels
36:24 - nice so it's kind of it's a little
36:25 - better now there too okay so i like that
36:27 - a lot better now
36:28 - right and what else do we have let's for
36:30 - these specific
36:31 - buttons let's give them what let's give
36:33 - them a cursor pointer as well so left
36:35 - button
36:36 - this could be cursor
36:39 - cursor pointer okay save that
36:43 - all right so now there i can let me see
36:45 - cur sir
36:46 - cursor okay save that you see i can
36:49 - now exist at the cursor as well all
36:51 - right
36:52 - now a few things opacity is 0.85 that's
36:55 - so good opacity is good
36:57 - a few things i want to focus on um let's
37:00 - add
37:00 - this specific portion remember this one
37:03 - this this like
37:07 - well that is just simply an arrow that's
37:09 - all it is nothing too crazy
37:11 - um so to do that what we'll do is we'll
37:14 - create something called a down arrow
37:16 - and it's all it's just an image right so
37:18 - here's what we'll do
37:19 - we'll create outside the button group
37:21 - and we'll say the following
37:25 - we'll say down arrow
37:29 - like so source is equal to what source
37:32 - is going to be equal to
37:33 - images down here that's vg so we have
37:35 - that inside the images folder again
37:37 - if you want the link to it down below
37:39 - okay
37:41 - boom down arrow okay
37:45 - down arrow images down here right here
37:48 - it's not defined
37:48 - again it's going to create that
37:52 - let's create that down already to create
37:53 - to create
37:56 - so we'll do here we'll do what const
38:00 - down arrow down arrow
38:04 - okay is equal to what is equal to styled
38:07 - dot
38:07 - image right there okay on this image a
38:10 - few things we need to kind of create
38:12 - we'll do margin top
38:14 - margin dash
38:17 - dash top that's going to be 20 pixels to
38:21 - give us some spacing
38:22 - right and then we'll give it a height so
38:25 - a height
38:27 - oh height of what 40 pixels
38:32 - okay nice so it says style
38:35 - styled styled
38:38 - there we go all right so the arrow is
38:41 - now there the custom order is there so
38:43 - it's not the best
38:45 - solutions we need right so um don't
38:47 - worry we'll fix that in a second here
38:49 - okay so you can see what do we have now
38:51 - here's the issue this is now here
38:53 - and this is now here bad right because
38:56 - why
38:56 - because when we did justify content we
38:58 - did space between meaning it's going to
38:59 - create as much space in between every
39:01 - single component here
39:02 - right that's what space in between means
39:05 - right
39:06 - but how do we fix it well very simple by
39:09 - actually
39:10 - making this making this one component
39:14 - right right so for example
39:17 - if i say simply there's buttons i give
39:20 - like this
39:21 - buttons okay check this out
39:25 - buttons okay boom
39:30 - what's gonna happen now what do you
39:31 - think
39:33 - oh new component correct yes yes yes yes
39:36 - that's gonna create new components so
39:38 - called buttons we'll say const
39:40 - buttons buttons equals equal to style
39:43 - that div
39:46 - save that right there see you see what
39:48 - just happened
39:49 - right see this just became like this
39:51 - right see but they're beautiful right
39:52 - it's exactly what we need what we need
39:54 - for this
39:54 - for this right there right there see
39:56 - beautiful and let's go back to now
39:58 - our page application now um
40:01 - how did that happen well because this
40:04 - whole thing became one component
40:06 - that's what happened right this whole
40:07 - thing became one component and so this
40:09 - just pushed it down like this all right
40:12 - all right uh up next let's go ahead and
40:15 - create a little margin between every
40:16 - single button so if i go to my
40:19 - left button i will do margin what i will
40:22 - go ahead and do the following which is
40:23 - margin i think we'll give it 20 pixels
40:26 - i think that's pretty good um either
40:28 - that or
40:30 - just maybe eight pixels see margin
40:33 - margin e pixels
40:35 - like this okay much better much better
40:38 - now i would like for this thing to hop
40:42 - so uh we're gonna make it hop how uh
40:45 - well we're going to create animation
40:48 - we're going to create animation okay
40:52 - uh to do to make that happen here's
40:54 - animation it's gonna be animation called
40:56 - animate down
40:57 - and if i go to my down arrow in here
41:00 - boom right there
41:01 - check this out so right now nothing's
41:03 - happening because we have not created
41:04 - animation you see so it's just kind of
41:05 - like it's like
41:06 - meh right it's mac right now but don't
41:08 - you worry we got you
41:10 - okay don't you worry we got you um
41:13 - what i'm gonna do now at this point is
41:14 - very simple is i will go to index.css
41:18 - right here and i'm going to create the
41:21 - animation myself
41:22 - right this is using keyframes right
41:25 - using keyframes is what it's going to do
41:27 - and i'm just going to copy and paste
41:28 - this here because i'm going to type it
41:29 - out all
41:30 - for you right and what these are is very
41:32 - simple
41:33 - here's what happened imagine like for
41:35 - example
41:36 - that you know uh so keyframes are like
41:39 - percentages of like
41:40 - uh of the actual um of the actual text
41:43 - or the diff for example right
41:45 - so at zero twenty percent you know
41:47 - nothing now forty percent we're going to
41:49 - translate
41:50 - translate basically five pixels up
41:53 - you see right there you see then the
41:56 - same tips are gonna translate
41:58 - three pixels up now at fifty percent
42:01 - we're gonna translate to zero
42:03 - so that's what creates this up and down
42:05 - feeling so if i save this right now
42:08 - boom see that's what crease is upside
42:10 - down up and down filming
42:13 - you see
42:18 - up and down kind of like feeling type
42:20 - and so forth right
42:21 - um this also creates a little bit of an
42:23 - issue with overflow as you can see right
42:25 - here
42:25 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
42:27 - give overflow hidden on this specific
42:29 - down arrow
42:31 - right here so this down arrow you see
42:33 - how it creates an overflow
42:34 - well we can fix that by just going to
42:36 - section right
42:37 - and i'm going to say overflow hidden
42:39 - overflow
42:40 - overflow x overflow dash x
42:45 - is going to be hidden
42:48 - boom okay overflow
42:52 - overflow axis hidden let's see down
42:54 - arrow is
42:55 - that let's go ahead maybe fix it using
42:58 - what
42:58 - what can we use fix it using what da da
43:01 - da da da da
43:02 - da da da what if i maybe i'll remove
43:04 - this portion let's go and remove this
43:07 - okay i kind of like that i don't want
43:10 - that margin top it kind of pushes away
43:11 - too much
43:12 - all right so that's good overflow x
43:16 - hidden
43:17 - uh if i go the body let's go to
43:20 - index.css
43:23 - oh okay i need to also do overflow
43:26 - overflow dash x can be hidden
43:31 - boom boom see to make sure we don't have
43:34 - the horizontal scroll bar that was there
43:36 - which would look hideous which i don't
43:37 - like
43:38 - all right so there you go so we got now
43:40 - our translation which is really good
43:41 - okay
43:42 - so we have a translation what's the next
43:44 - step where we are going to work on and
43:46 - that's going to be let me see what you
43:47 - guys are saying
43:48 - some sense is awesome that's awesome
43:51 - sweet
43:52 - uh scs is the way to go yes we'll
43:54 - actually go into scss at some point as
43:56 - well on this channel too
43:58 - uh are you building that using the react
43:59 - yes i am strange my buttons are not all
44:01 - the way
44:02 - down there what you put but yeah so now
44:05 - they're all down sweet now it's all good
44:08 - now it's all good now it's all good okay
44:10 - sweet all right everybody still with me
44:12 - everybody still with me
44:13 - yeah beautiful of course you are because
44:16 - you guys are amazing that's all i can
44:17 - say to you
44:18 - all right and again guys let's go and
44:20 - hit that like button smash the like
44:21 - button help us out with the youtube
44:22 - algorithm
44:23 - that's it that'll that really we'll
44:25 - write 673 likes let's get to
44:27 - 800 that'll be great all right um
44:31 - all right so we got that portion look at
44:33 - this uh let's go and change up this
44:34 - button now the existing delivery button
44:36 - because it actually
44:37 - is different here pretty simple
44:40 - because we go to our
44:43 - section.gs here's our button
44:47 - all we got to do is just change the
44:49 - button color
44:50 - so the right button instead of doing
44:52 - here nothing
44:54 - the right button will be the following
44:56 - the right button will be background
44:57 - color of white
45:02 - background that's gonna be white
45:07 - boom oh that's cool and i'm gonna give
45:09 - it opacity to
45:11 - opacity right 0.65.65
45:18 - we go okay and then we'll give the color
45:20 - of the text it's gonna be more on the
45:22 - darker side
45:23 - colors will be black
45:27 - there we go nice you see there you go
45:30 - now you got these two buttons and they
45:31 - look pretty
45:32 - good look at that look at that that's it
45:34 - that's all we just did
45:35 - we just did everything we need to do
45:36 - look at this
45:38 - huh how cool is that huh awesome all
45:41 - right so we're almost there now
45:43 - here check this out all we gotta do now
45:44 - this one is just replicate the same
45:45 - situation right
45:47 - so if i go ahead and go to sections now
45:50 - hold on yes
45:50 - if i copy this section and paste it
45:53 - everywhere
45:55 - all right if i paste this section check
45:57 - this out what's gonna happen
46:00 - we have more sections of the same
46:01 - sections there you go
46:03 - that's it now i want us to really figure
46:06 - out the one is like for example if i go
46:08 - small you see how
46:09 - the custom order just kind of like goes
46:12 - outside the boundary
46:13 - we can fix that too actually we can fix
46:15 - that very easily using like media
46:17 - queries right so
46:19 - so basically what we can do is on uh let
46:22 - me go ahead and take a look at let's go
46:24 - to section here
46:25 - you see button this button group right
46:27 - here
46:29 - this button group is
46:32 - it's actually fl flex direction row but
46:34 - if i would go ahead on the media what is
46:36 - what can do
46:38 - i can do media width like this so on the
46:41 - max with basically four
46:43 - four four like small uh max
46:46 - width of 768 pixels those are like small
46:50 - um screens i do flash just column and so
46:52 - they go into column basically meaning
46:55 - from top to bottom like this all right
46:58 - so to the side you see that just
46:59 - happened look at there
47:01 - you see
47:05 - right and how did this happen because
47:07 - when the width
47:08 - becomes 768 pixels you see
47:12 - it applies this right here css flash
47:15 - direction column
47:16 - that's what allows us to do this and
47:17 - that's it there's nothing crazier than
47:19 - that honestly
47:20 - all right so now here's the question now
47:23 - um
47:23 - how do we go ahead and make these model
47:25 - s stuff and make have all this stuff
47:26 - working differently right because
47:28 - what do we have right now it's just all
47:29 - panel s and of course we have model y by
47:31 - the way this is the one oh this is
47:32 - exactly the one i have by the way
47:33 - such a beautiful card look at this oh so
47:36 - good
47:37 - such a good car i love it
47:41 - the special is in this blue color it's
47:42 - so good once you guys agree with me
47:44 - like in a blue color like that's my
47:46 - favorite color by the way
47:47 - yeah uh anyways let's go ahead and do
47:50 - the following
47:51 - we have all these sections right and
47:54 - they're all the same
47:55 - so the question is like how do we make
47:57 - them different right how do we make them
47:58 - different so that they're all different
47:59 - i guess you can say
48:01 - um well we can just pass in something
48:02 - called props right and what are props
48:04 - props are like parameters for a function
48:06 - that's pretty much all it is
48:08 - it's a parameter for a function right so
48:11 - if we currently have the model s right
48:13 - and we have one section we can reuse
48:15 - this just change the title here
48:17 - so here's what i'll do i'll go to home
48:20 - or let's go i'll go to home here and for
48:23 - the section here
48:24 - look we'll pass in a few parameters it's
48:25 - just kind of like your passing
48:27 - parameters
48:28 - for a function that's pretty much it
48:30 - inside here
48:31 - i will pass in two three parameters so
48:33 - let's go ahead and do title
48:34 - okay not like this title is equal to
48:37 - what
48:38 - and this is gonna be model s right
48:41 - and then the description is all gonna be
48:44 - well pretty much you know delivery so
48:46 - the screw is going to be order online
48:49 - that's the description right here let me
48:51 - go ahead and make this better for you
48:53 - order online without just delete that
48:55 - description after that
48:57 - let's go ahead and do what let's do
48:59 - background image
49:03 - background image that's going to the
49:05 - model s one
49:07 - then we'll do the left button text
49:10 - right we have a left button that's gonna
49:13 - be the custom order
49:14 - and then the right button text is going
49:16 - to be existing inventory
49:19 - there you go okay
49:23 - let's go ahead and comment this portion
49:24 - out for temporarily okay
49:26 - because i want to show you how we're
49:28 - going to do this so this gets passed
49:30 - into props if i go into the section
49:31 - itself
49:33 - let's go ahead and go to section itself
49:35 - okay and i
49:36 - have props here they're basically like
49:38 - parameters
49:39 - if i just click console login because
49:42 - unlock props look this is
49:45 - i'll show you this for a second here so
49:47 - look props right click
49:48 - inspect element on this one and i'll
49:51 - show it to you within the console
49:53 - right here good all it is is props is
49:56 - just an object
49:57 - like that's all pretty much is and look
49:59 - at this all this stuff has been passed
50:01 - in
50:02 - right the background image the
50:03 - description the title and so forth
50:05 - and so now all i do is something like
50:06 - for example i do this
50:08 - i do the following what do i do i do
50:11 - props props.what
50:15 - dot title
50:18 - all right i save that browser title
50:21 - look at that look at that model s right
50:25 - here see
50:26 - the title like it was replaced by the
50:28 - actual title within
50:30 - the actual what the actual component
50:32 - right that's all we
50:33 - pretty much had to do okay now we can
50:36 - even be smart about this by
50:37 - being the following we can unpack this
50:40 - using something like this
50:41 - so i can do it like this
50:44 - title boom right there
50:48 - how cool is that okay
50:52 - okay how cool is that check this out so
50:53 - title is right there
50:55 - and i can replace this with title and
50:58 - all this done is this
50:59 - basically just unpacks this whole object
51:01 - this whole object has
51:02 - key and no key like background images so
51:05 - forth but this right here is called
51:06 - unpacking and we're unpacking the object
51:08 - to include
51:09 - to actually just get the get the actual
51:11 - keys that's that's all pretty much does
51:13 - all right so that's it let's go ahead
51:15 - and stop this for now
51:17 - good all right so we have that next one
51:19 - that we're going to unpack is which one
51:21 - that's a description good
51:25 - description which is which one comma
51:27 - description
51:28 - and we can use that here now
51:34 - description boom right there awesome
51:37 - you see again shows up right here okay
51:39 - beautiful just as
51:40 - just the way we like it okay next step
51:43 - is gonna be what
51:44 - the actual left button text so this is
51:46 - this one
51:47 - left button text right here
51:51 - that button text is going to be this one
51:53 - and then
51:54 - right there and then the right button
51:56 - text is going to be right here
52:00 - right button text
52:03 - so we'll use that as a prop as well okay
52:06 - right by text of course we do
52:07 - unpack them as well so we'll do what
52:09 - left button text
52:12 - copy that left button text right here
52:15 - comma right button text
52:19 - command c command v alright so we have
52:22 - unpacked all of these items
52:23 - inside here so if we save that right you
52:25 - can see you know still
52:26 - and nothing really changes but here's
52:28 - what can change if i go to home
52:30 - and if i uncomment some of this stuff
52:33 - okay now i have
52:34 - three different sections what i can do
52:36 - is just change the actual data
52:38 - so here's what i can do here inside this
52:41 - one
52:41 - i can give it the following here's my
52:43 - data here
52:47 - boom this one is title model.p y model
52:50 - one
52:51 - p y model.y that's the they ask the
52:53 - other one
52:54 - description order online background
52:56 - images now model y image and then left
52:58 - button text custom order and same thing
53:00 - here
53:00 - so if i save this
53:04 - oh look at that you see
53:08 - model y has changed now
53:11 - one thing has not changed is the actual
53:12 - image and we'll focus we'll we'll fix
53:14 - that in a second here
53:15 - next one let's do model three
53:19 - okay let's do model three now same thing
53:21 - you see so all we do is we're changing
53:22 - the props we're just passing different
53:24 - props and we're using the same html
53:26 - that's the coolest part about react.js
53:29 - good boom there we go save that
53:33 - let's see model three now again imaging
53:36 - does not change
53:36 - we'll change that a little bit okay next
53:39 - one
53:40 - model x let's do the model x one model x
53:43 - all right we'll do the following there
53:45 - so model x
53:47 - okay
53:51 - there we go
53:54 - okay model x all right same thing look
53:57 - at this
53:58 - model x you see it all just kind of
54:00 - works you know automatically no problem
54:02 - whatsoever
54:02 - now the one big thing we need to figure
54:04 - out is okay well how come
54:06 - the images are not showing well in the
54:08 - section because the image is the same
54:10 - right the image is which image it's uh
54:12 - this image right here
54:13 - that's a background image right um to
54:15 - fix that it's pretty simple actually
54:18 - let's go ahead and go to the home.js and
54:21 - inside actually let's go to section.js
54:23 - section and
54:26 - we need to pass in the actual background
54:28 - image you see we pass on this background
54:30 - image let's go ahead and copy this
54:31 - background image
54:32 - go to section and let's go ahead and
54:35 - unpack this
54:36 - right here comma unpack it
54:39 - right here unpack it so now we have it
54:42 - you know we actually have it inside our
54:43 - component
54:44 - and we need to use it somehow actually
54:47 - okay
54:48 - how do we use it well we use it by
54:50 - actually passing in
54:51 - um well passing in an actual component
54:53 - or a prop
54:54 - into a style component because you can
54:56 - do that too so
54:57 - we'll do bg background image
55:01 - background image background image and
55:03 - we'll say what equal
55:06 - boom right bg image that with a
55:09 - background image
55:10 - that's all and now all we do is inside
55:13 - what
55:16 - is inside our actual what our actual
55:19 - vga immersion wrap you see how we have
55:21 - the wrap here
55:23 - basically instead of doing this here's
55:24 - what we'll do in this case
55:26 - do it like this we'll say background
55:30 - image
55:33 - on this image okay let me just do it
55:36 - properly so you guys can have it
55:37 - let's see right here back on image okay
55:40 - and
55:41 - instead of doing like this i'll do like
55:42 - this
55:45 - okay props so we can actually get props
55:49 - inside style components we'll do props
55:52 - okay and after props
55:55 - what are we gonna say check this out
55:59 - okay dot dot
56:02 - we'll give a url here so i'll say url
56:07 - actually we'll do like this we'll say
56:09 - url
56:11 - and we'll be
56:14 - dash images dash
56:18 - dash the actual prop that we just passed
56:21 - in
56:22 - dash what that's what
56:26 - huh boom
56:30 - look at this tata look at this one
56:33 - that's pretty cool i will do props
56:37 - dot props.what
56:41 - wg image right there off the bg image
56:45 - cross wg image okay
56:49 - so let's see happens now so okay we have
56:51 - this images
56:52 - url and that has images is inside of
56:55 - that okay good
56:57 - okay let's see let's see let's see and
57:00 - then of course i think i think we need
57:01 - to close it as well let me go ahead and
57:02 - make sure
57:02 - it's all good so that's all good that
57:04 - should be all good
57:06 - url is right here that's the url
57:09 - back on yeah i think that's an issue
57:13 - all right let's go and say this
57:16 - background image okay
57:19 - cool now you're ready let's see if it
57:22 - actually changes anything so
57:23 - what's going to happen here we pass in
57:25 - the background image here
57:26 - voila okay then we happens then is that
57:30 - gets passed into the
57:31 - wrap style component right there see vg
57:34 - image
57:36 - then that gets passed to the prop so we
57:37 - have we get props from the actual style
57:39 - component
57:40 - now we have props and we set the
57:42 - background image using the prop
57:44 - so props url images
57:47 - props to bg image that's it
57:50 - save it oh
57:54 - let's go oh oh oh

60:38 - that
60:41 - nice let's go ahead and see okay now
60:43 - here's one
60:44 - issue that we found right so here's an
60:46 - issue
60:47 - we have the shop now button right shop
60:50 - now button
60:51 - and then because we only have one button
60:53 - here this created what issue well the
60:54 - fact that this channel
60:56 - is not the center which of course is bad
60:58 - so how do we fix that
61:00 - pretty simple if i now go to my
61:03 - section gs basically here's what i'll
61:06 - say
61:08 - if the right button exists only then
61:10 - while i go ahead and showcase it so
61:11 - here's what i'll do
61:12 - check this out i will say right button

61:19 - then i will go ahead and do the
61:20 - following and then only then will i do
61:22 - this
61:31 - right there that's all
61:35 - save it look at this you see shop now
61:39 - but is exactly the mail because why
61:41 - before the right button was always there
61:42 - just it had the empty right button text
61:44 - but now now what happened is we just
61:47 - said hey
61:48 - if the right button text exists only
61:50 - then do you show the right button
61:52 - the actual right button but if it's not
61:53 - does not exist forget about it don't
61:55 - even show it and the left button is
61:56 - going to be the only one that's left
61:58 - and that's pretty much it okay look at

69:10 - is equal to what styled dot div
69:19 - customize your style dot the viv okay
69:22 - also nothing crazy here
69:24 - let's go ahead and give some data or
69:27 - some styling for the actual container
69:29 - the actual header
69:30 - so the header will have a few things
69:31 - number one let's give it a min height
69:36 - min height of what of 60 pixels
69:40 - there we go okay 60 pixels okay good
69:43 - that's the min height right there see so
69:44 - it's a little bit bigger now that's good

69:49 - on the one position fixed so we actually
69:51 - want to be a
69:52 - in you know actually have fixed
69:54 - positioning and so to do that here's
69:56 - we'll do position

72:44 - fix that by
72:44 - going inside the index.css
72:48 - boom let's give the a tag so let's
72:50 - target all a tag
72:52 - a tag and we'll do text transformation
72:56 - or text transform
72:57 - none what does that mean or text
72:59 - equation not so text decoration
73:02 - because by default it's underlined where
73:06 - is it right here that's the default one
73:07 - but instead we'll just say what none so
73:10 - if i say that
73:11 - see it's gone nice beautiful
73:15 - all right next one is in the menu you
73:18 - see how they're kind of
73:19 - one on one one on top of each other we
73:21 - can fix it also by using display flex
73:24 - let's go to menu okay
73:27 - and in the menu all we gotta do is the
73:30 - following
73:31 - it's just display flex it
73:34 - display flex
73:37 - display flex it that's how we do it
73:42 - and we'll do online items no no we'll do
73:44 - display flex which
73:46 - let's go ahead and save that nice
73:49 - beautiful
73:50 - we will do align item center
73:56 - good beautiful that's amazing
74:03 - okay nice nice nice line up center
74:06 - that center is it let's go ahead and
74:08 - also give it maybe some spacing i would
74:09 - say so as well
74:11 - uh and to do that let's go ahead and
74:13 - target the actual
74:14 - uh let's see uh
74:17 - p within this here so we'll do what
74:20 - font wait
74:24 - i will do what let's do it here let's do
74:27 - a font
74:27 - weight wait it's going to be 600
74:32 - okay good nice beautiful and we'll do
74:37 - a text decoration text decoration
74:42 - creation that's going to be uppercase
74:47 - boom did now workout
74:50 - text decoration text transform actually
74:52 - text transform my bad
74:54 - transform there we go model s models
74:58 - three
74:58 - beautiful nice
75:01 - and then let's go ahead and give it some
75:03 - padding so for every single pizza i will
75:05 - give a padding so padding
75:07 - padding is gonna be 0
75:11 - 10 pixels 0 this in this case means top
75:14 - and bottom so basically top of bottom 0
75:16 - left and right is 10 pixels that's what
75:18 - that means
75:20 - boom right there see right there see
75:24 - oh let's also do a flex wrap flex um
75:28 - wrap let's do no wrap
75:34 - all right to make sure it's not wrapped
75:35 - because i like the fact that it's
75:36 - wrapping like you know
75:37 - and so forth um i think it's just no
75:39 - wrap like this i feel like that
75:44 - ah maybe i'm wrong anyways so here's
75:46 - what we got so far which is pretty good
75:48 - all right um a few different things i
75:50 - want us to focus on as well
75:55 - what we're going to do is we're going to
75:56 - make this menu basically a full width so
75:58 - flex one
75:59 - so by giving a flex one we're giving it
76:01 - a full kind of weight
76:04 - flex one and then if i say something
76:06 - like this for example if i say just the
76:07 - content center check this out justify
76:09 - content
76:15 - boom i'll justify content
76:20 - center what happens here
76:24 - no nothing ah
76:27 - justify content align item center
76:31 - let me see here container display flex
76:34 - let me make sure it's all good
76:40 - why is it not doing so justify content
76:44 - center flex 1
76:48 - why is it not because here's the goal i
76:50 - wanted to also fully
76:52 - be the full width here so if i do
76:54 - inspect element let's see what happens
76:55 - happening here right now
76:57 - okay we have this oh it's actually not
76:58 - the full width it's unfortunate
77:02 - it's actually because this is not the
77:03 - full width oh so you see this right here
77:05 - this is why inspector is so important
77:07 - sometimes guys you see
77:08 - the full header is not the full width of
77:10 - the actual page now to make that happen
77:12 - it's pretty easy actually
77:14 - check this one out try this one out so
77:16 - to make that happen
77:17 - all we have to do is the following
77:20 - um is we give it right here so this
77:23 - container you see this container
77:25 - the header is i do the following i say
77:27 - top 0
77:29 - right that will stick it to the to the
77:31 - zero to the top okay that's
77:33 - left zero we'll stick it to the left
77:36 - okay
77:37 - now right zero is we'll stick it to the
77:40 - right
77:40 - meaning it will expand you see right
77:43 - there it says what happened
77:44 - it will expand the header with the full
77:46 - width
77:48 - that's what just happened you see that
77:49 - right there the header is the full width
77:51 - how cool is that right how cool is that
77:54 - so that's what just happened so now we
77:56 - have these specific models okay
77:58 - great the last the next thing you need
78:00 - to work on is going to be what
78:02 - well uh that's gonna be uh
78:06 - this shop tesla account let's go ahead
78:07 - and make that one happen too so that's
78:09 - pretty easy as well
78:10 - and again some of this stuff is also
78:11 - going to be like we'll change it up
78:13 - later on to make sure
78:14 - it's actually like you know the menu is
78:16 - right so now we'll do
78:18 - the right menu
78:22 - right menu right menu
78:26 - okay and inside the right manual
78:28 - there'll be a few different things we'll
78:30 - have
78:31 - first it will have ahref
78:34 - is equal to what let me go ahead and
78:36 - actually
78:39 - i think this shouldn't be p i think we
78:41 - should remove this stuff
78:42 - i think this should be just a tags
78:45 - honestly
78:48 - that's something in here same thing with
78:50 - this
78:51 - boom remove this just so we have an a
78:53 - tag there's no reason to have all these
78:54 - p tags so we just will consistent
78:56 - throughout the whole thing okay
78:57 - and you can use command d to make sure
78:58 - it's all consistent okay
79:01 - so ahref and uh it's gonna be nothing of
79:03 - course
79:04 - and this will be a shop okay
79:09 - okay next one's gonna be a shrap
79:13 - a shrap is gonna be equal to what
79:18 - is equal to each draft is equal to which
79:22 - one which is
79:23 - actually tesla account so let's go ahead
79:25 - and do that will be
79:29 - tesla account
79:32 - good good good good and the last thing
79:34 - we need to do is we need an icon that's
79:36 - like a burger icon
79:37 - right here so we'll do that in a second
79:39 - here but first i'm going to focus on the
79:41 - right menu that's what i want to focus
79:43 - on for a second here okay
79:44 - so let's do right menu so
79:47 - save that of course we have that does
79:50 - not define right now so that's not a
79:52 - problem whatsoever
79:53 - so we'll do menus this menu okay
79:58 - so we'll do a tag here instead of p make
80:01 - sure you're targeting a tag now at this
80:02 - point you see
80:04 - okay good all right let's go ahead and
80:06 - do const
80:07 - right menu is equal to what style
80:11 - dot div that's all it is
80:14 - okay um let's see here
80:18 - right menu is not defined yes it is you
80:20 - just need to refresh it
80:22 - there we go all right same thing we can
80:24 - do also the same thing on this one and
80:26 - also target
80:27 - the actual individual what the
80:29 - individual a tags
80:30 - using something like this
80:33 - boom you see
80:37 - save it hey let's go beautiful all right
80:41 - so that's that's pretty good i kind of
80:43 - like that so let's find way 600
80:45 - textures from uppercase on the right
80:47 - menu
80:48 - padding let's go don't think i will
80:49 - remove probably is going to be like the
80:51 - the padding
80:54 - and also i'll do do margin margin right
80:59 - 10 pixels so now the sharpness are kind
81:02 - of more closer that's the only thing
81:04 - i'll do at this point and then let's go
81:06 - ahead and remove this donate this
81:09 - okay good i like that um the only thing
81:11 - that's pretty much
81:12 - we need to do is let's see let's see

86:29 - good this
86:29 - look already look at this guys this is
86:33 - sick this is amazing so proud about
86:36 - one thing i want to change you see how
86:37 - this model actually gets squished well
86:39 - we're going to
86:40 - make the change that you know whenever
86:41 - you get to a small screen you just
86:43 - remove it now to remove it again
86:46 - how do we do the last time we're also
86:48 - going to use uh media queries just how
86:50 - we did the last time right
86:52 - and with media queries it's pretty
86:53 - simple you just do like this
86:55 - try this out so on the menu group on the
86:58 - menu
86:59 - on the menu right here so we'll say what
87:01 - media
87:02 - again max with us 768 pixels
87:06 - meaning basically when we get to 768
87:09 - pixels
87:10 - browser width we say display none on the
87:12 - full thing so save that
87:14 - boom right there see oh let's go
87:17 - boom now what's happening here you see
87:18 - that shot past the account for some
87:20 - reason is doing this thing where it's
87:22 - like
87:22 - going all the way to the left hand side
87:24 - and we can fix that
87:26 - by what go into the container and
87:29 - currently we say
87:30 - align item center but to make them space
87:33 - out we say justify content
87:37 - content and then we'll just space
87:38 - between that's it
87:44 - wind there we go
87:46 - look at that oh oh oh yeah
87:49 - there we go so beautiful
87:53 - i love it so how cool

88:11 - page it has like this really slick
88:14 - animation
88:16 - and it's pretty cool i kind of like it
88:18 - you guys want to install the animation
88:20 - i think so too so how do we make this
88:22 - animation works it's going to use it
88:23 - called react reveal
88:24 - check this out react
88:28 - reveal and all this is just a module
88:31 - it's basically just a module for react
88:34 - uh for
88:35 - animation library you see this
88:40 - pretty much anything you want i mean we
88:42 - can even use different effects if you if
88:44 - you wanted to
88:45 - there's a zoom effect and so to
88:46 - creationally add a fade effect it's
88:48 - pretty simple
88:49 - you just you know you install react
88:51 - reveal like so
88:53 - right and then you do what then you do
88:56 - basically you add not zoom but you do
89:00 - see where's the fade i want to do fade

89:13 - that's pretty cool
89:14 - um if i have my model s here no
89:17 - matter why yeah that's cool
89:20 - all right so open up in terminal

93:10 - inventory we have used inventory
93:13 - right for example used inventory we have
93:16 - for example trade-in
93:19 - right trade uh trade
93:22 - dash in you know and so forth and so
93:25 - forth let's go ahead and maybe modify
93:27 - some of these
93:28 - right here babies oh the cyber truck
93:30 - who's excited for that one
93:33 - cyber truck right here
93:37 - there's maybe the roadster that's a
93:38 - pretty cool one too
93:42 - right there and so what we're building
93:44 - right now is pretty much the following
93:45 - right
93:46 - we're building this menu boom this menu
93:49 - on the right hand side that's our
93:50 - building right there
93:51 - oh this money on the right-hand side
93:53 - everything else will build now we just
93:54 - need to go ahead and focus on that one
93:56 - okay
93:57 - uh you can see these where they have
93:58 - model x use inventory that's just pretty
94:00 - much those items right there
94:01 - all right awesome sweet so we got that
94:03 - portion that's so good
94:05 - um and the burger nav of course is not
94:07 - existing right now so we need to create
94:08 - that
94:09 - so we'll say const const what
94:13 - const burger nav
94:17 - burger now is equal to what burgernav is
94:20 - equal to
94:23 - styled.div
94:27 - right there all right oh that looks
94:30 - hideous
94:31 - don't worry about it guys okay so don't
94:33 - worry about this so the burger now
94:36 - right now uh let's go ahead and do the
94:38 - following we'll just put it on top of
94:40 - everything else that's that's kind of
94:41 - needed all right
94:43 - um so for one it's gonna be position
94:47 - fixed so
94:48 - position fixed
94:52 - why because it's always in the top no
94:54 - matter what
94:55 - right it's always gonna be where on the
94:57 - right hand side
94:59 - right always going to be here no matter
95:00 - what page you're on okay
95:02 - so there's no fixed now where i'm going
95:05 - to say top 0
95:06 - right i'm going to say bottom 0 to
95:08 - stretch it over to the bottom
95:10 - and then i'm going to say right 0.
95:14 - that will take it all to the right hand
95:15 - side boom
95:18 - okay you see now to the right hand zero
95:20 - good next all right
95:22 - at this point let's go into background
95:24 - color
95:25 - back background
95:30 - white nice you see so it's kind of
95:33 - getting there a little bit all right
95:35 - so it's background white let's give it a
95:37 - width
95:38 - width oh 300 pixels
95:42 - good nice okay i like it good good good
95:45 - let's also give the z index because
95:47 - obviously it's like kind of like
95:48 - i think it's kind of like the index
95:52 - so does the index of like 10 100
95:58 - let's see is it 100 um i think it's
96:01 - because
96:02 - in that case we need to go ahead and
96:03 - make everything else is the index of
96:05 - smaller that's what we need to do in
96:07 - that case so that means that
96:10 - everything else oh man that's a lot
96:15 - okay so the whole section now let's do
96:18 - this let's go to section how
96:20 - and this right here will say z index
96:27 - index of 10 let's just say
96:31 - would that change anything because i
96:34 - want this to be on top
96:36 - you see what i mean i want it to be on
96:38 - top is what i'm trying to get to
96:40 - let's think about it here
96:41 - [Music]
96:47 - the index 10 that's gonna be maybe
96:49 - negative one
96:54 - negative one no that's not at the index
96:57 - of
96:58 - let's just say the index of ten
97:02 - so what's what's being overwritten so
97:04 - let's see
97:08 - okay let's see let's see let's see let's
97:09 - see so well for one is the item text so
97:11 - i think we need to focus on item text
97:13 - here
97:13 - so let's do item text
97:16 - let's do this one it's gonna be z index
97:20 - it's gonna be 10. come on give me
97:24 - something
97:31 - so item text z x minus one
97:38 - does that mean the home just needs to
97:39 - have a smaller z index i'm just trying
97:41 - to think here guys what do you guys
97:42 - think here
97:42 - so home maybe this is going to be easy
97:44 - index of 10 maybe
97:49 - no did not change nothing
97:52 - okay let's see how do we go ahead and
97:55 - make sure that this kind of works the
97:56 - way i wanted to so z index of 10 what do
97:58 - you guys think you have any suggestions
98:00 - and we have any suggestions sometimes
98:03 - refresh no
98:08 - home 10 it's max but do 10 for
98:11 - sidebar okay so for sidebar let's try
98:14 - that for the header
98:16 - for the burger now let's try that
98:20 - i mean i can't do anything like
98:25 - let's see still not nothing
98:30 - [Music]
98:39 - [Music]
98:42 - how do we fix the z-index issue
98:47 - the index of let's try this the init of
98:49 - 16.
98:54 - i'm just thinking here let's see easy
98:56 - index
99:01 - oh maybe it's this other contain really
99:04 - let's see
99:05 - if i go to here and i say this container
99:07 - is z
99:08 - index of one
99:12 - oh what the heck oh
99:16 - that makes sense oh
99:21 - so we actually so it was competing the
99:23 - weight was competing not with everything
99:25 - else
99:26 - it was actually competing with the
99:28 - actual header which is the container
99:31 - which is above it because this remember
99:33 - this broken app is within
99:35 - this so in order to have this show up
99:38 - above this the container we need to give
99:41 - this as small as the index
99:42 - and give this one a zenith of like 16
99:44 - let's say okay that makes sense okay so
99:46 - there we go
99:47 - all right so cool we kind of got that
99:48 - that's pretty awesome
99:50 - i kind of like that don't you agree okay
99:53 - so
99:54 - now let's go ahead and focus on
99:57 - we have the index
100:01 - okay let's do the burger now and
100:04 - top zero with that's good that's good
100:07 - now
100:08 - okay let's go ahead and remove this list
100:09 - out because it's horrible list
100:11 - style it'll be none
100:15 - okay good next
100:19 - let's do padding 20 pixels
100:23 - to give it some padding all around
100:26 - good nice nice nice nice nice nice
100:32 - nice okay paint 20 pixels
100:36 - then let's go ahead and do the following
100:38 - then we'll do
100:39 - back around no no no
100:43 - so the list style is kind of like not
100:45 - the way i wanted to because
100:47 - why because it's centered which is not
100:50 - what i like
100:52 - so to make that work i just do display
100:54 - flex on this one
100:56 - just place the display flags on this
100:58 - puppy there we go
101:00 - good and then we'll do flight direction
101:02 - column
101:07 - got there ah it's still okay don't worry
101:11 - and then uh we'll do what flex
101:14 - um justify content
101:18 - justify content
101:22 - okay flex
101:25 - start good oh like this
101:30 - like justify content really come on
101:34 - really nothing is it text online
101:38 - text align what
101:42 - start okay never mind you don't need
101:45 - this livestream column in that case
101:49 - i mean that could still be useful
101:50 - actually but we don't need this one
101:53 - so texas line start which is good which
101:55 - i like okay
101:56 - uh let's see where are we at so on this
101:59 - one we have model
102:00 - three model s okay i like that so
102:03 - now let's go ahead and focus on each
102:04 - line so li
102:07 - okay so a lie on this one we'll do the
102:10 - following
102:11 - on this a line we'll do
102:14 - so we'll have padding top and bottom
102:16 - padding 15 pixels for every single one
102:19 - and then left and right is gonna be zero
102:20 - for now okay
102:22 - and we'll give it a border bottom
102:26 - boom right there good okay
102:30 - good and we'll give it a tag so on the
102:32 - let's go ahead and see
102:35 - let's see now oh let's go that looks
102:38 - good that looks good okay i like it i
102:40 - like it i like it
102:41 - let's go ahead and give it and
102:44 - the tag let's just give it a more of a
102:47 - font weight so we'll do font weight
102:50 - weight font weight
102:54 - by the way we're almost at a thousand
102:56 - likes guys
102:57 - come on let's get this party started
103:00 - fund weight 600
103:02 - good ay let's go
103:05 - now of course now the thing you need to
103:07 - work on is how do you actually make it
103:08 - work so that it actually shows up
103:09 - properly you know what i mean because
103:10 - right now
103:11 - it's just kind of there right so right
103:13 - now it's just kind of there
103:15 - um yeah it's top right bottom zero you
103:18 - know
103:18 - and how we need to hide it somehow so
103:20 - how do we hide it well for one let's go
103:22 - ahead and add an x button
103:23 - so in the material ui icons
103:27 - it's going to find a find material icon
103:29 - so let's do
103:30 - material ui icons
103:36 - material
103:38 - let's find an x button
103:45 - x
103:49 - there we go close okay good exactly what
103:52 - we want so close icon
103:54 - all right
103:58 - all right oh look how good this is guys
104:00 - oh my god it's so good
104:01 - okay let's go ahead and import our close
104:03 - button here
104:05 - okay so inside the broker nav we'll
104:07 - create we'll actually go ahead and do
104:09 - this close button right here
104:11 - oops oops so we'll do
104:15 - um we'll do what custom close so we'll
104:19 - say this
104:19 - custom close custom close so it's going
104:22 - to create a custom close button
104:23 - and how we're going to do that well by
104:25 - using style components
104:26 - so let's go here
104:29 - const custom
104:33 - close is equal to what styled
104:38 - uh no
104:41 - styled what let's see style
104:44 - close icon
104:48 - right there
104:53 - there we go close icon
105:00 - good
105:05 - nice okay good gotta go i like it okay
105:08 - uh
105:08 - let's need to actually make sure this
105:10 - one gets aligned
105:11 - not there but actually somewhere else so
105:15 - to do this one we'll do let's see let's
105:17 - see let's see
105:18 - just kind of thinking here and this one
105:23 - we need to wrap it in that case so let's
105:24 - do
105:26 - we'll create a closed wrapper close
105:29 - wrapper
105:32 - because we need to actually shift this
105:34 - to the right hand side right so if i go
105:35 - ahead and do it this way
105:37 - so i'll get this bishop to here right we
105:39 - need to put that here
105:40 - you know to shift that properly how is
105:42 - it going to work well
105:44 - to shift it properly right i'm going to
105:46 - create a div around it a wrapper
105:48 - and then display flex it and put it here
105:51 - that's i'm going to create it okay
105:52 - just so you know that's a pretty good
105:53 - way of doing this kind of stuff right
105:55 - so just so you know custom close okay
105:59 - so if you want to like align something
106:01 - remember this
106:02 - rule wrap it if you want to align
106:04 - something
106:05 - wrap it you need to there's always need
106:07 - to be a parent wrapper in order to align
106:09 - something vertically horizontally left
106:11 - right whatever might have to be right
106:14 - okay close wrapper let's go ahead and
106:16 - create that close wrapper right here
106:19 - okay so close wrapper so const close
106:24 - wrapper is equal to styled dot div
106:29 - now look at this one now you see check
106:31 - this one out
106:32 - okay all i do at this point is very
106:34 - simple i say the following i say
106:37 - display flex
106:40 - flex and here's what i do check this one
106:43 - out
106:44 - okay let's play flex and we'll say
106:47 - um justify content
106:53 - content what flex end
106:58 - boom right there see just as simple as
107:01 - that that's it and now that's there
107:03 - okay next up let's go ahead and do the
107:04 - following we'll do um
107:06 - let's do on the actual custom close
107:09 - we'll do what
107:10 - cursor pointer
107:13 - pointer save that nice
107:17 - right there there you go beautiful
107:19 - beautiful
107:20 - good good good good good
107:24 - awesome sweet look at this oh my gosh
107:27 - this looks good guys this looks so good
107:29 - all right who's still with me you guys
107:31 - still with me i hope so
107:33 - let's go all right all right so we got
107:36 - this portion now we need to figure out
107:37 - how do we close it well
107:39 - we're going to use use state to make
107:40 - sure that we understand when is there
107:42 - when there is a closing factor or when
107:44 - there is an open factor right so
107:47 - for example
107:52 - let's go and do this let's use your
107:54 - state to figure out
107:56 - when i click on this i'm going to
107:58 - trigger a use state to say hey
108:00 - you know i'll close it right if i open
108:04 - it
108:04 - i'm going to say that we have an open
108:05 - state now that's what's going to happen
108:07 - now okay
108:08 - so let's do this i'm going to say you
108:11 - stay it's going to open
108:12 - import you state here
108:15 - use state beautiful
108:18 - okay all right nice nice nice nice and
108:21 - at this point you just feel a few very
108:23 - simple things okay
108:25 - god this is so clean guys by the way
108:27 - such a clean such clean coat which i
108:29 - really love by the way
108:30 - all right so we have use state and the
108:32 - site here let's do the following
108:34 - boom and we'll do const here i'm going
108:37 - to create our use state so we'll say
108:39 - burger status so for the burger i'll say
108:43 - open
108:45 - burger open or
108:48 - sat um
108:51 - said i'll just say booger status i think
108:53 - it's good i kind of like that one
108:55 - status right there and with a set burger
108:59 - status at brooker
109:01 - stat this right there it's equal to what
109:04 - use
109:06 - state initially we'll set it to false so
109:08 - right now
109:09 - right now it's actually closed so story
109:12 - status is closed
109:13 - right there right so that's what's going
109:15 - to happen okay so process is closed
109:17 - now how do we go ahead and make sure
109:20 - that you know that this stuff is
109:22 - actually
109:22 - closed or open well very simple is
109:26 - what we can do is the following so look
109:28 - at this on the burger nav i'm going to
109:29 - pass in a wrapper here i'll pass in a
109:31 - parameter here
109:32 - and this can be show is equal to the
109:34 - status of the burger status
109:36 - say burger status burger status right
109:39 - there
109:41 - i guess that is inside the burger now
109:44 - we're gonna have all i'm going to do is
109:47 - check this one out i'm gonna say for
109:51 - example here
109:54 - um if we have
109:57 - so look at this one i'm going to
109:59 - transform it some say transform
110:03 - check this one out transform okay
110:06 - i'm going to look for the prop so props
110:09 - like so
110:10 - but we just have done before and
110:12 - basically here's what we'll say
110:13 - if if it says prop start show
110:19 - props dot show right
110:22 - it basically says props or show we're
110:23 - going to do what
110:26 - transform you know nothing so here's
110:29 - what we'll do
110:30 - we'll do ifssprops.show we'll just make
110:33 - it
110:33 - you know show basically um
110:36 - translate x0 so here's what we'll do so
110:39 - translate
110:41 - translate x oh it needs to be like this
110:45 - right here
110:47 - translate x 0
110:50 - and what does that do so if i go to
110:52 - translate x
110:53 - go ahead and do it this way otherwise
110:58 - we'll do translate x 100
111:02 - translate x
111:06 - 100 okay
111:10 - okay let's see so right now it's false
111:12 - okay
111:13 - oh now it's false okay so what just
111:17 - happened
111:17 - let me see and make sure it's all good
111:19 - let me see i think i need to actually
111:22 - go hey let's go so now
111:25 - now look you see so right now translate
111:27 - x
111:28 - basically if it's show we have translate
111:30 - x0 so translate x what does that
111:32 - what does that pretty much do um let me
111:34 - go and show it to you
111:37 - tran is late x
111:42 - right here look at this one guys this is
111:46 - pretty cool
111:46 - right so i can move something basically
111:53 - so right here for example i can
111:55 - translate x 10 pixels i'm going to
111:57 - translate 10 pixels to the right hand
111:58 - side
111:59 - right and so
112:02 - what's gonna happen is
112:06 - is the following
112:12 - if i go ahead and actually if i do for
112:16 - example if i do show and i say here
112:18 - a hundred percent
112:21 - boom let's go and see this
112:25 - see this see this
112:28 - props does show is it working at all
112:30 - let's see am i missing something
112:32 - um processor should be false if it's
112:36 - false i think it should be translate
112:37 - zero yes yes yes yes yes
112:40 - there you go so let's get this out so
112:43 - this will do
112:44 - if props does show basically we're not
112:46 - part of the show is false right now of
112:47 - course
112:48 - so what's gonna happen is it's going to
112:49 - translate what
112:51 - zero it won't move it at all right
112:54 - right so that's going to happen if it's
112:56 - false it won't
112:58 - move it at all that's that's that's
112:59 - that's kind of what happened of course
113:01 - but
113:01 - we're going to say this if it's false
113:03 - what happens actually if it's true
113:04 - if it's if we say props dot show right
113:08 - then we actually need to move it not
113:10 - nothing because basically we do nothing
113:12 - right so if it's
113:13 - true we don't do nothing to this right
113:16 - this stays the way it should be
113:18 - right but the second this is false
113:22 - this is false we need to move to the
113:24 - right hand side
113:25 - it's full width right here see that's
113:27 - why he shows it that way
113:29 - now check this out what we can do now at
113:31 - this point
113:32 - is we can have another click so when i
113:34 - go ahead and i click
113:36 - open so this come on click button so
113:38 - unclick
113:39 - unclick is equal to what
113:43 - right tata when i say
113:47 - right well i'm going to say what i'm
113:49 - going to do the following
113:52 - i'm going to say sad broker status to
113:55 - true
113:58 - that is to true so set it to true
114:03 - okay true so means if i click on this i
114:06 - know icon
114:07 - set the progress status to be true minis
114:08 - mini open so let's try this right now
114:11 - oh look at that see that means open
114:14 - right there
114:15 - how cool is that that means open okay
114:17 - now closes now work right now because of
114:18 - course close nothing right
114:20 - so now to actually change that to make
114:21 - that fully happen
114:23 - what to do on the on the click of this
114:26 - one
114:27 - what we're going to say is equal to
114:31 - what boom we'll say what
114:38 - status what cyborg status to what
114:43 - to false
114:46 - there we go look at this now right so
114:48 - now we change it to false
114:50 - i'll do this
114:56 - how cool is this guys burger status is
114:59 - now officially
115:01 - what officially now true or false now
115:04 - again this is where
115:05 - we now make it very beautiful look at
115:06 - this one let's go ahead and make it very
115:07 - beautiful now okay
115:09 - guys how good is it starting to look
115:11 - aren't you aren't you pumped aren't you
115:12 - like
115:13 - like excited for this and by the way
115:15 - we're almost at a thousand likes guys
115:17 - 977 let's go ahead and make sure we have
115:20 - that you know let's get to 1k
115:22 - it's not that much come on you guys got
115:23 - this it's been working really hard now
115:28 - all right so that's good 977 likes let's
115:31 - go
115:32 - all right to make it flow very nicely we
115:35 - just add a small transition tool check
115:37 - this out you see this transform
115:39 - all i do is look transition i say the
115:43 - following
115:44 - transition trend
115:47 - position and i do what on the transform
115:51 - factor
115:54 - transitions form and i will say what 0.2
115:57 - seconds
115:59 - i'm gonna say ease in right
116:03 - now you ready for this my friend are you
116:05 - ready for
116:07 - the reveal all right
116:12 - oh
116:14 - look at that boom boom boom boom
116:18 - boom i kind of want to make it even
116:20 - better though i kind of want to make it
116:22 - look even better let me see
116:25 - let's see i want to say ease and ease
116:26 - out
116:28 - i will say easing is
116:31 - dash out i don't like that better
116:35 - no here oh that's not it hold on um
116:41 - let's see
116:45 - there we go much better i like
116:48 - oh let's go that looks so good
116:52 - how cool is that guys let's go ahead
116:55 - and give us a thumbs up for the
116:57 - following and we're at a thousand likes
117:00 - you guys are amazing as always just want
117:01 - to say
117:03 - something easy now thank you hey
117:06 - let's go
117:11 - how cool is that
117:15 - beautiful it looks so good
117:20 - okay now let's go ahead and actually add
117:21 - some data to this right we're going to
117:22 - add some redux to this
117:24 - all right but pretty much look at this
117:25 - we're almost pretty much done we're so
117:27 - close to finishing this a tesla clone
117:29 - uh it's so clean the the code is clean
117:31 - that's the really cool part about this
117:33 - all right
117:33 - um a few things now we're gonna do is
117:36 - the following
117:37 - let's go ahead and add some data to it
117:39 - about like our cars right so
117:41 - as you can see here we have for example
117:44 - you know we might have cars for example
117:46 - car titles so here for example
117:48 - model s and so forth right model asmr
117:52 - and so forth now let's go ahead and
117:55 - create
117:56 - uh our redux store that will contain the
117:59 - cars that
118:00 - we will be using here okay we'll be
118:02 - using here so
118:03 - here's what we'll do let's go ahead and
118:06 - look at the redux the component that we
118:07 - need to create so let's go features
118:09 - and the one that we have currently is
118:11 - like a weird one that's like a counter
118:13 - feature we don't need that one at all so
118:15 - we can actually fix that one let's go
118:17 - put it at the hand side we can't fix
118:18 - that one
118:19 - um don't get the counter instead let's
118:21 - go ahead and create a new folder on the
118:22 - features folder
118:24 - and let's call it for example car slice
118:28 - car slice right there okay counter you
118:31 - can remove that one so let's go ahead
118:33 - right click um
118:36 - delete move to trash
118:40 - now we only just have car slices that's
118:42 - nothing we need so inside the car so
118:43 - let's go ahead create new file
118:45 - and what
118:49 - actually now let's do let's see uh let's
118:52 - rename this to car
118:54 - rename this to car not car slice car and
118:57 - inside here we'll create a new file
118:58 - called car slice car
119:00 - slice dot gs beautiful okay
119:05 - all right let's go to our app go to
119:07 - store and remove this counter reducer
119:08 - because we don't need that one okay
119:11 - okay good on the counter slice
119:15 - on the car slice all right we need to of
119:18 - course
119:18 - import redux toolkit so let's go ahead
119:20 - and read the import redux toolkit for
119:22 - create
119:24 - create slice and what slice is is
119:26 - basically in redux is
119:28 - imagine reading is like this whole state
119:30 - of data that you have right imagine
119:31 - redux is like
119:32 - for example you know where this is this
119:34 - whole state right
119:35 - and the slice is just one smaller state
119:38 - right one small one piece of the state
119:40 - so in our case our slice will be for
119:42 - example just car for now
119:43 - and that's why it's called slices right
119:45 - it's like a slight slice of pizza
119:47 - right and every single for example when
119:49 - you're trying to save data
119:51 - in the global state of the whole website
119:53 - right you might have a car slice you
119:54 - might have an inventory slice who know
119:56 - for example right
119:57 - inventory you know and so forth and so
119:59 - forth and all that is just data that's
120:01 - shared
120:02 - across all your web pages websites
120:05 - all your pages on your site that's
120:07 - pretty much it okay
120:08 - so let me create a slice that's what's
120:10 - happening here
120:11 - all right beautiful let's go ahead and
120:14 - go next
120:15 - the next one we'll go ahead and do is
120:17 - we've got the car slice that's great
120:19 - um let's
120:22 - create initial state so we'll do const
120:24 - initial
120:26 - state and we'll give it a few cars so
120:28 - we'll say
120:29 - um
120:33 - cars i'm giving the cars right here
120:37 - and this will be actually an array of
120:38 - objects x just
120:40 - actually just honestly just an array of
120:42 - cars so say for example
120:44 - model which one what do we have
120:47 - model s model three
120:51 - right model s model 3 model x model y so
120:55 - model s
120:58 - model s model 3
121:02 - okay model x
121:07 - model x and then model y
121:16 - model y there we go all right so we got
121:19 - ourselves the cars
121:22 - okay let's go ahead and now get this car
121:27 - so
121:27 - to create the actual slice we'll do
121:29 - const
121:31 - car slice car slice
121:36 - is equal to what's going to create the
121:37 - slice right we'll create a slice of
121:38 - pizza right
121:39 - create slice right there and that takes
121:43 - a few different things the amount
121:44 - we're going to name it let's name the
121:45 - slice right there this could be car
121:47 - for now okay and then we'll give an
121:50 - initial state
121:53 - and then she'll state right there
121:57 - okay and then we'll give a few reduces
121:59 - now we don't need any reducers at this
122:01 - point right because our goal right now
122:02 - is just to get the cars that's it so
122:04 - we don't need anything like that of that
122:05 - sort that's way too complicated
122:08 - instead once that well what we will
122:10 - however do is we'll get the cars
122:11 - themselves so say export const
122:14 - and the trajectory or how usually you do
122:18 - it inside slices inside without toolkit
122:20 - is you for example do select so it's
122:22 - like selecting a piece of
122:24 - object selecting a piece of data so in
122:26 - our case i'm selecting cars
122:27 - right here okay is equal to what is
122:31 - equal to state
122:33 - is equal state and then it's going to
122:35 - return to me
122:37 - this will turn to be the state state.car
122:41 - the car is the name of the slice right
122:43 - here dot cars
122:45 - that's it that's going to be this right
122:46 - here that's with this whole array that's
122:48 - pretty much it
122:48 - okay so this right here is mapping
122:51 - directly
122:52 - to this right here and select cars will
122:55 - have that for us
122:56 - that's it and of course we're going to
122:59 - export now
123:00 - default uh
123:04 - we could ask for the reducer because we
123:05 - need to actually access some kind of
123:07 - reducer even though it's empty
123:09 - default and we'll say car slice
123:12 - dot reducer
123:15 - beautiful nice all right once we've got
123:17 - that we need to actually import this
123:19 - let's go ahead
123:20 - and go to store and we'll do import
123:26 - import and this will be the car reducer
123:29 - so we'll say
123:30 - car car reducer
123:33 - right here from what
123:36 - okay we need to go back now we need to
123:39 - go into
123:39 - features let me go ahead let me see this
123:41 - i need to go back
123:42 - let me go into features right here and
123:45 - for that we need to go into the car
123:47 - right there
123:49 - car um and then we go car slice
123:52 - beautiful right there
123:53 - and so instead of this kind of reducer
123:54 - we just change it to car reducer car is
123:56 - gonna be car
123:57 - reducer right there right so
124:00 - that's pretty much all you have to do on
124:02 - the redux reducer side
124:04 - okay so just keep that in mind always
124:05 - okay guys uh you know
124:07 - the store you tell what producers you
124:09 - have okay
124:11 - the slice is basically every individual
124:13 - reducer you can see right individual
124:15 - slice and this contains the actions
124:17 - and i'm not going to go deep into redux
124:19 - of course that there will be another
124:21 - video of itself
124:22 - um but redux there's always a few
124:25 - different things
124:26 - we also have we always have the initial
124:28 - state that's a state that you will have
124:29 - when you initially start the application
124:31 - and you will have reducers and reduce
124:32 - strategically just functions you can use
124:34 - to manipulate the state
124:37 - maybe you have a function that will add
124:38 - a new car you know or something
124:40 - something else so that's what kind of
124:42 - the redux reducer is there for
124:44 - right there's also actions but we'll
124:46 - talk about those later
124:48 - most important thing is the fact that we
124:50 - have select cars which will get us the
124:52 - cars individually okay
124:54 - nice okay so all right at this point
124:57 - we are pretty much almost done let's go
125:00 - to home.gs
125:01 - and what we need to do is the following
125:04 - let's go to section here section here uh
125:07 - no
125:07 - actually not here uh header
125:12 - header right here we're going to import
125:15 - our
125:16 - car slice so so let's go import import
125:21 - okay and we'll say select cars right
125:23 - this will give us the actual car select
125:26 - cars from
125:30 - from what from
125:35 - features right here slash car
125:38 - slash car slice good and
125:41 - we need to actually import you selector
125:43 - so in order to select something that's
125:45 - usually something called the use
125:46 - selector which is a hook which is a
125:48 - react hook
125:48 - right here good
125:52 - good right here so you selector and then
125:55 - we're going to select the actual car so
125:56 - we'll say
125:57 - const cars is equal to what
126:01 - use selector from what
126:05 - well select cars
126:08 - boom done you see that's it right we've
126:11 - started the cars from the actual use
126:13 - selector right
126:14 - so if we now console.log it that's going
126:15 - to consolidate the cars
126:20 - cars okay console login right now let's
126:24 - go ahead and right click inspect down on
126:25 - this one
126:28 - console
126:34 - let's go ahead and see how this works
126:36 - out let's go ahead and refresh it
126:39 - it says legacy context api has been
126:41 - deducted within this restrict mode 3
126:43 - don't worry about this one but look at
126:44 - this here it is model s model 3 model x
126:47 - y beautiful that's all we need to do
126:49 - let's see
126:50 - this is some fade stuff we don't need to
126:52 - do this one should mitigate to the new
126:54 - version all the piano will be 24 that's
126:55 - fine
126:56 - right so right there here's our array
126:59 - and now all we do is
127:00 - for example for this which so now here
127:04 - as we'll do if cars
127:07 - cars and and
127:11 - cars dot map
127:15 - right i'm gonna get the individual car
127:21 - car and then i'm gonna get the index
127:28 - boom done all right
127:31 - enter karma the index and then that's
127:34 - gonna give us what
127:40 - okay good so then i will go ahead and do
127:44 - a shrap doom
127:48 - right here i will give it
127:51 - some kind of a thing like this
127:56 - okay that closes that beautiful there we
128:00 - go so model s
128:01 - okay now check this out all we gotta do
128:03 - now at this point is just
128:04 - give it a car ah
128:08 - oops car and i can remove this now
128:13 - done so now
128:17 - let's see oh let's go
128:21 - another thing we want to figure out is
128:22 - give the key
128:24 - so because if i right clicked inspect
128:25 - them on this one
128:27 - the console here see it says each child
128:30 - in the list should have a unique key the
128:31 - reason why they do that is because
128:34 - react actually tracks individual child
128:36 - by the key so let's say any changes
128:38 - happened
128:39 - it will know where to make those changes
128:41 - i'm going to do that by using the index
128:43 - like this right there see
128:46 - so if i inspect them but now okay
128:49 - the console and let's go ahead i refresh
128:51 - this again
128:53 - see the child is no longer that issue is
128:55 - no longer there beautiful
128:57 - let's remove this console of cars guys
128:58 - we're almost done
129:00 - so close to being done and finishing up
129:03 - this tesla
129:04 - clone that is pretty pretty insane i
129:07 - will say
129:08 - all right and the next thing i'm going
129:09 - to do is i'm we'll do the same thing
129:11 - with this specific situation here
129:13 - with this cars and i'll put in here
129:17 - cars that map but in my case i'm going
129:19 - to use it like this
129:22 - boom and this will be the actual car
129:24 - itself
129:26 - car right there and again a lie and then
129:29 - we're going to give it a key
129:31 - is equal to the actual index boom boom
129:34 - boom boom don't need any of this stuff
129:39 - boom right here that's that's it and so
129:42 - this is going to be that let's go ahead
129:44 - and take a look at that one so cars down
129:46 - map
129:47 - so let's go see oh
129:50 - would you look at that
129:53 - guys look at what we have
129:57 - got for ourselves let's go ahead and do
130:00 - add
130:01 - and that's going to be uh redux for cars
130:04 - right there but yes
130:07 - cut b look at
130:10 - what we have got four ourselves
130:14 - whoo oh my god look at that guys
130:18 - look at this model s model three we have
130:21 - some beautiful animations look at that
130:23 - oh my god two two two two
130:27 - all this stuff and if you compare it to
130:29 - an actual tesla page
130:30 - i mean let's go ahead and take a look at
130:32 - the tesla page actual tesla page
130:35 - let's take a look at it here look at
130:37 - that like
130:39 - what like okay just compare it here
130:42 - like hold on look look like what
130:45 - guys do you see the magic that we have
130:49 - just done
130:52 - like can you tell the difference i mean
130:54 - yes we have this fancy
130:55 - feature like the scrolling feature we
130:57 - can work on that later but
130:59 - look it's there
131:02 - i actually hate i actually hate this
131:03 - kind of um slim
131:05 - features or like where they you know
131:07 - they don't allow you to scroll i hate
131:08 - that
131:09 - oh let's go look at oh my god
131:13 - how good is this guys this
131:16 - is so fresh so clean
131:19 - you know it uh guys that is pretty
131:22 - pretty insane
131:25 - wow wow wow looking dope nas jessica's

131:34 - we've got like i said
131:35 - we've got everything we finished the
131:37 - application it looks so good it looks
131:39 - clean model s
131:40 - model y model three model x
131:43 - guys you put this on your portfolio it's
131:45 - gonna be a winning portfolio for
131:46 - yourself
131:47 - this is going to be a winning portfolio

Cleaned transcript:

what is up everybody this is nas from clevver programmer and today i know you're already i know you're excited we are building the tesla cologne check out this amazing tesla clone here's what we got here it is a teslacon web page you guys know teslas are amazing uh they're really amazing cars so what have we got we're going to use react gs right that's part one we've got to build this okay with all this happening we're going to do a few things to style all of this we're going to use style components that's the one thing you need to understand right so style components are going to be used throughout here on top of that look at let's go ahead and take a look at some of the pages we got model s page the model 3 page you know uh so forth if i go to for example this model 3 page right here if i scroll down oh look at this beautiful beautiful page that we can see now you can see how we have all these animations right now right uh when i scroll down we have these beautiful animations that kind of pop up well that's using something called react reveal react reveal which is a really really cool module that we're going to use in this one of course as well we have ourselves a nice sidebar right here okay and to make all this work of course in to save the data the car info data that will also be saved in where while in something called react redux so you guys get the chance to kind of create your own react redux component here as well right so this is going to be one of the most amazing clones you get to build um we should be able to build this in one take no problem whatsoever right so if you're ready let me know give it a thumbs up go ahead and smash the like button for us it honestly means the world to us it tells us that you are excited that you are you know that you like what we're doing and this allows us to do more of it as well of course right and this of course allows youtube to get this out to more and more people so of course we can go ahead and teach more people at the same time and so forth all right all right all in that let's go ahead and get started right away who's ready who's ready who's ready i see all of you amazing people right there all right let's go ahead um so the first things first that we need to do let me go ahead and put this beautiful music kind of in the background while we're working let me see make sure is how is everybody doing oh hello hello hello we have so many amazing people we have uh penguin hello hi we have pumped bhavik says beautiful i love it nas what's up what's up how are you doing good good good good good let's go hello dignity and i like it too all right let's go ahead and get this party started to build something like this will of course require a few different things right uh we just start up with first is the react redux uh application right this is the code as you can see um nothing crazy we have the homepage the header page the section page this is our goal in terms of where we need to get to um but for now a few things let's go to about finder right now right uh if you're on windows of course it's gonna be for you it's gonna be a different situation um just open up your what is it called my computer whatever it has to be and let's go ahead and create a new folder i'm going to open up a new folder inside where well inside pretty much something called a terminal hopefully you guys can have that it's at the terminal right there beautiful and i'm going to zoom in so you can see much better okay all right and let's go ahead and do the following thing for this you of course need node.js right so hopefully you installed that if you have not installed that install node.js on your computer and everything will be good from there all right um so we'll do npx create dash dash react dash app we'll give them a react the name so let's go ahead and do tesla clone task clone beautiful and we'll do template and redux is the name of the template right right there hit enter there we go it's kind of compiled it's gonna do all necessary things it needs to do it's gonna work it's gonna go this and okay anyways i'm just you know passing time as it's kind of loading so as you can see it's creating the initial repository that you need right for for what well for basically for um your application okay that's what it specifically needs somebody said hi my name is tesla that's funny happy hacking is what we currently have happy hacking beautiful it's exactly what we need to get to right that means our application has been complete not completed but it's installed all right uh once that you can go ahead and close this out no problem no problem and at this point let's go and go ahead and open obvious code i will do new window on my side i do not need this portion of this right here that portion goes somewhere else for me i could probably do it somewhere else let me go ahead and put this portion desktop too there we go all right beautiful all right so this is obvious code let's open this up on the left hand side and put my testicle on the right hand side so it's a little bit better all right i like it and let's do file open file open beautiful go to github and then go to nas and then this is the tesla code that we just opened up right so i will open up tesla clone here okay beautiful all right so okay and let's see what we've got so far all right there's a tesla car that got beautiful um what do we have well to actually start this let's go right click this go ahead and open in integrated terminal all right and what we will do is we'll do yarn what yarn start so we're gonna use yarn this time because it's okay you can use both npm and yarn are both amazing so and yarn start boom that's going to start our application hope you guys can hear me all well yeah it's going to start application uh this is not prerecorded this is actually live guys by the way it says i'm live i can see you i can see you right now in the comments if you say hi i'll say hi back to you as simple as that all right let's go ahead and do that beautiful nice nice nice nice nice okay let's see let's see let's see okay all right so this is our webpage that we have right now this is not a vtest local don't you worry okay uh this is just a starter application that react usually comes with right so at this point uh what are we going to do all right we need to erase some of this stuff let's go ahead and go to app.js right here and let's go to the header and let's remove this stuff honestly we don't need any of this stuff right here sayonara baby done you're away all right now we have a white screen which is pretty good too right we've got ourselves the white screen all right hit enter all good let's go to some index.css some of this stuff we don't need as well so we can remove some of this stuff which is just unnecessary too okay all right beautiful and so here we go now at this point a few things that we need to do as well is we need to divide this into application into a few different pieces correct and what kind of pieces would you divide this into well let's think about this right if i will if i have something like this right here's we have we have this application this might be like the whole app right so this is the whole app after that what do we have well we have the header right we have the header which is this one right this header might be divided into a few different parts as well we've got the logo we might have ourselves the menu like maybe we call it like the left menu icon or the left menu bar and then we have the right menu right there right underneath that we have the actual content or which is this we will call like a section right and now this section now has a few different things right let's think about it okay well the first job is like this text component so this contains like the model s the order online and stuff like that right so that's what called a text component okay then what do we have we have a button component right here okay it's a button component that will contain the buttons like custom order existing delivery and so forth and our last one is going to be this really fancy bouncing bouncing bouncing bouncing uh arrow okay um and that's pretty much it and our goal is to repeat these components so forth and so forth as you kind of go forward and so forth i see right there see right so that's pretty much it and as we repeat uh you know there's nothing else to it um and of course after that we'll figure out how to create the other pages like the detail page and so forth okay all right beautiful so let's go ahead and get started alright beautiful so as we said the first we need to create is going to be the header component and let's go ahead and do that so i will do source new folder and i will say components i'm not component components components component okay let's go do a new file and we'll say header dot js okay all right and i'm going to use something called react snippets as you can see right here we have something called es7 react snippet so hopefully you guys can install that as well on your side um right if you install those don't have them go ahead and click install i already have them installed but what they will help me to do is if i go to header.js check this out all i got to do is type at the following rfce done hit enter right like this is pretty cool what do we have ourselves well we have ourselves a function component that's what we had ourselves right here okay and if i say header here right here right and then i'm going to import the header into app.js so let's do that right now so we'll go ahead and do import what import header from from what well a few things components so we'll have to hit the components folder slash header voila beautiful all right and we'll use the header now like so okay save that and let's go ahead and see our new beautiful what is it our beautiful header component which is just pretty much just a header text um let's actually make it much better right so here's what we can do now at this point guys is let's go ahead and go to index.css and a few things i want to do is to change right um let's go ahead and target everything right now right so again nothing crazy so far let's go and target everything and the first thing is we're going to change the one with change the font family right to make it more robotic you know it says rubik rubik's cube whatever it's going to be all right that could be the first one let's go and change the color of also of this specific what of the specific um good of this webpage so this will apply to everything pretty much right this color will apply to every every any type of text right i just want to keep it consistent i'll give it a margin of zero so that there's all these headings do not have all these crazy margins which i don't like and give it a padding of zero as well okay good all right awesome and we're going to use the code something called border size oh no box sizing border box now for those of you who don't know what this is it's basically when you say the width of something it's going to include the padding within that div it's a little bit confusing but basically uh this will allow us to better control the width of the actual dibs that's what that will allow us to do box sizing will say border box border dash box there we go so i know i have a hard time typing sometimes guys so you can see [Laughter] all right let's go ahead and focus on the body now so we'll do body and we'll give it a width of what width of a hundred percent right here okay good and honestly that's pretty much it okay with 100 that's all i need so far okay good uh let's go back to our this okay you see our header now looks a little bit more different which is completely okay after the header what do we say we need to create we need to create the actual home home page right so we have the home page and we have the header okay um let's create the home page now and components do new file and we'll do home.js beautiful all right all right and we'll do rfce again i love this one rfce and you got yourself a seat i don't know whatever all right uh same thing this one let's go ahead and do home okay we'll import inside app.js right here and so forth home dash like this okay import it right here so import importante import home from what components compontentos commonentos component dash home okay don't judge me all right good let's see what we got so far and we got ourselves a home component i'm going to come with the header one for now just temporarily because i'm going to focus only on the home component right now okay and again i just want to make sure this is clear if you cannot follow along don't worry about it you know this is you know this will be available after you know the this is done so don't worry about if you cannot follow along just go ahead and review it again all right beautiful so the home component is there which i really really like um now let's focus on a few different things within the home component uh and let's go to home.gs now for the styling we're going to use something called style components and we need to install them first so go to your terminal let's go ahead and click plus on it and we'll do yarn add and we'll do styled dash style dash components style dash yarn add yarn there we go so it's going to go ahead and add the yarn all right save that that's all good and we will now import import styled from what okay improved from styled dash components good save that all right now for this component the first time we're going to create something called the container component so we'll do this container no not container container okidoke okidoki container there we go container that's going to be our first component we'll do and with the container component let's go ahead is equal to style so this is basically will give us allow us to style the specific div right that's the power of style components instead of doing it inside css we do inside javascript and so it just makes things a lot easier for us right and now we'll do a height height of what 100 vh oh 100 vh good how are you guys doing by the way all doing good is everybody doing good everybody's still kind of on track with me if you guys are let me know let me know let me know let me see everybody's doing amazing somebody uh somebody says i like how nas uses the different boxes to show us the different uh yeah different things that's amazing awesome thank you thank you i appreciate you guys all right so a height of 100 vh so let's go ahead and save that and let's look at what we have so far nothing okay it's kapusta it's pretty much nothing right now okay again what we're making right now is what well we're making the component that's going to be this component right here so it's this whole component right which is this yellow component that's what we're looking at right now right this whole yellow component that's the home.js okay um and within this home.js let's think about kind of well how are we going to create all these sections right we have this one section another one section another section and you can see the style of them was just pretty much the same you see they're pretty much the same right there so logically speaking what if we just create another cabinet called section and that will allow us to reuse it every single time so if i right click on it let's do a new file and i say section section and we'll do rfce here too and enter okay section is what we need to type in go to 100.s and let's import our first section so say import section section from what from from what well because our current home.js is inside the components folder we don't need anything else besides that right um we don't as anything else besides that instead what we need is is just simply dot slash section like this right because we're already in the components folder okay let's go ahead and type in section to actually use it okay good beautiful all right awesome and then let's see what we've got so far nothing well we've got this section which is good all right in this section that gs now i promise now this is where the magic happens okay the magic happens now here all right okay so if we go to our section.js a few things that we need to really consider okay just how we consider this what do we say let's go ahead and create this text component first uh that's the first one but before we doing that i'm going to create a wrap so here's what i'll do i'm going to create a wrap here right there wrap and that's going to be component we'll just call the wrap we can call the container whatever has to be and so forth all right let's import style components so import i'm going to use here we go import import importante import styled styled from what from style dash components okay good all right that's so good and then uh let's go ahead and create the wrap so const wrap is equal to what styled.div okay stop.dev now this is where again our fancy styled div component you know is going to happen but they were almost at 496 likes if you can get us to 500 let's do that guys 500 likes that'll be amazing and i just want to also let you know guys by the way uh one really important thing um down below what's gonna happen right now is we are we have a fullsize master bootcamp that we've launched a while ago and we have a new class starting in june and so there's limited spots to go ahead and join and so we have a limited availability for new students to join um full stack mastery we've had a lot of students joined fulltime mastery in the previous classes and it's been amazing so many positive results so many people getting jobs and so many people just getting results in general if you yourself are interested in actually being becoming a developer and you want something that will push you give you kind of accountability give you some guidance give give you proper guidance a proper road map like a fullon roadmap for six seven eight months right but you will stick with us the whole time you get mentored by me by kazi and the whole team here at clever programmer right like i said fullscreen master bootcamp is what we've created to help you do that um if you're interested go ahead we have a seat reservation down below to reserve your seat all it is is just seat reservation and then we figure out all the financing later this tells us you're serious and that's pretty pretty much it right like i said link is down below right but the most important part i'll just let you know not everybody gets in some people get denied unfortunately because you know you might not have either good energy you may you might not be positive or you might just be you know not might not be a good fit so we look at a lot of different things for people to be able to join something like this it's a very much it's a very serious thing that we we uh of course we take we take care of take this very seriously of course so if you're interested come in there with good energy right put down a your c reservation link down below and after that we'll get a call and then we'll figure out how to actually get you into the boot camp okay awesome that's pretty much it let's go ahead and continue on beautiful all right uh a section okay what's gonna happen in this section uh the wrap is nothing nothing crazy the wrap is gonna be width of a hundred percent width of 100 v we'll call it vw vw it's like the car vw you know that was my first car actually 100 vw which is the full view width right that's the fuel view width that's what it means okay then we'll give it a height as well and we'll give it a height of what a hundred vh right here a hundred vh so a hundred vertical height pretty much is what it says okay all right let's get the background color background of like orange just so you can see exactly what we are working with all right there we go right so this is all working right write the whole view view with the whole view height okay all right um at this point let's go ahead and give it a background image and the background image should be this one right here now where you get this background image again what's gonna happen is we have a google drive folder with all the images down below right so if you all you have to do is just simply open this on this one up you open the google drive folder the images folder and you put it inside your public folder like so so right now i have no images folder of course i can actually open it open up the google drive folder inside my application let me go ahead and take a look at it where i can do that let me see where do i have it one second i think i have right here actually yeah i have the images folder right here there we go so i have my images folder right here right so this is the one that that you guys will get um if you go ahead and download the google drive folder just go ahead and go description below download it from there and you'll be all good and then all you need to do is need to unzip it of course and then once you've got that just grab that and then drag it into the public folder right like like so just drag it in done right and now it's all in here right this is a lot of different stuff for you um you know between the model s the model three all these different images that you need to use okay so if you got that let me know down in the comments and then we'll make sure to take care of you okay beautiful all right uh let's continue on okay all right so when we do the background image well we have a background image called model s.jpg so hopefully everybody was able to get those images like i said link is down in the description below alright uh background image so far nothing showing up which is completely fine let's go ahead and remove this background no i don't want that it's quite hideous there we go um the image is actually there we just don't see it because we need to center it vertically so we need to center the actual background image and to do that what i like to say something like background that size is equal to cover not covered but cover boom you see now all of a sudden this becomes a very different image right there see okay now let's do at that point let's go and center this image the background image and to do that we'll do background um position so background background dash position position and we'll give it a center boom voila center right back position back no i i did this one back go round position there we go see now this car is pushing the center which is exactly what we want to do then let's go ahead and make sure it does not repeat itself so we'll do back on repeat now repeat so we'll do background dash repeat i will say no sorry about that repeat there we go now repeat but no repeat no right there now repeat all right so now it's going to change at this point right we still have ourselves everything we need to have and that's pretty pretty much it okay okay that's what i want you to focus on for now now let's go ahead and add in the tax component stuff okay all we need to create of course is not going to be this text component which is right here and we're going to call it something called item text so item text okay and inside this item text a few things we need to go ahead and create is of course if we look at our test.com what do we have we have a header and we have like a subheader and to make that happen here's what we'll do we'll do an h1 tag each one and this h1 will have the title for now let's just say the title will be model s this is the one the title so model s for now this is temporary data placeholder data okay model s okay beautiful and then uh we'll do another one that's gonna be what the p tag p tag oh let's go ahead and remove that right the p tag and this one's going to have order online for touch as delivery right there boom it and i'll be honest with you it actually is touch's delivery when i ordered the tesla it's like literally it was like chris's morning i woke up in the morning and the car was there on my driveway it was pretty insane i will say like they bring it into you and you you don't have to do nothing you just sign and you sign in on your on your tesla account and then you just say okay take delivery it's pretty cool i will say okay order online for touchless delivery all right and then once we got that let's go ahead and save this of course and to create the item text component here so we'll say const item text is equal to what styled right here styled div okay good all right and with this one uh what do we need to do nothing nothing too crazy we're going to give it some padding top so you can see you already have it here it's pretty good so we need so we'll do padding top dash top and that will be 15 vh 15 vh vh that's pretty funny okay and then we'll do text line center because you know just to align the center technically where it is centered but it's okay okay there we go you see now model s is right here all right that part is done let's look at our next part that we need to figure out which is gonna be the what that's going to be now the buttons right so that's gonna be these buttons right here okay button group okay uh all right let's go ahead and create that component we'll create the component that will actually wrap these buttons right so uh the buttons that we need to go ahead and wrap are these buttons right here right so this is going to be the button group that we're going to create right now okay called the button group right button button sorry my hobo handwriting but i'm trying my best button group okay all right so i'll say button button i'd like to say bhutan in korean means bread group you know and then there'll be a few bundles that we need to create inside here the one is going to be left button and then it's going to be a right button as well so we'll say left button you like my accent and then the right button right but done okay good and then of course all these buttons will have a few different uh there'll be one is gonna be custom order so let's go ahead and do the custom order one so this could be custom order no i'm not i don't know what that was honestly custom order save that and the last one is going to be existing inventory existing existing inventory inventory inventory existing inventory that's the one that we're looking at okay beautiful all right existing inventory and let's see what we have so far um well that we need to create the actual combust groups of course so let's do that right now all right so we'll do the what we'll do const button group is equal to styled.div uh that there for now okay uh nothing crazy so far let's go ahead and create the button the actual that button so we'll do const left button is equal to also style that div okay boom and now for the right bouton the right button we're going to now use the left button as a reference so what does that mean if i say right button button is equal to saying style div style.div can be styled button left button you see this lab button why because it's allow us to inherit all the css of the left button that's pretty much the reason okay now with the button group what are we going to do with the button group uh nothing too crazy so far um let's go ahead and actually focus on the left buttons that's what i want us to focus on right now specifically okay okay so left bouton all right um okay let's do the following let's see what happens here nothing oh we have some stuff we have custom order and stuff like that okay that's fine all right um for this specific section here's we'll do we'll do background color of this left bouton is the following right background color is this color right here okay good that's the background color all right remove this stuff right here on this side that's a background color and then what we need to do is let's do a height of 40 pixels height height of what 40 pixels okay and then we'll give it a width of 256 pixels width of 200 256 pixels okay good all right save that okay sure it's all good and let's see we have so far and so far like it's just it's nasty right so but that's okay don't worry about it right and then what we'll do is we'll give it a color so color of white so white okay now yeah white so that's gonna be the text color so you can see now here the text color right here that's a white text color okay now these are two divs and let's go ahead and center them in the center right so the mini will do display flags on them flex it always selects it splay fox and then we'll do what uh we'll do justify content to center horizontally right horizontally justify content center so we'll do justify let's go ahead and do it this way justify content that's going to be center good all right and then we'll do online item center as well right items center as well okay good okay now what do we have so far right justify content align items center okay um now these are two buttons right so let's go ahead now to make them more look like buttons let's go ahead and add a border radius so we'll do what border dash radius right and that was going to be what let's go give it a 100 pixels oh would you look at that now we have our sometimes now we like to look at right i was going to get opacity it's going to be 0.85 right okay so now we have an opacity that just kind of stays there which is pretty pretty cool okay all right then the next one is going to be what well let's do text transformed make sure it's all uppercase so text transform form all uppercase okay nice that looks sick that looks amazing let's give the smaller font size as well so font dash size is going to be what that's pretty much just 12 pixels something's nothing crazy ah there you go good good good i like it i like it right so that's that's the font size and then what um we need to stack them from left to right that's what we need to figure out how to do right how do you stack them from left to right that's a big question right so to do that uh well a few things we need to go the button group and say display flex on this one boom boom right there you see right away we know what right away it stacks from left to right that's what this display flex allows allowed us to do okay now how do we put this custom order this is the inventory kind of from more at the bottom that's the question i want us to ask right well this happens a few ways well because if we go to the wrap right the wrap controls what let me go ahead and remove this portion now at this point the wrap controls what controls this whole thing right this whole thing right this whole thing right and if i do display flex on it i can actually push these away so that this goes all the way to the bottom right that's what my goal is right so on the wrap i'm going to say display flex display i will say the flex flex it flex it flex it like i said don't forget it display flex beautiful and then at that point what's gonna happen is we'll do what flex direction column right so basic column means we're gonna put it from top to bottom that's what that means okay right direction column there we go see now it's back to normal again now to actually fully make your work all i got to do and actually push this to the bottom well i do something like um justify content space between so justify content right and then space dash between boom oh you look at that it's like all the way over there you guys see that right there that is beautiful all right let's go ahead and do a line item center to align it horizontally so interesting part is you need to know is justified content usually does alignment for horizontal section right so if you want to write align something horizontally right that's what that's the content is for and usually like items is going to be a vertical alignment okay but when you switch the flex direction it switches it flips now justify content is going to be for it's going to be for this one is going to be for vertical alignment vertical and then align items now if i do center right here that's going to be for horizontal alignment or horizontal you see what i mean so the flips when you do flash rushing column you can see now the custom order they're actually they are actually properly aligned right now okay beautiful uh what i want us to focus on now is going to be the the button group let's go ahead and take this button let's give it a margin bottom margin bottom margin bottom off about 30 pixels nice so it's kind of it's a little better now there too okay so i like that a lot better now right and what else do we have let's for these specific buttons let's give them what let's give them a cursor pointer as well so left button this could be cursor cursor pointer okay save that all right so now there i can let me see cur sir cursor okay save that you see i can now exist at the cursor as well all right now a few things opacity is 0.85 that's so good opacity is good a few things i want to focus on um let's add this specific portion remember this one this this like well that is just simply an arrow that's all it is nothing too crazy um so to do that what we'll do is we'll create something called a down arrow and it's all it's just an image right so here's what we'll do we'll create outside the button group and we'll say the following we'll say down arrow like so source is equal to what source is going to be equal to images down here that's vg so we have that inside the images folder again if you want the link to it down below okay boom down arrow okay down arrow images down here right here it's not defined again it's going to create that let's create that down already to create to create so we'll do here we'll do what const down arrow down arrow okay is equal to what is equal to styled dot image right there okay on this image a few things we need to kind of create we'll do margin top margin dash dash top that's going to be 20 pixels to give us some spacing right and then we'll give it a height so a height oh height of what 40 pixels okay nice so it says style styled styled there we go all right so the arrow is now there the custom order is there so it's not the best solutions we need right so um don't worry we'll fix that in a second here okay so you can see what do we have now here's the issue this is now here and this is now here bad right because why because when we did justify content we did space between meaning it's going to create as much space in between every single component here right that's what space in between means right but how do we fix it well very simple by actually making this making this one component right right so for example if i say simply there's buttons i give like this buttons okay check this out buttons okay boom what's gonna happen now what do you think oh new component correct yes yes yes yes that's gonna create new components so called buttons we'll say const buttons buttons equals equal to style that div save that right there see you see what just happened right see this just became like this right see but they're beautiful right it's exactly what we need what we need for this for this right there right there see beautiful and let's go back to now our page application now um how did that happen well because this whole thing became one component that's what happened right this whole thing became one component and so this just pushed it down like this all right all right uh up next let's go ahead and create a little margin between every single button so if i go to my left button i will do margin what i will go ahead and do the following which is margin i think we'll give it 20 pixels i think that's pretty good um either that or just maybe eight pixels see margin margin e pixels like this okay much better much better now i would like for this thing to hop so uh we're gonna make it hop how uh well we're going to create animation we're going to create animation okay uh to do to make that happen here's animation it's gonna be animation called animate down and if i go to my down arrow in here boom right there check this out so right now nothing's happening because we have not created animation you see so it's just kind of like it's like meh right it's mac right now but don't you worry we got you okay don't you worry we got you um what i'm gonna do now at this point is very simple is i will go to index.css right here and i'm going to create the animation myself right this is using keyframes right using keyframes is what it's going to do and i'm just going to copy and paste this here because i'm going to type it out all for you right and what these are is very simple here's what happened imagine like for example that you know uh so keyframes are like percentages of like uh of the actual um of the actual text or the diff for example right so at zero twenty percent you know nothing now forty percent we're going to translate translate basically five pixels up you see right there you see then the same tips are gonna translate three pixels up now at fifty percent we're gonna translate to zero so that's what creates this up and down feeling so if i save this right now boom see that's what crease is upside down up and down filming you see up and down kind of like feeling type and so forth right um this also creates a little bit of an issue with overflow as you can see right here so what i'm going to do is i'm going to give overflow hidden on this specific down arrow right here so this down arrow you see how it creates an overflow well we can fix that by just going to section right and i'm going to say overflow hidden overflow overflow x overflow dash x is going to be hidden boom okay overflow overflow axis hidden let's see down arrow is that let's go ahead maybe fix it using what what can we use fix it using what da da da da da da da da da what if i maybe i'll remove this portion let's go and remove this okay i kind of like that i don't want that margin top it kind of pushes away too much all right so that's good overflow x hidden uh if i go the body let's go to index.css oh okay i need to also do overflow overflow dash x can be hidden boom boom see to make sure we don't have the horizontal scroll bar that was there which would look hideous which i don't like all right so there you go so we got now our translation which is really good okay so we have a translation what's the next step where we are going to work on and that's going to be let me see what you guys are saying some sense is awesome that's awesome sweet uh scs is the way to go yes we'll actually go into scss at some point as well on this channel too uh are you building that using the react yes i am strange my buttons are not all the way down there what you put but yeah so now they're all down sweet now it's all good now it's all good now it's all good okay sweet all right everybody still with me everybody still with me yeah beautiful of course you are because you guys are amazing that's all i can say to you all right and again guys let's go and hit that like button smash the like button help us out with the youtube algorithm that's it that'll that really we'll write 673 likes let's get to 800 that'll be great all right um all right so we got that portion look at this uh let's go and change up this button now the existing delivery button because it actually is different here pretty simple because we go to our section.gs here's our button all we got to do is just change the button color so the right button instead of doing here nothing the right button will be the following the right button will be background color of white background that's gonna be white boom oh that's cool and i'm gonna give it opacity to opacity right 0.65.65 we go okay and then we'll give the color of the text it's gonna be more on the darker side colors will be black there we go nice you see there you go now you got these two buttons and they look pretty good look at that look at that that's it that's all we just did we just did everything we need to do look at this huh how cool is that huh awesome all right so we're almost there now here check this out all we gotta do now this one is just replicate the same situation right so if i go ahead and go to sections now hold on yes if i copy this section and paste it everywhere all right if i paste this section check this out what's gonna happen we have more sections of the same sections there you go that's it now i want us to really figure out the one is like for example if i go small you see how the custom order just kind of like goes outside the boundary we can fix that too actually we can fix that very easily using like media queries right so so basically what we can do is on uh let me go ahead and take a look at let's go to section here you see button this button group right here this button group is it's actually fl flex direction row but if i would go ahead on the media what is what can do i can do media width like this so on the max with basically four four four like small uh max width of 768 pixels those are like small um screens i do flash just column and so they go into column basically meaning from top to bottom like this all right so to the side you see that just happened look at there you see right and how did this happen because when the width becomes 768 pixels you see it applies this right here css flash direction column that's what allows us to do this and that's it there's nothing crazier than that honestly all right so now here's the question now um how do we go ahead and make these model s stuff and make have all this stuff working differently right because what do we have right now it's just all panel s and of course we have model y by the way this is the one oh this is exactly the one i have by the way such a beautiful card look at this oh so good such a good car i love it the special is in this blue color it's so good once you guys agree with me like in a blue color like that's my favorite color by the way yeah uh anyways let's go ahead and do the following we have all these sections right and they're all the same so the question is like how do we make them different right how do we make them different so that they're all different i guess you can say um well we can just pass in something called props right and what are props props are like parameters for a function that's pretty much all it is it's a parameter for a function right so if we currently have the model s right and we have one section we can reuse this just change the title here so here's what i'll do i'll go to home or let's go i'll go to home here and for the section here look we'll pass in a few parameters it's just kind of like your passing parameters for a function that's pretty much it inside here i will pass in two three parameters so let's go ahead and do title okay not like this title is equal to what and this is gonna be model s right and then the description is all gonna be well pretty much you know delivery so the screw is going to be order online that's the description right here let me go ahead and make this better for you order online without just delete that description after that let's go ahead and do what let's do background image background image that's going to the model s one then we'll do the left button text right we have a left button that's gonna be the custom order and then the right button text is going to be existing inventory there you go okay let's go ahead and comment this portion out for temporarily okay because i want to show you how we're going to do this so this gets passed into props if i go into the section itself let's go ahead and go to section itself okay and i have props here they're basically like parameters if i just click console login because unlock props look this is i'll show you this for a second here so look props right click inspect element on this one and i'll show it to you within the console right here good all it is is props is just an object like that's all pretty much is and look at this all this stuff has been passed in right the background image the description the title and so forth and so now all i do is something like for example i do this i do the following what do i do i do props props.what dot title all right i save that browser title look at that look at that model s right here see the title like it was replaced by the actual title within the actual what the actual component right that's all we pretty much had to do okay now we can even be smart about this by being the following we can unpack this using something like this so i can do it like this title boom right there how cool is that okay okay how cool is that check this out so title is right there and i can replace this with title and all this done is this basically just unpacks this whole object this whole object has key and no key like background images so forth but this right here is called unpacking and we're unpacking the object to include to actually just get the get the actual keys that's that's all pretty much does all right so that's it let's go ahead and stop this for now good all right so we have that next one that we're going to unpack is which one that's a description good description which is which one comma description and we can use that here now description boom right there awesome you see again shows up right here okay beautiful just as just the way we like it okay next step is gonna be what the actual left button text so this is this one left button text right here that button text is going to be this one and then right there and then the right button text is going to be right here right button text so we'll use that as a prop as well okay right by text of course we do unpack them as well so we'll do what left button text copy that left button text right here comma right button text command c command v alright so we have unpacked all of these items inside here so if we save that right you can see you know still and nothing really changes but here's what can change if i go to home and if i uncomment some of this stuff okay now i have three different sections what i can do is just change the actual data so here's what i can do here inside this one i can give it the following here's my data here boom this one is title model.p y model one p y model.y that's the they ask the other one description order online background images now model y image and then left button text custom order and same thing here so if i save this oh look at that you see model y has changed now one thing has not changed is the actual image and we'll focus we'll we'll fix that in a second here next one let's do model three okay let's do model three now same thing you see so all we do is we're changing the props we're just passing different props and we're using the same html that's the coolest part about react.js good boom there we go save that let's see model three now again imaging does not change we'll change that a little bit okay next one model x let's do the model x one model x all right we'll do the following there so model x okay there we go okay model x all right same thing look at this model x you see it all just kind of works you know automatically no problem whatsoever now the one big thing we need to figure out is okay well how come the images are not showing well in the section because the image is the same right the image is which image it's uh this image right here that's a background image right um to fix that it's pretty simple actually let's go ahead and go to the home.js and inside actually let's go to section.js section and we need to pass in the actual background image you see we pass on this background image let's go ahead and copy this background image go to section and let's go ahead and unpack this right here comma unpack it right here unpack it so now we have it you know we actually have it inside our component and we need to use it somehow actually okay how do we use it well we use it by actually passing in um well passing in an actual component or a prop into a style component because you can do that too so we'll do bg background image background image background image and we'll say what equal boom right bg image that with a background image that's all and now all we do is inside what is inside our actual what our actual vga immersion wrap you see how we have the wrap here basically instead of doing this here's what we'll do in this case do it like this we'll say background image on this image okay let me just do it properly so you guys can have it let's see right here back on image okay and instead of doing like this i'll do like this okay props so we can actually get props inside style components we'll do props okay and after props what are we gonna say check this out okay dot dot we'll give a url here so i'll say url actually we'll do like this we'll say url and we'll be dash images dash dash the actual prop that we just passed in dash what that's what huh boom look at this tata look at this one that's pretty cool i will do props dot props.what wg image right there off the bg image cross wg image okay so let's see happens now so okay we have this images url and that has images is inside of that okay good okay let's see let's see let's see and then of course i think i think we need to close it as well let me go ahead and make sure it's all good so that's all good that should be all good url is right here that's the url back on yeah i think that's an issue all right let's go and say this background image okay cool now you're ready let's see if it actually changes anything so what's going to happen here we pass in the background image here voila okay then we happens then is that gets passed into the wrap style component right there see vg image then that gets passed to the prop so we have we get props from the actual style component now we have props and we set the background image using the prop so props url images props to bg image that's it save it oh let's go oh oh oh oh oh look at this look at this guys mother y model three model x how cool is that right we just pass in the props and now we have all these different components that are there for us to use look at this oh oh oh it's so good oh my god somebody help me how cool is that that is pretty insane i will say so what do you guys think so far what do you guys think so far let me see what are you guys thinking oh everything's working everything's working almost 800 likes let's go let's get to a thousand guys you guys are amazing you guys are amazing 800 likes let's go so again we're passing in props at this point and here's what we look at this we build ourselves a full on tesla i mean we haven't built the tesla clone just yet fully but it's getting there it's getting there it's pretty cool all right let's finish up the actual um section so i will go to here and i will do the following so let's go ahead and go to home.gs and we have a few more sessions we need to finish up right next one is going to be the solar panels section so let's do a section section section all right it's a solar panel section okay and i have it right here for you guys so you guys can kind of just copy this out yourself boom right there okay all right title lowest cost solar panels description money back guarantee like an image is this one order now this done let's see it now let's see it oh it's so good it's so good guys it's just so good so good okay next one solar for new roofs so that's another one we're gonna also also create right now so here's another section we're going to create you see how easy this stuff is is so easy to create now right because all we're doing is just we're using the same component but but with different uh parameters what it is now oh so good oh my god oh my god it's so good guys i don't know i just love these images i love these images that i can tell you next one last one is gonna be the accessory section which is gonna be this section right here last section accessories so feel free to cover this on your own by yourself as well title accessory description is nothing the left button is nothing and then right button text we don't have any of that as well let's go ahead and remove that nice let's go ahead and see okay now here's one issue that we found right so here's an issue we have the shop now button right shop now button and then because we only have one button here this created what issue well the fact that this channel is not the center which of course is bad so how do we fix that pretty simple if i now go to my section gs basically here's what i'll say if the right button exists only then while i go ahead and showcase it so here's what i'll do check this out i will say right button right button text okay then i will go ahead and do the following and then only then will i do this right there that's all save it look at this you see shop now but is exactly the mail because why before the right button was always there just it had the empty right button text but now now what happened is we just said hey if the right button text exists only then do you show the right button the actual right button but if it's not does not exist forget about it don't even show it and the left button is going to be the only one that's left and that's pretty much it okay look at that look at this is so good oh my god you guys this is amazing oh oh yes yes okay okay next portion we're going to work on is the header are you ready with me yes or no yes yes yes all right let's see who's here still with us let me see let me see beautiful everybody says let's go let's go if you guys still with me let me know down in the comments below let me know down in the comments below car animation yes there's a condemnation yes correct beautiful beautiful beautiful i'm just like cool let's go really good yes thank you thank you yes everybody's still with me that's what i'm talking about yes let's go hey that's what i'm talking about awesome guys let's go campbell's like cheeky picky that's what i'm talking about yes all right next up here's what we

decided from one we have a boot camp that's starting june 1st ending date comes in a few days for you to be able to reserve your seat so if you are someone who's really interested in becoming a developer and you you are maybe you're stuck in tutorial hell maybe you were just stuck and just you really want to become a developer or you've never got the chance to become a developer and you really need the proper guidance fullsize mastery something they created a while ago to go ahead and get that for you right you know ankh for example who just got his first job making seventy thousand dollars we have was apple martin recently you know who got his first job making fifty six thousand dollars right it's crazy right and they didn't finish the boot camp now i mean not they're still in the boot camp and we have two more people who currently have reactions internships are in the boot camp as well you know another one by name liz she got her first freelancing client making 15 hours it's pretty insane right what you can do we focus on a foundation you focus on building up your developer skills and just giving you the proper knowledge and giving you the proper guidance basically the whole way through you get taught by me and the five other coaches it's pretty insane if you're interested in doing something like this like i said it's a very serious matter you have to be dedicated with a minimum of 20 hours a week 20 hours of work per week if you're not ready for that don't even bother if you're you're not ready to put in time don't even bother also if you're someone who who who really thinks that you know oh i am just fully can do this by myself i don't need anybody else's help don't bother as well we are here to help people who want to be helped that's it if interested like i said see reservations down below doors are closing very soon to be able to reserve your seat they're closing actually in the next few days so if you interested go ahead and click down below and we'll be all good all right awesome guys all right let's get anyone all right there we go so what have we got we've got this now i want us to focus on the header that's what i want us to focus on now at this point all right uh let's go ahead and do this let's go ahead and in our oh this this whole git do add and we'll say sections sections for the tesla it's pretty funny for the tesla okay save that beautiful all right section of the tesla all is good next up um a few different things huh what are we gonna say what we're gonna do we're gonna do head.gs here's what we're working on now let's go ahead and put the header inside here right go let's go let's go the header is pretty big actually and it will require some a good amount of work guys okay require a good amount of work oh 800 likes that is pretty pretty awesome pretty awesome all right let's go ahead and import style components so import styled from style component style dash component there we go all right sweet sweet sweet sweet tweet good let's go ahead and do the following we'll do create the what create a container here like we always like to do container right there all right so create a container here as well all right let's go ahead and create this in there so import style up no no const container is equal to what style.what dot div there we go that's going to be the container okay and now uh for this container a few different things and this container will have the first thing it will have is of course let's think about it what does it have initially well a few different things let me go ahead and show this to you we'll have the header and so we need what we have the kind of like the um we have the logo that's part one and we have the menu that's part two and we have the right menu that's part three okay that's part three so we'll divide them into three parts let's do our first let's go ahead and do the logo okay i'll create a tag right because that logo will have we'll have a link and we'll give it a little an image right here look at this out image right here this is the image the image that's only so image source images logo.svg that's it save that let's see does it show up somewhere ah not really why because in the home.js actually inside the app.js we're not importing this there we go let's go ahead and comment the head.gs so we can actually use it beautiful hey you guys have a toaster look look at that it's a beauty it's such a beauty yes oh something happened that's really interesting i don't want that okay header nice all right let's go ahead and click on the menu so we'll do menu menu menu menu okay sweet so that's the menu okay menu is not defined because we're going to create this right now so i'll say const menu is equal to what styled dot div customize your style dot the viv okay also nothing crazy here let's go ahead and give some data or some styling for the actual container the actual header so the header will have a few things number one let's give it a min height min height of what of 60 pixels there we go okay 60 pixels okay good that's the min height right there see so it's a little bit bigger now that's good and you see it's white but we actually kind of want to be on the one position fixed so we actually want to be a in you know actually have fixed positioning and so to do that here's we'll do position fixed right position fixed means what means that it will just be here right here you see it's always there on the top no matter what it is no matter what no matter where where you are okay next um let's do the following to display flags to display flags to align a vertically to align them vertically center so display display flex right here flex okay good all right next up we'll do online items center oh that's not the one good now see the tesla centered okay good let's go ahead and give some padding so we'll see padding 0 20 pixels done oh okay good beautiful all right all right so now look at that it's pretty pretty much there look at that the tesla clone okay all right so that's all good uh the next thing we need to work on is going to be the what the menu the menu has a few different things um what does it have well you've got ourselves what model s model 3 model x model y that's what it has okay that's what it's got to make that happen let's go ahead and do this okay in the menu let's give it a p tag p tech and i said that that would be an a tag href is equal to currently nothing nada okay boom okay good and so that has the following that has let's go ahead and say for example like model s model s for now okay that's the model that's the that's the p tag that we're going to use all right all right let's go ahead command c command v commander so though might be what model x there's going to be model what is it where are the models here what is it the model s model 3 model three who's excited for the roaster by the way that's gonna be really cool model x i'm really excited for the roadster that's going to be a crazy car if model y is a crazy car model ass is a crazy car i mean all them are pretty much crazy i just can't imagine what the roast is gonna be all right okay good awesome sweet so that's pretty awesome all right let's see what happens now okay there we go okay um so what happens here is you can see we have the a tag which kind of makes it you know has underlined we can very much easily fix that by going inside the index.css boom let's give the a tag so let's target all a tag a tag and we'll do text transformation or text transform none what does that mean or text equation not so text decoration because by default it's underlined where is it right here that's the default one but instead we'll just say what none so if i say that see it's gone nice beautiful all right next one is in the menu you see how they're kind of one on one one on top of each other we can fix it also by using display flex let's go to menu okay and in the menu all we gotta do is the following it's just display flex it display flex display flex it that's how we do it and we'll do online items no no we'll do display flex which let's go ahead and save that nice beautiful we will do align item center good beautiful that's amazing okay nice nice nice line up center that center is it let's go ahead and also give it maybe some spacing i would say so as well uh and to do that let's go ahead and target the actual uh let's see uh p within this here so we'll do what font wait i will do what let's do it here let's do a font weight wait it's going to be 600 okay good nice beautiful and we'll do a text decoration text decoration creation that's going to be uppercase boom did now workout text decoration text transform actually text transform my bad transform there we go model s models three beautiful nice and then let's go ahead and give it some padding so for every single pizza i will give a padding so padding padding is gonna be 0 10 pixels 0 this in this case means top and bottom so basically top of bottom 0 left and right is 10 pixels that's what that means boom right there see right there see oh let's also do a flex wrap flex um wrap let's do no wrap all right to make sure it's not wrapped because i like the fact that it's wrapping like you know and so forth um i think it's just no wrap like this i feel like that ah maybe i'm wrong anyways so here's what we got so far which is pretty good all right um a few different things i want us to focus on as well what we're going to do is we're going to make this menu basically a full width so flex one so by giving a flex one we're giving it a full kind of weight flex one and then if i say something like this for example if i say just the content center check this out justify content boom i'll justify content center what happens here no nothing ah justify content align item center let me see here container display flex let me make sure it's all good why is it not doing so justify content center flex 1 why is it not because here's the goal i wanted to also fully be the full width here so if i do inspect element let's see what happens happening here right now okay we have this oh it's actually not the full width it's unfortunate it's actually because this is not the full width oh so you see this right here this is why inspector is so important sometimes guys you see the full header is not the full width of the actual page now to make that happen it's pretty easy actually check this one out try this one out so to make that happen all we have to do is the following um is we give it right here so this container you see this container the header is i do the following i say top 0 right that will stick it to the to the zero to the top okay that's left zero we'll stick it to the left okay now right zero is we'll stick it to the right meaning it will expand you see right there it says what happened it will expand the header with the full width that's what just happened you see that right there the header is the full width how cool is that right how cool is that so that's what just happened so now we have these specific models okay great the last the next thing you need to work on is going to be what well uh that's gonna be uh this shop tesla account let's go ahead and make that one happen too so that's pretty easy as well and again some of this stuff is also going to be like we'll change it up later on to make sure it's actually like you know the menu is right so now we'll do the right menu right menu right menu okay and inside the right manual there'll be a few different things we'll have first it will have ahref is equal to what let me go ahead and actually i think this shouldn't be p i think we should remove this stuff i think this should be just a tags honestly that's something in here same thing with this boom remove this just so we have an a tag there's no reason to have all these p tags so we just will consistent throughout the whole thing okay and you can use command d to make sure it's all consistent okay so ahref and uh it's gonna be nothing of course and this will be a shop okay okay next one's gonna be a shrap a shrap is gonna be equal to what is equal to each draft is equal to which one which is actually tesla account so let's go ahead and do that will be tesla account good good good good and the last thing we need to do is we need an icon that's like a burger icon right here so we'll do that in a second here but first i'm going to focus on the right menu that's what i want to focus on for a second here okay so let's do right menu so save that of course we have that does not define right now so that's not a problem whatsoever so we'll do menus this menu okay so we'll do a tag here instead of p make sure you're targeting a tag now at this point you see okay good all right let's go ahead and do const right menu is equal to what style dot div that's all it is okay um let's see here right menu is not defined yes it is you just need to refresh it there we go all right same thing we can do also the same thing on this one and also target the actual individual what the individual a tags using something like this boom you see save it hey let's go beautiful all right so that's that's pretty good i kind of like that so let's find way 600 textures from uppercase on the right menu padding let's go don't think i will remove probably is going to be like the the padding and also i'll do do margin margin right 10 pixels so now the sharpness are kind of more closer that's the only thing i'll do at this point and then let's go ahead and remove this donate this okay good i like that um the only thing that's pretty much we need to do is let's see let's see let's see it's going to be that the little hamburger menu that's what it's called so if i go to my tesla account you see there's a hamburger menu we can fix that so we can actually make that work it's pretty cool check this one out to make this one work it's it kind of works like this um we're gonna use material ui so material ui icons let's go install that one let's go here beautiful all right and here's our material icons and you just type in menu done here's our menu see right there dune let's go import this command c okay and import it into our actual what right here so import that now how do you actually need to install of course immature ui so to install into install materia core and material ui icon so let's go ahead and do install material ui right there there we go right here so the first thing to install is going to be i'm actually going to use yarn so i'm going to say yarn add material ui core so to do that let's go ahead and open inside integrate terminal right there beautiful and we'll do yarn add material ui course that's the core uh bits biscuit with your ui see that add that beautiful very very beautiful we're almost 854 likes let's go let's get to 900 you guys are amazing as always 900 likes that'll be awesome okay next one is going to be material ui icons and to do that we'll do yarn add material icons right here okay okay command k boom boom voila we're done okay while i do this i'm gonna drink my so good so good so good alrighty beautiful nice nice nice nice nice while that's doing hope you guys are still with me hope you guys are enjoying the build all the tesla clones gonna be interesting one i think i'll be really cool to build is actually the tesla clone dashboard you know how there's a dashboard where the tesla's used inside there that'll be amazing to build and we're working on that one as well so that's gonna be really cool um but yeah so many exciting things happening guys you have no idea oh there you go all right let's see so that's all good now to to use mature ui we've done already here look at this we install material ui and now we just import the menu icon that's the only thing we now need okay let's see i thought it was pretty funny don't you guys think so yeah i think somebody right guys let's go ahead and continue on you guys are always as always are amazing someone said party code you know it that's how we do it all right all right guys so is math important for coding no it's not i'll just answer that for you math is not important for coding at all in fact it's you don't need it at all like zero zip not knowledge nothing just so you know all right oh beautiful all right now at this point let's go ahead and add a menu icon we're going to create our own menu icon because uh we'll change the styling of it so we'll say custom menu custom menu right here right here and we'll use the menu icon like so so let's go ahead we'll do right here so const custom menu is equal to styled styled what styled nope styled what style menu icon style menu icon right there see style menu icon okay now what can i do with the style menu icon really nothing i'm kidding it can do a lot so here's what happened here check this out oh it's so good that's so good all right beautiful i like it um for the right menu let's go ahead and display flex it so display flex to make sure it's all align center so display flex display flex okay beautiful and we'll do online items center just another center i don't think there we go display flag center align item center there we go it's right there on the menu icon we'll do a cursor pointer cursor that is going to be a pointer good good good good good good good good good good good cursor pointer refresh it oh let's go and nothing's happening so far i don't worry about that just yet okay now another thing i want us to focus on is going to be look look at how by the way guys just want to say how good this look already look at this guys this is sick this is amazing so proud about one thing i want to change you see how this model actually gets squished well we're going to make the change that you know whenever you get to a small screen you just remove it now to remove it again how do we do the last time we're also going to use uh media queries just how we did the last time right and with media queries it's pretty simple you just do like this try this out so on the menu group on the menu on the menu right here so we'll say what media again max with us 768 pixels meaning basically when we get to 768 pixels browser width we say display none on the full thing so save that boom right there see oh let's go boom now what's happening here you see that shot past the account for some reason is doing this thing where it's like going all the way to the left hand side and we can fix that by what go into the container and currently we say align item center but to make them space out we say justify content content and then we'll just space between that's it wind there we go look at that oh oh oh yeah there we go so beautiful i love it so how cool is this guys huh that's pretty pretty amazing 893 likes guys you guys are amazing 900 let's go okay so that is all good that's cool good all right the next thing i want to focus on is you know how inside if i refresh this page it has like this really slick animation and it's pretty cool i kind of like it you guys want to install the animation i think so too so how do we make this animation works it's going to use it called react reveal check this out react reveal and all this is just a module it's basically just a module for react uh for animation library you see this pretty much anything you want i mean we can even use different effects if you if you wanted to there's a zoom effect and so to creationally add a fade effect it's pretty simple you just you know you install react reveal like so right and then you do what then you do basically you add not zoom but you do see where's the fade i want to do fade home fade fade fade face fade effect there we go right there fade left you know you just give the fade that's pretty much it that's it see that's all happens so let's go ahead and make that one work that's pretty cool um if i have my model s here no matter why yeah that's cool all right so open up in terminal right here and let's do yarn add yarn add and what react reveal let's see one more time tutorials instructions react reveal right here react reveal so you're an ad direct reveal boom adding that to the react good good good beautiful nice okay all right now that that's happening all it's gonna happen now at this point let's go back to our react reveal let's go into the fade effect we need to import the fade right here so import fade okay let's go and import fade here on this is the the let's go ahead this needs to be done on a section so import fade here boom and all we need to do is now just basically you know group the fade of what you wanted to fade it's as simple as that right so here's what i'll do on the item text i will say the following i will say fade where is it where is it i will say here fade faded i'm so faded fade bottom from the bottom boom and i will give it a round this could be around the item text boom okay let's see it now oh how good is this check this one out guys all right i like that next let's go ahead and do around the bottom group right here so do the following so we'll do fade same thing also bottom boom oh so good so good sugar oh my god i love this this is so good oh i love that the animation is so good i mean who doesn't come on guys come on come on come on give me a break come on how good is this huh how good does this look i mean if you're not getting i don't know what's going on with you you know so i'm getting very close okay the next thing i want to start working on work on is going to be what is going to be the actual um kind of sidebar right so the sidebar that kind of comes up from here when i click on this we need to have a sidebar that comes up on the right hand side okay um so let's make that one happen sidebar is what called a broker nav menu um and for now let's go just let's go ahead and just create a program menu and that will be done so the head.gs right there so let's do this so burger burger nav okay and this one will just have a bunch of like for example like items so here are the items they should look like so we'll create a few items like this for example we'll say we'll use uh ally elements so we'll say li like this and we'll give an a tag so we'll say a ashraf is equal to nothing so far okay nothing so far but inside there for example we have things like existing inventory inventory right we also things let's go ahead and copy this right here so command c command v commit uh command v command right uh we have a few different things that we're going to say so in the same inventory we have used inventory right for example used inventory we have for example tradein right trade uh trade dash in you know and so forth and so forth let's go ahead and maybe modify some of these right here babies oh the cyber truck who's excited for that one cyber truck right here there's maybe the roadster that's a pretty cool one too right there and so what we're building right now is pretty much the following right we're building this menu boom this menu on the right hand side that's our building right there oh this money on the righthand side everything else will build now we just need to go ahead and focus on that one okay uh you can see these where they have model x use inventory that's just pretty much those items right there all right awesome sweet so we got that portion that's so good um and the burger nav of course is not existing right now so we need to create that so we'll say const const what const burger nav burger now is equal to what burgernav is equal to styled.div right there all right oh that looks hideous don't worry about it guys okay so don't worry about this so the burger now right now uh let's go ahead and do the following we'll just put it on top of everything else that's that's kind of needed all right um so for one it's gonna be position fixed so position fixed why because it's always in the top no matter what right it's always gonna be where on the right hand side right always going to be here no matter what page you're on okay so there's no fixed now where i'm going to say top 0 right i'm going to say bottom 0 to stretch it over to the bottom and then i'm going to say right 0. that will take it all to the right hand side boom okay you see now to the right hand zero good next all right at this point let's go into background color back background white nice you see so it's kind of getting there a little bit all right so it's background white let's give it a width width oh 300 pixels good nice okay i like it good good good let's also give the z index because obviously it's like kind of like i think it's kind of like the index so does the index of like 10 100 let's see is it 100 um i think it's because in that case we need to go ahead and make everything else is the index of smaller that's what we need to do in that case so that means that everything else oh man that's a lot okay so the whole section now let's do this let's go to section how and this right here will say z index index of 10 let's just say would that change anything because i want this to be on top you see what i mean i want it to be on top is what i'm trying to get to let's think about it here the index 10 that's gonna be maybe negative one negative one no that's not at the index of let's just say the index of ten so what's what's being overwritten so let's see okay let's see let's see let's see let's see so well for one is the item text so i think we need to focus on item text here so let's do item text let's do this one it's gonna be z index it's gonna be 10. come on give me something so item text z x minus one does that mean the home just needs to have a smaller z index i'm just trying to think here guys what do you guys think here so home maybe this is going to be easy index of 10 maybe no did not change nothing okay let's see how do we go ahead and make sure that this kind of works the way i wanted to so z index of 10 what do you guys think you have any suggestions and we have any suggestions sometimes refresh no home 10 it's max but do 10 for sidebar okay so for sidebar let's try that for the header for the burger now let's try that i mean i can't do anything like let's see still not nothing how do we fix the zindex issue the index of let's try this the init of 16. i'm just thinking here let's see easy index oh maybe it's this other contain really let's see if i go to here and i say this container is z index of one oh what the heck oh that makes sense oh so we actually so it was competing the weight was competing not with everything else it was actually competing with the actual header which is the container which is above it because this remember this broken app is within this so in order to have this show up above this the container we need to give this as small as the index and give this one a zenith of like 16 let's say okay that makes sense okay so there we go all right so cool we kind of got that that's pretty awesome i kind of like that don't you agree okay so now let's go ahead and focus on we have the index okay let's do the burger now and top zero with that's good that's good now okay let's go ahead and remove this list out because it's horrible list style it'll be none okay good next let's do padding 20 pixels to give it some padding all around good nice nice nice nice nice nice nice okay paint 20 pixels then let's go ahead and do the following then we'll do back around no no no so the list style is kind of like not the way i wanted to because why because it's centered which is not what i like so to make that work i just do display flex on this one just place the display flags on this puppy there we go good and then we'll do flight direction column got there ah it's still okay don't worry and then uh we'll do what flex um justify content justify content okay flex start good oh like this like justify content really come on really nothing is it text online text align what start okay never mind you don't need this livestream column in that case i mean that could still be useful actually but we don't need this one so texas line start which is good which i like okay uh let's see where are we at so on this one we have model three model s okay i like that so now let's go ahead and focus on each line so li okay so a lie on this one we'll do the following on this a line we'll do so we'll have padding top and bottom padding 15 pixels for every single one and then left and right is gonna be zero for now okay and we'll give it a border bottom boom right there good okay good and we'll give it a tag so on the let's go ahead and see let's see now oh let's go that looks good that looks good okay i like it i like it i like it let's go ahead and give it and the tag let's just give it a more of a font weight so we'll do font weight weight font weight by the way we're almost at a thousand likes guys come on let's get this party started fund weight 600 good ay let's go now of course now the thing you need to work on is how do you actually make it work so that it actually shows up properly you know what i mean because right now it's just kind of there right so right now it's just kind of there um yeah it's top right bottom zero you know and how we need to hide it somehow so how do we hide it well for one let's go ahead and add an x button so in the material ui icons it's going to find a find material icon so let's do material ui icons material let's find an x button x there we go close okay good exactly what we want so close icon all right all right oh look how good this is guys oh my god it's so good okay let's go ahead and import our close button here okay so inside the broker nav we'll create we'll actually go ahead and do this close button right here oops oops so we'll do um we'll do what custom close so we'll say this custom close custom close so it's going to create a custom close button and how we're going to do that well by using style components so let's go here const custom close is equal to what styled uh no styled what let's see style close icon right there there we go close icon good nice okay good gotta go i like it okay uh let's need to actually make sure this one gets aligned not there but actually somewhere else so to do this one we'll do let's see let's see let's see just kind of thinking here and this one we need to wrap it in that case so let's do we'll create a closed wrapper close wrapper because we need to actually shift this to the right hand side right so if i go ahead and do it this way so i'll get this bishop to here right we need to put that here you know to shift that properly how is it going to work well to shift it properly right i'm going to create a div around it a wrapper and then display flex it and put it here that's i'm going to create it okay just so you know that's a pretty good way of doing this kind of stuff right so just so you know custom close okay so if you want to like align something remember this rule wrap it if you want to align something wrap it you need to there's always need to be a parent wrapper in order to align something vertically horizontally left right whatever might have to be right okay close wrapper let's go ahead and create that close wrapper right here okay so close wrapper so const close wrapper is equal to styled dot div now look at this one now you see check this one out okay all i do at this point is very simple i say the following i say display flex flex and here's what i do check this one out okay let's play flex and we'll say um justify content content what flex end boom right there see just as simple as that that's it and now that's there okay next up let's go ahead and do the following we'll do um let's do on the actual custom close we'll do what cursor pointer pointer save that nice right there there you go beautiful beautiful good good good good good awesome sweet look at this oh my gosh this looks good guys this looks so good all right who's still with me you guys still with me i hope so let's go all right all right so we got this portion now we need to figure out how do we close it well we're going to use use state to make sure that we understand when is there when there is a closing factor or when there is an open factor right so for example let's go and do this let's use your state to figure out when i click on this i'm going to trigger a use state to say hey you know i'll close it right if i open it i'm going to say that we have an open state now that's what's going to happen now okay so let's do this i'm going to say you stay it's going to open import you state here use state beautiful okay all right nice nice nice nice and at this point you just feel a few very simple things okay god this is so clean guys by the way such a clean such clean coat which i really love by the way all right so we have use state and the site here let's do the following boom and we'll do const here i'm going to create our use state so we'll say burger status so for the burger i'll say open burger open or sat um said i'll just say booger status i think it's good i kind of like that one status right there and with a set burger status at brooker stat this right there it's equal to what use state initially we'll set it to false so right now right now it's actually closed so story status is closed right there right so that's what's going to happen okay so process is closed now how do we go ahead and make sure that you know that this stuff is actually closed or open well very simple is what we can do is the following so look at this on the burger nav i'm going to pass in a wrapper here i'll pass in a parameter here and this can be show is equal to the status of the burger status say burger status burger status right there i guess that is inside the burger now we're gonna have all i'm going to do is check this one out i'm gonna say for example here um if we have so look at this one i'm going to transform it some say transform check this one out transform okay i'm going to look for the prop so props like so but we just have done before and basically here's what we'll say if if it says prop start show props dot show right it basically says props or show we're going to do what transform you know nothing so here's what we'll do we'll do ifssprops.show we'll just make it you know show basically um translate x0 so here's what we'll do so translate translate x oh it needs to be like this right here translate x 0 and what does that do so if i go to translate x go ahead and do it this way otherwise we'll do translate x 100 translate x 100 okay okay let's see so right now it's false okay oh now it's false okay so what just happened let me see and make sure it's all good let me see i think i need to actually go hey let's go so now now look you see so right now translate x basically if it's show we have translate x0 so translate x what does that what does that pretty much do um let me go and show it to you tran is late x right here look at this one guys this is pretty cool right so i can move something basically so right here for example i can translate x 10 pixels i'm going to translate 10 pixels to the right hand side right and so what's gonna happen is is the following if i go ahead and actually if i do for example if i do show and i say here a hundred percent boom let's go and see this see this see this props does show is it working at all let's see am i missing something um processor should be false if it's false i think it should be translate zero yes yes yes yes yes there you go so let's get this out so this will do if props does show basically we're not part of the show is false right now of course so what's gonna happen is it's going to translate what zero it won't move it at all right right so that's going to happen if it's false it won't move it at all that's that's that's that's kind of what happened of course but we're going to say this if it's false what happens actually if it's true if it's if we say props dot show right then we actually need to move it not nothing because basically we do nothing right so if it's true we don't do nothing to this right this stays the way it should be right but the second this is false this is false we need to move to the right hand side it's full width right here see that's why he shows it that way now check this out what we can do now at this point is we can have another click so when i go ahead and i click open so this come on click button so unclick unclick is equal to what right tata when i say right well i'm going to say what i'm going to do the following i'm going to say sad broker status to true that is to true so set it to true okay true so means if i click on this i know icon set the progress status to be true minis mini open so let's try this right now oh look at that see that means open right there how cool is that that means open okay now closes now work right now because of course close nothing right so now to actually change that to make that fully happen what to do on the on the click of this one what we're going to say is equal to what boom we'll say what status what cyborg status to what to false there we go look at this now right so now we change it to false i'll do this how cool is this guys burger status is now officially what officially now true or false now again this is where we now make it very beautiful look at this one let's go ahead and make it very beautiful now okay guys how good is it starting to look aren't you aren't you pumped aren't you like like excited for this and by the way we're almost at a thousand likes guys 977 let's go ahead and make sure we have that you know let's get to 1k it's not that much come on you guys got this it's been working really hard now all right so that's good 977 likes let's go all right to make it flow very nicely we just add a small transition tool check this out you see this transform all i do is look transition i say the following transition trend position and i do what on the transform factor transitions form and i will say what 0.2 seconds i'm gonna say ease in right now you ready for this my friend are you ready for the reveal all right oh look at that boom boom boom boom boom i kind of want to make it even better though i kind of want to make it look even better let me see let's see i want to say ease and ease out i will say easing is dash out i don't like that better no here oh that's not it hold on um let's see there we go much better i like oh let's go that looks so good how cool is that guys let's go ahead and give us a thumbs up for the following and we're at a thousand likes you guys are amazing as always just want to say something easy now thank you hey let's go how cool is that beautiful it looks so good okay now let's go ahead and actually add some data to this right we're going to add some redux to this all right but pretty much look at this we're almost pretty much done we're so close to finishing this a tesla clone uh it's so clean the the code is clean that's the really cool part about this all right um a few things now we're gonna do is the following let's go ahead and add some data to it about like our cars right so as you can see here we have for example you know we might have cars for example car titles so here for example model s and so forth right model asmr and so forth now let's go ahead and create uh our redux store that will contain the cars that we will be using here okay we'll be using here so here's what we'll do let's go ahead and look at the redux the component that we need to create so let's go features and the one that we have currently is like a weird one that's like a counter feature we don't need that one at all so we can actually fix that one let's go put it at the hand side we can't fix that one um don't get the counter instead let's go ahead and create a new folder on the features folder and let's call it for example car slice car slice right there okay counter you can remove that one so let's go ahead right click um delete move to trash now we only just have car slices that's nothing we need so inside the car so let's go ahead create new file and what actually now let's do let's see uh let's rename this to car rename this to car not car slice car and inside here we'll create a new file called car slice car slice dot gs beautiful okay all right let's go to our app go to store and remove this counter reducer because we don't need that one okay okay good on the counter slice on the car slice all right we need to of course import redux toolkit so let's go ahead and read the import redux toolkit for create create slice and what slice is is basically in redux is imagine reading is like this whole state of data that you have right imagine redux is like for example you know where this is this whole state right and the slice is just one smaller state right one small one piece of the state so in our case our slice will be for example just car for now and that's why it's called slices right it's like a slight slice of pizza right and every single for example when you're trying to save data in the global state of the whole website right you might have a car slice you might have an inventory slice who know for example right inventory you know and so forth and so forth and all that is just data that's shared across all your web pages websites all your pages on your site that's pretty much it okay so let me create a slice that's what's happening here all right beautiful let's go ahead and go next the next one we'll go ahead and do is we've got the car slice that's great um let's create initial state so we'll do const initial state and we'll give it a few cars so we'll say um cars i'm giving the cars right here and this will be actually an array of objects x just actually just honestly just an array of cars so say for example model which one what do we have model s model three right model s model 3 model x model y so model s model s model 3 okay model x model x and then model y model y there we go all right so we got ourselves the cars okay let's go ahead and now get this car so to create the actual slice we'll do const car slice car slice is equal to what's going to create the slice right we'll create a slice of pizza right create slice right there and that takes a few different things the amount we're going to name it let's name the slice right there this could be car for now okay and then we'll give an initial state and then she'll state right there okay and then we'll give a few reduces now we don't need any reducers at this point right because our goal right now is just to get the cars that's it so we don't need anything like that of that sort that's way too complicated instead once that well what we will however do is we'll get the cars themselves so say export const and the trajectory or how usually you do it inside slices inside without toolkit is you for example do select so it's like selecting a piece of object selecting a piece of data so in our case i'm selecting cars right here okay is equal to what is equal to state is equal state and then it's going to return to me this will turn to be the state state.car the car is the name of the slice right here dot cars that's it that's going to be this right here that's with this whole array that's pretty much it okay so this right here is mapping directly to this right here and select cars will have that for us that's it and of course we're going to export now default uh we could ask for the reducer because we need to actually access some kind of reducer even though it's empty default and we'll say car slice dot reducer beautiful nice all right once we've got that we need to actually import this let's go ahead and go to store and we'll do import import and this will be the car reducer so we'll say car car reducer right here from what okay we need to go back now we need to go into features let me go ahead let me see this i need to go back let me go into features right here and for that we need to go into the car right there car um and then we go car slice beautiful right there and so instead of this kind of reducer we just change it to car reducer car is gonna be car reducer right there right so that's pretty much all you have to do on the redux reducer side okay so just keep that in mind always okay guys uh you know the store you tell what producers you have okay the slice is basically every individual reducer you can see right individual slice and this contains the actions and i'm not going to go deep into redux of course that there will be another video of itself um but redux there's always a few different things we also have we always have the initial state that's a state that you will have when you initially start the application and you will have reducers and reduce strategically just functions you can use to manipulate the state maybe you have a function that will add a new car you know or something something else so that's what kind of the redux reducer is there for right there's also actions but we'll talk about those later most important thing is the fact that we have select cars which will get us the cars individually okay nice okay so all right at this point we are pretty much almost done let's go to home.gs and what we need to do is the following let's go to section here section here uh no actually not here uh header header right here we're going to import our car slice so so let's go import import okay and we'll say select cars right this will give us the actual car select cars from from what from features right here slash car slash car slice good and we need to actually import you selector so in order to select something that's usually something called the use selector which is a hook which is a react hook right here good good right here so you selector and then we're going to select the actual car so we'll say const cars is equal to what use selector from what well select cars boom done you see that's it right we've started the cars from the actual use selector right so if we now console.log it that's going to consolidate the cars cars okay console login right now let's go ahead and right click inspect down on this one console let's go ahead and see how this works out let's go ahead and refresh it it says legacy context api has been deducted within this restrict mode 3 don't worry about this one but look at this here it is model s model 3 model x y beautiful that's all we need to do let's see this is some fade stuff we don't need to do this one should mitigate to the new version all the piano will be 24 that's fine right so right there here's our array and now all we do is for example for this which so now here as we'll do if cars cars and and cars dot map right i'm gonna get the individual car car and then i'm gonna get the index boom done all right enter karma the index and then that's gonna give us what okay good so then i will go ahead and do a shrap doom right here i will give it some kind of a thing like this okay that closes that beautiful there we go so model s okay now check this out all we gotta do now at this point is just give it a car ah oops car and i can remove this now done so now let's see oh let's go another thing we want to figure out is give the key so because if i right clicked inspect them on this one the console here see it says each child in the list should have a unique key the reason why they do that is because react actually tracks individual child by the key so let's say any changes happened it will know where to make those changes i'm going to do that by using the index like this right there see so if i inspect them but now okay the console and let's go ahead i refresh this again see the child is no longer that issue is no longer there beautiful let's remove this console of cars guys we're almost done so close to being done and finishing up this tesla clone that is pretty pretty insane i will say all right and the next thing i'm going to do is i'm we'll do the same thing with this specific situation here with this cars and i'll put in here cars that map but in my case i'm going to use it like this boom and this will be the actual car itself car right there and again a lie and then we're going to give it a key is equal to the actual index boom boom boom boom don't need any of this stuff boom right here that's that's it and so this is going to be that let's go ahead and take a look at that one so cars down map so let's go see oh would you look at that guys look at what we have got for ourselves let's go ahead and do add and that's going to be uh redux for cars right there but yes cut b look at what we have got four ourselves whoo oh my god look at that guys look at this model s model three we have some beautiful animations look at that oh my god two two two two all this stuff and if you compare it to an actual tesla page i mean let's go ahead and take a look at the tesla page actual tesla page let's take a look at it here look at that like what like okay just compare it here like hold on look look like what guys do you see the magic that we have just done like can you tell the difference i mean yes we have this fancy feature like the scrolling feature we can work on that later but look it's there i actually hate i actually hate this kind of um slim features or like where they you know they don't allow you to scroll i hate that oh let's go look at oh my god how good is this guys this is so fresh so clean you know it uh guys that is pretty pretty insane wow wow wow looking dope nas jessica's dope that's awesome sweet howdy hello colleen let's go let's go beautiful so what we've got like i said we've got everything we finished the application it looks so good it looks clean model s model y model three model x guys you put this on your portfolio it's gonna be a winning portfolio for yourself this is going to be a winning portfolio put this on your portfolio you're going to just it's going to be so good that's all i can tell you all right look at that oh my god yes oh my god it's so good that's so beautiful guys that's

me go ahead and comment with you guys show store the gs everybody somebody said show the gs okay sure i can show that no problem to show store the gs so the gs resistor the gs right there that's it there's nothing crazy about this guy store the gs that's it that's it store.js right here like this car reducer that's all it is you have to import the reducer right here and then set it right there that's all you gotta do okay that's pretty much it guys look at this by the way i don't know if you can see this but this is also uh oh this is actual tesla phone this is actually also like user friendly too not user friendly but mobile friendly as well which is pretty insane oh so good so good guys who think this is an amazing build who enjoyed it let me know thumbs up the video if you enjoyed this specific build i sure did i really did actually it was really really good it was really good let me see all you guys saying here all right nice there's a building for jingle clone that's going to happen definitely sweetness thank you awesome adrian i'm happy you enjoyed it nas let's go muhammad yes go super thanks nas awesome sweet thank you thank you thank you some set luisa elbow cough that's awesome uh with portfolio yes i do mean github put this on your github put in your portfolio because some people you might have portfolios where you showcase the actual application so definitely put that there let's see super clean super fancy i agree with that nice nice nice nice night let's go nice let's go lulac is currently in full stack mastery let's go hey hey let's go look i love you too bro super clean now that's what i'm talking about there's two kid that's an actual an import that's going to take a look at this on google.com it's an import guys it's a new way to do redux it's pretty awesome thank you so much i'm not number one fan oh let's go daniel okay thank you i'm your fan i'm your number one fan number number two maybe number two fan oh my god all right guys that's it from me uh hope you guys have a great day and i'll see you in the next video
