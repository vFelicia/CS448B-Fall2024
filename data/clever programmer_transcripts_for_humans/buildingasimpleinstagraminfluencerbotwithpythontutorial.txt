00:00 - [Music]
00:10 - hey guys so here's our challenge I want
00:13 - to promote my new online product and
00:14 - find top influences to do that as you
00:17 - may don't know who answers marketing is
00:19 - getting more and more popular and
00:20 - basically you can find influencers pay
00:23 - them and they will promote your products
00:25 - for example there are beauty influencers
00:27 - tech influencers even Fitness influences
00:30 - so the idea is to use Python and create
00:33 - online database which stores all of the
00:36 - influences in a selected nation checked
00:38 - already online products and there are a
00:40 - couple of them but all of them are not
00:42 - free so why shouldn't we do our own
00:44 - let's do it
00:46 - [Music]
00:59 - so first of all we have to make some
01:01 - research about influencer marketing what
01:03 - I mean by that is how to actually find
01:05 - good influences and what is necessary to
01:07 - know about them I mean we can find out
01:09 - about some indicators like daily growth
01:12 - average likes for post engagement ratio
01:15 - those indicators are necessary to know
01:17 - if our influences are not using any BOTS
01:20 - or they are not buying any likes or
01:22 - followers and in order to do that we
01:24 - have to gather the data in Instagram in
01:25 - a time for example in a period of one
01:28 - week then we will know that they are not
01:30 - using any boss they are not buying likes
01:32 - there are a couple of ways to implement
01:34 - that one of them is using Instagram API
01:37 - or third-party libraries from github or
01:40 - we can even implement our own API then
01:43 - we have to also think about technologies
01:44 - that I will use python django Django
01:47 - rest framework and then got a choose
01:49 - database probably Postgres SQL or MySQL
01:52 - or even SQLite we got a plan all the
01:55 - relations and database models and then
01:59 - we got to think about the script which
02:00 - will actually gather all the data
02:02 - remember we don't want to make just one
02:04 - single request because then the data
02:06 - won't be accurate we gotta use some
02:09 - additional service such as cron jobs to
02:11 - be able to make requests every few hours
02:13 - and govern good data and of course we
02:17 - gotta think about deploy of our
02:19 - application probably will use AWS
02:21 - services such as PC to
02:23 - [Music]
02:39 - sir turned out that Instagram API allows
02:42 - us to do only 200 calls per hour which
02:46 - is in my case not enough so I also
02:49 - decided to check existing libraries
02:51 - existing repositories in a github but
02:55 - they didn't satisfy me so I decided to
02:57 - implement my own I plant a rough ink on
03:05 - a white board and we will need one API
03:08 - and three scripts which I'll talk about
03:10 - just in a minute
03:12 - [Music]
03:18 - [Music]
03:30 - so our models look like this we get a
03:32 - category for a selected niche for
03:35 - example tag then we have Instagram
03:36 - accounts which is pretty clear
03:38 - we have Instagram posts which we'll be
03:40 - updating together with Instagram
03:43 - accounts and of course we have Instagram
03:45 - account reports to know how many
03:48 - followers do we have on Monday then on
03:50 - Tuesday Wednesday and so on
03:52 - so we can somehow calculate the growth
03:55 - the daily growth and of course we have
03:57 - hashtags to discover new accounts
04:03 - [Music]
04:16 - oh hey before we continue this video is
04:21 - sponsored by Atlantic dog net a planting
04:24 - dotnet provides great VPS hosting and
04:27 - they are very a free one gig virtual
04:29 - server with SSDs and block storages for
04:32 - free for a year a free snapshots for one
04:35 - year plus $25 and free credits to use
04:38 - their other services try Atlantic dotnet
04:41 - to develop test or launch your next
04:44 - projects ease of use is something I like
04:46 - as it frees up my mind to focus on my
04:48 - code that's really valuable to me
04:50 - especially when I'm coding and I don't
04:52 - want to get stuck so don't waste your
04:55 - time go to Atlantic dotnet slash clever
04:58 - programmer and enter code Kwasi to get
05:01 - $25 credits which is just special for
05:04 - this channel I asked these guys to do
05:07 - something special for you guys and they
05:09 - did so try them out so now we gotta
05:12 - create the first scraper and it will be
05:14 - a scraper which finds the new hashtags
05:16 - for a certain category let's say well we
05:18 - want to find the influencers related to
05:21 - technology we have to supply it with the
05:24 - first hashtag let's say coding and as we
05:27 - can see here in Polish this is the
05:31 - related hashtags so we can create a
05:33 - recursive function which will work like
05:36 - this we do coding then we iterate
05:37 - through all of them for example then we
05:40 - create a click on computer science and
05:42 - again we iterate through all of them and
05:44 - go deeper deeper deeper and in the end
05:46 - we have set of the hashtags related to
05:48 - our category
05:50 - [Music]
06:08 - [Music]
06:15 - so our next scraper is a scraper which
06:18 - actually finds I influences finds good
06:21 - accounts and in order to do that
06:23 - instagrammed gives us the popular posts
06:26 - whenever we are in a hashtags and
06:28 - explore page first nine posts are
06:32 - promoted by Instagram so we can iterate
06:35 - for them and we can get on those
06:37 - accounts and add them to our database so
06:41 - as you can see there are totally
06:44 - different accounts and we'll be adding
06:45 - them
06:47 - [Music]
06:56 - that script aesthetic route which will
06:59 - actually update our account here which
07:03 - is the most important thing will be
07:05 - updated every few hours would be
07:09 - checking every few hours if the accounts
07:11 - were actually updated or not and so
07:14 - here's the API view but there's also
07:17 - like the script view which will ask the
07:20 - database if the accounts were updated
07:22 - and if they weren't then it will update
07:25 - them and also we'll do reports we'll get
07:28 - a new info board posts and everything so
07:44 - let's run our script and yeah as you can
07:46 - see it's updating their accounts or
07:49 - checking if they were updated and as you
07:51 - can see also added me which means that I
07:54 - may be the influencer related to tag as
07:56 - I saw it added some of my friends which
08:00 - I also follow so we are basically it's
08:02 - pretty cool and now let's see how it
08:04 - looks like in a API so this is the API
08:09 - view from Django rest framework here I
08:11 - set the category technology which we
08:13 - added next are we going to take a look
08:16 - at our accounts so we got a couple of
08:20 - accounts here we got also Mead
08:26 - [Music]
08:29 - we can also order our accounts for
08:33 - example by daily growth and this crazy
08:36 - account grows more than 1000 followers
08:38 - every single day so it's a huge page we
08:42 - of course has our reports we have posts
08:44 - and hashtags alright guys so it turns
08:50 - out our group is actually working we got
08:52 - everything we can right now promote our
08:54 - favorite online product because we got
08:56 - influences the one thing which I have
08:59 - discovered is we don't truly get own
09:01 - influence account we also get those huge
09:04 - aggregations account we just re repost
09:07 - other accounts but I guess it's still
09:09 - fine for a short project and yeah guys
09:11 - it's open source project so you can go
09:12 - to my github and get the whole for free
09:14 - and even develop it by own add some new
09:17 - features and yeah let me know some
09:19 - comments what do you think and subscribe
09:20 - to my channel and thanks for watching
09:25 - [Music]
