00:00 - so I am walking back and forth my heart
00:05 - is literally pumping out of my chest at
00:09 - this point and I know I have to make
00:12 - this phone call but I don't want to do
00:14 - it I've just gotten this job today I
00:18 - found out and I've gotten it at $50 an
00:22 - hour and my mentor against everybody
00:26 - else's advice has told me charge them
00:30 - $100 an hour don't charge them 50 and I
00:35 - remember my family going what are you
00:37 - doing you're looking a gift horse in the
00:39 - mouth your 20 year old Oakton Community
00:43 - College student with a terrible GPA you
00:46 - are lucky and you should accept this as
00:50 - is and my mentor is telling me look
00:52 - you're good and this is what you should
00:55 - be charging as a software Python
00:58 - developer freelancer and even though
01:01 - this is your very first job this is
01:03 - possible so again you can imagine I've
01:06 - already gotten it $50 an hour full-time
01:08 - and now I have to make this call and
01:10 - tell them look I want $100 an hour and
01:14 - literally palms are sweating I pick up
01:18 - the phone call and I'm like listen I
01:24 - know that we agreed to 50 but because of
01:28 - the workload that's involved I'm gonna
01:31 - have to go with $100 an hour because
01:34 - this requires a lot of work
01:37 - I'm gonna be doing some Python
01:38 - consulting I'm your trusted advisor and
01:40 - for everything that needs to be done
01:43 - that's gonna be the rape and at the
01:45 - other line he just hung up or he not
01:47 - even hang up immediately but he goes
01:49 - okay we're gonna have to look at our
01:51 - budget and I'll give you a call back we
01:54 - hung up I spent 24 hours and just agony
01:58 - thinking about what is gonna happen am I
02:01 - gonna get this job am I not gonna get
02:03 - this job did I just throw everything
02:05 - away this amazing opportunity and the
02:10 - next day I come home from college I
02:13 - haven't even told this to my parents yet
02:15 - that I have done this I haven't told
02:17 - this to my friends I've been told this
02:19 - to anybody and the next day I seed my
02:22 - phone and I see this text message and it
02:24 - says it's a long message but it
02:27 - ultimately says congratulations you've
02:31 - got it and we're starting this Wednesday
02:36 - that was the moment where for me
02:40 - everything changed literally my whole
02:43 - life changed because here I was willing
02:46 - to work for free to do coding because I
02:48 - loved being able to take something
02:50 - that's in my head and bringing it out to
02:52 - the real world bringing it out and
02:55 - making it a reality and then everybody
02:57 - else around me can use it okay so I
02:59 - would do it for free
03:00 - I wouldn't only do it for free I love it
03:02 - so much that I would pay right I would
03:05 - actually pay somebody to let me work on
03:08 - a project like this and not only was I
03:12 - not having to pay out of my own pocket
03:14 - not only was it not just a free job but
03:16 - I was gonna be getting paid to do this
03:18 - so unbelievable moment the lesson that I
03:22 - learned out of this is that if I didn't
03:25 - have a mentor right this would not be
03:29 - possible for me he was somebody who
03:31 - helped me accelerate my progress by
03:33 - years literally helped me cut my
03:35 - lifetime and have something that would
03:37 - have taken me 10 20 years to achieve
03:39 - maybe five years he helped me get it way
03:42 - faster of charge what I'm worth and
03:44 - again
03:45 - money is not only important because you
03:47 - just want to have a pile of it and sit
03:48 - on it because you don't only want to be
03:50 - able to take care of yourself but those
03:52 - around you okay
03:55 - and my having that mentor was key for me
03:59 - so in your life if you want to achieve
04:01 - something and you want to get there look
04:04 - for that mentor who can guide you in the
04:07 - right direction
