00:00 - hey guys how's it going
00:03 - this is Kazi from clever programmer comm
00:07 - it's been a while so super excited to
00:12 - have you guys here with me I wanted to
00:16 - talk about well first of all I trying to
00:19 - say that we had a great you know course
00:24 - launch course closing it was closing
00:26 - down it was the old P course and we got
00:29 - tons of new students in our Python
00:31 - course okie course I'll link it below so
00:34 - you can check it out but at this point
00:37 - you're watching the video it probably is
00:39 - closed down but you can register and
00:41 - beyond the waiting list and if there is
00:44 - a early bird discount that could be
00:46 - yours as well but what I wanted to talk
00:49 - about today was um so I don't know if
00:54 - some of you guys remember but we had the
00:55 - 0.5% guy who just to quickly give you a
00:59 - reminder was this person who wanted me
01:03 - to work with him and like build this
01:05 - entire project and basically be 50 50 %
01:09 - partners at the very worst even though
01:12 - you know I'm really strong about your
01:14 - ideas or a lot or your execution is a
01:18 - lot more important than your you know
01:20 - your your ideas because everybody has an
01:23 - idea everybody has the next million
01:24 - dollar idea but it's the execution and
01:27 - the work I think that people lack to
01:29 - then systematically and methodically
01:31 - pursue that idea and turn it into a
01:33 - reality right the physical manifestation
01:37 - so that guy has striked again he struck
01:44 - again
01:44 - and last time he told me he wanted me to
01:47 - do all of this stuff and he said that
01:49 - you would be very generous and give me
01:52 - 0.5% of that and I thought wow what a
01:56 - guy you know I do all the work and
01:59 - basically I get 0.5% makes total sense
02:03 - for me somehow so I you know I didn't
02:07 - end up doing anything with him but then
02:09 - he actually hit me up again
02:12 - and in my you know he emailed me again
02:16 - and he's like hey how about we do you
02:19 - know I thought about it and you're right
02:21 - how about we do one percent for you this
02:25 - time
02:26 - so my price has gone up to one percent
02:30 - and if this rate keeps up in the next 10
02:34 - years or 20 years I might be I might be
02:39 - lucky enough to get 10 percent for doing
02:43 - all of the work the takeaway for you
02:46 - guys
02:47 - is make sure that you're not having make
02:53 - sure that you're putting in the work
02:54 - yourself even if you have an idea again
02:57 - this is something I get hit up with a
02:58 - lot like hey I have this amazing idea
03:00 - global blob and then there's like no
03:02 - action that's followed up with it and no
03:04 - VC venture capitalist is going to give
03:06 - you money unless your idea is that a
03:08 - point where it's actually generating
03:10 - revenue right like for example my
03:12 - business clever programmer now is that a
03:14 - point where I can actually talk to
03:16 - venture capitalists because we have a
03:17 - pretty solid business model and not
03:19 - turning it in into like a more real
03:22 - thing you know it's not just a person
03:24 - I'm not just making like random YouTube
03:26 - videos my YouTube videos have gotten
03:29 - better we have a business model in place
03:31 - we have employees on the team and we
03:33 - actually apply to Lightspeed so we're
03:35 - waiting to hear back from them but
03:37 - essentially if they accept us they give
03:39 - us twenty thousand dollars fifteen
03:40 - thousand dollars for one of the
03:42 - employees that I'll bring with me and or
03:46 - a partner essentially and so this is
03:48 - like they'll give us thirty five
03:50 - thousand dollars and they'll move us to
03:52 - California will where we will have an
03:55 - office space and everything provided by
03:56 - them they'll give us the best mentors
03:58 - and everybody and Lightspeed was
04:00 - actually behind snapchat so when
04:02 - snapchat was a little baby and I'm
04:04 - starting out there really accelerated
04:06 - that right these are called accelerators
04:08 - for a reason because they accelerate
04:09 - your progress it's actually where my
04:13 - mentorship my personal coaching thing is
04:15 - inspired from it's called accelerator
04:16 - mentorship and the idea is you work
04:18 - one-on-one with me and I help you land
04:20 - your first job or your first consulting
04:22 - client or whatever right
04:24 - um so you know now it is at a point
04:29 - where we can make that pitch but we have
04:31 - revenue to show we have customers to
04:36 - show and we have like we have over
04:38 - 10,000 students enrolled in our program
04:40 - like so it's been going awesome and it's
04:44 - because of you guys you guys are joining
04:46 - the program checking out the website
04:47 - right if some of you guys don't know
04:49 - clever programmer comm that's you can
04:52 - get the Python courses that I'm working
04:53 - on you can get mostly now it's like
04:56 - focus towards Python and my goal is to
04:58 - get you guys to a point where you guys
05:01 - are able to create your own apps and
05:03 - then turn them into you know put them on
05:07 - your resume so I teach you how to create
05:10 - desktop apps and then we go and make web
05:12 - applications with Python and then I
05:15 - immediately start teaching you how you
05:16 - can actually use it to get consulting
05:18 - work freelancing work or improve your
05:20 - negotiation skills soft skills so you
05:22 - then you can land that job with the
05:24 - specific Python skills that you got you
05:25 - know I don't want it to be like here let
05:28 - me just teach you a bunch of stuff and
05:29 - overload you in the information and then
05:30 - you figure out what to do with it I want
05:32 - it to be so you can actually use it to
05:34 - actually start getting work but again
05:38 - now we have a solid MVP with actual
05:41 - results technically we think a lot of
05:43 - the things are done business model like
05:45 - it's still in its infant stages but some
05:47 - of the groundwork is laid down so now
05:49 - when I go and pitch it to somebody they
05:52 - can see revenue they can see customers
05:55 - they can see certain results certain
05:57 - growth they are willing to invest in it
06:00 - but let's say I had no idea I hadn't
06:04 - done any work and I just had an idea
06:05 - nobody cares right you could have the
06:08 - greatest idea in the world but nobody
06:09 - would care so a lot of you guys that's
06:14 - actually one of the reasons why I
06:15 - learned wanting to learn programming so
06:16 - I could have the technical skills to
06:18 - build a real business because I couldn't
06:21 - hire outsource it to anybody I didn't
06:23 - have the money and so I built those
06:25 - skills so I could build a business and
06:27 - at least get it to a point where I could
06:29 - hire developers and I could hire people
06:31 - you know right now I could do most of
06:34 - the development myself but that's not
06:35 - where
06:36 - my time is best used so I have
06:39 - developers on the team who actually help
06:42 - out as well but up until now you know
06:45 - there have been a lot of programming
06:46 - work involved lots of technical things
06:48 - that I would have never in a million
06:50 - years been able to do without having you
06:52 - know technical knowledge and programming
06:54 - knowledge right so for you guys you have
07:00 - a business idea or whatever that's epic
07:02 - but just please focus on building a real
07:05 - thing get the technical skills you need
07:06 - to get that idea going and turn into a
07:09 - real thing and then hit up somebody who
07:12 - you know you want help from or you know
07:17 - then hit up a venture capitalist they'll
07:19 - be much more likely to listen and always
07:23 - be thinking what's in it for the other
07:24 - person like I get these emails that are
07:27 - like hey do you want to collab
07:31 - it's in my literally the email says do
07:33 - you want to collaborate because I think
07:35 - it's in my best interest to collaborate
07:37 - with you because you have a big audience
07:39 - you know what I did I I mean I don't
07:43 - even reply because like that person
07:46 - hasn't even taken a second to think
07:48 - about what I would want what would be my
07:50 - incentive to collaborate with that
07:51 - person whereas you know when I'm making
07:54 - this channel there's not a single time
07:56 - where I'm thinking about myself I'm
07:57 - thinking about what would you guys need
08:00 - what could I do that would help solve
08:03 - your problem that's like the only reason
08:05 - this channel is growing and is getting
08:08 - people like you watching and getting
08:10 - value out of it because I'm never
08:12 - putting myself first if I was nobody
08:14 - would care and you wouldn't care but now
08:18 - that you know me you know maybe you care
08:20 - about certain things and that's what
08:21 - happens when you build a relationship
08:22 - and you offer something of value to
08:24 - another person then you have that power
08:26 - to make the ask to make the relationship
08:29 - right whether it's an ask for a sale
08:31 - whether it's an ask for their business
08:34 - or you know your clients business or
08:36 - your employee you know a job or maybe
08:40 - it's just you know you guys becoming
08:42 - friends and having a great long-term
08:44 - relationship but you get that right or
08:46 - even that right you know being able to
08:49 - help someone
08:50 - yells the right to ask for help that
08:52 - happens when you give a certain amount
08:54 - of value first right so value first then
08:57 - other things later okay so how can you
09:03 - use this in actionable way take a look
09:05 - at your current resumes right I sent out
09:07 - an email about this actually today take
09:09 - a look at your current resumes and just
09:11 - read how much of it is about yourself
09:13 - versus how much of it is about like the
09:16 - person who's trying to hire you right
09:18 - think about how you can offer them value
09:21 - first before making that you know
09:25 - essentially that ask or talking about
09:27 - how great you are like for example I'll
09:29 - see things like intuitive intuitive
09:32 - understanding of economics and finances
09:36 - you know there's so many like there's so
09:39 - much jargon that people use but why
09:41 - don't you say something like I have an
09:47 - understanding of supply and demand and I
09:49 - can apply it to your business because
09:51 - your business is about digital products
09:53 - and I can help you price your product
09:57 - better than who almost fell in Tynan the
10:00 - water guys that would have not been good
10:02 - but yeah you could have been like the
10:05 - price of the product I can help you with
10:07 - that and by doing you know analytics on
10:10 - your website and based on the traffic
10:12 - you're getting in your current
10:13 - conversion rate I could help you boost
10:17 - your conversions or your opt-ins or your
10:20 - traffic which would essentially boost
10:23 - your revenue so if you boost your
10:26 - revenue five times is it okay if you pay
10:29 - me one time the money of that and hire
10:31 - me and if somebody were to come up and
10:34 - give me that pitch I'd be like yes
10:36 - that's a no-brainer so think of it like
10:39 - that when you're trying to apply for our
10:41 - job think of value first if you can give
10:43 - them a good reason don't let them
10:45 - connect the dots right don't leave it up
10:47 - to your employer to connect the dots of
10:50 - how they're going to use your skill sell
10:52 - yourself tell them what how your skills
10:56 - are relevant to them and when you do
10:58 - that you make a mark
11:01 - all right with that I'm going to be
11:03 - signing off thank you guys so much for
11:04 - watching thank you guys so much for
11:07 - being here we're about to hit 30,000
11:09 - subscribers I love your faces off
11:11 - this is Kazi and as always I'll see you
11:15 - in the next video
11:18 - [Applause]

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer comm it's been a while so super excited to have you guys here with me I wanted to talk about well first of all I trying to say that we had a great you know course launch course closing it was closing down it was the old P course and we got tons of new students in our Python course okie course I'll link it below so you can check it out but at this point you're watching the video it probably is closed down but you can register and beyond the waiting list and if there is a early bird discount that could be yours as well but what I wanted to talk about today was um so I don't know if some of you guys remember but we had the 0.5% guy who just to quickly give you a reminder was this person who wanted me to work with him and like build this entire project and basically be 50 50 % partners at the very worst even though you know I'm really strong about your ideas or a lot or your execution is a lot more important than your you know your your ideas because everybody has an idea everybody has the next million dollar idea but it's the execution and the work I think that people lack to then systematically and methodically pursue that idea and turn it into a reality right the physical manifestation so that guy has striked again he struck again and last time he told me he wanted me to do all of this stuff and he said that you would be very generous and give me 0.5% of that and I thought wow what a guy you know I do all the work and basically I get 0.5% makes total sense for me somehow so I you know I didn't end up doing

you guys so much for watching thank you guys so much for being here we're about to hit 30,000 subscribers I love your faces off this is Kazi and as always I'll see you in the next video
