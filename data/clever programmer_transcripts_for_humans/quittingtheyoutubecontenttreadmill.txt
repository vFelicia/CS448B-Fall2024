00:00 - it's about time I thought I would make
00:03 - this video and just talk about a couple
00:05 - of things that have been on my mind for
00:08 - a minute
00:10 - okay so this is not like an April Fool's
00:13 - joke or anything that I did a while ago
00:15 - where I said I'm quitting YouTube and it
00:17 - was just an April Fool's joke
00:20 - but what I am quitting is I'm quitting
00:22 - being on the content treadmill that I
00:25 - got on with YouTube
00:31 - I realized a lot of things about life
00:35 - and I had lots of learning lessons over
00:37 - the last few years as I was growing
00:39 - clever programmer and I'll also kind of
00:41 - share what I see as the future and what
00:43 - I'll be doing on Clever programmer and
00:45 - what I will be doing in general uh
00:48 - probably outside of clever programmer
00:51 - and this video is for a lot of people
00:53 - like it's not just for developers I want
00:55 - to make this video for even other
00:57 - content creators if you're a YouTuber
00:58 - and you're a content creator and you're
01:01 - maybe a developer who's creating content
01:04 - on other channels or thinking about
01:05 - creating content I think this could be
01:07 - something useful for you and valuable
01:08 - for you to know
01:12 - I'm gonna be a little bit all over the
01:14 - place I'm sorry but I'll just stick to
01:16 - like what I want to say whatever's
01:18 - coming to my mind and uh
01:20 - and I and I hope it'll make sense
01:24 - but a few years ago I mean lots of years
01:26 - ago right when I started my coding
01:28 - Channel about six or seven years ago I
01:30 - was really excited about it really
01:31 - passionate about coding because I was
01:33 - coding every single day and um I was
01:36 - coding about 14 15 hours a day and
01:38 - always had these crazy epiphanies and
01:40 - discoveries that I wanted to share like
01:41 - when I was a beginner I was like oh my
01:43 - God I just wanted Fibonacci Sequence I
01:44 - have to share with somebody when I
01:46 - learned the recurse recursion and I
01:48 - remember being at McDonald's with uh
01:50 - uh like my ex-girlfriend a long time ago
01:54 - and like literally stopping at
01:55 - McDonald's and going like
01:57 - and she was like annoyed by it you know
01:59 - because I would talk so much about
02:00 - coding all the time and I like stopped
02:02 - her and I sat her down at McDonald's and
02:03 - we got fries
02:05 - and I was like 19 or 20 or something
02:08 - like that at that time and I was like
02:10 - I just learned recursion it's
02:12 -  crazy I have to show you and I
02:14 - sat her down and like opened up my
02:16 - napkin and then I like Drew out
02:17 - recursion I showed her like how it
02:19 - worked and it was so epic I was having
02:23 - so much fun I think she wasn't having
02:25 - that much fun
02:27 - and I broke it down exactly how it
02:29 - worked how I thought it worked because
02:31 - it just clicked in my head and I was
02:33 - like
02:33 - it's crazy just like how it unfolds all
02:37 - the way down until the base case and
02:39 - then it goes the other way oh it's
02:41 - beautiful it's amazing all right so one
02:42 - of the coolest things on planet Earth I
02:44 - want to like kind of figured it out and
02:45 - and I was a lot slower than everybody
02:47 - and I was dumber than everybody and so
02:48 - like you know other my friends would
02:51 - understand it and like after one's class
02:53 - session they've been like oh yes
02:55 - recursion it makes so much sense and for
02:58 - me
02:59 - it didn't make any sense it was
03:01 - something like
03:02 - that I had to spend like eight hours you
03:04 - know for so many days in a row and then
03:06 - two weeks three weeks later it finally
03:08 - clicked it I was like oh my gosh awesome
03:10 - I was sharing it with her and I was so
03:12 - fascinated I was blown away
03:14 - but I remember it was so I was so
03:16 - excited about that time right and I
03:18 - think that was the time
03:20 - I I wanted to share all these things and
03:22 - so what I did is I created a channel and
03:25 - that was brilliant timing for that
03:26 - channel
03:27 - because right when I was passionate
03:29 - about it I started creating content and
03:31 - so then every day I would share
03:32 - something that I was excited about so
03:34 - whether it was like an R programming
03:36 - language video I made a long time ago or
03:38 - I started teaching python because I was
03:40 - learning Python and then right when I
03:42 - got a job I started showing people how
03:44 - to get a job and it was it was all very
03:45 - passionate and real and very exciting
03:49 - then that was like 2016 27 some of it
03:53 - was 2017 then
03:54 - 2017 things changed because 2016 I was
03:58 - like a student and living this normal
04:00 - life and then at the end of 2016 my
04:02 - channel started taking off and I was
04:05 - starting to get like people following me
04:07 - and all that stuff
04:09 - and around the end of 2016 start of 2017
04:12 - I had a bunch of people hitting me up
04:15 - like hey let me do your marketing and
04:17 - work on your marketing funnels and let's
04:19 - launch a product and you should launch a
04:21 - course and this is how you make money
04:24 - and you should do this type of business
04:25 - model and I was also pretty interested
04:27 - in you know I was looking to zero to
04:29 - launch by ramit seti and all this stuff
04:30 - and I was excited and I know if you're
04:33 - on this developer Channel you're gonna
04:34 - be like what the hell are any of these
04:36 - things like I just want a code that's
04:38 - fine if you want to do that just go away
04:39 - from this video because like there's
04:41 - probably not going to be anything of
04:42 - interest to you because I'm not really
04:44 - going to be talking about coding that
04:45 - much in this video
04:46 - but I hope that some of it could still
04:48 - resonate with you because our passions
04:51 - change and I kind of want to talk about
04:52 - that
04:53 - and so
04:55 - that was a lot of fun for me that was
04:57 - that was a lot of fun because I would
04:59 - learn the stuff and share it and then
05:01 - implement it and then I got into like
05:03 - learning business because I was growing
05:05 - the YouTube channel and I was growing a
05:07 - course-based business online digital
05:09 - course business I was like this is
05:10 - exciting so I was learning about email
05:12 - lists and email marketing and content
05:15 - and content strategies and um how do you
05:18 - do a product launch successfully and how
05:19 - do you build a hype for it how do you
05:21 - deliver the product and how do you
05:22 - pre-sell a product and how do you
05:24 - fulfill customers and how do you upsell
05:27 - and how do you have customer retention
05:29 - so customers actually stick through and
05:31 - enjoy the product and the services you
05:33 - provide how do you lower the refund I
05:35 - mean everything business related and
05:37 - along with that came other things like
05:39 - managing a team
05:41 - um hiring an assistant hiring an editor
05:43 - then we need to scale so like getting
05:45 - more creative creators and then more and
05:48 - more and more and more
05:51 - and until I realized that
05:55 - it was
05:57 - just this constant thing of
06:00 - I have to do more I have to skill more I
06:03 - have to make more money the next month
06:04 - than the previous month because I have a
06:06 - payroll to pay now and I have to I have
06:09 - to I have to I have to
06:11 - and from back when like things were
06:15 - because I got to do them and because I
06:17 - wanted to do them and me going to Dunkin
06:20 - Donuts to solve a coding problem because
06:22 - I was trying to solve like the literal
06:24 - schemer book from like 6 p.m to 5am I
06:28 - was doing that you know I was like all
06:29 - because I wanted to do it
06:31 - and then at this point I didn't really
06:33 - want to do that stuff anymore and um
06:36 - everything was just a burden and so
06:38 - around like 2017 if you watch some of my
06:41 - videos like earlier kind of in 2017 like
06:43 - or mid 2017 I started to like kind of
06:45 - look depressed or sad or low energy
06:48 - because
06:50 - I was like I'm just being I feel so
06:54 - forced to be doing these things
06:56 - so that was great and then happened and
06:59 - then I ended up launching a course at
07:00 - the end of 2017 profitable programmer
07:02 - and that launch went great and we had a
07:04 - ton of students enroll and I decided to
07:06 - leave
07:07 - Chicago at that time and go to LA
07:10 - and then after that it was just like go
07:13 - go fast like be in a fast place like la
07:17 - get a bunch of creators you know be
07:19 - around bunch of creators hire a bigger
07:21 - team like par um you know and then
07:23 - because I got kind of new into like
07:25 - money and status and fame and all of
07:28 - those things were very new to me I
07:30 - didn't know what to do with them so 2018
07:31 - I was like partying and spending a lot
07:34 - of time dating and just doing a bunch of
07:36 - random that wasn't actually
07:38 - productive for my business or my health
07:41 - and um
07:43 - yeah I just had to prove people wrong
07:45 - and I'd show people what I could do and
07:46 - I got to show people what who I could be
07:48 - and
07:51 - and it wasn't the right way to spend a
07:54 - year but that's how 2018 went and you
07:55 - could see my content is like very little
07:58 - content that I did
08:01 - um and then as 2019 was like crazy 2019
08:06 - started kind of crazy at a breaking
08:08 - point because at the end of 2018 I kind
08:10 - of got depressed and it was I was really
08:12 - sad I lost my entire team everybody was
08:13 - like pretty much like you know what
08:15 - you everybody left the team and quit
08:17 - and so that 2019 I had to build all over
08:21 - again from scratch and then grow
08:25 - and so
08:26 - that made me realize okay I have to live
08:30 - a life of more purpose I have to do
08:32 - things that are aligned and I have to
08:34 - focus on discipline and building
08:36 - consistency and showing up for my team
08:38 - and being somebody who's reliable being
08:40 - somebody who people could count on
08:42 - and so then that became my focus
08:44 - starting in 2019.
08:46 - and I got some of the team members back
08:48 - whose trust I had lost I had I showed my
08:50 - character over time and discipline and I
08:53 - started getting more consistent again
08:54 - with content and here here's where
08:56 - things started to go started to change
08:58 - because see 2016 it was all about like
09:02 - coding and that was my passion 2017 it
09:05 - was about like
09:06 - proving these business Concepts right
09:08 - and kind of make them work and 2018 was
09:10 - like partying and discovering myself
09:13 - and seeing who I am and
09:16 - just a bunch of different stuff right
09:18 - like really going to the extreme
09:21 - and then 2019 I went back into being
09:23 - disciplined back into being all of that
09:26 - but at that point what happened was I
09:28 - was doing all those things it was
09:30 - discipline and I was being consistent I
09:31 - started this 30-day challenge where I
09:33 - wouldn't miss a single video every
09:34 - single day I would drop a video and
09:35 - start building the audience back up
09:37 - again and started dropping Banger
09:38 - content I dropped a Python tutorial and
09:40 - like boom things were blowing up in 2019
09:43 - again
09:44 - but see the interesting thing is I
09:47 - wasn't really passionate about coding
09:48 - anymore
09:49 - like truly truly truly passionate about
09:52 - coding anymore
09:54 - and
09:56 - it was a really scary thing because I'm
09:59 - like
10:00 - well I've been
10:01 - spending so much time building up this
10:03 - channel I can't quit now and everybody
10:05 - around me was just like your 100 000
10:07 - subscribers 200 000 subscribers like are
10:09 - you stupid you can't change now you can
10:11 - go do other things like you have to just
10:13 - keep going and keep going and I'm like
10:15 - but I'm not really feeling it that much
10:18 - anymore you know it's not something that
10:19 - drives me or excites me that much like I
10:22 - like coding but I don't get to do it my
10:25 - whole time is spent managing a team
10:27 - building a team
10:29 - um customers and meetings and all this
10:32 - other stuff and so I'm focused on
10:33 - self-development and business and
10:35 - Leadership and all this other stuff and
10:37 - like I'm excited to talk about it but
10:38 - now I don't have a platform to talk
10:40 - about it I have a platform to talk about
10:42 - what I wanted to talk about two years
10:44 - ago
10:45 - and then I was just stuck talking about
10:46 - it in 2019. then I felt kind of stuck
10:49 - talking about in 2020 then I felt stuck
10:50 - talking about it and everywhere I would
10:53 - look in every big
10:56 - um person I would look to you know
10:57 - whether it was Alex hermosi or any of
10:59 - these like big people again you might
11:00 - not know them if you're in the coding
11:02 - space but like these people in the
11:04 - marketing world right let's just say
11:06 - they were saying Focus one thing stick
11:09 - to one thing winners just stick to one
11:11 - thing over a long period of time and
11:12 - that's how they win and that's how life
11:13 - is supposed to be you just focus you cut
11:15 - everything else out and you just got to
11:17 - be disciplined and it's just you being
11:18 - distracted and broke people are
11:20 - distracted don't get distracted and so
11:22 - all those things built up and it's
11:24 - obviously fault of my own as well just
11:26 - built up a lot of pressure in my mind to
11:27 - be like you know what I have to just
11:29 - keep growing this thing this is the only
11:31 - thing I have to grow and so even I was
11:33 - disconnected I was like well I could
11:34 - still be disciplined and it's still
11:36 - valuable for people and it could still
11:37 - bring value to people and I still have a
11:40 - lot of knowledge to give so then I just
11:42 - stay diligent and focused and I'm like
11:43 - even if I don't enjoy it other people
11:46 - get value out of it so I just should
11:48 - keep doing it keep doing it keep doing
11:49 - it so I grind it all of 2019 and did
11:52 - that and then 2020 we built a big team
11:56 - and had crazy Revenue coming in every
11:58 - single month
12:00 - only to realize that we were losing
12:03 - money and bleeding money every single
12:04 - month
12:06 - um and then a bunch of team members left
12:07 - at the end of 2020 and that was pretty
12:09 - bad and kind of awful and then 2021 was
12:12 - similar experience it was just like
12:14 - we have to make like hundred thousand
12:17 - dollars a month or have to make like 150
12:20 - 000 a month like there's no other choice
12:22 - we have to do that but then the
12:24 - depressing part at the end of the month
12:25 - there was a month I think 2020 2021 I'm
12:29 - like losing track of some of the years
12:30 - but like there was there were there was
12:32 - months where
12:34 - keep in mind I'm this kid who came from
12:36 - Pakistan who like didn't really have
12:38 - anything growing up you know went to a
12:40 - religious school where they beat the
12:41 -  out of you like all this random
12:43 - stuff and I'm not saying I was like from
12:45 - a you know poor family but we were like
12:47 - middle class we were like low middle
12:49 - class and you know um my family was
12:52 - doing like slightly above minimum wage
12:54 - jobs and we were doing you know okay
12:58 - but to go from that to like you're
13:01 - growing a channel and you have all this
13:03 - all these subscribers that you have all
13:05 - this income coming in and you have all
13:07 - this all these students that you're
13:08 - taking care of
13:10 - I was like this is crazy and so we were
13:13 - hitting months that were like 200 250
13:16 - 000 in a month and I was like this is
13:18 - unreal
13:20 - but the crazy thing was the expenses
13:22 - that month were like 260 000. like
13:24 - imagine that just imagine that I mean
13:27 - it's crazy right to imagine I think it's
13:29 - even crazier for people to understand
13:30 - you can make more than like forty
13:32 - thousand dollars or like sixty thousand
13:34 - dollars in a year like that seems so
13:35 - crazy right so you're making 260 000 in
13:40 - a month
13:42 - but here's a pathetic part
13:44 - on 250 000 50 000 that you're making
13:47 - you're spending two hundred and sixty
13:49 - thousand or two hundred fifty five
13:50 - thousand and so I was actually more
13:53 - broke than
13:56 - a normal person like a normal person
13:58 - just doing a job at McDonald's was
14:00 - richer than I was
14:02 - and that was a very sad moment because
14:04 - there was so much Financial pressure
14:06 - that I was feeling in that time it was
14:08 - crushing me literally crushing my soul
14:11 - underneath
14:12 - and the financial pressure was like we
14:14 - gotta run all these ads because we have
14:16 - 25 people on the team and they feel like
14:18 - my friends and they feel like my family
14:19 - and I can't fire them so I have to just
14:21 - do things to make money I have to do it
14:24 - for them and I have to I have to have to
14:26 - have to
14:28 - and at some point it just got to a point
14:30 - where we couldn't keep it up anymore and
14:32 - I kind of was like Crush under got
14:34 - crushed under the pressure and then you
14:36 - know 2021 or something along those lines
14:38 - we had to just let go of everybody on
14:41 - the team and kind of start over from
14:43 - scratch and once I did that I started
14:45 - feeling peace again and kind of Joy
14:46 - again I started enjoying things
14:49 - but still the problem remained which was
14:51 - like I was just trying not to lose all
14:53 - the success I had built and I just kept
14:55 - sticking with the coding Channel and
14:56 - encoding content and
14:58 - and again it wasn't like my day-to-day
15:00 - passion anymore it was something I just
15:03 - did because I thought it brought value
15:04 - to other people
15:06 - and so that was 2021 2022 2023 and so
15:09 - imagine like
15:11 - you know spending one year of like real
15:14 - passion and six or seven years out of
15:16 - just sheer discipline and focus and
15:19 - consistency and and project management
15:21 - and like
15:23 - and that's how I got to a million
15:25 - subscribers
15:26 - and you know some of you look at my
15:29 - content you're like no
15:30 - I I don't know like you guys are really
15:32 - smart you probably can feel by my energy
15:35 - and you've seen videos really see really
15:37 - that into it I mean again when I'm doing
15:39 - the videos it's not like I'm faking it
15:40 - I'm enjoying the videos but over it's
15:43 - like I fit I would figure out how to
15:45 - kind of enjoy when I was in the middle
15:47 - of it you know but it wasn't something I
15:49 - obsessed about
15:50 - because I didn't do it on a regular
15:52 - basis to this day I still sit down
15:54 - sometimes and if I have an opportunity
15:56 - to code or build an app I'll have one of
15:58 - my developers on the team and I'll just
16:00 - sit down with them on a meeting and
16:01 - start building up with him and before I
16:03 - realized six hours have passed and so I
16:05 - enjoy that when I when I'm in that zone
16:07 - then I like talking about it but for the
16:09 - last six years I wasn't coding I had to
16:12 - like build the business and grow the
16:13 - channel and like everything that was
16:16 - coding
16:18 - and a lot of lessons I learned from that
16:20 - and it's like
16:25 - if I was making like like who was I
16:27 - making 250 000 a month for if I was
16:30 - losing 250 000 like my income is zero
16:33 - right I'm broke the income is zero
16:36 - yes there were years where we had like
16:38 - profit and stuff but I I would reinvest
16:40 - aggressively but like you know and I
16:43 - always laughed and I would say like it's
16:45 - interesting how many ways there are to
16:46 - make zero dollars
16:48 - and so at the end of the day there's no
16:51 - income coming in and I'm still somebody
16:53 - who has like you're making zero dollars
16:55 - so why not
16:57 - like you could if you you could make 250
17:00 - 000 and then make zero dollars and have
17:01 - all that crazy stress that comes with
17:04 - having to make that money
17:07 - and managing a team and AD spend and all
17:09 - this stuff
17:11 - or
17:13 - you could just be at zero dollars like
17:17 - AKA just have no expenses and also be
17:19 - making no money like it's the same thing
17:21 - but one of them is a lot less stressful
17:23 - right and so then I'm like why am I
17:25 - doing this like going at such a crazy
17:27 - pace
17:28 - and so those were a couple of big
17:30 - realizations that I've had over the last
17:32 - few years and then now what it has come
17:34 - to essentially is like
17:36 - what I've been really excited to do is
17:38 - show people how to grow their YouTube
17:40 - channels what I've been really excited
17:42 - to do is even more than that honestly is
17:45 - I want to make content that challenges
17:48 - me because for me it's boring to keep
17:51 - making the same content again and again
17:54 - top five programming languages top five
17:56 - highest paying programming jobs three
17:57 - tips developers didn't know
18:00 - Tick Tock app but let's build LinkedIn
18:03 - let's build this and let's build this
18:05 - and let's build this it's like
18:07 - it just doesn't fulfill me right it's
18:10 - like boring it's easy and you felt that
18:12 - way right in life where you figure out
18:14 - something and then at some point it
18:15 - feels boring and you kind of want a new
18:17 - challenge and that's why
18:18 - we like even coding because there's
18:21 - always a new problem to solve and so it
18:22 - was killing me to have just the same
18:24 - problem trying to just
18:26 - okay we got to keep solving this problem
18:28 - over and over again and so the direction
18:30 - I'm heading in is
18:32 - one where now thank God I'm not in a in
18:35 - a position I've gotten myself out of a
18:37 - position where
18:39 - um I don't need
18:40 - um I I like I've gotten myself out of a
18:42 - position where I don't need literally
18:44 - any of the viewers money I don't need
18:46 - any customers money I don't need YouTube
18:48 - ads uh spent to give me money
18:51 - um I don't need sponsorship money like
18:53 - none of those things are necessary and
18:55 - so now I'm like what do I actually want
18:58 - to do
18:59 - and what comes to me is I want to pursue
19:02 - creatively challenging
19:05 - things that interest me that are hard
19:07 - that are exciting you know and so
19:11 - um
19:12 - you know like ran like for example Joma
19:15 - Tech is a great example
19:17 - how he just went the route of like
19:18 - chasing his Creative Vision you know and
19:22 - I'll give you a simple example of my
19:24 - like
19:25 - I love that type of stuff love that type
19:27 - of crazy content and um recently I made
19:30 - a video on Clever programmer and if you
19:33 - look that's the last video that I made
19:35 - with all my a heart and effort
19:37 - and um it's the chat GPT one and I even
19:40 - edited it
19:42 - in in on my channel it crushed it
19:44 - because on the clever programmer Channel
19:46 - I don't really get that many views I
19:47 - actually get very little views
19:50 - um per video like 10 day 10K views or 8K
19:52 - views and that video I was on um Chad
19:55 - GPT built my app in minutes and that
19:57 - video in one month got like 600 000
19:59 - views and if you watch that video you
20:01 - can see that I'm enjoying myself making
20:04 - that video I'm enjoying the art behind
20:08 - it I'm enjoying the storytelling behind
20:10 - it and if you watch that video you'll
20:12 - enjoy it and it's funny and it's kind of
20:14 - crazy and it's wild and so like that to
20:16 - me is creatively challenging and
20:18 - fulfilling and so if there happens to be
20:20 - some kind of creative challenge
20:21 - something that's fulfilling in the
20:23 - coding World I'll make a video you know
20:25 - on this channel
20:26 - but
20:28 - I I my gut feeling is you're not gonna
20:30 - see a lot of content for me on this
20:32 - channel for now like there might be some
20:34 - random stuff I want to share like this
20:36 - and I might drop it
20:37 - but um
20:40 - mostly I want to be making videos on my
20:43 - personal brand rafikaze that's the one I
20:45 - want to grow and I have lots of crazy
20:46 - ideas that I want to pursue and so some
20:49 - content I want to make on chess because
20:51 - I love chess and so I've been making
20:53 - content on that there's going to be some
20:54 - other content that's going to be like
20:57 - really crazy
20:59 - um like so think like some some kind of
21:01 - crazy challenge or something people are
21:03 - really curious about you know and um
21:07 - I don't assure that that much yet
21:10 - because sometimes when I share I get the
21:12 - high of just sharing it and then I end
21:14 - up not doing it so I'll keep it to
21:16 - myself for now and then once it's real
21:17 - you'll see it live on my personal brand
21:19 - Channel like rafikaze and so that's
21:22 - what's that's what's exciting me so I
21:23 - want to pursue that and then I want to
21:26 - you know if there's something that
21:27 - excites me in the coding world to talk
21:28 - about I'll talk about it from time to
21:30 - time or sometimes I want to share with
21:32 - you or if you guys like this video then
21:33 - maybe I'll make more like these because
21:35 - I'm just like what would I do if like
21:37 - literally I didn't care about like
21:39 - having to support a team or a payroll or
21:42 - any of that and you just focus and even
21:44 - now we have a now we have a very lean
21:46 - team
21:49 - um
21:50 - yeah so and and I spent all day today
21:52 - cutting like software expenses because
21:54 - I'm like
21:55 - what I need to do over the last next 10
21:58 - years is put myself in a position where
22:00 - I can maximize how many risks I can take
22:02 - because the more risks I can take the
22:04 - more chances I get at one just
22:07 - fulfilling my own self and having less
22:09 - regret in life two I maximize my flow
22:11 - state
22:13 - um
22:15 - and and obviously my growth
22:17 - and so I want to
22:20 - do things that maximize my growth right
22:23 - which is taking risk so how do I put
22:25 - myself in this position to take those
22:27 - risks well how I do that is by
22:31 - not having ridiculous overhead not
22:33 - having a ridiculously large
22:36 - Titanic sized team to support because
22:39 - then it goes from
22:40 - what's the thing that I want to do that
22:42 - fulfills me that can also bring value to
22:45 - everybody else like you
22:48 - it goes from that to how do I get this
22:51 - team member paid next month because if I
22:53 - don't do this you know like if I don't
22:56 - make money and I'm Not The Rainmaker
22:58 - that they think I am
23:00 - they don't get paid they don't get to
23:02 - put food on the table right and it's not
23:04 - that dramatic because people are very
23:06 - resourceful right and so it's like if
23:07 - you can't make it they'll get a job and
23:09 - everybody on my team is so talented that
23:11 - like if they bounce they'll have a job
23:13 - Max in one week like everybody is a
23:15 - killer like if they weren't before they
23:16 - are now everybody's super talented on
23:18 - the team now
23:19 - um
23:20 - and so
23:22 - yeah it's like I
23:25 - it's like now that I don't have that
23:27 - pressure I want to pursue the things
23:29 - that I want to pursue and enjoy and you
23:31 - know if I could go back and this is
23:33 - where I think it could be valuable for
23:34 - you but it's like if I could go back man
23:36 - I would just focus on
23:38 - what's like I would really make the
23:40 - foundation with something I enjoy like I
23:43 - would really really really really really
23:45 - make that the foundation and not go from
23:48 - like this Duty passion like this
23:52 - discipline like there's nothing wrong
23:53 - with discipline but it's like what do
23:55 - you throw a discipline at right they
23:56 - find through discipline at the thing
23:58 - that fed me and made me really excited I
24:01 - would have been like 10 times a bigger
24:03 - Channel without even needing all that
24:04 - team because honestly the one of the
24:06 - reasons I needed such a massive team is
24:08 - because I didn't want to do any of those
24:10 - things that I was doing like they were
24:11 - not fun they were boring as to me
24:14 - and so I was like that's why I had a big
24:16 - team that was the reason I was just
24:17 - paying everybody to like hey you do all
24:19 - the stuff that like I really don't want
24:21 - to do and now that it's like I'm doing
24:24 - all of the things that I really want to
24:25 - be doing I'm like not like no I want to
24:28 - edit like I want less editors I want to
24:30 - edit
24:32 - and so my message to you is just
24:35 - can you make your joy the foundation
24:39 - make that the foundation and then build
24:41 - discipline on top of that and then build
24:43 - other things on top of that you know
24:44 - because the last thing I want you to do
24:45 - is like spend six years trying to become
24:48 - a coder when you really just didn't like
24:51 - it and you only were doing it because
24:52 - you're trying to impress your friend or
24:54 - you're trying to show your dad they're
24:56 - smart enough to be able to do that but
24:58 - like you don't actually like it you
25:00 - don't actually enjoy it you know what I
25:01 - mean
25:03 - um
25:10 - yeah
25:11 - so I would I would say
25:12 - [Music]
25:15 - spend time thinking about that so spend
25:18 - um
25:19 - spend time thinking about what you want
25:21 - to truly do
25:23 - and then build on top of that you know I
25:26 - think that's going to be a beautiful
25:27 - thing like you can't see it but I have
25:29 - my 1 million Subs plaque like that's
25:32 - pretty cool but
25:34 - I kind of
25:36 - I don't want to kind of built the wrong
25:37 - thing because that's a pretty bold
25:39 - statement but
25:40 - I kind of built the thing that I wasn't
25:42 - that passionate about
25:43 - you know I'm okayly passionate about it
25:46 - like I can enjoy it certainly but
25:50 - is it's not something that I was doing
25:52 - on a regular basis and I'd rather build
25:54 - a brand and a channel on things that I'm
25:56 - doing on a regular basis like I just did
25:58 - 100 day Muay Thai Challenge and so like
25:59 - I'd rather make content on that right
26:01 - like because that's top of my mind it's
26:03 - exciting to me just did a hundred days
26:05 - spent 100 days and um so I did 100 days
26:08 - of Muay Thai and I ended up doing a Muay
26:10 - Thai fight at the end of the hundred
26:11 - days so that's exciting to talk about I
26:13 - did a hundred day I went from couch
26:15 - potatoes
26:16 - to running a marathon in 100 days like
26:18 - that was exciting so I would want to
26:20 - talk about that
26:22 - and that's something I have the freedom
26:24 - to talk more about on my personal brand
26:26 - and now that I have a smaller team and
26:29 - lower expenses
26:30 - I don't need every single video to bang
26:33 - it crazy amount of viewership so that
26:36 - could get crazy amount of money or
26:39 - whatever like
26:40 - I can I can make content that I want to
26:43 - make even if it gets like 2 000 views
26:45 - like this video like it's probably gonna
26:47 - get like
26:48 - 1300 views you know because I'm not
26:51 - talking about coding and I'm talking I'm
26:52 - putting it on my coding Channel but I
26:54 - just don't care because if
26:57 - one it makes me feel good just to talk
26:59 - about this
27:01 - and two
27:03 - because I think I just want one person
27:06 - to listen to it and get value out of it
27:08 - like a person who is maybe gonna create
27:10 - content or is a content creator and
27:12 - might not ever comment on it but watches
27:15 - it and is like holy like I was
27:18 - going down that path and it helped me
27:20 - change and I'm not going to pursue that
27:21 - path and I'm gonna go into like what
27:23 - makes me excited and passionate
27:25 - and um
27:28 - yeah and then for somebody who's
27:30 - becoming a developer but they realize
27:32 - like that's not their thing you know
27:34 - they don't really enjoy it they're doing
27:35 - it for lots of other reasons like don't
27:37 - do it if you don't enjoy it only do it
27:39 - if you enjoy it like your joy of it
27:41 - should be the foundation
27:44 - that's my message to you I love you well
27:46 - I'll see you bye

Cleaned transcript:

it's about time I thought I would make this video and just talk about a couple of things that have been on my mind for a minute okay so this is not like an April Fool's joke or anything that I did a while ago where I said I'm quitting YouTube and it was just an April Fool's joke but what I am quitting is I'm quitting being on the content treadmill that I got on with YouTube I realized a lot of things about life and I had lots of learning lessons over the last few years as I was growing clever programmer and I'll also kind of share what I see as the future and what I'll be doing on Clever programmer and what I will be doing in general uh probably outside of clever programmer and this video is for a lot of people like it's not just for developers I want to make this video for even other content creators if you're a YouTuber and you're a content creator and you're maybe a developer who's creating content on other channels or thinking about creating content I think this could be something useful for you and valuable for you to know I'm gonna be a little bit all over the place I'm sorry but I'll just stick to like what I want to say whatever's coming to my mind and uh and I and I hope it'll make sense but a few years ago I mean lots of years ago right when I started my coding Channel about six or seven years ago I was really excited about it really passionate about coding because I was coding every single day and um I was coding about 14 15 hours a day and always had these crazy epiphanies and discoveries that I wanted to share like when I was a beginner I was like oh my God I just wanted Fibonacci Sequence I have to share with somebody when I learned the recurse recursion and I remember being at McDonald's with uh uh like my exgirlfriend a long time ago and like literally stopping at McDonald's and going like and she was like annoyed by it you know because I would talk so much about coding all the time and I like stopped her and I sat her down at McDonald's and we got fries and I was like 19 or 20 or something like that at that time and I was like I just learned recursion it's crazy I have to show you and I sat her down and like opened up my napkin and then I like Drew out recursion I showed her like how it worked and it was so epic I was having so much fun I think she wasn't having that much fun and I broke it down exactly how it worked how I thought it worked because it just clicked in my head and I was like it's crazy just like how it unfolds all the way down until the base case and then it goes the other way oh it's beautiful it's amazing all right so one of the coolest things on planet Earth I want to like kind of figured it out and and I was a lot slower than everybody and I was dumber than everybody and so like you know other my friends would understand it and like after one's class session they've been like oh yes recursion it makes so much sense and for me it didn't make any sense it was something like that I had to spend like eight hours you know for so many days in a row and then two weeks three weeks later it finally clicked it I was like oh my gosh awesome I was sharing it with her and I was so fascinated I was blown away but I remember it was so I was so excited about that time right and I think that was the time I I wanted to share all these things and so what I did is I created a channel and that was brilliant timing for that channel because right when I was passionate about it I started creating content and so then every day I would share something that I was excited about so whether it was like an R programming language video I made a long time ago or I started teaching python because I was learning Python and then right when I got a job I started showing people how to get a job and it was it was all very passionate and real and very exciting then that was like 2016 27 some of it was 2017 then 2017 things changed because 2016 I was like a student and living this normal life and then at the end of 2016 my channel started taking off and I was starting to get like people following me and all that stuff and around the end of 2016 start of 2017 I had a bunch of people hitting me up like hey let me do your marketing and work on your marketing funnels and let's launch a product and you should launch a course and this is how you make money and you should do this type of business model and I was also pretty interested in you know I was looking to zero to launch by ramit seti and all this stuff and I was excited and I know if you're on this developer Channel you're gonna be like what the hell are any of these things like I just want a code that's fine if you want to do that just go away from this video because like there's probably not going to be anything of interest to you because I'm not really going to be talking about coding that much in this video but I hope that some of it could still resonate with you because our passions change and I kind of want to talk about that and so that was a lot of fun for me that was that was a lot of fun because I would learn the stuff and share it and then implement it and then I got into like learning business because I was growing the YouTube channel and I was growing a coursebased business online digital course business I was like this is exciting so I was learning about email lists and email marketing and content and content strategies and um how do you do a product launch successfully and how do you build a hype for it how do you deliver the product and how do you presell a product and how do you fulfill customers and how do you upsell and how do you have customer retention so customers actually stick through and enjoy the product and the services you provide how do you lower the refund I mean everything business related and along with that came other things like managing a team um hiring an assistant hiring an editor then we need to scale so like getting more creative creators and then more and more and more and more and until I realized that it was just this constant thing of I have to do more I have to skill more I have to make more money the next month than the previous month because I have a payroll to pay now and I have to I have to I have to I have to and from back when like things were because I got to do them and because I wanted to do them and me going to Dunkin Donuts to solve a coding problem because I was trying to solve like the literal schemer book from like 6 p.m to 5am I was doing that you know I was like all because I wanted to do it and then at this point I didn't really want to do that stuff anymore and um everything was just a burden and so around like 2017 if you watch some of my videos like earlier kind of in 2017 like or mid 2017 I started to like kind of look depressed or sad or low energy because I was like I'm just being I feel so forced to be doing these things so that was great and then happened and then I ended up launching a course at the end of 2017 profitable programmer and that launch went great and we had a ton of students enroll and I decided to leave Chicago at that time and go to LA and then after that it was just like go go fast like be in a fast place like la get a bunch of creators you know be around bunch of creators hire a bigger team like par um you know and then because I got kind of new into like money and status and fame and all of those things were very new to me I didn't know what to do with them so 2018 I was like partying and spending a lot of time dating and just doing a bunch of random that wasn't actually productive for my business or my health and um yeah I just had to prove people wrong and I'd show people what I could do and I got to show people what who I could be and and it wasn't the right way to spend a year but that's how 2018 went and you could see my content is like very little content that I did um and then as 2019 was like crazy 2019 started kind of crazy at a breaking point because at the end of 2018 I kind of got depressed and it was I was really sad I lost my entire team everybody was like pretty much like you know what you everybody left the team and quit and so that 2019 I had to build all over again from scratch and then grow and so that made me realize okay I have to live a life of more purpose I have to do things that are aligned and I have to focus on discipline and building consistency and showing up for my team and being somebody who's reliable being somebody who people could count on and so then that became my focus starting in 2019. and I got some of the team members back whose trust I had lost I had I showed my character over time and discipline and I started getting more consistent again with content and here here's where things started to go started to change because see 2016 it was all about like coding and that was my passion 2017 it was about like proving these business Concepts right and kind of make them work and 2018 was like partying and discovering myself and seeing who I am and just a bunch of different stuff right like really going to the extreme and then 2019 I went back into being disciplined back into being all of that but at that point what happened was I was doing all those things it was discipline and I was being consistent I started this 30day challenge where I wouldn't miss a single video every single day I would drop a video and start building the audience back up again and started dropping Banger content I dropped a Python tutorial and like boom things were blowing up in 2019 again but see the interesting thing is I wasn't really passionate about coding anymore like truly truly truly passionate about coding anymore and it was a really scary thing because I'm like well I've been spending so much time building up this channel I can't quit now and everybody around me was just like your 100 000 subscribers 200 000 subscribers like are you stupid you can't change now you can go do other things like you have to just keep going and keep going and I'm like but I'm not really feeling it that much anymore you know it's not something that drives me or excites me that much like I like coding but I don't get to do it my whole time is spent managing a team building a team um customers and meetings and all this other stuff and so I'm focused on selfdevelopment and business and Leadership and all this other stuff and like I'm excited to talk about it but now I don't have a platform to talk about it I have a platform to talk about what I wanted to talk about two years ago and then I was just stuck talking about it in 2019. then I felt kind of stuck talking about in 2020 then I felt stuck talking about it and everywhere I would look in every big um person I would look to you know whether it was Alex hermosi or any of these like big people again you might not know them if you're in the coding space but like these people in the marketing world right let's just say they were saying Focus one thing stick to one thing winners just stick to one thing over a long period of time and that's how they win and that's how life is supposed to be you just focus you cut everything else out and you just got to be disciplined and it's just you being distracted and broke people are distracted don't get distracted and so all those things built up and it's obviously fault of my own as well just built up a lot of pressure in my mind to be like you know what I have to just keep growing this thing this is the only thing I have to grow and so even I was disconnected I was like well I could still be disciplined and it's still valuable for people and it could still bring value to people and I still have a lot of knowledge to give so then I just stay diligent and focused and I'm like even if I don't enjoy it other people get value out of it so I just should keep doing it keep doing it keep doing it so I grind it all of 2019 and did that and then 2020 we built a big team and had crazy Revenue coming in every single month only to realize that we were losing money and bleeding money every single month um and then a bunch of team members left at the end of 2020 and that was pretty bad and kind of awful and then 2021 was similar experience it was just like we have to make like hundred thousand dollars a month or have to make like 150 000 a month like there's no other choice we have to do that but then the depressing part at the end of the month there was a month I think 2020 2021 I'm like losing track of some of the years but like there was there were there was months where keep in mind I'm this kid who came from Pakistan who like didn't really have anything growing up you know went to a religious school where they beat the out of you like all this random stuff and I'm not saying I was like from a you know poor family but we were like middle class we were like low middle class and you know um my family was doing like slightly above minimum wage jobs and we were doing you know okay but to go from that to like you're growing a channel and you have all this all these subscribers that you have all this income coming in and you have all this all these students that you're taking care of I was like this is crazy and so we were hitting months that were like 200 250 000 in a month and I was like this is unreal but the crazy thing was the expenses that month were like 260 000. like imagine that just imagine that I mean it's crazy right to imagine I think it's even crazier for people to understand you can make more than like forty thousand dollars or like sixty thousand dollars in a year like that seems so crazy right so you're making 260 000 in a month but here's a pathetic part on 250 000 50 000 that you're making you're spending two hundred and sixty thousand or two hundred fifty five thousand and so I was actually more broke than a normal person like a normal person just doing a job at McDonald's was richer than I was and that was a very sad moment because there was so much Financial pressure that I was feeling in that time it was crushing me literally crushing my soul underneath and the financial pressure was like we gotta run all these ads because we have 25 people on the team and they feel like my friends and they feel like my family and I can't fire them so I have to just do things to make money I have to do it for them and I have to I have to have to have to and at some point it just got to a point where we couldn't keep it up anymore and I kind of was like Crush under got crushed under the pressure and then you know 2021 or something along those lines we had to just let go of everybody on the team and kind of start over from scratch and once I did that I started feeling peace again and kind of Joy again I started enjoying things but still the problem remained which was like I was just trying not to lose all the success I had built and I just kept sticking with the coding Channel and encoding content and and again it wasn't like my daytoday passion anymore it was something I just did because I thought it brought value to other people and so that was 2021 2022 2023 and so imagine like you know spending one year of like real passion and six or seven years out of just sheer discipline and focus and consistency and and project management and like and that's how I got to a million subscribers and you know some of you look at my content you're like no I I don't know like you guys are really smart you probably can feel by my energy and you've seen videos really see really that into it I mean again when I'm doing the videos it's not like I'm faking it I'm enjoying the videos but over it's like I fit I would figure out how to kind of enjoy when I was in the middle of it you know but it wasn't something I obsessed about because I didn't do it on a regular basis to this day I still sit down sometimes and if I have an opportunity to code or build an app I'll have one of my developers on the team and I'll just sit down with them on a meeting and start building up with him and before I realized six hours have passed and so I enjoy that when I when I'm in that zone then I like talking about it but for the last six years I wasn't coding I had to like build the business and grow the channel and like everything that was coding and a lot of lessons I learned from that and it's like if I was making like like who was I making 250 000 a month for if I was losing 250 000 like my income is zero right I'm broke the income is zero yes there were years where we had like profit and stuff but I I would reinvest aggressively but like you know and I always laughed and I would say like it's interesting how many ways there are to make zero dollars and so at the end of the day there's no income coming in and I'm still somebody who has like you're making zero dollars so why not like you could if you you could make 250 000 and then make zero dollars and have all that crazy stress that comes with having to make that money and managing a team and AD spend and all this stuff or you could just be at zero dollars like AKA just have no expenses and also be making no money like it's the same thing but one of them is a lot less stressful right and so then I'm like why am I doing this like going at such a crazy pace and so those were a couple of big realizations that I've had over the last few years and then now what it has come to essentially is like what I've been really excited to do is show people how to grow their YouTube channels what I've been really excited to do is even more than that honestly is I want to make content that challenges me because for me it's boring to keep making the same content again and again top five programming languages top five highest paying programming jobs three tips developers didn't know Tick Tock app but let's build LinkedIn let's build this and let's build this and let's build this it's like it just doesn't fulfill me right it's like boring it's easy and you felt that way right in life where you figure out something and then at some point it feels boring and you kind of want a new challenge and that's why we like even coding because there's always a new problem to solve and so it was killing me to have just the same problem trying to just okay we got to keep solving this problem over and over again and so the direction I'm heading in is one where now thank God I'm not in a in a position I've gotten myself out of a position where um I don't need um I I like I've gotten myself out of a position where I don't need literally any of the viewers money I don't need any customers money I don't need YouTube ads uh spent to give me money um I don't need sponsorship money like none of those things are necessary and so now I'm like what do I actually want to do and what comes to me is I want to pursue creatively challenging things that interest me that are hard that are exciting you know and so um you know like ran like for example Joma Tech is a great example how he just went the route of like chasing his Creative Vision you know and I'll give you a simple example of my like I love that type of stuff love that type of crazy content and um recently I made a video on Clever programmer and if you look that's the last video that I made with all my a heart and effort and um it's the chat GPT one and I even edited it in in on my channel it crushed it because on the clever programmer Channel I don't really get that many views I actually get very little views um per video like 10 day 10K views or 8K views and that video I was on um Chad GPT built my app in minutes and that video in one month got like 600 000 views and if you watch that video you can see that I'm enjoying myself making that video I'm enjoying the art behind it I'm enjoying the storytelling behind it and if you watch that video you'll enjoy it and it's funny and it's kind of crazy and it's wild and so like that to me is creatively challenging and fulfilling and so if there happens to be some kind of creative challenge something that's fulfilling in the coding World I'll make a video you know on this channel but I I my gut feeling is you're not gonna see a lot of content for me on this channel for now like there might be some random stuff I want to share like this and I might drop it but um mostly I want to be making videos on my personal brand rafikaze that's the one I want to grow and I have lots of crazy ideas that I want to pursue and so some content I want to make on chess because I love chess and so I've been making content on that there's going to be some other content that's going to be like really crazy um like so think like some some kind of crazy challenge or something people are really curious about you know and um I don't assure that that much yet because sometimes when I share I get the high of just sharing it and then I end up not doing it so I'll keep it to myself for now and then once it's real you'll see it live on my personal brand Channel like rafikaze and so that's what's that's what's exciting me so I want to pursue that and then I want to you know if there's something that excites me in the coding world to talk about I'll talk about it from time to time or sometimes I want to share with you or if you guys like this video then maybe I'll make more like these because I'm just like what would I do if like literally I didn't care about like having to support a team or a payroll or any of that and you just focus and even now we have a now we have a very lean team um yeah so and and I spent all day today cutting like software expenses because I'm like what I need to do over the last next 10 years is put myself in a position where I can maximize how many risks I can take because the more risks I can take the more chances I get at one just fulfilling my own self and having less regret in life two I maximize my flow state um and and obviously my growth and so I want to do things that maximize my growth right which is taking risk so how do I put myself in this position to take those risks well how I do that is by not having ridiculous overhead not having a ridiculously large Titanic sized team to support because then it goes from what's the thing that I want to do that fulfills me that can also bring value to everybody else like you it goes from that to how do I get this team member paid next month because if I don't do this you know like if I don't make money and I'm Not The Rainmaker that they think I am they don't get paid they don't get to put food on the table right and it's not that dramatic because people are very resourceful right and so it's like if you can't make it they'll get a job and everybody on my team is so talented that like if they bounce they'll have a job Max in one week like everybody is a killer like if they weren't before they are now everybody's super talented on the team now um and so yeah it's like I it's like now that I don't have that pressure I want to pursue the things that I want to pursue and enjoy and you know if I could go back and this is where I think it could be valuable for you but it's like if I could go back man I would just focus on what's like I would really make the foundation with something I enjoy like I would really really really really really make that the foundation and not go from like this Duty passion like this discipline like there's nothing wrong with discipline but it's like what do you throw a discipline at right they find through discipline at the thing that fed me and made me really excited I would have been like 10 times a bigger Channel without even needing all that team because honestly the one of the reasons I needed such a massive team is because I didn't want to do any of those things that I was doing like they were not fun they were boring as to me and so I was like that's why I had a big team that was the reason I was just paying everybody to like hey you do all the stuff that like I really don't want to do and now that it's like I'm doing all of the things that I really want to be doing I'm like not like no I want to edit like I want less editors I want to edit and so my message to you is just can you make your joy the foundation make that the foundation and then build discipline on top of that and then build other things on top of that you know because the last thing I want you to do is like spend six years trying to become a coder when you really just didn't like it and you only were doing it because you're trying to impress your friend or you're trying to show your dad they're smart enough to be able to do that but like you don't actually like it you don't actually enjoy it you know what I mean um yeah so I would I would say spend time thinking about that so spend um spend time thinking about what you want to truly do and then build on top of that you know I think that's going to be a beautiful thing like you can't see it but I have my 1 million Subs plaque like that's pretty cool but I kind of I don't want to kind of built the wrong thing because that's a pretty bold statement but I kind of built the thing that I wasn't that passionate about you know I'm okayly passionate about it like I can enjoy it certainly but is it's not something that I was doing on a regular basis and I'd rather build a brand and a channel on things that I'm doing on a regular basis like I just did 100 day Muay Thai Challenge and so like I'd rather make content on that right like because that's top of my mind it's exciting to me just did a hundred days spent 100 days and um so I did 100 days of Muay Thai and I ended up doing a Muay Thai fight at the end of the hundred days so that's exciting to talk about I did a hundred day I went from couch potatoes to running a marathon in 100 days like that was exciting so I would want to talk about that and that's something I have the freedom to talk more about on my personal brand and now that I have a smaller team and lower expenses I don't need every single video to bang it crazy amount of viewership so that could get crazy amount of money or whatever like I can I can make content that I want to make even if it gets like 2 000 views like this video like it's probably gonna get like 1300 views you know because I'm not talking about coding and I'm talking I'm putting it on my coding Channel but I just don't care because if one it makes me feel good just to talk about this and two because I think I just want one person to listen to it and get value out of it like a person who is maybe gonna create content or is a content creator and might not ever comment on it but watches it and is like holy like I was going down that path and it helped me change and I'm not going to pursue that path and I'm gonna go into like what makes me excited and passionate and um yeah and then for somebody who's becoming a developer but they realize like that's not their thing you know they don't really enjoy it they're doing it for lots of other reasons like don't do it if you don't enjoy it only do it if you enjoy it like your joy of it should be the foundation that's my message to you I love you well I'll see you bye
