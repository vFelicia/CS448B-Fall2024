13:49 - use technologies
13:50 - do we have to know just somewhere there
13:51 - no look at this in this clock we'll get
13:53 - new technologies like crazy look at this
13:55 - let me check this out for you so you
13:56 - have it here guys and kind of screenshot
13:58 - this guys for yourself okay
14:00 - so we get to use stuff like for example
14:02 - i mean of course react.js you guys know
14:04 - this at this point right
14:05 - we get to use for example style
14:06 - components which is insane
14:08 - style components right we'll get to use
14:11 - things like for example
14:13 - uh firebase right for data right
14:16 - and the cool thing this is again this is
14:17 - for data purposes let me go ahead and

14:20 - going to save data right so if i go
14:22 - ahead for example
14:23 - if i point to it for you let me go and
14:25 - point it
14:26 - this data data is what kind of shows up
14:28 - this right here you see how says

14:44 - right here eric gs in general that's the
14:45 - whole application okay
14:47 - on top of that we'll use you get to
14:50 - learn stuff like okay
14:51 - what are for example like components
14:54 - right so components is kind of the
14:55 - building blocks
14:56 - of react.js in general you'll get to
14:58 - learn things for example how to
15:00 - how to go ahead and well i mean we talk
15:02 - about style style style components
15:04 - but how to com how to actually build
15:08 - a live live chat app right
15:11 - because this stuff right here like yes
15:14 - it's cool but
15:15 - this stuff right here let me show you
15:17 - this stuff
15:18 - is actually live so for example you know
15:20 - when you go to whatsapp
15:21 - when you go to whatsapp or maybe
15:23 - messages and you know you're texting
15:25 - someone
15:25 - and it kind of shows up live kind of as

28:41 - training yes okay but for now let's
28:43 - figure out your opportunities to become

28:46 - in 2021 there's actually well that this
28:49 - is actually going to be day five guys
28:50 - this day day five there shouldn't be day
28:52 - three that should be day five right here
28:53 - don't worry so on the last day we'll
28:55 - talk about
28:56 - the opportunity like the road map how
28:58 - the roadmap how to become
29:00 - you know how to make a hundred key per
29:01 - year so the more but that's gonna be day
29:02 - five guys
29:03 - but for now it's gonna figure out your
29:04 - opportunities to become a developer and
29:06 - why you're even here and why you should
29:08 - just learn react just in general okay
29:10 - so to get started it all starts with
29:13 - habits so what are some habits they need
29:14 - to learn daniel tell me
29:16 - well they're right in front of us but
29:17 - one of them is you want to make sure
29:19 - you're doing this because you love it
29:21 - you're having fun and it's enjoyable for
29:23 - you because the one thing you want to
29:24 - make sure you don't do programming for
29:26 - is learning how to become a developer is
29:28 - for the
29:29 - money money yes money is good as
29:33 - developer yes
29:34 - but it's not what's going to take you to
29:35 - the next level you have to be able to
29:37 - enjoy what you do guys that's the most
29:39 - important part
29:40 - it can be the first initiative because
29:41 - maybe like you're stuck in the career
29:42 - you don't want to do
29:43 - but you really need to enjoy something
29:45 - like coding because it's just not easy
29:48 - coding is just not easy in general it's
29:49 - hard right it's not easy
29:51 - it's going to take a lot of hard work a
29:52 - lot of patience and so what else do you
29:53 - think they need
29:55 - well you just said them they should
29:56 - develop a habit of hard work and
29:58 - have patience as well right yeah there
30:00 - you go patience what else should they
30:02 - develop
30:02 - you need to learn how to cooperate with
30:05 - other people
30:06 - and a team so that both of you guys or
30:08 - the whole team has not said can move a
30:10 - mountain and not just the hill
30:11 - yes i can this is a very important part
30:13 - this is what something a lot of people
30:14 - miss
30:15 - and we'll talk a little bit about that
30:16 - on day five as well right how do you
30:18 - cooperate more with the team because
30:20 - like we even spoke with a google
30:22 - recruiter and they said that team
30:23 - corporation and
30:24 - you know your eq is one of the biggest
30:26 - things they look for when they when they
30:27 - go and hire someone
30:29 - so like that to me is like really
30:30 - interesting right because if you can
30:32 - work the team nobody wants to work with
30:33 - an no matter what job
30:35 - you're at uh if he was an i
30:37 - would not want to work with him
30:38 - right like you know just that's just the
30:40 - case can you make that focus please can
30:42 - you press the button this one yeah press
30:43 - the button thank you so much
30:45 - okay awesome cool guys so you see that's
30:47 - the goal communication very important
30:48 - guys communicate what you're doing right
30:50 - learning always be learning as developer
30:52 - you always have to start staying on top
30:53 - of the things
30:54 - you know learning new technologies and

32:57 - fine if you're passionate about it if
32:58 - you're enjoying what you're doing
32:59 - i think that's a life worth living
33:02 - because you're actually living
33:03 - it's not like for us for example here
33:05 - guys like the reason why we can do so
33:06 - many calls like some of the live calls

33:20 - do you want to make
33:21 - per month as a react just drop in the
33:24 - comments below you're thinking about
33:26 - 50k but also be reasonable don't say
33:27 - like a thousand million hundred
33:29 - thousand million one trillion
33:31 - dollars 500 million dollars
33:33 - no please be reasonable okay and this
33:35 - question is important guys because
33:38 - again as it is very realistic you now
33:41 - know what you can start to work with
33:42 - once you set that goal
33:44 - you can reverse engineer that goal and
33:46 - figure out the action steps that you
33:48 - have to set
33:49 - to be able to hit that goal so comment
33:51 - down below your specific goal
33:52 - and what that looks like for you exactly
33:54 - and let's go ahead guys and also at the
33:56 - same time while you're doing that make
33:57 - sure to hit the like button right now
33:59 - hit the like button right now help us
34:01 - with this youtube algorithm because
34:03 - youtube algorithm sometimes can be a
34:04 - little bit of a little bit of hassle
34:06 - no we have to defeat the youtube
34:08 - algorithm because we cannot let it beat
34:10 - us
34:10 - no let's not beat those dudes guys our
34:12 - goal in this youtube live call and
34:14 - facebook live call
34:16 - is to get two 1k likes
34:20 - so let's go ahead and get to that as
34:22 - soon as possible because then you know
34:23 - what and then just keep
34:24 - somebody said one billion dollars holy
34:26 -  come on guys
34:29 - i'm saying 20k dollars that's that 20k
34:31 - above 70k that's that's pretty doable i
34:32 - would say so yeah 150k that's pretty
34:34 - good
34:35 - copy right here as well 7k you guys can
34:38 - even do more than 7k i would say so as
34:39 - well i think that might be the per month
34:41 - yeah yeah yeah so 7k per month 100k
34:43 - that's pretty good too
34:45 - 100k is good so yeah some great numbers
34:48 - i like that okay
34:49 - now do you want to freelance or full
34:51 - time okay let's think about this
34:52 - right so as a freelancer right what are
34:55 - some benefits you get as a freelancer
34:57 - think about this what do you think
34:58 - daniel well one of the first ones i
35:00 - thought was remote work but
35:02 - sometimes that is applicable to
35:03 - full-time as well but i think that's
35:04 - still something that people like right
35:06 - yeah remote work and you can maybe work
35:08 - around on your own schedule promote
35:10 - work from anywhere anywhere so you want
35:11 - to look at bali you can work on bali
35:13 - right oh
35:14 - man but especially right now during
35:16 - colby guys you have the opportunity to
35:18 - work remotely even if you have a
35:20 - full-time job as well
35:21 - so don't just limit yourself to
35:22 - freelance you can do both if you wanted
35:24 - to or you can try one and try another
35:26 - one
35:26 - right so don't just limit yourself also
35:28 - for example this again remote work can
35:30 - be here
35:30 - right my work can be here work from
35:33 - anywhere right
35:34 - that's kind of the goal autumn next
35:35 - freelance what else do you what else
35:37 - do you think is a benefit from
35:38 - freelancing no man i think you kind of
35:40 - choose your own hours you don't
35:41 - necessarily have to work the court hours
35:43 - all the time right
35:44 - yeah yes choose your own up sorry
35:47 - oh my gosh i'm dying
35:51 - choo choo hours that's great because
35:52 - here again the full time you kind of
35:54 - have to do like a nine to five a lot of
35:56 - times right which is
35:57 - for some people it's fine right that
35:58 - doesn't you know for some people it's
36:00 - like you know no problem whatsoever as
36:01 - long as i
36:01 - love what i do and i'm making good money
36:04 - that's all that matters right so
36:05 - that's fine what else what do you think
36:08 - so i mean this could be a pro
36:09 - or a con but as a freelancer you're
36:12 - gonna have to be in charge of yourself
36:14 - so you're gonna do like your own
36:15 - marketing you're gonna have to find your
36:16 - own clients all those things right
36:18 - yeah so that could be a pro or con right
36:20 - if you want to do that if you want to go
36:22 - to those events to network with people
36:24 - to find your clients
36:25 - and it's a pro if you don't want to do
36:27 - that then it might be more of a con but
36:29 - you are in charge of your success
36:31 - specifically as a freelancer exactly so
36:33 - that's and yeah and sometimes
36:35 - it's good sometimes it's bad because if
36:36 - you can't be in charge yourself you
36:38 - can't be disciplined
36:39 - so that's what you have to be you have
36:40 - to be disciplined right so be
36:42 - disciplined yes and i'm sorry and if you
36:44 - can't be disciplined you cannot be a
36:45 - freelancer i'm sorry that's just that's
36:46 - just facts
36:47 - exactly if you can't get up for example
36:49 - if you can't hey because
36:51 - you have to you're the one getting
36:53 - clients you're the one who has to client
36:55 - management
36:56 - and project management right and sales
36:58 - that kind of stuff if you can't do that
37:00 - if you cannot be disciplined around that
37:02 - i'm sorry i think maybe full time would
37:04 - better for you right
37:05 - exactly but of course try it out and see
37:07 - how you how you work exactly exactly
37:09 - we're not here to tell you go one way or
37:10 - the other we're here to just give you
37:12 - the truth
37:13 - of both so that you can decide for
37:15 - yourself because either is perfectly
37:17 - fine
37:17 - you just want to make sure you're doing
37:19 - it for the right reasons yeah but you
37:20 - also
37:21 - yeah and with full time yes work is
37:23 - selected for you so you're not so much
37:24 - in charge of yourself
37:25 - but you do also but you also do have do
37:27 - have the option
37:28 - to select projects right to select your
37:30 - project right yeah so there's really
37:32 - nothing bad about full time
37:34 - i have done full time all a lot of a big
37:36 - part of my career
37:37 - i do also the freelancing and i'm also
37:39 - doing this right now so it's it's crazy
37:41 - right
37:41 - but also or do you have the and there's
37:43 - a full time there's nothing really bad
37:45 - you have to
37:45 - opt to select your own project no
37:47 - problem whatsoever yeah right
37:49 - at all adults so it's pretty good too
37:51 - all right awesome next up freelance what
37:53 - else do you think
37:53 - freelancing what i would say is one pro
37:55 - is select your own project
37:57 - amazing right right because if you have
38:00 - clients coming to you
38:01 - you could tell if you there's a project
38:03 - you're not passionate about you're not
38:04 - excited about you could say hey like
38:05 - refer them to someone else point them in
38:07 - another direction
38:08 - exactly i can get the help elsewhere and
38:09 - then the ones that you're excited about
38:10 - you're like i want to work on this
38:11 - exactly
38:12 - you can do that exactly and the cool
38:14 - thing is like you get to wear hats like
38:15 - it could be
38:16 - pro or con wear many many hats now i'm
38:19 - not actually saying like actual many
38:20 - hats like i don't have any hat right now
38:22 - but
38:22 - i want to wear five hats but i'm saying
38:24 - guys a hat
38:25 - see i'm trying to look but i mean like
38:29 - hats were like you get to be sales and
38:31 - project management and client management
38:32 - so you actually get to learn a lot as a
38:33 - freelancer at the same time too right
38:35 - and so and also one other thing i would
38:37 - say is
38:39 - you know your income income there's
38:41 - really no limit
38:43 - right but also getting to a higher limit
38:45 - to get into a higher income is also
38:47 - pretty hard so yeah
38:48 - right but i think the important thing is
38:49 - there it's flexibility
38:51 - yes the reality is yes you can work
38:55 - maybe even just 20 hours and still make
38:57 - the 70 000
38:58 - a year if you pick the right projects
39:00 - and you buy yourself
39:02 - those 20 hours a week instead of having
39:03 - to work to 40 hours a week right exactly
39:05 - you have that flexibility to choose
39:06 - whether you want to go really hard
39:08 - and go as hard as you can to make as
39:10 - much money or pull back so you have more
39:12 - time to spend with family
39:14 - to support your family to spend with
39:15 - friends whatever that is for you
39:16 - traveling
39:17 - whatever that is exactly so that's
39:18 - that's the really cool part about is the
39:20 - flexibility right
39:21 - is you've been able to work from
39:22 - anywhere you want and go anywhere so
39:23 - like if you want to stop working just
39:25 - stop working
39:25 - you know i mean of course not making
39:26 - money but still you know
39:28 - but i think the cool part here is the
39:30 - opportunity here um to learn is also on
39:32 - the full time is also pretty great so to
39:34 - learn
39:35 - right opportunity to learn because
39:36 - sometimes you're going to be put in a
39:37 - position
39:38 - where you're going to have amazing
39:39 - co-workers who are also smart and
39:41 - knowledgeable
39:42 - who you can talk to and leverage and
39:43 - learn from them so you can accelerate
39:45 - your learning process
39:46 - as well yeah mentorship right because as
39:49 - a freelancer you're kind of on your own
39:50 - that's that's the issue right you're
39:52 - very much on your own and you don't have
39:54 - any people to bounce off ideas
39:56 - from right you know and so that kind of
39:58 - can leave you feeling like oh i
40:00 - can't do this
40:01 - but when you're in a full-time job you
40:04 - know you're pretty much you're
40:05 - you're there with people and that's
40:06 - that's always amazing right oh i'm very
40:08 - i'm very extroverted actually i'm intro
40:10 - to slash extroverted
40:12 - but i love i know he's extroverted
40:15 - trust me i was introverted when i was in
40:17 - high school i was introverted like as
40:20 - trust me um so cool awesome so that's
40:22 - kind of that's gonna full time and let
40:24 - us know in the comments below
40:25 - from what you just seen right now guys
40:27 - that's in the comments below
40:28 - what do you think like which part are
40:30 - you are you freelance
40:32 - yeah or do you see some full-time or
40:34 - maybe you see yourself both yes no
40:36 - you can actually do both right because
40:37 - you can have a full-time job
40:39 - and on the side pick up freelancing
40:41 - projects you're passionate about so
40:43 - there's nothing wrong with doing one or
40:45 - the other or both and again we're just
40:47 - here
40:47 - to kind of educate you guys on the
40:49 - different opportunities
40:51 - so that you could choose for yourself
40:52 - what's the best decision
40:54 - yeah exactly a lot of people saying full
40:56 - time a lot of people saying see both
40:58 - both amazing yeah we all a lot of people
41:00 - are saying both oh
41:02 - full time maybe on the future will will
41:04 - change
41:05 - both but a lot of both hassan says both
41:09 - that's amazing and also guys the cool
41:10 - thing is none of them are permanent like
41:12 - at any time you can go full time and if
41:14 - the move is right you could go over to
41:16 - freelancing
41:16 - yeah but you can also start as a
41:17 - freelancer and whenever time is right
41:19 - you can go over
41:20 - to full time so it's just cool because
41:22 - it's so flexible
41:23 - but again the thing is you have to be
41:24 - aware of your goals

43:06 - stack
43:07 - mastery coding bootcamp yeah exactly so

43:16 - transition and become that developer and
43:18 - get that dream job
43:19 - this is something you could do for the
43:21 - next 20 to 30 to 40 years of your life

43:25 - to five years or six months if you go to
43:28 - full stack mastery boot camp

43:31 - you wanna think
43:32 - long term what do you wanna be doing

43:36 - exactly right so make sure write this
43:37 - stuff down because as you write down you
43:39 - remember that's how
43:40 - it gets into your brain right but again
43:42 - you look at this as the career this is
43:44 - not just a short-term thing you just try
43:45 - it out and you quit no
43:46 - this is a long-term thing right you
43:49 - learn you put in time because you know
43:50 - what this is saying that says

44:15 - bro
44:17 - anyways so you got the long-term goal
44:19 - it's awesome let's go let's place up
44:20 - into now short-term goals okay
44:22 - now our short-term goals for example
44:24 - could be to learn javascript
44:25 - fundamentals in a month that's gonna be
44:27 - maybe your part
44:28 - one okay what i mean by fundamentals
44:30 - it's the first
44:31 - part so so let's go ahead and take a
44:33 - look at those right so
44:34 - if i go ahead and look at this write
44:36 - this stuff down write your journey down
44:37 - create a timeline for yourself and make
44:39 - a plan right when you make a plan

44:50 - okay so let's think about this okay
44:53 - part one you want to learn for example
44:55 - fundamentals of coding right so you want
44:57 - to get that
44:58 - you want to get a go ahead and get your

45:11 - for example
45:12 - you know it's going to be for example
45:13 - react.js okay right
45:15 - then once you learn the mentos maybe you
45:18 - want to get into more so okay
45:19 - let's go ahead and build more projects
45:20 - so third part three is gonna be for
45:22 - example build projects okay
45:24 - now of course during all this time
45:26 - you're still building building projects
45:27 - guys all right
45:28 - the whole time why are you doing
45:29 - fundamentals so while you are learning
45:31 - javascript
45:32 - while you learn regress you are doing
45:34 - fundamentals
45:36 - always and building projects always
45:39 - and i mean always forever and ever and
45:42 - ever forever
45:42 - ever right part three maybe you go ahead
45:46 - and you
45:46 - get into more of the back inside right
45:48 - so that might be for example node.js who
45:50 - knows
45:51 - right something we actually teach in
45:52 - profit javascript amazing stuff right
45:54 - there
45:54 - cool so node.js and then you maybe you
45:57 - maybe you build uh
45:58 - once you learn js you build more your
46:00 - full stack project so five
46:02 - build go ahead and say build full stack
46:04 - project
46:06 - right that's going to be what you do and
46:08 - then finally six that's when you go
46:10 - ahead and you start interviewing so
46:11 - start interviewing right
46:12 - so look at this at this point on step
46:15 - six you're already interviewing with
46:16 - companies
46:17 - how sick is that okay huge that's pretty
46:20 - pretty huge guys but of course
46:22 - you know you can't rush this stuff yes
46:24 - these steps are simple
46:26 - but i didn't say they were easy
46:29 - they were not easy okay you have to put
46:31 - the time you have to put in the work
46:33 - okay so when you're doing this kind of
46:35 - stuff right guys fundamentals that's
46:37 - going to take you some time maybe a
46:38 - month maybe or two react gs together
46:40 - with the fundamentals again
46:41 - going to take you maybe a month right in
46:43 - this course
46:44 - in our course right now you'll get the
46:46 - chance to learn some fundamentals
46:48 - to even kickstart right away your react
46:50 - gs knowledge okay
46:52 - so right there take this as a as an
46:55 - amazing opportunity for you to learn
46:57 - to kick-start your career this is why we
46:59 - say that this challenge
47:00 - this pride challenge covers pretty much
47:02 - the goodness all the stuff
47:03 - covers all this stuff and this stuff
47:06 - like so
47:06 - this challenge gets you to step five
47:08 - already step five
47:10 - like step five like what the what the
47:12 - heck days you're gonna you know
47:13 - step five exactly how amazing is that
47:15 - it's pretty insane i would say that
47:16 - cool and of course you have and let's go
47:19 - ahead and talk about the opportunities
47:20 - for
47:21 - react gs developers pretty simple guys
47:23 - so how big
47:24 - is this opportunity right when you
47:26 - become a react.js developer
47:28 - what is insight for you what can you
47:29 - actually do what can you actually
47:31 - achieve
47:32 - good question i know i ask good
47:34 - questions that's why i'm here i know
47:36 - so what do we what do we tell them i
47:38 - think we should uh tell them about the
47:40 - opportunities that are out there in the
47:41 - world right
47:42 - we actually went and took screenshots of
47:45 - specific opportunities as a full stack
47:47 - developer as a react.js developer front
47:49 - and back and everything
47:50 - look at this so guys a hundred and five
47:52 - k oh let me kind of move this pick that
47:54 - up
47:54 - 100 105k
47:58 - for a full stack developer seller that's
48:00 - average guys per year right
48:01 - average right that's insane of course it
48:04 - depends on where you are at
48:05 - if you're in california this might be
48:06 - more of course if you're somewhere else
48:08 - might be
48:09 - less this is the average okay next up
48:11 - for example
48:12 - for the front developer 77k per year
48:15 - now this is average numbers you can make
48:16 - it a lot more if you're really good at
48:18 - what you do right if you're really
48:20 - passionate about this
48:21 - okay passion always makes you earn
48:24 - more always i don't give a sh i'm trying
48:26 - to i'm trying not to swear because i
48:28 - think youtube brings us down when we
48:29 - swear
48:30 - oh that's it i think so but it doesn't
48:33 - does not
48:34 - freaking matter i need to have a little

51:08 - come down a little bit hold on
51:09 - don't worry i got my water
51:13 - all right i'm the coffee nozzle i'm also
51:16 - going to make it make sure you get some
51:17 - water guys very important for your for
51:19 - your
51:20 - advice
51:25 - so as a foster developer guys which is
51:27 - what you're going to learn in this
51:28 - challenge right now again if you're not
51:30 - in a challenge what are you doing link
51:31 - in the description below
51:32 - but and this right you have to write
51:35 - from developer
51:36 - you have to know how to become a
51:37 - back-end developer right that doesn't
51:38 - includes for example
51:39 - you know i'm backing again we'll explain
51:40 - what a back-end is back in if you don't
51:42 - know exactly what a back-end it's like
51:43 - imagine you log into facebook right you
51:45 - log into facebook right
51:46 - you put in your password on the back
51:48 - inside is where it checks your password
51:50 - and actually
51:51 - goes ahead sorry and it actually goes
51:54 - ahead
51:55 - and validates that you're a real person
51:56 - right that's the backing the front end
51:58 - is what you see on the front it's a very
52:00 - simple structure right
52:01 - database is all your data for example
52:03 - let's say facebook right
52:05 - data about you as a person it is saved
52:07 - where it's saving database
52:09 - so facebook has no database devops this
52:11 - is the stuff where like for example the
52:12 - server right
52:13 - so this stuff is where for example how
52:15 - do you think you can access
52:17 - facebook right that's because facebook
52:19 - is on a server this is called devops
52:20 - right
52:21 - now you don't have to learn this
52:22 - specifically to become a photo developer
52:24 - this is helpful
52:25 - right here and it's very nice and then
52:27 - finally you actually get
52:29 - you can actually be able to put the
52:31 - mobile app so with react.js which is
52:33 - what you're learning right now
52:34 - the igs allows you not only to build
52:37 - front end
52:38 - and the front applications but it also
52:40 - allows you to build guys
52:42 - mobile apps how cool is that
52:44 - that is absolutely amazing it's insane
52:46 - it's so
52:46 - crazy it's i'm so excited one library
52:49 - one framework can allow you to do
52:51 - all these different things so much so
52:52 - much so what does the front end look
52:54 - like we should dive into those specific
52:56 - details so first
52:57 - things that you have to learn right so
52:58 - that's html right that's css again i
53:01 - know
53:01 - these icons look weird but html css
53:03 - right then javascript right here okay
53:06 - then for example we have react gs right
53:08 - here okay this
53:09 - we have yet guys in this specific
53:11 - portion you're learning
53:24 - but that's not it guys you also get to
53:27 - learn this
53:28 - too so you get to learn all aspects of
53:30 - front end
53:31 - right and even back because this right
53:32 - here is not just from this right here is
53:33 - also back-end
53:34 - what's this called it's called firebase
53:36 - firearms go type this up guys if you're
53:38 - not sure what what that is guys
53:40 - i'll just give you a chance to go ahead
53:41 - and look it up by yourself this is
53:43 - called
53:43 - firebase okay pretty cool tool you'll
53:45 - get a chance to learn
53:46 - uh that's a vr database for us so again
53:48 - this is beginner friendly so if you
53:50 - don't know
53:51 - what any of these things are we'll break
53:53 - it down real quick
53:54 - so html is the structure of a web page
53:57 - very much like the skeleton of this
53:59 - little deadpool
54:00 - lego right yeah so so kind of like you
54:02 - know how you know how daniel looks like
54:03 - right now you see his face right now
54:04 - right now this is him right now right
54:06 - this is html right this is how he looks
54:08 - right he's got the beer and everything
54:10 - right that's that's html okay the css
54:14 - so i guess you can say that better says
54:16 - yes yes so css is how you make a website
54:19 - look beautiful
54:20 - and pretty and aesthetic right so to the
54:22 - structure we added this
54:24 - awesome red color we had the gun we
54:25 - added the sword we added deadpool and
54:27 - finally
54:28 - javascript is what makes a website fluid
54:30 - as well and it makes it function
54:32 - it makes it function just like how
54:34 - deadpool is
54:35 - dancing let's go let's go so like you
54:37 - see how daniel's dancing or me i'm
54:39 - dancing right so
54:40 - that's javascript right they're making
54:41 - us everything function right so
54:43 - everything for example you see on
54:44 - facebook focus you know and when you log
54:46 - into facebook
54:47 - that's javascript right being able to
54:49 - hit the login button and that transfers
54:50 - you
54:51 - over to another page that in my friends
54:54 - is
54:54 - javascript it's a very simple structure
54:56 - okay
54:57 - and you'll get to learn all of those in
55:00 - this challenge so if you're not in there
55:01 - what are you doing i don't even know i
55:03 - i can't question you anymore so html
55:06 - learn the basics make it page make it
55:07 - work don't ever complicate it right html
55:10 - is the you is the view i know sorry
55:14 - is the view it is what you see don't
55:15 - worry guys i got water
55:17 - so ishmael is what you see right html
55:19 - css it is the
55:21 - really really pretty stuff right learn
55:23 - how to use different layouts like
55:25 - flexbox
55:26 - response design media queries midi quiz
55:29 - for example is when you switch out for
55:30 - example from
55:31 - a bigger screen right a bigger screen to
55:33 - a smaller screen right or to mobile
55:35 - screen
55:35 - how does your site change as you do that
55:38 - that's the big question right how does
55:39 - your site change well it's pretty simple
55:40 - again
55:41 - it's using something called media
55:43 - queries okay
55:45 - all right let's keep going next up and
55:46 - finally javascript master the
55:48 - fundamentals guys
55:49 - data types something you need to learn
55:51 - hundred percent you know you need to
55:53 - learn
55:53 - things like for example let me take a
55:55 - look at this things like
55:57 - uh well stacks things like you know
55:59 - stacks
56:00 - and again do not over complicate
56:02 - yourself don't worry you don't need to
56:04 - learn this just right now not the most
56:05 - important thing but you will get to
56:07 - learn
56:07 - this later on as you get going into your
56:10 - career
56:10 - as a reactor as developer right stacks
56:12 - cues like lists so much more
56:14 - you have to learn things like functions
56:16 - like what's a function right like what
56:17 - is a function actually i'm curious
56:20 - a function is a piece of code
56:23 - that allows your software to actually
56:26 - perform something
56:27 - so very similar to how we saw deadpool
56:29 - dancing and he was given
56:31 - function he was giving life the function
56:33 - allows you to actually
56:34 - execute something and actually do
56:36 - something correct correct so
56:37 - that's what function function does it's
56:39 - kind of like its own little thing
56:41 - in in terms of execution just have a car
56:43 - has you know
56:44 - wheels right which function to drive the
56:46 - car your gas pedal is you know to
56:48 - to have you go fast right they have
56:50 - their own different functions
56:52 - we have the same thing in coding down
56:54 - manipulation
56:55 - that's basically being able to
56:56 - manipulate what you see on the front end
56:57 - right so when you have cool animations
56:59 - or even here for example here as i'm
57:00 - drawing right
57:01 - this is called dom manipulation right
57:03 - i'm manipulating the view
57:04 - it's as simple as that scope this scope
57:06 - is kind of like
57:08 - i won't get too technical away but scope
57:09 - is basically just where you can do what
57:12 - you can do so it's like
57:13 - because you can't do everything with
57:14 - everything exactly i know i don't keep
57:16 - this confusing to give it to you i know
57:18 - it's
57:18 - everything with everything and the fetch
57:19 - api is you being able to communicate
57:21 - with different resources online
57:23 - so facebook for example communicates
57:24 - with different resources it communicates
57:26 - with their server
57:27 - it communicates with all the different
57:29 - applications to be able to log you in
57:31 - and stuff like that okay
57:32 - comprende good so you might be asking
57:34 - why
57:35 - javascript well pretty simple i mean if
57:37 - you take a look at this
57:38 - here are some tab companies they use i
57:40 - mean linkedin right facebook
57:42 - microsoft ebay tesla groupon netflix
57:46 - google uber tinder airbnb
57:49 - people guys it goes on and on
57:53 - anything on the web uses javascript html
57:57 - css and react.js is like kind of the
58:00 - it's kind of the the how do i say this
58:03 - the topping
58:04 - on the top no the the what's it called
58:06 - the cherry on top the chicken yeah the
58:07 - cherry on top
58:08 - i don't know what are you trying to say
58:09 - i'm just trying to make you fancy man
58:11 - yes
58:11 - cherry on top react gs that's the cherry
58:15 - on top that makes everything work very
58:16 - nicely it makes it easier for us to work
58:18 - okay
58:18 - so that's that's the whole goal now guys
58:20 - let us know in the comments below who
58:21 - wants to work for any of these companies

61:51 - is that a good question that's an
61:52 - amazing question guys that's an amazing
61:54 - question because you're about to learn
61:55 - javascript you're about to learn react
61:56 - to yes
61:57 - what can you do with it well what can
61:59 - you tell me well you could definitely do
62:00 - some web apps because that just showed
62:01 - up on the slide
62:02 - so what's a web app a web app is a web
62:04 - application so we talked about full
62:06 - stack development where you have
62:07 - a nice ui you have a database in the
62:09 - back and it's actually able to do
62:11 - something functional right yes
62:13 - next oh you could do a native
62:15 - application
62:16 - so native application would be a
62:18 - specific application for mobile phones
62:20 - like
62:21 - an ios phone an android phone
62:24 - or microsoft phone still a thing i don't
62:26 - know no it's not
62:28 - sorry not microsoft on there yeah no no
62:30 - no so here for example here for example
62:32 - guys
62:32 - um actually native apps tesla app is
62:34 - actually built with react native just as
62:36 - well
62:36 - yep desk lab is fully built with react
62:37 - native tesla is actually built with
62:39 - react
62:40 - react gs native so you are learning here
62:42 - in reg.js not only for front end not
62:44 - only to build web apps right
62:46 - but you're also learning to build crazy
62:48 - like apps like tesla apps
62:50 - like that's insane right i use that app
62:52 - i use that app yeah it's a pretty good
62:53 - app
62:54 - man if only tesla cars were built with
62:56 - react js that'd be epic okay that's
62:58 - interesting
63:00 - and the server apps of course node.js
63:01 - right here so server apps
63:03 - are backing applications and that also
63:05 - use javascript okay cool
63:06 - next up so how to make money in
63:08 - javascript that's a good question okay
63:09 - well think about this guys how to make
63:11 - money how do you want to make money as
63:13 - a javascript developer again pretty
63:15 - simple stuff here
63:18 - not easy right no simple but not easy of
63:20 - course so
63:21 - i love this guys give a shout out to
63:24 - friends show i love them so much
63:26 - i'm the teacher so one of the ways in
63:29 - which you can do it guys
63:30 - is actually through teaching and
63:32 - coaching so
63:34 - the really cool part about this is why
63:36 - what's the cool part about this daniel
63:38 - well what's cool is you don't need to be
63:40 - super
63:41 - masterful to be able to teach and coach
63:43 - you just need to be
63:45 - two to three steps ahead of the person
63:46 - you're coaching and teaching because
63:48 - you already learned those things and you
63:49 - can offer value to them yeah
63:51 - in that situation you don't need to be a
63:53 - pro right you don't need to be a
63:54 - professional
63:55 - five years of experience you have
63:56 - experience you literally just need a
63:58 - couple months
63:59 - no or even then just like you just need
64:00 - to know the next two steps exactly
64:02 - the thing is we'll talk a little about
64:04 - that later on in a second here but
64:05 - that's the cool part about
64:07 - coding is that you can teach anybody so
64:09 - for example if you're like level one
64:10 - level two right you can if you're let's
64:12 - say level two which is you know just a
64:13 - little bit right
64:14 - you can teach level one if you're level
64:16 - three you can teach level two level one
64:18 - right and oh there's all so many
64:20 - websites on which you can teach we and
64:22 - we have so many students
64:23 - that actually do that and they make an
64:26 - extra 500 bucks and we'll get into
64:28 - what you can make in a second here but
64:30 - they make 500 a thousand bucks extra
64:32 - right rishi actually rishi he makes a
64:34 - makes an extra 1000k i think somebody
64:36 - named
64:37 - 2k no actually just from teaching and
64:39 - coaching
64:40 - right it's insane yeah it's pretty
64:42 - amazing cool so let's go ahead that's
64:44 - that's pretty cool teaching coaching and
64:45 - again
64:46 - make sure you guys are taking pictures
64:47 - make sure you're taking screenshots
64:49 - by the way i want to add a cool thing
64:51 - about coaching and teaching is
64:52 - you kind of re-learn what you already
64:55 - learned you get to reinforce those
64:56 - things because now when you're trying to
64:58 - coach it
64:58 - you have to learn it at a more deeper
65:00 - and technical level so it just enforces
65:02 - everything you've done so yes of course
65:03 - okay let's talk about what your
65:05 - stream of income in the first one want
65:06 - to thrive for three months
65:08 - while learning javascript coding looks
65:10 - like okay so
65:11 - now again this stuff only applies if you
65:13 - are working hard guys very important
65:15 - work hard right do your best i say and
65:19 - forget
65:19 - the rest okay work hard because nothing
65:22 - pays off like hard work
65:23 - all right cool next up by teaching
65:26 - javascript to students who are the one
65:28 - level behind your learning that's how
65:30 - the first time we're going to make right
65:32 - then let's go ahead and take a look at
65:33 - this so how here's the question how okay
65:36 - generally one student will pay you let's
65:38 - say 50 bucks okay so let's go ahead and
65:40 - let's we'll calculate this one so 50
65:41 - bucks per hour okay
65:42 - and work with you two hours in one
65:44 - session okay so let's think about it so
65:46 - you're in one session
65:47 - you make how much once you make what a
65:49 - hundred bucks okay
65:50 - a hundred bucks okay so that's like for
65:52 - example you have just
65:54 - learned so let's say you've just learned
65:56 - for example
65:57 - some basic javascript right and you want
65:59 - to teach you know some basic javascript
66:01 - heck
66:01 - you built you built a slack clone and
66:04 - you went to this react.js challenge
66:05 - and now you have some good experience
66:08 - right
66:08 - well let's think about this you have one
66:10 - student that pays you two hours for one
66:12 - session
66:13 - let's say the one session you have one
66:14 - per week okay like one session per week
66:16 - okay
66:17 - so 100 that's 100 bucks per week
66:20 - for one month that's how much
66:23 - four sessions per month ish yes that's
66:26 - how much
66:27 - how much money is that oh 400. so that's
66:28 - 400 bucks per month correct so far
66:30 - 400 400 per month right right
66:33 - how much is that per year that will be
66:36 - 400 times 12 which is 4
66:38 - 800. so 4 800 per year guys
66:42 - that's extra money of just you putting
66:44 - two hours in
66:45 - right two hours in to coaching someone
66:49 - something that you've learned not sorry
66:52 - not too
66:52 - long ago right not too long ago and you
66:55 - know some basic stuff
66:56 - but the cool part about this is not only
66:58 - are you making
66:59 - right not only making four thousand look
67:00 - at this now they're making four thousand
67:01 - eight hundred per year
67:02 - but also you're also learning more
67:05 - because there's a saying
67:07 - learning you learn more when you teach
67:08 - right what is the same call you learn
67:10 - more when you teach
67:10 - learn more thank you
67:14 - when you teach right right so this is
67:17 - the big
67:18 - part about teaching and we've emphasized
67:20 - this so much
67:21 - right so that's only one student guys
67:24 - so from one student could be making 4
67:26 - 800 bucks
67:28 - who down the comments below who wants to
67:30 - be able to make
67:31 - an extra 4 800 or 5 thousand dollars
67:34 - you know extra per year just like that
67:37 - from one session
67:38 - dropped in the comments and this is what
67:39 - we call this upward spiral of success
67:42 - because as you're coaching more students
67:44 - you're learning more
67:45 - but you're also getting paid more so you
67:47 - want to do that activity you're having
67:48 - more fun
67:48 - so you coach more students and you get
67:50 - paid more and you have more fun and then
67:52 - it's just happiness
67:53 - all the way up to the top right yes and
67:55 - this is a way that you could definitely
67:56 - achieve that
67:57 - yes of course 100 and let's say okay so
68:00 - you have one student but let's say you
68:01 - have two students okay
68:02 - let's say you have two two students how
68:03 - much is that per year now uh we would
68:05 - double that
68:06 - nine thousand nine thousand six hundred
68:08 - that's nine times six hundred so two
68:09 - students
68:10 - right that's already all let me call it
68:12 - this out two students that's already
68:14 - guys
68:14 - nine thousand six hundred right there
68:18 - like seriously right that's 10k
68:21 - 10k per year for some people that is
68:23 - their that is full minimum wage right
68:25 - for some people who are working
68:27 - per year right and they're making
68:28 - they're working 40 hours per week
68:30 - or 40 hours per week right but here you
68:32 - have two students and you coaching them
68:33 - and not only are you coaching
68:34 - you're learning and you're doing
68:36 - something positive for yourself right
68:38 - so that's how we offset this so much but
68:40 - that doesn't stop there guys
68:42 - it does not stop there because let's say
68:45 - now
68:45 - you get better at it now you increase
68:47 - your price from 50
68:49 - per hour right 50 per hour per hour
68:53 - to now how much let's say 60 or 75 per
68:55 - hour yeah
68:56 - you know that's you could actually do
68:58 - that 100
69:01 - i charge 250 per hour yo let's go
69:05 - you know you can get that right you can
69:07 - get to that point right
69:08 - so slowly slowly slowly increase
69:10 - increase increase your pricing
69:11 - right and guys and i'm just saying this
69:13 - stuff not to just be all fancy i'm
69:15 - saying this this is a real world right
69:17 - right people will pay that kind of that
69:19 - kind of money right if you find them
69:20 - right they are people but you also have
69:22 - to develop that skill to get to our
69:23 - nozzles of like two
69:25 - or 250 an hour right you just can't come
69:27 - off the bat you have to teach you
69:28 - functions and
69:29 - objects yeah for 250 and then no that's
69:31 - just not gonna work right so you have to
69:32 - get to that right
69:33 - but how this is why i say take this
69:35 - stuff what you're learning right now so
69:37 - so importantly okay guys all right let's
69:39 - go ahead and move on so
69:40 - uh really quickly move on so that's a
69:43 - hundred dollars per person like i said
69:44 - so to make your monthly more income from
69:46 - one student that's 400 per month we said
69:47 - that okay cool
69:48 - so how can you get an actual coaching
69:50 - client right yeah what can you start to
69:51 - do so you can so how do you do that okay
69:53 - again write this stuff down guys very
69:55 - very very very
69:56 - importante okay
70:00 - well that's going can you make that
70:02 - again thank you there we go it always
70:04 - looks i don't know why that happens all
70:05 - the time
70:06 - but so let's go ahead and let's say that
70:09 - you dm 100 people on facebook right
70:11 - now you might be asking okay how do you
70:13 - dm 100 people
70:14 - well you might get 100 people through a
70:16 - few tools okay so for example
70:18 - let me just let's think about this uh
70:20 - i'm gonna put frisbee done
70:22 - so that might be through facebook so you
70:24 - may be your facebook group
70:25 - right you go to a facebook group you
70:27 - find a javascript facebook
70:29 - or react.js facebook group a coding
70:31 - facebook group okay boom right there
70:33 - that right there right there by the way
70:35 - gives opportunity to dm people
70:36 - now don't spam because they'll throw you
70:38 - out but make sure make sure
70:41 - make sure that you're just simply just
70:43 - giving value okay
70:44 - maybe you go through craigslist right so
70:47 - you say hey i will go ahead and provide
70:49 - free lessons or maybe lessons to you for
70:51 - 25 an hour or 15 hour
70:52 - right now right and maybe you can sign
70:54 - up with some free lessons just to get
70:55 - your foot in the door right craig's
70:57 - list right what other tools can i use
71:00 - to be able to find people i mean just
71:02 - even then other social medias
71:04 - like facebook's if you have your
71:05 - personal one right you could go into
71:07 - instagram
71:08 - linkedin right i mean whoever it is that
71:10 - people are that
71:11 - want to learn how to code you just have
71:13 - to think about where can i find these
71:15 - people
71:15 - yeah now again this stuff is really
71:17 - simple guys how do you do
71:18 - how do you get to this stuff right how
71:20 - do you get people to trust you because
71:21 - the biggest
71:22 - reason why people get nowhere is because
71:25 - of trust okay
71:26 - because of trust they don't trust you so
71:28 - this is why we say it's so important
71:30 - share what you're doing on social media
71:32 - if people see
71:33 - that you are sharing coding you're
71:35 - saying yes right
71:36 - they trust you if they see you partying
71:38 - they're not gonna trust you i'm sorry
71:39 - that's not somebody that you they're
71:41 - going to trust
71:41 - i'm not going to trust somebody who
71:42 - parties in pictures all the time and
71:44 - says uh yeah yeah yeah they are going to
71:46 - teach me
71:47 - hell no no i want someone who has
71:50 - pictures of coding
71:51 - and their journey on how they're
71:52 - learning to code that is someone who i'm
71:54 - gonna be building a relationship with
71:56 - like wow i want to learn
71:57 - from them exactly okay respond let's say
72:00 - 20 people respond to you
72:01 - okay five people you're gonna call or
72:03 - show they are interested you close one
72:05 - when you say close meaning you sign up
72:07 - one person
72:08 - that's thirty two hundred three hundred
72:09 - and twenty dollars per month from one
72:11 - pain student
72:12 - boom right but you have to be able to
72:14 - put in the work this stuff right here
72:15 - guys right
72:16 - this stuff is not easy this stuff makes
72:18 - you make sure you put in the work
72:20 - right you have to dm 100 people they
72:22 - won't come
72:23 - magically to you i'm sorry that's just
72:25 - not going to happen
72:26 - right so they have to do it okay cool
72:28 - next up
72:30 - like we said you know this is simple but
72:31 - not easy you have to put in that hard
72:33 - work
72:33 - so if you want to make 3 dollars per
72:35 - month or three or thirty six thousand
72:37 - dollars per year you'll have to do 10x
72:38 - more work right
72:40 - you have to do 10x more clients right so
72:42 - where can i find these javascript
72:43 - students to coach well pretty simple
72:44 - you're going to want to take a
72:45 - screenshot really simple of this but go
72:47 - ahead nas so
72:48 - facebook group part one instagram part
72:50 - two why isn't really important for those
72:52 - who are in us
72:53 - why isn't is a great way to get started
72:55 - we have a lot so many people even we
72:57 - have lam
72:57 - one of the coaches uh lemon's actually
73:00 - out did we have lemon
73:01 - on the thing i don't think we did i
73:03 - maybe not
73:04 - so lamb is actually another he actually
73:06 - is a new is someone who's new who joined
73:08 - our team as well
73:09 - he does weizen as well and he's been
73:11 - doing wiser for a long time that's
73:13 - has been for a big part of him was was
73:15 - his primary work guys right
73:17 - it's been killing and wise end right
73:19 - take lessons right
73:20 - people per hour i mean craigslist upwork
73:24 - fiverr fiverr is a big one for those of
73:26 - you for those of you
73:28 - let me go ahead and i know those of you
73:30 - who are
73:31 - in other countries maybe you're not in
73:33 - us that's fine there's still a lot of
73:35 - opportunities
73:36 - fiverr is a good one linkedin is a good
73:38 - one right craigslist is a good one
73:40 - people per hour is a good one instagram
73:42 - all these other ones are still still
73:44 - applicable to you
73:45 - just the wise and then ticklish might
73:46 - not be applicable to you right so that's
73:48 - pretty much it but
73:49 - these are applicable guys these are
73:51 - applicable cool
73:52 - and more of course so working from home
73:55 - that's the cool really cool part that
73:56 - you get to do when you work from home
73:57 - guys exactly so that was being a coach
74:00 - being a mentor to someone so what is
74:02 - another way not that people can start to
74:04 - make money
74:05 - online as a developer well pretty simple
74:08 - guys
74:08 - you can also do freelancing so let's say
74:10 - you first do coaching correct you did
74:12 - coaching that was your first part
74:14 - now you feel like you've gone to a
74:15 - certain level you know your stuff
74:17 - okay maybe now you want to find clients
74:19 - and do some coaching
74:21 - up freelance and freelancing yeah and
74:24 - you pick up a project right yeah yeah
74:25 - so what you do is you go to upwork for
74:27 - example or freelancer.com let me
74:29 - go ahead and put those names down on
74:30 - here so let me go blah blah blah
74:34 - i'm gonna put this down so for example
74:36 - you go to free and free free
74:39 - freelancer right or let's say you go to
74:42 - upwork for example upwork
74:45 - i know i know it's so small upwork for
74:47 - example right
74:48 - you go those sites and they give you
74:50 - opportunity to find clients
74:51 - oh heck maybe you find a friend who
74:54 - needs a work right a friend a friend
74:56 - right
74:57 - that's actually the best way to get your
74:59 - first freelancing client is actually
75:00 - through people you know
75:01 - yes because word of mouth and referrals
75:03 - are very very powerful
75:05 - very if you can for example call up your
75:08 - you know mom dad pops you know grandpa
75:12 - grandma
75:12 - and they know somebody or your friends
75:14 - right and they know somebody who might
75:16 - need some work done
75:18 - maybe it's a website do it do it do it
75:20 - do it
75:21 - right because getting the first gig is
75:24 - the hardest thing
75:25 - for freelancers okay and so i highly
75:28 - recommend you and
75:29 - getting trust to do that first job is
75:32 - the hardest thing part as well
75:34 - yeah cause once you have that trust you
75:35 - build more projects you add to your
75:37 - portfolio
75:38 - now people can look back at those
75:39 - projects and be like wow like nas has
75:41 - done
75:42 - all these amazing projects they're going
75:44 - to be a perfect fit
75:45 - for the website that i need to be built
75:47 - exactly exactly
75:49 - and once you have your first client guys
75:52 - that's it you can how you have your
75:53 - second client
75:54 - and your third client and then you can
75:55 - increase your

78:25 - part and you can be doing all those
78:26 - three guys
78:26 - at the same time right freelancing
78:29 - permanent job right
78:30 - and we talk about the benefits to
78:31 - permanent job to freelancing to full
78:33 - time
78:34 - right those all those three aspects are
78:37 - opportunities for you to become
78:38 - become developers okay all right let's
78:40 - go ahead and move on so
78:42 - as we've said okay i love this part one
78:44 - this is your pyramid
78:45 - of success of wealth this is how we get
78:48 - the wealth
78:49 - okay okay what's number one all right so
78:52 - part one
78:53 - is you learn of course at first you have
78:54 - to develop some skills okay you have to
78:56 - go ahead
78:57 - develop some skills right here okay
79:00 - learn
79:00 - javascript learn react.js okay this is
79:03 - why you are
79:04 - here you're in the learning phase right
79:05 - now maybe you're someone else maybe
79:07 - you're learning react.js
79:08 - but maybe you already know javascript
79:09 - who knows but if you're complete
79:11 - beginner you're currently here right
79:13 - here that's your step okay
79:14 - after that step maybe you do coaching
79:16 - right
79:17 - so the coaching again that requires a
79:19 - skill level of only a beginner okay only
79:21 - beginner
79:22 - and you teach coding to other people
79:24 - right so again
79:25 - time to build stream income one or three
79:26 - months so in one month you could be
79:28 - looking at potentially coaching other
79:29 - people
79:30 - granted we've had students who joined
79:33 - this challenge
79:34 - and we're teaching other people within a
79:36 - week of this challenge
79:38 - five days guys i'm not kidding five days
79:40 - right so
79:41 - there's a lot of opportunities here and
79:42 - that's the income of 3000k per month
79:44 - right 2000 per month
79:45 - next up we have freelancing right to
79:47 - work for clients independently
79:48 - and that requires intermediate skills so
79:50 - at this point you have to make know some
79:52 - coding right
79:53 - you have to be able to build some
79:54 - projects right and that's the streaming
79:56 - of you might be up
79:57 - within four to 12 months that's about 5k
80:00 - per
80:00 - month okay awesome now next up let's go
80:03 - ahead after you do freelancing
80:05 - you might be looking at a full-time job
80:07 - that's the advanced
80:08 - level right there but it's advanced with
80:11 - a grain of salt
80:12 - why to be able to get to that point
80:16 - you definitely just need to develop a
80:18 - lot of skills when you're going there
80:20 - right
80:20 - and i mean in terms of the time we do
80:22 - have the 12 to 24 months
80:24 - but it's just going to depend a lot on
80:26 - your specific
80:27 - journey and what you do i mean if you
80:28 - happen to go into something like
80:30 - um full stack mastery boot camp that
80:33 - might be a little bit faster
80:34 - it might not take 12 to 24 months of
80:37 - javascript or profit with javascript as
80:39 - well right
80:39 - it's going to speed up because you're
80:40 - investing into mentors that are going to
80:42 - help you to speed up that process to
80:44 - speed up that journey
80:45 - exactly exactly so all the different
80:47 - parts of your job look
80:48 - let's switch back to here guys are
80:50 - really important right and all this
80:52 - income let's say you do all this right
80:53 - here
80:54 - you maybe let's say you do coaching you
80:55 - know for example rishi in our
80:57 - who was our student initially and now is
80:59 - just killing it with students and
81:01 - has a job and everything he was doing
81:02 - freelancing right let's say you do all
81:04 - this stuff so you do income or three
81:06 - keep a month then five key per month
81:07 - let's say do freelancing
81:08 - and i also have a full-time job you're
81:09 - looking around 15k per month as
81:12 - a full developer now i won't lie to you
81:14 - right this stuff
81:15 - takes takes a lot of work and a lot of
81:18 - patience okay
81:19 - you can't get to this within a day or
81:21 - two days
81:22 - right it's gonna take a lot of work so
81:24 - that's really important and you might
81:26 - not be able to do everything all once
81:28 - that's just simple as that maybe you
81:29 - just simply do coaching
81:31 - maybe you just do freelancing maybe you
81:33 - find out to yourself that it's really
81:34 - hard for you to do all these three so
81:36 - you just stick to one which is just
81:38 - simply
81:38 - job the cool part about it is when you
81:40 - stick to one guys
81:42 - is you have the opportunity to really
81:44 - grow this income 70 per month
81:46 - that's just starting you can scale that
81:47 - 8k 10k
81:49 - like 15k you can focus on that yes just
81:51 - on the just on the full-time job
81:53 - and i actually i actually recommend
81:56 - a lot of people to do to do that kind of
81:59 - focus
81:59 - focus on one thing at a time and
82:02 - sometimes of course you have to spread
82:03 - yourself a little bit
82:04 - thin like we ourselves here me daniel we
82:07 - spread ourselves thin here at this point
82:08 - right
82:09 - between coaching others to doing live
82:11 - streams to doing you know so many
82:12 - different things in the company
82:13 - we love it but we've we've given
82:16 - ourselves time
82:17 - to learn this stuff yeah right but then
82:19 - just kind of like hey guys
82:21 - just do everything no we give ourselves
82:23 - subscribe to learn it okay

84:17 - four three two one
84:20 - and now bye-bye okay cool so math
84:23 - breakdown for making three keep per
84:24 - month with coaching javascript uh or
84:26 - simplified again so get
84:28 - five percent of the people that you
84:29 - reach out to will become your clients so
84:30 - let's say you reach out to 100 people
84:32 - that's how many people
84:33 - five people right so you reach out to
84:35 - 500 people a hundred people will become
84:37 - your clients it's a five percent close
84:39 - rate we'll say for example right that's
84:40 - what we say
84:41 - so come on right there so five people
84:44 - your clients right but you have to reach
84:47 - out to them of course you have to reach
84:49 - out to 100
84:50 - 100 clients don't disappear out of
84:51 - nowhere that's really important guys to
84:53 - consider
84:53 - okay next up if you reach out to 100
84:56 - people you will get five billion
84:57 - students
84:57 - let's say each student will pay you 50
84:59 - per hour that is how much
85:00 - 50 per hour so five students times 50
85:03 - 250 250
85:04 - 250 and let's say you have five students
85:06 - let's say in one week
85:08 - that's 250 in one week yes that's pretty
85:11 - damn good guys
85:12 - and then you multiply that by four
85:13 - that's how much
85:16 - how much that are you throwing a lot of
85:17 - math at me i'm not even thinking bro
85:18 - give me come on
85:20 - dude that's a thousand cape thousand
85:22 - dollars all right
85:24 - well let's let's a thousand dollars

85:31 - 000
85:34 - oh my god thousand dollars right there
85:36 - guys that's insane cool
85:37 - awesome so let's go ahead so javascript

85:41 - this point is a pretty pretty insane
85:42 - tool guys
85:43 - there's so many opportunities right in
85:44 - terms of jobs as you can see right here
85:46 - if we go ahead and search up front
85:47 - developer right there that's ten
85:48 - thousand jobs right there and actually
85:50 - if we search up
85:51 - if we go hey my god i'm going to exit
85:53 - this if i go here for example i say
85:55 - indeed
85:57 - let's go to here actually i'm going to
85:58 - go indeed.com here and let's just say i
86:01 - search up javascript
86:03 - let's say javascript yeah guys i mean
86:05 - these are the current opportunities that
86:06 - are out there right now so look at this
86:08 - guys just check this out okay let me go
86:10 - ahead and zoom in on this okay
86:11 - somebody command plus right right
86:14 - look at this guys 59 000 pretty much
86:17 - almost 60 000 jobs for javascript
86:21 - developers the demand is there
86:23 - you just have to go ahead simply just
86:25 - put in the time and that's pretty much
86:27 - it okay demand is there right just put
86:30 - the time
86:30 - put in the hard work and you will get
86:32 - there let's get that for example let's
86:33 - go and take a look at react gs let's
86:35 - just think about this react
86:37 - reactor react gs react gs for example
86:41 - react gs 2000 uh hold on two thousand
86:44 - eight hundred feet we say for example
86:45 - react for example
86:48 - sixty four thousand more than javascript
86:50 - yeah right there so react
86:51 - 64 000 jobs just like that like holy
86:54 -  man
86:55 - that's around the world right now
86:56 - opportunity is there for you to just
86:59 - grab it
87:00 - and cease the moment yes yes yes yes
87:03 - guys
87:03 - so many opportunities look at that
87:05 - salary holy
87:07 - actually let's think about this let me
87:08 - see senior developer
87:10 - 150k 200k per year let's think about
87:12 - this what are they looking for
87:14 - qualifications one year preferred the
87:16 - hell are you serious this is a senior
87:17 - developer
87:18 - no way no way i'm about to submit my
87:20 - application send me that link bro
87:23 - so look at this guys right so looking
87:25 - for example
87:27 - react aws remember how we talked about
87:29 - the devops front
87:30 - full stack right there see devops
87:32 - backhand full stack no
87:34 - react so in this case right so node for
87:36 - example is a back end
87:37 - framework react as a frontend framework
87:39 - you will in this case you will get to
87:40 - learn react
87:41 - and a little part of node kind of how it
87:43 - works right you won't necessarily
87:45 - use node but you will use firebase
87:47 - instead of that kind of to build your
87:49 - back end okay
87:50 - so a lot a lot look at this
87:53 - 150k to 200 key per year
87:56 - holy 401k matching dental insurance
88:01 - oh my god flexible uh life insurance pay
88:04 - time off tuition embarrassment holy
88:06 - who wants to work for this company down
88:08 - below drop in the comments below guys
88:09 - send them the link bro
88:12 - all right so you can see opportunities
88:15 - are there you just have to take them
88:16 - okay
88:18 - awesome so cool so as we're nearing kind
88:20 - of the end guys again these are just
88:21 - some examples all right such
88:22 - opportunities and salary as you can see
88:24 - it just it just doesn't end right like
88:26 - the opportunities are literally
88:28 - limitless in the world of javascript in
88:30 - the world of full stack development from
88:32 - development yes yes yes so less than one
88:34 - year for here one to four years probably
88:35 - nine years
88:36 - again and these are average salaries
88:38 - right here 100k 92k 82k 75k 107k
88:41 - all those are sellers right there so
88:43 - look at this but again like you said
88:46 - at that time where we screenshotted that
88:48 - when javascript had 45k
88:49 - jobs now i had what 60k 60k so it
88:53 - increases it's going up like crazy
88:55 - for up work for example if you type in
88:57 - javascript outbreak is a freelancing uh
88:59 - job you're looking at around 8 000 jobs
89:03 - opportunities freelancing opportunities
89:05 - wow what the
89:09 - so okay next for example these are the
89:11 - countries which shown the most interest
89:13 - and demand for javascript programming
89:15 - usa
89:16 - 5750 per month canada united uk
89:20 - and germany and again because of covet
89:22 - because just in general
89:24 - all these jobs can now be remote so no
89:26 - matter where you are guys
89:28 - right no matter where you are you will
89:30 - have the chance
89:32 - to actually go ahead you have the chance
89:34 - to
89:35 - work for these companies even for your
89:37 - nigeria
89:38 - india right even if you're in different
89:40 - countries like who knows australia
89:43 - i mean i don't know where else might
89:44 - they be spain any other country that's
89:46 - like
89:47 - any other country by remote right it's
89:50 - remote

89:57 - 100 developer jobs companies hiring amid
90:00 - the chronovirus

90:03 - right because
90:05 - you know we don't need people in the
90:07 - office at the end of the day
90:08 - you know coding is remote so necessarily
90:11 - needed so coco does not really affect us

92:15 - with react.js and then
92:16 - because since you are in this course
92:18 - right now and you will get go ahead and
92:20 - learn that so holy that's a really
92:22 - sick background by the way
92:23 - it is right i know explosion that's
92:25 - amazing so
92:26 - what companies are using what frameworks
92:29 - well for example okay let's think about
92:30 - this okay
92:31 - um airbnb gs instagram
92:34 - uber e it's dropbox ugs alibaba
92:37 - grammarly look at this all the cool
92:40 - under react js is what i'm seeing
92:42 - right so this is react.js right here
92:43 - right airbnb instagram ubereats dropbox
92:46 - um i don't have on here but in tesla for
92:48 - example tesla for example user regis
92:50 - um netflix uses react.js i know if you
92:53 - know that as well they use node.js
92:55 - for the back end um so many more
92:57 - companies
92:58 - lgs paypal all broke sony and i think
93:00 - google you google used it uh
93:02 - angular as well too so again they're all
93:04 - different options all many options you
93:06 - know but again not the most important
93:07 - just pick one and start stick with one
93:09 - whichever one
93:10 - so what shall i choose that's good
93:11 - question that's a great question as you
93:13 - see
93:13 - this right here is something called a
93:15 - stack overflow survey
93:17 - what is that a stack overflow survey
93:19 - well one of
93:20 - stack is like one of the biggest
93:22 - websites for devs
93:24 - and the survey is when they ask people
93:25 - questions so they went to the big
93:27 - website of developers and asked them
93:29 - what front-end framework are using
93:33 - should you use do you want and look at
93:35 - this amazing response guys
93:37 - yes so react gs is the most wanted
93:39 - dynasty we have ugs then we have
93:41 - angular okay and the angularjs now i
93:43 - actually started with angularjs when i
93:45 - started a long
93:45 - time ago yeah a long time ago i started
93:47 - with angularjs yes react.js at that
93:49 - point when i started was
93:50 - not popular not very popular that was
93:52 - like seven years ago or something
93:53 - so i didn't have the chance to work with
93:55 - react but now because the community
93:58 - and because the support it's just grown
94:00 - to an immense
94:01 - it's huge and that's why we're making
94:03 - this challenge so everyone right now
94:04 - just point that.net all the way in the
94:06 - bottom and laugh
94:07 - and then just laugh because we're
94:08 - learning react js which is one of the
94:10 - most popular ones one of the best
94:12 - libraries out there i mean that is still
94:14 - not bad bro
94:15 - but but it's at the end so huh
94:27 - for those of you who are asking what is
94:28 - the difference between um react gs
94:31 - and angular it's pretty much just syntax
94:33 - it's right just an angular 7
94:35 - syntax react just is a la is a library
94:37 - so it's actually a lot faster
94:39 - um a lot faster and it's more low level
94:43 - i would say
94:44 - well angular is a framework so it's more
94:46 - high level and it's a little bit slower
94:48 - so there's more
94:48 - more things you need to do on the
94:50 - angular side you know when you're
94:51 - building angular applications okay
94:53 - so that's kind of the difference between
94:54 - that and so forth so cool downloads per
94:56 - year look at this guys
94:58 - react just increasing it's just going
95:01 - [Music]
95:06 - okay
95:07 - [Laughter]
95:09 - that wasn't planned there was no plan at
95:11 - all guys or just that in sync yeah
95:14 - yeah so angular right here as you can
95:16 - see angular right here
95:17 - right it's kind of like it's pretty good
95:18 - right it kind of it went up
95:20 - but it's kind of very still right now
95:22 - and of course
95:24 - of course uh we have things like view
95:27 - which was right here which is pretty
95:28 - pretty going pretty fast as well
95:29 - so and this stuff right let's see what
95:31 - do we have
95:32 - well there's a clear winner is there not
95:34 - i think there's a clear winner guy
95:36 - what do you think is i want to drop in
95:37 - the comments below who do you think wins
95:45 - you want to see who you guys think is
95:47 - going to win yes
95:49 - who do you think will win guys huh
95:53 - what do you think tell me let's dance
95:55 - like this
95:58 - dude i love this guy's shoulder movement
96:00 - man
96:04 - everyone's saying react are we coming to
96:06 - a con yeah let's go
96:08 - yes yes yes yes so in our case yes
96:12 - it is react for the win let's go
96:18 - there we go there we go guys everybody
96:20 - say react react let's go let's go
96:22 - awesome again all are amazing but we're
96:25 - going to choose one and continue on with
96:26 - that one okay
96:27 - exactly okay so in our case guys as you
96:30 - as you know in the next five days or so
96:32 - we're going to be building a slack clone
96:34 - right
96:34 - in our case here's kind of like halluci
96:37 - so this is kind of an introduction to
96:38 - how a slack clone looks
96:39 - it's pretty and pretty pretty pretty
96:41 - cool um you can sign in with google so
96:43 - you actually have the chance to sign in
96:44 - with google look at this i can do sign
96:45 - in with google
96:47 - click on here i can after that let me go
96:49 - and wait for a second
96:51 - signing with google uh slow wifi guys
96:55 - [Music]
96:58 - that's not bad actually that was good
97:00 - that's not that sorry
97:02 - that's like email no here right there
97:06 - cool it's like your email look at this
97:07 - by the way look at this you
97:09 - are in slack long and i can actually
97:10 - type this stuff right here for example
97:12 - here i can type i can say
97:13 - yo
97:17 - yo look kazi was having a conversation
97:19 - by himself
97:20 - with himself yeah and you can actually
97:21 - have more people on this slack channel
97:23 - look at this we have
97:24 - a channel here correct just challenge
97:26 - and we can have multiple channels as
97:28 - well so let's say we had a new channel
97:29 - called
97:29 - what channel should we add uh
97:33 - well we already did the challenge let's
97:34 - cp is the best
97:36 - sp never programmer so we can add
97:41 - our own for example look at this cloud
97:42 - program is now our channel
97:44 - and now in this channel we can now be
97:45 - talking so say yo
97:47 - cp fam right so and you guys at the end
97:50 - of this
97:51 - call at the end of this call but the end
97:52 - of this challenge will be able to
97:54 - have this slack for yourself and
97:58 - be able to have other people join it and
98:00 - you can be
98:01 - talking live with them that is so
98:02 - powerful just how we are live with you
98:04 - right now
98:05 - right through youtube you'll be live
98:07 - with them
98:08 - chatting just like how you are on
98:09 - messages or whatsapp or
98:12 - what other messaging tool you use this
98:14 - is the cool part about how pumped
98:16 - are you you're going to build this slack
98:19 - loan
98:20 - let us know in the comments below guys
98:23 - how pumped are you to build this
98:25 - because we're pretty much pretty much
98:28 - pretty pumped i mean we're i
98:29 - mean we're pretty excited man we're
98:31 - hyped
98:31 - we're high we're hype so if you're
98:33 - possible let us know in the comments
98:34 - below come on
98:41 - cp let's go people are pumped it up
98:45 - people are pumped tony is pumped up i
98:46 - can see right there
98:48 - tony's pumped up let's go to five
98:50 - seconds let's go
98:51 - holy that's crazy to the extreme
98:55 - pumped up that's what i'm talking about
98:57 - let's go
98:59 - okay cool guys so let's move on
99:02 - this is what you get to build now here
99:03 - are the tools you get to learn guys
99:05 - as we build this stuff all right let's
99:07 - go and go back to here
99:10 - okay so you get to use you you get to
99:12 - use firebase what is firebase and why is
99:14 - it so
99:15 - important for first development you tell
99:16 - me well firebase is what's going to
99:19 - allow us to have the data
99:22 - in the back because as you saw in the
99:23 - live chat it's getting the actual
99:26 - history of the chat from somewhere right
99:27 - correct so
99:28 - for example you see how i'm putting the
99:30 - data here what do you think this is
99:31 - being saved guys
99:32 - this is being saved in firebase right in
99:36 - firebase
99:36 - this data right as i type something into
99:39 - input
99:40 - this goes like let's let's think about
99:41 - this okay so we have
99:43 - let me go ahead and put this for you
99:44 - somewhat on we say firebase here
99:46 - okay let's do uh let's do brush tool
99:50 - so let's say this is five this is our
99:51 - database okay you type here it goes to
99:54 - firebase
99:55 - and firebase actually updates what we
99:57 - have here
99:58 - and when you reload when you reload your
100:00 - page it actually comes from firebase
100:02 - and that's how we see this same thing
100:03 - here it goes with the cloud this
100:05 - channels right here right
100:06 - this stuff comes from firebase you see
100:08 - what i mean
100:09 - yeah that's how it works that's powerful
100:11 - right and the firebase auto
100:13 - loads that's the cool part about
100:14 - firebase it auto loads
100:16 - um live no not a lot
100:20 - out of shows out of lowes what is this
100:22 - uh auto shows
100:25 - live messaging basically allows us to do
100:27 - live master that's the really cool part
100:29 - about
100:29 - firebase okay okay next up if we go
100:32 - ahead
100:33 - let's go ahead keep going i guess that's
100:35 - the way we're going to use tool okay
100:37 - next up so boom it's easy as that bro uh
100:40 - that's insane let's go ahead and keep
100:41 - going
100:42 - it's free oh yeah did i mention this for
100:44 - you guys it's freaking easy to use
100:46 - yes oh something is a real time thank
100:48 - you so much oh my god
100:51 - finally i was looking for that it's real
100:53 - time firebase is real time
100:55 - yeah sometimes i can't read naz's brain
100:57 - i know come on bro we gotta stay on top
100:59 - of this yeah i gotta step back i'm sorry
101:01 - guys
101:01 - and i guess and also not only will
101:03 - firebase be the one to do real-time
101:05 - data by the fibers will also
101:09 - also be hosting our application so in
101:11 - the end of our
101:12 - slack clone we finish this we're going
101:14 - to finish the cycle on day
101:16 - one two four on four right you will host
101:19 - your
101:20 - your your app on something called
101:22 - firebase hosting
101:23 - and you will have a live to share and
101:25 - not to share with your friends with your
101:27 - family like yo

106:44 - of 15k boot 15k bootcamp full-size
106:46 - mastery price so that's pretty sick
106:48 - okay cool so here how to learn a code
106:51 - believe you're a limb list that's part
106:52 - one
106:53 - growth mindset think you need to believe
106:55 - in yourself and to believe that
106:57 - there is more to you than right now
106:59 - right that the fact that
107:01 - there is more opportunities there are
107:02 - more possibilities a lot of people
107:04 - unfortunately are stuck in a mindset
107:05 - they're stuck and believing the fact
107:07 - that they can't do
107:08 - it right i guess again guys we're going
107:10 - to come to a close now at this point
107:11 - right daily habits i'm coding code
107:14 - daily daily daily abc right
107:18 - always be coding yes yes oh thank you
107:20 - always be coding right
107:22 - one hour 30 minutes at least something
107:25 - that is how you when you build you put
107:27 - those hours that is how you get the
107:29 - results you want yes
107:30 - right if you do it once a month that's
107:32 - not going to take you anything
107:33 - i've had students like that i'm sorry
107:35 - they're not gonna go anywhere
107:36 - right if you don't do that cool awesome
107:39 - how to learn to code
107:40 - well um why can't i not solve this
107:43 - so you can be either you could be like
107:45 - this angry guy here
107:46 - yeah it could be like this cool i mean
107:48 - essentially what this breaks down to is
107:49 - you can take on two different mindsets
107:51 - you could take on the problem-centric
107:53 - mindset or problem-oriented mindset like
107:55 - this guy over here
107:56 - he's got a problem he's mad about the
107:58 - problem can you show the slide real
107:59 - quick oh thank you he's mad about the
108:00 - problem so
108:01 - he hits his computer with this keyboard
108:03 - because he's focused so much on the
108:04 - problem or
108:06 - you could become solution oriented where
108:08 - you try to figure out like you see the
108:09 - problem and try to figure out the
108:10 - solution
108:11 - to fix that specific problem exactly so
108:14 - you could be either here or here
108:15 - right your mind should always be how can
108:18 - i solve this
108:19 - nah and not oh i'm stuck or i can't do
108:23 - it it should be always
108:24 - how can i do it now i not i can't do it
108:28 - there's a saying that says if i can't
108:31 - then i must and if i must then i can
108:38 - read that study that put it into your
108:41 - brain
108:41 - tattoo it if you have to because exactly

127:02 - worry we'll get you we got you don't
127:04 - worry
127:05 - okay how about i start the same motivate
127:07 - motivate the code
127:08 - because after participating so much i
127:10 - fall out and lose interest it's pretty
127:12 - guys so number one it's pressure it's
127:15 - actually pressure on yourself don't put
127:16 - so much pressure yourself
127:17 - find a way to enjoy coding right so
127:20 - actually just have fun with it
127:21 - a lot of people pressure themselves
127:23 - thinking that if they can't do something
127:24 - they can't solve it
127:26 - that's it it's not meant for them
127:29 - but that's not the reality of things no
127:32 - i mean even then it's all like
127:33 - a lot of things that you try to do
127:35 - whether it's coding or anything else
127:36 - there's gonna be
127:37 - a lot of challenges there's gonna be a
127:39 - lot of obstacles there's gonna be a lot
127:40 - of
127:40 - failure but you have to stick with so
127:43 - very often
127:44 - instead of trying to ask yourself how do
127:45 - you stay motivated try to ask yourself
127:47 - how can you stay disciplined
127:48 - because motivation is gonna be up and
127:50 - down depending on the day
127:52 - but discipline can be there for you day
127:54 - after day after day so if you
127:56 - switch that question and you see the
127:58 - habits that you have to build
127:59 - that's going to help you to keep on
128:00 - moving forward even when it gets tough
128:02 - yes yes yes of course of course and of
128:04 - course guys very important i want to say

128:36 - awesome next next up let's see
128:38 - who let's go love team cp let's go
128:42 - amazing love it love it love it
128:46 - okay any thoughts on data science oh hi
128:48 - i'm rice i'm exploring many different
128:50 - programming um let's see career options
128:54 - any thoughts on a data science field
128:56 - you guys are great by the way thank you
128:57 - so much so uh
128:59 - data science is amazing i mean what's
129:01 - your take on i've been talking a lot
129:02 - what's your take on it
129:04 - nice save naz so here's my take on data
129:08 - science right
129:09 - is in programming there's gonna be so
129:11 - many different fields there's gonna be
129:13 - so many new shiny objects
129:14 - so i think it's gonna come back to what
129:16 - i said in this live before which
129:18 - is you have to be self-aware if you
129:20 - personally
129:21 - like developing web applications and you
129:24 - want to become a web developer then go
129:26 - for that path
129:27 - if you like to go more towards the route
129:29 - of being able to get a lot of data
129:31 - put it in a way that people can see it
129:33 - data analytics data science
129:34 - data analysis all those things then it
129:37 - might be something worth
129:38 - exploring but in the end there's no
129:40 - perfect path just choose something
129:42 - that's congruent with you
129:43 - and that you will like i agree with that
129:47 - try data science data science is uh is
129:49 - an important
129:50 - field that's going very fast may that be
129:53 - with javascript or python
129:55 - um you know i built my first machine
129:57 - learning algorithm using
129:59 - from a free course that i did which has
130:01 - been amazing and that actually is what
130:03 - got me
130:03 - an internship that's that was awesome as
130:05 - well um
130:07 - so there's a lot of opportunities to
130:08 - grow there and it's also really fun like
130:10 - right i mean think about a tesla for
130:12 - example right like how do you think
130:14 - their cars can do alipa like i test i
130:16 - drove my the tesla yesterday
130:18 - and it's crazy like bro it just drives
130:19 - by itself yeah like
130:21 - it was just there and the wheels like
130:23 - turning by itself just turning like
130:24 - whoa what's going on but it did that
130:27 - because it had a lot of data
130:28 - yeah all this data is coming in and the
130:30 - the the vehicle is figuring out
130:32 - what it has to do next yeah super
130:34 - important
130:35 - but see if you really like it give it a
130:37 - try if you don't like it it's all fine
130:39 - you can yeah
130:40 - yeah but you know as you're doing data
130:42 - science no matter which field you start
130:43 - out with the cool part is
130:45 - you will build the problem-solving mind
130:46 - so if you let's say
130:48 - you try to design so you didn't like it
130:50 - you can very easily transfer out to
130:52 - full-size development or front-end or
130:53 - back-end
130:54 - so easily because you already have the
130:56 - problem solving mind of a developer
130:58 - and that's why it's important to know
131:00 - and understand the fundamentals because
131:02 - the fundamentals you can translate
131:04 - from different fields to different
131:06 - languages yes
131:07 - so portfolio guys please hear me out
131:10 - portfolio link is going to be

134:46 - good vibes always always good vibes no

134:51 - you think it's bad to explore many
134:52 - programming languages let me see
134:54 - angelo asked do you think it's bad
134:58 - hold on to explore many programming
135:00 - languages and not specialize in one
135:03 - uh no it's not bad honestly the more you
135:06 - learn
135:07 - that the better right as you get better
135:09 - in one language then you say go to
135:10 - another language get better than
135:11 - language that will actually improve
135:13 - your ability in a different language yes
135:16 - i will say however before you try to
135:18 - explore these languages
135:19 - really master one really get one down
135:22 - and understand it
135:23 - because if you just try to learn all
135:25 - these different languages at the same
135:26 - time
135:27 - you're gonna get really confused and
135:28 - you're not gonna learn a lot of things
135:30 - so
135:30 - secret one in the beginning get really
135:32 - good at it master it
135:34 - and then later you can go out and

start with the challenge just like this one so how can you also do the same how can you also start to take that path and go down you know the same path they did to have that kickstart in their career yeah so let's go take a look at this right so how can i do it that's what we're going to be showing you in this challenge okay all right so here's what we're going to be building in this challenge that's part one look at this amazing clone let's go so not only will you get a chance to learn react gs and javascript in general you will build your first project which is a slack clone like whose first project is a slack clone bro not many slack they usually they put down like a small todo list which is like oh papa look how cool it is but it's shitty you know yeah so like to be able to build a slack but here's the thing in this lag clone we'll get to use technologies do we have to know just somewhere there no look at this in this clock we'll get new technologies like crazy look at this let me check this out for you so you have it here guys and kind of screenshot this guys for yourself okay so we get to use stuff like for example i mean of course react.js you guys know this at this point right we get to use for example style components which is insane style components right we'll get to use things like for example uh firebase right for data right and the cool thing this is again this is for data purposes let me go ahead and for data purposes this is how we're going to save data right so if i go ahead for example if i point to it for you let me go and point it this data data is what kind of shows up this right here you see how says jesse right here for example jesse one of our amazing uh teachers right she's actually in the comments guys make sure to shout out to her and david of course as well and i'm on just the whole team i'll introduce the whole team here in a second but again stock components is kind of how we're going to style this stuff right here eric gs in general that's the whole application okay on top of that we'll use you get to learn stuff like okay what are for example like components right so components is kind of the building blocks of react.js in general you'll get to learn things for example how to how to go ahead and well i mean we talk about style style style components but how to com how to actually build a live live chat app right because this stuff right here like yes it's cool but this stuff right here let me show you this stuff is actually live so for example you know when you go to whatsapp when you go to whatsapp or maybe messages and you know you're texting someone and it kind of shows up live kind of as you're doing it that's what we're going to do so these messages as you type in here will show up live and other people will be able to kind of come in and also you will see their messages how sick is that man you're telling me if someone does this clone yes they're going to have the opportunity to learn all the things that they need to learn about react but not only that they're going to learn some backend stuff as well because i mean maybe full stack developers yeah you're basically i mean you you basically are learning kind of the front end aspect which is what you see here on the front right here but also how the data side is stored right so that data b data b no that should be a nickname for database oh database um so yeah right of course that that's you're going to learn the data part of it which is the back end and that kind of gets you towards right becoming a what a full stack developer right that should be a goal for everybody right when you can know the front end and you can know the back end how when you have when you know two sides of the coin guys you're very very powerful you're like you're like thanos got this rock i've got all the powers in all my knuckles you know you got all the powers that's what you are but let's not compare things but anyways you do you do have all the powers right so not only does that give you more opportunities but i give you so much more so right as we said guys react gs right you get to learn you know components right style components you'll get to learn for example things like like react router right react router router how to go ahead and make api calls right things like that like api calls right and so so so so much more continues on

part is we're enjoying this so show time let's go you ready oh oh my god this is so good we enjoyed this so much guys this is why we have so much fun so we just get to code and have fun and show you guys how to do it guys so we're super happy to be here so the question is how many of you want to become a react js developer leave that in the comments below i want to see those right now guys so many oh george is like show time let's go ah so many amazing people 7 19 likes oh beautiful let's go george says showtime amazing you guys are too happy guys you guys it's just gonna be so so good guys whoo let's go and say oh yeah let's go how do i go ahead and show this ah there we go cool beautiful all right next up so starting starting your journey as a regular developer okay let's get serious take out your pens take out your notepads whatever you got to do take them out just put it on the table and then slap them on there and then just take your notes yeah let's go so we'll go deep into building your personal world map for making 100k per year as a javascript developer on day three of our live training yes okay but for now let's figure out your opportunities to become a developer in 2021 there's actually well that this is actually going to be day five guys this day day five there shouldn't be day three that should be day five right here don't worry so on the last day we'll talk about the opportunity like the road map how the roadmap how to become you know how to make a hundred key per year so the more but that's gonna be day five guys but for now it's gonna figure out your opportunities to become a developer and why you're even here and why you should just learn react just in general okay so to get started it all starts with habits so what are some habits they need to learn daniel tell me well they're right in front of us but one of them is you want to make sure you're doing this because you love it you're having fun and it's enjoyable for you because the one thing you want to make sure you don't do programming for is learning how to become a developer is for the money money yes money is good as developer yes but it's not what's going to take you to the next level you have to be able to enjoy what you do guys that's the most important part it can be the first initiative because maybe like you're stuck in the career you don't want to do but you really need to enjoy something like coding because it's just not easy coding is just not easy in general it's hard right it's not easy it's going to take a lot of hard work a lot of patience and so what else do you think they need well you just said them they should develop a habit of hard work and have patience as well right yeah there you go patience what else should they develop you need to learn how to cooperate with other people and a team so that both of you guys or the whole team has not said can move a mountain and not just the hill yes i can this is a very important part this is what something a lot of people miss and we'll talk a little bit about that on day five as well right how do you cooperate more with the team because like we even spoke with a google recruiter and they said that team corporation and you know your eq is one of the biggest things they look for when they when they go and hire someone so like that to me is like really interesting right because if you can work the team nobody wants to work with an no matter what job you're at uh if he was an i would not want to work with him right like you know just that's just the case can you make that focus please can you press the button this one yeah press the button thank you so much okay awesome cool guys so you see that's the goal communication very important guys communicate what you're doing right learning always be learning as developer you always have to start staying on top of the things you know learning new technologies and so forth and of course take initiative right here is don't just wait for people to tell you things that just a good goal in general for life right don't just wait for people to to give you to tell to tell you what to do just do it just do it i always tell that to everybody may that be maybe they are being the full stack mastery coding boot camp or are they in pwj doesn't matter take initiative so make sure you write that that part down okay cool all right next up so comment below what can making money as a javascript developer help you achieve in your life tell me go ahead down below are you looking for financial freedom like why are you looking forward to support your family correct are they looking for because have more time to spend with your loved ones is that the reason why you want to become a react javascript developer and to touch on nasa's point the reason you want to ask these difficult questions is because you want to dig deep and figure out your why because nasa said this isn't an easy journey it's going to take hard work it's going to take patience so that why of yours needs to be strong and it needs to be your anchor it needs to have a big purpose for you yes a lot of people are saying financial freedom let me go and take a look at this a lot of people saying financial freedom people are saying all of them some people are saying i'm looking for a new job right some people are saying jesse jesse the bomb let's go support my family that's amazing it's amazing guys yeah so it's all amazing stuff right all of them college money support financial freedom natural freedom is a big one i would say so for sure right being able to you know work from anywhere you want right and not be not being like stuck up into the either you know is either in uh you know uh working from for minimum wage or anything like that and just enjoying what you do i would say so you know i know i'll actually put another bracket on here you know what is the reason i'd actually put another bracket which is like you know what maybe just you want to enjoy what you do enjoy what you do i think it's another aspect yeah for sure enjoy what you do yeah i mean imagine if you could show up to work every day passionate about what you're doing right even if you're working for someone else that's totally fine if you're passionate about it if you're enjoying what you're doing i think that's a life worth living because you're actually living it's not like for us for example here guys like the reason why we can do so many calls like some of the live calls because we enjoy this stuff like we love getting the chance to interact with you guys you love getting the chance to just be with you right that's why because we love what we do cool so that's why okay let's figure out your income goals okay how much income do you want to make per month as a react just drop in the comments below you're thinking about 50k but also be reasonable don't say like a thousand million hundred thousand million one trillion dollars 500 million dollars no please be reasonable okay and this question is important guys because again as it is very realistic you now know what you can start to work with once you set that goal you can reverse engineer that goal and figure out the action steps that you have to set to be able to hit that goal so comment down below your specific goal and what that looks like for you exactly and let's go ahead guys and also at the same time while you're doing that make sure to hit the like button right now hit the like button right now help us with this youtube algorithm because youtube algorithm sometimes can be a little bit of a little bit of hassle no we have to defeat the youtube algorithm because we cannot let it beat us no let's not beat those dudes guys our goal in this youtube live call and facebook live call is to get two 1k likes so let's go ahead and get to that as soon as possible because then you know what and then just keep somebody said one billion dollars holy come on guys i'm saying 20k dollars that's that 20k above 70k that's that's pretty doable i would say so yeah 150k that's pretty good copy right here as well 7k you guys can even do more than 7k i would say so as well i think that might be the per month yeah yeah yeah so 7k per month 100k that's pretty good too 100k is good so yeah some great numbers i like that okay now do you want to freelance or full time okay let's think about this right so as a freelancer right what are some benefits you get as a freelancer think about this what do you think daniel well one of the first ones i thought was remote work but sometimes that is applicable to fulltime as well but i think that's still something that people like right yeah remote work and you can maybe work around on your own schedule promote work from anywhere anywhere so you want to look at bali you can work on bali right oh man but especially right now during colby guys you have the opportunity to work remotely even if you have a fulltime job as well so don't just limit yourself to freelance you can do both if you wanted to or you can try one and try another one right so don't just limit yourself also for example this again remote work can be here right my work can be here work from anywhere right that's kind of the goal autumn next freelance what else do you what else do you think is a benefit from freelancing no man i think you kind of choose your own hours you don't necessarily have to work the court hours all the time right yeah yes choose your own up sorry oh my gosh i'm dying choo choo hours that's great because here again the full time you kind of have to do like a nine to five a lot of times right which is for some people it's fine right that doesn't you know for some people it's like you know no problem whatsoever as long as i love what i do and i'm making good money that's all that matters right so that's fine what else what do you think so i mean this could be a pro or a con but as a freelancer you're gonna have to be in charge of yourself so you're gonna do like your own marketing you're gonna have to find your own clients all those things right yeah so that could be a pro or con right if you want to do that if you want to go to those events to network with people to find your clients and it's a pro if you don't want to do that then it might be more of a con but you are in charge of your success specifically as a freelancer exactly so that's and yeah and sometimes it's good sometimes it's bad because if you can't be in charge yourself you can't be disciplined so that's what you have to be you have to be disciplined right so be disciplined yes and i'm sorry and if you can't be disciplined you cannot be a freelancer i'm sorry that's just that's just facts exactly if you can't get up for example if you can't hey because you have to you're the one getting clients you're the one who has to client management and project management right and sales that kind of stuff if you can't do that if you cannot be disciplined around that i'm sorry i think maybe full time would better for you right exactly but of course try it out and see how you how you work exactly exactly we're not here to tell you go one way or the other we're here to just give you the truth of both so that you can decide for yourself because either is perfectly fine you just want to make sure you're doing it for the right reasons yeah but you also yeah and with full time yes work is selected for you so you're not so much in charge of yourself but you do also but you also do have do have the option to select projects right to select your project right yeah so there's really nothing bad about full time i have done full time all a lot of a big part of my career i do also the freelancing and i'm also doing this right now so it's it's crazy right but also or do you have the and there's a full time there's nothing really bad you have to opt to select your own project no problem whatsoever yeah right at all adults so it's pretty good too all right awesome next up freelance what else do you think freelancing what i would say is one pro is select your own project amazing right right because if you have clients coming to you you could tell if you there's a project you're not passionate about you're not excited about you could say hey like refer them to someone else point them in another direction exactly i can get the help elsewhere and then the ones that you're excited about you're like i want to work on this exactly you can do that exactly and the cool thing is like you get to wear hats like it could be pro or con wear many many hats now i'm not actually saying like actual many hats like i don't have any hat right now but i want to wear five hats but i'm saying guys a hat see i'm trying to look but i mean like hats were like you get to be sales and project management and client management so you actually get to learn a lot as a freelancer at the same time too right and so and also one other thing i would say is you know your income income there's really no limit right but also getting to a higher limit to get into a higher income is also pretty hard so yeah right but i think the important thing is there it's flexibility yes the reality is yes you can work maybe even just 20 hours and still make the 70 000 a year if you pick the right projects and you buy yourself those 20 hours a week instead of having to work to 40 hours a week right exactly you have that flexibility to choose whether you want to go really hard and go as hard as you can to make as much money or pull back so you have more time to spend with family to support your family to spend with friends whatever that is for you traveling whatever that is exactly so that's that's the really cool part about is the flexibility right is you've been able to work from anywhere you want and go anywhere so like if you want to stop working just stop working you know i mean of course not making money but still you know but i think the cool part here is the opportunity here um to learn is also on the full time is also pretty great so to learn right opportunity to learn because sometimes you're going to be put in a position where you're going to have amazing coworkers who are also smart and knowledgeable who you can talk to and leverage and learn from them so you can accelerate your learning process as well yeah mentorship right because as a freelancer you're kind of on your own that's that's the issue right you're very much on your own and you don't have any people to bounce off ideas from right you know and so that kind of can leave you feeling like oh i can't do this but when you're in a fulltime job you know you're pretty much you're you're there with people and that's that's always amazing right oh i'm very i'm very extroverted actually i'm intro to slash extroverted but i love i know he's extroverted trust me i was introverted when i was in high school i was introverted like as trust me um so cool awesome so that's kind of that's gonna full time and let us know in the comments below from what you just seen right now guys that's in the comments below what do you think like which part are you are you freelance yeah or do you see some fulltime or maybe you see yourself both yes no you can actually do both right because you can have a fulltime job and on the side pick up freelancing projects you're passionate about so there's nothing wrong with doing one or the other or both and again we're just here to kind of educate you guys on the different opportunities so that you could choose for yourself what's the best decision yeah exactly a lot of people saying full time a lot of people saying see both both amazing yeah we all a lot of people are saying both oh full time maybe on the future will will change both but a lot of both hassan says both that's amazing and also guys the cool thing is none of them are permanent like at any time you can go full time and if the move is right you could go over to freelancing yeah but you can also start as a freelancer and whenever time is right you can go over to full time so it's just cool because it's so flexible but again the thing is you have to be aware of your goals which is what we're going to be diving into exactly next right so let's talk about that next right now guys okay so make sure you guys screenshot this portion squish of this portion if you have to so remember this okay it's gonna and you can maybe share it later on discord and anywhere else and again again guys for those of you right hold on let me go those of you who who are not in the javascript challenge again this is exclusive a lot of stuff that are happening in discord we have a discord community you have a facebook community right if you're watching on youtube and you're not part of those make sure to join them react.js challenges down below that's the only way that you will get the chance to win the 15k dollar boot camp i guess get a chance to be selected for that so make sure you join link is on the description join that specific uh amazing group right there awesome let's go and keep going guys we are currently at 815 likes come on let's get to 900 likes come on let's go how you always put the music bro appreciate your sound all right all right so 805 likes come on guys we get to 850 likes what all right guys so take that screenshot guys take that screenshot we're having fun because next we are going to make this super simple for your journey because it all starts with one thing and what is that one time that is actually a longterm goal right write down the longterm goal what is your goal your goal is it to become you want to go ahead and become a foster developer right if it's a focus developer that's amazing right that's one two years you could be looking one to five years potentially six or seven months if you join our full stack mastery coding bootcamp yeah exactly so but here's the point guys like when you do this even if you think one to five years if you're able to have that career transition and become that developer and get that dream job this is something you could do for the next 20 to 30 to 40 years of your life but it's just gonna take that one to five years or six months if you go to full stack mastery boot camp to be able to have that transition but you wanna think long term what do you wanna be doing five years from now ten years exactly exactly right so make sure write this stuff down because as you write down you remember that's how it gets into your brain right but again you look at this as the career this is not just a shortterm thing you just try it out and you quit no this is a longterm thing right you learn you put in time because you know what this is saying that says nothing worth having comes easy okay so if you're going to be doing this for the rest of your life put in the time put in the work right and you will get the results that you want right daniel here worked on amazon well i mean he worked that out blue orange amazon company anyways no it is but it is no it's a different company but jeff bezos is demanding it's the same company bro anyways so you got the longterm goal it's awesome let's go let's place up into now shortterm goals okay now our shortterm goals for example could be to learn javascript fundamentals in a month that's gonna be maybe your part one okay what i mean by fundamentals it's the first part so so let's go ahead and take a look at those right so if i go ahead and look at this write this stuff down write your journey down create a timeline for yourself and make a plan right when you make a plan that is when you go ahead and actually get results now when i when i say learn javascript okay here are the things you want to learn okay so let's think about this okay part one you want to learn for example fundamentals of coding right so you want to get that you want to get a go ahead and get your uh let me see your problem solving mind right that's fundamentals of javascript okay javascript slash react gs okay actually let's go javascript first and then we'll do two for example you know it's going to be for example react.js okay right then once you learn the mentos maybe you want to get into more so okay let's go ahead and build more projects so third part three is gonna be for example build projects okay now of course during all this time you're still building building projects guys all right the whole time why are you doing fundamentals so while you are learning javascript while you learn regress you are doing fundamentals always and building projects always and i mean always forever and ever and ever forever ever right part three maybe you go ahead and you get into more of the back inside right so that might be for example node.js who knows right something we actually teach in profit javascript amazing stuff right there cool so node.js and then you maybe you maybe you build uh once you learn js you build more your full stack project so five build go ahead and say build full stack project right that's going to be what you do and then finally six that's when you go ahead and you start interviewing so start interviewing right so look at this at this point on step six you're already interviewing with companies how sick is that okay huge that's pretty pretty huge guys but of course you know you can't rush this stuff yes these steps are simple but i didn't say they were easy they were not easy okay you have to put the time you have to put in the work okay so when you're doing this kind of stuff right guys fundamentals that's going to take you some time maybe a month maybe or two react gs together with the fundamentals again going to take you maybe a month right in this course in our course right now you'll get the chance to learn some fundamentals to even kickstart right away your react gs knowledge okay so right there take this as a as an amazing opportunity for you to learn to kickstart your career this is why we say that this challenge this pride challenge covers pretty much the goodness all the stuff covers all this stuff and this stuff like so this challenge gets you to step five already step five like step five like what the what the heck days you're gonna you know step five exactly how amazing is that it's pretty insane i would say that cool and of course you have and let's go ahead and talk about the opportunities for react gs developers pretty simple guys so how big is this opportunity right when you become a react.js developer what is insight for you what can you actually do what can you actually achieve good question i know i ask good questions that's why i'm here i know so what do we what do we tell them i think we should uh tell them about the opportunities that are out there in the world right we actually went and took screenshots of specific opportunities as a full stack developer as a react.js developer front and back and everything look at this so guys a hundred and five k oh let me kind of move this pick that up 100 105k for a full stack developer seller that's average guys per year right average right that's insane of course it depends on where you are at if you're in california this might be more of course if you're somewhere else might be less this is the average okay next up for example for the front developer 77k per year now this is average numbers you can make it a lot more if you're really good at what you do right if you're really passionate about this okay passion always makes you earn more always i don't give a sh i'm trying to i'm trying not to swear because i think youtube brings us down when we swear oh that's it i think so but it doesn't does not freaking matter i need to have a little bleepy thing but yeah so cool and then also back in developer makes around 100 101k guys so based on this guys in the comments drop it below who's excited to become a front end a backhand or a full stack developer let us know in the comments below let's go and take a look at this and also we are at 875 likes wow let's get bro 1000 what's the goal this this one's 1 000 let's get to 900 right now guys 900. click right now and then move on right now 900 likes you should keep still you guys got this come on come on 900 likes guys come on 8.78 878 come on 880 878 880 come on let's get to 900. can we get 900 right now are we really going to wait till we get to 900 i'm i'm waiting we're waiting guys get us to 900 baby 89 what else andy four 8.99 patient how much fun is this bro is too much this is how much fun you should have when you're coding this is too good so so many people are pumped right yeah so for example we have ashley where is the where was this guy so many comments i can't even keep up with everybody holy 119 likes you guys are insane thank you so much guys whoo the drop killed it bro your dance is awesome there we go they're probably talking about danielle right now let's go more music david says amazing are you wait who said that where where the coolest developers they've ever seen you know aisha good amazing to see you so much thank you so much i appreciate you guys 9 24 whoo can we get to one okay oh chill now we just got to 900. all right let's go a little bit okay okay i'm just too excited sorry all right what does it look like you come down a little bit hold on don't worry i got my water all right i'm the coffee nozzle i'm also going to make it make sure you get some water guys very important for your for your advice so as a foster developer guys which is what you're going to learn in this challenge right now again if you're not in a challenge what are you doing link in the description below but and this right you have to write from developer you have to know how to become a backend developer right that doesn't includes for example you know i'm backing again we'll explain what a backend is back in if you don't know exactly what a backend it's like imagine you log into facebook right you log into facebook right you put in your password on the back inside is where it checks your password and actually goes ahead sorry and it actually goes ahead and validates that you're a real person right that's the backing the front end is what you see on the front it's a very simple structure right database is all your data for example let's say facebook right data about you as a person it is saved where it's saving database so facebook has no database devops this is the stuff where like for example the server right so this stuff is where for example how do you think you can access facebook right that's because facebook is on a server this is called devops right now you don't have to learn this specifically to become a photo developer this is helpful right here and it's very nice and then finally you actually get you can actually be able to put the mobile app so with react.js which is what you're learning right now the igs allows you not only to build front end and the front applications but it also allows you to build guys mobile apps how cool is that that is absolutely amazing it's insane it's so crazy it's i'm so excited one library one framework can allow you to do all these different things so much so much so what does the front end look like we should dive into those specific details so first things that you have to learn right so that's html right that's css again i know these icons look weird but html css right then javascript right here okay then for example we have react gs right here okay this we have yet guys in this specific portion you're learning but that's not it guys you also get to learn this too so you get to learn all aspects of front end right and even back because this right here is not just from this right here is also backend what's this called it's called firebase firearms go type this up guys if you're not sure what what that is guys i'll just give you a chance to go ahead and look it up by yourself this is called firebase okay pretty cool tool you'll get a chance to learn uh that's a vr database for us so again this is beginner friendly so if you don't know what any of these things are we'll break it down real quick so html is the structure of a web page very much like the skeleton of this little deadpool lego right yeah so so kind of like you know how you know how daniel looks like right now you see his face right now right now this is him right now right this is html right this is how he looks right he's got the beer and everything right that's that's html okay the css so i guess you can say that better says yes yes so css is how you make a website look beautiful and pretty and aesthetic right so to the structure we added this awesome red color we had the gun we added the sword we added deadpool and finally javascript is what makes a website fluid as well and it makes it function it makes it function just like how deadpool is dancing let's go let's go so like you see how daniel's dancing or me i'm dancing right so that's javascript right they're making us everything function right so everything for example you see on facebook focus you know and when you log into facebook that's javascript right being able to hit the login button and that transfers you over to another page that in my friends is javascript it's a very simple structure okay and you'll get to learn all of those in this challenge so if you're not in there what are you doing i don't even know i i can't question you anymore so html learn the basics make it page make it work don't ever complicate it right html is the you is the view i know sorry is the view it is what you see don't worry guys i got water so ishmael is what you see right html css it is the really really pretty stuff right learn how to use different layouts like flexbox response design media queries midi quiz for example is when you switch out for example from a bigger screen right a bigger screen to a smaller screen right or to mobile screen how does your site change as you do that that's the big question right how does your site change well it's pretty simple again it's using something called media queries okay all right let's keep going next up and finally javascript master the fundamentals guys data types something you need to learn hundred percent you know you need to learn things like for example let me take a look at this things like uh well stacks things like you know stacks and again do not over complicate yourself don't worry you don't need to learn this just right now not the most important thing but you will get to learn this later on as you get going into your career as a reactor as developer right stacks cues like lists so much more you have to learn things like functions like what's a function right like what is a function actually i'm curious a function is a piece of code that allows your software to actually perform something so very similar to how we saw deadpool dancing and he was given function he was giving life the function allows you to actually execute something and actually do something correct correct so that's what function function does it's kind of like its own little thing in in terms of execution just have a car has you know wheels right which function to drive the car your gas pedal is you know to to have you go fast right they have their own different functions we have the same thing in coding down manipulation that's basically being able to manipulate what you see on the front end right so when you have cool animations or even here for example here as i'm drawing right this is called dom manipulation right i'm manipulating the view it's as simple as that scope this scope is kind of like i won't get too technical away but scope is basically just where you can do what you can do so it's like because you can't do everything with everything exactly i know i don't keep this confusing to give it to you i know it's everything with everything and the fetch api is you being able to communicate with different resources online so facebook for example communicates with different resources it communicates with their server it communicates with all the different applications to be able to log you in and stuff like that okay comprende good so you might be asking why javascript well pretty simple i mean if you take a look at this here are some tab companies they use i mean linkedin right facebook microsoft ebay tesla groupon netflix google uber tinder airbnb people guys it goes on and on anything on the web uses javascript html css and react.js is like kind of the it's kind of the the how do i say this the topping on the top no the the what's it called the cherry on top the chicken yeah the cherry on top i don't know what are you trying to say i'm just trying to make you fancy man yes cherry on top react gs that's the cherry on top that makes everything work very nicely it makes it easier for us to work okay so that's that's the whole goal now guys let us know in the comments below who wants to work for any of these companies down below guys comment down below if you want to work for any of these companies come on and the crazy thing is if you master front end you can work for any of these companies because they all have those type of developer positions you can put yourself in a place where you know for those of you that said you want to do full time you can work for these companies you know yes yes yes see we have google someone said google is insane okay awesome somebody said i sent microsoft let's say microsoft i do there we go tesla oh let's go tesla let's go tesla i'm not not just specifically excited about that one yeah i'm very excited about one tesla would be great yes i actually myself just got a tesla recently so that's why we're excited about that so let's go for tesla google amazing amazing i do tesla see tesla's big look at this bro dude you made the right choice yeah man i mean tesla's crushing man awesome we can just keep going at this point guys we are at 973 likes hold on before we move on 973 likes hold on what uh which one's the horn bro all right bro it's gotta be the last one so guys 973 likes let's get us to a thousand lives can we do that right now 970 likes again let's go and we are going to celebrate together with you and we'll move on really quickly right now come on 978 likes let's get to one click let's go let's go 978 980 bro 980 come on this is growing quick 1k 1k 91 let's go 91 guys can you get us a thousand let's go again let's just make this the best channel for coding out there period i mean it already is but help us make it even better guys exactly so let's go let's go one kid likes 9.91 9.95 9.95 are you ready for this bro we're 1 000 likes appreciate your sound needed for innovation oh my god guys i need you to know i only have one dance move and it's the same one all the time so it might start to get old by day five all right so cool move on let's get through so okay that's it 1k we already crossed okay now let's get to 2k okay so resources for front end free code cam part one frontend mentor amazing stuff right there right this is the stuff you can learn for example from free cocaine right um youtube of course so you as you guys know we have youtube and cleverprogrammer right so for example here we have amazing courses here completely for free for you html course on our course css course okay three of our course amazing stuff through here go ahead and check check them out it's okay it's fine so right check them out next up eight we have a javascript course completely free for you eight hour javascript course right here just type in cleverprogrammer javascript it's gonna be the first one to pop up it's just so damn good it's just so good so um yeah there you go you know it'll pop up the first one so make sure you check that one out too all right so what can you do with javascript good question is that right is that a good question that's an amazing question guys that's an amazing question because you're about to learn javascript you're about to learn react to yes what can you do with it well what can you tell me well you could definitely do some web apps because that just showed up on the slide so what's a web app a web app is a web application so we talked about full stack development where you have a nice ui you have a database in the back and it's actually able to do something functional right yes next oh you could do a native application so native application would be a specific application for mobile phones like an ios phone an android phone or microsoft phone still a thing i don't know no it's not sorry not microsoft on there yeah no no no so here for example here for example guys um actually native apps tesla app is actually built with react native just as well yep desk lab is fully built with react native tesla is actually built with react react gs native so you are learning here in reg.js not only for front end not only to build web apps right but you're also learning to build crazy like apps like tesla apps like that's insane right i use that app i use that app yeah it's a pretty good app man if only tesla cars were built with react js that'd be epic okay that's interesting and the server apps of course node.js right here so server apps are backing applications and that also use javascript okay cool next up so how to make money in javascript that's a good question okay well think about this guys how to make money how do you want to make money as a javascript developer again pretty simple stuff here not easy right no simple but not easy of course so i love this guys give a shout out to friends show i love them so much i'm the teacher so one of the ways in which you can do it guys is actually through teaching and coaching so the really cool part about this is why what's the cool part about this daniel well what's cool is you don't need to be super masterful to be able to teach and coach you just need to be two to three steps ahead of the person you're coaching and teaching because you already learned those things and you can offer value to them yeah in that situation you don't need to be a pro right you don't need to be a professional five years of experience you have experience you literally just need a couple months no or even then just like you just need to know the next two steps exactly the thing is we'll talk a little about that later on in a second here but that's the cool part about coding is that you can teach anybody so for example if you're like level one level two right you can if you're let's say level two which is you know just a little bit right you can teach level one if you're level three you can teach level two level one right and oh there's all so many websites on which you can teach we and we have so many students that actually do that and they make an extra 500 bucks and we'll get into what you can make in a second here but they make 500 a thousand bucks extra right rishi actually rishi he makes a makes an extra 1000k i think somebody named 2k no actually just from teaching and coaching right it's insane yeah it's pretty amazing cool so let's go ahead that's that's pretty cool teaching coaching and again make sure you guys are taking pictures make sure you're taking screenshots by the way i want to add a cool thing about coaching and teaching is you kind of relearn what you already learned you get to reinforce those things because now when you're trying to coach it you have to learn it at a more deeper and technical level so it just enforces everything you've done so yes of course okay let's talk about what your stream of income in the first one want to thrive for three months while learning javascript coding looks like okay so now again this stuff only applies if you are working hard guys very important work hard right do your best i say and forget the rest okay work hard because nothing pays off like hard work all right cool next up by teaching javascript to students who are the one level behind your learning that's how the first time we're going to make right then let's go ahead and take a look at this so how here's the question how okay generally one student will pay you let's say 50 bucks okay so let's go ahead and let's we'll calculate this one so 50 bucks per hour okay and work with you two hours in one session okay so let's think about it so you're in one session you make how much once you make what a hundred bucks okay a hundred bucks okay so that's like for example you have just learned so let's say you've just learned for example some basic javascript right and you want to teach you know some basic javascript heck you built you built a slack clone and you went to this react.js challenge and now you have some good experience right well let's think about this you have one student that pays you two hours for one session let's say the one session you have one per week okay like one session per week okay so 100 that's 100 bucks per week for one month that's how much four sessions per month ish yes that's how much how much money is that oh 400. so that's 400 bucks per month correct so far 400 400 per month right right how much is that per year that will be 400 times 12 which is 4 800. so 4 800 per year guys that's extra money of just you putting two hours in right two hours in to coaching someone something that you've learned not sorry not too long ago right not too long ago and you know some basic stuff but the cool part about this is not only are you making right not only making four thousand look at this now they're making four thousand eight hundred per year but also you're also learning more because there's a saying learning you learn more when you teach right what is the same call you learn more when you teach learn more thank you when you teach right right so this is the big part about teaching and we've emphasized this so much right so that's only one student guys so from one student could be making 4 800 bucks who down the comments below who wants to be able to make an extra 4 800 or 5 thousand dollars you know extra per year just like that from one session dropped in the comments and this is what we call this upward spiral of success because as you're coaching more students you're learning more but you're also getting paid more so you want to do that activity you're having more fun so you coach more students and you get paid more and you have more fun and then it's just happiness all the way up to the top right yes and this is a way that you could definitely achieve that yes of course 100 and let's say okay so you have one student but let's say you have two students okay let's say you have two two students how much is that per year now uh we would double that nine thousand nine thousand six hundred that's nine times six hundred so two students right that's already all let me call it this out two students that's already guys nine thousand six hundred right there like seriously right that's 10k 10k per year for some people that is their that is full minimum wage right for some people who are working per year right and they're making they're working 40 hours per week or 40 hours per week right but here you have two students and you coaching them and not only are you coaching you're learning and you're doing something positive for yourself right so that's how we offset this so much but that doesn't stop there guys it does not stop there because let's say now you get better at it now you increase your price from 50 per hour right 50 per hour per hour to now how much let's say 60 or 75 per hour yeah you know that's you could actually do that 100 i charge 250 per hour yo let's go you know you can get that right you can get to that point right so slowly slowly slowly increase increase increase your pricing right and guys and i'm just saying this stuff not to just be all fancy i'm saying this this is a real world right right people will pay that kind of that kind of money right if you find them right they are people but you also have to develop that skill to get to our nozzles of like two or 250 an hour right you just can't come off the bat you have to teach you functions and objects yeah for 250 and then no that's just not gonna work right so you have to get to that right but how this is why i say take this stuff what you're learning right now so so importantly okay guys all right let's go ahead and move on so uh really quickly move on so that's a hundred dollars per person like i said so to make your monthly more income from one student that's 400 per month we said that okay cool so how can you get an actual coaching client right yeah what can you start to do so you can so how do you do that okay again write this stuff down guys very very very very importante okay well that's going can you make that again thank you there we go it always looks i don't know why that happens all the time but so let's go ahead and let's say that you dm 100 people on facebook right now you might be asking okay how do you dm 100 people well you might get 100 people through a few tools okay so for example let me just let's think about this uh i'm gonna put frisbee done so that might be through facebook so you may be your facebook group right you go to a facebook group you find a javascript facebook or react.js facebook group a coding facebook group okay boom right there that right there right there by the way gives opportunity to dm people now don't spam because they'll throw you out but make sure make sure make sure that you're just simply just giving value okay maybe you go through craigslist right so you say hey i will go ahead and provide free lessons or maybe lessons to you for 25 an hour or 15 hour right now right and maybe you can sign up with some free lessons just to get your foot in the door right craig's list right what other tools can i use to be able to find people i mean just even then other social medias like facebook's if you have your personal one right you could go into instagram linkedin right i mean whoever it is that people are that want to learn how to code you just have to think about where can i find these people yeah now again this stuff is really simple guys how do you do how do you get to this stuff right how do you get people to trust you because the biggest reason why people get nowhere is because of trust okay because of trust they don't trust you so this is why we say it's so important share what you're doing on social media if people see that you are sharing coding you're saying yes right they trust you if they see you partying they're not gonna trust you i'm sorry that's not somebody that you they're going to trust i'm not going to trust somebody who parties in pictures all the time and says uh yeah yeah yeah they are going to teach me hell no no i want someone who has pictures of coding and their journey on how they're learning to code that is someone who i'm gonna be building a relationship with like wow i want to learn from them exactly okay respond let's say 20 people respond to you okay five people you're gonna call or show they are interested you close one when you say close meaning you sign up one person that's thirty two hundred three hundred and twenty dollars per month from one pain student boom right but you have to be able to put in the work this stuff right here guys right this stuff is not easy this stuff makes you make sure you put in the work right you have to dm 100 people they won't come magically to you i'm sorry that's just not going to happen right so they have to do it okay cool next up like we said you know this is simple but not easy you have to put in that hard work so if you want to make 3 dollars per month or three or thirty six thousand dollars per year you'll have to do 10x more work right you have to do 10x more clients right so where can i find these javascript students to coach well pretty simple you're going to want to take a screenshot really simple of this but go ahead nas so facebook group part one instagram part two why isn't really important for those who are in us why isn't is a great way to get started we have a lot so many people even we have lam one of the coaches uh lemon's actually out did we have lemon on the thing i don't think we did i maybe not so lamb is actually another he actually is a new is someone who's new who joined our team as well he does weizen as well and he's been doing wiser for a long time that's has been for a big part of him was was his primary work guys right it's been killing and wise end right take lessons right people per hour i mean craigslist upwork fiverr fiverr is a big one for those of you for those of you let me go ahead and i know those of you who are in other countries maybe you're not in us that's fine there's still a lot of opportunities fiverr is a good one linkedin is a good one right craigslist is a good one people per hour is a good one instagram all these other ones are still still applicable to you just the wise and then ticklish might not be applicable to you right so that's pretty much it but these are applicable guys these are applicable cool and more of course so working from home that's the cool really cool part that you get to do when you work from home guys exactly so that was being a coach being a mentor to someone so what is another way not that people can start to make money online as a developer well pretty simple guys you can also do freelancing so let's say you first do coaching correct you did coaching that was your first part now you feel like you've gone to a certain level you know your stuff okay maybe now you want to find clients and do some coaching up freelance and freelancing yeah and you pick up a project right yeah yeah so what you do is you go to upwork for example or freelancer.com let me go ahead and put those names down on here so let me go blah blah blah i'm gonna put this down so for example you go to free and free free freelancer right or let's say you go to upwork for example upwork i know i know it's so small upwork for example right you go those sites and they give you opportunity to find clients oh heck maybe you find a friend who needs a work right a friend a friend right that's actually the best way to get your first freelancing client is actually through people you know yes because word of mouth and referrals are very very powerful very if you can for example call up your you know mom dad pops you know grandpa grandma and they know somebody or your friends right and they know somebody who might need some work done maybe it's a website do it do it do it do it right because getting the first gig is the hardest thing for freelancers okay and so i highly recommend you and getting trust to do that first job is the hardest thing part as well yeah cause once you have that trust you build more projects you add to your portfolio now people can look back at those projects and be like wow like nas has done all these amazing projects they're going to be a perfect fit for the website that i need to be built exactly exactly and once you have your first client guys that's it you can how you have your second client and your third client and then you can increase your per hour price and you just keep going keep going my snowballs my friend blick o'connelly he i know you could you guys can check him out on instagram by the name easy eazy he's a great guy this guy started as a freelancer did not go to college at all did not go to college he was doing freelancing actually during high school he didn't even finish a high school degree guys that's crazy he was actually on profit with javascript uh coaching call we we had him as a guest right and this guy he built a multimillion dollar freelancing business he now owns an audi r8 he is on so many different cars like gtr and this guy is killing it in freelancing business he has now a team of 10 to 15 people it's insane but he started out with small projects simple projects right was just teaching himself but most importantly what he had is actually guys what a lot of people don't have is he had the drive hmm that's huge he had the drive to do it he's like i wanted to do it and a big part of the drive actually was his family was his mom so he wanted to support her that was a big drive for his uh for his so guys yeah amazing guy again but that's just one example yeah and just quick to quickly touch on that that goes back to what i mentioned before about the why oh we have a guest first oh look at who we have here yo what's up guys how's it going so amazing to see you by the way i just want to say guys really quickly i'm loving your guys's energy in the challenge thank you so much for being on here um i wasn't on here because my mom just had open heart surgery so i was in chicago i'm back here these guys are crushing it guys please show them love and support and drop some amazing energy in the comments they're working their ass off this room is extremely hot and the lights are making them sweaty so show some love i love you guys and thank you guys for crushing hey let's let's get on fire for qazi bro everybody in the comments let's go guys please send prayers for my mom she's going to recover free yes but your prayers will definitely help i love you guys i appreciate y'all yeah let's go ahead and do that and look oh where's the beard oh clean as heck man love you bro all right guys let's go ahead and move on thank you awesome cool so guys that is two ways that you can start to make money what is the third one well as you can see this guy dropping permanent job guys that's your third part and you can be doing all those three guys at the same time right freelancing permanent job right and we talk about the benefits to permanent job to freelancing to full time right those all those three aspects are opportunities for you to become become developers okay all right let's go ahead and move on so as we've said okay i love this part one this is your pyramid of success of wealth this is how we get the wealth okay okay what's number one all right so part one is you learn of course at first you have to develop some skills okay you have to go ahead develop some skills right here okay learn javascript learn react.js okay this is why you are here you're in the learning phase right now maybe you're someone else maybe you're learning react.js but maybe you already know javascript who knows but if you're complete beginner you're currently here right here that's your step okay after that step maybe you do coaching right so the coaching again that requires a skill level of only a beginner okay only beginner and you teach coding to other people right so again time to build stream income one or three months so in one month you could be looking at potentially coaching other people granted we've had students who joined this challenge and we're teaching other people within a week of this challenge five days guys i'm not kidding five days right so there's a lot of opportunities here and that's the income of 3000k per month right 2000 per month next up we have freelancing right to work for clients independently and that requires intermediate skills so at this point you have to make know some coding right you have to be able to build some projects right and that's the streaming of you might be up within four to 12 months that's about 5k per month okay awesome now next up let's go ahead after you do freelancing you might be looking at a fulltime job that's the advanced level right there but it's advanced with a grain of salt why to be able to get to that point you definitely just need to develop a lot of skills when you're going there right and i mean in terms of the time we do have the 12 to 24 months but it's just going to depend a lot on your specific journey and what you do i mean if you happen to go into something like um full stack mastery boot camp that might be a little bit faster it might not take 12 to 24 months of javascript or profit with javascript as well right it's going to speed up because you're investing into mentors that are going to help you to speed up that process to speed up that journey exactly exactly so all the different parts of your job look let's switch back to here guys are really important right and all this income let's say you do all this right here you maybe let's say you do coaching you know for example rishi in our who was our student initially and now is just killing it with students and has a job and everything he was doing freelancing right let's say you do all this stuff so you do income or three keep a month then five key per month let's say do freelancing and i also have a fulltime job you're looking around 15k per month as a full developer now i won't lie to you right this stuff takes takes a lot of work and a lot of patience okay you can't get to this within a day or two days right it's gonna take a lot of work so that's really important and you might not be able to do everything all once that's just simple as that maybe you just simply do coaching maybe you just do freelancing maybe you find out to yourself that it's really hard for you to do all these three so you just stick to one which is just simply job the cool part about it is when you stick to one guys is you have the opportunity to really grow this income 70 per month that's just starting you can scale that 8k 10k like 15k you can focus on that yes just on the just on the fulltime job and i actually i actually recommend a lot of people to do to do that kind of focus focus on one thing at a time and sometimes of course you have to spread yourself a little bit thin like we ourselves here me daniel we spread ourselves thin here at this point right between coaching others to doing live streams to doing you know so many different things in the company we love it but we've we've given ourselves time to learn this stuff yeah right but then just kind of like hey guys just do everything no we give ourselves subscribe to learn it okay cool all right next up so guys we are at currently at a thousand seventy seven likes can we get two thousand a hundred likes bro whoa what is that twenty twenty thousand one hundred likes guys come on a thousand one hundred likes guys i know you guys can help us out 1077 right now a thousand hundred likes and we'll turn the music up guys come on a thousand hundred likes we are currently at a thousand and eighty two smash that cool button guys we just showed you how to make fifteen thousand dollars a month using this pyramid of success seven give us some likes for that baby 1007 what else what else we got hold on come on 890 1090 can we get to what a thousand one hundred i'm looking at right now a thousand and ninety thousand ninety one ninety four come on you guys got this come on just smash the like button that's how you get it smash it not the hard guys that's it 94 come on let's get 2100 can we get to that and then i'll move on i promise i brought someone how much do you have to slide slide not too much okay cool awesome guys so let's go ahead thousand one hundred like oh oh it just finishes five dollars thousand hundred likes come on let's go that's a lot of energy man that's cool okay so screenshot this screenshot this guys right now because we'll well oh i don't know just did here screenshot this right now because we'll move on here in one second let me put this back for you guys so you can see screenshot this right now and we'll move on right now let's go let's go we'll take you five four three two one and now byebye okay cool so math breakdown for making three keep per month with coaching javascript uh or simplified again so get five percent of the people that you reach out to will become your clients so let's say you reach out to 100 people that's how many people five people right so you reach out to 500 people a hundred people will become your clients it's a five percent close rate we'll say for example right that's what we say so come on right there so five people your clients right but you have to reach out to them of course you have to reach out to 100 100 clients don't disappear out of nowhere that's really important guys to consider okay next up if you reach out to 100 people you will get five billion students let's say each student will pay you 50 per hour that is how much 50 per hour so five students times 50 250 250 250 and let's say you have five students let's say in one week that's 250 in one week yes that's pretty damn good guys and then you multiply that by four that's how much how much that are you throwing a lot of math at me i'm not even thinking bro give me come on dude that's a thousand cape thousand dollars all right well let's let's a thousand dollars this guy worked in amazon he can't do math origin quick maps guys let's go 1 000 oh my god thousand dollars right there guys that's insane cool awesome so let's go ahead so javascript why javascript guys as you guys know this point is a pretty pretty insane tool guys there's so many opportunities right in terms of jobs as you can see right here if we go ahead and search up front developer right there that's ten thousand jobs right there and actually if we search up if we go hey my god i'm going to exit this if i go here for example i say indeed let's go to here actually i'm going to go indeed.com here and let's just say i search up javascript let's say javascript yeah guys i mean these are the current opportunities that are out there right now so look at this guys just check this out okay let me go ahead and zoom in on this okay somebody command plus right right look at this guys 59 000 pretty much almost 60 000 jobs for javascript developers the demand is there you just have to go ahead simply just put in the time and that's pretty much it okay demand is there right just put the time put in the hard work and you will get there let's get that for example let's go and take a look at react gs let's just think about this react reactor react gs react gs for example react gs 2000 uh hold on two thousand eight hundred feet we say for example react for example sixty four thousand more than javascript yeah right there so react 64 000 jobs just like that like holy man that's around the world right now opportunity is there for you to just grab it and cease the moment yes yes yes yes guys so many opportunities look at that salary holy actually let's think about this let me see senior developer 150k 200k per year let's think about this what are they looking for qualifications one year preferred the hell are you serious this is a senior developer no way no way i'm about to submit my application send me that link bro so look at this guys right so looking for example react aws remember how we talked about the devops front full stack right there see devops backhand full stack no react so in this case right so node for example is a back end framework react as a frontend framework you will in this case you will get to learn react and a little part of node kind of how it works right you won't necessarily use node but you will use firebase instead of that kind of to build your back end okay so a lot a lot look at this 150k to 200 key per year holy 401k matching dental insurance oh my god flexible uh life insurance pay time off tuition embarrassment holy who wants to work for this company down below drop in the comments below guys send them the link bro all right so you can see opportunities are there you just have to take them okay awesome so cool so as we're nearing kind of the end guys again these are just some examples all right such opportunities and salary as you can see it just it just doesn't end right like the opportunities are literally limitless in the world of javascript in the world of full stack development from development yes yes yes so less than one year for here one to four years probably nine years again and these are average salaries right here 100k 92k 82k 75k 107k all those are sellers right there so look at this but again like you said at that time where we screenshotted that when javascript had 45k jobs now i had what 60k 60k so it increases it's going up like crazy for up work for example if you type in javascript outbreak is a freelancing uh job you're looking at around 8 000 jobs opportunities freelancing opportunities wow what the so okay next for example these are the countries which shown the most interest and demand for javascript programming usa 5750 per month canada united uk and germany and again because of covet because just in general all these jobs can now be remote so no matter where you are guys right no matter where you are you will have the chance to actually go ahead you have the chance to work for these companies even for your nigeria india right even if you're in different countries like who knows australia i mean i don't know where else might they be spain any other country that's like any other country by remote right it's remote yeah exactly exactly from wherever cool awesome so let's go ahead and move on so here are some uh comments here 100 100 developer jobs companies hiring amid the chronovirus crisis so this is also corona proof right because you know we don't need people in the office at the end of the day you know coding is remote so necessarily needed so coco does not really affect us that much personally a lot of developers are not affected by that like guys these next slides are just showing you guys the abundance of opportunity look like lego is looking for javascript devs you know if we go to the next one you're going to see that then azure is also looking for so it's like so many different places are looking for javascript developers just the opportunities there you just have to put your hand out there work hard grab it cease it and move on grab it grab it grab it grab the arm just take it take it take it it's yours it's yours if you work for it and throw it if you work for it that's all i'm missing exactly and i know there's a lot of like a lot of stuff you hear from yourself a lot of stuff you hear just in general right but you know the more you stuff you hear like this right the more this gets put into your head and the more you understand that holy maybe i do actually need to take some action right cool next up azure is looking for entry level jobs right there right so look at this we're looking for to hire for a number of different roles on the azure functions team from management to industry professionals to entry level across dev and project management let's look at it it's insane okay disney's looking for javascript for example john who's john is this a disney guy we're hiring a disney at disney streaming in particular i'm trying to hire two devs for my team full stack js front end we use angular plus java angular by the way guys it's another framework kind of like react gs all right um cool cool what a guy's name do you have there well let's talk about some frameworks hey cool so the most popular framework right now are ciao for javascript what are the four jobs angular right now okay that's google vue.js guys okay and also react.js let's go that certainly is our choice again you can choose others ugs angular but i highly recommend you start with one sub one can i keep going with that okay no need to learn all of them maybe at some point as you get older as you learn more you'll get the chance to learn more moral goals but for now just start out with react.js and then because since you are in this course right now and you will get go ahead and learn that so holy that's a really sick background by the way it is right i know explosion that's amazing so what companies are using what frameworks well for example okay let's think about this okay um airbnb gs instagram uber e it's dropbox ugs alibaba grammarly look at this all the cool under react js is what i'm seeing right so this is react.js right here right airbnb instagram ubereats dropbox um i don't have on here but in tesla for example tesla for example user regis um netflix uses react.js i know if you know that as well they use node.js for the back end um so many more companies lgs paypal all broke sony and i think google you google used it uh angular as well too so again they're all different options all many options you know but again not the most important just pick one and start stick with one whichever one so what shall i choose that's good question that's a great question as you see this right here is something called a stack overflow survey what is that a stack overflow survey well one of stack is like one of the biggest websites for devs and the survey is when they ask people questions so they went to the big website of developers and asked them what frontend framework are using should you use do you want and look at this amazing response guys yes so react gs is the most wanted dynasty we have ugs then we have angular okay and the angularjs now i actually started with angularjs when i started a long time ago yeah a long time ago i started with angularjs yes react.js at that point when i started was not popular not very popular that was like seven years ago or something so i didn't have the chance to work with react but now because the community and because the support it's just grown to an immense it's huge and that's why we're making this challenge so everyone right now just point that.net all the way in the bottom and laugh and then just laugh because we're learning react js which is one of the most popular ones one of the best libraries out there i mean that is still not bad bro but but it's at the end so huh for those of you who are asking what is the difference between um react gs and angular it's pretty much just syntax it's right just an angular 7 syntax react just is a la is a library so it's actually a lot faster um a lot faster and it's more low level i would say well angular is a framework so it's more high level and it's a little bit slower so there's more more things you need to do on the angular side you know when you're building angular applications okay so that's kind of the difference between that and so forth so cool downloads per year look at this guys react just increasing it's just going okay [Laughter] that wasn't planned there was no plan at all guys or just that in sync yeah yeah so angular right here as you can see angular right here right it's kind of like it's pretty good right it kind of it went up but it's kind of very still right now and of course of course uh we have things like view which was right here which is pretty pretty going pretty fast as well so and this stuff right let's see what do we have well there's a clear winner is there not i think there's a clear winner guy what do you think is i want to drop in the comments below who do you think wins you want to see who you guys think is going to win yes who do you think will win guys huh what do you think tell me let's dance like this dude i love this guy's shoulder movement man everyone's saying react are we coming to a con yeah let's go yes yes yes yes so in our case yes it is react for the win let's go there we go there we go guys everybody say react react let's go let's go awesome again all are amazing but we're going to choose one and continue on with that one okay exactly okay so in our case guys as you as you know in the next five days or so we're going to be building a slack clone right in our case here's kind of like halluci so this is kind of an introduction to how a slack clone looks it's pretty and pretty pretty pretty cool um you can sign in with google so you actually have the chance to sign in with google look at this i can do sign in with google click on here i can after that let me go and wait for a second signing with google uh slow wifi guys that's not bad actually that was good that's not that sorry that's like email no here right there cool it's like your email look at this by the way look at this you are in slack long and i can actually type this stuff right here for example here i can type i can say yo yo look kazi was having a conversation by himself with himself yeah and you can actually have more people on this slack channel look at this we have a channel here correct just challenge and we can have multiple channels as well so let's say we had a new channel called what channel should we add uh well we already did the challenge let's cp is the best sp never programmer so we can add our own for example look at this cloud program is now our channel and now in this channel we can now be talking so say yo cp fam right so and you guys at the end of this call at the end of this call but the end of this challenge will be able to have this slack for yourself and be able to have other people join it and you can be talking live with them that is so powerful just how we are live with you right now right through youtube you'll be live with them chatting just like how you are on messages or whatsapp or what other messaging tool you use this is the cool part about how pumped are you you're going to build this slack loan let us know in the comments below guys how pumped are you to build this because we're pretty much pretty much pretty pumped i mean we're i mean we're pretty excited man we're hyped we're high we're hype so if you're possible let us know in the comments below come on cp let's go people are pumped it up people are pumped tony is pumped up i can see right there tony's pumped up let's go to five seconds let's go holy that's crazy to the extreme pumped up that's what i'm talking about let's go okay cool guys so let's move on this is what you get to build now here are the tools you get to learn guys as we build this stuff all right let's go and go back to here okay so you get to use you you get to use firebase what is firebase and why is it so important for first development you tell me well firebase is what's going to allow us to have the data in the back because as you saw in the live chat it's getting the actual history of the chat from somewhere right correct so for example you see how i'm putting the data here what do you think this is being saved guys this is being saved in firebase right in firebase this data right as i type something into input this goes like let's let's think about this okay so we have let me go ahead and put this for you somewhat on we say firebase here okay let's do uh let's do brush tool so let's say this is five this is our database okay you type here it goes to firebase and firebase actually updates what we have here and when you reload when you reload your page it actually comes from firebase and that's how we see this same thing here it goes with the cloud this channels right here right this stuff comes from firebase you see what i mean yeah that's how it works that's powerful right and the firebase auto loads that's the cool part about firebase it auto loads um live no not a lot out of shows out of lowes what is this uh auto shows live messaging basically allows us to do live master that's the really cool part about firebase okay okay next up if we go ahead let's go ahead keep going i guess that's the way we're going to use tool okay next up so boom it's easy as that bro uh that's insane let's go ahead and keep going it's free oh yeah did i mention this for you guys it's freaking easy to use yes oh something is a real time thank you so much oh my god finally i was looking for that it's real time firebase is real time yeah sometimes i can't read naz's brain i know come on bro we gotta stay on top of this yeah i gotta step back i'm sorry guys and i guess and also not only will firebase be the one to do realtime data by the fibers will also also be hosting our application so in the end of our slack clone we finish this we're going to finish the cycle on day one two four on four right you will host your your your app on something called firebase hosting and you will have a live to share and not to share with your friends with your family like yo check out what i built so you're gonna get a link guys you're gonna have a specific link that someone can go to and start to mess around with your application because you're making the real live application exactly exactly cool so all right so we got that portion now here's again this is what you'll get to get to build who's excited for that let us know in the comments below with even login made with firebase as well so login by the way is also with firebase so again it's just a really cool tool so what what are what's the stack what's the

chance not only to build a portfolio to kickstart you your korea's just developer but also but also to go ahead and actually win a prize of 15k boot 15k bootcamp fullsize mastery price so that's pretty sick okay cool so here how to learn a code believe you're a limb list that's part one growth mindset think you need to believe in yourself and to believe that there is more to you than right now right that the fact that there is more opportunities there are more possibilities a lot of people unfortunately are stuck in a mindset they're stuck and believing the fact that they can't do it right i guess again guys we're going to come to a close now at this point right daily habits i'm coding code daily daily daily abc right always be coding yes yes oh thank you always be coding right one hour 30 minutes at least something that is how you when you build you put those hours that is how you get the results you want yes right if you do it once a month that's not going to take you anything i've had students like that i'm sorry they're not gonna go anywhere right if you don't do that cool awesome how to learn to code well um why can't i not solve this so you can be either you could be like this angry guy here yeah it could be like this cool i mean essentially what this breaks down to is you can take on two different mindsets you could take on the problemcentric mindset or problemoriented mindset like this guy over here he's got a problem he's mad about the problem can you show the slide real quick oh thank you he's mad about the problem so he hits his computer with this keyboard because he's focused so much on the problem or you could become solution oriented where you try to figure out like you see the problem and try to figure out the solution to fix that specific problem exactly so you could be either here or here right your mind should always be how can i solve this nah and not oh i'm stuck or i can't do it it should be always how can i do it now i not i can't do it there's a saying that says if i can't then i must and if i must then i can read that study that put it into your brain tattoo it if you have to because exactly because you can't

courses and so forth right that's the best to start out and then build projects build projects by yourself very important okay by yourself as well awesome um yes these videos are saved on youtube and

welcome to um popping in to say hi hey logan what's up hey good to see you logan let's go dude i haven't seen logan in a while i know jenny says are we supposed to install everything node react by ourselves don't worry we'll provide you some some instructions so david if you can provide instructions for them maybe help them out maybe create a small little video we'll go ahead and do that for you don't worry we'll get you we got you don't worry okay how about i start the same motivate motivate the code because after participating so much i fall out and lose interest it's pretty guys so number one it's pressure it's actually pressure on yourself don't put so much pressure yourself find a way to enjoy coding right so actually just have fun with it a lot of people pressure themselves thinking that if they can't do something they can't solve it that's it it's not meant for them but that's not the reality of things no i mean even then it's all like a lot of things that you try to do whether it's coding or anything else there's gonna be a lot of challenges there's gonna be a lot of obstacles there's gonna be a lot of failure but you have to stick with so very often instead of trying to ask yourself how do you stay motivated try to ask yourself how can you stay disciplined because motivation is gonna be up and down depending on the day but discipline can be there for you day after day after day so if you switch that question and you see the habits that you have to build that's going to help you to keep on moving forward even when it gets tough yes yes yes of course of course and of course guys very important i want to say go ahead and tag us check us on instagram let's go ahead let me show you where the tag is right there take us right here cleverkazee nazdamanski daniel safer right here take us instagram show us what you got because that's how we see your passion your drive and that's how we consider you also for you know the prizes you know apart from just being a good positive person and uh you know you know and showing us what you got in terms of actual coding okay so really important so screenshot this if you have to but yeah share us there cool awesome awesome next next up let's see who let's go love team cp let's go amazing love it love it love it okay any thoughts on data science oh hi i'm rice i'm exploring many different programming um let's see career options any thoughts on a data science field you guys are great by the way thank you so much so uh data science is amazing i mean what's your take on i've been talking a lot what's your take on it nice save naz so here's my take on data science right is in programming there's gonna be so many different fields there's gonna be so many new shiny objects so i think it's gonna come back to what i said in this live before which is you have to be selfaware if you personally like developing web applications and you want to become a web developer then go for that path if you like to go more towards the route of being able to get a lot of data put it in a way that people can see it data analytics data science data analysis all those things then it might be something worth exploring but in the end there's no perfect path just choose something that's congruent with you and that you will like i agree with that try data science data science is uh is an important field that's going very fast may that be with javascript or python um you know i built my first machine learning algorithm using from a free course that i did which has been amazing and that actually is what got me an internship that's that was awesome as well um so there's a lot of opportunities to grow there and it's also really fun like right i mean think about a tesla for example right like how do you think their cars can do alipa like i test i drove my the tesla yesterday and it's crazy like bro it just drives by itself yeah like it was just there and the wheels like turning by itself just turning like whoa what's going on but it did that because it had a lot of data yeah all this data is coming in and the the the vehicle is figuring out what it has to do next yeah super important but see if you really like it give it a try if you don't like it it's all fine you can yeah yeah but you know as you're doing data science no matter which field you start out with the cool part is you will build the problemsolving mind so if you let's say you try to design so you didn't like it you can very easily transfer out to fullsize development or frontend or backend so easily because you already have the problem solving mind of a developer and that's why it's important to know and understand the fundamentals because the fundamentals you can translate from different fields to different languages yes so portfolio guys please hear me out portfolio link is going to be in the facebook post when you post it gosh darn it and if you're not on the facebook group click the link below to join the challenge so that you can get into the facebook group yeah yeah okay awesome learning drift that's who says you will learn js and html css together as you're doing this kind of stuff so like in this react.js challenge again you're going to learn this together okay so don't worry about it uh one thing i will say to you is just oh 1.2 k likes one point yeah i mean can we get to one point three kill likes let's go yo thank you tiger one two three four everyone up so you get to 1.3 1.3 you don't know it cool all right any more questions we have to make exact some yes correct yes yes that's correct of course if you want to modify it modify to your liking that's always going to give you some extra points yes of course a complete new person will can win this right as long as you go ahead and show us what you got as you as long as you go ahead and show us your ability your excitement right that's the only thing that we need guys okay it's the only thing we need guys right that's it so yeah i mean that's that's pretty much it right that's literally it like guys we're not doing it based off of like the coolest thing it's a lot of mix of a lot of different things like how much effort did you put in were you engaging with the community were you supporting other people were you showing up to the calls at 11 a.m pst on every day monday through friday yes these next couple days what are you doing all these things and participating and do you deserve to get the 15 000 prize of full stack mastery boot camp exactly that is what we're looking at so it doesn't matter your skill level right now it matters where you end up by the end of these next five days and proper javascript as well so use a lot exactly so yes javascript or java um i would say javascript what do you think depends what you want to do right i mean if you're trying to do java stuff then go do java stuff but we're here to learn front and stuff we're here to build an amazing slack clone so in this case the answer is oh my gosh so much fun cool awesome all right let's see up next guys we'll go and stay on there for about one minute so guys kazi is here you guys he just jumped on for a second guys as you guys know uh khazia's mom was actually in the hospital she had triple bypass surgery so he had to kind of step away for a little bit right let's go ahead and wish qazi and his mom you know uh a amazing recovery right make sure you have kaiju's mom in her prayer in your prayers as well you know so she can recover as fast as possible guys uh but yeah yeah that's just why qazi hasn't been even been able to be on here guys right because of course family is always number one guys family is always number one always no matter what no matter what guys it's always number one okay that's very important to us to everybody we're here as a family right we're here as a family sscp team and we're here as a family when we when we as a family is you know we have we have each other as a family and

have as always redfield yo bradfield what's up what's up qazi what's up bradfield good to hear good to see you god bless yes love cause in the fam yes thank you so much appreciate you guys thank you guys for the score you guys are great of course guys appreciate it good vibes always always good vibes no matter what always good vibes you think it's bad to explore many programming languages let me see angelo asked do you think it's bad hold on to explore many programming languages and not specialize in one uh no it's not bad honestly the more you learn that the better right as you get better in one language then you say go to another language get better than language that will actually improve your ability in a different language yes i will say however before you try to explore these languages really master one really get one down and understand it because if you just try to learn all these different languages at the same time you're gonna get really confused and you're not gonna learn a lot of things so secret one in the beginning get really good at it master it and then later you can go out and explore with everything else yes yes of course of course okay what's the facebook group guys facebook group is down below join the javascript challenge the react.js challenge down below join the facebook group when you join you will have access to facebook group and discord that's
