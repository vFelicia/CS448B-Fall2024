05:14 - you there we go
05:16 - all right cool so program basic guys
05:18 - three
05:19 - two one so here's the question here okay
05:23 - how many bits are equal to one byte what
05:26 - do you guys think how many bits
05:27 - are equal to one but you guys have three
05:29 - seconds to answer
05:32 - all right let's go
05:36 - eight how many bits are equal to one
05:39 - bite
05:40 - wait i know this one
05:46 - what do you think you got it maybe
05:50 - maybe
05:53 - let's see all right let's see let's see
05:54 - let's see let's see 23 answers all right
05:57 - what do we have what do we have
06:01 - and we have a b it's equal to one but
06:04 - which one did you get
06:05 - yeah i was wrong
06:08 - all right so eight bits is equal to one
06:11 - byte
06:12 - guys that is what it is okay awesome
06:14 - let's go ahead again let's let me see
06:15 - who's the leader board here
06:18 - beginner wait did i not get it right oh
06:20 -  cuz i took time
06:21 - so beginner is winning all right next
06:25 - one
06:25 - let's go next one what is the output of
06:29 - this
06:30 - what do you think wait wait
06:35 - [Music]
06:37 - don't look
06:38 - [Music]
06:42 - all right let's see
06:46 - ten answers eleven you guys have ten
06:48 - seconds ten nine
06:50 - eight seven six five
06:54 - four three two
06:57 - one oh it's lamb
07:03 - somebody's sad
07:06 - wait something you said right there
07:12 - do you know why you know why
07:15 - so the reason why is because let me go
07:17 - first show media so let's check this out
07:19 - the reason why that's the case
07:21 - is because in programming ooh that's
07:24 - interesting that was your drawing
07:25 - yeah that was interesting so the reason
07:28 - why guys is actually because
07:29 - in this is an array right here right
07:31 - this is the race as you guys potentially
07:32 - know right
07:33 - now to access an array what's going on
07:35 - here is we're console logging we're
07:37 - outputting something right
07:38 - and we're outputting you know the
07:40 - instructors at position two you see this
07:42 - two
07:43 - there's two right so now what did you
07:45 - think this actually means tell me
07:47 - this two means what do you think this
07:48 - two means
07:50 - uh the second one the second one so
07:53 - that's all
07:54 - that's a lot of people think right
07:55 - you'll be it'll be jess is that what you
07:56 - picked
07:57 - so the reason why it's actually not just
07:59 - is because in
08:00 - um in programming everything starts from
08:03 - zero yeah that's why i thought
08:04 - after i saw that the answer was uh lim
08:06 - uh-huh
08:07 - that's what i thought you thought it was
08:09 - yeah it was zero one two yeah yeah
08:11 - because right now the first the first
08:13 - index this is called
08:14 - index always starts from zero then we
08:16 - have one and then we have
08:18 - two right there exactly and that's kind
08:20 - of how it always kind of starts out in
08:22 - programming guys so just so you know
08:24 - okay
08:24 - somebody now i get it there we go
08:28 - beautiful beautiful
08:29 - yeah so that's really fun one right zero
08:32 - one
08:32 - two always remember this in programming
08:34 - everything starts from
08:35 - exactly z zero
08:38 - exactly all right let's go and continue
08:40 - on so that's the reason why we have this
08:42 - beautiful all right
08:43 - next one let's see uh
08:47 - okay all right you guys ready let's see
08:49 - who got the next chord
08:52 - oh
08:54 - [Applause]
08:55 - [Music]
08:57 - [Applause]
08:57 - [Music]
09:06 - is
09:09 - [Music]
09:12 - okay next one are you guys ready yes or
09:14 - no all right nas
09:15 - but something you said yes
09:18 - that's funny all right next one next all
09:21 - right i got this really quickly
09:23 - what is the output of the first and
09:24 - second answer okay quickly
09:30 - wait what okay
09:35 - okay
09:36 - [Music]
09:48 - i got it that's it yeah picked i don't
09:51 - know why i picked
09:52 - it picked such a long time 90 seconds
09:55 - huh i don't know i don't know why it's
10:02 - ah
10:04 - all right 12 answers guys who can do
10:06 - more
10:08 - don't give the answers out in the
10:09 - comments guys
10:12 - don't look
10:15 - you're trying to help me huh they're
10:17 - trying to help me no guys don't help her
10:24 - let's go come on come on what do you
10:26 - guys think what you guys think
10:29 - what you guys think huh have 156 people
10:33 - live holy moly
10:34 - let's go all right let's go
10:38 - all right and what do we have
10:42 - [Music]
10:45 - uh yeah i think so i'm gonna go ahead
10:46 - click uh can i if i click skip will they
10:49 - actually count oh no
10:50 - i don't know
10:53 - i think if they click skip it will
10:55 - actually count let me see skip
10:58 - oh
11:02 - which one did you pick that one that's
11:04 - the one you picked yeah really
11:05 - yep yeah look at that did you guys help
11:08 - her out no they did not okay
11:10 - they helped me out after okay all right
11:14 - so
11:14 - again the reason why let's go through
11:16 - this why this is happening right why is
11:18 - this happening guys
11:19 - well very simply okay i'll go stop this
11:22 - one
11:24 - i need to remove this portion right here
11:25 - from my side okay
11:28 - so the reason why this is happening is
11:29 - very simple right if you think about
11:30 - this right let's think about this right
11:32 - well we have console log z that's the
11:34 - output right so that means that's kind
11:35 - of what well it gets outputted right
11:37 - well let's think about this we have z is
11:39 - the variable
11:40 - and we have x is also variable here you
11:42 - see that now
11:44 - this variable the value of this variable
11:46 - is 10. yeah the value of this variable
11:48 - is basically x plus 5 which is
11:52 - 15. yeah so that's 15 is the first
11:54 - answer and then we have next one we have
11:56 - x equals 20
11:57 - right and then z is equal to x plus five
12:01 - same thing 25 25. so it's pretty simple
12:03 - did you guys get that you guys
12:04 - understood that yes yes yes yes yes
12:06 - somebody said minha said there would be
12:07 - an error there yes there will be an
12:08 - error there
12:09 - i'm not sure where's the ear but the
12:11 - error i don't think there's an error
12:13 - here
12:14 - is there an error i don't think so
12:16 - anyway so that is the answer let's see
12:18 - who's the winner of this one
12:20 - and we have
12:23 - nasa's still on the running let's go
12:25 - let's go let's go now they're still in
12:27 - the running let's go
12:28 - okay but andy is coming up really quick
12:32 - look at this andy beginner pratik okay
12:34 - that's up where are you at i don't see
12:35 - you on there
12:36 - yeah i know
12:40 - all right next one what do you create
12:42 - well how do you create a function in
12:43 - javascript
12:45 - how do you create a function in
12:46 - javascript what do you guys think
12:48 - oh i gotta answer hold on otherwise
12:51 - i'll lose
12:52 - wait wait no come on we're connecting um
12:56 - okay i got it don't look i'm not yeah
12:59 - you are
12:59 - no i'm not yeah you are i'm not she's
13:01 - looking guys no
13:03 - yeah she is no okay let's see let's see
13:06 - let's see
13:06 - [Music]
13:10 - nope nope i put the comments up just
13:13 - look at the comments guys do not help
13:15 - other people well they just showed me
13:18 - that i'm wrong
13:19 - that's all i did
13:23 - all right let's see what you guys think
13:25 - what are you guessing
13:27 - all right let's see all right 21 you
13:30 - guys have 10 seconds left 10 seconds 10
13:33 - nine eight seven
13:36 - six five four
13:39 - three two one
13:42 - and the answer is i was wrong
13:47 - that is the way they beat gohan and
13:49 - create a function is you call the first
13:51 - first you call at first you call
13:53 - function
13:54 - right first you call function and then
13:56 - after that you say the function name and
13:58 - then you put parentheses around it to
13:59 - give it that
14:00 - can biscuit to start a function and then
14:02 - you actually use brackets for that as
14:03 - well so that's how you do that awesome
14:04 - let's go and continue on beautiful
14:06 - all right next one is
14:10 - wait who's going to know oh i'm still
14:12 - not i'm still black dynamite is coming
14:14 - up though black diamond
14:15 - is almost there black diamond is almost
14:17 - there let's go black dynamite
14:18 - whoo beautiful all right next one you
14:20 - ready are you sure
14:22 - as ready as i'll ever be are you
14:24 - harmless already as ready as i'll ever
14:26 - be
14:28 - let's go all right next one and what
14:30 - does it mean if
14:32 - if true is returned what does it mean
14:34 - what does it mean if true is returned
14:36 - guys what do you guys think
14:37 - if true is returned okay i know this one
14:41 - oh i got this one i got this one
14:45 - are you looking at me don't look that's
14:47 - the wrong answer did you already pick it
14:49 - no good well thank you
14:52 - for that
14:58 - so this by the way just so you guys know
15:00 - the module is here
15:02 - this month so this module is right here
15:08 - okay guys if you're spamming i'm gonna
15:10 - cut you out right now all right
15:12 - let me see where's this guy if you're
15:14 - spamming
15:15 - oh i enjoy i enjoy this
15:18 - right here so much there we go beautiful
15:22 - so guys so just so you know right what
15:25 - does this module
15:26 - mean this right here this modulus means
15:29 - that a number can be divided by two
15:32 - equal like if a number could be divided
15:34 - by two what does that mean
15:36 - what does it mean if a number can always
15:38 - be divided by two
15:40 - even exactly so it's this one
15:43 - right hand that's what i chose really
15:45 - yeah let's go
15:47 - hey let's go that's not an easy one
15:50 - yeah well i just figured because of math
15:56 - all right let's go somebody said 15 25.
15:57 - that does not that's not the answer guys
15:59 - all right there we go next one wow a lot
16:02 - of you guys did that holy moly
16:05 - i'm surprised so like i said guys the
16:07 - reason why this is the answer is very
16:09 - simply because
16:10 - why i modules 2 right here means that a
16:13 - number can be divided by 2 evenly
16:15 - right modulus means modulus actually is
16:18 - an operator
16:19 - that means basically
16:22 - how much something is left that's what
16:24 - that means so basically like
16:26 - if i do five modulus two
16:29 - the answer for that will be one because
16:31 - the remainder from that is one
16:33 - because four divided by two is even
16:35 - right so it'll be two times two
16:37 - and then the remainder of that will be
16:38 - one understand yeah
16:40 - awesome sweet so let's continue on
16:44 - let's go all right wait
16:48 - all right okay next one and we have
16:51 - oh nas is still in the winding let's go

17:10 - have some fun sometimes you know i know
17:13 - how else are you very far behind wait
17:16 - you just told us the answer i did not
17:17 - tell you guys the answer
17:19 - i never told you guys the answer did i
17:21 - tell you guys the answer no no i didn't
17:22 - tell you
17:23 - no all right next one next up what is
17:27 - and and
17:28 - end wait i actually don't know this one

17:44 - is it i might have gotten this one wrong
17:45 - actually hold on
17:48 - because i forgot the name actually do
17:49 - you remember from like code academy
17:51 - really yeah your mom with this one
17:53 - because i forgot to recognize it
17:55 - i know i mean i know what it is i know i
17:57 - know what it does but i think i got it
18:00 - wrong
18:02 - oh man yeah i got it wrong
18:06 - damn it hmm
18:23 - don't tell the answer valeria says don't
18:24 - tell the answer guys
18:26 - all right guys and how do we have 26
18:28 - answers 27 answers
18:30 - since one day more people come into here
18:32 - [Music]
18:34 - logic go let's go oh let's go
18:37 - all right and we're done and ten nine
18:40 - eight
18:41 - seven six five quattro
18:46 - uno oh
18:50 - it's a logical operator i put down
18:52 - conditional operator for some reason i
18:53 - don't know the comparison
18:55 - the comparison operator that's that's a
18:56 - pretty good choice too dang it i don't
18:58 - know
18:58 - i thought it was because it's inside a
19:00 - conditional see
19:02 - even a pro developer sometimes we'll get
19:04 - we'll get messed up
19:06 - yeah that's okay all right mistakes
19:08 - happen
19:09 - yeah why this guy be so annoying i don't
19:12 - know if i'm annoyed then just you know
19:14 - then move away from this youtube channel
19:15 - from this youtube video
19:19 - oh no oh no but again i'm coming for you
19:22 - my friend i am coming for you my friend
19:23 - he's not a beginner
19:25 - he's not a beginner no he's a beginner
19:26 - just you know but i'm worried i come i
19:28 - got you i got you don't worry
19:30 - i got you i got you
19:33 - all right next one i got this one what
19:35 - kind of a loop is this and what is the
19:37 - maximum number of candies i got it
19:39 - okay
19:44 - oh
19:51 - [Music]
19:58 - [Music]
20:05 - got it all right not so sure got it
20:10 - what do you think not so sure but why
20:12 - not i'm trying what is what do you think
20:14 - it is
20:15 - like i recognize that from like from
20:17 - kota candy right
20:19 - yeah but at the same time i'm not sure i
20:22 - just remember it's like seeing it
20:23 - yeah yeah so like what do you think
20:27 - is happening here i'm curious uh
20:30 - well it's greater than or equal to but
20:32 - it says
20:34 - what kind of loop is this and then the
20:35 - maximum number of candies okay
20:37 - so it has to be more than 15
20:40 - but um well it's less than this is less
20:43 - than there's actually
20:44 - x is less than equal to you see that
20:45 - right there
20:49 - so so what happens here is this x
20:51 - actually less than or equal to 15 right
20:53 - so
20:53 - this variable has to be smaller see this
20:56 - right here this bracket means smaller
20:59 - than 15 right here because if it's
21:01 - otherwise if i want to be greater that
21:03 - means i have to do
21:04 - x greater than 15 right here
21:07 - right there that's kind of how that
21:08 - would be yeah
21:10 - yeah yeah it's hard sometimes you can
21:12 - mess up sometimes that's yeah it's hard
21:13 - to do that once though sometimes yeah
21:20 - no i don't know actually do you know
21:22 - [Music]
21:24 - i don't know i don't know actually okay
21:26 - awesome so let's go and continue on
21:27 - awesome so we got that one that's fun
21:29 - so we got ten nine six
21:32 - five four three two
21:35 - one
21:39 - which one is it one is it i got it i got
21:42 - this one
21:42 - i got this one right i got this one
21:43 - right this one right
21:47 - oh let's go hold on make that face again
21:55 - which one did you pick the blue one the
21:58 - blue water what'd you put
21:59 - i mean you're not far it's a while loop
22:01 - you know yeah
22:03 - [Laughter]
22:07 - so the reason guys why we have that
22:10 - it's a do while loop right and if you
22:12 - think about this it's not a while loop
22:14 - so while loop will actually have the
22:16 - while on this right here will actually
22:17 - be on the top
22:19 - so when if you do that then that's
22:21 - called a while loop okay
22:23 - hi everyone hi everyone good good so
22:25 - that's called the while loop so that's
22:26 - on the top right here you see that
22:27 - yeah but because we started with do we
22:29 - do say do
22:30 - and then while something's happening so
22:33 - while something is true
22:35 - so basically do this functionality while
22:38 - something right here is true
22:41 - well what can i say
22:47 - well something is true and the reason
22:49 - why it's 15 and not 16
22:51 - is what do you think guys the reason why
22:52 - it's 15 not 16 is because it's very
22:54 - simple
22:55 - here think about this so it starts off
22:57 - with zero so x
22:58 - usually starts off with zero so we're
23:00 - going to start out with zero initially
23:01 - kind of like this right
23:03 - and then what's going to happen is we're
23:04 - going to what is it what do you think is
23:05 - x plus plus means
23:07 - i don't know so this means increment
23:09 - right this must increment so for example
23:11 - if we have if x is equal to one right
23:13 - now
23:14 - right is equal to one right now right if
23:17 - i do x plus plus it's gonna be equal to
23:22 - you tell me
23:26 - so so if i do x plus plus
23:29 - it's going to increment by one okay so
23:31 - three
23:32 - well one plus one
23:39 - [Laughter]
23:41 - so it's going to be two right here okay
23:44 - okay i know so i said you've done the
23:46 - value of x but you kind of have to
23:47 - assume that the value backs at this
23:48 - point is kind of zero basically that's
23:50 - pretty much it
23:51 - so that's going to be that so x plus
23:53 - plus and what's going to happen
23:54 - every single time we're going to income
23:56 - at that basically one
23:57 - you know that's going to be two then
23:58 - it's gonna be three then four and five
24:00 - and six and then we're going to what
24:01 - we're going to print it out you see that
24:02 - right there this x right here in the
24:03 - console
24:04 - log that's going to be printed out okay
24:06 - so basically it will say the number of
24:08 - candies
24:08 - is zero then the number of candies is
24:12 - one then
24:15 - two and then it's going to go all the
24:17 - way till 15
24:20 - because when it's 15 it's going to say
24:22 - 15 here
24:24 - right and then it will increment to 16.
24:27 - okay you see but is 16 less than 15
24:32 - no no so we'll actually exit this loop
24:35 - out of this loop
24:36 - it will say stop and i will i will not
24:38 - do this anymore that's it
24:39 - okay understand beautiful do you guys
24:41 - understand
24:42 - yes no it's actually it's 15 guys it was
24:45 - 15.
24:46 - all right so kennedy's is 15 not 16.
24:48 - okay trust me i know that bill i
24:50 - know i don't know i think i partially
24:52 - built this one
24:54 - anyways guys so okay let's see the
24:56 - scoreboard who we got here
24:58 - a lot of you guys pick 16 that's
24:59 - interesting alright next one
25:03 - oh come on i got you beginner i got you
25:07 - i got you all right next one all right
25:10 - hold on hold on i'm gonna get ready
25:12 - which student is a point to nasa today
25:13 - according to console log i got this
25:16 - okay let's see on duty
25:21 - sorry instructors now sorry
25:28 - okay i see it okay got it done
25:35 - i have no clue whatsoever what's going
25:37 - on yeah yeah so this one is a hard one
25:40 - you kind of have to follow you kind of
25:42 - have to follow this
25:44 - thing about this so what is structure is
25:46 - a pointer to to nas right
25:48 - so you can see we have instructors this
25:50 - is variable instructors is an object see
25:52 - this object
25:54 - and the variable on duty here is not
25:56 - sorry so it's going to go to here
25:58 - right and then see the appointed
26:00 - instructor the student for this is going
26:02 - to be march cohort which is also a
26:03 - variable which is this one
26:05 - yeah yeah you see that and then it's
26:07 - going to go to students
26:08 - which is this one okay go back to the
26:11 - answer so i can answer
26:14 - okay hold on go all right let's see go
26:18 - go go go
26:25 - what do you think remember how you had
26:27 - to remember how we had that zero one two
26:29 - thing
26:30 - i know did you pick it yep yeah the
26:32 - right answer
26:33 - all right you think you picked the right
26:34 - answer yes do you guys think she picked
26:36 - the right answer what do you guys think
26:38 - give me a thumbs up if you think she
26:40 - picked the right answer give me a thumbs
26:41 - down if you think she picked the wrong
26:42 - answer
26:45 - [Laughter]
26:49 - yeah i think be funny
26:54 - what i don't know all right you guys
26:56 - have 10 seconds left because i'm going
26:57 - to give you 10 seconds not
26:59 - i give i give you way too much time here
27:01 - all right it's going to be 10
27:03 - 9 8 7
27:06 - 6
27:10 - 4 3 2
27:13 - 1 and we're done and
27:16 - we are i'm playing i'm pressing skip
27:18 - right now skip skip skip
27:20 - skip skip skip skip boom nice
27:23 - hey let's go you got it right
27:26 - that's what i'm talking about beautiful
27:28 - and i got a ride too actually so i'm
27:30 - gonna do this
27:31 - next come on
27:34 - beginner's still there i'm watching you
27:36 - beginner
27:40 - don't worry i see you
27:42 - [Music]
27:44 - i see you very closely all right correct
27:47 - correct right but
27:48 - with the way who's beginner in the
27:50 - comments guys who is beginner here in
27:51 - the comments i'm very curious i'm very
27:53 - curious who is here who is the beginner
27:54 - one here
27:55 - i'm very curious with the beginner
27:57 - person here all right
27:59 - all right next one we have let's go quiz
28:02 - good what language will be logged
28:06 - got it word
28:10 - kunichiwa got it
28:16 - got it what do you guys think
28:24 - what do you guys think you picked it
28:28 - yes yeah yeah
28:34 - all right you guys i will give you guys
28:35 - about 20 seconds ready
28:37 - 20 19 18
28:40 - 17 16 fifteen
28:44 - fourteen thirteen twelve
28:47 - eleven ten nine
28:50 - eight seven six
28:54 - hold on i'm gonna zoom in just for you
28:55 - guys so you can see it six
28:58 - five four
29:01 - three two
29:04 - one and i'm pressing on pressing on
29:08 - pressing i'm pressing i'm pressing
29:10 - pressing skip
29:12 - dawn it is japan oh damn she got it
29:15 - right
29:16 - dang it so let's let's talk about why
29:20 - that's the case right because i'm almost
29:22 - interested in explaining a little bit
29:23 - here right so let's think about why here
29:26 - again why because we're logging out
29:29 - something and we're calling the function
29:30 - say hello
29:31 - okay so guys so we'll have this function
29:33 - called say hello and this
29:35 - takes a parametrical greeting a
29:36 - parameter is like something you
29:37 - basically take a parameter you put into
29:38 - a function
29:39 - and so you can use that later on right
29:42 - basically i can pass in anything i want
29:44 - into this parameter
29:44 - you see what i mean a string a number
29:46 - whatever i want okay
29:48 - and then what's going to happen here is
29:49 - that this parameter
29:51 - then will look at this will be called
29:56 - another function of another call called
29:57 - get translation
29:59 - with that same parameter and so this is
30:02 - the function called cat translation
30:03 - and now this parameter biscuit just goes
30:05 - down the tree and is passed into here
30:07 - you see that
30:08 - okay and so now biscuit we have an if
30:10 - statement with an else if statement so
30:12 - if a word is hello
30:14 - return english if it's hollow dutch
30:19 - it is japanese said penis and what did
30:22 - we say
30:25 - that's funny actually when you said
30:27 - konichiwa you know how i know basic
30:29 - japanese
30:29 - oh yeah well
30:32 - that's how i figured it was japanese oh
30:34 - there you go so it's not program related
30:38 - language my knowledge of languages
30:42 - all right sure sure okay
30:46 - next one dammit this beginner guy is so
30:50 - good
30:52 - all right i'm coming up to you don't
30:53 - worry my friend alright so nas
30:55 - is right there but we have black
30:56 - dynamites coming up ariel's coming out i
30:58 - still don't see you on there
30:59 - yeah i'm like far behind because of the
31:02 - beginning
31:03 - yeah yeah yeah okay we have a well i
31:05 - think we have one more left guys do we
31:08 - one more left okay ready what answer
31:10 - makes victoria recursive function okay i
31:11 - got this
31:15 - uh got it
31:18 - [Music]
31:20 - done beginner coming from you i hope
31:23 - again everyone gets this one wrong
31:33 - you guys will have 20 seconds what do
31:35 - you think
31:37 - now do you know what do you know the
31:38 - recursive function no way
31:40 - a function a recursive function is a
31:42 - function that calls itself
31:43 - so it's like imagine like me putting a
31:46 - bottle inside another bottle
31:47 - yeah i was kind of looking at that or in
31:49 - the comments yeah so it's like
31:51 - it calls a function inside its own
31:52 - function basically and hopefully you
31:54 - guys can see that by the way
31:55 - [Music]
31:57 - right there go back to the answers
32:01 - there you go
32:04 - not lucky no
32:06 - [Laughter]
32:09 - i almost dropped the phone
32:12 - no you should pick something yes what'd
32:14 - you pick
32:15 - i'm not telling you right now
32:19 - since i have an answer dutch
32:22 - konichiwa konichiwa somebody said
32:26 - that's already in my mind beautiful well
32:28 - now let's put it to practice
32:30 - good good good good good good good good
32:36 - nice okay let's see let's see who won
32:39 - here let's see who won let's see let's
32:40 - see let's see let's see you know
32:41 - laugh at if beginner is kazi
32:45 - no cause this might not this should not
32:48 - be you
32:51 - he would do something like that he would
32:53 - do he would put himself
32:54 - uh he would do something like that i
32:56 - know it i i know it
32:57 - alright 10 seconds guys 10 9 8
33:00 - 7 6 5 4 3
33:04 - 2 1 and skip
33:09 - you got it right holy damn she had
33:11 - an answer streak of three
33:15 - what something
33:18 - [Laughter]
33:20 - that's funny so look so let's think
33:21 - about this guys the reason why it's
33:22 - factorial right because what is
33:24 - factorial factorial is basically
33:25 - five times four times three times three
33:27 - times one right so you're multiplying
33:29 - the number below it okay now in coding
33:32 - if we want to basically call a recursive
33:34 - function we have to call ourselves
33:36 - right and so let's say i do something
33:38 - like this if i do something like this
33:40 - let's just say that i do something like
33:43 - n
33:44 - uh n times basically
33:48 - let me see get factorial
33:53 - toward real of n
33:56 - minus one right what's going to happen
33:59 - here is very simple basically
34:02 - we're gonna have five here let's just
34:04 - say we initially start up with five
34:06 - then we're gonna call ourselves again
34:08 - right
34:10 - which is gonna call n times
34:13 - get factorial you see that and so this
34:16 - is gonna be now four
34:19 - you see that so now this five this guy
34:22 - factor
34:22 - gets replaced by four times itself
34:26 - get it and then this gets replaced and
34:29 - then by three because we're also
34:31 - always subtracting one until basically
34:34 - uh
34:34 - zero and then when zero then we start
34:36 - just stop
34:37 - understand so that's really cool guys
34:39 - you guys understand yes or no
34:40 - nice beautiful beautiful beautiful yeah
34:42 - i know something something to add an
34:44 - exit case i think it's the beginning bd
34:45 - is a beginner it helps i feel like
34:47 - that's that's the beginner
34:48 - yeah i feel as a beginner yeah anyways
34:50 - that's kind of it that's pretty much it
34:52 - from
34:52 - from from that point of view so let's
34:54 - see let's see who won
34:56 - this round guys ready are you ready
35:00 - yeah you ready i really hope we can did
35:02 - not win let's see podium all right let's
35:04 - go
35:05 - third place comes from snp let's go
35:08 - smp second place comes so
35:12 - i think i won i think i won watches
35:14 - someone else
35:20 - oh yeah ariel's fifth black diamond is
35:24 - fourth
35:25 - let's go beautiful beautiful beautiful
35:29 - that's what i am talking about somebody
35:31 - said please do quit do the quiz again
35:34 - we'll do that next time guys that was
35:36 - fun did you like it
35:37 - yeah i did like it that was fun right i
35:39 - thought was fun yeah these quiz are
35:40 - pretty cool
35:41 - i mean i have another bigger quiz but we
35:42 - can do that another time guys that's
35:44 - pretty much it guys from us

ahead and do this i will go ahead and bring you guys up to speed here for a second all right let's see so what we've got right now is we're gonna play a goal a game called kahoot anybody anybody played kahoot here if you have not let me know before you if you play the kahoot game that's a lot a lot of fun uh all right cool cool cool what do we have what do we have let me see let's see oh let's go we got 82 viewers right all right beautiful beautiful everybody say hello everybody say hi hi hi beautiful all right that's what i am talking about yes yes yes love from kansas shout out from pakistan beautiful all right so what we're going to do today is go through programming basis and i want you guys go ahead and take this out as well again it'll just be a fun one right with me as well because let me say nami beginner all right let's go so what we're going to do is i'm going to go play a game called classical it's probably basics so what i want you guys to do is it will go ahead and it will tell you to go to kahoot you guys see that kahoot so you go ahead and put that id and input this game pin nine one 915067 zero i'm going to do this two right now i'm going to this two let's see let's see let's see nine one five kahoot that is there we see yeah come on all right victoria you're there okay you guys can actually go there as well there we go i'm gonna be here so let's see all right let's see nine one five nine one five oh so look at siddharth let's go smp all right nine one five zero zero six seven beautiful i'm gonna enter as well i'm gonna put in my name it's nas okay go all right nice who else we're going to give you guys two more minutes you guys to log in okay so go ahead and take two minutes guys two minutes if you guys want to jean who's jean kale let's go beautiful oh this is gonna be fun it'll be so fun i know got nine people now 101 people live with us ali pratik all right who else guys i'll give you guys two beginners some you said ali all right beautiful beautiful 12 people now that's what i'm talking about that's what i'm talking about sod all right awesome sweet sweet sweet ariel wait ariel not the real do we know right [Laughter] absolute uni i'm not sure who that is but that's pretty funny all right let me see who else who else who else all right we'll go go ahead and get started right away in that case right now okay juan marielle who else ali beginner critique okay so bean man i think that's funny marine vlad vlad that sounds like a very uh you know european name i feel like oh okay all right i wish that can i remove some person wait there we go if you guys don't like it i will remove you there we go all right cool so program basic guys three two one so here's the question here okay how many bits are equal to one byte what do you guys think how many bits are equal to one but you guys have three seconds to answer all right let's go eight how many bits are equal to one bite wait i know this one what do you think you got it maybe maybe let's see all right let's see let's see let's see let's see 23 answers all right what do we have what do we have and we have a b it's equal to one but which one did you get yeah i was wrong all right so eight bits is equal to one byte guys that is what it is okay awesome let's go ahead again let's let me see who's the leader board here beginner wait did i not get it right oh cuz i took time so beginner is winning all right next one let's go next one what is the output of this what do you think wait wait don't look all right let's see ten answers eleven you guys have ten seconds ten nine eight seven six five four three two one oh it's lamb somebody's sad wait something you said right there do you know why you know why so the reason why is because let me go first show media so let's check this out the reason why that's the case is because in programming ooh that's interesting that was your drawing yeah that was interesting so the reason why guys is actually because in this is an array right here right this is the race as you guys potentially know right now to access an array what's going on here is we're console logging we're outputting something right and we're outputting you know the instructors at position two you see this two there's two right so now what did you think this actually means tell me this two means what do you think this two means uh the second one the second one so that's all that's a lot of people think right you'll be it'll be jess is that what you picked so the reason why it's actually not just is because in um in programming everything starts from zero yeah that's why i thought after i saw that the answer was uh lim uhhuh that's what i thought you thought it was yeah it was zero one two yeah yeah because right now the first the first index this is called index always starts from zero then we have one and then we have two right there exactly and that's kind of how it always kind of starts out in programming guys so just so you know okay somebody now i get it there we go beautiful beautiful yeah so that's really fun one right zero one two always remember this in programming everything starts from exactly z zero exactly all right let's go and continue on so that's the reason why we have this beautiful all right next one let's see uh okay all right you guys ready let's see who got the next chord oh is okay next one are you guys ready yes or no all right nas but something you said yes that's funny all right next one next all right i got this really quickly what is the output of the first and second answer okay quickly wait what okay okay i got it that's it yeah picked i don't know why i picked it picked such a long time 90 seconds huh i don't know i don't know why it's ah all right 12 answers guys who can do more don't give the answers out in the comments guys don't look you're trying to help me huh they're trying to help me no guys don't help her let's go come on come on what do you guys think what you guys think what you guys think huh have 156 people live holy moly let's go all right let's go all right and what do we have uh yeah i think so i'm gonna go ahead click uh can i if i click skip will they actually count oh no i don't know i think if they click skip it will actually count let me see skip oh which one did you pick that one that's the one you picked yeah really yep yeah look at that did you guys help her out no they did not okay they helped me out after okay all right so again the reason why let's go through this why this is happening right why is this happening guys well very simply okay i'll go stop this one i need to remove this portion right here from my side okay so the reason why this is happening is very simple right if you think about this right let's think about this right well we have console log z that's the output right so that means that's kind of what well it gets outputted right well let's think about this we have z is the variable and we have x is also variable here you see that now this variable the value of this variable is 10. yeah the value of this variable is basically x plus 5 which is 15. yeah so that's 15 is the first answer and then we have next one we have x equals 20 right and then z is equal to x plus five same thing 25 25. so it's pretty simple did you guys get that you guys understood that yes yes yes yes yes somebody said minha said there would be an error there yes there will be an error there i'm not sure where's the ear but the error i don't think there's an error here is there an error i don't think so anyway so that is the answer let's see who's the winner of this one and we have nasa's still on the running let's go let's go let's go now they're still in the running let's go okay but andy is coming up really quick look at this andy beginner pratik okay that's up where are you at i don't see you on there yeah i know all right next one what do you create well how do you create a function in javascript how do you create a function in javascript what do you guys think oh i gotta answer hold on otherwise i'll lose wait wait no come on we're connecting um okay i got it don't look i'm not yeah you are no i'm not yeah you are i'm not she's looking guys no yeah she is no okay let's see let's see let's see nope nope i put the comments up just look at the comments guys do not help other people well they just showed me that i'm wrong that's all i did all right let's see what you guys think what are you guessing all right let's see all right 21 you guys have 10 seconds left 10 seconds 10 nine eight seven six five four three two one and the answer is i was wrong that is the way they beat gohan and create a function is you call the first first you call at first you call function right first you call function and then after that you say the function name and then you put parentheses around it to give it that can biscuit to start a function and then you actually use brackets for that as well so that's how you do that awesome let's go and continue on beautiful all right next one is wait who's going to know oh i'm still not i'm still black dynamite is coming up though black diamond is almost there black diamond is almost there let's go black dynamite whoo beautiful all right next one you ready are you sure as ready as i'll ever be are you harmless already as ready as i'll ever be let's go all right next one and what does it mean if if true is returned what does it mean what does it mean if true is returned guys what do you guys think if true is returned okay i know this one oh i got this one i got this one are you looking at me don't look that's the wrong answer did you already pick it no good well thank you for that so this by the way just so you guys know the module is here this month so this module is right here okay guys if you're spamming i'm gonna cut you out right now all right let me see where's this guy if you're spamming oh i enjoy i enjoy this right here so much there we go beautiful so guys so just so you know right what does this module mean this right here this modulus means that a number can be divided by two equal like if a number could be divided by two what does that mean what does it mean if a number can always be divided by two even exactly so it's this one right hand that's what i chose really yeah let's go hey let's go that's not an easy one yeah well i just figured because of math all right let's go somebody said 15 25. that does not that's not the answer guys all right there we go next one wow a lot of you guys did that holy moly i'm surprised so like i said guys the reason why this is the answer is very simply because why i modules 2 right here means that a number can be divided by 2 evenly right modulus means modulus actually is an operator that means basically how much something is left that's what that means so basically like if i do five modulus two the answer for that will be one because the remainder from that is one because four divided by two is even right so it'll be two times two and then the remainder of that will be one understand yeah awesome sweet so let's continue on let's go all right wait all right okay next one and we have oh nas is still in the winding let's go i need to get myself all right oh come on you know you gotta have some fun sometimes you know i know how else are you very far behind wait you just told us the answer i did not tell you guys the answer i never told you guys the answer did i tell you guys the answer no no i didn't tell you no all right next one next up what is and and end wait i actually don't know this one hold on wait no i got it what is it guys what do you guys think is it i might have gotten this one wrong actually hold on because i forgot the name actually do you remember from like code academy really yeah your mom with this one because i forgot to recognize it i know i mean i know what it is i know i know what it does but i think i got it wrong oh man yeah i got it wrong damn it hmm don't tell the answer valeria says don't tell the answer guys all right guys and how do we have 26 answers 27 answers since one day more people come into here logic go let's go oh let's go all right and we're done and ten nine eight seven six five quattro uno oh it's a logical operator i put down conditional operator for some reason i don't know the comparison the comparison operator that's that's a pretty good choice too dang it i don't know i thought it was because it's inside a conditional see even a pro developer sometimes we'll get we'll get messed up yeah that's okay all right mistakes happen yeah why this guy be so annoying i don't know if i'm annoyed then just you know then move away from this youtube channel from this youtube video oh no oh no but again i'm coming for you my friend i am coming for you my friend he's not a beginner he's not a beginner no he's a beginner just you know but i'm worried i come i got you i got you don't worry i got you i got you all right next one i got this one what kind of a loop is this and what is the maximum number of candies i got it okay oh got it all right not so sure got it what do you think not so sure but why not i'm trying what is what do you think it is like i recognize that from like from kota candy right yeah but at the same time i'm not sure i just remember it's like seeing it yeah yeah so like what do you think is happening here i'm curious uh well it's greater than or equal to but it says what kind of loop is this and then the maximum number of candies okay so it has to be more than 15 but um well it's less than this is less than there's actually x is less than equal to you see that right there so so what happens here is this x actually less than or equal to 15 right so this variable has to be smaller see this right here this bracket means smaller than 15 right here because if it's otherwise if i want to be greater that means i have to do x greater than 15 right here right there that's kind of how that would be yeah yeah yeah it's hard sometimes you can mess up sometimes that's yeah it's hard to do that once though sometimes yeah no i don't know actually do you know i don't know i don't know actually okay awesome so let's go and continue on awesome so we got that one that's fun so we got ten nine six five four three two one which one is it one is it i got it i got this one i got this one right i got this one right this one right oh let's go hold on make that face again which one did you pick the blue one the blue water what'd you put i mean you're not far it's a while loop you know yeah [Laughter] so the reason guys why we have that it's a do while loop right and if you think about this it's not a while loop so while loop will actually have the while on this right here will actually be on the top so when if you do that then that's called a while loop okay hi everyone hi everyone good good so that's called the while loop so that's on the top right here you see that yeah but because we started with do we do say do and then while something's happening so while something is true so basically do this functionality while something right here is true well what can i say well something is true and the reason why it's 15 and not 16 is what do you think guys the reason why it's 15 not 16 is because it's very simple here think about this so it starts off with zero so x usually starts off with zero so we're going to start out with zero initially kind of like this right and then what's going to happen is we're going to what is it what do you think is x plus plus means i don't know so this means increment right this must increment so for example if we have if x is equal to one right now right is equal to one right now right if i do x plus plus it's gonna be equal to you tell me so so if i do x plus plus it's going to increment by one okay so three well one plus one [Laughter] so it's going to be two right here okay okay i know so i said you've done the value of x but you kind of have to assume that the value backs at this point is kind of zero basically that's pretty much it so that's going to be that so x plus plus and what's going to happen every single time we're going to income at that basically one you know that's going to be two then it's gonna be three then four and five and six and then we're going to what we're going to print it out you see that right there this x right here in the console log that's going to be printed out okay so basically it will say the number of candies is zero then the number of candies is one then two and then it's going to go all the way till 15 because when it's 15 it's going to say 15 here right and then it will increment to 16. okay you see but is 16 less than 15 no no so we'll actually exit this loop out of this loop it will say stop and i will i will not do this anymore that's it okay understand beautiful do you guys understand yes no it's actually it's 15 guys it was 15. all right so kennedy's is 15 not 16. okay trust me i know that bill i know i don't know i think i partially built this one anyways guys so okay let's see the scoreboard who we got here a lot of you guys pick 16 that's interesting alright next one oh come on i got you beginner i got you i got you all right next one all right hold on hold on i'm gonna get ready which student is a point to nasa today according to console log i got this okay let's see on duty sorry instructors now sorry okay i see it okay got it done i have no clue whatsoever what's going on yeah yeah so this one is a hard one you kind of have to follow you kind of have to follow this thing about this so what is structure is a pointer to to nas right so you can see we have instructors this is variable instructors is an object see this object and the variable on duty here is not sorry so it's going to go to here right and then see the appointed instructor the student for this is going to be march cohort which is also a variable which is this one yeah yeah you see that and then it's going to go to students which is this one okay go back to the answer so i can answer okay hold on go all right let's see go go go go what do you think remember how you had to remember how we had that zero one two thing i know did you pick it yep yeah the right answer all right you think you picked the right answer yes do you guys think she picked the right answer what do you guys think give me a thumbs up if you think she picked the right answer give me a thumbs down if you think she picked the wrong answer [Laughter] yeah i think be funny what i don't know all right you guys have 10 seconds left because i'm going to give you 10 seconds not i give i give you way too much time here all right it's going to be 10 9 8 7 6 4 3 2 1 and we're done and we are i'm playing i'm pressing skip right now skip skip skip skip skip skip skip boom nice hey let's go you got it right that's what i'm talking about beautiful and i got a ride too actually so i'm gonna do this next come on beginner's still there i'm watching you beginner don't worry i see you i see you very closely all right correct correct right but with the way who's beginner in the comments guys who is beginner here in the comments i'm very curious i'm very curious who is here who is the beginner one here i'm very curious with the beginner person here all right all right next one we have let's go quiz good what language will be logged got it word kunichiwa got it got it what do you guys think what do you guys think you picked it yes yeah yeah all right you guys i will give you guys about 20 seconds ready 20 19 18 17 16 fifteen fourteen thirteen twelve eleven ten nine eight seven six hold on i'm gonna zoom in just for you guys so you can see it six five four three two one and i'm pressing on pressing on pressing i'm pressing i'm pressing pressing skip dawn it is japan oh damn she got it right dang it so let's let's talk about why that's the case right because i'm almost interested in explaining a little bit here right so let's think about why here again why because we're logging out something and we're calling the function say hello okay so guys so we'll have this function called say hello and this takes a parametrical greeting a parameter is like something you basically take a parameter you put into a function and so you can use that later on right basically i can pass in anything i want into this parameter you see what i mean a string a number whatever i want okay and then what's going to happen here is that this parameter then will look at this will be called another function of another call called get translation with that same parameter and so this is the function called cat translation and now this parameter biscuit just goes down the tree and is passed into here you see that okay and so now biscuit we have an if statement with an else if statement so if a word is hello return english if it's hollow dutch it is japanese said penis and what did we say that's funny actually when you said konichiwa you know how i know basic japanese oh yeah well that's how i figured it was japanese oh there you go so it's not program related language my knowledge of languages all right sure sure okay next one dammit this beginner guy is so good all right i'm coming up to you don't worry my friend alright so nas is right there but we have black dynamites coming up ariel's coming out i still don't see you on there yeah i'm like far behind because of the beginning yeah yeah yeah okay we have a well i think we have one more left guys do we one more left okay ready what answer makes victoria recursive function okay i got this uh got it done beginner coming from you i hope again everyone gets this one wrong you guys will have 20 seconds what do you think now do you know what do you know the recursive function no way a function a recursive function is a function that calls itself so it's like imagine like me putting a bottle inside another bottle yeah i was kind of looking at that or in the comments yeah so it's like it calls a function inside its own function basically and hopefully you guys can see that by the way right there go back to the answers there you go not lucky no [Laughter] i almost dropped the phone no you should pick something yes what'd you pick i'm not telling you right now since i have an answer dutch konichiwa konichiwa somebody said that's already in my mind beautiful well now let's put it to practice good good good good good good good good nice okay let's see let's see who won here let's see who won let's see let's see let's see let's see you know laugh at if beginner is kazi no cause this might not this should not be you he would do something like that he would do he would put himself uh he would do something like that i know it i i know it alright 10 seconds guys 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 and skip you got it right holy damn she had an answer streak of three what something [Laughter] that's funny so look so let's think about this guys the reason why it's factorial right because what is factorial factorial is basically five times four times three times three times one right so you're multiplying the number below it okay now in coding if we want to basically call a recursive function we have to call ourselves right and so let's say i do something like this if i do something like this let's just say that i do something like n uh n times basically let me see get factorial toward real of n minus one right what's going to happen here is very simple basically we're gonna have five here let's just say we initially start up with five then we're gonna call ourselves again right which is gonna call n times get factorial you see that and so this is gonna be now four you see that so now this five this guy factor gets replaced by four times itself get it and then this gets replaced and then by three because we're also always subtracting one until basically uh zero and then when zero then we start just stop understand so that's really cool guys you guys understand yes or no nice beautiful beautiful beautiful yeah i know something something to add an exit case i think it's the beginning bd is a beginner it helps i feel like that's that's the beginner yeah i feel as a beginner yeah anyways that's kind of it that's pretty much it from from from that point of view so let's see let's see who won this round guys ready are you ready yeah you ready i really hope we can did not win let's see podium all right let's go third place comes from snp let's go smp second place comes so i think i won i think i won watches someone else oh yeah ariel's fifth black diamond is fourth let's go beautiful beautiful beautiful that's what i am talking about somebody said please do quit do the quiz again we'll do that next time guys that was fun did you like it yeah i did like it that was fun right i thought was fun yeah these quiz are pretty cool i mean i have another bigger quiz but we can do that another time guys that's pretty much it guys from us that's from me um so yeah let me know what you guys think how was it how was it yeah i liked it yeah you liked it you had a lot of fun yeah yeah yeah that's all that's a cool way to learn i feel i feel like yeah definitely yeah yeah so guys let me see what are some of the accounts you guys we have on here got three minus three it was all planned i mean beginner was always be second from the beginning let's go let's go let's see what else there's a yellow awesome guys you have any questions for me do you have any questions for me i think we're all good questions on here that's pretty much it guys um well this was fun this was me nas and victoria victoria it was a lot of fun with you guys we had a lot of fun with just you know playing some games and so forth like that we'll definitely be back with some more at some point and uh we'll test you out and make sure you guys are learning learning some good stuff okay um always guys we're doing this podcast just so you know always doing this podcast every single we're going to try to do everything every single day um here on clever programmer right if you have any topics you want us to go over let us know definitely we'll go over those topics okay just so you know and there's some specific you want us to cover let me know as well uh go ahead and tag me on instagram at nas dominsky and cleverkazy if you want to let us know about those topics as well other than that guys that's cute other than that guys it has been fun it's been really fun hope you guys had uh have a great day hope you guys have a have an amazing uh weekend weekend no this is sunday it's a sunday it's a sunday hope you guys have a great sunday i will see you guys in the next video let's go ready yeah let's go all right guys i'll see you later
