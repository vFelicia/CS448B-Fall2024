00:00 - how's it going this is qazi from
00:03 - cleverprogrammer.com welcome
00:06 - to how to make money as
00:09 - a freelance developer and how to make a
00:13 - thousand dollars or more
00:15 - this upcoming month now this is part two
00:18 - and day two of the challenge and we're
00:20 - gonna keep this
00:21 - rocking and rolling for you guys
00:25 - this is about a freelance movement that
00:28 - we're trying to create and we want you
00:30 - all to be a part of it
00:31 - you're not too late and nobody's
00:32 - beginner or too advanced for this
00:35 - you're all you all can be in this
00:37 - together and
00:38 - the entire goal of this movement and it
00:41 - kind of came to me randomly is
00:43 - the goal of this movement is for us to
00:45 - like we want to get to that long-term
00:47 - goal right
00:49 - we all want to get to that like crazy
00:52 - long-term goal that we have
00:53 - of man i wish i could be making this
00:56 - much money or i could be doing
00:58 - this amazing life the goal of this
01:00 - challenge is to take those first steps
01:02 - towards it
01:03 - because oftentimes the steps here are
01:06 - missing and never revealed
01:08 - and it's just like yeah here's how you
01:09 - can make ten thousand dollars a month or
01:11 - something crazy
01:12 - like that but i i care about some of you
01:15 - making your first five dollars
01:17 - this week i care about some of you maybe
01:19 - making your first
01:20 - um fifty dollars this week or
01:24 - five hundred dollars whatever it is for
01:26 - you right
01:27 - that would be super exciting and that's
01:30 - the movement we're creating
01:31 - how can we all increase our income and
01:34 - my focus came on this because i started
01:36 - focusing on increasing my income because
01:38 - i'm like look i'm
01:39 - focusing on all my other goals
01:41 - relationship goals and
01:43 - fitness goals and i'm focusing on team
01:45 - development goals and we have an amazing
01:46 - team with sunny and nas and
01:48 - rishi and yusuf and david and amanath
01:50 - and frankie and aaron
01:52 - we're bringing so much value that's
01:55 - great
01:55 - so content goals are being crushed body
01:58 - goals are being crushed
01:59 - nutrition goals food goals sleep goals
02:01 - health goals
02:02 - but what about my income goals somewhere
02:05 - along the line i felt like i forgot that
02:07 - and that's important
02:08 - for me to keep increasing and i thought
02:10 - why not we all create a movement where
02:13 - we're in it together
02:14 - increasing all of our income does that
02:17 - make sense guys
02:18 - and i hope that that's also exciting to
02:20 - you and welcome everybody
02:22 - that is here man am i pumped to have you
02:24 - guys on here and if you guys can do me a
02:26 - favor
02:27 - and get this video out to as many people
02:28 - as possible just go ahead and smash that
02:31 - like button
02:32 - just break it you know click it maybe a
02:34 - few times but really smash that like
02:36 - button it would do me a huge favor and
02:38 - get this video out to other people and
02:39 - then it will help
02:40 - also transform their lives as well and
02:43 - it's free doesn't cost anything all
02:45 - right
02:45 - with that said let's just jump right
02:47 - into it so amazing let's go here so now
02:50 - right now
02:51 - some far less qualified people than you
02:54 - are living your dreams all because they
02:57 - didn't just talk about it
02:58 - they took action
03:02 - i want you to remember that and i wanna
03:05 - uh
03:05 - show you a few rockstar action takers
03:08 - that are here
03:09 - and part of clever programmer
03:12 - and when that grind payoff baby we show
03:15 - off
03:16 - so it's okay to show off when you put in
03:19 - the hard work all right
03:20 - bragging hard is not a crime
03:24 - here is uh nasir who's actually
03:28 - my 14 year old student and he cleared
03:31 - nine hundred dollars
03:32 - in just one week all right he
03:35 - what's an insane and he actually reached
03:37 - out to me on instagram
03:39 - uh yesterday and he's actually in
03:41 - pakistan okay he's not even in the
03:43 - united states
03:44 - so this is equivalent of somebody making
03:46 - like 9 000
03:47 - in u.s that's that's how big of a deal
03:50 - that is
03:51 - people make 900 in like six months in
03:54 - pakistan
03:55 - so if he can do it
03:59 - my question is can you also do something
04:02 - can you
04:02 - also make progress can you also make
04:04 - some amount of income even if it's not
04:06 - 900
04:08 - it's a lot of it is a thing that is in
04:11 - our
04:12 - mind and it kind of blocks us what is up
04:15 - everybody welcome here srikar
04:17 - says he got an internship that's amazing
04:20 - guys whatever
04:20 - you're getting or whatever is happening
04:23 - please make sure
04:24 - that you keep sharing proof of it and
04:27 - you can do
04:28 - it on my instagram you can my instagram
04:31 - is right here
04:32 - so you can actually share with me and
04:35 - we're
04:35 - compiling a document with everybody's
04:37 - results and everybody's wins and how
04:39 - much income everybody's making
04:40 - so far we have over two thousand dollars
04:43 - made
04:44 - that that is documented so far so two
04:47 - thousand dollars have
04:48 - already been made we just started this
04:50 - movement yesterday
04:52 - granted we're taking some of the people
04:54 - who got income from a week before that
04:56 - but that's okay
04:58 - any document income we're gonna we're
05:00 - gonna document it
05:01 - so we're right now at about two thousand
05:03 - dollars and we wanna get to
05:05 - ten thousand and more all right and
05:08 - we're gonna
05:08 - show off every single person who's
05:10 - making income even if it's
05:12 - not as much or you think it's not as
05:13 - impressive
05:15 - um srikar says he sent me proof at my
05:18 - ig okay let's take a look
05:22 - so let's go here let's record

05:52 - right uh regarding yesterday's live
05:55 - stream
05:56 - here's what one of the students had to
05:58 - say schloke
05:59 - and he said regarding so he goes hey man
06:02 - just saw your last video on youtube that
06:04 - said
06:04 - how to earn 1 000 as a freelance
06:06 - developer in 30 days
06:08 - just can't be thankful enough for the
06:09 - value you've provided
06:11 - i would say you just hit the right cords
06:14 - talking about myself
06:15 - i'm a javascript developer having
06:17 - experience of around three years now
06:20 - so to speak for the last 45 days my
06:22 - income has been
06:23 - zero all right so for how many people
06:27 - is this happening where you have some
06:28 - experience and is this
06:30 - you by the way if some of you resonate
06:32 - with what you read so far drop it in the
06:34 - comments below but
06:35 - do you feel like you are coding or
06:38 - learning coding maybe for the last few
06:40 - months or last few years but you really
06:44 - haven't made any income from it maybe
06:46 - you just get caught up with tutorial
06:48 - after tutorial or project after project
06:50 - but no real results with it and he goes
06:54 - i'm pretty confident that i'm going to
06:55 - add value to this challenge and make the
06:57 - best out of it that's a great attitude
07:03 - yep ido city says my guy talk back to me
07:08 - what's up bro all right
07:11 - and i'll add here
07:15 - nice dude i want to be that guy
07:18 - nice
07:21 - okay now i can start showing people's
07:24 - comments as well
07:25 - and he goes i'm sure of sharing income
07:28 - proof as i make progress in coming days
07:30 - so you guys can share proof as well
07:32 - and i've recently asked a question on my
07:34 - g story which no one really gave the
07:35 - answer i was expecting the question you
07:37 - asked what is the best thing money can
07:38 - buy
07:39 - this is exactly what you spotted in the
07:41 - video freedom
07:43 - um basically in the video i said money
07:45 - can buy freedom and that's the ultimate
07:47 - thing that i want with money
07:49 - he goes literally what i'm striving for
07:51 - right now thank you so much for bringing
07:53 - this straight
07:54 - to us love you man awesome
08:00 - okay
08:04 - jennifer stewart says fiverr is a ripoff
08:08 - it really depends what you're doing with
08:10 - it
08:12 - if you don't use it in the right way i
08:14 - mean most of these
08:15 - websites can have that effect right
08:17 - including craigslist obviously so you
08:19 - have to kind of
08:20 - don't give up on it there are people
08:22 - making literally millions of dollars on
08:25 - fiverr it's just a matter of avoiding
08:27 - the quote-unquote rip-off situations
08:30 - right and you get
08:31 - seasoned as you as you do it more
08:34 - uh here's another student that shared
08:36 - with me muhammad
08:38 - shared with me yesterday and he said i
08:39 - didn't register in your course bro but i
08:41 - did follow your tutorials they're
08:42 - amazing
08:43 - after learning react and django through
08:45 - your tutorials
08:46 - i made 1200 since august
08:49 - thanks to you i'm making 400 pretty much
08:53 - every 20 days which is good enough for
08:55 - at my place
08:56 - and again another student in pakistan so
08:58 - that's
08:59 - a lot of income so look at this he made
09:01 - over 1200
09:02 - and making 400 every month in pakistan
09:05 - right that is
09:06 - absolutely brilliant
09:10 - vanguard said i made 300 in a week by a
09:14 - simple react single page application on
09:17 - fiverr
09:18 - boom there you go that's amazing to hear
09:21 - that just made my day that's awesome
09:25 - and that's the movement we're starting
09:27 - regardless of what your level is i want
09:29 - you to
09:30 - start applying now and start doing
09:33 - things now and building habits
09:34 - now that start making you some amount of
09:37 - income and set your goal to making
09:38 - five dollars this week because that
09:41 - small goal will move you in the right
09:43 - direction
09:44 - for example when you put on your running
09:45 - shoes you don't have to be an amazing
09:47 - person
09:48 - it will just propel you to start getting
09:50 - out of your house to then
09:51 - start running even if you run for 30
09:53 - seconds
09:54 - right so if you set your goal to
09:56 - something small it'll now start moving
09:57 - in the direction to start wanting to do
09:59 - it
10:01 - absolutely great job that's awesome
10:04 - vanguard um share that with us on
10:08 - instagram as well please that will be
10:10 - amazing

11:25 - super cool to see you guys coding and

11:50 - talking about
11:51 - hey this is cool you can actually see
11:53 - the youtube
11:55 - stats and how they're doing so generally
11:57 - when
11:58 - the viewership is going down you know we
12:01 - we know oh
12:02 - crap something bad is happening like
12:03 - what just happened here just drop maybe

12:46 - point of what we do and teach and share
12:50 - at clever programmer and so
12:53 - what i want to do is share with you guys
12:55 - what are the things that are really
12:56 - working for me right now that are
12:58 - helping me improve
13:00 - my body that are helping me optimize my
13:03 - mind
13:04 - that are helping me generate sales and
13:07 - increase my
13:07 - income and helping me crush it with all
13:10 - types of goals so i'm going to share
13:12 - with you guys
13:13 - my day and i do these reflections on my
13:15 - instagram every single
13:17 - day so if you guys ever follow me you
13:19 - will be able to see these reflections
13:20 - but i want to share this with you
13:22 - because my goal is i don't know what's
13:25 - going to happen with the
13:27 - you know there are 193 people watching
13:29 - right now and they're probably going to
13:30 - be thousands of people watching
13:31 - afterwards
13:32 - i don't know what's going to happen with
13:33 - all of them but if there's just one
13:35 - person that can get a transformation out
13:37 - of it or that starts picking up one of
13:38 - these things
13:39 - i think your life is going to improve
13:41 - and that is what excites me and
13:43 - motivates me to do these things
13:44 - and what really excites me is when you
13:46 - guys share with me that you guys are
13:48 - actually doing some of these things and
13:49 - it's helping you
13:51 - all right so i'm gonna now share the
13:54 - screen and we're gonna get to it yo
13:56 - rudolph he says yes yes and yes amazing
13:58 - thomas says
13:59 - yes awesome absolutely matthias texas
14:04 - yes
14:04 - code ninja yes again again
14:07 - beautiful sabir says heck yeah man i
14:10 - love your guys's energy
14:12 - guys we're definitely gonna get on calls
14:14 - uh on this
14:16 - live stream okay so here we go
14:20 - so here is my full work day
14:23 - full day yesterday okay um so
14:27 - i worked out that's the first thing i
14:29 - started my day off with because that's
14:30 - the one thing
14:31 - guaranteed that's going to help move my
14:33 - life forward every single day
14:35 - forever okay so that's something i start
14:38 - my day off with so then i have good
14:40 - momentum
14:43 - next up i had really good
14:46 - food uh consumption yesterday so i'm
14:48 - trying to get my protein up to 120 or
14:50 - 150 grams per day
14:52 - so i ate a lot of good food so whether
14:55 - it was like chicken breasts or
14:58 - protein shakes or salmon whatever it is
15:02 - that i can help
15:03 - fuel and optimize my body now why i say
15:06 - this stuff is important and why i'm even
15:07 - sharing this with you
15:08 - is you're probably sitting there
15:11 - thinking
15:12 - what does food have to do with coding
15:15 - what does food have to do with
15:16 - development well let me tell you
15:18 - something
15:19 - i used to code for long stretches of 13
15:22 - to 15 hours a day
15:23 - that's why i got so good at coding in
15:25 - such a short amount of time
15:27 - and that's why i was making a hundred
15:29 - thousand dollars a year
15:30 - just six months into my coding
15:32 - experience
15:34 - but what i did that was really bad is i
15:36 - pretty much starve myself the entire
15:38 - time
15:38 - because what would happen when i would
15:41 - eat food is
15:42 - right after i would eat food i would
15:44 - just feel completely sluggish
15:46 - tired and all i would want to do is
15:49 - sleep
15:50 - if you resonate with that drop that in
15:52 - the comments below if you ever feel that
15:53 - where you eat food
15:54 - and then you all you kind of just want
15:55 - to do is just like lay down
15:57 - relax sleep but you don't have the
15:59 - willpower to do crazy things anymore
16:02 - well here's actually what it is
16:05 - when you are hungry and you don't
16:08 - actually eat food for a long period of
16:09 - time
16:09 - literally why your brain is so active is
16:12 - because it's
16:13 - genuinely searching for food so your
16:16 - brain stays sharp when your brain is
16:18 - sharp you can problem solve you can
16:20 - build that project for your client you
16:22 - can um
16:24 - get that job or pass that interview that
16:26 - you were working really hard for does
16:28 - that make sense
16:29 - so people are like yeah how do you get
16:32 - so much
16:33 - how do you even code if you're hungry
16:34 - and not focused so i'm going to answer
16:36 - all these things these are great
16:37 - questions and comments you guys
16:38 - say it says yep it happens to me
16:43 - nice okay
16:47 - nice so here's the thing
16:51 - if you don't know what you're doing with
16:55 - food it's going to actually destroy your
16:57 - productivity and it's going to destroy
16:59 - your income
17:00 - i'm not kidding so what you have
17:03 - to do
17:04 - is either one just avoid food at all
17:06 - costs that's what i started doing but
17:08 - then i started starving myself and
17:09 - started becoming scrawny and i didn't
17:11 - want to be surrounding i want to be
17:12 -  jacked
17:13 - i want to be like you know i want to be
17:15 - big and i want to be strong and i want
17:16 - to be healthy
17:18 - so i can be there for my family and my
17:20 - teammates and whatever
17:21 - the case may be right whatever situation
17:23 - i'm in
17:25 - so when it comes to food what i've
17:28 - started doing is i'm now eating
17:30 - lower calories and i'm eating i'm mainly
17:34 - what i'm doing is i'm reducing my carbs
17:36 - and maximizing my protein intake so all
17:39 - that means is i'm from a culture
17:41 - i'm from pakistan right so my family
17:44 - ate a lot of bread and naan and roti and
17:48 - stuff
17:49 - that stuff is so carb loaded that it
17:52 - will
17:53 - mess you up like it makes you want to
17:54 - sleep it's the best food on the planet
17:56 - and like there's no better food than
17:57 - that
17:58 - but all you want to do is just like
18:00 - sleep
18:01 - so what i started doing is i've started
18:04 - cutting a lot of that out so i can just
18:05 - have
18:06 - chicken breasts but without the bread i
18:09 - i
18:10 - just have you know salmon but without
18:13 - really any
18:14 - bread or anything like that without any
18:15 - white rice
18:17 - that what it does is i can now eat and
18:20 - stay healthy
18:22 - but my focus is for very long periods of
18:25 - time so i can actually focus for eight
18:26 - to ten hours a day if i wanted to
18:29 - so i did want to mention that and make
18:31 - it a point because i think that
18:33 - if you guys just made that little tiny
18:35 - switch
18:36 - and what you do it's gonna help you
18:39 - so freaking much all right ahmed is like
18:42 - biryani man biryani is tasty i know bro
18:45 - but
18:45 - that is awesome and amazing but
18:48 - it's gonna you up so that's why i
18:50 - mention it
18:51 - um yeah somebody said sugar shaw effect
18:55 - yeah my girlfriend is
18:56 - into fitness so she helped me as well
18:58 - with this so yeah so
19:00 - i would reduce the carbs like crazy
19:02 - right like right now i'm drinking just
19:04 - pure black coffee
19:05 - and it's absolutely amazing you can't
19:07 - really see it but it's just black coffee
19:11 - um reduce the carb reduce the calories
19:13 - in your day
19:14 - you're going to feel so damn good and
19:16 - you're going to be energized
19:17 - and your income will thank you so wanted
19:20 - to make that a point
19:22 - next up i'm not going to talk too much
19:23 - about this but i have increased my water
19:26 - intake so i always make sure that i'm
19:28 - consistently drinking water throughout
19:30 - the day
19:30 - and then i have my apple watch and i
19:32 - track my water with that it's super easy
19:34 - i just click one button and then i click
19:35 - one button the app is called
19:37 - waterminder so really amazing app
19:40 - but water intake helped me so moving
19:43 - forward
19:44 - i shot my video most of you don't give a
19:45 -  about that so that's fine i'm just
19:47 - gonna move past this but this is helpful
19:49 - for
19:49 - me building my brand and me
19:52 - increasing moving towards my goals it's
19:54 - important for me
19:56 - right for you it might be you need to
19:57 - code um
19:59 - for 30 minutes or an hour every day and
20:01 - make it a thing
20:03 - i did the youtube video yesterday and it
20:06 - crushed you guys seemed to love it we
20:07 - got over 10 000 views it provided a ton
20:10 - of value for people so i was happy
20:11 - now here's the other thing that you guys
20:13 - will actually care about
20:15 - um i closed the sale for about 1200
20:18 - cash yesterday using the phone
20:22 - at about 5 33 p.m now let me ask you
20:26 - guys
20:28 - would you guys be happy if in one day
20:31 - you were able to make twelve hundred
20:32 - dollars
20:34 - in 30 minutes
20:43 - aditya says i was also eating good and
20:45 - working out but then covet happened yes
20:47 - that's exactly what happened to me and
20:48 - it threw me out of the loop
20:49 - but you can't i know you know this but
20:53 - you can't let this be
20:54 - an excuse because it's gonna hurt you
20:56 - from your goals
20:58 - and it's gonna make you a worse person
21:00 - than you are now so you can
21:02 - blame it as much as you want but it's
21:04 - really not going to help you aditya move
21:06 - forward in your life so
21:08 - it was the thing that was stopping me
21:09 - and me up so i
21:11 - hate not doing anything but lifting so i
21:13 - just stopped doing anything but then i
21:15 - started doing a push-up program because
21:17 - i'm like that you can do without weights
21:19 - and um you can still eat healthy food so
21:23 - avoid that from becoming an excuse
21:25 - because it was mine for this entire year
21:27 - and i got fat
21:28 - i gotta start getting fat started
21:30 - getting unhealthy
21:31 - and irritated and angry and yeah all
21:34 - kinds of things that are that are not
21:35 - good
21:38 - all right people are like yeah of course
21:40 - that would i would be the happiest ever
21:42 - right
21:42 - awesome so how did that happen
21:45 - i developed a simple habit of getting on
21:48 - one sales call per day now this twelve
21:50 - hundred dollars is really thirty six
21:52 - hundred dollars because it's a three
21:53 - month payment plan that i close somebody
21:54 - for right
21:56 - that they enrolled in one of our
21:58 - programs but i had to manually get on a
22:00 - call
22:02 - and see what this person needed and if
22:05 - what they need if we couldn't help them
22:07 - with what they need then i would be like
22:08 - okay we don't have anything that's good
22:10 - for you
22:10 - but if it was something that we could
22:12 - help them with then i said hey yes we do
22:14 - have a program and then they would have
22:15 - to make a decision at that point to say
22:17 - yes or no to my services does that make
22:19 - sense guys
22:20 - so for you what that would look like is
22:24 - if you have a service like you can help
22:26 - somebody learn how to code
22:27 - or if you can help build something
22:31 - for somebody with code then you would
22:34 - get on a call and you would have a 20 to
22:36 - 30 minutes
22:37 - exchange of words you would exchange
22:39 - words with them
22:40 - like ask them a question listen ask them
22:43 - a question
22:44 - listen ask them a question listen and
22:45 - then 30 minutes in you'd be like hey
22:48 - i have something for you that might be
22:51 - able to help you
22:55 - are you interested in hearing more
22:57 - they're like yes then you go okay
22:59 - well i have a 30 day 60 day 90 day
23:03 - mentorship program where i'll teach you
23:05 - how to code and improve your skills
23:09 - this is how much it's gonna cost you
23:10 - could have it be three hundred dollars
23:12 - hundred dollars fifty dollars it doesn't
23:14 - matter
23:14 - you could have it be three thousand or
23:16 - four thousand dollars right
23:19 - that's that's what i'm doing so you
23:21 - could have it be that
23:22 - and if the person sees value in it then
23:24 - it's their decision whether they want to
23:26 - say yes or no you're not holding anybody
23:28 - to a gun point
23:29 - you are having a genuine conversation
23:32 - and then you're saying hey i think we
23:33 - have something for you
23:35 - do you want it yes or no and then it's
23:37 - just their decision
23:39 - but what i can control on my end in
23:42 - order to improve my income is i can just
23:43 - develop a good
23:45 - habit to focus on cash and income and
23:48 - sales generating strategies does that
23:50 - make sense
23:51 - so this is why it all comes down to
23:53 - habits right
23:54 - if you want to improve your body good
23:56 - water good food
23:57 - good exercise habits right these three
24:00 - habits will improve your health you guys
24:01 - agree with me or disagree
24:04 - right when it comes to improving your
24:08 - income
24:08 - if you can get on a sales call every
24:10 - single day
24:12 - just one it's going to improve your
24:14 - income does that make sense
24:22 - awesome nikhil says agreed sir car says
24:26 - yes
24:28 - yep you can blame the tides or you can
24:30 - go
24:31 - with them right totally agree with you
24:33 - totally agree
24:35 - cool yes garveet i do listen to audible
24:38 - quite a bit
24:40 - yep okay so
24:44 - uh and and uh any mods please just go
24:47 - ahead and
24:48 - block anybody that's um
24:52 - that's just saying dumb like keep
24:55 - the chat clean
24:56 - otherwise we're just gonna block you
24:58 - from the chat so
25:00 - that is important all right so this is a
25:02 - habit that you guys can develop too
25:04 - maybe you guys can develop a habit of
25:07 - hey
25:07 - i'm gonna do a few outreaches every
25:10 - single day two to three outreaches every
25:11 - single day it could be tiny
25:14 - it could be really small make sure it's
25:15 - something that takes you less than two
25:16 - minutes to do it
25:18 - but something that you do every single
25:20 - day so
25:21 - i'm going to ask you guys later what's a
25:23 - habit that you can get into
25:31 - all right cool so let's move forward
25:34 - here
25:35 - um and then yep i i read a book at the
25:39 - end
25:39 - which is right over here right cool this
25:42 - is the app i use to
25:44 - keep track of my streaks
25:47 - so things i want to make habits yeah so
25:50 - it's a habit tracker app
25:51 - so you can see it's tracking my gym 21
25:54 - days in a row
25:55 - shower video content
25:59 - days i'm taking my protein and days i'm
26:01 - doing sales calls
26:02 - it's actually tracking all of these
26:04 - things right so you can see
26:06 - i wrote them all down here so you guys
26:08 - can do the same thing
26:10 - where you can track whatever habits are
26:11 - important to you
26:13 - and then boom over the next few days you
26:15 - see incredible results
26:17 - would you guys like to see amazing
26:20 - results in your life and maybe it's not
26:21 - twelve hundred dollars
26:22 - but hey what if you made a hundred and
26:25 - twenty dollar sale wouldn't that be cool
26:27 - that would be 120
26:28 - extra that you made now imagine if you
26:30 - could make 120
26:31 - every single day well what happens when
26:33 - you make 120 dollars
26:35 - every single day multiply that by
26:38 - seven days that's 840 in one week
26:41 - multiply that by four and now you found
26:44 - a way to generate 300
26:46 - 3 360 worth of extra income
26:50 - than you were making now depender is
26:53 - asking me a great question and he said
26:55 - hey
26:56 - uh that makes sense but how do you get
26:58 - these sales calls how do you pitch
27:00 - yourself anywhere so that's a good
27:02 - question so let's talk about that
27:04 - you can go on fiverr or upwork or
27:06 - linkedin
27:07 - or instagram or facebook groups or wise
27:11 - ant or take
27:12 - lessons or craigslist the 10
27:15 - platforms that i just mentioned and you
27:16 - can do outreach on them
27:19 - and you can reach out to your target
27:21 - ideal client so for example people who
27:23 - would be interested in learning coding
27:25 - you can reach out to them you can have a
27:27 - conversation with them
27:28 - and you can say hey you know
27:31 - start a conversation with them and then
27:33 - just be like hey would you be interested
27:35 - in learning coding and improving your
27:37 - skills
27:38 - if they're like yes or you're like hey
27:40 - would you be interested in making a
27:41 - project like this would react and
27:42 - they're like yes
27:44 - would you be open to getting on a short
27:46 - call
27:48 - if they say yes now you've just gotten
27:50 - on a sales call
27:51 - and now your habit for the day is done
27:54 - and on that call
27:55 - you speak with them for 30 minutes to
27:57 - learn about their goals
27:59 - and then at the end you just say hey if
28:02 - you're interested
28:03 - i have a service that i think could help
28:05 - you and then wait for their permission
28:07 - to continue
28:08 - and if they're like yes what is it then
28:10 - you can have a conversation about it you
28:12 - could be like this is how much it is
28:13 - it's how much it costs and i think it'll
28:15 - really help you
28:17 - and then you just wait for them to say
28:18 - yes or no if they say no
28:20 - nothing changed in your life you're
28:22 - still the same person
28:24 - if they say yes you've now generated an
28:27 - extra 50
28:28 - extra 100 extra thousand dollars
28:31 - all right and boom now
28:34 - you're actually making an income and now
28:37 - you're actually
28:38 - have extra income for whatever you
28:41 - really want to use it for
28:43 - right
28:50 - so
28:55 - this is um what what's important for you
28:57 - guys too right so for example personally
28:59 - me
28:59 - i've cleared 4 400 cash so i want to
29:02 - make myself accountable too so if we're
29:04 - all trying to increase our income i'm
29:05 - like okay
29:06 - let me get in there manually with
29:08 - everybody else
29:09 - and we can all go together and we're all
29:11 - at different levels right
29:12 - so i'm here and i'm like okay i've
29:14 - cleared 4 400
29:16 - cash this week just over the phone using
29:18 - my phone okay
29:20 - and i've probably spent an hour hour and
29:23 - a half
29:24 - max right so would you like to make
29:27 - 4 400 an hour and a half yes or no
29:31 - in the comments below let me know and
29:33 - now imagine
29:34 - clearing clearing 4 400 in one week with
29:38 - this device with this device that we all
29:41 - have
29:42 - right here there's no excuse it's right
29:45 - literally right here
29:46 - right and in total the revenue is
29:50 - actually 9 200 because this is the cash
29:54 - that was generated but
29:56 - what's going to be collected later over
29:57 - the period of three months when it gets
29:58 - paid out it's going to be 9 200.
30:00 - so imagine clearing almost 10 000 in an
30:03 - hour and a half
30:05 - with three calls would that be
30:08 - powerful for you would that be helpful
30:09 - for you
30:11 - right so this is what i want you to
30:14 - understand the power
30:15 - of these habits you guys fitness
30:19 - just eat clean
30:22 - exercise for income just get on sales
30:26 - calls
30:27 - one sales call a day one sale call a
30:30 - week
30:31 - some kind of habit some kind of habit
30:34 - because i know for most people it's zero
30:36 - which makes sense why they're making
30:38 - zero extra dollars and they normally
30:39 - would
30:41 - small habits are insane
30:44 - i encourage if you want to go down the
30:46 - rabbit hole of the habits i recommend
30:47 - you read the book atomic habits
30:49 - absolutely fantastic
30:51 - life-changing for me got me you know
30:54 - going and like
30:54 - really destructuring everything i do
31:04 - all right so those are the life-changing
31:06 - apps i
31:07 - use right and i already show you guys
31:11 - what they are and i'm going to show you
31:12 - what these apps are called if you guys
31:14 - want them
31:16 - so do you guys want me to share these
31:18 - apps with you by the way or i can skip
31:19 - this portion if you guys want but if you
31:21 - think that these apps would be valuable
31:22 - i'd be happy to share them with you guys
31:29 - i like that uh angels so so small habits
31:33 - are insane or actually sane make up your
31:35 - mind
31:35 - that's funny i like it matea says yes
31:39 - please share
31:40 - uh hell yeah okay
31:45 - cool production says sure so here it is
31:48 - so you guys can get this app
31:51 - this app is called done you can have it
31:54 - on your iphone
31:56 - i i think this is a pretty amazing app
31:59 - um you can use it to quit habits or
32:02 - build habits i'm only using it to build
32:04 - habits
32:04 - and for me it's uh
32:08 - workouts and a few other ones that i've
32:10 - already listed out
32:12 - protein and stuff like that you can make
32:13 - it work out in
32:15 - code and then whatever else you want
32:17 - right so
32:18 - this app is a good app and i'm gonna
32:20 - move forward
32:21 - this is a really good app and i
32:23 - recommend that you all get it because
32:27 - if you want to increase your financial
32:30 - skills and you want to
32:32 - know how you're doing here's the thing
32:35 - right if you want to decrease your
32:36 - weight
32:37 - you have to check your weight if you
32:39 - don't track your weight it's going to be
32:40 - really hard for you to decrease your
32:42 - weight
32:43 - because you're going to be just going
32:44 - all over the place so just like when it
32:46 - comes to your body weight
32:48 - you need to track it to drop it
32:52 - with your money it's the same way if you
32:54 - want to increase your money
32:55 - you better track your money and
32:59 - there's only one number that i
33:01 - personally care about that i want to
33:02 - share with you and you can write this
33:03 - down as well for yourself
33:05 - that's more important than anything
33:08 - is this word right here okay this is the
33:11 - only thing i want you guys to use this
33:13 - is one number that'll tell you about all
33:16 - your financial health
33:17 - and so we'll we can practice on this
33:19 - live stream right here actually
33:22 - net worth this is the one number i want
33:25 - you to care about and know and you don't
33:27 - have to know about
33:27 - any other number all this means and i'm
33:30 - not talking about the crazy net worth
33:32 - where you're like trying to figure out
33:33 - how much your house
33:33 - is worth and your car is worth no no i
33:36 - just mean
33:37 - how much cash do you have in bank
33:40 - versus how much money do you have on
33:42 - your credit cards so
33:44 - for example let's say you had like you
33:46 - know
33:48 - three different credit cards
33:51 - let's say you had three different credit
33:52 - cards and you know on this credit card
33:55 - you had like
33:56 - one thousand dollar debt and then
33:59 - another credit card you had two thousand
34:01 - dollar debt
34:02 - and then let's say you had a bank
34:04 - account where you had five thousand
34:06 - dollars
34:07 - in their cash okay so what would your
34:10 - net worth be can anybody guess
34:14 - your net worth would be positive two
34:16 - thousand dollars that's your net worth
34:18 - that's the only number i want you to
34:19 - care about if i knew this number i know
34:21 - about your financial health
34:23 - i don't care about all of this crap i
34:25 - just want to know this number right here
34:28 - so for those of you guys who actually
34:31 - want to take action
34:32 - and change things what i want you to do
34:35 - is

34:56 - it's negative so if you find it negative
34:58 - and you don't want to share it don't be
34:59 - embarrassed about it
35:00 - just share it because you're going to
35:02 - give it too much power and then it makes
35:04 - it hard for you to actually increase
35:06 - your income and
35:08 - ability to make money code ninja says

37:40 - right rukaya is excited so what i do
37:45 - is i have um i have a folder
37:49 - all the way at the bottom called finance

38:27 - cool so i see my trend overall
38:30 - it's been positive that's a really good
38:33 - sign

38:36 - that gives me my entire financial health
38:39 - know this one number if you just know
38:40 - this number guys you
38:42 - are good in life you are so good and
38:45 - you're going to only move forward
38:47 - if you make money complex you're going
38:50 - to run away from it and it's going to
38:51 - make your life so difficult and so so
38:54 - hard
38:55 - just know this one number net worth and
38:57 - just keep making it go up
38:59 - that's it and you're good to go okay
39:01 - that's one of the really important
39:02 - things i can share with you most senses
39:04 - 2k
39:05 - awesome all right so whether you're in
39:09 - positive or negative
39:10 - no worries guys give yourself a pat on
39:14 - the back
39:15 - you're in it you're investing in
39:17 - yourself you're on this youtube live
39:18 - stream you're watching this
39:20 - you're commenting and you're already
39:22 - engaging in this
39:23 - all right so now it's time for you to
39:26 - start taking action and moving it
39:28 - forward
39:28 - but don't develop shame or guilt around
39:32 - looking at this thing most people have a
39:34 - lot of shame and guilt when it comes to
39:35 - their
39:36 - income so they have a really poor
39:39 - relationship with it
39:41 - if you have a poor relationship with it
39:42 - it's going to feel awful too you're
39:43 - never going to want to look at it it's
39:45 - going to be like punishment
39:48 - so work on changing your relationship
39:50 - with it and how it feels
39:52 - because if you're at negative 6 000 like
39:54 - somebody said
39:57 - your um chances are you're gonna be like
40:00 - really screwed
40:01 - for a really long time because you're
40:02 - gonna hate looking at it if you hate
40:04 - looking at it
40:05 - you're never gonna wanna change your
40:06 - income so you're gonna stay at negative
40:08 - 6k
40:10 - whereas somebody who's in positive like
40:12 - 3k or 8k or 10k and did like looking at
40:15 - it they're going to go from 10k
40:16 - to like 100k whereas the person who's at
40:19 - negative 6 is going to stay at negative
40:21 - 6. but if you start enjoying the process
40:23 - of looking at it and going from negative
40:25 - six or
40:26 - this week i'm gonna go from negative six
40:27 - to negative six thousand to let's say
40:30 - negative five thousand nine hundred
40:32 - that's cool
40:33 - i improved by a hundred bucks i'll go
40:35 - from negative five thousand nine hundred
40:37 - to negative
40:38 - five thousand six hundred this next week
40:40 - cool i sold some stuff and i'm like down
40:42 - to that
40:44 - boom you guys are gonna keep moving
40:46 - forward i'm gonna try to apply for some
40:48 - developer jobs or some developer gigs on
40:50 - these platforms damn i'm at negative
40:52 - four thousand now damn i'm a negative
40:54 - two thousand now
40:55 - oh i'm at positive two thousand oh
40:58 - i'm at ten thousand
41:00 - damn momentum feels great but if you
41:03 - don't track it it's not gonna improve
41:05 - cool awesome let's keep it moving
41:09 - if you guys don't have this app exactly
41:11 - then find some other app that's
41:13 - relevant to this um this is another app
41:17 - that i use
41:17 - this really really helpful for me it's
41:21 - called life some and this is the one
41:22 - where i track my food and calories and
41:24 - everything
41:25 - and it's helping me lose weight and just
41:27 - get
41:28 - very healthy and fit and get my mind
41:30 - right so
41:32 - and the the ui of this is just fantastic
41:36 - if for no other reason you get this app
41:38 - but just to see what a phenomenal
41:41 - user experience looks like a user
41:43 - interface looks like
41:44 - as a developer this is the app to check
41:47 - out and study
41:50 - all right let's move forward
41:56 - now winners and losers
41:59 - often have the same goals
42:03 - so i wanted to share with this with you
42:04 - guys because
42:07 - a winner wants to make a million dollars
42:09 - and also a loser wants to make a million
42:11 - dollars
42:12 - what separates the two a winner
42:15 - developer
42:15 - wants to make 5 000 a month and a loser
42:18 - developer also wants to make 5 000 a
42:20 - month
42:21 - what separates the two here's the thing
42:25 - if you completely ignored your goals and
42:27 - focused only on your system
42:29 - would you still succeed for example
42:33 - let me see if i can zoom in on this more
42:37 - nah i can't okay
42:40 - if you were a basketball coach and you
42:42 - ignored your goal to win
42:44 - a championship and focused only on what
42:45 - your team does at practice each day
42:47 - would you still get results
42:49 - i think you would so here's the thing
42:55 - winners and losers have the same goals
42:59 - the only difference between winners and
43:01 - losers
43:02 - is process that's it
43:06 - that's the only difference winners
43:09 - actually follow a process that will get
43:10 - them that result
43:12 - losers go up and down and do a lot of
43:15 - random things right so losers do
43:17 - random stuff like this and then they get
43:21 - discouraged
43:22 - and they don't get results and they quit
43:24 - right whereas a winner
43:26 - will be like hey i gotta get to here so
43:28 - i'm gonna do this
43:29 - and this this and this
43:32 - and now look i got here all right
43:37 - so for you guys it's the same way the
43:40 - this is why i'm pushing you guys to make
43:41 - five dollars this week
43:43 - or ten dollars as a freelancer this week
43:46 - and then share those wins
43:51 - okay let me go here
43:54 - and this is something i've been getting
43:57 - pretty into and getting pretty excited
43:59 - about
43:59 - which is like making making
44:02 - money a habit right so if
44:05 - you can actually make making money a
44:09 - habit how insane is that
44:13 - like literally you can make generating
44:16 - revenue a habit by the way if you
44:17 - haven't already smashed that like button
44:18 - guys do it because it's gonna help the
44:20 - video go
44:21 - out to more people
44:26 - and habits are very simple you got cue
44:28 - craving response
44:29 - reward all right so a queue
44:32 - is you smell food
44:36 - craving is you can experience
44:39 - what that chicken
44:42 - or what that biryani or whatever it is
44:45 - that's
44:45 - amazing is gonna taste like in your body
44:48 - so you start craving it
44:52 - and then the response means you
44:56 - your action so then you go to an actual
44:59 - restaurant to purchase
45:02 - that same food that you were craving for
45:05 - let's say it's chicken
45:08 - and french fries and then your reward is
45:11 - the dopamine hit like once you eat it
45:13 - it's that dopamine hit that you get
45:16 - after eating it right so
45:17 - that's your that's how habits work so
45:20 - you can make making money as a developer
45:22 - a habit
45:24 - you can actually give yourselves cues
45:27 - and cravings
45:28 - you're not gonna in the start have a
45:30 - craving if you don't do something you
45:32 - actually don't have a craving so it
45:33 - looks like this
45:34 - if you look at the dopamine
45:40 - in the start it actually everything is
45:42 - like flatlined
45:44 - and then as soon as you get the reward
45:46 - boom you're like
45:47 - wow that feels amazing so then this is
45:50 - graph like let's say one
45:52 - then what it looks like in graph two if
45:54 - i made graph two
45:56 - salman thank you for the five dollar
45:58 - donation he says really loving this
45:59 - content i built a react resume and
46:01 - portfolio video series too
46:03 - that's amazing thank you brother
46:04 - appreciate it
46:06 - man patel says i just got my first
46:08 - client with 250 for making a wordpress
46:10 - site
46:11 - yes so we got 300
46:15 - plus 250 amazing
46:20 - 550 made just on this stream
46:24 - that's epic thanks for sharing
46:28 - that and um i will actually
46:31 - screenshot it
46:36 - see if i can send it to david
46:42 - cool cool cool cool
46:46 - cool all right cool
46:50 - so let's go here now graph two
46:53 - actually looks like this because you
46:55 - already have
46:56 - gotten a reward now you get that
46:59 - dopamine hit during the craving phase so
47:01 - for example
47:02 - something will cue you and
47:06 - you will start craving and you will get
47:08 - that dopamine hit then you will like go
47:10 - and take the response to do it meaning
47:12 - you'll take the action to do it
47:13 - and then you'll get the reward and
47:15 - you'll be like pretty excited about it
47:16 - right
47:17 - so you'll only start to develop a
47:19 - craving for something once you've
47:21 - already gotten reward from it and that
47:23 - dopamine hit
47:24 - so what does that mean that means until
47:27 - you get your first few
47:28 - sales and you make some money you're not
47:31 - gonna crave it
47:33 - you're not gonna be able to develop
47:35 - sales calls
47:36 - or outreaching as a developer into a
47:38 - habit
47:39 - until you actually go through the
47:42 - process and you
47:43 - get that sale but once you get that sale
47:46 - and you get that dopamine hit of what it
47:48 - feels like to make a thousand dollars or
47:50 - 250 dollars
47:53 - oops well then
47:56 - now the next time you can actually
47:58 - anticipate it and crave it in
48:00 - anticipation
48:01 - and then it will start becoming a more
48:03 - and more of a habit
48:05 - that makes sense i got my first few
48:08 - clients from platforms like why is that
48:10 - take lessons and craigslist
48:17 - so that cool all right
48:27 - um if you guys really want something to
48:30 - be a habit you guys can actually stack
48:32 - it with something you guaranteed do so
48:33 - for example i know guaranteed i
48:35 - wake up so i this was a new habit
48:40 - so i'm going to actually say new habit
48:46 - right and this over here
48:50 - waking up is an old habit so
48:54 - habit stacking means you can actually
48:56 - chain
48:57 - your habits so you can take an old habit
49:01 - and connect the new habit with it and
49:02 - now
49:03 - that new habit becomes your habit so
49:06 - for you if it's like you can you can you
49:09 - can make it
49:10 - so you have the habit of oh thank you so
49:13 - much
49:14 - thank you so much baby appreciate it so
49:16 - you can have the habit of
49:18 - waking up and then you could do
49:23 - doing outreach or uh going on fiverr
49:28 - and doing outreaches that make sense
49:35 - so you can chain them together this is
49:37 - your old habit
49:39 - and this is your new habit and now
49:41 - they're chained and if you do that
49:43 - for 60 to 80 days
49:46 - it'll become something you start craving
49:49 - and you'll feel
49:50 - weird if you don't outreach on fiverr or
49:52 - upwork or
49:53 - freelancer.com or whatever the platform
49:55 - is right it'll actually become weird
50:04 - cool so
50:09 - habit one habit two habit we have before
50:11 - you can stack them
50:13 - you can chain them it'll make you likely
50:16 - to do them more
50:17 - right so for example example after i
50:20 - pour my morning cup of coffee i will
50:22 - meditate for 60 seconds
50:24 - so go ahead right now in the comments
50:26 - below
50:27 - because i care more about
50:28 - transformations i'm not interested in
50:30 - here to actually give you content i want
50:32 - to
50:32 - help you guys actually make a difference
50:34 - in your life
50:36 - so in the comments below i want you guys
50:39 - to go ahead and write
50:40 - what's the new habit that you're going
50:42 - to develop that'll help
50:43 - you make more money as a freelance
50:45 - developer
50:47 - that's one and two what habit are you
50:49 - going to chain it with
50:50 - so write a full sentence like
50:54 - right now because otherwise what's the
50:56 - point of watching this right what's the
50:58 - point of us being here
51:00 - so let's actually use this to do
51:02 - something positive so we can make an
51:04 - impact in our own income and in our own
51:06 - life because that is exciting
51:09 - so write down below for you what that
51:11 - actually means what's that new habit
51:13 - that you're going to develop
51:14 - and i'm going to start reading it out
51:15 - loud and in a little bit we'll start
51:16 - doing calls as well
51:24 - okay so we got somebody saying
51:45 - all right so we got
51:50 - garveet sings i will drink a gallon of
51:53 - water every day
51:54 - okay amazing priyanshu says i will
52:06 - meditate and post on instagram amazing
52:10 - saeed says wake up and have exercise
52:13 - awesome
52:17 - matea says swap social media with upwork
52:22 - that's brilliant that will
52:26 - help you make guaranteed more money
52:28 - guaranteed just that's what i mean
52:31 - you're saying that you're probably gonna
52:33 - still use social media that's really
52:35 - hard to just give up social media
52:37 - so that's not really habit
52:41 - stacking because you're making uh like
52:44 - that's something you're using willpower
52:46 - to say right now
52:47 - but you're gonna run out of that
52:48 - willpower and you're gonna go back to
52:50 - eventually
52:51 - just using social media of course if you
52:53 - could do this and stick to it then
52:55 - unbelievable results would happen for
52:56 - you
52:57 - but what i would rather have you say is
53:00 - chain
53:02 - um i would rather have you
53:05 - chain your
53:08 - you know upwork to you doing something
53:11 - like you brush your teeth and right
53:12 - after you're done brushing your teeth
53:14 - you can say hey i'll go on upwork
53:18 - because right now you won't have a queue
53:20 - to go on upwork you'll have no cue
53:22 - you're you're you're never even gonna
53:26 - think about going on upwork that's the
53:28 - thing
53:29 - so you got to create your own cue
53:34 - leonard says wake up and watch lectures
53:36 - in university great
53:37 - that's awesome
53:41 - uh the technical technic filer says one
53:44 - enhance my skills twos i will two i will
53:46 - reduce my laziness that those are not
53:48 - habits you can't just
53:49 - do that you can't just go i'll just
53:52 - reduce my i'll increase my willpower you
53:55 - can't just do
53:56 - that so that's not gonna do anything for
53:58 - you
53:59 - waking up at 4 am okay dope
54:04 - that's good
54:08 - we'll put two to three hours every day
54:11 - apart from my job from now on to build
54:12 - my portfolio and will full throttle
54:14 - on increasing my net worth awesome
54:20 - wake up and read a book also awesome
54:22 - that's cool
54:33 - awesome so these are good guys as long
54:36 - as you do these
54:37 - you're going to be on track to for
54:39 - greatness
54:51 - a lot of you still are not talking about
54:53 - how you're going to increase your income
54:54 - as a developer
54:55 - so if you don't talk about how you're
54:57 - going to do that your
54:58 - income is not going to increase and if
55:00 - you clicked on this video i imagine
55:02 - that's probably to increase your income
55:04 - so i'm happy for your lifestyle and
55:06 - health goals
55:08 - but i do want you guys to also talk
55:09 - about what your plan is to increase your
55:11 - income what habit you're going to
55:12 - develop
55:14 - i will check up work after i wake up
55:18 - or maybe there's another thing that you
55:20 - guaranteed do every day
55:22 - i don't know what it is maybe you work
55:24 - every day maybe you so you can be like
55:26 - i'm gonna check this after i get off
55:29 - work or right before i go to work
55:31 - so take something you do guaranteed and
55:33 - then chain it after or before it
55:35 - the new habit that you're trying to
55:36 - create
55:39 - digazo says i've joined people per hour
55:41 - yesterday that's awesome
55:42 - now are you doing outreach on there
55:45 - because if you're not doing outreach
55:46 - you're not going to actually
55:48 - get clients
55:52 - so i want you to actually develop some
55:54 - kind of action plan
55:56 - and do that every day i've applied to
55:57 - people per hour patch says why is that
55:59 - upwork take lesson started the process
56:01 - of reaching out to freelancing clients
56:02 - awesome so
56:06 - patch can you actually make that a habit
56:08 - of outreaching
56:09 - and maybe even set a time on in a day
56:12 - so it's something you do guaranteed
56:15 - every single
56:16 - day and then it's just
56:19 - chained to your day so it could either
56:22 - be chained to you waking up it could be
56:23 - chained to you working out it could be
56:25 - chained to
56:26 - i don't know you after you play your
56:28 - guitar every day could
56:30 - like whatever it is
56:39 - die gaza says my question is what
56:41 - strategy follows should i take
56:42 - aggressive technique and send requests
56:44 - all the time
56:46 - so don't spam but start conversations
56:49 - start sales conversations that's what i
56:52 - want you guys to focus on
56:53 - so what does that look like compliment
56:55 - and question that's how you start a
56:56 - conversation with somebody
56:59 - compliment question so for example you
57:01 - go on somebody's instagram
57:02 - or you reach out to somebody and you're
57:04 - like

57:30 - what's your
57:31 - goal right now with coding what's your
57:33 - goal right now with this
57:34 - but you guys don't have to even do that
57:36 - right now on instagram and platforms
57:38 - like linkedin that's
57:39 - a little bit more advanced you can but i
57:42 - would recommend you just go on people
57:43 - per hour and craigslist where they're
57:44 - very transactional marketplaces
57:47 - and you can actually be much more
57:48 - aggressive in your approach because

57:51 - that you're trying to give them a
57:53 - service
57:59 - yep on those platforms outreach and just
58:02 - be like hey i can actually help you with
58:04 - your
58:04 - code or yes for five dollars i will
58:08 - do some project or for fifty dollars

58:11 - small but i want you guys to collect
58:14 - wins
58:17 - zainab says that's amazing she goes i
58:18 - say i wake up
58:20 - meditate tell myself nothing is
58:22 - impossible and get to coding at least
58:23 - two hours before i attend my classes
58:25 - that's awesome
58:27 - your well wisher says can i pay an
58:28 - installment for profit with javascript
58:30 - course
58:30 - yes i think if in the description if you
58:34 - click
58:35 - you can pay in installments for profit
58:37 - with javascript there's three
58:38 - installments
58:43 - all right let's see what we got
58:48 - okay
58:53 - right so
58:56 - this is an example of an outreach oh

68:42 - yeah yeah um uh you know it's been a
68:45 - little
68:46 - it's not like you know monday wednesday
68:48 - friday we have a call it's just kind of
68:50 - i just kind of tell them like whenever
68:51 - you guys are available how much
68:53 - how much have they how much have you
68:55 - generated so far
68:56 - is it like 50 bucks is it a hundred
68:58 - bucks like
68:59 - from yeah it's 50 bucks so far yeah
69:03 - got it okay and are you pl
69:06 - so now okay so you don't have planned
69:09 - followed up
69:10 - sessions with them um i mean i tell them
69:14 - you know
69:14 - whenever you guys i just kind of like
69:17 - leave it up to them for now which i'm
69:19 - not sure is the right approach but i'm
69:20 - just kind of like all right you know
69:21 - when do you want to do your next lesson
69:23 - so i pose that question
69:25 - and then you know they'll either say you
69:27 - know when you available and be like i'm
69:29 - available tomorrow
69:30 - all right let's do it tomorrow so um i
69:33 - just kind of like
69:34 - put the ball in their court which again
69:36 - i'm not sure is the correct approach but
69:38 - you know i also don't want to like make
69:40 - them feel forced
69:42 - um so you know
69:45 - again i don't know if that's the correct
69:47 - approach but that's what i've been going
69:48 - with so far
69:49 - okay cool so
69:52 - this is not the best approach because
69:56 - you're putting a ball in their court but
69:58 - what you're not realizing is they're
70:00 - putting the ball
70:01 - in your cord gotcha
70:05 - so until somebody just takes a
70:09 - ball and starts doing something with it
70:11 - nothing will really happen right
70:14 - um like for i'll give you an example
70:16 - right
70:18 - when i book my uh
70:22 - like i i work out with adrian right i
70:24 - don't know if you see him on my
70:25 - instagram stories but he's
70:27 - yeah miller muscle or something right
70:29 - miller muscle exactly
70:30 - so i trained with him right yeah so when
70:33 - i was
70:33 - gonna book a session with him i only did
70:35 - one session but before he left
70:38 - he closed me for 10 follow-up sessions
70:43 - okay um and in that moment i was like
70:45 - what the like i kind of just he was
70:47 - like when do you want to do the next one
70:48 - and i was like yeah
70:49 - you know i'll hit you up he's like how
70:51 - about uh we do 10
70:53 - you know we booked 10 i'm like that
70:55 - sounds cool
70:56 - uh yeah i'm like just follow up with me
70:57 - later and we can take it from there and
70:59 - he he
70:59 - asked me he goes yeah let's just go
71:02 - ahead and venmo it right now and then go
71:04 - from there
71:05 - and i was like damn all right he got me
71:08 - i was like all right cool let's just do
71:09 - it
71:10 - all right so i venmoed him and paid him
71:12 - for the 10 upcoming sessions
71:15 - but guess what do you think i'm
71:19 - happy right now that we have 10 sessions
71:21 - booked in advance or i'm pissed
71:24 - right i see what you're saying see what
71:26 - i'm saying so like yeah
71:28 - i am happy that he made me pull the
71:31 - trigger
71:32 - because every single time i'm done with
71:33 - one of those sessions i'm like yes
71:35 - and i like
71:36 - watch myself grow because if i didn't
71:40 - if he hadn't done that i wouldn't book
71:42 - 10 sessions i would just do one and then
71:43 - like
71:44 - it would just be airy fairy and
71:45 - everything would get lost
71:48 - and i would not be getting the results i
71:50 - want
71:51 - in my kickboxing skills or fitness
71:53 - skills
71:54 - sure so i'm
71:57 - thankful that he closed me right
72:02 - yeah no that that that that makes a lot
72:05 - of sense
72:06 - um um you know and then
72:10 - also what i have told them is like you
72:12 - know i don't want you guys to book
72:14 - i actually said i don't want you guys to
72:16 - book 10 lessons in advance
72:18 - and then not have the time to do them
72:21 - and they just kind of like back
72:23 - themselves up and stuff like that
72:25 - but um i guess i'll have to sort of like
72:27 - reformat that a little bit
72:30 - well they don't have to book the times
72:32 - in advance
72:35 - right true yeah it's a good point
72:40 - they can keep the time flexible that's
72:42 - what adrian does for example
72:44 - the time will be flexible so
72:48 - you know like if you
72:52 - like i'll give you an example right even
72:53 - the we have a 90-day program
72:56 - if we don't have a 90-day
72:57 - transformational program nobody's going
72:59 - to want to do more than
73:01 - just a few calls because they people get
73:03 - confused or lost they can't see the
73:06 - slow progress right like if you want to
73:09 - get somebody to hear
73:11 - and if they're excited about getting to
73:13 - this goal
73:15 - um i think my screen will show you in
73:17 - about 30 seconds or whatever
73:19 - because you're probably behind but if
73:21 - somebody wants to get to some high level
73:23 - goal right
73:24 - they're not gonna see all the small
73:27 - steps that they take
73:28 - to get there but they're gonna realize
73:31 - once
73:32 - they're there they're like oh now i can
73:34 - do this that's sick
73:37 - these these small steps here are like
73:40 - maybe let's say 12
73:42 - sessions you had with them right
73:46 - so especially as somebody who's not
73:49 - there yet where they want to be
73:51 - they're not going to know what they need
73:52 - to get there so it's actually not their
73:55 - job to figure that out their job is to
73:59 - pay you
74:00 - to figure that out
74:03 - right so for example you see what i'm
74:05 - saying so for example for you
74:07 - the there are
74:10 - multiple ways you can make more income
74:13 - right and let's just brainstorm together
74:15 - what are ways you can improve your
74:16 - income
74:18 - right now
74:21 - uh well joining all the uh
74:24 - joining all the websites like people per
74:26 - hour and wise and upwork and all that
74:28 - stuff
74:28 - and reaching out to you know seeing a
74:30 - job and you know sending in an
74:32 - application for it
74:33 - or you know posting stuff on instagram
74:36 - or facebook
74:37 - or pretty much i feel like it's whatever
74:39 - whatever
74:40 - method you can do to show people
74:44 - that they can trust you with you
74:47 - teaching them
74:47 - what it is they want to learn got it
74:50 - whatever whatever
74:51 - format that is i'm sure it's different
74:53 - for everyone but those are the just
74:54 - particular ways that i like to do it got
74:56 - it so basically one way you can increase
74:59 - your income
74:59 - is by increasing the volume of outreach
75:03 - right yep so one is just volume
75:07 - what is another way you could increase
75:09 - your income
75:12 - um
75:16 - uh
75:20 - i don't know um you know
75:25 - making a website or like you know
75:28 - not necessarily reaching out but just
75:31 - putting yourself
75:32 - out there like you know here's my you
75:34 - know here's my
75:36 - portfolio gonna still throw that in the
75:38 - outreach
75:39 - column for volume okay cool
75:43 - um so what about yeah what
75:47 - what if you doubled your
75:51 - the rate that you charge would that
75:53 - increase your income
75:54 - oh sure yeah yeah yeah definitely
75:58 - so that's another way right yep
76:02 - so if you doubled your price you would
76:05 - double your income
76:06 - pretty much overnight
76:09 - yep okay cool um
76:13 - is there any other way we could increase
76:15 - your income
76:19 - type of way okay i was gonna say i don't
76:22 - know if this falls in the same category
76:24 - but
76:24 - you know booking people for sort of like
76:27 - a package deal on lessons rather than
76:29 - one at a time
76:31 - yes exactly so selling packages that's
76:34 - brilliant that's really smart okay so
76:36 - you could do a package deal
76:39 - instead of one-offs so when you set
76:41 - package deal what i want you to focus
76:43 - more on
76:44 - is um and this is gonna help boost your
76:47 - income and
76:48 - take you into four or five figures very
76:50 - very quickly
76:51 - but it's so there's one off and then
76:53 - they're packaged deals right
76:54 - i want you to think of in terms of
76:56 - transformation deals
77:00 - okay sort of like sort of like
77:03 - you know a result based package if you
77:06 - will like if you take this program then
77:08 - you know in
77:09 - 10 lessons i'll you know make you a
77:11 - master of javascript or whatever
77:13 - yep so like understand what their goal
77:16 - is
77:16 - and understand their language and
77:18 - frustration point
77:19 - so you're not projecting your language
77:21 - and your goals
77:24 - right if they're saying my goal is to
77:29 - master the part of you know the basics
77:31 - of javascript like that's really
77:33 - frustrating for me
77:34 - then if your program can help them with
77:37 - that
77:38 - then now it's a transformation deal like
77:42 - this is a it's a 10 10 sessions but it's
77:45 - like a transformation
77:46 - package deal right
77:49 - okay yeah cool okay and you could even
77:53 - so now what's the benefit of a package
77:58 - you know versus one-offs
78:02 - um well a package would sort of
78:06 - guarantee you the money up front and it
78:08 - would be
78:10 - in tune with you know something more
78:12 - sort of
78:13 - consistent and guaranteed rather than
78:16 - you know just do it whenever you feel
78:18 - like that inconsistency
78:20 - yes
78:23 - and consistency and reliability is
78:26 - actually a huge thing that a lot of
78:28 - freelancers don't
78:30 - know how to get to but right they
78:33 - want to get to that and and and you know
78:36 - correct me if i'm wrong but i feel like
78:38 - that's a big
78:39 - that's a big you know sort of that's
78:41 - very much interwoven with your ability
78:43 - of your soft skills and stuff like that
78:47 - correct right absolutely
78:50 - so okay so now we have really good ways
78:52 - we got
78:54 - uh now can you tell me which ways are
78:57 - if we had to put them in difficulty
79:00 - which way is easy medium or
79:03 - and hard so like these three that we
79:06 - have right now
79:07 - outreach 2x your price
79:10 - transformation deal uh i feel like
79:14 - i feel like just flip package deal and
79:16 - reach out because the package deal i
79:18 - feel like is always going to be the
79:19 - harder sell because it's more money up
79:21 - front
79:22 - but and you know the two times the price
79:24 - is
79:25 - you know it's obviously more money but
79:27 - it's not so when i say
79:29 - when i say difficult i mean uh in terms
79:31 - of like
79:32 - you effort that it requires from you
79:36 - oh right right so for example which one
79:38 - of these
79:39 - is high effort requiring versus low
79:42 - effort requiring that's what i mean with
79:44 - easy and
79:44 - hard gotcha uh well then probably the
79:47 - reach out would be the most difficult
79:49 - because it just requires more emails
79:51 - more writing more
79:52 - you know more research
79:55 - and stuff like that to find the people
79:57 - that reach out to you so that's
79:59 - the hard one which ones are is there any
80:01 - other ones that are also hard or are
80:03 - they
80:04 - medium or easy and which ones are uh i
80:07 - feel like
80:08 - you know i feel like as is then as it's
80:10 - written i mean i've
80:11 - been that you know the package deal will
80:13 - be the easiest because if you know you
80:15 - sell them you sell one person on a 10
80:16 - lesson package then there's you know 500
80:18 - bucks right there
80:20 - um so i feel like that's probably the
80:23 - easiest in terms of like how to bring in
80:25 - income
80:26 - um but you know at the same time
80:30 - the 2x the prices sort of feels like the
80:32 - same kind of thing except just on a
80:34 - smaller scale
80:36 - yep
80:41 - so yeah so what would you put the 2x sub
80:44 - pricing would you put that as
80:45 - easy thing that requires it's easy in
80:47 - terms of the effort that it requires on
80:49 - your end is it hard or medium
80:52 - uh i i'd say it's
80:55 - i'd say i wanna i want to say medium
81:00 - um but uh
81:05 - just because you know it's only
81:08 - one lesson uh i mean
81:11 - it could be more it could be one lesson
81:14 - or it could be doubling the price of
81:15 - your transformation deal
81:17 - like your entire package deal right so
81:20 - and do you want to hear my thoughts on
81:22 - this definitely yeah so i agree with you
81:25 - on the outreach it's the most difficult
81:28 - and it's uh very vague as well
81:31 - it's like very ethereal it's like
81:33 - intangible
81:35 - right now between these other two
81:40 - the one that i think is the easiest
81:42 - personally
81:44 - is the pricing
81:47 - it takes almost zero effort on your end
81:52 - the only effort it takes on your end
81:54 - that when it's time
81:55 - to say the price instead of saying the
81:58 - word
82:00 - uh 50 you have to say the word 100
82:04 - right so effort wise it's actually the
82:07 - least effort taking so it's like the
82:09 - easy it doesn't mean you
82:10 - it will work doesn't mean you have to do
82:12 - it but effort wise i think that
82:14 - increasing the price is the easiest
82:16 - thing to do
82:18 - it's very low effort on your end yeah um
82:21 - the package one i would say is like
82:24 - easy or medium because you have to
82:26 - actually come up with what the
82:27 - transformation is like
82:28 - then you have to actually pitch what the
82:30 - transformation is you have to actually
82:32 - have a sales call
82:33 - so like that takes a little bit more
82:36 - effort
82:38 - makes sense but yeah and i think in the
82:40 - ballpark like we're on the same page
82:42 - so um okay so this is good now
82:47 - the one thing i want to uh speak with
82:50 - you about here
82:51 - is when you talk about reaching out
82:54 - it's uh it's a random cloud of things
82:57 - and i want to help give you some clarity
82:59 - in there
83:00 - okay because this is where a lot of
83:02 - people get lost with the with the
83:03 - outreach
83:05 - so i want you to become very precise
83:07 - with this and i'll help you work
83:09 - backwards so let's say we want to get
83:13 - the tren let's start with the
83:14 - sale first and then we'll work backwards
83:17 - from there
83:17 - so how much would you want to charge
83:20 - with your let's say a transformation
83:21 - deal first of all how many sessions
83:23 - would this transformation deal be
83:26 - um i think you know somewhere between
83:31 - eight to ten i reckon would be a good
83:34 - would be a good starting point
83:35 - okay eight to ten sessions i love that
83:38 - great
83:40 - and how much would you charge total for
83:43 - it
83:43 - like let's just say it's ten sessions
83:46 - yeah so i would
83:47 - normally um you know 30 bucks an hour
83:52 - is just for one hour you know that would
83:53 - so that would be let's say 300
83:56 - for for 10 sessions but
83:59 - i feel like you know
84:02 - there's potentially more value in a
84:04 - transformation package as opposed to
84:06 - just
84:07 - a one-off lesson here and there yes so i
84:10 - mean i could
84:11 - i could feel it being justified and
84:14 - saying you know i know i'm 30 bucks
84:16 - an hour but you know you pay 400 for 10
84:18 - lessons which equates to 40 bucks an
84:20 - hour
84:20 - you're ultimately sort of you know quote
84:23 - unquote getting guaranteed results
84:26 - as opposed to you know because this is
84:28 - what i offer in this package
84:30 - and if you believe that i can do it then
84:33 - yeah
84:33 - buy the package but you know if you
84:35 - don't believe i can do it then
84:37 - you know we'll just do one-off lessons
84:38 - here and there yep so in this
84:40 - you're focusing on the results you're
84:42 - also focused you can also
84:44 - tell them hey you can reach out to me
84:45 - through text whatever questions you
84:47 - have right so cool so
84:50 - we can do so this will be 10 sessions
84:53 - for example
84:55 - okay i'm just going to write 10 s and
84:57 - that's what that will signify
85:00 - okay cool so 10 sessions for 400
85:04 - i love that i think that's actually
85:06 - really good starting point
85:08 - and i think that's very possible now
85:12 - working backwards from here what i mean
85:14 - is let's work backwards to how we can
85:17 - get to that 400 right so okay so we got
85:19 - the sale is 400 now
85:23 - in order for the sale to happen
85:27 - what is the action that you need to do
85:29 - what's the
85:30 - what's the action that happens right
85:32 - before
85:34 - the money goes into your bank account
85:39 - what's what's the action that that
85:41 - happens like you know the
85:43 - the you know the contact with the client
85:45 - or something like that or that
85:46 - exactly sales call the physical sales
85:49 - call right
85:50 - yeah so this is actually
85:53 - the closest thing this is the action
85:55 - that actually
85:56 - generates revenue in your bank account
86:01 - right cool so
86:05 - now we'll work backwards from there as
86:07 - well right so okay so this if this is
86:09 - the last step
86:11 - and then this is let's just say sales
86:13 - calls like the second last step
86:15 - right um what happens
86:18 - before the sales call
86:22 - what do you need to do in order to get
86:24 - on a sales call
86:26 - like what's the step that happens before
86:27 - the sales call general generally
86:30 - the the reaching out to the client and
86:32 - seeing if they would be
86:33 - interested in something like this and
86:35 - asking them if they wanted to
86:37 - get on the phone for a chat and i can
86:38 - tell them what it's all about and what
86:40 - i'm offering and stuff
86:41 - so is it the outreach or is it the
86:43 - conversation in the dms which one is it
86:47 - is the outreach the outreach which leads
86:51 - to the conversation in the dms which
86:53 - leads to the sales call
86:54 - so the step that's right before the
86:56 - sales calls is actually the conversation
86:59 - in the dm yeah yep so it's like so i'll
87:01 - just say dms
87:03 - okay
87:07 - and then what's the thing that happens
87:10 - in order to get so so basically
87:14 - correct me if i'm wrong in any area or
87:16 - just let me know if i'm right so far
87:18 - so we're having we're in the dms
87:21 - we're having a conversation then we
87:24 - generate a
87:25 - sales call then we get on the sales call
87:27 - then we pitch the program and
87:29 - 400 is just cash cha-ching just hit our
87:32 - bank account
87:33 - so far so good yeah so what's the action
87:37 - that
87:38 - happens before we can actually get into
87:40 - dms
87:43 - uh well you
87:46 - find the you know for example somebody
87:49 - that
87:49 - wants to learn and you know you happen
87:52 - to offer
87:53 - what they're looking to learn and then
87:54 - you just say hey you know
87:56 - so it still is a dm but it's like a
87:59 - different level of a different type of
88:00 - dm it's like hey are you open to this
88:02 - conversation so it's kind of like
88:05 - sort of the investigation into the
88:07 - potential
88:08 - client yeah but yeah so what's happening
88:12 - right before the dms is you're actually
88:14 - before a conversation takes place you're
88:17 - actually
88:18 - out reaching to multiple people right
88:20 - and then only one of those people
88:22 - chooses to have a conversation with you
88:24 - right so right before dms is it fair to
88:27 - say
88:28 - that the thing that you're actually
88:29 - doing is
88:31 - outreach and when i say outreach i mean
88:33 - you say hey
88:35 - hey like text messaging 5
88:38 - 10 20 different people that's what i
88:40 - mean specifically by outreach is it fair
88:42 - to say right before
88:43 - conversations in the dms uh
88:47 - outreach takes place yeah
88:50 - okay so outreach
88:56 - okay so now we've gone it down to a
88:59 - four-step process right
89:00 - outreach conversation sales call
89:04 - cash and bank yep okay cool
89:08 - so with this outreach thing
89:13 - there are two different types of
89:15 - outreach
89:17 - there is an inbound and then there's
89:19 - outbound
89:22 - do you know the difference between the
89:24 - two
89:26 - uh uh well outbound would maybe be you
89:30 - reaching out and inbound would be them
89:32 - seeing your profile and
89:34 - reaching out correct so when you make
89:38 - content
89:39 - the only purpose of that content is to
89:42 - generate
89:43 - what types of
89:47 - inbound or outbound
89:51 - uh inbound yeah the whole point
89:54 - of creating content aka when people
89:57 - lightly use the term putting myself out
89:59 - there
90:00 - or they say something the whole point is
90:03 - to
90:04 - generate inbound interest
90:07 - right um but but
90:10 - you can always be doing outbound because
90:12 - that never ends that pool is like
90:14 - unlimited right
90:16 - yeah but you always have to make sure
90:18 - you're making
90:19 - forward progress because you can
90:23 - outreach to a million people but if you
90:26 - never actually start a conversation in
90:28 - the dms
90:30 - will you ever lead to making 400
90:34 - in cash no if you
90:37 - reach out to a million you have a
90:39 - million conversations going but you
90:41 - don't do a single sales call
90:43 - will you ever hit 400 cash in bank
90:46 - no no so
90:49 - it's less about how many are we doing
90:54 - is more about how many are actually
90:55 - completing the entire process
90:57 - and getting to the pitch on a sales call
91:00 - right
91:01 - right so generally what i'll tell you
91:05 - is if you have a regular sales script if
91:08 - you
91:09 - are like a average person with the
91:11 - average
91:12 - like somewhat sensical sales
91:16 - script you can close
91:19 - 20 of the people that you get on a call
91:21 - with
91:24 - not bad so we'll
91:27 - do some reverse math in there right so
91:29 - basically to make one
91:31 - sale how many calls would you need to
91:33 - get on patch
91:35 - five perfect so we would need to get on
91:38 - five sales calls in order to generate
91:41 - four hundred dollars you agree with me
91:44 - yep cool now in order to get on five
91:48 - sales calls
91:50 - how many conversations in the dms would
91:52 - we need to be having
91:54 - in order to generate those sales calls
91:57 - so i'll give you this
91:58 - generally uh what i've seen is 10
92:02 - of the convos will ever get to a sales
92:05 - call if you're doing a good
92:07 - sales script in the dms so how many
92:10 - conversations would you need to have to
92:13 - generate
92:14 - one sales call so how many to just
92:16 - generate one sales call
92:18 - uh 10 about 10. yup
92:21 - so 10 i'll write this where my face
92:25 - doesn't block it so 10
92:27 - dms will equal
92:31 - one sales call right yeah
92:34 - so in order to generate
92:38 - five sales calls how many conversations
92:41 - would you need to have going
92:44 - to generate 10 sales calls about 50
92:46 - right i'm sorry
92:47 - to generate um five sales calls five
92:52 - generate five sales calls if 10
92:55 - leads to a sales vote yeah about 50
92:57 - right yes correct
92:59 - so you would need to have 50
93:01 - conversations ongoing
93:03 - in order to do five calls
93:08 - and on those five calls you could sell
93:09 - something for four hundred or
93:11 - thousand or two thousand or three
93:12 - thousand three thousand
93:14 - is where it gets like a little bit more
93:16 - difficult
93:17 - but you could definitely sell something
93:19 - for one thousand to two thousand
93:22 - and let's go one step back
93:25 - in order to generate 50 conversations
93:28 - how many
93:28 - outreaches would we need to be doing
93:33 - so i i will say it like this i'll say
93:41 - honestly if you do a good job and you're
93:44 - not just spamming people
93:45 - 10 of the people you outreach should
93:48 - start should turn into a conversation
93:52 - so that's what i would say so how many
93:55 - outreaches
93:56 - would we need to do to get one
93:58 - conversation going
94:03 - uh
94:06 - about 50
94:12 - 10 of them will turn so
94:15 - um you would need to do let me see if i
94:19 - could rephrase it
94:23 - one out of every 10 people you reach out
94:25 - to turn into a conversation in the dms
94:28 - right so to generate one conversation in
94:31 - the dms
94:32 - you would need to do
94:37 - 10 outreaches i i'm like you see what
94:40 - i'm saying
94:41 - okay yeah yeah right okay so
94:44 - 10 let me write it the other way so 10
94:49 - outreach is
94:53 - equal to one
94:57 - dm convo ongoing
95:01 - cool all right so then in order to
95:04 - get 50 convos going now you would
95:08 - actually need to do
95:09 - quite a lot of work right 10 times that
95:11 - would be like
95:13 - 10 times 50. so you would need to do
95:15 - about 500 outreaches to get
95:18 - 50 convos if that makes sense right yep
95:21 - yep okay
95:26 - okay cool so
95:30 - this sounds like a this is like a lot of
95:33 - volume
95:34 - in my experience if you're doing good
95:35 - outreach generally
95:38 - 30 of the people will reply to you and
95:40 - if you're doing
95:41 - really good dms like 30 percent of the
95:44 - people will actually get on a call with
95:46 - you so you can
95:47 - reduce the number like crazy if you're
95:49 - not spamming
95:50 - like if you don't spam you don't have to
95:52 - do 50 outreaches you can actually do 20
95:54 - outreaches and generate a sale
95:56 - right like it's really crazy how
95:58 - effective it can be if you
96:00 - take the time to actually personalize
96:02 - your messages but this is like yeah
96:04 - go ahead no i was just saying i really
96:07 - don't like spamming either because you
96:08 - know people have done it to me before
96:10 - and it's annoying so i would never want
96:11 - to do it to someone else
96:14 - exactly like yeah exactly
96:18 - so plus plus it shows you know more
96:20 - personality and the fact that you took
96:22 - the time to personalize the message
96:24 - i think means a lot more yep it does
96:29 - it means a lot for people and
96:32 - that's why the results also show you
96:34 - know if you actually do that it's
96:35 - completely worth the time and energy to
96:38 - do that so
96:39 - basically 500 outreaches will lead to
96:43 - one sale and then that's one customer
96:45 - you can work with on a recurring basis
96:47 - even after the recession is over
96:49 - you could do it again now to do 500
96:51 - outreaches
96:53 - i think that it can take about
96:59 - if you're focused how long would it take
97:01 - to do
97:03 - betw um you know how many outreaches
97:05 - have you done by the way
97:06 - total uh i mean probably about
97:11 - 10 to 20 so far somewhere in there and
97:14 - how many did any of them lead to sales
97:16 - for you
97:18 - um yeah three of them did
97:22 - you got three clients from 10 to 20
97:24 - outreaches
97:26 - yeah okay because well i
97:29 - and you know i i kind of i kind of knew
97:32 - already who maybe would have wanted to
97:35 - to learn
97:36 - yes and so you know i had already had
97:38 - their phone number anyways because i had
97:39 - known them and i was like hey listen
97:42 - this is what i'm doing how had you
97:45 - already known them
97:47 - where did you get them from two of them
97:50 - are from uh just friends of mine that
97:53 - i've known for a little while who were
97:55 - you know also bartenders looking for
97:56 - something else to do
97:58 - and i said well this is what i'm doing
98:00 - and it's been pretty great
98:02 - so far and they're both like musicians
98:04 - so like artsy type guys
98:06 - so i just kind of like pitched them you
98:08 - know what i have found to be the most
98:10 - enjoyable parts about
98:12 - you know learning how to program and
98:14 - they just got really excited about it
98:16 - and actually the other one was from
98:18 - um pwj with somebody that reached out to
98:22 - me
98:22 - so i had i had two outbound and one
98:25 - inbound so i lied one of them was one of
98:27 - them reached out to me but the other two
98:29 - i got from from reaching out myself
98:31 - that's really smart
98:32 - like with how you're going i really
98:34 - believe that if you actually did
98:37 - 50 outreaches or less i think you can
98:40 - actually get a sale
98:42 - because i think you also have a good eye
98:44 - these numbers are for like
98:46 - literally if somebody was just trying to
98:48 - play the volume game
98:49 - and wasn't even focusing on the quality
98:51 - of messages
98:52 - right but if you're doing a good quality
98:56 - of messages
98:57 - i really believe that with about 50
99:00 - outreaches you can generate
99:02 - a sale so i'm actually gonna
99:05 - do a different type of math for you so
99:07 - like let's say 50
99:09 - outreaches leads to 400 then the
99:12 - question only becomes how long does it
99:14 - take you to do 50 outreaches
99:18 - right um i mean i'm i'm pretty
99:21 - you know i'm i'm not doing much nowadays
99:23 - because my jobs are still close so i'm
99:25 - pretty much home
99:26 - all day working on my computer or
99:27 - working on something so
99:29 - you know i mean it could maybe two days
99:33 - maybe three days to do 50 outreaches
99:36 - why would it take so many days to do 50
99:38 - outreaches
99:40 - uh i suppose just to maybe do a little
99:43 - bit of research and maybe
99:45 - find people to reach out to oh i see
99:49 - yeah okay so let's say so you said how
99:52 - many has two days or three days
99:54 - yeah maybe two or three days okay and
99:57 - would it take
99:58 - eight hours a day uh
100:01 - it could do i mean especially you know
100:04 - if i'm trying to write
100:05 - you know you know i'm a writer too i
100:07 - want my writing to be good i wanted to
100:09 - be
100:10 - you know precisely i'll give you here
100:11 - i'll give you something very incredible
100:13 - for this
100:14 - um and this works really well
100:19 - for like for the starting of an outreach
100:21 - what works incredibly well
100:23 - is one sentence
100:26 - probably max two sentences but like one
100:28 - sentence which is just
100:30 - one or two lines and it's just
100:33 - complement and question so literally
100:36 - for example if i sent a long outreach
100:39 - oftentimes people don't reply because it
100:41 - comes off too salesy and not like
100:43 - regular conversational enough
100:45 - sure so the very simple combination that
100:48 - works extremely effectively is if you do
100:51 - an outreach and you're just like
100:55 - saw that you do this thing saw that you
100:58 - play the guitar or you play the piano
101:01 - and that's
101:02 - freaking amazing how's it going how are
101:05 - you holding up with
101:06 - coronavirus are you are you keeping safe
101:10 - question mark sure something as simple
101:13 - as
101:13 - that can be a thing that you can
101:17 - kind of copy paste of course you're
101:18 - gonna reach out to
101:20 - people you think are likely to actually
101:21 - pay for the service so that might take
101:23 - you some time to find them
101:25 - but yeah the outreach i would highly
101:27 - recommend
101:28 - to not over complicate because that's
101:30 - one area that can you can over
101:32 - engineer and actually the results get
101:35 - worse yeah it makes sense
101:41 - so if you were to do um almost a copy
101:44 - paste
101:45 - outreach but still like personalized to
101:48 - each person
101:50 - and if it was one sentence long
101:53 - how long would it take you to do 50
101:54 - outreaches
101:57 - i mean probably not even a day then
102:00 - okay could we maybe yes how many hours
102:03 - would it take you
102:05 - i i do it within eight i reckon
102:08 - within eight hours within eight hours
102:12 - within eight hours if eight hours paid
102:14 - off to you making four hundred dollars
102:17 - would that be worth it absolutely
102:23 - okay yeah okay
102:27 - and that would put your hourly rate
102:29 - effectively at like 40
102:30 - an hour yeah
102:33 - okay so eight hours let's just say for
102:37 - you
102:37 - equals one sale and as you start to do
102:40 - it more
102:41 - you build more momentum and also
102:44 - oftentimes
102:46 - there's a high chance that those other
102:48 - people you're having conversation with
102:49 - can also turn into a sale so it can it's
102:51 - very possible that your eight hours
102:53 - could result in two or three sales
102:55 - yeah it's also possible that the person
102:59 - that you
102:59 - sell to might book you again after two
103:02 - months
103:04 - yeah yeah yep it's also possible that if
103:07 - you got a few sales
103:09 - you could increase your price so then
103:11 - when you make a sale it's
103:12 - six hundred dollars yeah
103:16 - right okay so
103:19 - the only question is at this point
103:22 - is do you believe
103:27 - this is worth uh your time to do this
103:30 - for eight hours
103:32 - one of these days yeah absolutely
103:35 - hands down no question
103:38 - do you think there's a good day this
103:40 - week for you to
103:42 - try this strategy and see how it goes
103:46 - uh yeah yeah i mean i could uh
103:49 - make a nice day of it on sunday that's
103:51 - for sure
103:51 - [Music]
103:53 - that's dope um i don't know how you do
103:56 - this stuff but like
103:57 - for a day like this i would actually
103:59 - even love to just go and
104:01 - sit at a mall like just people watch and
104:03 - eat food somewhere
104:04 - and just read a book and do this
104:08 - the rest of the time yeah no that sounds
104:10 - that sounds
104:11 - lovely that's amazing so what do you so
104:14 - okay so
104:14 - you you're thinking about doing it
104:16 - potentially this sunday
104:18 - yeah potentially my uh my day is not set
104:22 - in stone yet so i figured uh
104:23 - i could potentially put it in there okay
104:26 - and
104:27 - what where would you like where would
104:30 - you be when you do it
104:33 - um i would probably be at home
104:37 - but there's also a park up the street
104:39 - from my apartment that's
104:40 - probably kind of a ghost town right now
104:42 - so i could go
104:43 - sit up there with some lunch and stuff
104:45 - like that and kind of make a nice little
104:47 - day outside out of
104:48 - it okay
104:52 - so if this is something that you want to
104:54 - get behind this is something that will
104:56 - actually help your life
104:57 - and you want to do
105:01 - can we actually on this call commit to

108:23 - enjoyed it
108:24 - uh a lot going on there right there was
108:26 - a lot to unpack
108:27 - and go through hopefully maybe it gave
108:29 - you some insight
108:31 - into your world when it comes to
108:34 - freelancing or coding or improving your
108:36 - income
108:37 - the thought process that goes behind it
108:39 - but you can if you really break it down
108:41 - systematically and you get extremely
108:42 - precise about your language and precise
108:46 - about
108:47 - how it works then you just need to like
108:50 - follow these very
108:51 - clear simple steps and then you can
108:54 - actually get to the goal
108:56 - that you're trying to get to
109:07 - joseph says so 400 could turn into a
109:09 - twelve hundred dollar day exactly
109:12 - you know that's how i did 1200 cash
109:16 - uh yesterday no different than exactly
109:18 - what i was sharing with
109:22 - patch just blanked out completely
109:26 - but because i've worked on this process
109:28 - for a long period of time and i'm
109:30 - getting inbound leads i'm closing
109:32 - almost 100 to 75 right now which is
109:35 - really really crazy so it's like
109:37 - i got two sales calls and i closed two
109:39 - sales calls
109:41 - and that was twenty four hundred dollars
109:43 - cash and that was
109:45 - one hour of total my time so
109:49 - and revenue wise that was
109:52 - seventy two hundred for two for one hour
109:54 - of my time right so
109:56 - that when you start getting better and
109:59 - better and better
110:00 - at it and you start doing it every
110:02 - single day you can really take it to the
110:04 - next level
110:05 - but just small steps one at a time
110:08 - and then we go from there that's it
110:18 - yeah nikhil yeah need a day you can
110:20 - reach out through email as well
110:22 - that works
110:32 - yeah i have a program where i do this
110:34 - type of mentoring
110:36 - it's called profitable shortcut and
110:37 - that's a really high level
110:39 - program and we this is
110:42 - you know these are the types of things
110:44 - we actually work on
110:46 - and we try to explode people's incomes
110:49 - and
110:49 - really keep taking it to the next level
111:35 - yep nikhil says
111:39 - man want to join the program so badly
111:42 - pwj yeah pwj
111:45 - so we have profit with javascript the
111:46 - one i do mentoring in this profitable
111:48 - shortcut so there are two different
111:50 - programs
111:52 - but i recommend the first program people
111:55 - join is profit with javascript and then
111:57 - if they really want to take you to the
111:58 - next level they can join profitable
112:00 - shortcut
112:02 - all right guys hopefully you guys

Cleaned transcript:

how's it going this is qazi from cleverprogrammer.com welcome to how to make money as a freelance developer and how to make a thousand dollars or more this upcoming month now this is part two and day two of the challenge and we're gonna keep this rocking and rolling for you guys this is about a freelance movement that we're trying to create and we want you all to be a part of it you're not too late and nobody's beginner or too advanced for this you're all you all can be in this together and the entire goal of this movement and it kind of came to me randomly is the goal of this movement is for us to like we want to get to that longterm goal right we all want to get to that like crazy longterm goal that we have of man i wish i could be making this much money or i could be doing this amazing life the goal of this challenge is to take those first steps towards it because oftentimes the steps here are missing and never revealed and it's just like yeah here's how you can make ten thousand dollars a month or something crazy like that but i i care about some of you making your first five dollars this week i care about some of you maybe making your first um fifty dollars this week or five hundred dollars whatever it is for you right that would be super exciting and that's the movement we're creating how can we all increase our income and my focus came on this because i started focusing on increasing my income because i'm like look i'm focusing on all my other goals relationship goals and fitness goals and i'm focusing on team development goals and we have an amazing team with sunny and nas and rishi and yusuf and david and amanath and frankie and aaron we're bringing so much value that's great so content goals are being crushed body goals are being crushed nutrition goals food goals sleep goals health goals but what about my income goals somewhere along the line i felt like i forgot that and that's important for me to keep increasing and i thought why not we all create a movement where we're in it together increasing all of our income does that make sense guys and i hope that that's also exciting to you and welcome everybody that is here man am i pumped to have you guys on here and if you guys can do me a favor and get this video out to as many people as possible just go ahead and smash that like button just break it you know click it maybe a few times but really smash that like button it would do me a huge favor and get this video out to other people and then it will help also transform their lives as well and it's free doesn't cost anything all right with that said let's just jump right into it so amazing let's go here so now right now some far less qualified people than you are living your dreams all because they didn't just talk about it they took action i want you to remember that and i wanna uh show you a few rockstar action takers that are here and part of clever programmer and when that grind payoff baby we show off so it's okay to show off when you put in the hard work all right bragging hard is not a crime here is uh nasir who's actually my 14 year old student and he cleared nine hundred dollars in just one week all right he what's an insane and he actually reached out to me on instagram uh yesterday and he's actually in pakistan okay he's not even in the united states so this is equivalent of somebody making like 9 000 in u.s that's that's how big of a deal that is people make 900 in like six months in pakistan so if he can do it my question is can you also do something can you also make progress can you also make some amount of income even if it's not 900 it's a lot of it is a thing that is in our mind and it kind of blocks us what is up everybody welcome here srikar says he got an internship that's amazing guys whatever you're getting or whatever is happening please make sure that you keep sharing proof of it and you can do it on my instagram you can my instagram is right here so you can actually share with me and we're compiling a document with everybody's results and everybody's wins and how much income everybody's making so far we have over two thousand dollars made that that is documented so far so two thousand dollars have already been made we just started this movement yesterday granted we're taking some of the people who got income from a week before that but that's okay any document income we're gonna we're gonna document it so we're right now at about two thousand dollars and we wanna get to ten thousand and more all right and we're gonna show off every single person who's making income even if it's not as much or you think it's not as impressive um srikar says he sent me proof at my ig okay let's take a look so let's go here let's record all right where is it let's see here um okay i don't see a photo from you bro so i don't see it yet but if i see it then for sure also i'm gonna be taking on callers at some point in this stream so it's gonna be a lot of fun i'm gonna get on a call with some of you guys okay so i'll let you guys know that later right uh regarding yesterday's live stream here's what one of the students had to say schloke and he said regarding so he goes hey man just saw your last video on youtube that said how to earn 1 000 as a freelance developer in 30 days just can't be thankful enough for the value you've provided i would say you just hit the right cords talking about myself i'm a javascript developer having experience of around three years now so to speak for the last 45 days my income has been zero all right so for how many people is this happening where you have some experience and is this you by the way if some of you resonate with what you read so far drop it in the comments below but do you feel like you are coding or learning coding maybe for the last few months or last few years but you really haven't made any income from it maybe you just get caught up with tutorial after tutorial or project after project but no real results with it and he goes i'm pretty confident that i'm going to add value to this challenge and make the best out of it that's a great attitude yep ido city says my guy talk back to me what's up bro all right and i'll add here nice dude i want to be that guy nice okay now i can start showing people's comments as well and he goes i'm sure of sharing income proof as i make progress in coming days so you guys can share proof as well and i've recently asked a question on my g story which no one really gave the answer i was expecting the question you asked what is the best thing money can buy this is exactly what you spotted in the video freedom um basically in the video i said money can buy freedom and that's the ultimate thing that i want with money he goes literally what i'm striving for right now thank you so much for bringing this straight to us love you man awesome okay jennifer stewart says fiverr is a ripoff it really depends what you're doing with it if you don't use it in the right way i mean most of these websites can have that effect right including craigslist obviously so you have to kind of don't give up on it there are people making literally millions of dollars on fiverr it's just a matter of avoiding the quoteunquote ripoff situations right and you get seasoned as you as you do it more uh here's another student that shared with me muhammad shared with me yesterday and he said i didn't register in your course bro but i did follow your tutorials they're amazing after learning react and django through your tutorials i made 1200 since august thanks to you i'm making 400 pretty much every 20 days which is good enough for at my place and again another student in pakistan so that's a lot of income so look at this he made over 1200 and making 400 every month in pakistan right that is absolutely brilliant vanguard said i made 300 in a week by a simple react single page application on fiverr boom there you go that's amazing to hear that just made my day that's awesome and that's the movement we're starting regardless of what your level is i want you to start applying now and start doing things now and building habits now that start making you some amount of income and set your goal to making five dollars this week because that small goal will move you in the right direction for example when you put on your running shoes you don't have to be an amazing person it will just propel you to start getting out of your house to then start running even if you run for 30 seconds right so if you set your goal to something small it'll now start moving in the direction to start wanting to do it absolutely great job that's awesome vanguard um share that with us on instagram as well please that will be amazing sure car says i got 50 building hackathon app that's awesome dope nice okay loving the questions from you guys and the comments so this was somebody watching the live stream from yesterday and taking notes on it so if you guys want to bring something to take notes on i would highly recommend it this would be a very good time to do it and take notes on these things and it's going to bring you a lot of value and here's another student and he says and the rest he goes thank you and the rest of the team community could not have done this without you fingers crossed uh he's our student in pwj brad and brad is like super super awesome so we love having brad in our course profit with javascript and he's just been always hustling he's always reaching out to us on instagram and like messaging us and i just love his energy and if you guys want to take photos like this and tag me guys we re share everybody's story so you can do that and then tag me on ig and i will reshare your stories take pictures like this because this makes it like a real community right this is super cool to see you guys coding and working on things it's even better than just seeing a laptop or a coding screen this is much much much better so take photos like this and tag us all right cool so now i wanna like share with you guys a few things in a little bit and we're gonna go over them and we're gonna start really getting into the meat of what we're gonna be talking about hey this is cool you can actually see the youtube stats and how they're doing so generally when the viewership is going down you know we we know oh crap something bad is happening like what just happened here just drop maybe the internet disconnected or something like that and then when it goes up it's like nice it's working and it seems like you guys are enjoying the content so now here's what i want to share with you guys right work life balance and how can we improve our life and how can we improve our income let me ask you a question are you here to improve your life yes or no another question i want to ask you are you here to improve your income yes or no if those answers are yes that's why we're here that's why we're in this community right and do you want to become a better developer yes or no and if you answer three to all of them that's the entire point of what we do and teach and share at clever programmer and so what i want to do is share with you guys what are the things that are really working for me right now that are helping me improve my body that are helping me optimize my mind that are helping me generate sales and increase my income and helping me crush it with all types of goals so i'm going to share with you guys my day and i do these reflections on my instagram every single day so if you guys ever follow me you will be able to see these reflections but i want to share this with you because my goal is i don't know what's going to happen with the you know there are 193 people watching right now and they're probably going to be thousands of people watching afterwards i don't know what's going to happen with all of them but if there's just one person that can get a transformation out of it or that starts picking up one of these things i think your life is going to improve and that is what excites me and motivates me to do these things and what really excites me is when you guys share with me that you guys are actually doing some of these things and it's helping you all right so i'm gonna now share the screen and we're gonna get to it yo rudolph he says yes yes and yes amazing thomas says yes awesome absolutely matthias texas yes code ninja yes again again beautiful sabir says heck yeah man i love your guys's energy guys we're definitely gonna get on calls uh on this live stream okay so here we go so here is my full work day full day yesterday okay um so i worked out that's the first thing i started my day off with because that's the one thing guaranteed that's going to help move my life forward every single day forever okay so that's something i start my day off with so then i have good momentum next up i had really good food uh consumption yesterday so i'm trying to get my protein up to 120 or 150 grams per day so i ate a lot of good food so whether it was like chicken breasts or protein shakes or salmon whatever it is that i can help fuel and optimize my body now why i say this stuff is important and why i'm even sharing this with you is you're probably sitting there thinking what does food have to do with coding what does food have to do with development well let me tell you something i used to code for long stretches of 13 to 15 hours a day that's why i got so good at coding in such a short amount of time and that's why i was making a hundred thousand dollars a year just six months into my coding experience but what i did that was really bad is i pretty much starve myself the entire time because what would happen when i would eat food is right after i would eat food i would just feel completely sluggish tired and all i would want to do is sleep if you resonate with that drop that in the comments below if you ever feel that where you eat food and then you all you kind of just want to do is just like lay down relax sleep but you don't have the willpower to do crazy things anymore well here's actually what it is when you are hungry and you don't actually eat food for a long period of time literally why your brain is so active is because it's genuinely searching for food so your brain stays sharp when your brain is sharp you can problem solve you can build that project for your client you can um get that job or pass that interview that you were working really hard for does that make sense so people are like yeah how do you get so much how do you even code if you're hungry and not focused so i'm going to answer all these things these are great questions and comments you guys say it says yep it happens to me nice okay nice so here's the thing if you don't know what you're doing with food it's going to actually destroy your productivity and it's going to destroy your income i'm not kidding so what you have to do is either one just avoid food at all costs that's what i started doing but then i started starving myself and started becoming scrawny and i didn't want to be surrounding i want to be jacked i want to be like you know i want to be big and i want to be strong and i want to be healthy so i can be there for my family and my teammates and whatever the case may be right whatever situation i'm in so when it comes to food what i've started doing is i'm now eating lower calories and i'm eating i'm mainly what i'm doing is i'm reducing my carbs and maximizing my protein intake so all that means is i'm from a culture i'm from pakistan right so my family ate a lot of bread and naan and roti and stuff that stuff is so carb loaded that it will mess you up like it makes you want to sleep it's the best food on the planet and like there's no better food than that but all you want to do is just like sleep so what i started doing is i've started cutting a lot of that out so i can just have chicken breasts but without the bread i i just have you know salmon but without really any bread or anything like that without any white rice that what it does is i can now eat and stay healthy but my focus is for very long periods of time so i can actually focus for eight to ten hours a day if i wanted to so i did want to mention that and make it a point because i think that if you guys just made that little tiny switch and what you do it's gonna help you so freaking much all right ahmed is like biryani man biryani is tasty i know bro but that is awesome and amazing but it's gonna you up so that's why i mention it um yeah somebody said sugar shaw effect yeah my girlfriend is into fitness so she helped me as well with this so yeah so i would reduce the carbs like crazy right like right now i'm drinking just pure black coffee and it's absolutely amazing you can't really see it but it's just black coffee um reduce the carb reduce the calories in your day you're going to feel so damn good and you're going to be energized and your income will thank you so wanted to make that a point next up i'm not going to talk too much about this but i have increased my water intake so i always make sure that i'm consistently drinking water throughout the day and then i have my apple watch and i track my water with that it's super easy i just click one button and then i click one button the app is called waterminder so really amazing app but water intake helped me so moving forward i shot my video most of you don't give a about that so that's fine i'm just gonna move past this but this is helpful for me building my brand and me increasing moving towards my goals it's important for me right for you it might be you need to code um for 30 minutes or an hour every day and make it a thing i did the youtube video yesterday and it crushed you guys seemed to love it we got over 10 000 views it provided a ton of value for people so i was happy now here's the other thing that you guys will actually care about um i closed the sale for about 1200 cash yesterday using the phone at about 5 33 p.m now let me ask you guys would you guys be happy if in one day you were able to make twelve hundred dollars in 30 minutes aditya says i was also eating good and working out but then covet happened yes that's exactly what happened to me and it threw me out of the loop but you can't i know you know this but you can't let this be an excuse because it's gonna hurt you from your goals and it's gonna make you a worse person than you are now so you can blame it as much as you want but it's really not going to help you aditya move forward in your life so it was the thing that was stopping me and me up so i hate not doing anything but lifting so i just stopped doing anything but then i started doing a pushup program because i'm like that you can do without weights and um you can still eat healthy food so avoid that from becoming an excuse because it was mine for this entire year and i got fat i gotta start getting fat started getting unhealthy and irritated and angry and yeah all kinds of things that are that are not good all right people are like yeah of course that would i would be the happiest ever right awesome so how did that happen i developed a simple habit of getting on one sales call per day now this twelve hundred dollars is really thirty six hundred dollars because it's a three month payment plan that i close somebody for right that they enrolled in one of our programs but i had to manually get on a call and see what this person needed and if what they need if we couldn't help them with what they need then i would be like okay we don't have anything that's good for you but if it was something that we could help them with then i said hey yes we do have a program and then they would have to make a decision at that point to say yes or no to my services does that make sense guys so for you what that would look like is if you have a service like you can help somebody learn how to code or if you can help build something for somebody with code then you would get on a call and you would have a 20 to 30 minutes exchange of words you would exchange words with them like ask them a question listen ask them a question listen ask them a question listen and then 30 minutes in you'd be like hey i have something for you that might be able to help you are you interested in hearing more they're like yes then you go okay well i have a 30 day 60 day 90 day mentorship program where i'll teach you how to code and improve your skills this is how much it's gonna cost you could have it be three hundred dollars hundred dollars fifty dollars it doesn't matter you could have it be three thousand or four thousand dollars right that's that's what i'm doing so you could have it be that and if the person sees value in it then it's their decision whether they want to say yes or no you're not holding anybody to a gun point you are having a genuine conversation and then you're saying hey i think we have something for you do you want it yes or no and then it's just their decision but what i can control on my end in order to improve my income is i can just develop a good habit to focus on cash and income and sales generating strategies does that make sense so this is why it all comes down to habits right if you want to improve your body good water good food good exercise habits right these three habits will improve your health you guys agree with me or disagree right when it comes to improving your income if you can get on a sales call every single day just one it's going to improve your income does that make sense awesome nikhil says agreed sir car says yes yep you can blame the tides or you can go with them right totally agree with you totally agree cool yes garveet i do listen to audible quite a bit yep okay so uh and and uh any mods please just go ahead and block anybody that's um that's just saying dumb like keep the chat clean otherwise we're just gonna block you from the chat so that is important all right so this is a habit that you guys can develop too maybe you guys can develop a habit of hey i'm gonna do a few outreaches every single day two to three outreaches every single day it could be tiny it could be really small make sure it's something that takes you less than two minutes to do it but something that you do every single day so i'm going to ask you guys later what's a habit that you can get into all right cool so let's move forward here um and then yep i i read a book at the end which is right over here right cool this is the app i use to keep track of my streaks so things i want to make habits yeah so it's a habit tracker app so you can see it's tracking my gym 21 days in a row shower video content days i'm taking my protein and days i'm doing sales calls it's actually tracking all of these things right so you can see i wrote them all down here so you guys can do the same thing where you can track whatever habits are important to you and then boom over the next few days you see incredible results would you guys like to see amazing results in your life and maybe it's not twelve hundred dollars but hey what if you made a hundred and twenty dollar sale wouldn't that be cool that would be 120 extra that you made now imagine if you could make 120 every single day well what happens when you make 120 dollars every single day multiply that by seven days that's 840 in one week multiply that by four and now you found a way to generate 300 3 360 worth of extra income than you were making now depender is asking me a great question and he said hey uh that makes sense but how do you get these sales calls how do you pitch yourself anywhere so that's a good question so let's talk about that you can go on fiverr or upwork or linkedin or instagram or facebook groups or wise ant or take lessons or craigslist the 10 platforms that i just mentioned and you can do outreach on them and you can reach out to your target ideal client so for example people who would be interested in learning coding you can reach out to them you can have a conversation with them and you can say hey you know start a conversation with them and then just be like hey would you be interested in learning coding and improving your skills if they're like yes or you're like hey would you be interested in making a project like this would react and they're like yes would you be open to getting on a short call if they say yes now you've just gotten on a sales call and now your habit for the day is done and on that call you speak with them for 30 minutes to learn about their goals and then at the end you just say hey if you're interested i have a service that i think could help you and then wait for their permission to continue and if they're like yes what is it then you can have a conversation about it you could be like this is how much it is it's how much it costs and i think it'll really help you and then you just wait for them to say yes or no if they say no nothing changed in your life you're still the same person if they say yes you've now generated an extra 50 extra 100 extra thousand dollars all right and boom now you're actually making an income and now you're actually have extra income for whatever you really want to use it for right so this is um what what's important for you guys too right so for example personally me i've cleared 4 400 cash so i want to make myself accountable too so if we're all trying to increase our income i'm like okay let me get in there manually with everybody else and we can all go together and we're all at different levels right so i'm here and i'm like okay i've cleared 4 400 cash this week just over the phone using my phone okay and i've probably spent an hour hour and a half max right so would you like to make 4 400 an hour and a half yes or no in the comments below let me know and now imagine clearing clearing 4 400 in one week with this device with this device that we all have right here there's no excuse it's right literally right here right and in total the revenue is actually 9 200 because this is the cash that was generated but what's going to be collected later over the period of three months when it gets paid out it's going to be 9 200. so imagine clearing almost 10 000 in an hour and a half with three calls would that be powerful for you would that be helpful for you right so this is what i want you to understand the power of these habits you guys fitness just eat clean exercise for income just get on sales calls one sales call a day one sale call a week some kind of habit some kind of habit because i know for most people it's zero which makes sense why they're making zero extra dollars and they normally would small habits are insane i encourage if you want to go down the rabbit hole of the habits i recommend you read the book atomic habits absolutely fantastic lifechanging for me got me you know going and like really destructuring everything i do all right so those are the lifechanging apps i use right and i already show you guys what they are and i'm going to show you what these apps are called if you guys want them so do you guys want me to share these apps with you by the way or i can skip this portion if you guys want but if you think that these apps would be valuable i'd be happy to share them with you guys i like that uh angels so so small habits are insane or actually sane make up your mind that's funny i like it matea says yes please share uh hell yeah okay cool production says sure so here it is so you guys can get this app this app is called done you can have it on your iphone i i think this is a pretty amazing app um you can use it to quit habits or build habits i'm only using it to build habits and for me it's uh workouts and a few other ones that i've already listed out protein and stuff like that you can make it work out in code and then whatever else you want right so this app is a good app and i'm gonna move forward this is a really good app and i recommend that you all get it because if you want to increase your financial skills and you want to know how you're doing here's the thing right if you want to decrease your weight you have to check your weight if you don't track your weight it's going to be really hard for you to decrease your weight because you're going to be just going all over the place so just like when it comes to your body weight you need to track it to drop it with your money it's the same way if you want to increase your money you better track your money and there's only one number that i personally care about that i want to share with you and you can write this down as well for yourself that's more important than anything is this word right here okay this is the only thing i want you guys to use this is one number that'll tell you about all your financial health and so we'll we can practice on this live stream right here actually net worth this is the one number i want you to care about and know and you don't have to know about any other number all this means and i'm not talking about the crazy net worth where you're like trying to figure out how much your house is worth and your car is worth no no i just mean how much cash do you have in bank versus how much money do you have on your credit cards so for example let's say you had like you know three different credit cards let's say you had three different credit cards and you know on this credit card you had like one thousand dollar debt and then another credit card you had two thousand dollar debt and then let's say you had a bank account where you had five thousand dollars in their cash okay so what would your net worth be can anybody guess your net worth would be positive two thousand dollars that's your net worth that's the only number i want you to care about if i knew this number i know about your financial health i don't care about all of this crap i just want to know this number right here so for those of you guys who actually want to take action and change things what i want you to do is go ahead and in the comments below i want you to actually write what your net worth is so in the comments write what your net worth is for some of you for a lot of people is actually negative it's actually a lot of times negative like 5 000 or negative 10 000. for most people it's negative so if you find it negative and you don't want to share it don't be embarrassed about it just share it because you're going to give it too much power and then it makes it hard for you to actually increase your income and ability to make money code ninja says 2000 the clip zone says zero amorous has about 300 euro uh usad says 1500 ashwag says uh 35 000 indian rupees if you guys can do me a huge favor and turn it all into usd for me please because that'll help me understand and maybe even give you insight but just please convert it into usd for me that'll really help zayn says nine thousand dollars victor says 27k 500. yep and what i want you to do if you're serious about changing your life and your income forever i want you to look at this one number every day and stop being scared of it or embarrassed about it any of that eric says around negative forty five thousand student loans a lot of people that happens with them student loans become a thing right negative three k for canenza ashfox says 466 dollars and do this tech 475 dollars preowned just 24. nice but you're positive bro graph dev says 300k negative 300k holy crap wow what do you open up to thousand four hundred forty four zero zero okay cool so now here's what i wanna say for you guys okay the only thing i want you guys to track when it comes just know your net worth that's it and if you actually use this app personal capital it's so easy all you have to do is just put in your uh like your credit cards and your you know whatever checking account and it will just tell your net worth right at the top here it makes it so easy you guys see this right here net worth boom it just gives you what your net worth is right there and you can actually even see a graph so what you want to see is you want to see a graph of your net worth going up all right um graph says that's why i'm changing the type of my business what business are you doing right now 9000 usd when moon says yep so you want this guys to be increasing forever that's what you want all right and you want it to be where every quarter or every few months this says something positive like you had a positive change in your net worth but the first step is to track it so what i normally do right rukaya is excited so what i do is i have um i have a folder all the way at the bottom called finance hopefully you guys can see it right and you can see personal capital is right there in the middle right and i check that pretty much every single day i'll get on it and i'll log in it needs to either see my face or have me type in the password i'll get on and i'll go and look and i'll be like okay cool so i see my trend overall it's been positive that's a really good sign at one glance i can see that one number that gives me my entire financial health know this one number if you just know this number guys you are good in life you are so good and you're going to only move forward if you make money complex you're going to run away from it and it's going to make your life so difficult and so so hard just know this one number net worth and just keep making it go up that's it and you're good to go okay that's one of the really important things i can share with you most senses 2k awesome all right so whether you're in positive or negative no worries guys give yourself a pat on the back you're in it you're investing in yourself you're on this youtube live stream you're watching this you're commenting and you're already engaging in this all right so now it's time for you to start taking action and moving it forward but don't develop shame or guilt around looking at this thing most people have a lot of shame and guilt when it comes to their income so they have a really poor relationship with it if you have a poor relationship with it it's going to feel awful too you're never going to want to look at it it's going to be like punishment so work on changing your relationship with it and how it feels because if you're at negative 6 000 like somebody said your um chances are you're gonna be like really screwed for a really long time because you're gonna hate looking at it if you hate looking at it you're never gonna wanna change your income so you're gonna stay at negative 6k whereas somebody who's in positive like 3k or 8k or 10k and did like looking at it they're going to go from 10k to like 100k whereas the person who's at negative 6 is going to stay at negative 6. but if you start enjoying the process of looking at it and going from negative six or this week i'm gonna go from negative six to negative six thousand to let's say negative five thousand nine hundred that's cool i improved by a hundred bucks i'll go from negative five thousand nine hundred to negative five thousand six hundred this next week cool i sold some stuff and i'm like down to that boom you guys are gonna keep moving forward i'm gonna try to apply for some developer jobs or some developer gigs on these platforms damn i'm at negative four thousand now damn i'm a negative two thousand now oh i'm at positive two thousand oh i'm at ten thousand damn momentum feels great but if you don't track it it's not gonna improve cool awesome let's keep it moving if you guys don't have this app exactly then find some other app that's relevant to this um this is another app that i use this really really helpful for me it's called life some and this is the one where i track my food and calories and everything and it's helping me lose weight and just get very healthy and fit and get my mind right so and the the ui of this is just fantastic if for no other reason you get this app but just to see what a phenomenal user experience looks like a user interface looks like as a developer this is the app to check out and study all right let's move forward now winners and losers often have the same goals so i wanted to share with this with you guys because a winner wants to make a million dollars and also a loser wants to make a million dollars what separates the two a winner developer wants to make 5 000 a month and a loser developer also wants to make 5 000 a month what separates the two here's the thing if you completely ignored your goals and focused only on your system would you still succeed for example let me see if i can zoom in on this more nah i can't okay if you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to win a championship and focused only on what your team does at practice each day would you still get results i think you would so here's the thing winners and losers have the same goals the only difference between winners and losers is process that's it that's the only difference winners actually follow a process that will get them that result losers go up and down and do a lot of random things right so losers do random stuff like this and then they get discouraged and they don't get results and they quit right whereas a winner will be like hey i gotta get to here so i'm gonna do this and this this and this and now look i got here all right so for you guys it's the same way the this is why i'm pushing you guys to make five dollars this week or ten dollars as a freelancer this week and then share those wins okay let me go here and this is something i've been getting pretty into and getting pretty excited about which is like making making money a habit right so if you can actually make making money a habit how insane is that like literally you can make generating revenue a habit by the way if you haven't already smashed that like button guys do it because it's gonna help the video go out to more people and habits are very simple you got cue craving response reward all right so a queue is you smell food craving is you can experience what that chicken or what that biryani or whatever it is that's amazing is gonna taste like in your body so you start craving it and then the response means you your action so then you go to an actual restaurant to purchase that same food that you were craving for let's say it's chicken and french fries and then your reward is the dopamine hit like once you eat it it's that dopamine hit that you get after eating it right so that's your that's how habits work so you can make making money as a developer a habit you can actually give yourselves cues and cravings you're not gonna in the start have a craving if you don't do something you actually don't have a craving so it looks like this if you look at the dopamine in the start it actually everything is like flatlined and then as soon as you get the reward boom you're like wow that feels amazing so then this is graph like let's say one then what it looks like in graph two if i made graph two salman thank you for the five dollar donation he says really loving this content i built a react resume and portfolio video series too that's amazing thank you brother appreciate it man patel says i just got my first client with 250 for making a wordpress site yes so we got 300 plus 250 amazing 550 made just on this stream that's epic thanks for sharing that and um i will actually screenshot it see if i can send it to david cool cool cool cool cool all right cool so let's go here now graph two actually looks like this because you already have gotten a reward now you get that dopamine hit during the craving phase so for example something will cue you and you will start craving and you will get that dopamine hit then you will like go and take the response to do it meaning you'll take the action to do it and then you'll get the reward and you'll be like pretty excited about it right so you'll only start to develop a craving for something once you've already gotten reward from it and that dopamine hit so what does that mean that means until you get your first few sales and you make some money you're not gonna crave it you're not gonna be able to develop sales calls or outreaching as a developer into a habit until you actually go through the process and you get that sale but once you get that sale and you get that dopamine hit of what it feels like to make a thousand dollars or 250 dollars oops well then now the next time you can actually anticipate it and crave it in anticipation and then it will start becoming a more and more of a habit that makes sense i got my first few clients from platforms like why is that take lessons and craigslist so that cool all right um if you guys really want something to be a habit you guys can actually stack it with something you guaranteed do so for example i know guaranteed i wake up so i this was a new habit so i'm going to actually say new habit right and this over here waking up is an old habit so habit stacking means you can actually chain your habits so you can take an old habit and connect the new habit with it and now that new habit becomes your habit so for you if it's like you can you can you can make it so you have the habit of oh thank you so much thank you so much baby appreciate it so you can have the habit of waking up and then you could do doing outreach or uh going on fiverr and doing outreaches that make sense so you can chain them together this is your old habit and this is your new habit and now they're chained and if you do that for 60 to 80 days it'll become something you start craving and you'll feel weird if you don't outreach on fiverr or upwork or freelancer.com or whatever the platform is right it'll actually become weird cool so habit one habit two habit we have before you can stack them you can chain them it'll make you likely to do them more right so for example example after i pour my morning cup of coffee i will meditate for 60 seconds so go ahead right now in the comments below because i care more about transformations i'm not interested in here to actually give you content i want to help you guys actually make a difference in your life so in the comments below i want you guys to go ahead and write what's the new habit that you're going to develop that'll help you make more money as a freelance developer that's one and two what habit are you going to chain it with so write a full sentence like right now because otherwise what's the point of watching this right what's the point of us being here so let's actually use this to do something positive so we can make an impact in our own income and in our own life because that is exciting so write down below for you what that actually means what's that new habit that you're going to develop and i'm going to start reading it out loud and in a little bit we'll start doing calls as well okay so we got somebody saying all right so we got garveet sings i will drink a gallon of water every day okay amazing priyanshu says i will meditate and post on instagram amazing saeed says wake up and have exercise awesome matea says swap social media with upwork that's brilliant that will help you make guaranteed more money guaranteed just that's what i mean you're saying that you're probably gonna still use social media that's really hard to just give up social media so that's not really habit stacking because you're making uh like that's something you're using willpower to say right now but you're gonna run out of that willpower and you're gonna go back to eventually just using social media of course if you could do this and stick to it then unbelievable results would happen for you but what i would rather have you say is chain um i would rather have you chain your you know upwork to you doing something like you brush your teeth and right after you're done brushing your teeth you can say hey i'll go on upwork because right now you won't have a queue to go on upwork you'll have no cue you're you're you're never even gonna think about going on upwork that's the thing so you got to create your own cue leonard says wake up and watch lectures in university great that's awesome uh the technical technic filer says one enhance my skills twos i will two i will reduce my laziness that those are not habits you can't just do that you can't just go i'll just reduce my i'll increase my willpower you can't just do that so that's not gonna do anything for you waking up at 4 am okay dope that's good we'll put two to three hours every day apart from my job from now on to build my portfolio and will full throttle on increasing my net worth awesome wake up and read a book also awesome that's cool awesome so these are good guys as long as you do these you're going to be on track to for greatness a lot of you still are not talking about how you're going to increase your income as a developer so if you don't talk about how you're going to do that your income is not going to increase and if you clicked on this video i imagine that's probably to increase your income so i'm happy for your lifestyle and health goals but i do want you guys to also talk about what your plan is to increase your income what habit you're going to develop i will check up work after i wake up or maybe there's another thing that you guaranteed do every day i don't know what it is maybe you work every day maybe you so you can be like i'm gonna check this after i get off work or right before i go to work so take something you do guaranteed and then chain it after or before it the new habit that you're trying to create digazo says i've joined people per hour yesterday that's awesome now are you doing outreach on there because if you're not doing outreach you're not going to actually get clients so i want you to actually develop some kind of action plan and do that every day i've applied to people per hour patch says why is that upwork take lesson started the process of reaching out to freelancing clients awesome so patch can you actually make that a habit of outreaching and maybe even set a time on in a day so it's something you do guaranteed every single day and then it's just chained to your day so it could either be chained to you waking up it could be chained to you working out it could be chained to i don't know you after you play your guitar every day could like whatever it is die gaza says my question is what strategy follows should i take aggressive technique and send requests all the time so don't spam but start conversations start sales conversations that's what i want you guys to focus on so what does that look like compliment and question that's how you start a conversation with somebody compliment question so for example you go on somebody's instagram or you reach out to somebody and you're like haha that's amazing i love what you're doing right now with juggling or i love what you're doing right now with surfing that looks dope are you are you staying safe during corona question mark now boom you've just created a conversation after a few text messages like literally one or two more you can say you can change it to like what's your goal right now with coding what's your goal right now with this but you guys don't have to even do that right now on instagram and platforms like linkedin that's a little bit more advanced you can but i would recommend you just go on people per hour and craigslist where they're very transactional marketplaces and you can actually be much more aggressive in your approach because people understand that you're trying to give them a service yep on those platforms outreach and just be like hey i can actually help you with your code or yes for five dollars i will do some project or for fifty dollars i'll do some project so small but i want you guys to collect wins zainab says that's amazing she goes i say i wake up meditate tell myself nothing is impossible and get to coding at least two hours before i attend my classes that's awesome your well wisher says can i pay an installment for profit with javascript course yes i think if in the description if you click you can pay in installments for profit with javascript there's three installments all right let's see what we got okay right so this is an example of an outreach oh sorry so here is an example of an outreach right over here right compliment this is somebody else's this is not me outreaching but basically she saw this girl as lifting so she's like that's so strong that's a compliment right and then uh dang i missed the barbell haha so now it's like relating to that person right so basically this whole thing is kind of like a compliment and then question so compliment question works really well to start a conversation with somebody and these are the platforms that you guys have wise ant take lessons people per hour code mentor craigslist now it's your job to hammer that and apply to like 40 a day or 100 a day that's your job right that's where you have to set your own daily goals and you have to set your own daily habits i can't do that for you i can't want it more for you i'm sharing with you what i'm doing that's resulting in 1200 to 3 000 or more extra cash every single day my goal is to keep sharing this with you guys and take my own personal income to a run rate of two million or three million dollars per year that's my goal your goal can be i'm gonna take my income to fifty thousand or sixty thousand dollars you can come with me and we can go together and increase our income i'll keep sharing with you the advanced tactics and strategies and tricks and tips and techniques that are working for me then it's up to you how you use it you can

know i'm trying to get my profiles looking nice and pretty before i start submitting you know want to make that good first impression okay awesome so you're working on your profiles right now yeah and then i just had uh i just got my third client my two third tutoring client today um which has been great um i've been loving teaching and tutoring and um you know just looking to build my skills up and just solidify the skills i already do have and uh just just get better man i want to just get i want to be so good i can't be ignored if they say in the entertainment industry cal newport says that too in his books um okay so i'm just gonna write some of this stuff down here okay so you have how many clients currently i currently have three three clients currently okay and how much are they paying you uh two of them are 25 an hour and one of them is 30 an hour okay 30 an hour okay and how many hours are you generally doing every week with them by the way congratulations that's awesome but go ahead oh thanks man yeah yeah um uh you know it's been a little it's not like you know monday wednesday friday we have a call it's just kind of i just kind of tell them like whenever you guys are available how much how much have they how much have you generated so far is it like 50 bucks is it a hundred bucks like from yeah it's 50 bucks so far yeah got it okay and are you pl so now okay so you don't have planned followed up sessions with them um i mean i tell them you know whenever you guys i just kind of like leave it up to them for now which i'm not sure is the right approach but i'm just kind of like all right you know when do you want to do your next lesson so i pose that question and then you know they'll either say you know when you available and be like i'm available tomorrow all right let's do it tomorrow so um i just kind of like put the ball in their court which again i'm not sure is the correct approach but you know i also don't want to like make them feel forced um so you know again i don't know if that's the correct approach but that's what i've been going with so far okay cool so this is not the best approach because you're putting a ball in their court but what you're not realizing is they're putting the ball in your cord gotcha so until somebody just takes a ball and starts doing something with it nothing will really happen right um like for i'll give you an example right when i book my uh like i i work out with adrian right i don't know if you see him on my instagram stories but he's yeah miller muscle or something right miller muscle exactly so i trained with him right yeah so when i was gonna book a session with him i only did one session but before he left he closed me for 10 followup sessions okay um and in that moment i was like what the like i kind of just he was like when do you want to do the next one and i was like yeah you know i'll hit you up he's like how about uh we do 10 you know we booked 10 i'm like that sounds cool uh yeah i'm like just follow up with me later and we can take it from there and he he asked me he goes yeah let's just go ahead and venmo it right now and then go from there and i was like damn all right he got me i was like all right cool let's just do it all right so i venmoed him and paid him for the 10 upcoming sessions but guess what do you think i'm happy right now that we have 10 sessions booked in advance or i'm pissed right i see what you're saying see what i'm saying so like yeah i am happy that he made me pull the trigger because every single time i'm done with one of those sessions i'm like yes and i like watch myself grow because if i didn't if he hadn't done that i wouldn't book 10 sessions i would just do one and then like it would just be airy fairy and everything would get lost and i would not be getting the results i want in my kickboxing skills or fitness skills sure so i'm thankful that he closed me right yeah no that that that that makes a lot of sense um um you know and then also what i have told them is like you know i don't want you guys to book i actually said i don't want you guys to book 10 lessons in advance and then not have the time to do them and they just kind of like back themselves up and stuff like that but um i guess i'll have to sort of like reformat that a little bit well they don't have to book the times in advance right true yeah it's a good point they can keep the time flexible that's what adrian does for example the time will be flexible so you know like if you like i'll give you an example right even the we have a 90day program if we don't have a 90day transformational program nobody's going to want to do more than just a few calls because they people get confused or lost they can't see the slow progress right like if you want to get somebody to hear and if they're excited about getting to this goal um i think my screen will show you in about 30 seconds or whatever because you're probably behind but if somebody wants to get to some high level goal right they're not gonna see all the small steps that they take to get there but they're gonna realize once they're there they're like oh now i can do this that's sick these these small steps here are like maybe let's say 12 sessions you had with them right so especially as somebody who's not there yet where they want to be they're not going to know what they need to get there so it's actually not their job to figure that out their job is to pay you to figure that out right so for example you see what i'm saying so for example for you the there are multiple ways you can make more income right and let's just brainstorm together what are ways you can improve your income right now uh well joining all the uh joining all the websites like people per hour and wise and upwork and all that stuff and reaching out to you know seeing a job and you know sending in an application for it or you know posting stuff on instagram or facebook or pretty much i feel like it's whatever whatever method you can do to show people that they can trust you with you teaching them what it is they want to learn got it whatever whatever format that is i'm sure it's different for everyone but those are the just particular ways that i like to do it got it so basically one way you can increase your income is by increasing the volume of outreach right yep so one is just volume what is another way you could increase your income um uh i don't know um you know making a website or like you know not necessarily reaching out but just putting yourself out there like you know here's my you know here's my portfolio gonna still throw that in the outreach column for volume okay cool um so what about yeah what what if you doubled your the rate that you charge would that increase your income oh sure yeah yeah yeah definitely so that's another way right yep so if you doubled your price you would double your income pretty much overnight yep okay cool um is there any other way we could increase your income type of way okay i was gonna say i don't know if this falls in the same category but you know booking people for sort of like a package deal on lessons rather than one at a time yes exactly so selling packages that's brilliant that's really smart okay so you could do a package deal instead of oneoffs so when you set package deal what i want you to focus more on is um and this is gonna help boost your income and take you into four or five figures very very quickly but it's so there's one off and then they're packaged deals right i want you to think of in terms of transformation deals okay sort of like sort of like you know a result based package if you will like if you take this program then you know in 10 lessons i'll you know make you a master of javascript or whatever yep so like understand what their goal is and understand their language and frustration point so you're not projecting your language and your goals right if they're saying my goal is to master the part of you know the basics of javascript like that's really frustrating for me then if your program can help them with that then now it's a transformation deal like this is a it's a 10 10 sessions but it's like a transformation package deal right okay yeah cool okay and you could even so now what's the benefit of a package you know versus oneoffs um well a package would sort of guarantee you the money up front and it would be in tune with you know something more sort of consistent and guaranteed rather than you know just do it whenever you feel like that inconsistency yes and consistency and reliability is actually a huge thing that a lot of freelancers don't know how to get to but right they want to get to that and and and you know correct me if i'm wrong but i feel like that's a big that's a big you know sort of that's very much interwoven with your ability of your soft skills and stuff like that correct right absolutely so okay so now we have really good ways we got uh now can you tell me which ways are if we had to put them in difficulty which way is easy medium or and hard so like these three that we have right now outreach 2x your price transformation deal uh i feel like i feel like just flip package deal and reach out because the package deal i feel like is always going to be the harder sell because it's more money up front but and you know the two times the price is you know it's obviously more money but it's not so when i say when i say difficult i mean uh in terms of like you effort that it requires from you oh right right so for example which one of these is high effort requiring versus low effort requiring that's what i mean with easy and hard gotcha uh well then probably the reach out would be the most difficult because it just requires more emails more writing more you know more research and stuff like that to find the people that reach out to you so that's the hard one which ones are is there any other ones that are also hard or are they medium or easy and which ones are uh i feel like you know i feel like as is then as it's written i mean i've been that you know the package deal will be the easiest because if you know you sell them you sell one person on a 10 lesson package then there's you know 500 bucks right there um so i feel like that's probably the easiest in terms of like how to bring in income um but you know at the same time the 2x the prices sort of feels like the same kind of thing except just on a smaller scale yep so yeah so what would you put the 2x sub pricing would you put that as easy thing that requires it's easy in terms of the effort that it requires on your end is it hard or medium uh i i'd say it's i'd say i wanna i want to say medium um but uh just because you know it's only one lesson uh i mean it could be more it could be one lesson or it could be doubling the price of your transformation deal like your entire package deal right so and do you want to hear my thoughts on this definitely yeah so i agree with you on the outreach it's the most difficult and it's uh very vague as well it's like very ethereal it's like intangible right now between these other two the one that i think is the easiest personally is the pricing it takes almost zero effort on your end the only effort it takes on your end that when it's time to say the price instead of saying the word uh 50 you have to say the word 100 right so effort wise it's actually the least effort taking so it's like the easy it doesn't mean you it will work doesn't mean you have to do it but effort wise i think that increasing the price is the easiest thing to do it's very low effort on your end yeah um the package one i would say is like easy or medium because you have to actually come up with what the transformation is like then you have to actually pitch what the transformation is you have to actually have a sales call so like that takes a little bit more effort makes sense but yeah and i think in the ballpark like we're on the same page so um okay so this is good now the one thing i want to uh speak with you about here is when you talk about reaching out it's uh it's a random cloud of things and i want to help give you some clarity in there okay because this is where a lot of people get lost with the with the outreach so i want you to become very precise with this and i'll help you work backwards so let's say we want to get the tren let's start with the sale first and then we'll work backwards from there so how much would you want to charge with your let's say a transformation deal first of all how many sessions would this transformation deal be um i think you know somewhere between eight to ten i reckon would be a good would be a good starting point okay eight to ten sessions i love that great and how much would you charge total for it like let's just say it's ten sessions yeah so i would normally um you know 30 bucks an hour is just for one hour you know that would so that would be let's say 300 for for 10 sessions but i feel like you know there's potentially more value in a transformation package as opposed to just a oneoff lesson here and there yes so i mean i could i could feel it being justified and saying you know i know i'm 30 bucks an hour but you know you pay 400 for 10 lessons which equates to 40 bucks an hour you're ultimately sort of you know quote unquote getting guaranteed results as opposed to you know because this is what i offer in this package and if you believe that i can do it then yeah buy the package but you know if you don't believe i can do it then you know we'll just do oneoff lessons here and there yep so in this you're focusing on the results you're also focused you can also tell them hey you can reach out to me through text whatever questions you have right so cool so we can do so this will be 10 sessions for example okay i'm just going to write 10 s and that's what that will signify okay cool so 10 sessions for 400 i love that i think that's actually really good starting point and i think that's very possible now working backwards from here what i mean is let's work backwards to how we can get to that 400 right so okay so we got the sale is 400 now in order for the sale to happen what is the action that you need to do what's the what's the action that happens right before the money goes into your bank account what's what's the action that that happens like you know the the you know the contact with the client or something like that or that exactly sales call the physical sales call right yeah so this is actually the closest thing this is the action that actually generates revenue in your bank account right cool so now we'll work backwards from there as well right so okay so this if this is the last step and then this is let's just say sales calls like the second last step right um what happens before the sales call what do you need to do in order to get on a sales call like what's the step that happens before the sales call general generally the the reaching out to the client and seeing if they would be interested in something like this and asking them if they wanted to get on the phone for a chat and i can tell them what it's all about and what i'm offering and stuff so is it the outreach or is it the conversation in the dms which one is it is the outreach the outreach which leads to the conversation in the dms which leads to the sales call so the step that's right before the sales calls is actually the conversation in the dm yeah yep so it's like so i'll just say dms okay and then what's the thing that happens in order to get so so basically correct me if i'm wrong in any area or just let me know if i'm right so far so we're having we're in the dms we're having a conversation then we generate a sales call then we get on the sales call then we pitch the program and 400 is just cash chaching just hit our bank account so far so good yeah so what's the action that happens before we can actually get into dms uh well you find the you know for example somebody that wants to learn and you know you happen to offer what they're looking to learn and then you just say hey you know so it still is a dm but it's like a different level of a different type of dm it's like hey are you open to this conversation so it's kind of like sort of the investigation into the potential client yeah but yeah so what's happening right before the dms is you're actually before a conversation takes place you're actually out reaching to multiple people right and then only one of those people chooses to have a conversation with you right so right before dms is it fair to say that the thing that you're actually doing is outreach and when i say outreach i mean you say hey hey like text messaging 5 10 20 different people that's what i mean specifically by outreach is it fair to say right before conversations in the dms uh outreach takes place yeah okay so outreach okay so now we've gone it down to a fourstep process right outreach conversation sales call cash and bank yep okay cool so with this outreach thing there are two different types of outreach there is an inbound and then there's outbound do you know the difference between the two uh uh well outbound would maybe be you reaching out and inbound would be them seeing your profile and reaching out correct so when you make content the only purpose of that content is to generate what types of inbound or outbound uh inbound yeah the whole point of creating content aka when people lightly use the term putting myself out there or they say something the whole point is to generate inbound interest right um but but you can always be doing outbound because that never ends that pool is like unlimited right yeah but you always have to make sure you're making forward progress because you can outreach to a million people but if you never actually start a conversation in the dms will you ever lead to making 400 in cash no if you reach out to a million you have a million conversations going but you don't do a single sales call will you ever hit 400 cash in bank no no so it's less about how many are we doing is more about how many are actually completing the entire process and getting to the pitch on a sales call right right so generally what i'll tell you is if you have a regular sales script if you are like a average person with the average like somewhat sensical sales script you can close 20 of the people that you get on a call with not bad so we'll do some reverse math in there right so basically to make one sale how many calls would you need to get on patch five perfect so we would need to get on five sales calls in order to generate four hundred dollars you agree with me yep cool now in order to get on five sales calls how many conversations in the dms would we need to be having in order to generate those sales calls so i'll give you this generally uh what i've seen is 10 of the convos will ever get to a sales call if you're doing a good sales script in the dms so how many conversations would you need to have to generate one sales call so how many to just generate one sales call uh 10 about 10. yup so 10 i'll write this where my face doesn't block it so 10 dms will equal one sales call right yeah so in order to generate five sales calls how many conversations would you need to have going to generate 10 sales calls about 50 right i'm sorry to generate um five sales calls five generate five sales calls if 10 leads to a sales vote yeah about 50 right yes correct so you would need to have 50 conversations ongoing in order to do five calls and on those five calls you could sell something for four hundred or thousand or two thousand or three thousand three thousand is where it gets like a little bit more difficult but you could definitely sell something for one thousand to two thousand and let's go one step back in order to generate 50 conversations how many outreaches would we need to be doing so i i will say it like this i'll say honestly if you do a good job and you're not just spamming people 10 of the people you outreach should start should turn into a conversation so that's what i would say so how many outreaches would we need to do to get one conversation going uh about 50 10 of them will turn so um you would need to do let me see if i could rephrase it one out of every 10 people you reach out to turn into a conversation in the dms right so to generate one conversation in the dms you would need to do 10 outreaches i i'm like you see what i'm saying okay yeah yeah right okay so 10 let me write it the other way so 10 outreach is equal to one dm convo ongoing cool all right so then in order to get 50 convos going now you would actually need to do quite a lot of work right 10 times that would be like 10 times 50. so you would need to do about 500 outreaches to get 50 convos if that makes sense right yep yep okay okay cool so this sounds like a this is like a lot of volume in my experience if you're doing good outreach generally 30 of the people will reply to you and if you're doing really good dms like 30 percent of the people will actually get on a call with you so you can reduce the number like crazy if you're not spamming like if you don't spam you don't have to do 50 outreaches you can actually do 20 outreaches and generate a sale right like it's really crazy how effective it can be if you take the time to actually personalize your messages but this is like yeah go ahead no i was just saying i really don't like spamming either because you know people have done it to me before and it's annoying so i would never want to do it to someone else exactly like yeah exactly so plus plus it shows you know more personality and the fact that you took the time to personalize the message i think means a lot more yep it does it means a lot for people and that's why the results also show you know if you actually do that it's completely worth the time and energy to do that so basically 500 outreaches will lead to one sale and then that's one customer you can work with on a recurring basis even after the recession is over you could do it again now to do 500 outreaches i think that it can take about if you're focused how long would it take to do betw um you know how many outreaches have you done by the way total uh i mean probably about 10 to 20 so far somewhere in there and how many did any of them lead to sales for you um yeah three of them did you got three clients from 10 to 20 outreaches yeah okay because well i and you know i i kind of i kind of knew already who maybe would have wanted to to learn yes and so you know i had already had their phone number anyways because i had known them and i was like hey listen this is what i'm doing how had you already known them where did you get them from two of them are from uh just friends of mine that i've known for a little while who were you know also bartenders looking for something else to do and i said well this is what i'm doing and it's been pretty great so far and they're both like musicians so like artsy type guys so i just kind of like pitched them you know what i have found to be the most enjoyable parts about you know learning how to program and they just got really excited about it and actually the other one was from um pwj with somebody that reached out to me so i had i had two outbound and one inbound so i lied one of them was one of them reached out to me but the other two i got from from reaching out myself that's really smart like with how you're going i really believe that if you actually did 50 outreaches or less i think you can actually get a sale because i think you also have a good eye these numbers are for like literally if somebody was just trying to play the volume game and wasn't even focusing on the quality of messages right but if you're doing a good quality of messages i really believe that with about 50 outreaches you can generate a sale so i'm actually gonna do a different type of math for you so like let's say 50 outreaches leads to 400 then the question only becomes how long does it take you to do 50 outreaches right um i mean i'm i'm pretty you know i'm i'm not doing much nowadays because my jobs are still close so i'm pretty much home all day working on my computer or working on something so you know i mean it could maybe two days maybe three days to do 50 outreaches why would it take so many days to do 50 outreaches uh i suppose just to maybe do a little bit of research and maybe find people to reach out to oh i see yeah okay so let's say so you said how many has two days or three days yeah maybe two or three days okay and would it take eight hours a day uh it could do i mean especially you know if i'm trying to write you know you know i'm a writer too i want my writing to be good i wanted to be you know precisely i'll give you here i'll give you something very incredible for this um and this works really well for like for the starting of an outreach what works incredibly well is one sentence probably max two sentences but like one sentence which is just one or two lines and it's just complement and question so literally for example if i sent a long outreach oftentimes people don't reply because it comes off too salesy and not like regular conversational enough sure so the very simple combination that works extremely effectively is if you do an outreach and you're just like saw that you do this thing saw that you play the guitar or you play the piano and that's freaking amazing how's it going how are you holding up with coronavirus are you are you keeping safe question mark sure something as simple as that can be a thing that you can kind of copy paste of course you're gonna reach out to people you think are likely to actually pay for the service so that might take you some time to find them but yeah the outreach i would highly recommend to not over complicate because that's one area that can you can over engineer and actually the results get worse yeah it makes sense so if you were to do um almost a copy paste outreach but still like personalized to each person and if it was one sentence long how long would it take you to do 50 outreaches i mean probably not even a day then okay could we maybe yes how many hours would it take you i i do it within eight i reckon within eight hours within eight hours within eight hours if eight hours paid off to you making four hundred dollars would that be worth it absolutely okay yeah okay and that would put your hourly rate effectively at like 40 an hour yeah okay so eight hours let's just say for you equals one sale and as you start to do it more you build more momentum and also oftentimes there's a high chance that those other people you're having conversation with can also turn into a sale so it can it's very possible that your eight hours could result in two or three sales yeah it's also possible that the person that you sell to might book you again after two months yeah yeah yep it's also possible that if you got a few sales you could increase your price so then when you make a sale it's six hundred dollars yeah right okay so the only question is at this point is do you believe this is worth uh your time to do this for eight hours one of these days yeah absolutely hands down no question do you think there's a good day this week for you to try this strategy and see how it goes uh yeah yeah i mean i could uh make a nice day of it on sunday that's for sure that's dope um i don't know how you do this stuff but like for a day like this i would actually even love to just go and sit at a mall like just people watch and eat food somewhere and just read a book and do this the rest of the time yeah no that sounds that sounds lovely that's amazing so what do you so okay so you you're thinking about doing it potentially this sunday yeah potentially my uh my day is not set in stone yet so i figured uh i could potentially put it in there okay and what where would you like where would you be when you do it um i would probably be at home but there's also a park up the street from my apartment that's probably kind of a ghost town right now so i could go sit up there with some lunch and stuff like that and kind of make a nice little day outside out of it okay so if this is something that you want to get behind this is something that will actually help your life and you want to do can we actually on this call commit to you doing it this sunday and taking action on it yeah why not let's do it that's sick um okay and how if we're about to go about it can you reach out to me on either saturday or sunday that you're gonna go and execute on this and send me an instagram story tagging me yeah definitely yeah bro that's exciting hell yeah yeah it is and let's execute on this and the 50 outreaches whether you do them from wise and or take lessons or well any other platform the goal is just to get to 50 outreaches yeah dope okay i think that this is a phenomenal strategy and if this works i will just be so pumped i know that this works like guaranteed because i've done it even when i when i hear you you're like yo i did 10 to 20 outreaches and the result was three clients yeah you kind of already know that this is very possible um and if you need any help you can reach out to me but let's just make sure we do one thing which is let's use this momentum and the energy that we've spent and the fact that we're on this call to commit to doing it on sunday and then just reach out to me letting me know that you've done it on this sunday and then we can go from there sounds great man i appreciate all the guidance for sure amazing man i'm super super excited pumped to have you on brother anything else no just um you know i i appreciate everything you guys do man um like you know four months ago before i started doing this whole thing i was like man what the am i gonna do yeah and then i i found like a great like comfort and and uh you know avenue to still be creative and have a lot of fun doing it and so that's kind of my most favorite thing about programming is the creativity the art the creating and then the community too it's amazing it really is yeah yeah yeah bro i am so excited man i can't wait and i know that this is only gonna just make it even more practical and real for you and it gives you even more time to enjoy programming learning and just being more creative definitely yeah i look forward to it awesome brother thanks for being on this call and um you're reaching out to me this sunday yes definitely will do man i appreciate you thanks for having me all right brother take care bye all right you too see you dope that was awesome hopefully you guys also enjoyed it guys give it up that one great job patch that was an awesome call thanks for hopping on hopefully you guys also enjoyed it uh a lot going on there right there was a lot to unpack and go through hopefully maybe it gave you some insight into your world when it comes to freelancing or coding or improving your income the thought process that goes behind it but you can if you really break it down systematically and you get extremely precise about your language and precise about how it works then you just need to like follow these very clear simple steps and then you can actually get to the goal that you're trying to get to joseph says so 400 could turn into a twelve hundred dollar day exactly you know that's how i did 1200 cash uh yesterday no different than exactly what i was sharing with patch just blanked out completely but because i've worked on this process for a long period of time and i'm getting inbound leads i'm closing almost 100 to 75 right now which is really really crazy so it's like i got two sales calls and i closed two sales calls and that was twenty four hundred dollars cash and that was one hour of total my time so and revenue wise that was seventy two hundred for two for one hour of my time right so that when you start getting
