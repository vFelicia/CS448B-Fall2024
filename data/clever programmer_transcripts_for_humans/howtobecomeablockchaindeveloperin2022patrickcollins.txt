00:32 - oh solidity god that's my title i'm with
00:34 - it what's up quasi how are you man i'm
00:36 - here how are we doing
00:38 - let's go so i'm super excited to have
00:41 - patrick on today patrick if you don't
00:43 - know he just how i found him is he
00:45 - dropped this tutorial on youtube it hit
00:47 - 2 million views on free code camp
00:50 - yes sir and he's also a content creator
00:52 - he's a beast a super grounded guy as
00:55 - well and just really fun to talk to and
00:58 - uh today i pretty much want to talk with
01:00 - patrick about
01:01 - um web 3 crypto defy
01:05 - and um probably everything in between
01:08 - so patrick
01:08 - welcome on board brother hey kazia great
01:11 - to be here and and like we were chatting
01:13 - a little bit before we started filming
01:14 - but yeah your channel is fantastic i was
01:16 - telling them when we started filming i
01:18 - was like yo like when you go live you
01:19 - keep the energy up like that's what i'm
01:21 - about i'm about and yeah we uh we we had
01:23 - a what a zoom call maybe during like eat
01:25 - denver or something and it was so funny
01:28 - because uh there's there's a lot of
01:29 - people that i talked to very very
01:31 - serious very but like we just started
01:32 - ripping right away which was uh which
01:34 - was cool like yo what the [ __ ] okay
01:35 - how's it going yeah yeah you know we'll
01:36 - be [ __ ] crazy yeah we'll be crazy
01:39 - because even when i look at your channel
01:41 - it's fun to look at and most
01:43 - computers keep [ __ ] so boring
01:46 - um i mean not content creators let me
01:48 - not say content creators because they're
01:49 - going to come and shoot me
01:52 - yeah yeah
01:53 - but i think with a lot of developers i
01:55 - meet in the ecosystem they want to be
01:57 - like really professional and really
01:58 - serious yeah and um
02:02 - and i don't know like i'm just i'm very
02:04 - i'm very anti-corporate you know we're
02:06 - we're like the peter mckinnons of the
02:07 - coding world i feel like dude i have i
02:10 - have empirical evidence that this style
02:13 - of education this style of like
02:14 - edutainment almost is is better so when
02:17 - i was first making videos i got a ton of
02:19 - people dming me i'm saying yo dude you
02:22 - need to like stop all that silly [ __ ]
02:24 - like just just just just get on the
02:26 - screen like code and like shut the hell
02:28 - up and i was like i was like i know for
02:30 - a fact like when i'm learning i'm like
02:33 - if that [ __ ] is like i'm falling asleep
02:34 - if that's just if that's how it is so so
02:36 - what i ended up doing is i i released
02:38 - two videos back to back
02:40 - exact same content it was about like um
02:43 - asynchronous programming in python um
02:45 - didn't it blast them out didn't do
02:46 - anything the one one of them i'm like
02:49 - crazy zany like over the top and the
02:51 - other one i'm like shut the [ __ ] up like
02:53 - all right here this is
02:55 - 20 times 20 times the views on the more
02:58 - animated one it's a factor of 20. it's
03:00 - 20 times more impactful to like do the
03:03 - style of content that you do
03:05 - um and that's the empirical level so
03:06 - yeah dude
03:07 - same page the higher and it's more fun
03:10 - yeah i mean i agree it's like p
03:12 - people want to be entertained right why
03:14 - are they on youtube like
03:16 - they can just be reading like an
03:17 - encyclopedia
03:18 - book on the technology you know like
03:21 - right
03:21 - they're they're here because most people
03:23 - want to be entertained like joe attack
03:26 - who's one of the creators i really i
03:28 - really love um
03:29 - he's doing some really unique [ __ ] now
03:31 - and i actually bought two of his uh
03:34 - oh the nfts that he dropped yeah yeah
03:36 - yeah this is not a condoning of buying
03:39 - that [ __ ]
03:41 - not financial advice yeah yeah yeah
03:44 - yeah go ahead
03:45 - i was gonna say jomatech is uh he's he's
03:47 - super entertaining right superintendent
03:49 - he's a little bit different than what
03:51 - like you and i do like you're like more
03:52 - like yo here's how you code this stuff
03:54 - with that higher energy he's he's a lot
03:56 - more or he's a lot more like
03:58 - entertaining stuff although i think he
04:00 - has done he's done a lot in the past
04:03 - he has okay he was selling like his own
04:05 - courses around
04:07 - algorithms
04:08 - um and now he launches nft and uh
04:12 - his main purpose banned at nft so the
04:13 - community essentially it's like crowd
04:16 - funding for him so the community can
04:18 - fund him so he can like
04:20 - keep creating videos and content
04:22 - um
04:23 - but yeah i think i think that's that's
04:25 - what it is you know i think i think
04:27 - that's like a million dude in like 10
04:29 - minutes
04:30 - dude yeah he was like yeah we sold out
04:32 - right away which i i mean i'm pumped for
04:34 - him i think that that's fantastic right
04:35 - like i
04:36 - i think his style of content is really
04:38 - cool
04:39 - and um yeah however
04:41 - however he can monetize that great like
04:43 - that's
04:44 - a great use case for blockchain there
04:46 - you go right sliding right into the
04:47 - blockchain conversation that too
04:49 - yeah yeah yeah i mean it's pretty great
04:52 - i mean
04:54 - honestly though one thing i have been
04:56 - thinking about is i've been watching a
04:57 - lot of mr beast's [ __ ] dude content yeah
05:00 - i every single video he drops i watch
05:02 - are you serious okay so let me tell you
05:04 - dude i'm getting so [ __ ] excited like
05:06 - i'm actually thinking about dude i
05:07 - should be talking to you outside of this
05:09 - podcast dude
05:11 - [ __ ] brainstorming we need to be sinking
05:13 - because because i'm on the same like any
05:15 - time it's so like so uh so i work at
05:17 - chain like labs right and we have a
05:19 - bunch of da's right so we make we make
05:21 - content um we kind of change
05:23 - it it's a little bit different though
05:24 - but any single anytime someone's like yo
05:26 - what should i do for a video or for like
05:27 - presentation i always say like this is
05:29 - something mr b said once he was like
05:31 - don't
05:32 - give the audience time to ask
05:34 - am i bored right now
05:36 - yeah like don't let them don't let them
05:38 - be bored right because if they're bored
05:39 - that's when they that's when they bounce
05:41 - off and uh and like it it's it does a
05:43 - disservice to them like if you're
05:45 - being so boring that they leave like
05:48 - you're not getting them like especially
05:50 - for what we're doing we're not able to
05:51 - teach them as effectively dude so like
05:54 - every single every single mr beast video
05:56 - i'm like yo this is a this is a workshop
05:58 - on how to like make good content and i'm
06:00 - always trying we're on the same page
06:02 - although you've done a lot better than
06:03 - me i'm i'm always trying to tweak my
06:05 - [ __ ] to be more mr beastly but uh but
06:07 - basically yeah man so i think like
06:10 - mr b stuff uh so i'll tell you this i'm
06:12 - like actually studying at hardcore now
06:14 - like i'm okay studying it so what i mean
06:17 - by that is like his last video was like
06:20 - i built um
06:21 - uh
06:22 - it was um world's most dangerous escape
06:25 - room
06:26 - uh he he dropped one two days ago you're
06:27 - behind the scenes with sharks i don't
06:29 - know i watched that one too would you
06:30 - say okay okay
06:32 - i'm like
06:33 - i'm like that is genius i saw a title
06:36 - i'm like that's [ __ ] genius um
06:39 - and um
06:41 - yeah and then even like when i ran into
06:43 - him um and i asked him and he like
06:45 - looked at my phone and he told me my
06:46 - thumbnails were [ __ ] and i was like
06:51 - i was like all right keep working on it
06:53 - but like yeah his so the would you swim
06:55 - and then the world's most dangerous
06:57 - escape room so i started studying like
06:59 - the hook lasts from zero to seven
07:00 - seconds dude i oh like so the
07:05 - the the one um the one before he did the
07:07 - i'm getting chased by the military or
07:08 - something like that his hook was nine
07:10 - seconds and i was like oh my god he's
07:12 - making you shorter i literally same dude
07:14 - same page holy [ __ ] yep sorry keep going
07:17 - that's what i'm saying like
07:18 - [Laughter]
07:19 - like this year i'm really excited about
07:21 - working on some really big videos that
07:23 - get viral like they go viral in the tech
07:26 - space
07:27 - but people don't even need to understand
07:28 - it so like one of the ideas that i was
07:30 - having and i guess i'll just brainstorm
07:31 - some of it with you here because i was
07:33 - like
07:34 - one of the things i thought about is
07:36 - like turning it into a game show
07:38 - um like a game show for developers
07:40 - so no not many people like joe attack is
07:42 - doing the fictional side
07:45 - right like he's doing the side where
07:47 - um he has like these fictional videos or
07:50 - not fiction i don't know what the term
07:51 - is but it's like he's making up these
07:53 - short films and stories right i would
07:55 - want to do like um so i thought of the
07:58 - hook and my hook was like
08:00 - um
08:01 - i built the world's hardest javascript
08:03 - challenge and if this developer can
08:04 - solve it in one hour he wins ten
08:07 - thousand dollars oh
08:09 - wait that's super sick because when you
08:11 - s
08:12 - dude when you said game show i actually
08:14 - like a part of me was like like game
08:16 - show like there's somebody like hey
08:17 - welcome and they're like they're super
08:19 - boring
08:20 - but that but that hook right there
08:23 - that was sick
08:24 - that got me amp that got me excited oh
08:26 - that's sick that's that's me so i'm
08:28 - thinking about doing something like that
08:29 - where like we can get developers like so
08:32 - same
08:32 - on the next one
08:34 - you know what i'm saying so like
08:36 - hardest blockchain challenge and if this
08:39 - dude we have you fly in we have the
08:42 - challenges set up for you right and then
08:44 - once you do these 10 challenges yeah you
08:46 - win x prize but it's like they're
08:48 - obstacles in the way i don't know i just
08:51 - thought
08:52 - they got to like run laptop to laptop
08:54 - like solving like dude because that was
08:56 - the other thing i was like how do you
08:57 - make how do you make like the coding
08:58 - stuff entertaining like
09:00 - like so so we've done we've done um
09:02 - we've done speed coding for like chain
09:04 - link hackathons right where developer
09:06 - shows up they they like we we give them
09:08 - some random tasks and then whoever
09:10 - finishes it first wins those are
09:12 - exciting for me because i'm like you
09:13 - know i i see like all the different
09:15 - solidity techniques they're using and
09:16 - stuff and i'm like oh
09:17 - nice yeah but like but somebody who's
09:20 - maybe a little bit newer isn't going to
09:22 - really know what's or i i i like to
09:24 - think about like uh like league of
09:25 - legends for example if you don't play
09:27 - league of legends if you try to watch a
09:28 - league of legends it just looks like a
09:30 - cluster f
09:32 - bro it's it's so fun to watch even
09:34 - though i'm not i don't really really
09:36 - and i'm not good at all but i watched
09:38 - that [ __ ] bro
09:39 - i was on the twitch uh thing watching it
09:42 - yesterday i watched all the time i love
09:44 - chess i play competitive chess but like
09:48 - but it has nothing to do with league so
09:49 - i like sometimes watch chess streams but
09:51 - league i have no idea right and i'm
09:53 - watching league i went on twitch started
09:54 - watching league
09:56 - and it is so entertaining they'll be
09:58 - like oh my god oh my god he's patrick's
09:59 - in the middle lane and he's about to
10:00 - gank him and the dragon calls over all
10:02 - like oh [ __ ] look it's so i get hyped
10:05 - and i kind of get what's happening so i
10:07 - feel like league of legends gets a lot
10:09 - of viewership but i'll tell you why i
10:11 - think even if people don't really know
10:12 - it they can still watch it because they
10:15 - get people get killing they're like two
10:17 - people
10:18 - right right right they get money people
10:20 - are getting coins yep um people get the
10:23 - concept of like one person outsmarting
10:25 - the other so when you involve commentary
10:27 - i think the energy of the commentary
10:29 - makes it exciting but if you didn't have
10:31 - the commentary you'd be like what the
10:32 - hell am i watching yeah yeah oh that's
10:33 - so interesting because so i i played i
10:36 - have played way too much league of
10:37 - legends so when i watched league of
10:38 - legends the whole time i'm like oh [ __ ]
10:39 - like oh my god like i don't i don't need
10:41 - the commentary because i like see what's
10:42 - going on i mean i do appreciate the
10:44 - commentary but that's crazy i i never
10:46 - thought that people like who didn't know
10:48 - the game because like
10:49 - dude i i played a a way too much league
10:52 - i i've quit i i only play for one week i
10:56 - was gonna say this
10:57 - i don't really play league but some
10:59 - people from our team play league like
11:01 - programmer and so like tonight
11:03 - i told them guys let's link up and let's
11:05 - play
11:06 - oh my god
11:08 - no dude i i quit dude i was uh i i was
11:11 - bad that's like all i would do i would
11:14 - like i would finish work i would play
11:15 - league so i i've i've been quit i've
11:17 - been sober for quite some time um
11:21 - but but
11:22 - one week out of the year i'll play like
11:24 - i'll wake up
11:25 - gambler when you like play league dude
11:27 - turn into an awful human being
11:30 - i don't
11:31 - uh in the beginning i was an awful human
11:33 - being i'm a lot uh i like to think i'm a
11:35 - pretty nice player now even when people
11:37 - are being toxic but
11:39 - naughty no like there's um i one week
11:42 - out of the year i play i wake up at 8
11:44 - a.m i go to bed at 8 a.m the next day i
11:47 - sleep for 16 hours and like when i'm
11:49 - awake all i'm doing is playing playing
11:51 - league and that's like that's like a
11:52 - vacation for me and then my girlfriend
11:55 - my girlfriend like looks at me sideways
11:57 - and goes really like this is what you
11:58 - want to do and i'm like yes yes yes
12:02 - dude i i come from like a gaming
12:04 - background so i i
12:05 - oh really yeah like so i used to do
12:07 - competitive gaming ever since i was like
12:09 - 11 or 12 years old like even younger
12:10 - than that i played rts games like
12:12 - command and conquer general zero hour
12:14 - warcraft frozen throne uh what years of
12:18 - war i was ranked number three in the
12:19 - world for a whole month what what
12:21 - mirror's edge i was ranked number one
12:23 - holy [ __ ]
12:24 - um oh yeah i played games like all the
12:27 - [ __ ] time dude it was like i was
12:29 - playing
12:30 - 17 hours a day 18 hours a day when i was
12:32 - younger
12:33 - apparently sleeping my best best best
12:36 - summer ever was me and my best friend he
12:39 - would just come over all the time and we
12:41 - would play borderlands just grind berlin
12:43 - really yeah so you're kind of like the
12:45 - same thing that i did except for you're
12:47 - doing a lot better you took all that
12:49 - that energy that like oh yo i'm gonna
12:51 - play until like i can't like keep my
12:53 - eyes open anymore and then just put it
12:55 - into like youtube and coding and all
12:56 - that stuff that's yeah that's what i did
12:58 - coding became like the thing coding like
13:01 - literally felt like it was a video game
13:02 - and then people paid me and i was like
13:03 - this is [ __ ] stupid like don't be
13:05 - painful
13:09 - dude i feel that that's how that's how
13:11 - it feels my brother just started coding
13:13 - he's like uh he has like an
13:15 - exercise science background and he just
13:18 - started coding he was like yo this is
13:19 - like low-key kind of fun and i was like
13:21 - that's what i'm saying
13:23 - just like getting over that like hump to
13:25 - like figure it out and then you have
13:26 - like all this creativity and you do all
13:28 - this crazy crazy [ __ ] and then you can
13:30 - do yeah
13:31 - weird tutorials like what like i'm gonna
13:33 - create uber on the blockchain or or
13:35 - whatever your last video was yeah dude
13:37 - like
13:38 - agreed
13:39 - same page same exact page yeah now we're
13:42 - now we're definitely doing now where
13:43 - it's like okay let's start building
13:45 - crazy [ __ ] that people like yeah um but
13:48 - but definitely the side that i want to
13:49 - explore so i'm like kind of giving
13:50 - myself a goal and this is a crazy goal
13:53 - like there's probably three percent
13:55 - chance of me succeeding in it but the
13:56 - goal is so it took us five years to get
13:59 - to one million subs but this year my
14:01 - goal is to get to 2 million subs
14:05 - you're uh you're preaching that goal out
14:06 - in public huh yeah okay
14:10 - only nine months left
14:11 - um so there's not much time left and so
14:14 - basically i have to be hitting like 100
14:16 - 000 subs per month
14:18 - or more you're at 1.1 right now though
14:20 - oh and you started doing more shorts too
14:23 - yeah i did mix it in i'm with it a
14:25 - little i did the garyvee one people
14:27 - liked it
14:28 - oh [ __ ] you got garyvee in here too i
14:30 - got no no fake i i i did a garyvee pair
14:33 - oh oh
14:36 - yeah
14:37 - tick tock
14:38 - yeah yeah i was like
14:41 - my apple is slow as [ __ ] i want my users
14:44 - to be patient
14:47 - oh man oh i love garyvee oh that's too
14:49 - funny
14:51 - like people i got tons of positive
14:52 - feedback on that so like
14:54 - i'm like trying to so what i'm trying to
14:56 - do is uh i'm gonna start doing lots of
14:59 - shorts and reels just because it it's
15:01 - very quick to produce something yeah
15:02 - yeah yeah i'm getting lots of positive
15:04 - feedback then i think i'm gonna turn it
15:06 - into longer form that's like imagine a
15:08 - youtube
15:10 - just like if gary v uh tried coding for
15:13 - one day
15:15 - and it's just a parody you know
15:17 - right but like then the question that
15:19 - becomes does that style does that if you
15:21 - like using the shorter ones it's like a
15:23 - signal it's like an indicator right
15:25 - maybe that style of content only works
15:27 - for the shorts
15:29 - yeah it's possible but like there's a
15:30 - captain sinbad who did like uh watches
15:34 - grant cardone once or watches garyvee
15:36 - once and then he like turns into grant
15:38 - cardone or whatever and that's like
15:40 - almost 2 million views
15:43 - yeah joe attacks because like what i
15:45 - realize is stuff with parodies and
15:47 - things that are funny or interesting
15:49 - really entertaining
15:51 - people watch it and so it has high watch
15:52 - time and then youtube just keeps
15:54 - recommending the [ __ ] out of it like
15:56 - crazy
15:57 - you know like mr b says shoot for on
16:00 - your okay let me ask you this on your
16:01 - youtube
16:02 - do you know what's your average
16:03 - retention like average percentage
16:06 - watched on like some of your recent
16:08 - videos uh i haven't been uh i'm i
16:10 - haven't been grinding the youtube stats
16:12 - that's nearly as much as you all have
16:15 - yeah
16:16 - i have no idea
16:17 - no idea i'll tell you
16:19 - with tutorials and [ __ ] it's like 10 or
16:21 - lower is what i've realized
16:23 - um it's pretty low uh my long tutorials
16:26 - are one percent two percent
16:28 - um
16:29 - and some of my best my best videos like
16:32 - with two million views are 35 percent
16:34 - watched
16:35 - yeah like top five programming languages
16:38 - to learn in 2021 or whatever or 2020
16:40 - that got like 2 million views
16:42 - 38 watched uh mr beast he's like
16:47 - uh he his he says
16:49 - he tries to never drop anything that
16:52 - will hit below 70 retention
16:54 - what
16:55 - and we're we're hitting like between i'm
16:58 - probably hitting between one and ten
16:59 - you're hitting between 10 and 35. it's
17:01 - [ __ ] crazy dude that's that's that
17:04 - sounds like mr beast so the hard thing
17:06 - that i i have like trying to figure out
17:08 - though is because most of the stuff that
17:09 - i'm trying to do i'm trying to like
17:12 - okay and then maybe this
17:13 - yeah like because because my my whole
17:16 - thing like everything that i'm like
17:17 - doing in my life right now is like all
17:19 - right how do i get how do i figure out
17:20 - how to like share this amazing
17:22 - technology and like get coders as
17:24 - excited as me
17:25 - uh and like and like teach it right
17:26 - because there's so
17:28 - like few
17:29 - good really solid like people who like
17:32 - really understand solidity really
17:33 - understand smart contracts and so i'm
17:35 - like i'm like always feeling like okay i
17:36 - gotta like i gotta i gotta show them how
17:38 - to do this new code thing but like maybe
17:40 - the strat is what you're saying like
17:43 - mix in more like which i have been um
17:46 - but it's like it's not my focus as much
17:49 - i don't know what are your thoughts
17:50 - there
17:51 - i i'm torn i'm i'm in i've been torn for
17:54 - the last half a decade five years i've
17:56 - been doing this and i've been like do i
17:57 - go more entertainment and like
18:00 - mass and viral do i focus more on like
18:02 - niching down and staying focused on this
18:04 - and i'm like if i don't teach this then
18:06 - who am i like weird [ __ ] like that but
18:08 - then i was like thinking about it and
18:10 - i'm like it's like a youtube existential
18:12 - crisis almost yeah yeah yeah who am i
18:15 - yeah who am i
18:16 - [Laughter]
18:17 - i'm nobody
18:20 - i thought about it i'm like okay
18:22 - yeah that's true that if i don't do this
18:25 - you know it changes kind of my niche and
18:27 - it can be scary for the youtube
18:28 - algorithm things like that but then i
18:29 - thought about like what's my goal my
18:31 - goal is to get
18:33 - as many people into the world of coding
18:35 - as possible like whether it's web 3 or
18:37 - web 2 i don't care like as long as
18:39 - people can get into coding and so i feel
18:42 - like
18:43 - if if i have videos that get
18:46 - massive like millions of viewers
18:49 - entered that's like yeah thinking like
18:51 - you're okay let me tell it to you like
18:52 - this when you were young and you had you
18:54 - had that like cool [ __ ] professor
18:57 - just because a professor was cool and
18:59 - you [ __ ] with a professor you wanted
19:00 - to become what whatever he or she did
19:04 - yeah you make a good point yeah um
19:06 - rappers move entire industries and like
19:09 - create new genres just because like
19:11 - they are like what they're dropping lots
19:13 - of people [ __ ] with it and then they
19:15 - want to like
19:16 - be what they are or follow their path or
19:18 - their journey and so i'm like
19:21 - if i go mass appeal
19:23 - people will still come and watch my
19:24 - tutorials
19:28 - i think that makes a lot of sense
19:31 - bro i need more time in the day [ __ ] me
19:35 - um plus it's just interesting like
19:37 - creatively challenging like it's uh more
19:39 - than yeah yeah yeah
19:40 - above anything it's just like when i
19:42 - look at your content and you're doing
19:44 - you're pushing yourself creatively more
19:46 - than anything for me it's just like a
19:47 - really interesting creative challenge
19:50 - that's a really interesting way to look
19:51 - at it like how do i oh that's really
19:53 - interesting right could the how do i how
19:56 - do i get people excited about this thing
19:59 - um
20:00 - while also making sure to deliver like
20:01 - the impactful content and then how
20:04 - creative can i be
20:05 - to hit both of those goals
20:08 - yeah um
20:09 - yeah dude no that makes a lot of sense
20:11 - yeah so yeah i mean those were just a
20:14 - couple of things that i thought about
20:17 - um
20:18 - but yeah other than that i think overall
20:21 - our focus is
20:22 - how
20:23 - you know let's let's teach people about
20:25 - blockchain let's teach people about yeah
20:28 - um crypto more let's teach people about
20:30 - web three more so that's what we've been
20:31 - focusing on now which is which is
20:33 - phenomenal right the more people who can
20:35 - understand this technology the better um
20:38 - we are
20:40 - like people keep saying like we're early
20:43 - but like the thing is i feel like they
20:44 - don't really realize like how early we
20:47 - are like
20:49 - like because if you if you think about
20:50 - it like they're still like what what is
20:52 - the market cap of like hedge funds like
20:54 - several
20:55 - 100 trillion dollars right like
20:59 - or or something like that
21:01 - we could probably google it it's like
21:02 - it's some insane number right encrypt
21:04 - all of crypto combined is like what like
21:06 - 2 trillion or something like that
21:08 - like
21:09 - we're this tiny fragment of like
21:13 - like this whole old centralized way of
21:16 - doing things and we there's just like so
21:18 - so so like any and what i'm trying to
21:20 - say is see what you're saying thank you
21:21 - for your blockchain work and uh excited
21:23 - to keep bringing people in because yeah
21:25 - like we have this this um
21:26 - this issue of like okay like do we trust
21:29 - all these institutions that have like
21:30 - just continued to [ __ ] people in the
21:31 - past
21:32 - yeah i mean we can but we have a
21:35 - technology that makes it so we don't
21:36 - have to so why don't we just use that
21:40 - like one of the things that i thought
21:41 - about and and tell me kind of where your
21:43 - thoughts are on this but i think i spoke
21:45 - about this a little bit over the phone
21:47 - but we can go more on this so like
21:49 - one of the times you know people there
21:51 - are a lot of hot buzzwords in the
21:53 - blockchain we're like decentralized and
21:55 - a bunch of other things which if you
21:56 - don't really know what it means it just
21:57 - sounds like buzzwords but kind of one of
21:59 - the times it hit me
22:01 - is um
22:03 - when i saw kind of what was happening in
22:05 - russia recently where the ruble was
22:08 - dropping like crazy and these people
22:10 - were going and they're like yo the ruble
22:12 - values dropping like crazy we need to go
22:14 - and exchange this for something else and
22:17 - when they went to exchange it
22:19 - like they had just blocked off the
22:21 - exchanges
22:23 - basically just told them like no you
22:24 - can't exchange it and so basically i
22:26 - kind of realized like oh [ __ ] that's the
22:28 - dangerous part about having centralized
22:30 - exchanges and centralized control
22:33 - whereas if they had their money in
22:34 - crypto like let's just say it was like
22:36 - crypto rubles you know the usdc
22:39 - equivalent of rubles
22:41 - um
22:42 - they could just like liquidate and go
22:44 - into any other token or any other thing
22:46 - and do that instantly and nobody could
22:48 - stop them in the world
22:50 - yeah it's it's like one of these
22:52 - just crazy superpowers that crypto gives
22:54 - us right it's this thing where it says
22:56 - hey like
22:58 - there are people who want to screw you
23:00 - over and um it's it's it's so tricky
23:04 - because right like
23:05 - the winners write history right so like
23:07 - who is right is usually by you know but
23:10 - there's a good chance that you know
23:11 - there have the the people who should
23:13 - have won were on the losing side and
23:15 - they got screwed over and uh
23:17 - technology like this would have would
23:19 - have saved that so
23:20 - but yeah no you're spot on man like uh
23:24 - decentralized exchanges i feel like are
23:26 - one of these things that like we've
23:27 - solved and it's it's crazy to me like
23:30 - that um
23:32 - that
23:33 - well it's not craziness there's this
23:35 - learning gap that we need to get over
23:37 - but it's crazy to me that we're not all
23:38 - like holy [ __ ] how do we
23:40 - get this like faster and i know there's
23:42 - a ton of people excited about it and i
23:43 - know there's a ton of incumbents who are
23:46 - less excited about it but um
23:48 - yeah now we're now we're like you you're
23:50 - going to get me ranting here quasi if
23:52 - you don't cut me off it's perfect it's
23:53 - it's great i i do i think ranting on
23:55 - this is great because it's something
23:57 - important for people to hear right so
23:58 - like for example
24:00 - um something else that i've been super
24:02 - excited about is recently i started
24:03 - working with like web 3 companies and
24:05 - they have been paying in
24:08 - like crypto and uh
24:10 - and
24:12 - it's like three minutes
24:14 - or two minutes and you you get paid and
24:16 - i'm like what is this this is so weird
24:18 - this is so crazy and so it kind of hit
24:21 - me i'm like
24:22 - it's like now the money is not this like
24:25 - traditional ancient bank money where
24:27 - like your money's sleeping on a saturday
24:29 - and a sunday like what the [ __ ] like
24:32 - how does that make any sense first of
24:34 - all like if money is the most important
24:36 - thing just have somebody on the saturday
24:38 - and sunday shift so they're running the
24:40 - money stuff like
24:42 - i don't get it right but then like with
24:44 - crypto you could send it 24 7. you get
24:46 - everybody gets within a couple of
24:47 - minutes which is huge um
24:51 - some examples even some of my own team
24:52 - members are like
24:54 - when they get paid because if sometimes
24:56 - if it takes five days or seven days for
24:58 - them to get paid
24:59 - they have to they pay their they end up
25:01 - paying their rent late which means they
25:03 - start getting all these fees but if my
25:06 - team was getting paid in crypto they
25:08 - would get their money right away right
25:10 - and there's no stopping it but one fear
25:12 - i will tell you is love
25:14 - it was [ __ ] weird for me to get paid
25:17 - encrypted dude i was like scared i was
25:18 - like
25:19 - they're gonna be just paying me in this
25:21 - like metamask wallet that i have
25:24 - and it's like it's just a it's a chrome
25:26 - [ __ ] extension that i'm depending my
25:28 - whole life on
25:29 - you know what i mean and i'm like yeah
25:31 - it's so shaky and flaky and it could
25:33 - just die
25:34 - what if i forget the mnemonic password
25:36 - like how would i log into my phone to
25:38 - get this money um
25:40 - you know and then i had to learn about
25:41 - non-custodial wallets and they're like
25:43 - it's if it's a non-custodial wallet no
25:45 - wait wait wait let me let me jump in
25:46 - there like [ __ ] that like
25:48 - take that term out of your dictionary
25:51 - okay that is that is some marketing
25:52 - [ __ ] to like say like oh like
25:55 - non-custodial wallets are like worse or
25:58 - like no there's there's it's not
26:00 - non-custodial wallets it's just your
26:01 - [ __ ] wallets you got the private key
26:03 - it's your it's your token right like
26:05 - because what are they saying like
26:06 - custodial wallets are like [ __ ] that's
26:07 - kyc'd [ __ ] that like that is some
26:10 - marketing [ __ ] uh don't let don't don't
26:13 - uh this this is my like this is me
26:14 - speaking from within now don't [ __ ]
26:16 - say that [ __ ] anymore not custodial
26:18 - wallets that it's it's like
26:20 - the the reason the reason that the
26:22 - reason i think that that terminology
26:24 - came about was there was this huge push
26:26 - you know from governments they wanted
26:27 - kyc all that [ __ ] so they started saying
26:29 - like non-custodial wallets as if like
26:31 - that's the worst one is if custodial is
26:33 - like the norm
26:34 - so which is which is a bunch of [ __ ]
26:36 - totally antithesis of what blockchain is
26:38 - yeah um but yeah and and then there's
26:40 - stuff like that happen so this is the
26:42 - perfect there's stuff like that
26:43 - happening where it's like oh like i
26:44 - gotta learn about non-custodial versus
26:46 - custodial like [ __ ] that [ __ ] like but
26:49 - but agree there's there's a lot of like
26:50 - user experience stuff that needs to
26:53 - improve right like the fact that you're
26:54 - like if i forget my private key i'm
26:56 - screwed yeah i do think there are a lot
26:58 - of people where like a service like some
27:01 - type of managed service even though
27:02 - again that's the antithesis of
27:03 - blockchain might be helpful for um yeah
27:06 - i think i think multi-sigs are a good
27:08 - approach there because
27:09 - uh if you forget and you have like
27:12 - two really close people to you who are
27:14 - on the multi-sig
27:15 - then great like it's okay um but yeah i
27:18 - agree there's definitely still like a
27:20 - curve
27:21 - um to make it easier for the masses
27:25 - what i could do is like i could
27:27 - have two of my brothers put in their
27:29 - passwords
27:31 - right and then like if i ever need to
27:32 - access it worst case scenario and
27:34 - everything both of my brothers can
27:36 - put it in and yeah or like or like a
27:38 - recovery wallet basically yeah you say
27:40 - hey like i i can do keys these are like
27:43 - the cool thing about smart contracts is
27:44 - you can code it to do
27:46 - whatever you want to do so um yeah you
27:48 - can do stuff like that but but agreed
27:50 - it's like there is this like um
27:54 - kind of like you know even i've done it
27:56 - a ton now sometimes when i send crypto
27:57 - i'm still like okay like
27:59 - hopefully i sent it to the right address
28:01 - yeah that's what i did
28:02 - like that that whole thing would like
28:04 - hopefully send it to the right address
28:06 - like i really wish that better solutions
28:09 - around that because that's like a really
28:10 - weird one it's like
28:13 - because currently with the way that i
28:15 - send money like
28:16 - going into the web 2 world i feel really
28:18 - secure i know 99 of the times like
28:21 - you know
28:22 - uh
28:23 - when i'm sending it it's gonna get sent
28:25 - there when i pop in my brother like
28:27 - let's say if it's paypal
28:28 - um i'm sending it to his email address
28:30 - it auto completes his email address his
28:32 - photo shows up like i'm sure it's the
28:35 - same dude well so the thing is like
28:38 - stuff like that like
28:39 - can be built and it's like yeah i mean
28:42 - like one of the uh the steps in that
28:44 - direction is we have e s now ethereum
28:46 - name service and like if i'm if i want
28:48 - someone to send me eth i say hey like
28:50 - patrick alpha c dot eth
28:52 - right and so boom you can just send it
28:54 - to like my domain almost which i think
28:56 - is like it's a much easier
28:59 - like much more friendly approach uh to
29:01 - sending stuff so i i think we're getting
29:03 - there yeah um but we'll we'll need more
29:05 - and again like the crazy thing is like
29:07 - what ethereum came out in 2015
29:11 - 2014 2016 one of those days
29:15 - and yeah in the grand scheme of things
29:17 - it's like this is new this is really
29:19 - yeah i mean bitcoin was um
29:21 - wow i'm forgetting on my dates now 2009
29:24 - something yeah i think so 2011 to the
29:26 - 2009
29:27 - was bitcoin
29:31 - 2009. okay all right i got it all right
29:33 - we're we're good
29:34 - um yeah created let's see
29:37 - 2015
29:40 - i think they announced 2014 or something
29:42 - but i mean dates or whatever um uh-huh
29:46 - but yeah we're getting there we're
29:47 - getting the kazi there there's a lot of
29:48 - stuff to do and uh and that's why
29:52 - i'm so early we're early and i'm so on
29:55 - the [ __ ] train of like teaching
29:57 - people how to build this crazy [ __ ]
29:58 - because yeah like we can move towards
30:00 - this world where you can kind of like
30:01 - do [ __ ] you can like just have access to
30:04 - the markets to me that's like
30:07 - like wherever you are it doesn't matter
30:08 - like you can
30:09 - you can be a part of like financing be
30:12 - like an accredited investor to invest oh
30:14 - my god dude yeah like right
30:16 - yep you have to be yeah it just means
30:19 - like we're gonna allow rich people to
30:20 - get richer most of the time
30:23 - yep when a company is ipo'ing or
30:26 - whatever yeah they they get to get in at
30:28 - the best pricing
30:30 - the credit investor is like all right if
30:32 - you're already filthy rich and you want
30:33 - to get
30:34 - richer if you're filthy rich get in for
30:37 - cheaper and if you don't have money you
30:39 - have to pay 50 times that [ __ ]
30:42 - it's i i understand what the idea is
30:45 - it's like oh well if you if you're not a
30:47 - credit
30:48 - investor maybe you're this is gonna
30:51 - sound crazy maybe you're you don't have
30:52 - the experience uh that's a better way of
30:54 - saying it maybe you don't have the
30:55 - experience to do that but to me like
30:57 - pardon me is like it's like oh like
30:58 - they're they're thinking i'm too [ __ ]
30:59 - stupid to like to invest in this thing
31:02 - come on like it's like let me yeah
31:05 - like the government shouldn't i feel
31:06 - like a government shouldn't be allowed
31:08 - to make that decision for you like they
31:09 - allow gambling you know whatever dude
31:12 - allow all
31:13 - this [ __ ] like how are you deciding this
31:15 - is the thing that like i don't get to
31:17 - invest into a company but i can go and
31:19 - gamble yes dude i i think about this all
31:22 - the time because i'm like yo like so i
31:24 - worked at a hedge fund for a couple
31:25 - years and i was like
31:27 - what's yeah dude i worked at hedge fund
31:28 - for a couple years
31:30 - crazy
31:31 - excuse me an asset manager asset manager
31:34 - okay but like this is the same thing
31:36 - because yeah you i feel like you know so
31:38 - much about like crypto or like just the
31:41 - money stuff
31:42 - yeah yeah well it was crazy because i
31:44 - like uh i joined the the company because
31:46 - i wanted to learn it you know more about
31:48 - coding i was new in my career
31:50 - and i was fascinated about like how big
31:52 - money works and i was like well i want
31:54 - to learn how that how how does the world
31:56 - work basically in like another in
31:58 - another sense and then i'm like all
32:00 - right what's the secret sauce
32:02 - and like
32:04 - you know
32:05 - it the my takeaway from like and i read
32:08 - a ton of books and like i worked here
32:09 - and i talked to all these people who
32:10 - worked at like different groups my
32:12 - takeaway was that
32:14 - they're basically like
32:16 - running a ton a ton of software to guess
32:19 - what is going to go up and guess what is
32:22 - going to go down
32:24 - and that's it and i'm like that's the
32:27 - same thing if i go to [ __ ] casino and
32:30 - i go
32:32 - roll a roulette ball and i'm guessing
32:34 - it's going to be black or white and like
32:35 - i'm like it's it's like gambling with
32:37 - like way more steps and now that isn't
32:40 - totally fair that isn't totally fair um
32:43 - it's definitely not totally fair and
32:45 - um i think there are a lot of financial
32:47 - institutions that do do right and that
32:49 - do do good things so i i don't wanna i
32:51 - wanna just
32:52 - do
32:56 - i knew this was a good good uh good call
32:58 - to get on
32:59 - room temperature iq's over here
33:04 - excellent dude i'm back i'm back in
33:06 - fifth grade this is great
33:07 - um talking about like big money hedge
33:09 - funds and [ __ ] um
33:12 - but uh but yeah so so some of them like
33:15 - do
33:16 - do
33:19 - what [ __ ]
33:20 - um
33:21 - they do they do like uh actually like
33:23 - help the investors and and and help them
33:25 - like get into
33:26 - uh places to save their money to save
33:28 - their value right because in my mind
33:29 - that's what investing is it's like save
33:31 - your value
33:32 - um but there's there's a lot of them
33:35 - that what their goal is is it's you know
33:37 - it's a zero-sum game if you're winning
33:38 - somebody else is losing figure out any
33:41 - little way to like screw somebody else
33:43 - over and it's it's just guessing right
33:45 - and it's yeah
33:47 - that's one thing that's that's really
33:48 - frustrating is that there's um there's
33:50 - yeah like you said there's a lot of
33:51 - people who are allowed to play this
33:53 - guessing game to play this gambling game
33:54 - and there's a lot of people that aren't
33:56 - and it's it's it's really frustrating so
33:57 - but but i again i want to make it
33:59 - perfectly clear that i'm not [ __ ] on
34:02 - the entire uh financial industry
34:05 - but i am [ __ ] on some of them to be
34:07 - to be quite frank because yeah it's it's
34:09 - um a ton of them they're just like
34:11 - they're they're get they get paid a [ __ ]
34:13 - ton of money to guess
34:15 - with a ton with a ton of charts and [ __ ]
34:18 - and they're just guessing i feel like i
34:20 - mean another thing as you were talking i
34:22 - started thinking about and i'm like what
34:24 - another thing that web 3 and this
34:26 - blockchain world is allowing us to do is
34:29 - um
34:30 - you know first of all you don't need you
34:32 - know so just in layman's terms if we
34:34 - could just bring it down so yeah what
34:36 - this basically means is
34:39 - let's say a company like
34:41 - tesla
34:44 - if it was in the traditional world you
34:46 - can't you weren't as a normal person you
34:49 - the viewers watching it who's probably
34:51 - not an accredited investor if you are
34:53 - that's [ __ ] great but like if you're
34:55 - not
34:55 - um
34:56 - probably what happened is when when
34:58 - tesla like you know was private company
35:01 - or whatever you couldn't invest in it
35:03 - but
35:04 - the co-founder of
35:05 - like
35:06 - twit uh or not twitch but like companies
35:09 - like twitter or whatever probably could
35:11 - yeah don't don't [ __ ] on him like that
35:13 - you just had him on your uh he's a great
35:15 - he's a great dude
35:17 - like he's getting i don't know he's
35:18 - companies because he's rich as [ __ ] and
35:20 - i'm not yeah
35:23 - but like but yeah it's uh yeah just like
35:26 - they could all get in early but like you
35:29 - can't get in early but if it was in the
35:31 - web 3 or blockchain world it's very
35:33 - likely that if like tesla launched they
35:35 - would have a tesla token that goes
35:37 - alongside it and from day one
35:40 - you could have been like an investor if
35:42 - you believed in it yeah no quasi to me
35:45 - the the biggest thing here like like
35:47 - because even in crypto like those
35:49 - guessing
35:50 - excuse me those guessing games are going
35:51 - to happen those groups that are just
35:53 - playing you know which which is fine
35:54 - because again i think there are a lot of
35:56 - them that do um do well do do right by
35:59 - investors they're really trying to get a
36:01 - return and like save people's value and
36:03 - i and i do think a lot of these
36:04 - financial products are really important
36:06 - yeah however to me the bigger thing the
36:09 - crazy thing is
36:11 - um information asymmetry and to me that
36:14 - is like one of these things that
36:15 - blockchain really just like nails in
36:17 - like elaine what do you mean by that
36:19 - yeah yeah so um
36:21 - so have you heard of flash boys before
36:24 - nope
36:25 - okay cool so
36:26 - back in
36:28 - the early 2000s right there was kind of
36:30 - the
36:30 - or maybe late 90s i forget the actual
36:33 - date but uh there were a lot of these
36:35 - high frequency trading firms popping up
36:37 - right and um they made a movie about
36:39 - this i think it's called like butterfly
36:41 - or something like that um where
36:43 - basically they like uh what was
36:45 - happening was
36:46 - whoever's server was closer to
36:49 - like the nasdaq or like the different
36:51 - exchanges could like send trades quicker
36:54 - and screw other people over so they
36:56 - would like see somebody somebody's about
36:57 - to make a trade right and basically
36:59 - front run them right so okay you're
37:01 - about to buy a bunch of bunch of this
37:03 - thing okay i'm gonna buy it first sell
37:04 - it back to you
37:06 - um and just like all this this kind of
37:09 - again because it's a zero-sum game
37:11 - everyone's looking for like the edge the
37:13 - thing to like [ __ ] over the other person
37:15 - and um what it ended up doing was it
37:18 - just like everyone's getting wrecked by
37:19 - these people who are just have this new
37:21 - technology because they have this
37:22 - information they serve industry they're
37:24 - closer to the to the servers they have
37:26 - uh
37:27 - they're faster whatever and it kind of
37:29 - it it doesn't really make for like a
37:31 - fair market like how is it fair that
37:33 - because your computer is like a foot
37:36 - closer to where they run the
37:37 - transactions that you're getting better
37:39 - deals like that's not fair at all that's
37:41 - ridiculous right yeah um and there's
37:43 - there's stuff like this that happens all
37:44 - the time and um
37:47 - and even more so
37:48 - uh like when people make deals or when
37:50 - people
37:52 - i would okay so i will
37:54 - i would kind of play the devil's
37:55 - advocate and also go please yeah yeah go
37:57 - for it i would also go
37:59 - nothing is fair like that's how people
38:01 - find their edge in business and things
38:03 - because they find the unfair thing or
38:05 - whatever that gives them that edge not
38:07 - an unethical way but maybe that's so
38:10 - it's like why don't you just find a way
38:12 - to get closer to the data center maybe
38:13 - that's the thing to thought about you
38:14 - know that maybe a lot of people didn't
38:15 - think about but we keep going i'm
38:17 - listening no it's that that's a great
38:19 - point i mean uh the counter argument
38:21 - then it's like okay well not everybody
38:22 - can be closest there can only be one
38:24 - closest
38:25 - um but that's true but then the but then
38:27 - the other thing to think about is okay
38:28 - well imagine this imagine two systems
38:32 - one where there's a one in one million
38:35 - chance of you being the closest one to
38:37 - the server versus a system where there's
38:40 - perfect information and everyone can see
38:42 - everything
38:44 - that's true which which one are you
38:45 - gonna pick well there's a one in one
38:47 - million chance of you like being in the
38:49 - close of one so why the [ __ ] would you
38:51 - not pick this one in this one's
38:52 - blockchain yeah um so so there's uh
38:55 - although like there there is still front
38:57 - running and all this crazy an mev and
38:59 - all the [ __ ] that happened to blockchain
39:00 - but the thing i like is that all the
39:01 - information is perfect right there's you
39:03 - you know immediately who screwed you you
39:06 - know what's going on and it's much
39:08 - easier to say okay cool well i'm just
39:10 - gonna do what you just did right versus
39:13 - like in in the traditional world that
39:14 - everything happens behind closed doors
39:16 - or like if a company is going to do
39:19 - um some crazy thing or they're they're
39:21 - they're leeching money or they're you
39:23 - know the protocol is you know they're
39:25 - going bankrupt or something
39:26 - everything all of that is available on
39:29 - chain there's no like there's no like oh
39:32 - like this person knows like
39:34 - how much money the protocol has made you
39:36 - can see on chain how much money the
39:38 - protocol or excuse me the company right
39:39 - you can see all this information and i
39:41 - think that that's crazy the transparency
39:44 - is crazy crazy it's dude it's like it's
39:47 - crazy powerful and then additionally
39:50 - the biggest thing the thing that i
39:51 - usually rants about is this uh this
39:52 - trust minimization there's just fewer
39:54 - entities you have to trust because the
39:56 - code just
39:57 - does its thing right you say hey like
39:59 - jump it it jumps right it uh you say hey
40:01 - like send money it sends money there's
40:03 - no
40:04 - where does trust minimization come into
40:06 - play
40:07 - yeah so uh all over the place um uh one
40:10 - of my favorite examples that i give
40:12 - because it's like it's pretty easy for
40:14 - people to understand it uh have you
40:15 - heard of the mcmillion scandal
40:18 - uh this is the mcdonald's one that i
40:20 - think you've told me about right yes oh
40:22 - did i tell you about this yeah yeah yeah
40:24 - so i'll add it on here okay yeah so
40:26 - mcdonald's they ran this promotion where
40:27 - they were basically like yo
40:29 - buyer mcnuggets and
40:31 - we'll you know play our like monopoly
40:33 - game will give you a chance to win a
40:34 - million dollars that sounds great so a
40:37 - ton of people they said okay cool i'm
40:39 - gonna go buy mcdonald's because i want
40:40 - to win this lottery right yeah
40:43 - in doing so who were they trusting
40:46 - mcdonald's they were trusting mcdonald's
40:47 - they were trusting to mcdonald's to
40:49 - actually give them a fair chance of
40:50 - winning and for years between like 13
40:53 - and 24 million dollars uh went to like
40:56 - some crime syndicate and you had a zero
40:59 - percent chance of winning right so you
41:01 - were trusting this entity where there
41:03 - was all this like you know behind closed
41:05 - doors like the lottery winners are
41:06 - getting picked behind closed doors so
41:08 - you were just assuming you were trusting
41:10 - they wouldn't do the right thing now you
41:12 - have this system where you're trusting
41:13 - mcdonald's to do the right thing
41:15 - versus on the blockchain you have a
41:16 - system where you can see
41:18 - everything that happens yeah and you can
41:21 - see exactly how the random candidates
41:22 - are chosen
41:24 - yeah
41:25 - like why would you why would you why
41:26 - would you ever use this world why would
41:28 - you ever use so there's this trust
41:29 - minimization or
41:31 - yeah and and i think like just so
41:46 - to to put like a little asterisk it
41:48 - might not have been mcdonald's fault
41:50 - they hired like you know but they were
41:51 - still they were still the one saying hey
41:53 - trust us we promise we'll give you a
41:55 - fair chance yeah right so like we
41:56 - trusted them but they kept picking like
41:59 - one group instead of giving people an
42:02 - equal chance
42:03 - but if it was done with a smart contract
42:06 - on the blockchain there would literally
42:08 - for developers on here it would
42:10 - literally be like an array and it would
42:12 - be like your array of the people which
42:14 - is everybody that's in the competition
42:15 - so it could be a thousand people or a
42:17 - hundred thousand million people and it'd
42:19 - be like random or whatever right in
42:22 - python you have the i forget but there's
42:24 - like you can import and select from the
42:26 - range and so it's like you just select
42:28 - random person you could see that code
42:31 - and that's the code that would pick and
42:32 - choose so the trust minimization that
42:35 - patrick is talking about i think here is
42:37 - like
42:37 - that you're talking about is you don't
42:39 - have to trust mcdonald's you you just
42:41 - see the code
42:43 - dude you got it i mean if you can see
42:44 - the code then you know and and that code
42:47 - would be publicly available to everybody
42:49 - that's participating in this challenge
42:51 - yeah in in solidity or viper whatever um
42:54 - because blockchains are deterministic
42:56 - there's actually no like dot random you
42:58 - can do pseudorandom which
43:00 - obviously isn't great um but you can use
43:03 - a chain like vrf which is a verifiably
43:05 - random function and that'll give you
43:07 - like a provably random number which is
43:09 - kind of mind-blowing that you can have a
43:11 - number that's like
43:12 - provably random um it's a
43:14 - cryptographically random yeah it's it's
43:16 - a little too big brain for me yeah i
43:18 - don't even think i understand how random
43:20 - works like i don't even understand how
43:22 - random works and like there are certain
43:24 - things that like really blow my [ __ ]
43:25 - mind right it's like how do you write an
43:28 - equation that goes one way and not the
43:29 - other like that
43:31 - always just like hurts
43:33 - so hard it's like
43:35 - you can go one like usually the formula
43:37 - to reverse engineer backwards is like if
43:40 - you wrote the equation how can it be
43:42 - that hard
43:43 - dude math is math is great and then
43:46 - or basically maybe the idea is you know
43:48 - what the equation is but in order to
43:50 - like go through the steps of that
43:51 - equation it's just so computationally
43:53 - challenging that we don't solve it in
43:55 - time that's idea right and then uh for
43:57 - for viewers watching uh he's he's
43:59 - referring to like hashes or private
44:01 - public key uh cryptography which what he
44:04 - just said is literally like the basis of
44:07 - all of cryptography like oh these
44:08 - algorithms are one way you can't go
44:10 - you can yeah
44:11 - yeah they're they're one way so
44:13 - basically you can go the other way but
44:15 - it just takes really long that's the
44:16 - idea right
44:18 - i i mean it's like is it impossible to
44:21 - go the other way well so think of it
44:23 - this way if you
44:25 - if you have um like a number that's 10
44:28 - to the if i'm thinking of a number
44:30 - between 0 and 2 raised to the 220
44:34 - 256th value which is like an insanely
44:37 - huge number
44:39 - um guess which number i'm thinking of
44:41 - that's kind of the
44:42 - uh that's kind of how it works like or
44:45 - or bigger or what so is it impossible
44:48 - it's like really just it's just it's
44:50 - like it's trial and error it's just
44:51 - trial and error like you just keep
44:52 - guessing until you get it which
44:54 - technically isn't impossible but like
44:56 - what super it takes super computers we
44:58 - were like hundreds of thousands
45:00 - future
45:01 - we might have computers that could
45:03 - probably brute force it
45:05 - or or if you waited or if you had one
45:07 - computer today then ran it for like a
45:10 - million years maybe it would get one so
45:12 - that you know if you want us if you want
45:14 - to steal someone's crypto that's the
45:16 - advice
45:17 - like imagine i was doing a short or like
45:19 - a video on this like like a parody like
45:22 - one minute thing like the
45:24 - crypt the
45:25 - the guy who hacked crypto or like broke
45:27 - the algorithm and it's like
45:29 - he like survives the [ __ ] ice age the
45:33 - he survives all of that and it like
45:35 - breaks into a wallet and it only has one
45:37 - dollar in it and then
45:38 - [Laughter]
45:41 - well he he should have checked either
45:42 - scan that was that was his first mistake
45:46 - yeah
45:46 - so okay but
45:48 - i i do want to give a quick second
45:51 - example uh because now you got me got me
45:53 - going uh because the the mcdonald's one
45:55 - is kind of like fun or whatever um but a
45:58 - a better a more impactful example that
46:00 - i'd like to give is
46:02 - transition or what trust minimization
46:03 - yeah a ton of people got screwed by
46:05 - robin hood right robin hood said nope
46:07 - can't buy these anymore what's up like
46:09 - where they're like you can't buy game
46:10 - stop stocks anymore can't buy gamestop
46:13 - stuff anymore or the other example i
46:15 - like to give is the 2008 financial
46:16 - crisis but that might be a longer story
46:18 - um but with gamestop they said you can't
46:20 - buy these anymore um you know and they
46:23 - even sold some for some people and
46:24 - whether or not it was their fault it
46:26 - doesn't really matter
46:27 - they had the ability they centralized
46:29 - ability to say nope we're flipping the
46:31 - switch you can't do this anymore even
46:33 - though they made this promise hey come
46:35 - use our platform we are democratizing
46:37 - finance
46:38 - like that was the promise that they made
46:41 - the end that they ultimately broke
46:43 - so and the uh
46:45 - the joke that was going around the
46:46 - crypto community was um
46:48 - there was somebody they posted like a
46:50 - picture of like a transaction on ether
46:52 - scan saying oh sorry um we've we've
46:54 - rejected your transaction because we
46:57 - have the power to do so and like the
46:58 - joke was like you can't because the code
47:00 - is immutable so uh
47:03 - yeah i mean that's yeah so that's a
47:05 - powerful example of it you know where
47:07 - like if you're on um if you're doing
47:10 - something on uniswap for example you can
47:13 - never get stopped it's
47:14 - it's in as long as computers exist and
47:16 - networks exist and
47:18 - like literally it can't be stopped
47:20 - there's no one entity that can like
47:22 - cops or the fed can't come in and be
47:24 - like hey shut this down
47:26 - it's that's like another interesting
47:28 - thing because there was um i was
47:29 - listening to a podcast on bankless
47:32 - banquets is a really sick podcast oh
47:33 - yeah i listened to a little bit of it oh
47:35 - yeah kevin rose did the one with
47:37 - bankless and i listened to that oh yeah
47:39 - oh hell yeah yeah they're they're great
47:41 - they're like um
47:43 - they're like the bro yes
47:45 - finance people um no they're they're
47:47 - good though they're they're they're good
47:49 - um
47:50 - yeah but uh they were talking with one
47:52 - of these guys who was down like in
47:53 - washington and they were talking about
47:54 - like yeah like some guy was like well if
47:56 - we really wanted to we would go around
47:59 - and we would track all the nodes down
48:01 - and take them down and i was like
48:04 - could you do that or or something along
48:07 - those lines and i was like
48:09 - like how would you
48:10 - track down
48:11 - kind of like how they caught the
48:13 - the people who stole 50 billion worth of
48:15 - bitcoin or something right the couple
48:17 - they like tracked all the nodes oh yeah
48:20 - well
48:20 - no that was that was different they just
48:22 - uh they did a poor job hiding their
48:24 - transactions uh like because again
48:26 - everything is transparent you know if
48:27 - you make transactions on chat you think
48:29 - if they came to you and you somebody who
48:31 - has all this knowledge and like you
48:34 - could like do you think you could help
48:35 - them get away with it
48:37 - because you're setting me up to get some
48:39 - pretty shady dms here
48:55 - to be honest maybe um but i mean there's
48:58 - there's also you know there's so much in
49:00 - this like i like to think i know a lot
49:01 - of stuff there's so many people who know
49:03 - way more than me right so maybe there's
49:05 - some weird back door i didn't think
49:06 - about that
49:08 - you know it would destroy me but i would
49:10 - definitely probably be able to to help
49:12 - but i wouldn't um that's the thing i'm
49:14 - too busy i'm i'm i'm trying to
49:16 - release the next free code camp video
49:18 - dude i don't have time to [ __ ] help
49:19 - your shady [ __ ]
49:20 - yeah not not you kazee whoever whoever's
49:24 - yeah yeah
49:26 - damn yeah i mean it's it's so well i'm
49:29 - sorry what were you saying though
49:30 - because i think you were talking about
49:31 - like reverse engineering nodes or
49:33 - something
49:34 - and i had oh yeah yeah they were
49:36 - i forgot what it was and and uh i feel
49:38 - like i'm just gonna
49:40 - say something stupid because i don't
49:41 - remember it somebody they were saying
49:42 - like oh like we would hunt down whoever
49:44 - deployed the contract or like we would
49:46 - hunt down like then
49:47 - yeah i'm back now i got to re-watch that
49:49 - episode to remember but i was like i was
49:51 - like that sounds ridiculous i don't know
49:53 - if that would be
49:54 - and by i don't know i mean like there's
49:56 - no way like
49:57 - like they haven't even cracked the onion
49:59 - network like how are you gonna
50:01 - what's on your network
50:02 - or
50:03 - excuse me like tour um excuse me like uh
50:07 - like like tour like the encrypted um
50:10 - encrypted torrent or something no so tor
50:13 - is like uh
50:14 - i forget what it stands for like the
50:16 - onion router or something like that
50:18 - um it's like a
50:19 - it's basically like an anonymous
50:21 - uh way to surf the internet like when
50:24 - you make a request to a website it kind
50:26 - of like scrambles it with other like
50:27 - computers so it's hard to see like where
50:29 - you're coming from
50:31 - oh i think i think it does i think it
50:33 - does some other stuff too i'm i'm
50:34 - definitely like not
50:36 - painting in its best light incognito
50:40 - i forget uh i know i know a lot about
50:42 - blockchain the networking stuff kind of
50:45 - yeah okay word perfect yeah get get him
50:47 - on the next podcast and we'll talk to
50:48 - her
50:49 - got it so like yeah yeah we'll bring him
50:51 - on hey break it break down the tour part
50:53 - he just comes in
50:54 - [Laughter]
50:56 - so so i think like okay so i understand
50:59 - there there's some parts about
51:00 - decentralization there's part about some
51:02 - trust minimization but like okay let's
51:03 - talk about like the
51:05 - uh i guess maybe a couple of things we
51:07 - can touch on and if you ever have to go
51:08 - just let me know i don't know dude i'm
51:10 - in
51:11 - i'm enjoying the conversation causing
51:13 - yeah my uh
51:14 - i blocked off the rest of the today to
51:16 - code so it's all good for me that is
51:18 - nice
51:20 - great way to do it dude because like
51:22 - otherwise you just like i miss coding
51:24 - and i don't get to code oh that's
51:25 - exciting it kind of makes me want to
51:28 - do well i was thinking of like like
51:29 - streaming my coding but then i'm like
51:31 - like i've done it before and i'm like
51:32 - just so much less productive because i'm
51:34 - like talking mom cody yeah yeah it's
51:36 - kind of like
51:37 - chess and i'm streaming chess like i
51:39 - play much worse man
51:41 - yeah there yep yeah exactly so but yeah
51:43 - dude if you get a chance to block off
51:44 - some time for coding it's like
51:46 - it's great it's like my favorite part of
51:48 - the day
51:49 - dude that is cool that is exciting um if
51:52 - i did blockchain coding i would jump in
51:55 - like if i did like full on maybe your
51:57 - skill level blockchain coding skills i
51:59 - would jump in with you but i'll i'll
52:00 - help you dude you need full stack
52:03 - in the same we could be in the same
52:05 - visual studio code on collab dude
52:08 - bro
52:09 - wait how sick if i'm like if i'm like
52:11 - writing all the back end [ __ ] and you're
52:12 - doing yo that would be sick actually
52:14 - that might be hella fun that would be a
52:16 - lot of fun
52:17 - how quickly can we build like a like a
52:19 - simple like nft marketplace or some [ __ ]
52:20 - you haven't i think you've already done
52:22 - that it's like some some weird [ __ ] like
52:23 - i'm like
52:25 - yeah that would be pretty cool our video
52:26 - would be a lot of fun because we could
52:27 - have like i could have somebody edit it
52:30 - and they could it would be more based on
52:32 - storytelling rather than like a tutorial
52:36 - um
52:38 - um one other thing is like
52:41 - yeah so if we did something like that or
52:42 - like we did uh i don't know simple
52:44 - blockchain challenges against each other
52:46 - and then see like and time each other
52:48 - you know
52:51 - yeah i did a video like that with a
52:53 - friend and we we battled each other with
52:54 - css so we got
52:56 - css challenge
52:58 - and then yeah we did it and then um i
53:00 - ended up winning so it's like
53:01 - entertaining video but now if i did it i
53:03 - have a lot of mr beast ideas in my head
53:06 - so i'm like
53:07 - it's like instead of one challenge
53:09 - taking 27 minutes his challenges each
53:12 - take like 50 seconds 40 seconds
53:14 - right
53:15 - in one video i would just like we you
53:17 - and i would just do 10 blockchain
53:19 - challenges
53:20 - you know or better yet i have somebody
53:23 - who i can pit against you
53:26 - oh [ __ ]
53:28 - so like you guys do the [ __ ]
53:30 - blockchain challenge i become the game
53:31 - show host and whoever wins gets like ten
53:33 - thousand dollars
53:35 - yo all right i'm in i'm in wait wait i
53:37 - know i know some coders too like uh yeah
53:40 - i know some people who could do it like
53:41 - this is my brother he's you know he's
53:43 - been coding for a week him and i we're
53:45 - great competition uh i'll blow him away
53:48 - and win the ten thousand dollars every
53:49 - single time so that sounds good to me
53:51 - yeah there you go okay but actually
53:55 - yeah no i and uh yeah i i know some
53:57 - people who would be who probably would
53:58 - would destroy me too um dude that sounds
54:00 - like a ton of fun
54:01 - yeah
54:02 - experience you have with blockchain
54:06 - i've been coding
54:08 - uh like solidity stuff for like the past
54:10 - two and a half years at this point wow
54:12 - which
54:13 - what the thing is like senior senior
54:15 - little dude because like people are
54:17 - starting a month ago
54:19 - dude which is so funny to think about
54:21 - yeah because like uh we you talk to like
54:24 - like a react developer right or like a
54:27 - uh or maybe not react it's the best
54:28 - example because they're kind of a
54:29 - javascript developer and i say like oh
54:31 - two and a half years they're like yeah
54:32 - i've been coding javascript for [ __ ]
54:33 - 20.
54:34 - right it's uh
54:36 - totally different yeah like i mean
54:38 - because the max you can be is like five
54:40 - years really six years let's talk about
54:43 - the money dude if ethereum developer
54:45 - solidity developer they're coding for
54:49 - half a year one year
54:51 - how much money are they making on like
54:53 - if they're if they're like um
54:56 - let's say they're in us let's just start
54:58 - there they're in u.s they know what
54:59 - they're doing
55:01 - they've been doing it for
55:03 - half a year a year
55:04 - like what type of salary range are we
55:06 - talking
55:07 - yeah it's
55:09 - it definitely ranges um
55:12 - if you're like super noob stuff
55:15 - it can still be kind of like a normal
55:17 - like developer like it could be like 80
55:19 - 90k like if you're
55:23 - we're talking about like pretty much
55:25 - junior level people yeah we're talking
55:27 - about junior level people i mean
55:29 - and the the thing is most projects
55:31 - aren't looking for junior level people
55:32 - um because
55:34 - senior well
55:35 - because it's just um
55:38 - like most products like need to move
55:40 - quick and they're like building quick uh
55:42 - but the good thing is like the i think
55:44 - the startups that are like a little bit
55:46 - more open-minded realize that okay like
55:48 - if we get a bunch of junior developers
55:50 - they probably can still build something
55:51 - really sick right like most junior
55:54 - solidity developers are learning crazy
55:56 - [ __ ] fast yeah and are gonna be
55:58 - learning on the fly and building really
56:00 - cool [ __ ] so yeah like like low end i'm
56:03 - gonna say it's like 80 to 90. high end
56:05 - is is is nuts dude high end
56:08 - high ends i wouldn't be surprised if the
56:10 - average
56:12 - is like
56:14 - like 150 170. uh i think i think crypto
56:18 - jobs list quoted it a lot lower though i
56:20 - think like a couple of like
56:22 - here's what people are making quoted at
56:23 - like 120 130. but dude dude i've seen
56:27 - i've seen [ __ ] for like 500 plus tokens
56:30 - yeah like um
56:32 - i don't i don't know how legit those are
56:34 - yeah um and i don't i don't personally
56:37 - know anybody who's doing that i've seen
56:39 - [ __ ] like that but yeah i do know people
56:41 - who are doing 180 plus tokens 200 plus
56:44 - tokens you know um so that's that's
56:46 - pretty like within the realm of doable
56:47 - okay i don't know what 100 200 tokens
56:49 - means what what sorry like like how like
56:53 - i thought we were talking about usd like
56:54 - people make hundred fifty thousand oh no
56:56 - no
56:57 - sorry like like 200k 200k plus tokens
57:01 - like 200k plus like the equivalent of
57:03 - the stock options and
57:06 - got i got it okay yeah which which and i
57:08 - say like plus tokens because if the the
57:10 - project sucks like it tanks and it's
57:12 - like all right well i got nothing for
57:13 - these tokens these tokens project is
57:15 - good like um i don't know if you know
57:17 - alex becker and the crypto community is
57:19 - huge
57:20 - oh
57:21 - well now i feel silly i don't know alex
57:23 - becker alex
57:25 - how do you spell his last name um alex
57:27 - becker so a-l-e-x and then b-e-c-k-e-r
57:32 - okay so he's more like uh influencer
57:35 - slash somebody who talks a lot about
57:37 - crypto
57:38 - uh oh [ __ ] 800 000 followers okay yeah
57:42 - on youtube he's he should be past a
57:44 - million subs now
57:45 - really yeah and like each video he was
57:48 - dropping on crypto dude was doing like
57:49 - half a million views and you could do
57:50 - those styles really yeah
57:53 - um but like yeah he just talks about
57:55 - crypto stuff and he launched his own nft
57:58 - project have you ever heard of neo tokyo
58:01 - i'm not
58:02 - so anyways like his developer that got
58:04 - on it
58:05 - it now makes like has made over seven
58:08 - figures like in less than a year
58:10 - wow
58:11 - yeah so i feel like some some projects
58:13 - if you get on that are like good
58:15 - projects i mean it's
58:16 - kind of [ __ ] nuts you know my friend
58:18 - just like minted uh neo tokyo and it's
58:21 - uh and if he sells it today it's worth
58:24 - quarter million and he got it for free
58:26 - that's that's one of the things that
58:28 - like
58:29 - is really exciting and it's good about
58:30 - this space that there's like so much
58:32 - there's a lot of economic opportunity
58:34 - here and people like it hyped and like
58:35 - yo i'm trying to make bank
58:37 - yeah it also is like
58:39 - it also has a downside where you have
58:41 - all these you you you get a ton of
58:43 - people who come in and they go yo i'm
58:44 - gonna join this project early because
58:46 - and i want to be like you know what this
58:48 - alex becker guy did and they just get
58:50 - [ __ ] wrecked and that that always
58:52 - breaks my heart or like
58:54 - the thing that happens all the time is
58:56 - like a new protocol launches and
58:58 - somebody goes oh my god like i'm gonna
59:00 - be the first one on this protocol like
59:02 - i'm gonna get all these rewards it's
59:03 - gonna be great and they just get [ __ ]
59:05 - rugged yeah um
59:07 - so it comes with a downside and the
59:09 - other downside is that likes a lot of
59:10 - people view the industry as like
59:13 - this stupid cash grab yeah
59:15 - which to a lot of people it is and and
59:17 - and if that's if that's what gets you
59:19 - into the space you know so be it um i
59:21 - mean i'm not going to lie
59:23 - dude we talked about this right
59:25 - i get it
59:27 - when i'm like
59:29 - monkeys and making this much money i'm
59:31 - like let me start paying attention to
59:32 - this but then like i came for the
59:35 - monkeys and i stayed for the
59:36 - decentralization bro
59:39 - dude
59:40 - for for me it was the uh it was a
59:42 - combination of the memes the promise and
59:43 - the money it was like all three like
59:46 - like to me like the the memes in the
59:48 - space are hilarious the fact that like
59:50 - like a super super [ __ ] serious event
59:54 - the the mascot is a half buffalo half
59:57 - [ __ ] unicorn half like pigeon right
60:01 - to me that is phenom and that's that's
60:03 - eat denver one to me that's phenomenal
60:05 - like you have this ridiculous
60:07 - yeah which you should have came dude
60:09 - next time next time i was too late
60:13 - yeah next next year next year next year
60:15 - yeah eat denver's super sick but uh yeah
60:17 - like we like it's it's this crazy weird
60:19 - i forget where i was going with this
60:20 - crazy weird community but yeah like it's
60:23 - i got into it for the money for the for
60:24 - the uh for the decentrality and for the
60:27 - memes and yeah now that i'm here i'm
60:28 - like holy [ __ ] [ __ ] uh yeah there's
60:31 - well
60:32 - actually that's not even true because uh
60:34 - it was it was even more for the um
60:37 - the future because i was like i was
60:39 - researching smart contracts and i was
60:40 - like holy [ __ ] like all these [ __ ]
60:42 - issues in finance that i saw
60:46 - i'm like holy [ __ ] like this is the
60:48 - answer
60:49 - this is the [ __ ] answer so yeah so i
60:51 - i i i it caught my attention because of
60:54 - all that [ __ ] but yeah i was like holy
60:56 - [ __ ] [ __ ] because of all like the
60:59 - cool stuff that this technology enables
61:01 - so i mean yeah i i totally agree with
61:03 - that like it enables so many cool things
61:06 - i think like
61:08 - you know one of the things that i'm
61:09 - thinking about is how do you see average
61:12 - users getting into this space right so
61:14 - for example some thoughts at the top of
61:16 - my head are like
61:18 - you know um things like solana pay that
61:21 - just releases pay you can actually go to
61:23 - a real store
61:24 - flip out your phone and like just pay
61:26 - what's a lot of pay
61:28 - right so that makes it look kind of real
61:30 - world
61:31 - how do you see it becoming a more no not
61:34 - just for in people looking to make a
61:37 - quick buck on nfts but more people
61:39 - switching into it
61:42 - yeah i i think one of the biggest steps
61:44 - i i think the first big pillar to fall
61:47 - is gonna be well it's already falling
61:49 - it's gonna be defy right like all these
61:53 - um
61:54 - investing asymmetries and this
61:56 - unfairness like all there's so many
61:58 - advantages that d5 gives like the common
62:01 - person that i think like that is the the
62:03 - entry point that's going to be the first
62:05 - thing i think that's going to be the
62:06 - first thing to go mainstream
62:08 - some could argue that nfts have gone
62:10 - mainstream but i i don't
62:12 - i i think nfts are great but like the
62:15 - val the real value i feel like is um for
62:18 - like for like making people's well-being
62:20 - better is more in defy um i think nfcs
62:23 - are really cool i think they're
62:24 - fantastic
62:25 - um but yeah i think like the the normal
62:28 - person who wants to have a better life
62:30 - it's d5 right because they can invest in
62:32 - all these these really cool uh
62:34 - financial products they can invest much
62:37 - easier yeah um and they can kind of they
62:39 - can have access to this financial world
62:42 - they weren't able to have access before
62:44 - um one of the things i really did like
62:46 - about robinhood was they were originally
62:48 - their mission was that as well and i i
62:50 - think it still is but they [ __ ] up a
62:52 - little bit um so like give people access
62:54 - to to easily like
62:56 - be a part of markets
62:59 - and i think crypto is really the
63:01 - fulfillment of that vision
63:04 - uh with like a provably fair done in
63:06 - approvally fair way so i think d5 i
63:09 - think like a lot of the investing um
63:11 - like moving away from kind of
63:13 - traditional stocks to
63:14 - to crypto stuff i think that's kind of
63:16 - the first foray um and that's one of the
63:18 - first things for for i mean once money
63:20 - moves there
63:22 - pretty much everything that's gonna then
63:23 - fall like a domino effect right that's
63:25 - that's actually kind of a big big thing
63:28 - i think so yeah
63:30 - why what do you think
63:32 - um i man i don't know like honestly it's
63:35 - definitely a tough one to kind of
63:38 - predict
63:39 - like i i get certain ideas around nfts
63:42 - and i'm like oh just like for example
63:44 - uh if you get nnft to gary v's fly fish
63:48 - club or whatever he launched you could
63:50 - then now they're launching the service
63:52 - where you could lease it out to other
63:53 - people so you could own it but you could
63:55 - lease it out to other people or let them
63:57 - rent and i'm like that's such a cool
63:59 - concept because imagine if for three
64:01 - months i'm like you know what i'm really
64:02 - not using my netflix subscription but
64:05 - instead of canceling it what if i could
64:06 - let somebody borrow it for three months
64:08 - i don't know like that would be pretty
64:10 - cool um
64:13 - the thing that i do causey is anytime
64:15 - like one of my buddies is like yo like
64:17 - how do i how do i crypto i go okay get a
64:19 - mask wallet
64:21 - i'll send you i'll send you 10 20
64:24 - will will stick you uh uh we'll stick
64:27 - some money into ave on polygon we'll let
64:29 - you [ __ ] around the fees are super cheap
64:31 - there you can start playing with d5 on
64:34 - polygon and then boom like everyone i've
64:36 - done that with it's like holy [ __ ] this
64:37 - is so sick this is so easy it's like
64:40 - yeah the the thing that you talk about
64:42 - like oh my god i can i can like
64:43 - literally like move
64:45 - all like a [ __ ] ton of money
64:47 - in like a second like are you are you
64:49 - kidding me like so that's what i say i
64:50 - say go play on ave on polygon network
64:54 - have fun
64:55 - yeah come back to me when you have more
64:57 - questions yeah i think yeah like for for
65:00 - me what i see is i think the the user
65:03 - experience needs to just be really
65:05 - simplified so i think of like a little
65:07 - bit more yeah it's like think apple
65:08 - versus
65:10 - like um
65:11 - i don't know like a google computer or
65:13 - like a regular microsoft computer uh or
65:16 - a phone
65:17 - they they simplified things and they
65:19 - kept taking things away
65:21 - and the more they took things away
65:24 - it just made the user experience so easy
65:26 - and i feel like that's why a lot of
65:28 - people
65:28 - you know go after apple products because
65:30 - they're just simple you even kind of
65:31 - forget that there's so much technology
65:33 - behind it i feel like with the crypto
65:35 - space
65:36 - it's
65:38 - it's like there's too many options
65:40 - available like i i go to send money and
65:42 - then it asks me for my slippage i'm like
65:44 - what the [ __ ] like i just want to
65:46 - buy something i have no idea what this
65:47 - is right i know
65:49 - come
65:50 - and and it's almost like right now it
65:53 - feels like in order to drive a car you
65:54 - also have to be a [ __ ] car engineer
65:57 - like no i just want to drive the car
65:59 - like just give me a gas pedal and
66:00 - whatever so i feel like
66:02 - when things like meta masks become a lot
66:04 - easier to sign up for and use because i
66:07 - i can't tell my dad to sign up for this
66:08 - he there's no way
66:10 - you know he won't get it or like
66:12 - somebody like if i even tell my
66:14 - girlfriend
66:15 - she's on instagram all day she's all
66:17 - this she's a pro boxer but like
66:19 - this is too involved in the tech world
66:21 - where she won't she will be like super
66:23 - confused setting up a metamask wallet so
66:25 - i feel like when those things become
66:28 - really easy
66:30 - i feel like a lot more people in my
66:33 - opinion would start jumping in because
66:34 - then there would be even a lot less fear
66:37 - yeah no i i think you're right i think
66:39 - user experience is probably going to be
66:41 - one of the biggest things
66:42 - and uh
66:44 - i i forced my uh my girlfriend to get a
66:46 - meta mask so that's maybe that's the i
66:49 - was like yo you need to do this well
66:50 - although she doesn't she like got it and
66:52 - like she hasn't touched it since i you
66:53 - know yeah um but uh
66:55 - yeah no i i agree i think user once as
66:58 - user experience gets better it'll just
67:00 - get better and better and that's another
67:01 - reason why i'm doing what i'm doing
67:03 - teaching the engineers how to like code
67:05 - because
67:05 - right it's that they're going to be the
67:07 - ones that are going to build it right
67:08 - they're going to be they want to build
67:09 - the user experience and make it easier
67:12 - and friendlier
67:13 - um and then i imagine at some points
67:15 - lots of companies will start making it
67:17 - where like i could go to amazon and buy
67:18 - in usdt like i think like
67:20 - once these big [ __ ] companies that we
67:24 - all know and love like
67:25 - once that starts happening or youtube
67:27 - starts sending me adsense in usdc like i
67:30 - feel like
67:31 - when the big player starts moving i
67:33 - think that might lead to mass adoption
67:35 - yeah
67:38 - i think you're right
67:40 - yeah so uh those are kind of my thoughts
67:42 - there
67:43 - uh and i think we touch base on solidity
67:45 - and okay if a developer
67:48 - goes into the space how much money can
67:50 - they realistically make
67:51 - um
67:53 - but also like
67:54 - how much experience does somebody need
67:56 - before they can start applying for jobs
67:57 - so like for example say i'm a developer
67:59 - with one or two years of experience with
68:01 - the traditional full stack development
68:04 - i'm pretty decent i have a couple of
68:05 - projects on my portfolio
68:07 - and i want to now join the blockchain
68:08 - world do i have to wait a couple of
68:10 - years before i can start applying for
68:11 - blockchain jobs or what's the process
68:13 - there no
68:15 - so here's what here's what i usually
68:16 - tell people and then it could be i think
68:19 - years isn't a great
68:21 - indicator because it's whatever time
68:22 - frame you can do this in here's what i
68:24 - usually think step one take a tutorial a
68:27 - course doesn't matter which one you can
68:29 - take my free code camp one it's great
68:31 - dappy university's got some great ones
68:33 - uh eat the blocks got some great ones
68:34 - you know you can watch all of all of
68:36 - qazi's videos uh what whatever i don't
68:39 - care right like do some type of tutorial
68:41 - get into it that's step one get the
68:44 - basics get like that basic solidity
68:46 - viper if you're using solana rust i
68:48 - don't care what's fun
68:50 - mentioning that i don't know what that
68:51 - is oh it's it's a it's a pythonic uh
68:53 - smart contract language so it's it's
68:55 - basically the
68:56 - if solidity is to javascript python or
68:59 - viper is to python
69:01 - so you you can write evm you can write
69:04 - ethereum smart contracts and viper it's
69:06 - a super sick language too
69:08 - uh it's used a lot less though like
69:10 - curve iron.finance those are some of the
69:12 - big ones that use it uh but yeah pick a
69:15 - language doesn't matter which one and go
69:16 - and learn something once you do that
69:19 - the next thing to absolutely do
69:21 - especially right now is join a hackathon
69:24 - and force yourself to like take what
69:26 - you've learned and like build something
69:27 - else
69:28 - because
69:29 - you're gonna meet a ton of people you're
69:31 - gonna get a ton of skills from going to
69:34 - a hackathon and you're going to force
69:35 - yourself to kind of
69:37 - leave what i call tutorial hell
69:40 - so join a hackathon right because
69:42 - that's where you're going to push
69:43 - yourself you're going to take all the
69:44 - tutorial stuff and you're going to run
69:45 - into real problems you're going to run
69:47 - into more problems that are outside the
69:48 - tutorial right tutorials are great and i
69:51 - make a ton of them but usually when you
69:52 - take those learnings and you go to the
69:54 - real world there's like oh but i want to
69:56 - tweak this like this or do this and that
69:58 - might be harder so force yourself to run
69:59 - into those problems and build something
70:02 - submit
70:03 - something the other thing that's really
70:05 - cool about these hackathons is
70:07 - there's a ton of money in them right now
70:09 - so that's also good you can have the
70:11 - chance to win but don't really think
70:13 - about like the winnings really just
70:14 - focus on okay i'm here to learn and
70:16 - build something and then also network
70:19 - i've seen
70:20 - tons of projects come out of hackathons
70:23 - and then become like protocols right so
70:25 - if you're into that
70:27 - you could leave a hackathon and
70:29 - become a protocol so one of the uh
70:31 - projects from the last chainlink
70:32 - hackathon this product struck finance
70:35 - this was like
70:36 - maybe four months ago they just did they
70:39 - i i think they met at the hackathon i
70:41 - could be wrong i don't actually i'd have
70:43 - to double check but yeah four months ago
70:45 - they did the challenging hackathon they
70:46 - just raised 3.9 million dollars
70:49 - so
70:50 - yeah so like this [ __ ] moves quick so if
70:53 - you do well at a hackathon
70:55 - go on make the protocol the other thing
70:57 - is they're headhunters at these
70:59 - hackathons so if you do really well
71:00 - maybe you don't even need to apply
71:01 - because someone's going to reach out and
71:02 - be like yo
71:04 - i want to hire you they're headhunters
71:06 - at these hackathons
71:07 - um
71:08 - but after that uh even you know if no
71:10 - headhunter reaches out to you then
71:12 - that's when you can start applying right
71:13 - after you start building some protocols
71:15 - uh and start feeling really competent so
71:18 - maybe that takes you four months maybe
71:20 - that takes you a year and a half maybe
71:22 - that takes you three years right yeah
71:25 - however long it takes you but yeah just
71:28 - start applying along the way um the
71:30 - other question i get a lot is
71:33 - internships can i go to an internship
71:35 - where can i internship
71:36 - blockchain and smart contracts are kind
71:38 - of these this wild world where like your
71:41 - internships are like everywhere yeah but
71:45 - but they're not traditional internships
71:47 - to me you're going to get a lot lot
71:49 - better um
71:51 - experience going to like maybe someone's
71:53 - github
71:54 - and trying to work on an issue or
71:56 - something
71:56 - right
71:57 - or going to some open source project and
72:00 - say oh hey like i really like this
72:02 - feature you know can i work on this or
72:04 - can i do that there's all these
72:06 - protocols have grants where they'll give
72:08 - out money for you to work on something
72:09 - and you're going to get
72:11 - way better experience doing that than
72:13 - like getting someone's coffee is like an
72:15 - intern or whatever right so so like go
72:18 - out like use the the fact that
72:20 - blockchain is so ridiculously open
72:22 - source is like your advantage it's like
72:24 - holy [ __ ] there's so many places that i
72:26 - can learn and work with people
72:28 - uh and learn from other people so
72:30 - it's like
72:31 - every company
72:32 - almost every company on the blockchain
72:34 - is open source in that way so like yeah
72:36 - wow
72:37 - yeah learn learn from all and like the
72:39 - other cool thing is like all of the
72:40 - tutorials that i do are like based off
72:42 - of these like insane protocols because
72:45 - all their code is open source so if you
72:47 - want to see okay what does ave do what
72:49 - does synthetics do what does compound do
72:52 - yeah the code's right there
72:54 - link or we'll pop up the link to the
72:56 - channel in the description and then also
72:58 - we'll show something on the screen right
72:59 - now
73:00 - and i think patrick collins if we just
73:03 - type that in on youtube your tutorials
73:05 - and videos should come up right and um
73:07 - even the one that i started actually
73:09 - learning solidity with is patrick's
73:11 - video that's how i know him it was i was
73:14 - in dubai and i went to free code camp
73:17 - not i didn't go to free code camp
73:18 - actually i typed in solidity tutorial
73:21 - and then patrick's popped up with two
73:23 - million views and it's just a [ __ ]
73:24 - banger yeah i like played it
73:27 - me and my team watched like so many
73:29 - hours worth of it and like learned a ton
73:32 - so
73:33 - um yeah and then you saw it was python
73:35 - and then
73:36 - you're like
73:38 - three hours in but like i watched the
73:40 - two three hours bro and i was hooked so
73:42 - i would highly recommend you guys watch
73:44 - that to learn solidity definitely and we
73:46 - got a javascript one with hard hat
73:48 - coming out
73:49 - soon-ish
73:51 - very soon-ish
73:53 - so
73:53 - definitely be sure to check that out
73:54 - it's gonna be sick like anybody who like
73:57 - oh my god like i'm i'm filming it right
73:59 - now dude oh my god it's so [ __ ] sick
74:02 - that's sick i'm excited for that one i'm
74:04 - excited
74:06 - if you get in this space and you're like
74:08 - yo like i'm trying to learn this [ __ ]
74:09 - dude like watch one of those two videos
74:11 - because at the end you're gonna be
74:12 - golden you're gonna be good to go like
74:14 - that
74:15 - all right like i said watch whatever
74:16 - tutorial and watch whatever tutorial but
74:17 - if you watch mine and you like actually
74:19 - go through it you are going to come out
74:21 - the other side [ __ ] swinging ready
74:25 - [ __ ] swinging right and so it'll be
74:26 - like 20 hours or something like that the
74:28 - first one was 16. yeah it's gonna take
74:30 - you a couple months to actually like
74:32 - watch it and digest but like dude it's
74:34 - like sick it's so good worth it
74:37 - all right awesome i feel like we covered
74:39 - a lot of the road map of how do you
74:41 - actually become a blockchain engineer or
74:44 - a solidity developer or whatever are
74:46 - there any other parts you want to add to
74:47 - it or you feel like
74:49 - it's pretty good what we have for it so
74:51 - far
74:53 - i think that's pretty good i mean the
74:54 - rest of it's kind of like the
74:55 - traditional you know keep learning keep
74:57 - grinding right like if nobody's hiring
75:00 - you
75:01 - keep learning keep grinding keep keep
75:03 - your github repo is your
75:05 - um is your resume your github repo and
75:08 - then also you know your your regular
75:10 - resume is also your resume but these are
75:12 - the products that i've worked on this is
75:14 - what i know how to do
75:15 - um something else i usually recommend to
75:17 - people is um if you are looking for a
75:20 - job like start writing some articles
75:22 - right start making a little bit of
75:23 - content do some tutorials did you work
75:25 - on something really cool great make it
75:26 - write an article about it there's great
75:29 - places like dev.2
75:30 - you can just rip an article and now
75:32 - that's kind of like part of your resume
75:33 - as well like this is here this is what i
75:35 - know how to do
75:36 - uh and maybe that's a good way to get
75:37 - your name out there i know that us devs
75:40 - are usually a little bit more shy
75:42 - but it's still a great way to get out
75:43 - there and um
75:45 - and then maybe you just do it you get
75:46 - the job and then you stop writing and
75:47 - that's fine too
75:48 - yeah yeah 100 i mean yeah there are a
75:51 - lot of um i feel like there's
75:53 - a huge demand and the supply is a lot
75:57 - smaller like even
75:59 - for us we were looking for blockchain
76:01 - engineers and we're looking to bring
76:02 - some on
76:03 - you can even hire them and it's like
76:05 - it's [ __ ] hard and all the people
76:07 - were interviewing are like yeah i have
76:09 - two months of experience you know i
76:10 - started coding like
76:12 - solidity
76:14 - you know those are some of the best
76:15 - candidates we have we're like like we
76:18 - recently came across a couple that have
76:19 - like one or two years of experience and
76:21 - stuff and we're like yo this is
76:23 - this is great um
76:26 - one person
76:27 - yeah i'm really excited about but he's
76:29 - uh you're currently a senior blockchain
76:31 - engineer at meta and was ex google oh
76:34 - [ __ ] oh [ __ ]
76:36 - watkins is 2013.
76:39 - oh my god and he wants to work with us
76:42 - and i was like what the [ __ ] i'm like
76:43 - why do you want to work
76:47 - we're just youtubers dude
76:48 - [Laughter]
76:50 - and uh
76:51 - and uh i think yeah so like he wants to
76:54 - also be in some of the videos so he's
76:55 - excited about that oh hell yeah okay um
76:58 - i would just say why does he that i mean
77:00 - i mean that's [ __ ] sick right is it
77:02 - because of the videos and stuff uh yeah
77:04 - i mean it's like of course we're gonna
77:05 - have him on a team he's gonna get paid
77:07 - oh yeah and so that's nice um but then
77:09 - on top of that there's gonna be some
77:11 - videos we're gonna have them in and i'm
77:12 - thinking to have been like some really
77:14 - cool like epic videos um i got a couple
77:17 - of ideas dude like even off this podcast
77:19 - i would love to brainstorm some video
77:21 - ideas with you just like create one
77:23 - creator to another creator um yeah
77:25 - because i was i was actually recently
77:27 - feeling like [ __ ] man i to brainstorm
77:29 - with somebody and i come up with ideas
77:31 - but most people aren't creators you know
77:33 - and like you are so
77:34 - um
77:35 - i will hit you up i will hit you up i'm
77:37 - excited about that actually seriously um
77:40 - i love to do this walk
77:41 - marina and like i just go on this long
77:44 - walks and then i just whoa
77:46 - dude a walking meeting oh yeah i'm game
77:48 - yeah i have i have to walk 7000 steps a
77:51 - day because i'm like trying to be less
77:53 - fat so hell yeah that sounds good
77:55 - ah you don't look fat you look like
77:56 - jacked i'm i'm bigger than i want to be
78:00 - uh i told people i was bulking so
78:02 - however
78:04 - i mean yeah like i feel like you're a
78:06 - fit dude you have the [ __ ]
78:07 - thanksgiving water next to you
78:10 - it's
78:11 - yeah the 64 ounce uh 64. i gotta i gotta
78:15 - [Laughter]
78:19 - just walks around with it everywhere
78:20 - dude dude i want to be one of those gym
78:22 - guys who who has like the milk carton
78:24 - yeah that's his water bottle
78:26 - i think those are fantastic so this is
78:28 - like a little bit less but yeah still
78:31 - like bigger than my [ __ ] head
78:32 - like we should just get jacked and have
78:34 - tank tops
78:37 - gallon of milk and writing smart
78:39 - contracts under time crunch dude
78:41 - dude one of my uh
78:43 - one of the one of the videos that i have
78:45 - planned i want to do some weird [ __ ] at
78:47 - the gym and then like have like a laptop
78:49 - where i'm like uh because so there's
78:51 - this new framework that just came out
78:52 - foundry it's it's rust based it's super
78:54 - fast it's really powerful
78:56 - and like the joke
78:58 - god what's gonna say you write in rust
79:01 - uh no so it's it's rust based it's
79:03 - command land base so you just do on the
79:05 - command line you don't have to actually
79:06 - do any rust i mean i have written rust
79:08 - stuff but yeah the joke that i was gonna
79:10 - make was like oh it's so powerful and
79:11 - i'm like [ __ ] dead lifting or some
79:13 - [ __ ]
79:14 - but then i was like that's i don't i
79:16 - don't know if that's that's too [ __ ]
79:17 - corny
79:18 - this framework is too good
79:20 - the striker is too powerful
79:24 - what this happens with creators right
79:25 - like you'll think of an idea and then
79:27 - you go i don't know if it's too corny
79:29 - and like when you execute it sometimes
79:31 - it's like way shittier than you had
79:33 - imagined and it's like really yeah what
79:35 - the [ __ ] like i really thought it was
79:36 - gonna go but like now i don't even get
79:38 - it like what's the joke
79:40 - um i have it's me all the time but i'm
79:42 - sure it does yeah one thing i thought
79:44 - about is like you can't ever give up on
79:47 - that part of yourself because that's the
79:49 - true creator and like that [ __ ] will
79:52 - breed so much lack of confidence in
79:54 - yourself when you keep having ideas and
79:55 - you know you keep not doing them
79:58 - and then like you just keep getting less
79:59 - and less confident as a creator so i
80:02 - feel like it's like even if you think
80:03 - it's the dumbest [ __ ] or whatever it's
80:04 - like just go [ __ ] do the deadlift
80:07 - with the laptop in your hand like this
80:08 - is [ __ ] powerful uh like make it a 20
80:11 - second short and drop it you know but
80:12 - like that way you just keep increasing
80:14 - your confidence and like what you set
80:16 - what you thought you were going to do
80:17 - you actually do it
80:18 - all right cozy i'm taking those words to
80:20 - heart next video i drop i'm going to be
80:22 - [ __ ] dead lifting and doing some
80:23 - weird [ __ ] dude
80:26 - i thought tutorial that broke 2 million
80:28 - views i had this random idea that i'm
80:30 - gonna be by the ocean and i'm just gonna
80:32 - be waving the laptop in one arm like
80:34 - with one hand and i'm just like talking
80:36 - and i'm like doing push-ups and [ __ ]
80:38 - when i'm teaching for loops i'm like
80:40 - here's what range of ten and then i did
80:42 - ten push-ups and then i got up with a
80:44 - laptop and i'm just like coding and it
80:45 - goes back to the coding screen it's like
80:46 - [ __ ] crazy
80:48 - what that's phenomenal yeah oh my
80:51 - goodness
80:52 - um now i want to do i want to do a
80:53 - random push-up soon i'm coding that
80:55 - sounds [ __ ] sick yeah just like
80:59 - i'm imagining like um
81:01 - like doing [ __ ] bench presses and
81:03 - then like sitting up like from the bench
81:06 - press and like a table sliding over to
81:08 - like and then you just say all right now
81:09 - it's time to code for my [ __ ] rest
81:11 - that [ __ ] is funny dude it's like
81:13 - octopus when i was watching your
81:15 - tutorial i'm like oh like another
81:17 - [ __ ]
81:18 - professor person teaching [ __ ] you know
81:20 - with green screens and i was like oh
81:22 - this is gonna be cringy and i like
81:24 - watching it but then like you were
81:26 - dropping some references and also the
81:28 - way you speak i'm like this guy sounds
81:30 - like a savage i'm like i like this guy
81:32 - and i'm like this is [ __ ] cool i want
81:34 - to learn this so it was weird like it
81:37 - made me want to learn
81:39 - as i like bought into more of who you
81:41 - were
81:42 - you know and so i feel like
81:44 - if you just like interdisperse like
81:46 - random [ __ ] that you like in the
81:48 - tutorials
81:50 - like whether it's chess or league of
81:51 - legend references or like gym references
81:55 - i think it will it'll just make people
81:57 - like you and connect with you a lot more
82:00 - quasi we gotta so when we get on these
82:02 - brainstorming calls like we'll i'll i'll
82:05 - give you all the solidity knowledge and
82:06 - then you just keep feeding me the
82:07 - youtube [ __ ] i'm with it sounds great
82:11 - you keep giving me the tricks of the
82:12 - trade man i'm down
82:14 - yeah that's that's where we're headed um
82:17 - all right bro i think this was
82:18 - phenomenal if we ever do one in the
82:20 - future i think like we'll just do a live
82:22 - one because it'll be i think we'll uh
82:24 - we'll take questions and stuff um yeah
82:26 - yeah yeah
82:28 - because yeah i thought we riffed here
82:29 - really well so i'm yeah i'm game i think
82:31 - i think there was no like uh
82:35 - performance issues like yeah i think
82:37 - this would be a lot of fun to just rip
82:38 - live too
82:40 - performances we're about to jump into a
82:42 - bluetooth sponsored ad or something
82:45 - um
82:47 - uh what is it what did uh
82:50 - ray kroc now [ __ ] i forget it yeah yeah
82:52 - no i i hear what you're saying you have
82:54 - performance issues drink this creatine
82:57 - sponsored by g fuel
83:00 - yeah we should get sponsors on these
83:01 - videos man
83:03 - get get g fuel a red bull on the two of
83:05 - us just like go [ __ ] nuts for a solid
83:07 - 60's
83:10 - you want to talk smart contracts i got
83:12 - you
83:18 - what have the best [ __ ] code of your
83:19 - life dude i'm gay i did one video on
83:22 - like tic tac it like blew up and it's
83:23 - like
83:25 - and it starts and i'm just like i stand
83:26 - up and i'm going all crazy and i'm like
83:32 - she
83:34 - yes and then the in the
83:37 - caption we wrote like when a javascript
83:39 - developer like uh discovers react for
83:41 - the first time
83:44 - and he's like rolling this up and he
83:45 - goes like this and it's just react logo
83:47 - and he like injects it into his [ __ ]
83:49 - arm
83:50 - and like i want like blew up and like
83:52 - got like almost a million views and i'm
83:53 - like yo let's we gotta do more of these
83:57 - hell yeah man so so wait so do you edit
83:59 - this too or it's just like all right you
84:00 - just rip it um i yeah we will edit it i
84:03 - have a team of editors
84:05 - all right cool all right so that that's
84:07 - why we're like all right we're
84:09 - gonna make the audio and everything
84:10 - really good so yeah
84:12 - yeah yeah that's why we did it like this
84:14 - so we'll have editor that'll like find
84:16 - the thing that'll be like the most like
84:18 - they'll hook the most yeah yeah yeah um
84:21 - and then like we'll start it off with
84:22 - that the video punch in and punch out
84:24 - it'll be like super entertaining
84:26 - um
84:27 - yeah so normally ask people what their
84:28 - biggest regret is or something crazy and
84:30 - then like we make that
84:33 - that's what i did with the co-founder of
84:34 - twitch like we made the hook oh [ __ ]
84:36 - what was his what was his biggest regret
84:39 - um i forget what his was but one of the
84:41 - things that he had like these l's on is
84:43 - he's like he he started this company
84:45 - atrium took 75 million dollars and like
84:47 - lost all the money
84:50 - you know so like we hooked the video
84:52 - with that ryan carson when i interviewed
84:55 - him i asked him is one of his and like
84:57 - he passed up on 100 million dollar deal
84:59 - and he said no he turned it down and
85:01 - then he's like [ __ ] i should have said
85:02 - yes you know so like we started that one
85:04 - off like that
85:05 - um
85:06 - so in this one we didn't have any drama
85:08 - so we won't have like a crazy hook
85:10 - this one is more positive entertaining
85:12 - you know
85:13 - positive is good yeah we were pretty
85:15 - positive talk about krypto and stuff
85:17 - crypto's the future
85:20 - that's that's not a great hook
85:22 - it's also not it's also kind of a boring
85:24 - hook crypto's the future oh
85:27 - yeah should you start off with me going
85:29 - like
85:30 - patrick um
85:32 - why do all the crypto people dislike you
85:34 - and then
85:35 - answering it get get the get the
85:37 - controversy for the hook right there i'm
85:39 - with it
85:40 - why does the crypto community hate you
85:45 - yeah there you go
85:46 - [Laughter]
85:48 - yeah because if we say why does the
85:49 - crypto community love you that's not a
85:51 - fun that's something we should have a
85:52 - stream
85:53 - uh we should do a stream next time
85:55 - that's like um
85:56 - we're gonna keep streaming until patrick
85:58 - laughs at a blockchain meme
86:00 - and then it's just like we just keep it
86:02 - rolling and we just keep showing you
86:03 - random memes and then when you finally
86:05 - laugh we just end the stream oh i'm dude
86:08 - i'm game
86:10 - that's a that's a ridic all right yeah i
86:12 - can i can be stone face
86:14 - don't you're gonna be testing my stone
86:15 - face
86:17 - it's like nothing cracks you
86:19 - um
86:20 - all right we'll do something like that
86:21 - dude i'm excited i feel like a lot that
86:24 - we could [ __ ] do
86:26 - i love you bro so i'm gonna stop the
86:28 - recording guys thank you for watching i
86:30 - love your beautiful face um patrick
86:33 - should this subscribe what should they
86:34 - do right now yeah uh 100 go to my
86:37 - youtube channel subscribe
86:39 - uh patrick collins no just kidding like
86:41 - go learn blockchain go learn blockchain
86:43 - that's what you all should do y'all
86:44 - should go take a tutorial i'll give a
86:46 - [ __ ] what tutorial go do tutorial and
86:48 - then like exit tutorial hell go to a
86:51 - hackathon like make it make the
86:53 - commitment right now watching the stream
86:55 - with me and kazi like you're gonna go
86:57 - learn this [ __ ]
86:58 - dude qazi is doing a ton of videos like
87:00 - this is this is like if you're like oh
87:02 - like i wonder if this is your call to
87:04 - action like this is the [ __ ] universe
87:06 - saying hey like this is
87:08 - web three is what's up so so go learn
87:10 - blockchain free coke camp like uh causey
87:13 - uh eat the blocks that who cares like
87:16 - golem web 3 go to a hackathon come join
87:18 - us it's a ton of fun here yes sir there
87:21 - you go and smash the [ __ ] like button
87:23 - yeah more people
87:25 - match the [ __ ] yo subscribe to
87:26 - cleverprogrammer if you haven't already
87:28 - what the [ __ ] you doing here if you
87:29 - haven't subscribed already all right
87:31 - with that said guys we love your
87:32 - beautiful face if you watch it up until

87:54 - facing the merge i really be hating in
87:56 - the
87:56 - [Music]
87:59 - put mud

Cleaned transcript:

let's talk about the money dude if ethereum developer solidity developer they're coding for half a year one year how much money are they making high end is is nuts dude like 150 170 but dude dude i've seen i've seen [ __ ] for like 500 plus tokens would it do what it does but you being where you was but it ain't what it is facing the merger i really be hating in the mud said i can't pick it up but i did y'all know what's up guys how's it going this is qazi today we got the man in the house the man the myth the legend uh the solidity god oh solidity god that's my title i'm with it what's up quasi how are you man i'm here how are we doing let's go so i'm super excited to have patrick on today patrick if you don't know he just how i found him is he dropped this tutorial on youtube it hit 2 million views on free code camp yes sir and he's also a content creator he's a beast a super grounded guy as well and just really fun to talk to and uh today i pretty much want to talk with patrick about um web 3 crypto defy and um probably everything in between so patrick welcome on board brother hey kazia great to be here and and like we were chatting a little bit before we started filming but yeah your channel is fantastic i was telling them when we started filming i was like yo like when you go live you keep the energy up like that's what i'm about i'm about and yeah we uh we we had a what a zoom call maybe during like eat denver or something and it was so funny because uh there's there's a lot of people that i talked to very very serious very but like we just started ripping right away which was uh which was cool like yo what the [ __ ] okay how's it going yeah yeah you know we'll be [ __ ] crazy yeah we'll be crazy because even when i look at your channel it's fun to look at and most computers keep [ __ ] so boring um i mean not content creators let me not say content creators because they're going to come and shoot me yeah yeah but i think with a lot of developers i meet in the ecosystem they want to be like really professional and really serious yeah and um and i don't know like i'm just i'm very i'm very anticorporate you know we're we're like the peter mckinnons of the coding world i feel like dude i have i have empirical evidence that this style of education this style of like edutainment almost is is better so when i was first making videos i got a ton of people dming me i'm saying yo dude you need to like stop all that silly [ __ ] like just just just just get on the screen like code and like shut the hell up and i was like i was like i know for a fact like when i'm learning i'm like if that [ __ ] is like i'm falling asleep if that's just if that's how it is so so what i ended up doing is i i released two videos back to back exact same content it was about like um asynchronous programming in python um didn't it blast them out didn't do anything the one one of them i'm like crazy zany like over the top and the other one i'm like shut the [ __ ] up like all right here this is 20 times 20 times the views on the more animated one it's a factor of 20. it's 20 times more impactful to like do the style of content that you do um and that's the empirical level so yeah dude same page the higher and it's more fun yeah i mean i agree it's like p people want to be entertained right why are they on youtube like they can just be reading like an encyclopedia book on the technology you know like right they're they're here because most people want to be entertained like joe attack who's one of the creators i really i really love um he's doing some really unique [ __ ] now and i actually bought two of his uh oh the nfts that he dropped yeah yeah yeah this is not a condoning of buying that [ __ ] not financial advice yeah yeah yeah yeah go ahead i was gonna say jomatech is uh he's he's super entertaining right superintendent he's a little bit different than what like you and i do like you're like more like yo here's how you code this stuff with that higher energy he's he's a lot more or he's a lot more like entertaining stuff although i think he has done he's done a lot in the past he has okay he was selling like his own courses around algorithms um and now he launches nft and uh his main purpose banned at nft so the community essentially it's like crowd funding for him so the community can fund him so he can like keep creating videos and content um but yeah i think i think that's that's what it is you know i think i think that's like a million dude in like 10 minutes dude yeah he was like yeah we sold out right away which i i mean i'm pumped for him i think that that's fantastic right like i i think his style of content is really cool and um yeah however however he can monetize that great like that's a great use case for blockchain there you go right sliding right into the blockchain conversation that too yeah yeah yeah i mean it's pretty great i mean honestly though one thing i have been thinking about is i've been watching a lot of mr beast's [ __ ] dude content yeah i every single video he drops i watch are you serious okay so let me tell you dude i'm getting so [ __ ] excited like i'm actually thinking about dude i should be talking to you outside of this podcast dude [ __ ] brainstorming we need to be sinking because because i'm on the same like any time it's so like so uh so i work at chain like labs right and we have a bunch of da's right so we make we make content um we kind of change it it's a little bit different though but any single anytime someone's like yo what should i do for a video or for like presentation i always say like this is something mr b said once he was like don't give the audience time to ask am i bored right now yeah like don't let them don't let them be bored right because if they're bored that's when they that's when they bounce off and uh and like it it's it does a disservice to them like if you're being so boring that they leave like you're not getting them like especially for what we're doing we're not able to teach them as effectively dude so like every single every single mr beast video i'm like yo this is a this is a workshop on how to like make good content and i'm always trying we're on the same page although you've done a lot better than me i'm i'm always trying to tweak my [ __ ] to be more mr beastly but uh but basically yeah man so i think like mr b stuff uh so i'll tell you this i'm like actually studying at hardcore now like i'm okay studying it so what i mean by that is like his last video was like i built um uh it was um world's most dangerous escape room uh he he dropped one two days ago you're behind the scenes with sharks i don't know i watched that one too would you say okay okay i'm like i'm like that is genius i saw a title i'm like that's [ __ ] genius um and um yeah and then even like when i ran into him um and i asked him and he like looked at my phone and he told me my thumbnails were [ __ ] and i was like i was like all right keep working on it but like yeah his so the would you swim and then the world's most dangerous escape room so i started studying like the hook lasts from zero to seven seconds dude i oh like so the the the one um the one before he did the i'm getting chased by the military or something like that his hook was nine seconds and i was like oh my god he's making you shorter i literally same dude same page holy [ __ ] yep sorry keep going that's what i'm saying like [Laughter] like this year i'm really excited about working on some really big videos that get viral like they go viral in the tech space but people don't even need to understand it so like one of the ideas that i was having and i guess i'll just brainstorm some of it with you here because i was like one of the things i thought about is like turning it into a game show um like a game show for developers so no not many people like joe attack is doing the fictional side right like he's doing the side where um he has like these fictional videos or not fiction i don't know what the term is but it's like he's making up these short films and stories right i would want to do like um so i thought of the hook and my hook was like um i built the world's hardest javascript challenge and if this developer can solve it in one hour he wins ten thousand dollars oh wait that's super sick because when you s dude when you said game show i actually like a part of me was like like game show like there's somebody like hey welcome and they're like they're super boring but that but that hook right there that was sick that got me amp that got me excited oh that's sick that's that's me so i'm thinking about doing something like that where like we can get developers like so same on the next one you know what i'm saying so like hardest blockchain challenge and if this dude we have you fly in we have the challenges set up for you right and then once you do these 10 challenges yeah you win x prize but it's like they're obstacles in the way i don't know i just thought they got to like run laptop to laptop like solving like dude because that was the other thing i was like how do you make how do you make like the coding stuff entertaining like like so so we've done we've done um we've done speed coding for like chain link hackathons right where developer shows up they they like we we give them some random tasks and then whoever finishes it first wins those are exciting for me because i'm like you know i i see like all the different solidity techniques they're using and stuff and i'm like oh nice yeah but like but somebody who's maybe a little bit newer isn't going to really know what's or i i i like to think about like uh like league of legends for example if you don't play league of legends if you try to watch a league of legends it just looks like a cluster f bro it's it's so fun to watch even though i'm not i don't really really and i'm not good at all but i watched that [ __ ] bro i was on the twitch uh thing watching it yesterday i watched all the time i love chess i play competitive chess but like but it has nothing to do with league so i like sometimes watch chess streams but league i have no idea right and i'm watching league i went on twitch started watching league and it is so entertaining they'll be like oh my god oh my god he's patrick's in the middle lane and he's about to gank him and the dragon calls over all like oh [ __ ] look it's so i get hyped and i kind of get what's happening so i feel like league of legends gets a lot of viewership but i'll tell you why i think even if people don't really know it they can still watch it because they get people get killing they're like two people right right right they get money people are getting coins yep um people get the concept of like one person outsmarting the other so when you involve commentary i think the energy of the commentary makes it exciting but if you didn't have the commentary you'd be like what the hell am i watching yeah yeah oh that's so interesting because so i i played i have played way too much league of legends so when i watched league of legends the whole time i'm like oh [ __ ] like oh my god like i don't i don't need the commentary because i like see what's going on i mean i do appreciate the commentary but that's crazy i i never thought that people like who didn't know the game because like dude i i played a a way too much league i i've quit i i only play for one week i was gonna say this i don't really play league but some people from our team play league like programmer and so like tonight i told them guys let's link up and let's play oh my god no dude i i quit dude i was uh i i was bad that's like all i would do i would like i would finish work i would play league so i i've i've been quit i've been sober for quite some time um but but one week out of the year i'll play like i'll wake up gambler when you like play league dude turn into an awful human being i don't uh in the beginning i was an awful human being i'm a lot uh i like to think i'm a pretty nice player now even when people are being toxic but naughty no like there's um i one week out of the year i play i wake up at 8 a.m i go to bed at 8 a.m the next day i sleep for 16 hours and like when i'm awake all i'm doing is playing playing league and that's like that's like a vacation for me and then my girlfriend my girlfriend like looks at me sideways and goes really like this is what you want to do and i'm like yes yes yes dude i i come from like a gaming background so i i oh really yeah like so i used to do competitive gaming ever since i was like 11 or 12 years old like even younger than that i played rts games like command and conquer general zero hour warcraft frozen throne uh what years of war i was ranked number three in the world for a whole month what what mirror's edge i was ranked number one holy [ __ ] um oh yeah i played games like all the [ __ ] time dude it was like i was playing 17 hours a day 18 hours a day when i was younger apparently sleeping my best best best summer ever was me and my best friend he would just come over all the time and we would play borderlands just grind berlin really yeah so you're kind of like the same thing that i did except for you're doing a lot better you took all that that energy that like oh yo i'm gonna play until like i can't like keep my eyes open anymore and then just put it into like youtube and coding and all that stuff that's yeah that's what i did coding became like the thing coding like literally felt like it was a video game and then people paid me and i was like this is [ __ ] stupid like don't be painful dude i feel that that's how that's how it feels my brother just started coding he's like uh he has like an exercise science background and he just started coding he was like yo this is like lowkey kind of fun and i was like that's what i'm saying just like getting over that like hump to like figure it out and then you have like all this creativity and you do all this crazy crazy [ __ ] and then you can do yeah weird tutorials like what like i'm gonna create uber on the blockchain or or whatever your last video was yeah dude like agreed same page same exact page yeah now we're now we're definitely doing now where it's like okay let's start building crazy [ __ ] that people like yeah um but but definitely the side that i want to explore so i'm like kind of giving myself a goal and this is a crazy goal like there's probably three percent chance of me succeeding in it but the goal is so it took us five years to get to one million subs but this year my goal is to get to 2 million subs you're uh you're preaching that goal out in public huh yeah okay only nine months left um so there's not much time left and so basically i have to be hitting like 100 000 subs per month or more you're at 1.1 right now though oh and you started doing more shorts too yeah i did mix it in i'm with it a little i did the garyvee one people liked it oh [ __ ] you got garyvee in here too i got no no fake i i i did a garyvee pair oh oh yeah tick tock yeah yeah i was like my apple is slow as [ __ ] i want my users to be patient oh man oh i love garyvee oh that's too funny like people i got tons of positive feedback on that so like i'm like trying to so what i'm trying to do is uh i'm gonna start doing lots of shorts and reels just because it it's very quick to produce something yeah yeah yeah i'm getting lots of positive feedback then i think i'm gonna turn it into longer form that's like imagine a youtube just like if gary v uh tried coding for one day and it's just a parody you know right but like then the question that becomes does that style does that if you like using the shorter ones it's like a signal it's like an indicator right maybe that style of content only works for the shorts yeah it's possible but like there's a captain sinbad who did like uh watches grant cardone once or watches garyvee once and then he like turns into grant cardone or whatever and that's like almost 2 million views yeah joe attacks because like what i realize is stuff with parodies and things that are funny or interesting really entertaining people watch it and so it has high watch time and then youtube just keeps recommending the [ __ ] out of it like crazy you know like mr b says shoot for on your okay let me ask you this on your youtube do you know what's your average retention like average percentage watched on like some of your recent videos uh i haven't been uh i'm i haven't been grinding the youtube stats that's nearly as much as you all have yeah i have no idea no idea i'll tell you with tutorials and [ __ ] it's like 10 or lower is what i've realized um it's pretty low uh my long tutorials are one percent two percent um and some of my best my best videos like with two million views are 35 percent watched yeah like top five programming languages to learn in 2021 or whatever or 2020 that got like 2 million views 38 watched uh mr beast he's like uh he his he says he tries to never drop anything that will hit below 70 retention what and we're we're hitting like between i'm probably hitting between one and ten you're hitting between 10 and 35. it's [ __ ] crazy dude that's that's that sounds like mr beast so the hard thing that i i have like trying to figure out though is because most of the stuff that i'm trying to do i'm trying to like okay and then maybe this yeah like because because my my whole thing like everything that i'm like doing in my life right now is like all right how do i get how do i figure out how to like share this amazing technology and like get coders as excited as me uh and like and like teach it right because there's so like few good really solid like people who like really understand solidity really understand smart contracts and so i'm like i'm like always feeling like okay i gotta like i gotta i gotta show them how to do this new code thing but like maybe the strat is what you're saying like mix in more like which i have been um but it's like it's not my focus as much i don't know what are your thoughts there i i'm torn i'm i'm in i've been torn for the last half a decade five years i've been doing this and i've been like do i go more entertainment and like mass and viral do i focus more on like niching down and staying focused on this and i'm like if i don't teach this then who am i like weird [ __ ] like that but then i was like thinking about it and i'm like it's like a youtube existential crisis almost yeah yeah yeah who am i yeah who am i [Laughter] i'm nobody i thought about it i'm like okay yeah that's true that if i don't do this you know it changes kind of my niche and it can be scary for the youtube algorithm things like that but then i thought about like what's my goal my goal is to get as many people into the world of coding as possible like whether it's web 3 or web 2 i don't care like as long as people can get into coding and so i feel like if if i have videos that get massive like millions of viewers entered that's like yeah thinking like you're okay let me tell it to you like this when you were young and you had you had that like cool [ __ ] professor just because a professor was cool and you [ __ ] with a professor you wanted to become what whatever he or she did yeah you make a good point yeah um rappers move entire industries and like create new genres just because like they are like what they're dropping lots of people [ __ ] with it and then they want to like be what they are or follow their path or their journey and so i'm like if i go mass appeal people will still come and watch my tutorials i think that makes a lot of sense bro i need more time in the day [ __ ] me um plus it's just interesting like creatively challenging like it's uh more than yeah yeah yeah above anything it's just like when i look at your content and you're doing you're pushing yourself creatively more than anything for me it's just like a really interesting creative challenge that's a really interesting way to look at it like how do i oh that's really interesting right could the how do i how do i get people excited about this thing um while also making sure to deliver like the impactful content and then how creative can i be to hit both of those goals yeah um yeah dude no that makes a lot of sense yeah so yeah i mean those were just a couple of things that i thought about um but yeah other than that i think overall our focus is how you know let's let's teach people about blockchain let's teach people about yeah um crypto more let's teach people about web three more so that's what we've been focusing on now which is which is phenomenal right the more people who can understand this technology the better um we are like people keep saying like we're early but like the thing is i feel like they don't really realize like how early we are like like because if you if you think about it like they're still like what what is the market cap of like hedge funds like several 100 trillion dollars right like or or something like that we could probably google it it's like it's some insane number right encrypt all of crypto combined is like what like 2 trillion or something like that like we're this tiny fragment of like like this whole old centralized way of doing things and we there's just like so so so like any and what i'm trying to say is see what you're saying thank you for your blockchain work and uh excited to keep bringing people in because yeah like we have this this um this issue of like okay like do we trust all these institutions that have like just continued to [ __ ] people in the past yeah i mean we can but we have a technology that makes it so we don't have to so why don't we just use that like one of the things that i thought about and and tell me kind of where your thoughts are on this but i think i spoke about this a little bit over the phone but we can go more on this so like one of the times you know people there are a lot of hot buzzwords in the blockchain we're like decentralized and a bunch of other things which if you don't really know what it means it just sounds like buzzwords but kind of one of the times it hit me is um when i saw kind of what was happening in russia recently where the ruble was dropping like crazy and these people were going and they're like yo the ruble values dropping like crazy we need to go and exchange this for something else and when they went to exchange it like they had just blocked off the exchanges basically just told them like no you can't exchange it and so basically i kind of realized like oh [ __ ] that's the dangerous part about having centralized exchanges and centralized control whereas if they had their money in crypto like let's just say it was like crypto rubles you know the usdc equivalent of rubles um they could just like liquidate and go into any other token or any other thing and do that instantly and nobody could stop them in the world yeah it's it's like one of these just crazy superpowers that crypto gives us right it's this thing where it says hey like there are people who want to screw you over and um it's it's it's so tricky because right like the winners write history right so like who is right is usually by you know but there's a good chance that you know there have the the people who should have won were on the losing side and they got screwed over and uh technology like this would have would have saved that so but yeah no you're spot on man like uh decentralized exchanges i feel like are one of these things that like we've solved and it's it's crazy to me like that um that well it's not craziness there's this learning gap that we need to get over but it's crazy to me that we're not all like holy [ __ ] how do we get this like faster and i know there's a ton of people excited about it and i know there's a ton of incumbents who are less excited about it but um yeah now we're now we're like you you're going to get me ranting here quasi if you don't cut me off it's perfect it's it's great i i do i think ranting on this is great because it's something important for people to hear right so like for example um something else that i've been super excited about is recently i started working with like web 3 companies and they have been paying in like crypto and uh and it's like three minutes or two minutes and you you get paid and i'm like what is this this is so weird this is so crazy and so it kind of hit me i'm like it's like now the money is not this like traditional ancient bank money where like your money's sleeping on a saturday and a sunday like what the [ __ ] like how does that make any sense first of all like if money is the most important thing just have somebody on the saturday and sunday shift so they're running the money stuff like i don't get it right but then like with crypto you could send it 24 7. you get everybody gets within a couple of minutes which is huge um some examples even some of my own team members are like when they get paid because if sometimes if it takes five days or seven days for them to get paid they have to they pay their they end up paying their rent late which means they start getting all these fees but if my team was getting paid in crypto they would get their money right away right and there's no stopping it but one fear i will tell you is love it was [ __ ] weird for me to get paid encrypted dude i was like scared i was like they're gonna be just paying me in this like metamask wallet that i have and it's like it's just a it's a chrome [ __ ] extension that i'm depending my whole life on you know what i mean and i'm like yeah it's so shaky and flaky and it could just die what if i forget the mnemonic password like how would i log into my phone to get this money um you know and then i had to learn about noncustodial wallets and they're like it's if it's a noncustodial wallet no wait wait wait let me let me jump in there like [ __ ] that like take that term out of your dictionary okay that is that is some marketing [ __ ] to like say like oh like noncustodial wallets are like worse or like no there's there's it's not noncustodial wallets it's just your [ __ ] wallets you got the private key it's your it's your token right like because what are they saying like custodial wallets are like [ __ ] that's kyc'd [ __ ] that like that is some marketing [ __ ] uh don't let don't don't uh this this is my like this is me speaking from within now don't [ __ ] say that [ __ ] anymore not custodial wallets that it's it's like the the reason the reason that the reason i think that that terminology came about was there was this huge push you know from governments they wanted kyc all that [ __ ] so they started saying like noncustodial wallets as if like that's the worst one is if custodial is like the norm so which is which is a bunch of [ __ ] totally antithesis of what blockchain is yeah um but yeah and and then there's stuff like that happen so this is the perfect there's stuff like that happening where it's like oh like i gotta learn about noncustodial versus custodial like [ __ ] that [ __ ] like but but agree there's there's a lot of like user experience stuff that needs to improve right like the fact that you're like if i forget my private key i'm screwed yeah i do think there are a lot of people where like a service like some type of managed service even though again that's the antithesis of blockchain might be helpful for um yeah i think i think multisigs are a good approach there because uh if you forget and you have like two really close people to you who are on the multisig then great like it's okay um but yeah i agree there's definitely still like a curve um to make it easier for the masses what i could do is like i could have two of my brothers put in their passwords right and then like if i ever need to access it worst case scenario and everything both of my brothers can put it in and yeah or like or like a recovery wallet basically yeah you say hey like i i can do keys these are like the cool thing about smart contracts is you can code it to do whatever you want to do so um yeah you can do stuff like that but but agreed it's like there is this like um kind of like you know even i've done it a ton now sometimes when i send crypto i'm still like okay like hopefully i sent it to the right address yeah that's what i did like that that whole thing would like hopefully send it to the right address like i really wish that better solutions around that because that's like a really weird one it's like because currently with the way that i send money like going into the web 2 world i feel really secure i know 99 of the times like you know uh when i'm sending it it's gonna get sent there when i pop in my brother like let's say if it's paypal um i'm sending it to his email address it auto completes his email address his photo shows up like i'm sure it's the same dude well so the thing is like stuff like that like can be built and it's like yeah i mean like one of the uh the steps in that direction is we have e s now ethereum name service and like if i'm if i want someone to send me eth i say hey like patrick alpha c dot eth right and so boom you can just send it to like my domain almost which i think is like it's a much easier like much more friendly approach uh to sending stuff so i i think we're getting there yeah um but we'll we'll need more and again like the crazy thing is like what ethereum came out in 2015 2014 2016 one of those days and yeah in the grand scheme of things it's like this is new this is really yeah i mean bitcoin was um wow i'm forgetting on my dates now 2009 something yeah i think so 2011 to the 2009 was bitcoin 2009. okay all right i got it all right we're we're good um yeah created let's see 2015 i think they announced 2014 or something but i mean dates or whatever um uhhuh but yeah we're getting there we're getting the kazi there there's a lot of stuff to do and uh and that's why i'm so early we're early and i'm so on the [ __ ] train of like teaching people how to build this crazy [ __ ] because yeah like we can move towards this world where you can kind of like do [ __ ] you can like just have access to the markets to me that's like like wherever you are it doesn't matter like you can you can be a part of like financing be like an accredited investor to invest oh my god dude yeah like right yep you have to be yeah it just means like we're gonna allow rich people to get richer most of the time yep when a company is ipo'ing or whatever yeah they they get to get in at the best pricing the credit investor is like all right if you're already filthy rich and you want to get richer if you're filthy rich get in for cheaper and if you don't have money you have to pay 50 times that [ __ ] it's i i understand what the idea is it's like oh well if you if you're not a credit investor maybe you're this is gonna sound crazy maybe you're you don't have the experience uh that's a better way of saying it maybe you don't have the experience to do that but to me like pardon me is like it's like oh like they're they're thinking i'm too [ __ ] stupid to like to invest in this thing come on like it's like let me yeah like the government shouldn't i feel like a government shouldn't be allowed to make that decision for you like they allow gambling you know whatever dude allow all this [ __ ] like how are you deciding this is the thing that like i don't get to invest into a company but i can go and gamble yes dude i i think about this all the time because i'm like yo like so i worked at a hedge fund for a couple years and i was like what's yeah dude i worked at hedge fund for a couple years crazy excuse me an asset manager asset manager okay but like this is the same thing because yeah you i feel like you know so much about like crypto or like just the money stuff yeah yeah well it was crazy because i like uh i joined the the company because i wanted to learn it you know more about coding i was new in my career and i was fascinated about like how big money works and i was like well i want to learn how that how how does the world work basically in like another in another sense and then i'm like all right what's the secret sauce and like you know it the my takeaway from like and i read a ton of books and like i worked here and i talked to all these people who worked at like different groups my takeaway was that they're basically like running a ton a ton of software to guess what is going to go up and guess what is going to go down and that's it and i'm like that's the same thing if i go to [ __ ] casino and i go roll a roulette ball and i'm guessing it's going to be black or white and like i'm like it's it's like gambling with like way more steps and now that isn't totally fair that isn't totally fair um it's definitely not totally fair and um i think there are a lot of financial institutions that do do right and that do do good things so i i don't wanna i wanna just do i knew this was a good good uh good call to get on room temperature iq's over here excellent dude i'm back i'm back in fifth grade this is great um talking about like big money hedge funds and [ __ ] um but uh but yeah so so some of them like do do what [ __ ] um they do they do like uh actually like help the investors and and and help them like get into uh places to save their money to save their value right because in my mind that's what investing is it's like save your value um but there's there's a lot of them that what their goal is is it's you know it's a zerosum game if you're winning somebody else is losing figure out any little way to like screw somebody else over and it's it's just guessing right and it's yeah that's one thing that's that's really frustrating is that there's um there's yeah like you said there's a lot of people who are allowed to play this guessing game to play this gambling game and there's a lot of people that aren't and it's it's it's really frustrating so but but i again i want to make it perfectly clear that i'm not [ __ ] on the entire uh financial industry but i am [ __ ] on some of them to be to be quite frank because yeah it's it's um a ton of them they're just like they're they're get they get paid a [ __ ] ton of money to guess with a ton with a ton of charts and [ __ ] and they're just guessing i feel like i mean another thing as you were talking i started thinking about and i'm like what another thing that web 3 and this blockchain world is allowing us to do is um you know first of all you don't need you know so just in layman's terms if we could just bring it down so yeah what this basically means is let's say a company like tesla if it was in the traditional world you can't you weren't as a normal person you the viewers watching it who's probably not an accredited investor if you are that's [ __ ] great but like if you're not um probably what happened is when when tesla like you know was private company or whatever you couldn't invest in it but the cofounder of like twit uh or not twitch but like companies like twitter or whatever probably could yeah don't don't [ __ ] on him like that you just had him on your uh he's a great he's a great dude like he's getting i don't know he's companies because he's rich as [ __ ] and i'm not yeah but like but yeah it's uh yeah just like they could all get in early but like you can't get in early but if it was in the web 3 or blockchain world it's very likely that if like tesla launched they would have a tesla token that goes alongside it and from day one you could have been like an investor if you believed in it yeah no quasi to me the the biggest thing here like like because even in crypto like those guessing excuse me those guessing games are going to happen those groups that are just playing you know which which is fine because again i think there are a lot of them that do um do well do do right by investors they're really trying to get a return and like save people's value and i and i do think a lot of these financial products are really important yeah however to me the bigger thing the crazy thing is um information asymmetry and to me that is like one of these things that blockchain really just like nails in like elaine what do you mean by that yeah yeah so um so have you heard of flash boys before nope okay cool so back in the early 2000s right there was kind of the or maybe late 90s i forget the actual date but uh there were a lot of these high frequency trading firms popping up right and um they made a movie about this i think it's called like butterfly or something like that um where basically they like uh what was happening was whoever's server was closer to like the nasdaq or like the different exchanges could like send trades quicker and screw other people over so they would like see somebody somebody's about to make a trade right and basically front run them right so okay you're about to buy a bunch of bunch of this thing okay i'm gonna buy it first sell it back to you um and just like all this this kind of again because it's a zerosum game everyone's looking for like the edge the thing to like [ __ ] over the other person and um what it ended up doing was it just like everyone's getting wrecked by these people who are just have this new technology because they have this information they serve industry they're closer to the to the servers they have uh they're faster whatever and it kind of it it doesn't really make for like a fair market like how is it fair that because your computer is like a foot closer to where they run the transactions that you're getting better deals like that's not fair at all that's ridiculous right yeah um and there's there's stuff like this that happens all the time and um and even more so uh like when people make deals or when people i would okay so i will i would kind of play the devil's advocate and also go please yeah yeah go for it i would also go nothing is fair like that's how people find their edge in business and things because they find the unfair thing or whatever that gives them that edge not an unethical way but maybe that's so it's like why don't you just find a way to get closer to the data center maybe that's the thing to thought about you know that maybe a lot of people didn't think about but we keep going i'm listening no it's that that's a great point i mean uh the counter argument then it's like okay well not everybody can be closest there can only be one closest um but that's true but then the but then the other thing to think about is okay well imagine this imagine two systems one where there's a one in one million chance of you being the closest one to the server versus a system where there's perfect information and everyone can see everything that's true which which one are you gonna pick well there's a one in one million chance of you like being in the close of one so why the [ __ ] would you not pick this one in this one's blockchain yeah um so so there's uh although like there there is still front running and all this crazy an mev and all the [ __ ] that happened to blockchain but the thing i like is that all the information is perfect right there's you you know immediately who screwed you you know what's going on and it's much easier to say okay cool well i'm just gonna do what you just did right versus like in in the traditional world that everything happens behind closed doors or like if a company is going to do um some crazy thing or they're they're they're leeching money or they're you know the protocol is you know they're going bankrupt or something everything all of that is available on chain there's no like there's no like oh like this person knows like how much money the protocol has made you can see on chain how much money the protocol or excuse me the company right you can see all this information and i think that that's crazy the transparency is crazy crazy it's dude it's like it's crazy powerful and then additionally the biggest thing the thing that i usually rants about is this uh this trust minimization there's just fewer entities you have to trust because the code just does its thing right you say hey like jump it it jumps right it uh you say hey like send money it sends money there's no where does trust minimization come into play yeah so uh all over the place um uh one of my favorite examples that i give because it's like it's pretty easy for people to understand it uh have you heard of the mcmillion scandal uh this is the mcdonald's one that i think you've told me about right yes oh did i tell you about this yeah yeah yeah so i'll add it on here okay yeah so mcdonald's they ran this promotion where they were basically like yo buyer mcnuggets and we'll you know play our like monopoly game will give you a chance to win a million dollars that sounds great so a ton of people they said okay cool i'm gonna go buy mcdonald's because i want to win this lottery right yeah in doing so who were they trusting mcdonald's they were trusting mcdonald's they were trusting to mcdonald's to actually give them a fair chance of winning and for years between like 13 and 24 million dollars uh went to like some crime syndicate and you had a zero percent chance of winning right so you were trusting this entity where there was all this like you know behind closed doors like the lottery winners are getting picked behind closed doors so you were just assuming you were trusting they wouldn't do the right thing now you have this system where you're trusting mcdonald's to do the right thing versus on the blockchain you have a system where you can see everything that happens yeah and you can see exactly how the random candidates are chosen yeah like why would you why would you why would you ever use this world why would you ever use so there's this trust minimization or yeah and and i think like just so to to put like a little asterisk it might not have been mcdonald's fault they hired like you know but they were still they were still the one saying hey trust us we promise we'll give you a fair chance yeah right so like we trusted them but they kept picking like one group instead of giving people an equal chance but if it was done with a smart contract on the blockchain there would literally for developers on here it would literally be like an array and it would be like your array of the people which is everybody that's in the competition so it could be a thousand people or a hundred thousand million people and it'd be like random or whatever right in python you have the i forget but there's like you can import and select from the range and so it's like you just select random person you could see that code and that's the code that would pick and choose so the trust minimization that patrick is talking about i think here is like that you're talking about is you don't have to trust mcdonald's you you just see the code dude you got it i mean if you can see the code then you know and and that code would be publicly available to everybody that's participating in this challenge yeah in in solidity or viper whatever um because blockchains are deterministic there's actually no like dot random you can do pseudorandom which obviously isn't great um but you can use a chain like vrf which is a verifiably random function and that'll give you like a provably random number which is kind of mindblowing that you can have a number that's like provably random um it's a cryptographically random yeah it's it's a little too big brain for me yeah i don't even think i understand how random works like i don't even understand how random works and like there are certain things that like really blow my [ __ ] mind right it's like how do you write an equation that goes one way and not the other like that always just like hurts so hard it's like you can go one like usually the formula to reverse engineer backwards is like if you wrote the equation how can it be that hard dude math is math is great and then or basically maybe the idea is you know what the equation is but in order to like go through the steps of that equation it's just so computationally challenging that we don't solve it in time that's idea right and then uh for for viewers watching uh he's he's referring to like hashes or private public key uh cryptography which what he just said is literally like the basis of all of cryptography like oh these algorithms are one way you can't go you can yeah yeah they're they're one way so basically you can go the other way but it just takes really long that's the idea right i i mean it's like is it impossible to go the other way well so think of it this way if you if you have um like a number that's 10 to the if i'm thinking of a number between 0 and 2 raised to the 220 256th value which is like an insanely huge number um guess which number i'm thinking of that's kind of the uh that's kind of how it works like or or bigger or what so is it impossible it's like really just it's just it's like it's trial and error it's just trial and error like you just keep guessing until you get it which technically isn't impossible but like what super it takes super computers we were like hundreds of thousands future we might have computers that could probably brute force it or or if you waited or if you had one computer today then ran it for like a million years maybe it would get one so that you know if you want us if you want to steal someone's crypto that's the advice like imagine i was doing a short or like a video on this like like a parody like one minute thing like the crypt the the guy who hacked crypto or like broke the algorithm and it's like he like survives the [ __ ] ice age the he survives all of that and it like breaks into a wallet and it only has one dollar in it and then [Laughter] well he he should have checked either scan that was that was his first mistake yeah so okay but i i do want to give a quick second example uh because now you got me got me going uh because the the mcdonald's one is kind of like fun or whatever um but a a better a more impactful example that i'd like to give is transition or what trust minimization yeah a ton of people got screwed by robin hood right robin hood said nope can't buy these anymore what's up like where they're like you can't buy game stop stocks anymore can't buy gamestop stuff anymore or the other example i like to give is the 2008 financial crisis but that might be a longer story um but with gamestop they said you can't buy these anymore um you know and they even sold some for some people and whether or not it was their fault it doesn't really matter they had the ability they centralized ability to say nope we're flipping the switch you can't do this anymore even though they made this promise hey come use our platform we are democratizing finance like that was the promise that they made the end that they ultimately broke so and the uh the joke that was going around the crypto community was um there was somebody they posted like a picture of like a transaction on ether scan saying oh sorry um we've we've rejected your transaction because we have the power to do so and like the joke was like you can't because the code is immutable so uh yeah i mean that's yeah so that's a powerful example of it you know where like if you're on um if you're doing something on uniswap for example you can never get stopped it's it's in as long as computers exist and networks exist and like literally it can't be stopped there's no one entity that can like cops or the fed can't come in and be like hey shut this down it's that's like another interesting thing because there was um i was listening to a podcast on bankless banquets is a really sick podcast oh yeah i listened to a little bit of it oh yeah kevin rose did the one with bankless and i listened to that oh yeah oh hell yeah yeah they're they're great they're like um they're like the bro yes finance people um no they're they're good though they're they're they're good um yeah but uh they were talking with one of these guys who was down like in washington and they were talking about like yeah like some guy was like well if we really wanted to we would go around and we would track all the nodes down and take them down and i was like could you do that or or something along those lines and i was like like how would you track down kind of like how they caught the the people who stole 50 billion worth of bitcoin or something right the couple they like tracked all the nodes oh yeah well no that was that was different they just uh they did a poor job hiding their transactions uh like because again everything is transparent you know if you make transactions on chat you think if they came to you and you somebody who has all this knowledge and like you could like do you think you could help them get away with it because you're setting me up to get some pretty shady dms here to be honest maybe um but i mean there's there's also you know there's so much in this like i like to think i know a lot of stuff there's so many people who know way more than me right so maybe there's some weird back door i didn't think about that you know it would destroy me but i would definitely probably be able to to help but i wouldn't um that's the thing i'm too busy i'm i'm i'm trying to release the next free code camp video dude i don't have time to [ __ ] help your shady [ __ ] yeah not not you kazee whoever whoever's yeah yeah damn yeah i mean it's it's so well i'm sorry what were you saying though because i think you were talking about like reverse engineering nodes or something and i had oh yeah yeah they were i forgot what it was and and uh i feel like i'm just gonna say something stupid because i don't remember it somebody they were saying like oh like we would hunt down whoever deployed the contract or like we would hunt down like then yeah i'm back now i got to rewatch that episode to remember but i was like i was like that sounds ridiculous i don't know if that would be and by i don't know i mean like there's no way like like they haven't even cracked the onion network like how are you gonna what's on your network or excuse me like tour um excuse me like uh like like tour like the encrypted um encrypted torrent or something no so tor is like uh i forget what it stands for like the onion router or something like that um it's like a it's basically like an anonymous uh way to surf the internet like when you make a request to a website it kind of like scrambles it with other like computers so it's hard to see like where you're coming from oh i think i think it does i think it does some other stuff too i'm i'm definitely like not painting in its best light incognito i forget uh i know i know a lot about blockchain the networking stuff kind of yeah okay word perfect yeah get get him on the next podcast and we'll talk to her got it so like yeah yeah we'll bring him on hey break it break down the tour part he just comes in [Laughter] so so i think like okay so i understand there there's some parts about decentralization there's part about some trust minimization but like okay let's talk about like the uh i guess maybe a couple of things we can touch on and if you ever have to go just let me know i don't know dude i'm in i'm enjoying the conversation causing yeah my uh i blocked off the rest of the today to code so it's all good for me that is nice great way to do it dude because like otherwise you just like i miss coding and i don't get to code oh that's exciting it kind of makes me want to do well i was thinking of like like streaming my coding but then i'm like like i've done it before and i'm like just so much less productive because i'm like talking mom cody yeah yeah it's kind of like chess and i'm streaming chess like i play much worse man yeah there yep yeah exactly so but yeah dude if you get a chance to block off some time for coding it's like it's great it's like my favorite part of the day dude that is cool that is exciting um if i did blockchain coding i would jump in like if i did like full on maybe your skill level blockchain coding skills i would jump in with you but i'll i'll help you dude you need full stack in the same we could be in the same visual studio code on collab dude bro wait how sick if i'm like if i'm like writing all the back end [ __ ] and you're doing yo that would be sick actually that might be hella fun that would be a lot of fun how quickly can we build like a like a simple like nft marketplace or some [ __ ] you haven't i think you've already done that it's like some some weird [ __ ] like i'm like yeah that would be pretty cool our video would be a lot of fun because we could have like i could have somebody edit it and they could it would be more based on storytelling rather than like a tutorial um um one other thing is like yeah so if we did something like that or like we did uh i don't know simple blockchain challenges against each other and then see like and time each other you know yeah i did a video like that with a friend and we we battled each other with css so we got css challenge and then yeah we did it and then um i ended up winning so it's like entertaining video but now if i did it i have a lot of mr beast ideas in my head so i'm like it's like instead of one challenge taking 27 minutes his challenges each take like 50 seconds 40 seconds right in one video i would just like we you and i would just do 10 blockchain challenges you know or better yet i have somebody who i can pit against you oh [ __ ] so like you guys do the [ __ ] blockchain challenge i become the game show host and whoever wins gets like ten thousand dollars yo all right i'm in i'm in wait wait i know i know some coders too like uh yeah i know some people who could do it like this is my brother he's you know he's been coding for a week him and i we're great competition uh i'll blow him away and win the ten thousand dollars every single time so that sounds good to me yeah there you go okay but actually yeah no i and uh yeah i i know some people who would be who probably would would destroy me too um dude that sounds like a ton of fun yeah experience you have with blockchain i've been coding uh like solidity stuff for like the past two and a half years at this point wow which what the thing is like senior senior little dude because like people are starting a month ago dude which is so funny to think about yeah because like uh we you talk to like like a react developer right or like a uh or maybe not react it's the best example because they're kind of a javascript developer and i say like oh two and a half years they're like yeah i've been coding javascript for [ __ ] 20. right it's uh totally different yeah like i mean because the max you can be is like five years really six years let's talk about the money dude if ethereum developer solidity developer they're coding for half a year one year how much money are they making on like if they're if they're like um let's say they're in us let's just start there they're in u.s they know what they're doing they've been doing it for half a year a year like what type of salary range are we talking yeah it's it definitely ranges um if you're like super noob stuff it can still be kind of like a normal like developer like it could be like 80 90k like if you're we're talking about like pretty much junior level people yeah we're talking about junior level people i mean and the the thing is most projects aren't looking for junior level people um because senior well because it's just um like most products like need to move quick and they're like building quick uh but the good thing is like the i think the startups that are like a little bit more openminded realize that okay like if we get a bunch of junior developers they probably can still build something really sick right like most junior solidity developers are learning crazy [ __ ] fast yeah and are gonna be learning on the fly and building really cool [ __ ] so yeah like like low end i'm gonna say it's like 80 to 90. high end is is is nuts dude high end high ends i wouldn't be surprised if the average is like like 150 170. uh i think i think crypto jobs list quoted it a lot lower though i think like a couple of like here's what people are making quoted at like 120 130. but dude dude i've seen i've seen [ __ ] for like 500 plus tokens yeah like um i don't i don't know how legit those are yeah um and i don't i don't personally know anybody who's doing that i've seen [ __ ] like that but yeah i do know people who are doing 180 plus tokens 200 plus tokens you know um so that's that's pretty like within the realm of doable okay i don't know what 100 200 tokens means what what sorry like like how like i thought we were talking about usd like people make hundred fifty thousand oh no no sorry like like 200k 200k plus tokens like 200k plus like the equivalent of the stock options and got i got it okay yeah which which and i say like plus tokens because if the the project sucks like it tanks and it's like all right well i got nothing for these tokens these tokens project is good like um i don't know if you know alex becker and the crypto community is huge oh well now i feel silly i don't know alex becker alex how do you spell his last name um alex becker so alex and then becker okay so he's more like uh influencer slash somebody who talks a lot about crypto uh oh [ __ ] 800 000 followers okay yeah on youtube he's he should be past a million subs now really yeah and like each video he was dropping on crypto dude was doing like half a million views and you could do those styles really yeah um but like yeah he just talks about crypto stuff and he launched his own nft project have you ever heard of neo tokyo i'm not so anyways like his developer that got on it it now makes like has made over seven figures like in less than a year wow yeah so i feel like some some projects if you get on that are like good projects i mean it's kind of [ __ ] nuts you know my friend just like minted uh neo tokyo and it's uh and if he sells it today it's worth quarter million and he got it for free that's that's one of the things that like is really exciting and it's good about this space that there's like so much there's a lot of economic opportunity here and people like it hyped and like yo i'm trying to make bank yeah it also is like it also has a downside where you have all these you you you get a ton of people who come in and they go yo i'm gonna join this project early because and i want to be like you know what this alex becker guy did and they just get [ __ ] wrecked and that that always breaks my heart or like the thing that happens all the time is like a new protocol launches and somebody goes oh my god like i'm gonna be the first one on this protocol like i'm gonna get all these rewards it's gonna be great and they just get [ __ ] rugged yeah um so it comes with a downside and the other downside is that likes a lot of people view the industry as like this stupid cash grab yeah which to a lot of people it is and and and if that's if that's what gets you into the space you know so be it um i mean i'm not going to lie dude we talked about this right i get it when i'm like monkeys and making this much money i'm like let me start paying attention to this but then like i came for the monkeys and i stayed for the decentralization bro dude for for me it was the uh it was a combination of the memes the promise and the money it was like all three like like to me like the the memes in the space are hilarious the fact that like like a super super [ __ ] serious event the the mascot is a half buffalo half [ __ ] unicorn half like pigeon right to me that is phenom and that's that's eat denver one to me that's phenomenal like you have this ridiculous yeah which you should have came dude next time next time i was too late yeah next next year next year next year yeah eat denver's super sick but uh yeah like we like it's it's this crazy weird i forget where i was going with this crazy weird community but yeah like it's i got into it for the money for the for the uh for the decentrality and for the memes and yeah now that i'm here i'm like holy [ __ ] [ __ ] uh yeah there's well actually that's not even true because uh it was it was even more for the um the future because i was like i was researching smart contracts and i was like holy [ __ ] like all these [ __ ] issues in finance that i saw i'm like holy [ __ ] like this is the answer this is the [ __ ] answer so yeah so i i i i it caught my attention because of all that [ __ ] but yeah i was like holy [ __ ] [ __ ] because of all like the cool stuff that this technology enables so i mean yeah i i totally agree with that like it enables so many cool things i think like you know one of the things that i'm thinking about is how do you see average users getting into this space right so for example some thoughts at the top of my head are like you know um things like solana pay that just releases pay you can actually go to a real store flip out your phone and like just pay what's a lot of pay right so that makes it look kind of real world how do you see it becoming a more no not just for in people looking to make a quick buck on nfts but more people switching into it yeah i i think one of the biggest steps i i think the first big pillar to fall is gonna be well it's already falling it's gonna be defy right like all these um investing asymmetries and this unfairness like all there's so many advantages that d5 gives like the common person that i think like that is the the entry point that's going to be the first thing i think that's going to be the first thing to go mainstream some could argue that nfts have gone mainstream but i i don't i i think nfts are great but like the val the real value i feel like is um for like for like making people's wellbeing better is more in defy um i think nfcs are really cool i think they're fantastic um but yeah i think like the the normal person who wants to have a better life it's d5 right because they can invest in all these these really cool uh financial products they can invest much easier yeah um and they can kind of they can have access to this financial world they weren't able to have access before um one of the things i really did like about robinhood was they were originally their mission was that as well and i i think it still is but they [ __ ] up a little bit um so like give people access to to easily like be a part of markets and i think crypto is really the fulfillment of that vision uh with like a provably fair done in approvally fair way so i think d5 i think like a lot of the investing um like moving away from kind of traditional stocks to to crypto stuff i think that's kind of the first foray um and that's one of the first things for for i mean once money moves there pretty much everything that's gonna then fall like a domino effect right that's that's actually kind of a big big thing i think so yeah why what do you think um i man i don't know like honestly it's definitely a tough one to kind of predict like i i get certain ideas around nfts and i'm like oh just like for example uh if you get nnft to gary v's fly fish club or whatever he launched you could then now they're launching the service where you could lease it out to other people so you could own it but you could lease it out to other people or let them rent and i'm like that's such a cool concept because imagine if for three months i'm like you know what i'm really not using my netflix subscription but instead of canceling it what if i could let somebody borrow it for three months i don't know like that would be pretty cool um the thing that i do causey is anytime like one of my buddies is like yo like how do i how do i crypto i go okay get a mask wallet i'll send you i'll send you 10 20 will will stick you uh uh we'll stick some money into ave on polygon we'll let you [ __ ] around the fees are super cheap there you can start playing with d5 on polygon and then boom like everyone i've done that with it's like holy [ __ ] this is so sick this is so easy it's like yeah the the thing that you talk about like oh my god i can i can like literally like move all like a [ __ ] ton of money in like a second like are you are you kidding me like so that's what i say i say go play on ave on polygon network have fun yeah come back to me when you have more questions yeah i think yeah like for for me what i see is i think the the user experience needs to just be really simplified so i think of like a little bit more yeah it's like think apple versus like um i don't know like a google computer or like a regular microsoft computer uh or a phone they they simplified things and they kept taking things away and the more they took things away it just made the user experience so easy and i feel like that's why a lot of people you know go after apple products because they're just simple you even kind of forget that there's so much technology behind it i feel like with the crypto space it's it's like there's too many options available like i i go to send money and then it asks me for my slippage i'm like what the [ __ ] like i just want to buy something i have no idea what this is right i know come and and it's almost like right now it feels like in order to drive a car you also have to be a [ __ ] car engineer like no i just want to drive the car like just give me a gas pedal and whatever so i feel like when things like meta masks become a lot easier to sign up for and use because i i can't tell my dad to sign up for this he there's no way you know he won't get it or like somebody like if i even tell my girlfriend she's on instagram all day she's all this she's a pro boxer but like this is too involved in the tech world where she won't she will be like super confused setting up a metamask wallet so i feel like when those things become really easy i feel like a lot more people in my opinion would start jumping in because then there would be even a lot less fear yeah no i i think you're right i think user experience is probably going to be one of the biggest things and uh i i forced my uh my girlfriend to get a meta mask so that's maybe that's the i was like yo you need to do this well although she doesn't she like got it and like she hasn't touched it since i you know yeah um but uh yeah no i i agree i think user once as user experience gets better it'll just get better and better and that's another reason why i'm doing what i'm doing teaching the engineers how to like code because right it's that they're going to be the ones that are going to build it right they're going to be they want to build the user experience and make it easier and friendlier um and then i imagine at some points lots of companies will start making it where like i could go to amazon and buy in usdt like i think like once these big [ __ ] companies that we all know and love like once that starts happening or youtube starts sending me adsense in usdc like i feel like when the big player starts moving i think that might lead to mass adoption yeah i think you're right yeah so uh those are kind of my thoughts there uh and i think we touch base on solidity and okay if a developer goes into the space how much money can they realistically make um but also like how much experience does somebody need before they can start applying for jobs so like for example say i'm a developer with one or two years of experience with the traditional full stack development i'm pretty decent i have a couple of projects on my portfolio and i want to now join the blockchain world do i have to wait a couple of years before i can start applying for blockchain jobs or what's the process there no so here's what here's what i usually tell people and then it could be i think years isn't a great indicator because it's whatever time frame you can do this in here's what i usually think step one take a tutorial a course doesn't matter which one you can take my free code camp one it's great dappy university's got some great ones uh eat the blocks got some great ones you know you can watch all of all of qazi's videos uh what whatever i don't care right like do some type of tutorial get into it that's step one get the basics get like that basic solidity viper if you're using solana rust i don't care what's fun mentioning that i don't know what that is oh it's it's a it's a pythonic uh smart contract language so it's it's basically the if solidity is to javascript python or viper is to python so you you can write evm you can write ethereum smart contracts and viper it's a super sick language too uh it's used a lot less though like curve iron.finance those are some of the big ones that use it uh but yeah pick a language doesn't matter which one and go and learn something once you do that the next thing to absolutely do especially right now is join a hackathon and force yourself to like take what you've learned and like build something else because you're gonna meet a ton of people you're gonna get a ton of skills from going to a hackathon and you're going to force yourself to kind of leave what i call tutorial hell so join a hackathon right because that's where you're going to push yourself you're going to take all the tutorial stuff and you're going to run into real problems you're going to run into more problems that are outside the tutorial right tutorials are great and i make a ton of them but usually when you take those learnings and you go to the real world there's like oh but i want to tweak this like this or do this and that might be harder so force yourself to run into those problems and build something submit something the other thing that's really cool about these hackathons is there's a ton of money in them right now so that's also good you can have the chance to win but don't really think about like the winnings really just focus on okay i'm here to learn and build something and then also network i've seen tons of projects come out of hackathons and then become like protocols right so if you're into that you could leave a hackathon and become a protocol so one of the uh projects from the last chainlink hackathon this product struck finance this was like maybe four months ago they just did they i i think they met at the hackathon i could be wrong i don't actually i'd have to double check but yeah four months ago they did the challenging hackathon they just raised 3.9 million dollars so yeah so like this [ __ ] moves quick so if you do well at a hackathon go on make the protocol the other thing is they're headhunters at these hackathons so if you do really well maybe you don't even need to apply because someone's going to reach out and be like yo i want to hire you they're headhunters at these hackathons um but after that uh even you know if no headhunter reaches out to you then that's when you can start applying right after you start building some protocols uh and start feeling really competent so maybe that takes you four months maybe that takes you a year and a half maybe that takes you three years right yeah however long it takes you but yeah just start applying along the way um the other question i get a lot is internships can i go to an internship where can i internship blockchain and smart contracts are kind of these this wild world where like your internships are like everywhere yeah but but they're not traditional internships to me you're going to get a lot lot better um experience going to like maybe someone's github and trying to work on an issue or something right or going to some open source project and say oh hey like i really like this feature you know can i work on this or can i do that there's all these protocols have grants where they'll give out money for you to work on something and you're going to get way better experience doing that than like getting someone's coffee is like an intern or whatever right so so like go out like use the the fact that blockchain is so ridiculously open source is like your advantage it's like holy [ __ ] there's so many places that i can learn and work with people uh and learn from other people so it's like every company almost every company on the blockchain is open source in that way so like yeah wow yeah learn learn from all and like the other cool thing is like all of the tutorials that i do are like based off of these like insane protocols because all their code is open source so if you want to see okay what does ave do what does synthetics do what does compound do yeah the code's right there link or we'll pop up the link to the channel in the description and then also we'll show something on the screen right now and i think patrick collins if we just type that in on youtube your tutorials and videos should come up right and um even the one that i started actually learning solidity with is patrick's video that's how i know him it was i was in dubai and i went to free code camp not i didn't go to free code camp actually i typed in solidity tutorial and then patrick's popped up with two million views and it's just a [ __ ] banger yeah i like played it me and my team watched like so many hours worth of it and like learned a ton so um yeah and then you saw it was python and then you're like three hours in but like i watched the two three hours bro and i was hooked so i would highly recommend you guys watch that to learn solidity definitely and we got a javascript one with hard hat coming out soonish very soonish so definitely be sure to check that out it's gonna be sick like anybody who like oh my god like i'm i'm filming it right now dude oh my god it's so [ __ ] sick that's sick i'm excited for that one i'm excited if you get in this space and you're like yo like i'm trying to learn this [ __ ] dude like watch one of those two videos because at the end you're gonna be golden you're gonna be good to go like that all right like i said watch whatever tutorial and watch whatever tutorial but if you watch mine and you like actually go through it you are going to come out the other side [ __ ] swinging ready [ __ ] swinging right and so it'll be like 20 hours or something like that the first one was 16. yeah it's gonna take you a couple months to actually like watch it and digest but like dude it's like sick it's so good worth it all right awesome i feel like we covered a lot of the road map of how do you actually become a blockchain engineer or a solidity developer or whatever are there any other parts you want to add to it or you feel like it's pretty good what we have for it so far i think that's pretty good i mean the rest of it's kind of like the traditional you know keep learning keep grinding right like if nobody's hiring you keep learning keep grinding keep keep your github repo is your um is your resume your github repo and then also you know your your regular resume is also your resume but these are the products that i've worked on this is what i know how to do um something else i usually recommend to people is um if you are looking for a job like start writing some articles right start making a little bit of content do some tutorials did you work on something really cool great make it write an article about it there's great places like dev.2 you can just rip an article and now that's kind of like part of your resume as well like this is here this is what i know how to do uh and maybe that's a good way to get your name out there i know that us devs are usually a little bit more shy but it's still a great way to get out there and um and then maybe you just do it you get the job and then you stop writing and that's fine too yeah yeah 100 i mean yeah there are a lot of um i feel like there's a huge demand and the supply is a lot smaller like even for us we were looking for blockchain engineers and we're looking to bring some on you can even hire them and it's like it's [ __ ] hard and all the people were interviewing are like yeah i have two months of experience you know i started coding like solidity you know those are some of the best candidates we have we're like like we recently came across a couple that have like one or two years of experience and stuff and we're like yo this is this is great um one person yeah i'm really excited about but he's uh you're currently a senior blockchain engineer at meta and was ex google oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] watkins is 2013. oh my god and he wants to work with us and i was like what the [ __ ] i'm like why do you want to work we're just youtubers dude [Laughter] and uh and uh i think yeah so like he wants to also be in some of the videos so he's excited about that oh hell yeah okay um i would just say why does he that i mean i mean that's [ __ ] sick right is it because of the videos and stuff uh yeah i mean it's like of course we're gonna have him on a team he's gonna get paid oh yeah and so that's nice um but then on top of that there's gonna be some videos we're gonna have them in and i'm thinking to have been like some really cool like epic videos um i got a couple of ideas dude like even off this podcast i would love to brainstorm some video ideas with you just like create one creator to another creator um yeah because i was i was actually recently feeling like [ __ ] man i to brainstorm with somebody and i come up with ideas but most people aren't creators you know and like you are so um i will hit you up i will hit you up i'm excited about that actually seriously um i love to do this walk marina and like i just go on this long walks and then i just whoa dude a walking meeting oh yeah i'm game yeah i have i have to walk 7000 steps a day because i'm like trying to be less fat so hell yeah that sounds good ah you don't look fat you look like jacked i'm i'm bigger than i want to be uh i told people i was bulking so however i mean yeah like i feel like you're a fit dude you have the [ __ ] thanksgiving water next to you it's yeah the 64 ounce uh 64. i gotta i gotta [Laughter] just walks around with it everywhere dude dude i want to be one of those gym guys who who has like the milk carton yeah that's his water bottle i think those are fantastic so this is like a little bit less but yeah still like bigger than my [ __ ] head like we should just get jacked and have tank tops gallon of milk and writing smart contracts under time crunch dude dude one of my uh one of the one of the videos that i have planned i want to do some weird [ __ ] at the gym and then like have like a laptop where i'm like uh because so there's this new framework that just came out foundry it's it's rust based it's super fast it's really powerful and like the joke god what's gonna say you write in rust uh no so it's it's rust based it's command land base so you just do on the command line you don't have to actually do any rust i mean i have written rust stuff but yeah the joke that i was gonna make was like oh it's so powerful and i'm like [ __ ] dead lifting or some [ __ ] but then i was like that's i don't i don't know if that's that's too [ __ ] corny this framework is too good the striker is too powerful what this happens with creators right like you'll think of an idea and then you go i don't know if it's too corny and like when you execute it sometimes it's like way shittier than you had imagined and it's like really yeah what the [ __ ] like i really thought it was gonna go but like now i don't even get it like what's the joke um i have it's me all the time but i'm sure it does yeah one thing i thought about is like you can't ever give up on that part of yourself because that's the true creator and like that [ __ ] will breed so much lack of confidence in yourself when you keep having ideas and you know you keep not doing them and then like you just keep getting less and less confident as a creator so i feel like it's like even if you think it's the dumbest [ __ ] or whatever it's like just go [ __ ] do the deadlift with the laptop in your hand like this is [ __ ] powerful uh like make it a 20 second short and drop it you know but like that way you just keep increasing your confidence and like what you set what you thought you were going to do you actually do it all right cozy i'm taking those words to heart next video i drop i'm going to be [ __ ] dead lifting and doing some weird [ __ ] dude i thought tutorial that broke 2 million views i had this random idea that i'm gonna be by the ocean and i'm just gonna be waving the laptop in one arm like with one hand and i'm just like talking and i'm like doing pushups and [ __ ] when i'm teaching for loops i'm like here's what range of ten and then i did ten pushups and then i got up with a laptop and i'm just like coding and it goes back to the coding screen it's like [ __ ] crazy what that's phenomenal yeah oh my goodness um now i want to do i want to do a random pushup soon i'm coding that sounds [ __ ] sick yeah just like i'm imagining like um like doing [ __ ] bench presses and then like sitting up like from the bench press and like a table sliding over to like and then you just say all right now it's time to code for my [ __ ] rest that [ __ ] is funny dude it's like octopus when i was watching your tutorial i'm like oh like another [ __ ] professor person teaching [ __ ] you know with green screens and i was like oh this is gonna be cringy and i like watching it but then like you were dropping some references and also the way you speak i'm like this guy sounds like a savage i'm like i like this guy and i'm like this is [ __ ] cool i want to learn this so it was weird like it made me want to learn as i like bought into more of who you were you know and so i feel like if you just like interdisperse like random [ __ ] that you like in the tutorials like whether it's chess or league of legend references or like gym references i think it will it'll just make people like you and connect with you a lot more quasi we gotta so when we get on these brainstorming calls like we'll i'll i'll give you all the solidity knowledge and then you just keep feeding me the youtube [ __ ] i'm with it sounds great you keep giving me the tricks of the trade man i'm down yeah that's that's where we're headed um all right bro i think this was phenomenal if we ever do one in the future i think like we'll just do a live one because it'll be i think we'll uh we'll take questions and stuff um yeah yeah yeah because yeah i thought we riffed here really well so i'm yeah i'm game i think i think there was no like uh performance issues like yeah i think this would be a lot of fun to just rip live too performances we're about to jump into a bluetooth sponsored ad or something um uh what is it what did uh ray kroc now [ __ ] i forget it yeah yeah no i i hear what you're saying you have performance issues drink this creatine sponsored by g fuel yeah we should get sponsors on these videos man get get g fuel a red bull on the two of us just like go [ __ ] nuts for a solid 60's you want to talk smart contracts i got you what have the best [ __ ] code of your life dude i'm gay i did one video on like tic tac it like blew up and it's like and it starts and i'm just like i stand up and i'm going all crazy and i'm like she yes and then the in the caption we wrote
