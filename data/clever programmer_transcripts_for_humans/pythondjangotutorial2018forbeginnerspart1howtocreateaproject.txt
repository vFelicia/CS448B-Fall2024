With timestamps:

00:00 - - What is up, how's it going, this is Qazi
00:02 - from cleverprogrammer.com.
00:04 - What I wanted to cover
in this series is Django.
00:10 - And what I wanted to cover
was the most commonly
00:15 - referenced Django documentation.
00:18 - I personally couldn't
really find any videos
00:21 - of people covering it, so
I just wanted to do that,
00:26 - because, you know, I see,
everybody who starts learning
00:30 - Django, this is the first
place you're gonna go to,
00:32 - like the docs, the Django
official documentation
00:36 - that shows you how to do
their getting started guide.
00:40 - And so I just wanna kinda
cover that in this series.
00:44 - This first video, we're gonna do part one,
00:47 - and then every video after
that we're gonna just cover
00:49 - one part, so like the
second video will cover
00:51 - part two of the documentation.
00:54 - It's gonna be done in a
more conversational style,
00:58 - and I hope you enjoy it,
so let's get started.
01:02 - So basically Django at a glance.
01:05 - The beautiful thing about
Django, what they're saying here
01:08 - is that it lets you do
web development tasks
01:10 - in a really fast way, so
it's pretty intelligent.
01:14 - Like for example, one of the
awesome things about Django
01:16 - compared to any other
framework, even like node.js,
01:20 - right, which is very popular,
and it's a great, great,
01:22 - great framework for JavaScript,
but what makes Django
01:25 - really cool is that it
comes with a built-in
01:28 - and very robust admin interface.
01:31 - So, if you're building
an app for your client
01:33 - where, let's say you want
to build a blogging app
01:36 - for somebody, or eCommerce
app for somebody in Python,
01:41 - if you built it using
Django, it gives them
01:43 - an admin interface, so
they can just go in there
01:45 - and do stuff from there,
or you can manage the app
01:48 - for them from the admin interface.
01:50 - And, imagine this, you had to
spend zero development time
01:55 - on doing that, which means
that they're gonna think
01:58 - you're a fricking magician,
and they're gonna want
02:00 - to hire and be like, wow,
how did this guy do this.
02:03 - So, the admin thing is pretty cool.
02:07 - So, and just right now I
just wanna kind of cover
02:09 - the overview, and then we're gonna jump in
02:11 - to actually the parts
of the tutorial, okay,
02:14 - and you're just gonna follow me along.
02:17 - All right, so, I'm gonna cover
this, kind of touch on this.
02:22 - So if you have some experience with it,
02:23 - it will make a little bit of sense.
02:25 - So designing your models, so in Django
02:27 - you can kind of design your
database and models like this.
02:31 - You don't need to type in raw SQL queries,
02:33 - or mess with too many ORMs,
it's just simply classes,
02:38 - so it's literally like
Python and object oriented
02:40 - programming, and boom,
you have stuff populating
02:43 - your database, which is pretty cool.
02:47 - It also has a built-in kind of API,
02:49 - so it says, you know, as
soon as your models are done,
02:52 - the API's created on the fly,
02:54 - no code generation necessary, okay.
02:57 - So here you can see that
if you create a model,
03:00 - let's say that you're
creating an app, right,
03:02 - and it has reporters, and
your app has articles,
03:06 - you know, well, what you
can just do is just be like
03:09 - Reporter.objects.all and it will tell you
03:11 - how many reporters are there.
03:13 - For example, if you made
a game app for let's say
03:16 - Streetfighter, and you
did Fighter.objects.all,
03:20 - it might say empty set, which means
03:22 - you didn't put in any fighters yet, right.
03:24 - But then let's say you create
a fighter or a reporter
03:27 - with the name John Smith, and you save it,
03:30 - then, when you check
objects.all, all of a sudden
03:33 - it'll say hey, reporter John
Smith actually does exist.
03:37 - So, that's pretty cool,
and a really nice way
03:40 - to interface with it.
03:41 - And then also you can search for things
03:43 - in a really easy way too.
03:45 - So you can search in
your database with an ID,
03:48 - but you know, a lot of times
a more human way to search
03:51 - instead of an ID is, like, searching with
03:54 - what does the name start
with, or if the name
03:57 - contains the word mith, which
Smith actually contains,
04:00 - and it'll match it.
04:02 - So then what you can do on
your front end later is,
04:04 - right now, you're not gonna
have your client interface
04:07 - with your app from the
code command line, right.
04:09 - What you can do later is
then give them a front end,
04:12 - an interface, so they can actually type it
04:14 - in the search bar and look up John Smith,
04:18 - or type in mith, and it'll
still find John Smith.
04:22 - Kind of like when you
guys go to Shopify stores,
04:24 - or YouTube, and type in a video's name,
04:27 - and even if you're off,
it'll still find it,
04:29 - it's using this contained
search mechanism,
04:31 - which Django comes built-in with.
04:35 - Another thing I wanna touch on is,
04:38 - yeah, if you have your
model, you can register
04:42 - them in the admin interface
with just a simple
04:44 - line that says admin.site.register,
04:47 - and then that model will,
04:49 - so let's say you created
the Article model,
04:50 - you can now register it
in the admin interface,
04:53 - so then you can go an point and click
04:55 - in the admin interface, and then delete
04:57 - or create new articles or what not.
04:59 - For example, when you
have a WordPress blog,
05:03 - you know how you have an
admin interface there,
05:05 - and you can create a new
blog post, or delete a post
05:08 - or edit, you have full CRUD functionality.
05:11 - Well that's what it mimics
by you just doing this.
05:15 - And that's you creating code from scratch,
05:16 - that's kind of powerful.
05:19 - And then, obviously, let's
you design your URLs,
05:22 - so how do you want your URLs to be?
05:25 - So for example, you can
have it like, you know,
05:28 - myapp.com/articles/the year,
05:33 - followed by whatever, right.
05:34 - So you can create your own
URL parameters and whatever.
05:40 - So this is pretty standard,
but Django let you do it
05:44 - in a really clean way,
especially with Django 2.0,
05:48 - their latest release.
05:50 - All right, so, writing your
views is also pretty easy.
05:55 - You can have it just like
return an HTTP response
05:58 - or HTML file you made.
06:00 - So for example, here you can see we render
06:03 - and return this archive.html file.
06:07 - So if you create an HTML
file in your templates,
06:09 - then it's gonna be there.
06:11 - Again, if you're watching
this, and you're like,
06:13 - I'm a complete beginner,
and I have no idea
06:15 - what the heck you're
talking about, don't worry.
06:17 - If this part is just not making any sense,
06:19 - skip a little bit ahead to the part
06:21 - where we jump into the tutorial.
06:23 - This is just for people
who are maybe coming
06:25 - from other frameworks,
and they wanna grasp
06:28 - how Python and Django is working.
06:30 - So, you do need some
experience to understand
06:34 - what I'm talking about here.
06:36 - And then yeah, templates are using
06:40 - it's using Django templates,
which is kinda like Jinja.
06:44 - I'll go into this later.
06:45 - So, at this point, let's just get started.
06:49 - All right, so for your
installation all you really need
06:53 - to do is make sure you
have Python installed,
06:55 - so for myself I got Anaconda installed,
06:58 - which is what I would recommend for you.
07:01 - So if you do anaconda download online,
07:03 - kind of install that,
and that's pretty much
07:08 - all you need to go on.
07:10 - And then, obviously,
install Django as well,
07:13 - which I'll show you in one second, okay.
07:16 - All right, and then you can go ahead
07:18 - and create a project.
07:19 - So we're gonna just get
started from scratch
07:21 - and follow along with this
tutorial, so let's get started.
07:25 - Okay, so I'm gonna open
up my command line here.
07:29 - So I'm just gonna open up my terminal.
07:31 - If you're watching this,
you can open up your,
07:36 - you know, CMD on Windows,
07:40 - or, what I recommend installing
is CMDER on your Windows.
07:48 - Basically just see if you
have anaconda installed.
07:52 - And if you do, and if you type in conda,
07:53 - this thing should come up, okay.
07:56 - If you don't have anaconda
installed, that's okay,
07:58 - you can still follow me
along, but what I'm doing
08:01 - here is kind of like for best practice.
08:03 - So, if you want to do it
like the best practice way,
08:06 - then I recommend that you
get conda installed here.
08:09 - Let me just make this
a little bit smaller.
08:11 - All right, so basically
what I wanna do here is
08:17 - first, check my, so, what
I'm gonna do is install
08:21 - my environment with conda,
okay, so I'm gonna do,
08:27 - and again, installing
anaconda, and like making you
08:32 - understand everything
about a virtual environment
08:34 - is outside the scope of
this specific tutorial.
08:37 - You can look up stuff like
how to install anaconda
08:40 - on Windows, or how to
install anaconda on a Mac.
08:43 - But I'm just gonna go ahead
and do conda, or first,
08:47 - I'm gonna create this
project, so let's just see.
08:49 - I'm gonna go to my GitHub.
08:51 - All right, what I've
also done is I have gone
08:54 - into preferences in my Atom, and I have
08:58 - went in under install, and I've installed
09:04 - terminal, platformio-ide-terminal,
and I've installed it.
09:11 - So then the beauty of that is
that when I'm coding, right,
09:15 - if I'm coding I can just pop
open my terminal right in here,
09:19 - and I don't have to leave my Atom.
09:21 - So, I will do django-admin startproject
09:30 - mysite like that, and then go into mysite.
09:36 - Okay, and then I will come
over here, and I will open,
09:41 - I'll go to GitHub, and
then I'll go mysite,
09:43 - and then just click that, okay.
09:47 - That's about it.
09:50 - This is just so if you
guys are following along,
09:52 - like, I don't want you to get confused.
09:54 - I'm gonna open up my Chrome.
09:59 - So they're saying that this is pretty much
10:00 - what it should look
like, and for us it does
10:03 - look like that, right, we have mysite
10:04 - and it has all these files inside of it.
10:06 - And you can see mysite,
and it has all these files
10:09 - inside of that, okay.
10:14 - And then they say, hey, just go ahead
10:16 - and run python manage.py runserver,
10:19 - so let's go ahead and give that a try.
10:22 - So I'm gonna open up my terminal,
10:23 - and how I do that, how I
open up that little prompt
10:26 - is by doing command + shift + P.
10:29 - For you on Windows, that
might be a different
10:32 - command, like, maybe Control + shift + P.
10:36 - But yeah, for me that opens it up,
10:38 - and then I just click terminal,
pops open my terminal.
10:42 - I'm gonna do conda create --name
10:48 - mysite python=3.6
10:59 - And I will activate this environment.
11:07 - And now, I will install Django.
11:17 - Okay, so if I do pip freeze
it should show me that
11:21 - Django and a bunch of
other stuff is installed.
11:24 - Django right here, so we're good.
11:30 - All right, I'm just make the fonts bigger
11:31 - so you guys can see it a lot easier.
11:37 - Okay, so now we're gonna try to run this.
11:40 - Python.manage.py runserver.
11:44 - And we will go to this URL on our Chrome,
11:48 - and see if it shows us something.
11:53 - Okay cool, so it says
install worked successfully,
11:57 - congratulations, and, believe it or not,
12:00 - this is actually pretty exciting
because this is the first
12:06 - hint that your app is actually running.
12:09 - Now to this we're gonna add
a lot more features to it
12:12 - and make it really awesome.
12:14 - But right now it's being actually served
12:16 - over your localhost and it's running.
12:19 - And once we get it to a
point where it's doing a lot
12:22 - of cool stuff, we'll develop
it locally and then later on,
12:26 - what you can even do
is then put it online,
12:28 - so then anybody in the world
can use your Django app.
12:32 - Let's go back, and let's take
a look at what the tutorial
12:36 - is telling us to do at this point.
12:39 - So it says that you should
see this stuff, and we do.
12:43 - And then it says ignore the warning
12:45 - about unapplied database
migrations for now,
12:48 - we'll deal with the
database shortly, cool.
12:52 - And it says we have started
a Django development server,
12:56 - which is a lightweight web
server written purely in Python.
13:02 - We've included this in Django
so you can develop things
13:04 - rapidly without having
to deal with configuring
13:06 - a production server such as Apache
13:09 - until you're ready for production, cool.
13:13 - All right, and they say
don't use the server
13:15 - in anything resembling a
production environment,
13:16 - it's intended for
developing, cool, no problem.
13:19 - All right, and now they
want us to get started
13:23 - on creating the polls, the polls app.
13:29 - Now that your environment
- a project - is set up,
13:31 - you're set to start doing work.
13:33 - Each application you write
in Django consists of a pure,
13:36 - of a Python package that
follows certain convention.
13:40 - Django comes with a utility
that automatically generates
13:43 - the basic directory structure of an app,
13:45 - so you can focus on writing code
13:46 - rather than creating directories, cool.
13:49 - All right, projects versus
apps, so what's the difference
13:51 - between a project and an app?
13:54 - Now, the cool thing with Django is that
13:58 - everything is considered an app.
14:00 - So let's say that you create a website
14:02 - that has a blog, that has
a eCommerce capability.
14:06 - Now, the blog is considered,
14:10 - so let's say you created this
website with Django, right,
14:12 - the blog would be considered a Django app,
14:14 - and your eCommerce store would actually
14:18 - be considered a different Django app.
14:21 - So there would be two different apps
14:22 - that your web application is comprised of.
14:25 - That's how Django handles the logic.
14:28 - So, basically it's one project
14:31 - that has multiple apps inside of it.
14:33 - That's pretty much what
they're saying here.
14:37 - Okay, so an app is a web
application that does something,
14:40 - okay, so web blog system, a
database of public records,
14:44 - or a simple poll app.
14:45 - A project is a collection
of configuration apps
14:47 - for a particular website.
14:49 - A project can contain multiple apps,
14:52 - an app can be in multiple projects.
14:57 - So, you can have one app that
you build for one project,
15:01 - and you can actually have
it in different projects
15:03 - that you're doing, which is really cool.
15:06 - It's like plug and chug.
15:08 - Your apps can live anywhere
on your python path.
15:10 - In this tutorial, we'll
create our poll app
15:13 - right next to your manage.py file,
15:15 - so that it can be imported
as its own top-level module,
15:19 - rather than a sub module of mysite.
15:22 - To create your app, make sure
you're in the same directory
15:25 - as manage.py and type this command.
15:28 - Okay, so now this command,
manage.py startapp polls
15:31 - we're gonna do that, okay.
15:34 - So, we're gonna break our
server with control + C,
15:37 - okay, so I did that.
15:38 - I'm gonna hit ls, and it looks
like I'm at the same level
15:42 - as my manage.py file.
15:44 - If I hit pwd, pwd, it'll
show me where I'm at.
15:50 - And now, I'm gonna do
python manage.py startapp
15:56 - and the app is called polls I believe,
15:59 - just let's double check.
16:02 - Okay, so now our polls app is created,
16:05 - and let's just take a
look inside of polls.
16:10 - Okay, so inside of polls you can see
16:12 - that we have a bunch of, oh actually,
16:14 - let's look right over
here, it's easier that way.
16:17 - So polls comes with
migrations, _init_.py, admin,
16:21 - apps, models, tests, views,
there's a lot of things
16:24 - that polls comes up with automatically,
16:28 - which is really nice.
16:29 - But a lot of this stuff is, you know,
16:32 - just kind of empty.
16:34 - The main things that you're
gonna be working with
16:37 - is models and views,
okay, that's the thing
16:39 - you're gonna be working with all the time.
16:42 - When you're developing apps for yourself
16:44 - later, you're also going
to be playing around
16:46 - quite, you're gonna be
adding stuff to tests,
16:48 - to make sure you can test your
app as you're building it.
16:51 - And then migrations is
gonna be important because
16:53 - it's gonna kind of let you
time travel in your database,
16:56 - so when we keep making
changes to your database,
16:58 - with migrations, you can roll
forward to a certain time.
17:02 - But let's say things get really messed up,
17:04 - you can roll back to a
previous point in time.
17:10 - All right, so the this
directory structure will house
17:15 - the poll application.
17:17 - So this is the directory
structure that we actually saw.
17:20 - And now, they want us
to write our first view.
17:24 - A view is what lets you
go to a specific URL
17:28 - and then it returns some kind of response.
17:31 - So for example, so Django
works off of something
17:34 - called MVT, which is called
model view templates.
17:40 - Your normal apps, you
know, node.js, or whatever,
17:44 - those frameworks work off of
MVC, model view controller.
17:48 - So, to give you an example
of this in real life is,
17:52 - when you go to Google.com/, you know,
17:56 - when you go to Google.com
and you type in cats, right,
17:59 - or let's say you go to Google.com
and you type in whatever,
18:03 - the response that comes to you, right,
18:05 - that maps to the current URL you are at.
18:08 - So how does Google know to
show you the Google logo
18:12 - and the Google homepage
when you go to Google.com?
18:16 - So, Google.com, when you type it in,
18:19 - it sees what your current URL path is,
18:22 - then it goes into the Google code base,
18:25 - and then it finds this HTML file
18:29 - that says, if somebody goes to this path
18:31 - that says Google.com, then
show them this HTML page
18:36 - that has Google's image on
it followed by a search bar.
18:41 - And it shows you that, okay,
so it returns a response.
18:45 - You request something,
and it returns a response.
18:49 - If you go to apple.com/watches, or watch,
18:54 - I don't know if that's
actually a real Apple URL,
18:57 - but let's just say you're
trying to get the Apple watch.
19:00 - So if you go to apple.com/watch,
19:02 - how would it return to
you all of their watches?
19:06 - So, what actually happens
is, apple.com/watch
19:11 - will match that path in their code base
19:13 - and then it'll see if
there is an HTML file
19:17 - that corresponds to it,
and it will show you
19:19 - that HTML file, okay, as a response.
19:22 - And that's essentially
what we're gonna do,
19:25 - but we're gonna have a
very basic version of it.
19:28 - So, we're gonna go in our polls/views.py.
19:32 - So I'm in my polls, and I'm
gonna go in my views.py,
19:36 - so when they say it like
this, polls/views.py
19:38 - that's what they mean.
19:40 - And then here I'm gonna
say from django.http
19:43 - import HttpResponse, right,
19:48 - and then I'm gonna go here,
I'll say def index(request)
19:53 - to take in a request, and
then return HttpResponse.
20:00 - And I will say Hello World,
20:05 - You're at the
20:08 - let's do it with double quotes because
20:12 - Hello World, You're, what is it,
20:16 - at the polls index, right,
20:19 - and then the have a little comma here.
20:21 - This doesn't matter so
much, this is just a string,
20:23 - so it doesn't matter what you do.
20:25 - Make sure you always
save what you're doing,
20:27 - because otherwise it
won't take any affect.
20:29 - So make sure you do Control + S
20:31 - or Command + S the whole time.
20:35 - So I just created this, but the thing is
20:38 - it's not gonna show up.
20:39 - So now, what I need to do is tell my app
20:42 - that when somebody goes to the homepage
20:44 - yo, you gotta show this
exact, this thing right here.
20:51 - This is the simplest
view possible in Django.
20:53 - To call the view, we
need to map it to a URL,
20:55 - and for this we need a URL conf,
20:57 - or a URL configuration.
20:59 - To create a URL conf
in the polls directory,
21:02 - create a file called urls.py.
21:06 - Your app directory should
now look like this.
21:08 - So now notice there's a urls.py here,
21:11 - which was not there before.
21:14 - So we're gonna go in our
polls, right click here,
21:19 - and create a new file and call it urls.py.
21:25 - And now, in our urls.py we
gotta add from django.urls
21:30 - import path, from django.urls import path,
21:34 - and then we're gonna do from import views
21:39 - and then we're gonna do a urlpatterns.
21:47 - So, what you wanna do is try not to indent
21:51 - but use four spaces instead,
okay, one, two, three, four,
21:55 - if it doesn't automatically
bring you to the right place.
22:00 - And I wanna do path, so if
somebody goes to the empty path
22:06 - then I want you to go into our views file
22:09 - and use the index function,
and we're gonna call
22:13 - give it a name index.
22:17 - So what does this mean?
22:18 - If somebody goes to,
let's say your website
22:21 - is called john.com, right.
22:24 - If somebody goes to john.com
followed by nothing else,
22:27 - so not like john.com/article,
/blog, none of that,
22:31 - it's just john.com, your
homepage, what happens?
22:35 - Well then, we say go into the views file
22:38 - and run the index function.
22:40 - So under views, this
is the index function,
22:42 - and it'll run that.
22:43 - We're naming it index, so then later,
22:46 - if we want to, from
our templates, our HTML
22:49 - if we want to refer to
this specific URL path,
22:52 - we can just call it by index
and it'll reference it.
22:57 - Okay, the next step is
to point the route URL
23:00 - configuration at the polls/url module.
23:04 - So, URL conf, and we
gotta point it to this.
23:09 - So, all right, in mysite/urls.py
23:12 - add an import for django.urls.include
23:15 - and insert an include
in the urlpatterns list,
23:17 - so you have this.
23:19 - So, we're gonna go in our
mysite/urls right here.
23:24 - In here we're gonna the,
this line, okay, because
23:29 - we're saying if somebody
goes to the path polls,
23:34 - then run the polls URLs.
23:41 - Okay, so from django.contrib import admin
23:45 - from django.urls import, from django.urls
23:48 - import include, path.
23:54 - And that's because we're
gonna do the include thing
23:56 - right now, just like
that, and then hit Save.
24:01 - So if somebody types in john.com/polls,
24:05 - now we'll say hey, try
to match this pattern
24:09 - by going to the polls.urls file.
24:12 - Well, where's that?
24:13 - That's in the polls app, and
it's this file right here.
24:16 - So then it'll go to this file,
24:18 - and then it'll match this
first guy and it'll say okay,
24:20 - I'm gonna run the home function.
24:25 - So anytime somebody
goes to anything polls,
24:27 - it'll refer it to that
file, that URLs file.
24:31 - All right, this is what
they're basically saying here.
24:34 - The include function allows
referencing other URL confs.
24:38 - Whenever Django encounters
include, it chops off
24:40 - whatever part of the URL
matched up to that point
24:43 - and sends the remaining
string to the included
24:45 - URL conf for further processing.
24:47 - The idea behind include is to make it easy
24:50 - to plug and play URLs,
since polls are in their own
24:53 - URL conf, they can be
placed under, or any path,
24:57 - and the app will still work.
25:00 - Okay, you have now wired, so now it says
25:05 - you should always include,
you should always use include
25:08 - when you include other URL patterns.
25:12 - And now it says you have
now wired an index view,
25:15 - let's verify it's working,
run the following command.
25:18 - Okay, so now we're gonna run this thing,
25:23 - and we'll go to our localhost,
or this http port over here.
25:31 - And hit run.
25:34 - And now we are getting an error, oh yes,
25:38 - basically, you have to do
/polls, okay, of course.
25:44 - Because it's not a homepage
thing that we've added to,
25:47 - because I just saw this and
I was like, oh, homepage.
25:50 - But it's because we gotta
go to the polls path.
25:53 - So everything after, so it's like,
25:57 - when you put this online,
when you put this app online,
26:00 - it will essentially be
like yourapp.com/polls
26:06 - is where you'll have to
go to, and then it'll know
26:08 - what to do, okay, so it's
saying your at the polls index.
26:12 - And that's exactly what we see now, cool.
26:15 - Go to this in your browser,
and you should see the text
26:18 - which you define in index.
26:20 - The path function is
passed four arguments,
26:23 - two required, route and
view, and two optional.
26:26 - At this point it's worth reviewing
26:27 - what these arguments are for.
26:29 - All right, so we're not going
to go into too much detail,
26:31 - it's gonna be like still casual
26:33 - and we're gonna keep moving forward.
26:34 - All right, awesome, I
hope you were excited
26:38 - watching it up until this point.
26:40 - Now, in the next video
we're gonna go to part two.
26:44 - Before I let you go, I
do wanna let you know
26:47 - that I have a course called
a profitable programmer
26:50 - coming up, where if
you're more serious about,
26:54 - you know, becoming a web developer,
26:56 - learning Django more in depth,
26:58 - and especially learning how
to get clients with Django
27:03 - and Python, and to start
working as a developer,
27:06 - then definitely go to this page.
27:10 - We'll put this link right
over here, and basically
27:14 - I want you to sign up and
put your email for our VIP
27:17 - wait list, so then you're
the first one to know
27:19 - when this course opens
up, and also I'll send you
27:23 - my resources that helped
me become a developer
27:26 - in less than three months,
and I'll give you that
27:29 - as a gift for free, okay,
for joining this wait list.
27:32 - With that said, that's
it, and I'll see you
27:34 - in part two of this tutorial.
27:36 - For those of you guys
wondering what the hell
27:37 - those choice.set thing,
it actually comes built in
27:40 - and you can actually change that
27:41 - by passing in a related
name keyword argument
27:44 - when you're creating
the question attribute,
27:47 - and you can give it
whatever name you want.

Cleaned transcript:

What is up, how's it going, this is Qazi from cleverprogrammer.com. What I wanted to cover in this series is Django. And what I wanted to cover was the most commonly referenced Django documentation. I personally couldn't really find any videos of people covering it, so I just wanted to do that, because, you know, I see, everybody who starts learning Django, this is the first place you're gonna go to, like the docs, the Django official documentation that shows you how to do their getting started guide. And so I just wanna kinda cover that in this series. This first video, we're gonna do part one, and then every video after that we're gonna just cover one part, so like the second video will cover part two of the documentation. It's gonna be done in a more conversational style, and I hope you enjoy it, so let's get started. So basically Django at a glance. The beautiful thing about Django, what they're saying here is that it lets you do web development tasks in a really fast way, so it's pretty intelligent. Like for example, one of the awesome things about Django compared to any other framework, even like node.js, right, which is very popular, and it's a great, great, great framework for JavaScript, but what makes Django really cool is that it comes with a builtin and very robust admin interface. So, if you're building an app for your client where, let's say you want to build a blogging app for somebody, or eCommerce app for somebody in Python, if you built it using Django, it gives them an admin interface, so they can just go in there and do stuff from there, or you can manage the app for them from the admin interface. And, imagine this, you had to spend zero development time on doing that, which means that they're gonna think you're a fricking magician, and they're gonna want to hire and be like, wow, how did this guy do this. So, the admin thing is pretty cool. So, and just right now I just wanna kind of cover the overview, and then we're gonna jump in to actually the parts of the tutorial, okay, and you're just gonna follow me along. All right, so, I'm gonna cover this, kind of touch on this. So if you have some experience with it, it will make a little bit of sense. So designing your models, so in Django you can kind of design your database and models like this. You don't need to type in raw SQL queries, or mess with too many ORMs, it's just simply classes, so it's literally like Python and object oriented programming, and boom, you have stuff populating your database, which is pretty cool. It also has a builtin kind of API, so it says, you know, as soon as your models are done, the API's created on the fly, no code generation necessary, okay. So here you can see that if you create a model, let's say that you're creating an app, right, and it has reporters, and your app has articles, you know, well, what you can just do is just be like Reporter.objects.all and it will tell you how many reporters are there. For example, if you made a game app for let's say Streetfighter, and you did Fighter.objects.all, it might say empty set, which means you didn't put in any fighters yet, right. But then let's say you create a fighter or a reporter with the name John Smith, and you save it, then, when you check objects.all, all of a sudden it'll say hey, reporter John Smith actually does exist. So, that's pretty cool, and a really nice way to interface with it. And then also you can search for things in a really easy way too. So you can search in your database with an ID, but you know, a lot of times a more human way to search instead of an ID is, like, searching with what does the name start with, or if the name contains the word mith, which Smith actually contains, and it'll match it. So then what you can do on your front end later is, right now, you're not gonna have your client interface with your app from the code command line, right. What you can do later is then give them a front end, an interface, so they can actually type it in the search bar and look up John Smith, or type in mith, and it'll still find John Smith. Kind of like when you guys go to Shopify stores, or YouTube, and type in a video's name, and even if you're off, it'll still find it, it's using this contained search mechanism, which Django comes builtin with. Another thing I wanna touch on is, yeah, if you have your model, you can register them in the admin interface with just a simple line that says admin.site.register, and then that model will, so let's say you created the Article model, you can now register it in the admin interface, so then you can go an point and click in the admin interface, and then delete or create new articles or what not. For example, when you have a WordPress blog, you know how you have an admin interface there, and you can create a new blog post, or delete a post or edit, you have full CRUD functionality. Well that's what it mimics by you just doing this. And that's you creating code from scratch, that's kind of powerful. And then, obviously, let's you design your URLs, so how do you want your URLs to be? So for example, you can have it like, you know, myapp.com/articles/the year, followed by whatever, right. So you can create your own URL parameters and whatever. So this is pretty standard, but Django let you do it in a really clean way, especially with Django 2.0, their latest release. All right, so, writing your views is also pretty easy. You can have it just like return an HTTP response or HTML file you made. So for example, here you can see we render and return this archive.html file. So if you create an HTML file in your templates, then it's gonna be there. Again, if you're watching this, and you're like, I'm a complete beginner, and I have no idea what the heck you're talking about, don't worry. If this part is just not making any sense, skip a little bit ahead to the part where we jump into the tutorial. This is just for people who are maybe coming from other frameworks, and they wanna grasp how Python and Django is working. So, you do need some experience to understand what I'm talking about here. And then yeah, templates are using it's using Django templates, which is kinda like Jinja. I'll go into this later. So, at this point, let's just get started. All right, so for your installation all you really need to do is make sure you have Python installed, so for myself I got Anaconda installed, which is what I would recommend for you. So if you do anaconda download online, kind of install that, and that's pretty much all you need to go on. And then, obviously, install Django as well, which I'll show you in one second, okay. All right, and then you can go ahead and create a project. So we're gonna just get started from scratch and follow along with this tutorial, so let's get started. Okay, so I'm gonna open up my command line here. So I'm just gonna open up my terminal. If you're watching this, you can open up your, you know, CMD on Windows, or, what I recommend installing is CMDER on your Windows. Basically just see if you have anaconda installed. And if you do, and if you type in conda, this thing should come up, okay. If you don't have anaconda installed, that's okay, you can still follow me along, but what I'm doing here is kind of like for best practice. So, if you want to do it like the best practice way, then I recommend that you get conda installed here. Let me just make this a little bit smaller. All right, so basically what I wanna do here is first, check my, so, what I'm gonna do is install my environment with conda, okay, so I'm gonna do, and again, installing anaconda, and like making you understand everything about a virtual environment is outside the scope of this specific tutorial. You can look up stuff like how to install anaconda on Windows, or how to install anaconda on a Mac. But I'm just gonna go ahead and do conda, or first, I'm gonna create this project, so let's just see. I'm gonna go to my GitHub. All right, what I've also done is I have gone into preferences in my Atom, and I have went in under install, and I've installed terminal, platformioideterminal, and I've installed it. So then the beauty of that is that when I'm coding, right, if I'm coding I can just pop open my terminal right in here, and I don't have to leave my Atom. So, I will do djangoadmin startproject mysite like that, and then go into mysite. Okay, and then I will come over here, and I will open, I'll go to GitHub, and then I'll go mysite, and then just click that, okay. That's about it. This is just so if you guys are following along, like, I don't want you to get confused. I'm gonna open up my Chrome. So they're saying that this is pretty much what it should look like, and for us it does look like that, right, we have mysite and it has all these files inside of it. And you can see mysite, and it has all these files inside of that, okay. And then they say, hey, just go ahead and run python manage.py runserver, so let's go ahead and give that a try. So I'm gonna open up my terminal, and how I do that, how I open up that little prompt is by doing command + shift + P. For you on Windows, that might be a different command, like, maybe Control + shift + P. But yeah, for me that opens it up, and then I just click terminal, pops open my terminal. I'm gonna do conda create name mysite python=3.6 And I will activate this environment. And now, I will install Django. Okay, so if I do pip freeze it should show me that Django and a bunch of other stuff is installed. Django right here, so we're good. All right, I'm just make the fonts bigger so you guys can see it a lot easier. Okay, so now we're gonna try to run this. Python.manage.py runserver. And we will go to this URL on our Chrome, and see if it shows us something. Okay cool, so it says install worked successfully, congratulations, and, believe it or not, this is actually pretty exciting because this is the first hint that your app is actually running. Now to this we're gonna add a lot more features to it and make it really awesome. But right now it's being actually served over your localhost and it's running. And once we get it to a point where it's doing a lot of cool stuff, we'll develop it locally and then later on, what you can even do is then put it online, so then anybody in the world can use your Django app. Let's go back, and let's take a look at what the tutorial is telling us to do at this point. So it says that you should see this stuff, and we do. And then it says ignore the warning about unapplied database migrations for now, we'll deal with the database shortly, cool. And it says we have started a Django development server, which is a lightweight web server written purely in Python. We've included this in Django so you can develop things rapidly without having to deal with configuring a production server such as Apache until you're ready for production, cool. All right, and they say don't use the server in anything resembling a production environment, it's intended for developing, cool, no problem. All right, and now they want us to get started on creating the polls, the polls app. Now that your environment a project is set up, you're set to start doing work. Each application you write in Django consists of a pure, of a Python package that follows certain convention. Django comes with a utility that automatically generates the basic directory structure of an app, so you can focus on writing code rather than creating directories, cool. All right, projects versus apps, so what's the difference between a project and an app? Now, the cool thing with Django is that everything is considered an app. So let's say that you create a website that has a blog, that has a eCommerce capability. Now, the blog is considered, so let's say you created this website with Django, right, the blog would be considered a Django app, and your eCommerce store would actually be considered a different Django app. So there would be two different apps that your web application is comprised of. That's how Django handles the logic. So, basically it's one project that has multiple apps inside of it. That's pretty much what they're saying here. Okay, so an app is a web application that does something, okay, so web blog system, a database of public records, or a simple poll app. A project is a collection of configuration apps for a particular website. A project can contain multiple apps, an app can be in multiple projects. So, you can have one app that you build for one project, and you can actually have it in different projects that you're doing, which is really cool. It's like plug and chug. Your apps can live anywhere on your python path. In this tutorial, we'll create our poll app right next to your manage.py file, so that it can be imported as its own toplevel module, rather than a sub module of mysite. To create your app, make sure you're in the same directory as manage.py and type this command. Okay, so now this command, manage.py startapp polls we're gonna do that, okay. So, we're gonna break our server with control + C, okay, so I did that. I'm gonna hit ls, and it looks like I'm at the same level as my manage.py file. If I hit pwd, pwd, it'll show me where I'm at. And now, I'm gonna do python manage.py startapp and the app is called polls I believe, just let's double check. Okay, so now our polls app is created, and let's just take a look inside of polls. Okay, so inside of polls you can see that we have a bunch of, oh actually, let's look right over here, it's easier that way. So polls comes with migrations, _init_.py, admin, apps, models, tests, views, there's a lot of things that polls comes up with automatically, which is really nice. But a lot of this stuff is, you know, just kind of empty. The main things that you're gonna be working with is models and views, okay, that's the thing you're gonna be working with all the time. When you're developing apps for yourself later, you're also going to be playing around quite, you're gonna be adding stuff to tests, to make sure you can test your app as you're building it. And then migrations is gonna be important because it's gonna kind of let you time travel in your database, so when we keep making changes to your database, with migrations, you can roll forward to a certain time. But let's say things get really messed up, you can roll back to a previous point in time. All right, so the this directory structure will house the poll application. So this is the directory structure that we actually saw. And now, they want us to write our first view. A view is what lets you go to a specific URL and then it returns some kind of response. So for example, so Django works off of something called MVT, which is called model view templates. Your normal apps, you know, node.js, or whatever, those frameworks work off of MVC, model view controller. So, to give you an example of this in real life is, when you go to Google.com/, you know, when you go to Google.com and you type in cats, right, or let's say you go to Google.com and you type in whatever, the response that comes to you, right, that maps to the current URL you are at. So how does Google know to show you the Google logo and the Google homepage when you go to Google.com? So, Google.com, when you type it in, it sees what your current URL path is, then it goes into the Google code base, and then it finds this HTML file that says, if somebody goes to this path that says Google.com, then show them this HTML page that has Google's image on it followed by a search bar. And it shows you that, okay, so it returns a response. You request something, and it returns a response. If you go to apple.com/watches, or watch, I don't know if that's actually a real Apple URL, but let's just say you're trying to get the Apple watch. So if you go to apple.com/watch, how would it return to you all of their watches? So, what actually happens is, apple.com/watch will match that path in their code base and then it'll see if there is an HTML file that corresponds to it, and it will show you that HTML file, okay, as a response. And that's essentially what we're gonna do, but we're gonna have a very basic version of it. So, we're gonna go in our polls/views.py. So I'm in my polls, and I'm gonna go in my views.py, so when they say it like this, polls/views.py that's what they mean. And then here I'm gonna say from django.http import HttpResponse, right, and then I'm gonna go here, I'll say def index(request) to take in a request, and then return HttpResponse. And I will say Hello World, You're at the let's do it with double quotes because Hello World, You're, what is it, at the polls index, right, and then the have a little comma here. This doesn't matter so much, this is just a string, so it doesn't matter what you do. Make sure you always save what you're doing, because otherwise it won't take any affect. So make sure you do Control + S or Command + S the whole time. So I just created this, but the thing is it's not gonna show up. So now, what I need to do is tell my app that when somebody goes to the homepage yo, you gotta show this exact, this thing right here. This is the simplest view possible in Django. To call the view, we need to map it to a URL, and for this we need a URL conf, or a URL configuration. To create a URL conf in the polls directory, create a file called urls.py. Your app directory should now look like this. So now notice there's a urls.py here, which was not there before. So we're gonna go in our polls, right click here, and create a new file and call it urls.py. And now, in our urls.py we gotta add from django.urls import path, from django.urls import path, and then we're gonna do from import views and then we're gonna do a urlpatterns. So, what you wanna do is try not to indent but use four spaces instead, okay, one, two, three, four, if it doesn't automatically bring you to the right place. And I wanna do path, so if somebody goes to the empty path then I want you to go into our views file and use the index function, and we're gonna call give it a name index. So what does this mean? If somebody goes to, let's say your website is called john.com, right. If somebody goes to john.com followed by nothing else, so not like john.com/article, /blog, none of that, it's just john.com, your homepage, what happens? Well then, we say go into the views file and run the index function. So under views, this is the index function, and it'll run that. We're naming it index, so then later, if we want to, from our templates, our HTML if we want to refer to this specific URL path, we can just call it by index and it'll reference it. Okay, the next step is to point the route URL configuration at the polls/url module. So, URL conf, and we gotta point it to this. So, all right, in mysite/urls.py add an import for django.urls.include and insert an include in the urlpatterns list, so you have this. So, we're gonna go in our mysite/urls right here. In here we're gonna the, this line, okay, because we're saying if somebody goes to the path polls, then run the polls URLs. Okay, so from django.contrib import admin from django.urls import, from django.urls import include, path. And that's because we're gonna do the include thing right now, just like that, and then hit Save. So if somebody types in john.com/polls, now we'll say hey, try to match this pattern by going to the polls.urls file. Well, where's that? That's in the polls app, and it's this file right here. So then it'll go to this file, and then it'll match this first guy and it'll say okay, I'm gonna run the home function. So anytime somebody goes to anything polls, it'll refer it to that file, that URLs file. All right, this is what they're basically saying here. The include function allows referencing other URL confs. Whenever Django encounters include, it chops off whatever part of the URL matched up to that point and sends the remaining string to the included URL conf for further processing. The idea behind include is to make it easy to plug and play URLs, since polls are in their own URL conf, they can be placed under, or any path, and the app will still work. Okay, you have now wired, so now it says you should always include, you should always use include when you include other URL patterns. And now it says you have now wired an index view, let's verify it's working, run the following command. Okay, so now we're gonna run this thing, and we'll go to our localhost, or this http port over here. And hit run. And now we are getting an error, oh yes, basically, you have to do /polls, okay, of course. Because it's not a homepage thing that we've added to, because I just saw this and I was like, oh, homepage. But it's because we gotta go to the polls path. So everything after, so it's like, when you put this online, when you put this app online, it will essentially be like yourapp.com/polls is where you'll have to go to, and then it'll know what to do, okay, so it's saying your at the polls index. And that's exactly what we see now, cool. Go to this in your browser, and you should see the text which you define in index. The path function is passed four arguments, two required, route and view, and two optional. At this point it's worth reviewing what these arguments are for. All right, so we're not going to go into too much detail, it's gonna be like still casual and we're gonna keep moving forward. All right, awesome, I hope you were excited watching it up until this point. Now, in the next video we're gonna go to part two. Before I let you go, I do wanna let you know that I have a course called a profitable programmer coming up, where if you're more serious about, you know, becoming a web developer, learning Django more in depth, and especially learning how to get clients with Django and Python, and to start working as a developer, then definitely go to this page. We'll put this link right over here, and basically I want you to sign up and put your email for our VIP wait list, so then you're the first one to know when this course opens up, and also I'll send you my resources that helped me become a developer in less than three months, and I'll give you that as a gift for free, okay, for joining this wait list. With that said, that's it, and I'll see you in part two of this tutorial. For those of you guys wondering what the hell those choice.set thing, it actually comes built in and you can actually change that by passing in a related name keyword argument when you're creating the question attribute, and you can give it whatever name you want.
