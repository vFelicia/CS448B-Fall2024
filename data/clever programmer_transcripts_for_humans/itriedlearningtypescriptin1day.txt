00:00 - what the hell is typescript let's talk
00:02 - about it
00:03 - [Music]
00:13 - so we're here in portland oregon
00:17 - [Music]
00:25 - and we are planning our first biggest
00:28 - javascript tour
00:29 - in 2021 it's taking place on august 6th
00:32 - through 8th so if you want to show up
00:34 - it's happening in los angeles and it's
00:36 - gonna be the best
00:37 - event you probably have been so far so
00:40 - shameless plug
00:41 - get the tickets now with that said what
00:44 - are we going to be doing today now so we
00:45 - came here we thought you know what
00:47 - why not do something fun like learning
00:49 - typescript
00:50 - in one day exactly now i don't know we
00:52 - might succeed or we might
00:54 - horribly fail hopefully we'll fail we'll
00:58 - find out
00:59 - let's go oh and by the way before we
01:01 - continue this video if you want to
01:03 - become a developer
01:04 - and you want to make over a six-figure
01:05 - income and you love puppies
01:07 - then smash and break that like button
01:09 - right now and here's a picture
01:11 - of a koala bear just to thank you
01:43 - typescript is a superset of javascript
01:47 - which means you get to write javascript
01:48 - but with static typing
01:50 - in other words javascript is a little
01:52 - tiny baby
01:53 - of typescript in english typescript
01:56 - keeps javascript in check so it behaves
01:58 - like a good little girl
02:04 - nice so food like that now you might be
02:06 - wondering why should i switch to
02:08 - typescript
02:09 - and effectively write more code and
02:11 - that's a great question
02:12 - it helped airbnb reduce their bugs and
02:15 - their code base by about 38
02:18 - by switching from javascript to
02:20 - typescript when they did their
02:21 - post-mortem analysis
02:23 - after slack made the switch from
02:25 - javascript to
02:26 - typescript it boosted their productivity
02:29 - the stability of their code
02:31 - and according to them even their mental
02:33 - sanity according to the stack overflow
02:35 - 2020 survey typescript was the number
02:39 - two
02:40 - most loved programming language
02:42 - additionally developers who learn the
02:44 - skill of typescript
02:46 - make about 125 000
02:49 - a year or more depending on their
02:52 - experience and location
02:55 - [Music]
02:59 - after doing so much research from
03:01 - everywhere i
03:02 - found out what's the number one reason
03:04 - really anybody uses typescript and it's
03:06 - this
03:07 - fewer bugs so basically typescript can
03:10 - tell you're about to make a mistake
03:12 - before you make it like for example
03:14 - hitting on a girl that's there with her
03:16 - boyfriend
03:18 - no no don't do that stop don't do that
03:24 - [Music]
03:29 - i told you don't
03:33 - anyways back to the video it can do a
03:35 - lot of things for example it can
03:37 - validate your javascript ahead of time
03:39 - typescript can also be used for both
03:41 - front-end and back-end
03:42 - applications another cool thing about
03:44 - typescript is you
03:46 - don't really need any learning curve
03:48 - let's take a look at how we actually
03:50 - start up our first application
03:52 - in typescript so let's go ahead and
03:54 - install typescript using npm install
03:56 - typescript we'll create a new folder
03:58 - called typescript
03:59 - app let's open that folder in vs code
04:02 - create a new file called index.html and
04:04 - another one main.ts for our typescript
04:06 - file console log hello go
04:08 - back to insta.html let's link the
04:09 - javascript file but we're linking
04:11 - main.js
04:12 - open an integrated terminal do tsc
04:15 - main.ts to go ahead and compile our
04:17 - typescript file into
04:18 - main.js create a function who's a nice
04:20 - little boy give it a parameter name with
04:22 - the type string and return type of voice
04:24 - console log
04:25 - name plus is a nice little boy yay next
04:28 - create available best person with the
04:29 - type string
04:30 - and the value javascript let's call the
04:32 - function who's a nice little boy
04:33 - open with a live server boom check it
04:36 - out
04:36 - that is your first typescript app
04:39 - another useful feature that was added to
04:41 - typescript is something called
04:42 - interfaces an interface is basically you
04:45 - defining
04:46 - what object that is so let's just say i
04:48 - have an object
04:49 - named food right i can define what that
04:52 - object will have
04:53 - i can define if the object will have a
04:55 - color the object will have for example
04:57 - a taste it's kind of like when you have
04:59 - food and you know exactly what the
05:02 - ingredients
05:03 - are for that food might be asking at
05:04 - this point nasa and kazi
05:06 - how does it work in a browser device
05:08 - creating your file a different type of
05:10 - file well check this out it doesn't work
05:12 - in the browser you
05:13 - actually need a compiler to compile a
05:16 - typescript code
05:17 - into javascript code you're turning the
05:20 - typescript code into the javascript code
05:21 - and that is what your browser will
05:23 - understand and according to typescript
05:26 - and their
05:27 - tagline typescript is javascript that
05:30 - scales
05:31 - as you gain a stronger skill set and you
05:33 - are an intermediate level developer i
05:35 - think it's great to start adding in
05:37 - typescript and the reason is
05:38 - as you start to work on more complex
05:41 - projects that's the time you actually
05:43 - need
05:43 - typescript if you're working on tiny
05:45 - small projects it's just gonna get in
05:47 - your way
05:47 - and slow you down now technically
05:49 - speaking i'm gonna put javascript coded
05:51 - some typescript code side by side here
05:54 - she's showing an example and if you take
05:56 - a look at this example
05:57 - on the left hand side a function written
05:59 - in javascript on the right hand side
06:02 - it looks extremely similar to the
06:03 - javascript code except in typescript you
06:06 - are specifically saying that name can
06:08 - only be a string type and you can
06:10 - enforce that when you pass
06:11 - a array to greeter function instead of a
06:14 - string
06:15 - you can see that before you even run
06:17 - your code it tells you hey
06:18 - argument of type string is not
06:20 - assignable to a parameter of type string
06:22 - so there you have it that's typescript
06:25 - in a nutshell if you
06:26 - are a complete beginner should they
06:28 - learn it i would say if you're complete
06:30 - beginner
06:30 - don't bother learning it just yet focus
06:33 - on just the foundations of javascript
06:35 - but if you are more advanced you can
06:37 - jump into it
06:37 - go ahead and smash that like button for
06:40 - us for all the fun that you probably had
06:42 - watching it
06:43 - and of course one last thing that we
06:45 - have to say there
06:46 - is a in-person event that we're doing
06:49 - it's gonna be the first one we've ever
06:51 - done it's gonna be one of the best ones
06:53 - happening august 6th through august 8th
06:56 - it's going to be in los
06:57 - angeles jump in buy the ticket fly in
07:00 - this is going to be an event of a
07:02 - lifetime it's going to be a totally
07:04 - life-changing experience
07:05 - you're going to pick up all kinds of
07:07 - crazy skills html css javascript build
07:09 - relationships of a lifetime with other
07:11 - like-minded crazy amazing people just
07:13 - like yourself
07:14 - i mean we'll just have so much fun in
07:15 - general i mean you've been stuck
07:17 - in covent land for so long now at this
07:19 - point time to get out of it so
07:21 - show up and let's show out we love your
07:23 - beautiful face we want to see you
