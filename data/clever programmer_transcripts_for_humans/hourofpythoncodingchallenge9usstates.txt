00:06 - hey guys what's up how's it going this
00:09 - is Kazi from clever programmer common in
00:11 - this video we're going to tackle the US
00:14 - states challenge so now we have
00:16 - completed all of the challenges in the
00:19 - string challenges section so lower case
00:22 - all the way through abbreviate or
00:24 - challenge or you should have completed
00:25 - it if you didn't that's okay just follow
00:28 - along from here okay and then later you
00:31 - can go back and do the other ones and
00:33 - then after this we have just three more
00:36 - two more challenges left after this one
00:38 - okay so we're almost at the finish line
00:40 - now in this challenge it's going to have
00:43 - to do with United States States okay
00:47 - hence US states challenge and basically
00:50 - how it works is just like a dictionary
00:52 - it's like a lookup okay so you give me a
00:55 - state like NC and I give you back North
00:58 - Carolina if you give me a CA I give you
01:02 - back California what happens if I give
01:05 - you il you give me back ill annoy if
01:08 - you're not in United States and you
01:09 - won't notice at the top of your head but
01:11 - you know US has 50 states and each state
01:15 - has like an acronym two letters long and
01:17 - that turns into like bigger like NY is
01:20 - going to be New York so you could you
01:26 - basically what you would have to do is
01:27 - create a giant dictionary right with key
01:31 - value pairs that's what you would have
01:32 - to do so for example you would create
01:35 - something called States like a
01:37 - dictionary like this and you would say
01:38 - and Y : New York okay and then how you
01:47 - would use that is you would say States
01:51 - and you would index it by NY and what
01:55 - this would return is New York okay kind
02:00 - of like that now if we had this
02:03 - dictionary be bigger and have more
02:05 - elements in it it would look like you
02:08 - know it would have another key called ca
02:12 - and then the value of this key would be
02:15 - California okay just like that so now if
02:20 - I take this I put it in my command line
02:23 - right so I open up let's send my command
02:25 - line I go into Python I paste that
02:27 - dictionary it's not getting pasted okay
02:29 - there it is I pasted that dictionary I
02:32 - do States now if I do States and Y what
02:35 - you'll notice is it gives me back New
02:37 - York exactly what we wanted and I'll do
02:40 - States and then I'll do CA this time it
02:43 - gives us back California cool okay so
02:46 - now that we have both of our states we
02:49 - would just have to repeat this process
02:50 - for all of the 50 states but as you know
02:53 - that that could take up a lot of typing
02:56 - or a lot of copy pasting even if you go
02:58 - to something like Wikipedia so what did
03:01 - it for us which is very nice of them I'm
03:04 - going to comment this out is they create
03:07 - another file it's called us dot py okay
03:10 - and this file has basically a long
03:13 - dictionary called States and it has the
03:16 - key value pairs for all the states so
03:18 - for example a K is Alaska al is Alabama
03:21 - AR is Arkansas and then if you keep
03:24 - going down the same way right and then
03:26 - we see NY is New York and if I search
03:29 - for il which is right here il Illinois
03:32 - boom done okay so what we're going to do
03:35 - is we're going to leverage the
03:36 - dictionary that they gave us so here we
03:40 - say from US imports states so what that
03:43 - basically means is now we have access to
03:45 - the variable states and when we do
03:47 - states we get back this this variable
03:51 - States that's it okay but the reason why
03:54 - we put it in another file is so it's
03:56 - easier for us to see our code in this
04:01 - file there as it'll get too messy like
04:02 - for example I can copy it and just paste
04:05 - it in here but you can see like it just
04:07 - takes up a lot of space so it's not
04:09 - really necessary and plus we're learning
04:12 - how to import files which is an amazing
04:15 - thing to learn and it's it makes your
04:17 - magician encoding because you can use
04:20 - other people's libraries and other
04:22 - people's existing code to make it work
04:24 - with your own and you don't
04:25 - you can basically build on the shoulders
04:27 - of giants
04:29 - okay so let's go down here and figure
04:34 - out what the answer is so at this point
04:35 - try pausing the video and see if you can
04:38 - come up with a solution whatever
04:39 - solution you come up with put it in the
04:41 - comments below and if you're on YouTube
04:43 - click the link below so you can go onto
04:46 - my website code it up in there and then
04:48 - post your solution in the comment
04:50 - section below and then I'll take a look
04:51 - at it and right now I'm just going to go
04:54 - through and show you the answer I'm
04:56 - going to work through it live so I'll
04:58 - figure it out with you so if you didn't
05:01 - try it try it right now okay let's go
05:04 - through the answer now okay so how would
05:07 - I do it um I think it would be very
05:09 - simple I will say okay so if you give me
05:13 - a breviary I just have to pass it as an
05:16 - index so like for example States
05:20 - abbreviation right so if you give me NC
05:23 - and you pass NC to that giant dictionary
05:27 - it'll go and it will find NC let's see
05:30 - NCS right here North Carolina and then
05:33 - it'll just print out this value that's
05:35 - how dictionaries work if you index it by
05:37 - the key you get back the value all right
05:42 - so that's what I'm going to do I'm just
05:44 - going to do states here oops and I think
05:49 - that should work I think that's that
05:51 - should be the solution now let's try
05:53 - running and let's see what happens I get
05:55 - back North Carolina in California here
05:57 - it says that if I do NC I should get
06:00 - back North Carolina and we do NC and we
06:04 - do indeed get back North Carolina so as
06:07 - far as we are concerned we have solved
06:10 - this challenge okay beautiful job that's
06:13 - it for this video guys if there are any
06:15 - questions put them in the comments below
06:17 - I'll jump in there and somebody or
06:19 - somebody else will to help you out but
06:22 - hopefully you're following these
06:24 - challenges so far my new course called
06:26 - create apps with Python comes out this
06:29 - June 26th okay so with these new skills
06:34 - that you got from doing these challenges
06:35 - you're now ready to be able to create
06:38 - apps
06:38 - real-world apps that you can put into
06:40 - the hands of other people so then they
06:43 - can use it as well and you can land your
06:46 - first client with Python because my goal
06:48 - is to start getting you paychecks with
06:51 - Python ok so that's it for this video
06:54 - guys as always I love your guys faces
06:56 - off see the link for the new course sign
06:59 - up for the waiting list of that course
07:00 - you're the first one to join that's it
07:03 - and I'll see you in the next video

hey guys what's up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer common in this video we're going to tackle the US states challenge so now we have completed all of the challenges in the string challenges section so lower case all the way through abbreviate or challenge or you should have completed it if you didn't that's okay just follow along from here okay and then later you can go back and do the other ones and then after this we have just three more two more challenges left after this one okay so we're almost at the finish line now in this challenge it's going to have to do with
