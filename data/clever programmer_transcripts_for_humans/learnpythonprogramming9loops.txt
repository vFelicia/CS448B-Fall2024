00:00 - - Okay, so now that
we've talked a little bit
00:03 - about functions with their arguments
00:05 - and also a little bit about functions
00:07 - with multiple arguments,
this naturally leads us
00:11 - to the next thing. What if I
want to make that one square
00:16 - but I want to make it multiple times?
00:19 - Sure, I can copy it and paste this line
00:23 - and paste it again, right,
00:26 - and then paste it again,
00:28 - so and and so forth. So, for example,
00:30 - let's try having it pasted twice.
00:33 - I'm gonna remove these comments here,
00:36 - and just so you remember, this
50 goes in for the length,
00:40 - it replaces every part
of the length with 50.
00:43 - This 90 goes for the angle, it
replaces every angle with 90.
00:47 - That's how it works, okay.
00:49 - So let's go back real quick
and simply run this now.
00:54 - Okay, so I'm gonna hit the
shortcut key to run it.
00:59 - And you can see I said draw
two squares and it did.
01:03 - But, here is the most amazing
concept in programming,
01:09 - which is the concept of doing
things over and over again,
01:12 - also known as loops.
01:14 - So if I said I want you to do 10 pushups,
01:19 - that's like a loop.
01:22 - And every time you do a pushup
01:23 - I count one, two, three, four.
01:25 - And then once you hit
10 I stop automatically.
01:28 - So a way to say that here is you can say
01:32 - for pushup in range 10.
01:35 - So for each pushup for 10 times, do this.
01:40 - And this pushup part, I can
call it whatever I want.
01:42 - I can call it this,
01:44 - I can call it I,
01:46 - we'll just keep it simple
and leave it at one letter I.
01:50 - And what we're gonna do is,
01:52 - all this part says is run
something 10 times, okay.
01:58 - That's what that part essentially says.
02:01 - If I run that code on the left hand side,
02:03 - if I show you what a range of 10 gives me,
02:05 - it gives me this.
02:07 - So when I do range 10 it
won't really show you,
02:10 - it kinda hides what it gives you,
02:12 - but in reality it gives you
a list of 10 numbers, okay.
02:17 - So we're gonna talk about
more things like lists
02:20 - and integers and floating
points in our next video.
02:23 - But for now, I just
want you to think of it
02:26 - like it gives us 10 things
and so it runs 10 times.
02:30 - Okay, so if I did for I in range 10,
02:35 - and I said print I,
02:39 - what actually happens is
the first time in this list,
02:42 - the first time you run
through in this loop,
02:45 - I is zero.
02:46 - Then the next time,
02:48 - this range 10 is really this list here,
02:52 - so I is zero the first time then it's one,
02:55 - then it's two, then it's
three, then it's four.
02:57 - And each time what happens in the loop
02:59 - is the part that's indented
inside of the loop,
03:02 - that's the part that runs
over and over and over again.
03:06 - So what happens the first time I is zero,
03:08 - we say print zero and we
get the zero right here.
03:11 - Then we say I is one,
so I is one over here,
03:14 - and then it says print
one, we get one over here.
03:18 - Then in the last one,
I turns out to be nine,
03:21 - so we print nine and then
we get this nine over here.
03:25 - Okay, that's the basic
idea of how the loop works.
03:29 - So the part that we want
to run over and over again,
03:34 - we're going to put it inside of this loop.
03:36 - Notice the colon at the
end, very important.
03:39 - And I'm gonna put this
part inside of the loop.
03:42 - And I don't even need to put that,
03:44 - I can just do this
03:48 - and I'm basically saying,
03:49 - do this thing here, draw
a square, four times.
03:53 - That's all I'm saying, okay.
03:55 - And I will replace this
code in that regular way
03:59 - without a loop and I'll prove it to you.
04:00 - So first let's run it like this.
04:08 - Dang, that was cool, right?
04:11 - That was really frickin cool.
04:13 - It just ran that four times in a row.
04:15 - Now, I can show you what I mean, okay,
04:21 - and I'm gonna comment out these lines.
04:26 - And you can see it's gonna draw that
04:28 - same four squares that we just
drew, okay, just like that.
04:32 - But by using a loop, your
code gets a lot more clear.
04:37 - What if you didn't want
to run it four times?
04:38 - What if you wanted to run
it one million times, yeah?
04:42 - It would be a lot harder to write
04:44 - that out one million times,
04:45 - but it's really easy to
write one million in here.
04:48 - I think that's one million.
04:50 - That's 10, 100, 1000,
04:54 - 10,000, 100,000,
04:56 - 1,000,000. That's actually 10 million.
04:59 - So there you go, 10 million.
05:02 - So this thing is gonna
run 10 million times.
05:05 - If I ran it, and I'm gonna
close it really quickly
05:08 - cause this is gonna keep running forever,
05:10 - but you'll notice that
it just keeps overlapping
05:13 - on the same square and it's gonna do that
05:15 - 10 million times so if I went to sleep
05:17 - and woke up this will
probably still be happening
05:20 - and then it'll still be
happening after that.
05:23 - So let's exit that before
something crazy happens.
05:29 - Okay, so that's loops for you guys.
05:33 - That is it for this video,
05:35 - I will see you in the next video.

Cleaned transcript:

Okay, so now that we've talked a little bit about functions with their arguments and also a little bit about functions with multiple arguments, this naturally leads us to the next thing. What if I want to make that one square but I want to make it multiple times? Sure, I can copy it and paste this line and paste it again, right, and then paste it again, so and and so forth. So, for example, let's try having it pasted twice. I'm gonna remove these comments here, and just so you remember, this 50 goes in for the length, it replaces every part of the length with 50. This 90 goes for the angle, it replaces every angle with 90. That's how it works, okay. So let's go back real quick and simply run this now. Okay, so I'm gonna hit the shortcut key to run it.
