00:00 - hey you what is up how's it going this
00:02 - is Kazi from clever programmer calm in
00:04 - this video I want to talk to you about
00:06 - why coders or programmers burn out and
00:11 - how to avoid that in your life this is
00:15 - something that can impact you in your
00:18 - career as a programmer it could stop you
00:21 - from getting the job of your dreams it
00:23 - could stop you from becoming the
00:24 - programmer that you want to become and
00:26 - it destroys people's potential and
00:29 - career as a programmer so with that said
00:32 - and without any further ado let's jump
00:35 - right into it
00:37 - what is programmer burnout what is a
00:40 - what is burnout in general well burnout
00:42 - often times as grant cardone says I was
00:45 - gonna say I say but grant cardone says
00:46 - this he says you're not tired you're
00:48 - uninspired and burnout rarely ever
00:52 - happens because you're overworking
00:54 - because most people don't work that much
00:56 - and they don't actually push themselves
00:58 - to that limit most times
01:00 - burnout actually happens because people
01:03 - feel uninspired they're either doing the
01:05 - same thing over and over again or
01:07 - they're constantly getting frustrated
01:09 - and hitting a roadblock and that's the
01:11 - one thing that they're getting stuck by
01:13 - and so what happens when you keep
01:15 - getting stuck well eventually you will
01:17 - give up you will get uninspired and you
01:20 - will not want to move on so the one
01:22 - thing that can help you really break
01:24 - past any of these barriers and get
01:26 - virtually guaranteed that you're never
01:28 - gonna have a burnout is by setting
01:30 - really tiny little goals along the way
01:34 - to where you're trying to get to
01:36 - oftentimes I'll see some new programmers
01:38 - coming in and they're like you know I
01:39 - want to build the next Facebook I want
01:42 - to build the next Instagram I have this
01:43 - crazy idea too big of an ask too big of
01:47 - a task and when this start obviously
01:49 - they can't build it they're not ready
01:51 - oftentimes they give up they're burnt
01:53 - out now for other people the burnout
01:56 - happens even if you're big even if
01:58 - you're past a beginner right you're
01:59 - coding you're building projects but then
02:02 - eventually you forget what your goal is
02:05 - what you're doing and you kind of quit
02:07 - or give up so how does it work for me
02:10 - for example I'm gonna be competing in a
02:12 - powerlifting
02:13 - a petition in may May 25th is getting my
02:15 - first powerlifting competition to get to
02:18 - that I'm trying to make sure that I keep
02:21 - hitting everyday I increase my weight by
02:24 - two and a half pounds five pounds
02:26 - because I'm still in like the beginner
02:27 - face so I can keep making those gains
02:29 - and I have very systematic step-by-step
02:31 - things that cause me to win every day so
02:34 - when we bring it back to programming you
02:36 - need to set up these small incremental
02:38 - goals where you're winning every single
02:40 - day so let's say your job you're you do
02:43 - want to build an Instagram clone or you
02:47 - do want to build the next Facebook well
02:49 - you got to break it down what does a
02:51 - face what does Facebook have well you
02:54 - know I've talked about these topics
02:55 - before but I think it's really good to
02:56 - reiterate because as humans we need
02:58 - reminders all right like know why do we
03:03 - keep looking up how to stop
03:04 - procrastinating because all we need is
03:06 - reminders why do we need motivation just
03:08 - to be reminded and get back in that zone
03:10 - again okay so this is why I keep
03:12 - reiterating this so much but okay so
03:14 - let's say we want to build Facebook now
03:16 - just to break Facebook down into its
03:18 - component parts it's not just Facebook
03:20 - and boom that's it
03:23 - all right that's not actually what it is
03:26 - right when you're working on Facebook
03:29 - you need what is Facebook made of well
03:32 - we have login functionality so that's
03:35 - one we have log out functionality what
03:39 - else do we have do we have the ability
03:41 - to make a post yes so we can create
03:44 - posts we have a database that can store
03:47 - all the posts so when you create them
03:49 - and you log back into your account all
03:51 - your posts are saved somewhere it's kind
03:54 - of like a massive Excel spreadsheet so
03:56 - we need a database all right what else
04:01 - do we need after a database well we need
04:03 - to have a way we need to actually show
04:05 - this and make this look nice so we need
04:07 - to know HTML plus CSS if we're trying to
04:12 - make a clone of it okay
04:14 - we're not gonna be copying all of the
04:15 - technologies that are using let's say
04:17 - we're trying to build this with Python
04:18 - so what are what are we going to need
04:20 - well we need HTML and CSS to make
04:22 - Facebook look nice make it
04:25 - pretty okay what else do we need besides
04:27 - html/css well we need to know django so
04:31 - we can actually have something that
04:32 - speaks between all this pretty crap and
04:34 - the database okay so django just allows
04:38 - you in simple terms allows you to do
04:41 - that okay it allows you to speak between
04:43 - these two okay we got django and we will
04:47 - also need of maybe a few other
04:49 - technologies but let's just stop here
04:51 - for the sake of simplicity and not
04:54 - turning this into a technical exactly
04:56 - how do we make facebook but more so what
04:59 - is the general idea what's the message
05:01 - that i'm trying to get across here so
05:03 - when you're learning stuff one of your
05:07 - goals is to figure out how do you build
05:10 - a login logging in functionality all
05:13 - right oh we also have to upload this
05:15 - online right somewhere so maybe you need
05:17 - to know a technology like Heroku alright
05:20 - okay or digitalocean something where you
05:22 - can actually host this website online
05:24 - now you need to know login functionality
05:27 - that's kind of the first thing you need
05:29 - to know so i would start working on how
05:31 - does login functionality work or maybe
05:34 - i'll start with let me learn HTML CSS so
05:37 - then i can make a website look pretty so
05:38 - then when I build my Facebook clone I
05:40 - can make it look beautiful and you learn
05:44 - each technology as you go and you
05:46 - implement alright so this is how I
05:48 - learned so let's say I wanted to build a
05:50 - Facebook clone when I learned the login
05:52 - functionality at some point I went ahead
05:55 - in my app and I added this functionality
05:58 - okay then when I learned the logout
06:01 - functionality I went and added it to my
06:03 - app then when I learned to create post
06:05 - functionality I added it to my app and I
06:07 - would keep doing this and because I
06:09 - didn't know Heroku at the time and I
06:11 - didn't know how online stuff work I just
06:14 - used a module like tech enter in Python
06:17 - which basically allows you to make
06:19 - graphical user interfaces so it stands
06:23 - for GUI GUI and when it allows me to
06:27 - make graphical user interfaces well this
06:31 - just allows me to do it locally that's
06:33 - the cool thing about tech enter so I
06:34 - don't have to learn about all this crap
06:36 - about how do you post
06:39 - I didn't have to learn about Django at
06:41 - that point I don't have to learn about
06:42 - html/css I don't have to learn about
06:44 - databases so basically it it makes it
06:48 - simple for me to learn without adding
06:50 - too many complications so first I just
06:53 - learned GUI I learned there was a tech
06:55 - intern module
06:56 - I built a login functionality with a
06:57 - decanter module I built a log out
06:59 - functionality with the tech intern
07:01 - module I be able to create post
07:03 - functionality with that module and then
07:05 - when I needed to take it online and I
07:07 - was kind of stuck and I needed to know
07:08 - these things that's when I started
07:11 - actually learning about these things
07:13 - another big secret I will give you so
07:16 - you are not stuck on really really
07:20 - stupid things and just smashing your
07:23 - head against the wall constantly and not
07:27 - making any progress because in coding
07:28 - sometimes you get stuck with the dumbest
07:30 - errors a lot of people will know if they
07:33 - if you've ever tried to post something
07:35 - up online using Heroku you'll run into
07:37 - you stupid 500 internal service errors
07:40 - that don't help you at all improve your
07:43 - coding skills you'll not know what it is
07:45 - it'll turn out to be some small little
07:47 - bug and it will take you about let's say
07:49 - one week to figure out with five to
07:51 - eight hours a day of debugging very very
07:54 - painful and a total waste of your time
07:56 - so one secret I'll give you are coaches
08:03 - so what do you do what would I do here I
08:05 - would go to code mentor dot IO which is
08:09 - the online platform where there are
08:12 - mentors you pay them they help you there
08:15 - live it's almost like going to a pizza
08:17 - shop you ask for a pizza to give you
08:19 - Pizza you need help with code they help
08:21 - you with code right away and I used to
08:23 - have a mentor and her name is Jessamine
08:25 - she is in absolute killer badass she's
08:29 - usually always books I don't know if
08:31 - you're gonna get her or not
08:32 - but if you are going from this video
08:34 - message her that I sent you she's not
08:37 - gonna give you a good deal she might but
08:39 - she will definitely think that I'm
08:41 - awesome for doing that but yeah please
08:43 - let her know she loved that knowing that
08:45 - you're coming from me and she'll
08:46 - probably prioritize you higher I don't
08:48 - know but she's super awesome and she
08:51 - helped me a lot when I would when I used
08:53 - to get stuck with my coding problems and
08:55 - what would happen is like she'll just
08:57 - tell me right away what's the best
08:59 - resource and in what order should I go
09:01 - to add this database to my tech
09:03 - inter-app okay so for example she might
09:05 - just tell me hey right now don't add too
09:08 - much complication of adding online
09:09 - functionality just build a local
09:11 - database using like Excel spreadsheet or
09:13 - a CSV file and with your graphical user
09:16 - interface that'll work then later she
09:19 - might tell me okay now it's time for you
09:21 - to learn HTML and CSS and she would just
09:23 - guide me on the right track and save me
09:26 - countless hours on stupid errors not
09:29 - intelligent errors not the errors were
09:32 - reading debug them you increase your
09:34 - skill I'm talking about you lose your
09:37 - brain cells debugging some of these
09:40 - problems okay so those are the bad
09:42 - problems to debug that I'm talking about
09:44 - and you know this woman has saved me
09:48 - years of my life there are some other
09:50 - mentors that I hired from code mentor as
09:52 - well that helped me a lot but she was
09:54 - definitely my favorite just to wrap it
09:56 - up how do you avoid coders or
09:58 - programmers burnout you one have a big
10:01 - goal and to you you break that goal down
10:05 - into small component parts and then you
10:07 - learn those parts okay three you apply
10:11 - each of those things that you're
10:12 - learning to one of your projects and
10:15 - your apps this way you are implementing
10:18 - and taking action as you go and the
10:21 - fourth secret that I gave you is if you
10:23 - have a mentor when you're stuck you can
10:26 - literally go to a platform called code
10:28 - mentor dot IO they're coders on demand
10:31 - they can just help you right away and
10:33 - then you can move on with your life okay
10:36 - if you can't afford somebody who's
10:38 - charging higher prices like 30 or 60
10:40 - dollars an hour look for somebody who's
10:42 - charging $10 or $15 an hour and if even
10:45 - that's tough message them and say hey
10:48 - can we work something out
10:49 - that's the message for this video I hope
10:52 - that you enjoyed it if you did please go
10:54 - ahead and give this a little thumbs up
10:56 - really helps the channel we're trying to
10:58 - make this we're trying to grow this
11:00 - channel massively and we're trying to
11:03 - create like one video a day for you
11:05 - guys if not - that's our goal but the
11:07 - way we can do that is if you support
11:09 - this channel and the super easiest way
11:11 - for you to support this channel is
11:12 - honestly just giving you a thumbs up
11:13 - then YouTube will put it in front of
11:16 - more people the more people that view it
11:18 - the more people will come into the
11:20 - clever programmer community and you're
11:23 - gonna keep getting tons of more videos
11:25 - and all we need from you is just the
11:26 - little thumbs up with that set thank you
11:28 - so much for watching subscribe to the
11:29 - channel if you haven't already

Cleaned transcript:

hey you what is up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm in this video I want to talk to you about why coders or programmers burn out and how to avoid that in your life this is something that can impact you in your career as a programmer it could stop you from getting the job of your dreams it could stop you from becoming the programmer that you want to become and it destroys people's potential and career as a programmer so with that said and without any further ado let's jump right into it what is programmer burnout what is a what is burnout in general well burnout often times as grant cardone says I was gonna say I say but grant cardone says this he says you're not tired you're uninspired and burnout rarely ever happens because you're overworking because most people don't work that much and they don't actually push themselves to that limit most times burnout actually happens because people feel uninspired they're either doing the same thing over and over again or they're constantly getting frustrated and hitting a roadblock and that's the one thing that they're getting stuck by and so what happens when you keep getting stuck well eventually you will give up you will get uninspired and you will not want to move on so the one thing that can help you really break past any of these barriers and get virtually guaranteed that you're never gonna have a burnout is by setting really tiny little goals along the way to where you're trying to get to oftentimes I'll see some new programmers coming in and they're like you know I want to build the next Facebook I want to build the next Instagram I have this crazy idea too big of an ask too big of a task and when this start obviously they can't build it they're not ready oftentimes they give up they're burnt out now for other people the burnout happens even if you're big even if you're past a beginner right you're coding you're building projects but then eventually you forget what your goal is what you're doing and you kind of quit or give up so how does it work for me for example I'm gonna be competing in a powerlifting a petition in may May 25th is getting my first powerlifting competition to get to that I'm trying to make sure that I keep hitting everyday I increase my weight by two and a half pounds five pounds because I'm still in like the beginner face so I can keep making those gains and I have very systematic stepbystep things that cause me to win every day so when we bring it back to programming you need to set up these small incremental goals where you're winning every single day so let's say your job you're you do want to build an Instagram clone or you do want to build the next Facebook well you got to break it down what does a face what does Facebook have well you know I've talked about these topics before but I think it's really good to reiterate because as humans we need reminders all right like know why do we keep looking up how to stop procrastinating because all we need is reminders why do we need motivation just to be reminded and get back in that zone again okay so this is why I keep reiterating this so much but okay so let's say we want to build Facebook now just to break Facebook down into its component parts it's not just Facebook and boom that's it all right that's not actually what it is right when you're working on Facebook you need what is Facebook made of well we have login functionality so that's one we have log out functionality what else do we have do we have the ability to make a post yes so we can create posts we have a database that can store all the posts so when you create them and you log back into your account all your posts are saved somewhere it's kind of like a massive Excel

super awesome and she helped me a lot when I would when I used to get stuck with my coding problems and what would happen is like she'll just tell me right away what's the best resource and in what order should I go to add this database to my tech interapp okay so for example she might just tell me hey right now don't add too much complication of adding online functionality just build a local database using like Excel spreadsheet or a CSV file and with your graphical user interface that'll work then later she might tell me okay now it's time for you to learn HTML and CSS and she would just
