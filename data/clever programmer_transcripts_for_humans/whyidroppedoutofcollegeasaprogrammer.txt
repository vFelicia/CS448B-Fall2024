00:12 - (hype music)
00:21 - - Hey you what is up?
00:23 - How is it going?
00:24 - This is Qazi from cleverprogrammer.com
00:26 - In this video I'm going to talk about
00:28 - why I dropped out of
college as a programmer.
00:33 - So without any further ado,
lets jump right into it.
00:37 - There are many factors to this.
00:38 - I recently made a video called,
00:40 - "do I need college to
become a programmer?"
00:43 - Which is a great video.
00:44 - You should check it out we'll
pop it up here somewhere.
00:46 - With that said, I do wanna talk about
00:49 - the pros and the cons of college.
00:53 - And when you should decide
which route you need to go.
00:57 - Okay, some I'm gonna talk about all
00:58 - those concepts in this video.
01:00 - First of all, I'm gonna start off with,
01:03 - you have to know why it
is that you are actually
01:06 - going to college in the first place.
01:10 - That's something important for
you to actually understand.
01:12 - Because if you are trying to,
like I said in my other video,
01:15 - trying to become a doctor
or a lawyer then you might
01:18 - need college and you might need
01:20 - the degree otherwise it's impossible.
01:22 - Right you need to have that bar exam
01:24 - as a lawyer to become a lawyer.
01:27 - Now when it comes to computer programming.
01:30 - If you're trying to
become a data scientist.
01:32 - It helps to have a degree.
01:34 - A lot of data scientists have their PhDs.
01:37 - But if you're trying to
become a full-stack developer,
01:39 - a front end developer,
a back end developer.
01:42 - Now look if you wanna become a doctor
01:44 - or a lawyer you're probably
gonna need to go to college.
01:48 - But if you wanna become a web developer,
01:50 - a full stack developer,
a front end developer,
01:52 - maybe it's not so necessary.
01:54 - Right? When it comes to programming.
01:57 - So it depends on what
you are trying to do.
02:02 - But I think, what's deeper to
understand about this question
02:06 - or this video topic if you're
clicking on and watching it
02:09 - and you're thinking "why did
Qazi drop out of college?"
02:12 - my hunch is you're trying to
figure out what might justify
02:16 - it for you to drop out of college.
02:18 - And what are the conditions
02:20 - where you can make that decision,
02:21 - because it's a very important
decision of your life.
02:23 - It one of the most important
decisions of my life.
02:26 - I dropped out of college after I went
02:28 - about two and a half years.
02:30 - I went to a community college,
Oakton community college,
02:33 - for two years.
02:34 - Then I went to UIC, which
is a university in Chicago,
02:37 - and I essentially ended up dropping out
02:41 - of that after going there for 1 year.
02:43 - The biggest point that I
want to get across here
02:46 - for you is earn your
way out of college okay?
02:53 - Please don't feel privileged
enough to just pack
02:57 - your shop and drop out
at some random point.
03:00 - Understand that you actually need
03:02 - to earn your way out of it.
03:04 - So what do I mean by that?
03:05 - If you're considering
dropping out and you're like,
03:07 - "Hey there are a lot more
practical things I could do
03:10 - in the real world I can
work on real world projects,
03:13 - get real experience instead of maybe
03:15 - sometimes just learning theory."
03:17 - Well, don't just pack up
your shop and drop out.
03:20 - The first thing you need
to do is prove to yourself
03:23 - that you're capable of
surviving on your own.
03:26 - Personally, for me why I
dropped out was because
03:29 - I started getting free
lancing opportunities
03:31 - and I was already doing
software development work
03:35 - outside of college while
I was going to college.
03:38 - I had other developers who started working
03:40 - under me as well that I started managing.
03:43 - I hired them from Upwork
and then I managed them.
03:46 - They were brilliant developers,
03:48 - they were really good
and I was the middle man
03:51 - between them and the client.
03:52 - Because I was a good enough programmer.
03:55 - And then I could just handle
the clients expectations
03:59 - and I could handle communicating between
04:00 - the software developers to make sure
04:03 - the project was moving forward.
04:04 - What ended up happening
was I was started to earn
04:07 - over six figure income while
I was going to college.
04:11 - And then I remember my professor at UIC,
04:17 - my computer programming professor,
04:20 - he came up to me and he
started asking me about
04:24 - career advice and he actually sent
04:27 - me an email as well asking about that.
04:29 - So I thought, okay if my
professor is asking me
04:32 - about career advice then
maybe it might be a good time
04:36 - for me or maybe it's a sign that
04:38 - I'm already doing something right.
04:41 - So I thought, let me
just take one semester
04:44 - off and start pursuing this on my own.
04:46 - But please keep in mind
that I was already earning
04:48 - enough I didn't just randomly drop out.
04:52 - So it also depends on
your level of tolerance
04:56 - to say how much risk you can handle.
05:00 - Some people are really risk averse.
05:02 - Ahem, ahem Aaron.
05:03 - No I'm kidding, he's right there.
05:05 - He likes to play it a little safe.
05:07 - So maybe for him it's
better to go to college
05:11 - and he would still go
on to kick ass in life.
05:13 - For me, I had just a different
way of going about things.
05:18 - Everybody has their own way.
05:19 - So decide what works for you.
05:21 - That's really important.
05:22 - But for me it was, if I'm
working on end of projects
05:25 - already and I'm making an income,
05:28 - maybe I can just drop out.
05:30 - So I took one semester off.
05:32 - In that semester off I wanted to see
05:33 - how I would do on my own.
05:35 - And also my channel, Cleverprogrammer,
05:37 - it started to get a few more subscribers.
05:40 - I wasn't making any money off of it,
05:42 - but it started to get more subscribers.
05:44 - Okay, because I already
have clients and have
05:48 - already figured it out
then I'm gonna be safe.
05:50 - And that's kinda what
happened in that semester
05:52 - off I started earning more income,
05:54 - I started getting more
software developing jobs
05:56 - And my channel was also growing more.
05:59 - At that point I decided.
06:01 - I believe January of 2017
was where I really decided
06:08 - I was going to be dropping
out of college completely.
06:12 - So that's when I really decided,
06:13 - when things were already taking
off I was getting results.
06:16 - I survived two or three
months after taking a semester
06:19 - off and then I said
okay so January of 2017,
06:23 - I'm like around that time.
06:25 - January or February is where I decided
06:26 - Okay cool, I'm gonna
drop out at this point
06:30 - because I think I can handle myself.
06:32 - I am able to not only survive, but thrive
06:35 - and I essentially ended up
dropping out of college.
06:39 - Also, I found mentors
who I was learning from.
06:46 - So for me it's also really
important to understand
06:49 - that school is just one
resource you learn from.
06:54 - When I talk about dropping out of college
06:57 - and why it helped me so much.
06:58 - People think I'm pro not being
educated, being stupid, no.
07:05 - That's not what I'm promoting.
07:08 - I am learning every single day.
07:10 - And for people who're
learning on their own
07:13 - every single day and you're self-taught.
07:15 - Which I know a lot of
you have the capability
07:17 - of doing and a lot of you probably are.
07:19 - Who are learning programming and who are
07:20 - getting into this field.
07:22 - You've even shown enough interest
07:23 - to watch this video on your own.
07:25 - Which 90% of the world
isn't ever gonna do.
07:27 - You can start to-
07:28 - Once you're learning on your own,
07:30 - then you just start to see
college as one resource
07:35 - where you're getting a little
bit of your knowledge from.
07:37 - That's essentially it.
07:38 - So if you're learning on your own.
07:39 - Making progress, growing every day then
07:41 - it's not really necessary right?
07:44 - But if you're somebody who is not learning
07:46 - on your own everyday and
that's your only place
07:49 - you're learning from
then you kinda need it.
07:51 - Right, because if you don't go then
07:52 - you're not going to become anybody.
07:54 - You're just going to be useless in life.
07:56 - Those are my thoughts on why I dropped
07:58 - out of college as a programmer.
08:00 - Please understand just to recap.
08:03 - Earn your way out of college, number one,
08:08 - which is the most important point.
08:09 - So prove to yourself while you're going
08:11 - to college that you can actually drop out.
08:14 - And two, you need to see
which field you're going in.
08:20 - If their is a field that
guarantees that you cannot
08:24 - get a job without a degree then
08:28 - you need to probably get a degree.
08:31 - But for example people who become,
08:33 - let's say if you want to
become a cinematographer,
08:37 - you want to become a videographer,
08:39 - you want to become an editor.
08:41 - You could go to school and get a degree
08:44 - and you will learn really
well and you'll be amazing
08:46 - You could also get jobs on your own.
08:51 - Right, so that's one field
where whether you get
08:53 - a degree or not you'll
still be able to find work.
08:56 - So just pick and choose figure
out in programming world,
09:00 - what are the fields that need a degree
09:02 - and then go from there.
09:05 - With that said thank you
so much for watching.
09:08 - If you liked this video,
give it a little like.
09:11 - It really helps out the channel.

if you haven't already.
09:21 - And as always I love your face and I'll

09:27 - If you want to become
a developer that makes
09:30 - an impact in the world.
09:32 - And you want the freedom to
work from wherever you want,
09:36 - I've put together an epic, unbelievable,
09:39 - three part master class.
09:41 - It's absolutely free.
