With timestamps:

00:00 - as much as you hear me say or other
00:01 - people say end of programming it might
00:03 - not be 5 to 10 years from now now even
00:05 - when we say end of programming it really
00:07 - might be the end of traditional coding
00:09 - jobs and how they look where you have
00:11 - software developers sitting there
00:12 - writing code it's going to morph into
00:14 - you becoming a project manager or a
00:17 - product manager who's going to be
00:19 - writing to AI to build things and you're
00:21 - going to be overseeing it like you have
00:23 - a bunch of Junior developers under you
00:25 - and then when there are bugs you might
00:26 - go and check it out and see what what's
00:27 - happening but the bugs are going to be
00:29 - start being less and less likely as time
00:31 - goes on as it starts to get better and
00:32 - even debugging it might actually not be
00:34 - you coding debugging it might be giving
00:37 - it instruction letting it debug hey why
00:39 - did you start it on port 8080 you should
00:41 - have started on Port 7000 hey why we
00:44 - using mongod DB we needed you to use
00:46 - Firebase for this you know that that
00:48 - level of debugging kind of like you
00:49 - would when you're interacting with the
00:51 - developer so coding is an exciting time
00:53 - you should still learn it it's
00:55 - incredibly valuable but start using
00:57 - these AI tools and Chad GPT tools that
