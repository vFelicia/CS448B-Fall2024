00:04 - hey guys how's it going this is Kazi
00:07 - from clever programmer dot-com so in
00:13 - this video which is if we're gonna be
00:16 - talking about your fastest roadmap to
00:19 - becoming a Python freelancer okay and if
00:24 - you got my email and hopefully nothing
00:27 - goes wrong
00:29 - hi Kishori roll was the first one
00:33 - yeah I'm sorry guys so today we started
00:36 - the live broadcast a little bit late as
00:37 - well but let me just say what we're
00:39 - gonna be covering so for those of you
00:40 - guys who joined early I don't want you
00:42 - to leave because I ramble on about
00:43 - something random so we're gonna be
00:45 - talking about your fastest roadmap to
00:47 - becoming a Python freelancer okay that's
00:49 - my goal for today and then we're also
00:51 - gonna be covering things like what
00:54 - happens to the job market after Jeff
00:56 - Bezos he recently bought out Whole Foods
00:58 - for 13.7 billion dollars and I think
01:03 - Jeff Bezos made like 20 billion dollars
01:06 - in five months that's the fastest
01:08 - anybody's ever made I think twenty
01:10 - billion dollars and he might actually
01:13 - catch up to Bill Gates and kind of you
01:16 - know go past him the other things that
01:21 - we're gonna be talking about is my
01:23 - three-step blueprint that I want to give
01:25 - you to go from become being complete
01:27 - beginner or maybe you're just starting
01:29 - out to becoming a Python freelancer
01:32 - whether you're currently doing a job
01:34 - maybe in some kind of administrative
01:36 - field or an IT field or you're a tech
01:38 - savvy person or you're just like
01:40 - interested in this job industry of
01:42 - software development alright okay
01:47 - and something else crazy is going on
01:50 - which is um apparently somebody's trying
01:54 - to steal my youtube channel which I
01:56 - wanted to show you guys but of course
01:58 - none of my computers are working my iMac
02:01 - died yesterday when it came for the live
02:03 - stream and now my laptop is acting up so
02:06 - I wanted to go out do the live stream
02:07 - for you guys from my laptop but I can't
02:09 - do that
02:09 - so here we are on my cell phone again
02:12 - which breaks my heart
02:15 - because it's just so annoying I don't
02:16 - know why that happens
02:18 - so yeah I won't be able to show you but
02:21 - yes I'm gonna try to tell you guys the
02:24 - name of the person who's trying to steal
02:26 - my channel and I kind of need your help
02:29 - because you know it takes a long time to
02:32 - build a channel you know it's like a lot
02:34 - of a lot of hard work like day in and
02:37 - day out like I work to build this
02:39 - channel up to where it is today probably
02:43 - like thousands of hours at this point
02:45 - you know I would go to college and then
02:47 - anytime I would come back I would go to
02:48 - work and then even though I was tired
02:51 - and exhausted I would come back and then
02:53 - I in that one hour or thirty minutes
02:55 - whatever I got free I would find time to
02:58 - make videos for this channel and for you
03:00 - guys and now somebody has literally
03:04 - taken all of my videos and has it on
03:06 - their YouTube channel and yeah and the
03:11 - CEO of repple it repl I T try to talk
03:16 - basically featured one of my videos one
03:20 - of my vlog or one of my like yeah one of
03:22 - my videos where I I'm doing an exercise
03:24 - and he thought he featured my channel
03:27 - but instead of my channel he ended up
03:31 - featuring the channel that stole all of
03:33 - my content so that person also got all
03:36 - the publicity for that post til later I
03:40 - got on a phone with the CEO of rebel dot
03:42 - it and then we talked for a while and
03:45 - then once he realized that that other
03:47 - you know guy was trying to like
03:49 - plagiarize all of my stuff he finally
03:51 - gave me credit okay so yeah I also want
03:56 - to give you guys the top three
03:57 - programming resources that I have used
04:01 - that have helped me become a software
04:03 - developer really fast start doing
04:05 - freelancing work gold from kind of
04:07 - scratch to doing real stuff so I want to
04:09 - kind of give you guys that they helped
04:12 - me learn the technical part you know and
04:14 - then the the soft skills part that
04:17 - actually helped me get the clients was
04:19 - mostly some of my mentors that worked
04:21 - really closely with me what you guys
04:24 - actually might know Nick I talked about
04:26 - him a lot
04:27 - also does anybody know if you guys are
04:30 - watching this right now does anybody
04:32 - know what happened to the live stream
04:33 - today because I had it set to remind
04:35 - everybody at 3 p.m. Pacific and that
04:41 - should be 5 p.m. Chicago time so I'm
04:43 - here at 5 p.m. Chicago time but I got
04:46 - some complaints of people saying that
04:48 - the Live cast show started earlier if
04:51 - that's true could you let me know
04:53 - because that doesn't make sense
04:56 - California Pacific time is 3 p.m.
04:58 - that's Chicago 5 p.m. time okay and then
05:02 - also I'm going to be taking your
05:04 - questions kind of live I'll take all
05:06 - your questions head-on so whatever
05:09 - questions you have or bring them on and
05:12 - then I'll try to answer them for you
05:13 - guys okay so this channel I wanted to
05:18 - kind of talk about I want to bring down
05:19 - this channel I really don't like you
05:24 - know this channel because they're
05:25 - they're stealing all of my content and
05:27 - it's called Quinn's Katherine qu IND
05:33 - space CA th er I and II if somebody
05:38 - could write that in the comments that
05:39 - would be great and if any of you guys
05:41 - get a chance just go and like flag it
05:44 - for having my content and that will be
05:46 - really good okay so let's start off with
05:55 - my simple you know blueprint for
05:59 - becoming a Python developer okay there's
06:03 - a really simple blueprint for this and
06:07 - here's what it is at a high level and
06:11 - again I wanted to show you guys in
06:14 - screencasts but I can't do that because
06:16 - my laptop and my computer died so you
06:19 - kind of start off a good job for getting
06:23 - the book I showed you yesterday you're
06:24 - taking action that's good so you want to
06:27 - start off with you know you're just a
06:30 - beginner so you start off by learning
06:32 - okay this is a very high level learning
06:35 - then the next thing that you need to do
06:37 - is you want to go and then you want to
06:39 - get to the middle
06:40 - which is like build projects and half
06:42 - things to put on your portfolio and then
06:46 - the last part over here right the last
06:51 - part over here is actually getting
06:54 - clients and knowing how to get clients
06:57 - the tricky part that happens though at
07:00 - the surface level is very easy you start
07:02 - you build then you find clients ok start
07:06 - build find clients three-step process
07:09 - fairly simple process the the real
07:13 - complexity that lies in between for
07:15 - example when do you know you are ready
07:18 - to get a client when do you know you're
07:21 - ready to start freelancing when should
07:23 - you stop doing the coding so before we
07:27 - get into the complexities of that if you
07:30 - guys have a pen and paper you know start
07:33 - writing this down because it'll be there
07:36 - for you and I have already mentioned
07:39 - this multiple times so if you guys if
07:41 - you guys ever hear me say something
07:42 - multiple times don't freak out because
07:45 - not everybody gets to hear it so that's
07:47 - why sometimes I repeat myself you know
07:49 - so I want to I want to make sure that
07:52 - everybody gets to know this so make sure
07:54 - you write down some of the top resources
07:57 - that are available online for free first
08:00 - of all clever programmer an amazing
08:02 - resource for Python right which is my
08:04 - channel and I have over 160 free videos
08:08 - for you guys on YouTube I have a course
08:10 - for you guys if you're looking for
08:11 - Python great place to start
08:14 - Coursera is another place very academic
08:17 - stuff but yeah Coursera is really good
08:20 - so you guys want to write that down if
08:21 - you're looking for resources write down
08:25 - Udacity another good resource Udacity is
08:29 - my personal favorite if I like ever
08:31 - found myself stuck that's the first
08:34 - place I go to because they make their
08:36 - courses a lot of fun they're really
08:37 - interactive and the videos are short and
08:40 - they focus on getting you to do some of
08:43 - the stuff hands-on yeah so Udacity is a
08:47 - little bit more fun and again Udacity is
08:49 - also free so you don't have to like pay
08:52 - anything
08:54 - and after Udacity you have then they're
08:58 - not in any particular order you have EDX
09:00 - EDX so write that down in the comment so
09:03 - other people could see it but EDX is
09:05 - basically whoops let me just double
09:10 - check some stuff here so yeah EDX is
09:18 - basically another one that's really
09:21 - academic and rigorous I'm not a huge fan
09:23 - of EDX except so one that's really good
09:28 - the course is really good on EDX I
09:30 - believe is cs50
09:32 - I think it's on EDX right yeah shouldn't
09:36 - you on EDX
09:36 - so there's a course called cs50 really
09:39 - good course except it's not in Python
09:41 - and you guys know me and I'm always
09:43 - talking about Python and the reason why
09:45 - I talk about it a lot so much is it's
09:49 - one of the easiest programming languages
09:50 - it's one of the most paid and it's one
09:53 - of the most popular right so that's why
09:55 - I mentioned Python a lot if you want to
09:59 - do Python cs50 is not going to be the
10:01 - course I would suggest to stick with
10:03 - Udacity and Coursera Coursera has
10:05 - introduced reactive programming in
10:07 - Python
10:08 - absolutely great course that's free of
10:10 - cost to you okay so with these courses
10:14 - you practice a lot right but what I want
10:17 - you guys to do is don't fall in the trap
10:19 - of gets really really high
10:22 - I should until you're slow python is
10:26 - slow Python Python makes you more
10:28 - productive
10:29 - that's what matters now it depends also
10:32 - what you're doing if you're making a
10:34 - game that is really really really
10:36 - dependent
10:45 - it says very bad connection for me
10:47 - can you guess confirm if it's indeed
10:49 - very bad connection I'm gonna try
11:02 - changing the connection here alright
11:11 - what I'm gonna try to do guys is I'm
11:13 - going to try to go from LTE mode to my
11:20 - to the Wi-Fi here but in the office of
11:23 - Wi-Fi is not so good so I'm going to
11:26 - give it a try for you guys okay
11:38 - okay now it should have connected to
11:43 - Wi-Fi if the connection is better let me
11:45 - know and then we can continue from there
11:48 - okay so what I was saying was you have
11:51 - all these resources that make you really
11:53 - good but a lot of the problem that I see
11:55 - is that people get really stuck on doing
11:57 - exercises that are a lot of the times
11:59 - meaningless and don't actually go
12:01 - towards helping you build a relevant
12:04 - experience that your employers or people
12:07 - who are trying to hire you or looking
12:09 - for and the reason why I say that's a
12:12 - problem is because okay so me when I
12:15 - started coding as you guys might know I
12:17 - spent fifteen hours a day coding and
12:20 - learning which is why I was able to just
12:22 - learn it so so so so so fast
12:24 - except now that I look back one of the
12:28 - biggest problems I had with doing that
12:31 - you know even spending 15 hours and
12:34 - learning FS I could have learned it way
12:36 - faster one of the biggest problems I had
12:39 - is I got stuck in doing stuff that
12:41 - didn't put something on my portfolio it
12:45 - was a lot of theoretical stuff that I
12:47 - was doing there was a lot of academic
12:48 - stuff that I was learning from you know
12:51 - web sites like Coursera code Academy EDX
12:54 - Udacity all of those right team
12:56 - treehouse but there wasn't a lot of
12:58 - stuff that was teaching me you know even
13:01 - if they had me build a project that I
13:02 - could put on my portfolio they never
13:04 - really talked about where to go to start
13:09 - doing freelancing when to go to start
13:11 - doing freelancing or suffer you know
13:14 - because we'd have a full-time position
13:15 - if that's your thing personally
13:17 - full-time positions are not my thing
13:19 - not I'm not huge on nine to five o'clock
13:22 - and Dan and day-out I'm big on choices
13:25 - so I'm gonna have the choice and I want
13:27 - to choose to work not only when I want
13:30 - but also with who I want because if I'm
13:34 - working with people that I don't really
13:36 - respect or they don't really respect me
13:39 - then I want to have the option to not
13:42 - work with them is that true for you guys
13:45 - you know would you guys want to be in
13:48 - that situation where that's true for you
13:50 - is this going offline because I'm guests
13:52 - getting messages that this is going
13:54 - offline what's up with that okay
14:05 - beautiful so this is what you want to do
14:08 - right you want to make sure that you
14:10 - practice coding you build the skills but
14:12 - don't get so caught up in all the
14:13 - technical stuff it's really good but
14:15 - then it can lead you down a wormhole
14:18 - where when the deeper that you go the
14:23 - more like the less competitive in the
14:27 - job market that you become okay so
14:31 - hopefully that kind of answers the
14:32 - question of how to go from one point to
14:36 - the next point which is how to go from
14:38 - just learning to building projects and
14:41 - having something to show okay and then
14:44 - the next part for you would be to go
14:45 - from building that thing and then
14:47 - looking out for more clients now I
14:50 - wanted to segue into Jeff Bezos does
14:56 - anybody know what's going on with Jeff
14:58 - Bezos okay who knows what's going on
15:04 - with Jeff Bezos so he just bought Whole
15:12 - Foods right and what does that probably
15:17 - mean for the job market like what's
15:23 - gonna happen to all the employees that
15:25 - are usually working at Whole Foods I
15:27 - have a feeling that a lot of this stuff
15:30 - is gonna get automated call me crazy but
15:34 - I have a feeling you're welcome Zachary
15:36 - but I have a feeling that a lot of this
15:39 - stuff is gonna get automated and what
15:42 - happens when things get automated when
15:46 - things get automated you need a lot of
15:48 - people who can take care of the
15:50 - automation and the people who usually
15:51 - are doing the automation or your
15:54 - developers your programmers your data
15:57 - scientists your engineers and all of
16:00 - those people need to be able to do
16:02 - program
16:04 - so whether you're a reason for computer
16:06 - programming is you're looking to make a
16:08 - complete career switch from where you
16:10 - currently are but another important
16:13 - thing for you know choosing programming
16:18 - is that you'll have more opportunity and
16:20 - you'll also be able to get a promotion
16:21 - where you currently work and become more
16:24 - competitive at your current job there
16:26 - are a lot of people even on the YouTube
16:28 - channel one of the students said he got
16:31 - a promotion at his current job yeah it's
16:38 - um I'm so sorry about this guys this is
16:41 - crazy I'm probably gonna get just a
16:43 - whole another studio with badass Wi-Fi
16:46 - or something like that because this is
16:48 - really frustrating that I'm trying to
16:50 - talk with you guys and you know it keeps
16:54 - cutting off because I sometimes lose my
16:57 - train of thought or you know I lose you
17:00 - some of you guys you guys drop out so I
17:02 - don't want that I don't want to give you
17:03 - a bad experience so yeah that's probably
17:06 - gonna happen very soon because this is
17:09 - crazy like my iMac stopped working then
17:12 - my computer stopped working and then my
17:13 - iPhone is the only thing that's working
17:15 - and then somebody apparently is stealing
17:18 - my youtube-channel wind Catherine qu ing
17:23 - CA th o e RI n e somebody who wants to
17:27 - write that in the chat please go ahead
17:29 - and do so and if you ever get a chance
17:31 - please go ahead and mark that as spam or
17:34 - mark that as copyright infringement
17:35 - because they're literally taking all of
17:38 - my videos all of my material okay so go
17:44 - ahead and do that now
17:46 - you guys also note that I am launching
17:48 - my course which is actually about to
17:50 - close tomorrow so there's one day left
17:53 - the course is called create apps with
17:56 - Python or Python olp create apps and
17:59 - essentially my whole point with this
18:02 - course and the reason why I made it is
18:04 - because of the same things that I had to
18:07 - deal with I went through doing crazy
18:09 - amount of coding crazy amount of like
18:12 - doing coding challenges problems going
18:15 - to academic route of learning
18:16 - have learned computer science and
18:18 - college at UIC
18:20 - I learned it from so many different
18:22 - professors have also taken courses on
18:25 - Linda and all these other platforms but
18:27 - the biggest problem I had was it was all
18:29 - academic it did help but it didn't help
18:32 - teach me how to get clients like for
18:35 - example I was charging almost twice the
18:38 - money that I was paying my personal
18:42 - mentor at the time because he was just
18:45 - not a good like he didn't know any soft
18:49 - skills for any business skills or
18:51 - anything that really made him somebody
18:53 - who could stand out from the crowd
18:55 - and he helped me in the room and one of
18:57 - the problems that happened was well
18:59 - first of all he just he would kind of
19:01 - stop right at the dot so if we had a
19:03 - one-hour session with him he would
19:05 - literally stop right at that one-hour
19:08 - session so this is something you guys
19:09 - can do with your clients as well okay
19:11 - with whether you get a client today
19:12 - tomorrow a few months or from years from
19:15 - now and whether it's in programming or
19:17 - anything else like you really have to
19:20 - take care of the people that are there
19:23 - with you and that are working for you
19:26 - the reason why I call people clients and
19:29 - not customers is is there's a difference
19:32 - between the definition right customer is
19:34 - somebody who buys something from you
19:36 - somebody who pays you for your services
19:39 - or your product whatever a client by
19:42 - definition is somebody who is under your
19:44 - protection so if you think like that you
19:47 - already start standing out from the
19:49 - crowd and when people work with you they
19:51 - don't want to work with anybody else
19:52 - because you really take care and watch
19:55 - out for them so that was one of the key
19:58 - things that I wanted to share with you
20:00 - guys and that was the key thing that
20:01 - made a difference for me in my
20:04 - freelancing life in my software
20:08 - consulting and I've seen that happen
20:10 - with lots of like good developers at all
20:14 - but the mentor that I had earlier that
20:17 - was one of his problems he would
20:19 - literally clock in right at the time
20:21 - that he was supposed to leave and he
20:23 - would do the least amount of work as
20:25 - possible and he would try to work with a
20:28 - lot a lot a lot
20:29 - of clients so for example he had I don't
20:32 - know like 40 people whereas some of the
20:36 - top people that I work with always had
20:38 - very few people that worked with but
20:40 - just took care of them a lot didn't get
20:42 - exhausted weren't frustrated by them and
20:45 - only chose to work with people that they
20:47 - found you know where there was mutual
20:50 - respect and those are some of the key
20:53 - things I will tell you whether you watch
20:55 - this video and leave right now you know
20:57 - shut it off close it down and then go on
21:00 - with your life this is something that
21:01 - will help you even if you are doing
21:04 - something in IT right now and you just
21:05 - continue doing that or if you're doing
21:07 - something in administration doesn't
21:09 - really matter this is kind of
21:10 - universally applicable yeah generator is
21:16 - yeah those are fun and Python you know
21:19 - you can you can do that and in my course
21:21 - that's you know some of the things that
21:23 - we cover and we build GUI applications
21:25 - which are graphical user interfaces
21:27 - because a lot of the times what problem
21:28 - that happens with students is that right
21:31 - now you may know how to code and you may
21:33 - not how to write like a random generator
21:35 - for words that can do yes or no but you
21:39 - guys a lot of the times don't know how
21:40 - you can take that code and I didn't know
21:42 - this as well and turn it into a real app
21:44 - something that people can click touch
21:46 - and move around right because the people
21:49 - who are using your applications they're
21:52 - not sitting in the command lines right
21:54 - trying to type some stuff what they are
21:57 - doing is they want to click buttons and
21:59 - move around and then do stuff right so
22:01 - for example when you go to a website or
22:03 - Instagram or Facebook wherever that's
22:06 - what you expect to do you're not sitting
22:07 - there in the codes what you're doing is
22:09 - you're literally clicking home you're
22:12 - clicking add a new friend blah blah blah
22:14 - right so that's exactly what you need to
22:18 - be able to do so you want to go from
22:21 - writing code because nobody really cares
22:24 - about just code but people do care about
22:28 - the results right that end results kind
22:33 - of what you have there at the end which
22:38 - is going to be an app or a project
22:40 - something like that
22:42 - Kazi i'ma Coalition has lost Python for
22:45 - my degree also to learn Java how does
22:47 - Python apply to Java different languages
22:50 - overlap Python doesn't really have like
22:52 - such a amazing overlap with Java Python
22:55 - can overlap with JavaScript you know
22:58 - HTML and CSS is not really a programming
23:00 - language but Python goes really well
23:02 - hand-in-hand with HTML CSS Python goes
23:05 - hand in hand with sequel SQL Java mmm no
23:11 - like they don't really go hand-in-hand
23:12 - but you know the concepts overlap
23:14 - because computer science daniel says i'm
23:23 - curious how much you make well even when
23:25 - I was like 20 21 I was making about
23:27 - $10,000 a month and a little over
23:30 - $100,000 a year that I was bringing in
23:34 - so yeah I've never relieved
23:37 - I've always just been crazy in terms of
23:41 - being able to figure out how to get work
23:44 - but more importantly how to bring value
23:46 - to the people that I work with you know
23:48 - I I really I'm crazy sometimes I'll lose
23:51 - business because of how insane I am and
23:53 - when I mean insane I just mean that if I
23:57 - think you're doing a wrong thing I'll
23:58 - tell you even if it hurts your and my
24:01 - relationship if I think you're gonna
24:03 - throw yourself down somewhere I'm not
24:05 - just gonna shut up and let you do it
24:06 - which is why a lot of the times are
24:08 - people that end up not working with me
24:10 - but then the people who do end up
24:13 - working with me we have a really good
24:15 - relationship you know obviously you have
24:17 - to be somewhat political and try to make
24:19 - sure that everybody is kind of okay and
24:21 - you're not just being extra aggressive
24:23 - for no reason but that's you know one of
24:26 - those things I'm 22 years old right now
24:28 - CG so yeah but yeah I just really care
24:32 - about the people that I work with and I
24:34 - really care about what I do and I'm not
24:37 - afraid to ask for the price that's right
24:40 - you know ask for what I deserve to be
24:43 - paid or ask for less than that because
24:48 - that's one of the problems that happens
24:50 - with a lot of people that I see is that
24:51 - you are better than you think you are
24:54 - like a lot of you guys right now
24:55 - probably getting underpaid I guarantee
24:58 - you like yeah somebody just asked me for
25:02 - a one-on-one I pretty much don't do them
25:04 - anymore I'm almost gonna stop doing one
25:07 - on once because it's just it's um I was
25:15 - gonna say it's time-consuming but that's
25:16 - not really what it is I'd rather spend
25:18 - time for everybody that's that clever
25:20 - programmer you know now we have over
25:22 - 30,000 students at clever programmer so
25:24 - I want to spend time for you know with
25:27 - everybody so with that said I'm gonna
25:29 - work less one-on-one but I can almost
25:32 - guarantee that if i sat down with almost
25:34 - any of you guys right now one-on-one I
25:36 - could help boost you by ten twenty
25:39 - thousand dollars a year like easy a lot
25:43 - of you guys I mean obviously there are
25:46 - some people who are like way better at
25:47 - this than I am so I'm not trying to like
25:49 - brag but a lot of the times what happens
25:51 - is people just leave money on the table
25:53 - and there are certain simple things that
25:55 - they don't know like in the United
25:57 - States we almost think it's a bad thing
25:59 - to negotiate when it's not negotiation
26:03 - is one of the most important things you
26:04 - should be doing here I'll give you a tip
26:06 - that will give you a return on
26:07 - investment of just watching this for 26
26:09 - minutes never accept the first offer
26:12 - like when you guys apply for a job
26:14 - you'll get the first offer and then
26:16 - you'll just go oh my god it you know
26:18 - you're excited or whatever it is and
26:20 - you're thinking I'm not gonna get this
26:21 - again you go for it almost never do that
26:24 - just one of my friends recently got an
26:26 - offer for about $40,000 and I convinced
26:30 - him do not accept it he was excited out
26:32 - of his mind because he got to work as a
26:33 - developer and I said do not do that
26:36 - ask them for sixty thousand dollars
26:39 - twenty thousand dollars more we're sorry
26:42 - sixty-five thousand dollars was twenty
26:44 - five thousand dollars more and he did he
26:47 - wrote this long email ask them for
26:49 - twenty five thousand dollars more and
26:50 - guess what happened they said no but
26:54 - with a big butt like Nicki Minaj no I'm
26:57 - kidding this said we're gonna put you at
27:00 - sixty thousand dollars so think about
27:04 - that twenty minutes or 30 minutes of my
27:08 - trans-time just got him twenty thirty
27:11 - thousand dollars extra what does that
27:13 - mean that almost made him money that was
27:17 - one year kind of ahead right now that
27:21 - money was literally how should I say it
27:24 - saved him one year right that would have
27:27 - that would take him two years to make
27:30 - that money yeah Nicki Minaj oh my god
27:32 - have you guys heard her new song
27:33 - something about fraud I yeah I couldn't
27:36 - even pay attention to the freaking song
27:37 - I just love her so a lot of the times
27:45 - that's what it is that's why a lot of
27:48 - people just focus on the technical
27:50 - aspect but and it's good but you do you
27:53 - do do kind of need to be doing this
27:56 - stuff and it's not hard I promise you
27:59 - guys and I teach you guys this in the
28:01 - course I will literally all I will also
28:05 - be adding new content to this course
28:07 - constantly like non-stop it's called
28:09 - Python Opie create apps if you guys are
28:11 - watching this video and you're curious
28:13 - click on the link below and just check
28:15 - it out but I will be adding more content
28:17 - to this and I will be showing you guys
28:19 - exactly even what to say to you know
28:23 - keep a client or if you're working with
28:25 - a client how can you increase that price
28:27 - with that have an ongoing relationship
28:29 - how can you go about firing a clients I
28:32 - know a lot of you guys can't see
28:34 - yourself right now in that position of
28:35 - having a client because you're kind of
28:37 - just starting out so that might not be
28:38 - something that's realistic
28:40 - Kanako awesome man that's great that you
28:43 - joined this course I'm excited to have
28:45 - you I know you guys can't see herself
28:47 - there yet but that's okay you know I've
28:49 - helped enough people do this that I know
28:52 - that it's just like a repeatable process
28:55 - you know success it's just something
28:57 - that you see somebody have it and you
28:59 - follow what they do so it for everybody
29:01 - depends you know for example for Mira
29:03 - meets a team Iraq cause Gary Vee grant
29:05 - cardone and I try to follow what they do
29:07 - and that helped me in my business it
29:09 - helped me get clients all that stuff
29:12 - this is these are the kind of skills and
29:15 - things that I show you in this course in
29:16 - the start we're gonna be working in the
29:18 - course on becoming a better programmer
29:20 - so I'm
29:21 - be teaching you principles helping you
29:23 - master Python okay Cassie how and where
29:30 - will we get real projects to make back
29:32 - the money so in the course outline how
29:37 - can you start making back the money and
29:38 - I also talked about when you are ready
29:40 - to start freelancing there's one
29:43 - important thing that happens that is
29:45 - yeah you can even go on up work and find
29:47 - clients you know and it's not you know
29:50 - you can go on up work and find clients
29:52 - right upward calm there's freelancer
29:54 - calm that's no secret but the problem
29:56 - that happens is how do you end up
29:58 - landing the client how do you know
30:00 - you're ready to start freelancing with
30:02 - them and more importantly how do you
30:04 - actually stand out from the crowd right
30:07 - at clever programmer I actually have
30:10 - multiple software developers that
30:12 - actually work for me have two software
30:13 - developers we have a marketing
30:15 - development representative we have
30:17 - virtual assistant we have a business
30:18 - consultant and all of these people I
30:21 - have hired and I literally and I have a
30:24 - video editor as well so I interview
30:26 - people all the time I go through meza
30:28 - maze all the time and these are you know
30:30 - there are a lot of questions that I ask
30:31 - in there that I think are important and
30:33 - when I go through their CV or their
30:35 - resume there are many things that are
30:36 - important and I've got good at
30:38 - identifying to know whether somebody's
30:40 - bullshitting or if somebody's right and
30:43 - has the right practical skills to
30:45 - actually be able to do the job and those
30:47 - are some of the things that I want to
30:48 - show you guys in this course because a
30:52 - lot of the times it doesn't take you
30:54 - that long to become successful like you
30:56 - just go with for the people who are
30:58 - there and then learn that process and so
31:01 - it saves you you know years of your time
31:03 - something that's supposed to take you
31:04 - years you can actually end up doing it
31:06 - in months Daniel in the course there's
31:10 - no reason for me to other languages
31:12 - because I don't want to just teach you
31:14 - multiple languages which is a lot of the
31:16 - thing a lot of the times what a lot of
31:18 - academia does and then you can't get a
31:20 - job because all you know is just a bunch
31:22 - of different languages so I don't want
31:26 - to just make you go here make you go
31:29 - there and then just have your head
31:30 - spinning for no reason and that's the
31:32 - problem with a lot of the courses they
31:34 - have a lot of
31:34 - content a lot of crazy content to make
31:36 - it into like 20 hours so then they can
31:39 - be like hey look you know you paid for
31:41 - this course and this is what you got so
31:42 - I'm not a big on giving you guys 300
31:45 - hours of material I want to give you
31:47 - guys little material but that gets your
31:50 - results faster okay I want to make this
31:53 - clear that this is not you know
31:55 - something that you just sit there and
31:57 - watch and it just automatically happens
31:59 - you have to make active you can have to
32:01 - work and put in the work and follow the
32:04 - stuff that I have outlined for you guys
32:06 - ask questions on the group and yeah then
32:09 - the results are there for you okay so
32:12 - that part is kind of tricky right when
32:14 - you go from mastering programming and
32:17 - then to freelancing when do you know
32:19 - you're ready to go there and those are
32:22 - the things I teach ok so again I have my
32:30 - oh my god we lost so many people I'm
32:33 - sorry guys so I have my phone on this
32:35 - one thing worse when somebody joins the
32:37 - course it kind of goes it makes a call
32:40 - to me and tells me the name of the
32:42 - person who joined so then what happens
32:44 - is it ends up going offline the live
32:47 - stream goes off so I'm just sorry about
32:49 - that like that just sucks but it's
32:52 - pretty cool you know now I get I get to
32:54 - tell you guys that who joined let's see
32:59 - [Music]
33:01 - Essen nice welcome Essen good job I have
33:06 - it under not disturbed but when I get to
33:08 - calls it ends up doing the call Austin
33:12 - nice let's see who else we got we got
33:16 - John joint that is great all right let
33:23 - me see if I can find some of the reasons
33:25 - why some of these students joined and
33:28 - [Music]
33:29 - tell you guys I'm you know what I'm
33:31 - saying okay so essen joined because he
33:36 - says he would like to build a portfolio
33:37 - quickly to show potential clients and
33:43 - employers working useful apps yeah so
33:47 - this course
33:48 - teach you how to build your own apps
33:50 - from complete scratch graph with
33:52 - graphical user interfaces things that
33:56 - people can click and touch and play
33:58 - around with and this course will show
34:01 - you those things I'm also adding new
34:03 - material to this course which will cover
34:05 - some web development fundamentals
34:07 - meaning that when you guys build this
34:08 - stuff you can show it to everybody
34:10 - around you we're gonna be specifically
34:12 - we're gonna be covering some of the
34:14 - flask framework and Python and I'll show
34:17 - you guys how you can build an app with
34:19 - Python that anybody can use I'm gonna be
34:22 - using the same tools that people use to
34:24 - build YouTube and Instagram and Yelp
34:27 - okay actually Yelp I don't think they
34:29 - use Python but read it does okay so I'm
34:31 - gonna be showing you guys some of those
34:33 - tools and I'm gonna be adding new
34:35 - content to this course so anytime I add
34:39 - any more content to the course you guys
34:41 - have access to it free of charge I don't
34:44 - charge you a cent
34:45 - when I add new content the last time I
34:48 - made this course available and I closed
34:51 - it down March 23rd since then the price
34:55 - has tripled yeah so the price has
34:59 - tripled since the last time I launched
35:01 - it and if after I closed it down now the
35:05 - price will likely increase again because
35:07 - there's just so much more content that I
35:09 - keep adding to this course you know it's
35:11 - made from the heart I spent a lot of
35:13 - time a lot of blood and sweat making
35:16 - these courses again I saved this quite
35:18 - often but I'm not trying to do this like
35:21 - some old instructor that's teaching you
35:22 - on udemy behind a PowerPoint who is just
35:26 - making that course so he can pay his
35:28 - bill
35:35 - okay so what tools are needed for the
35:38 - course and are there any additional cost
35:39 - that's a very good question Cassie and
35:41 - there are no there's no additional
35:46 - material that you need and everything is
35:48 - free of cost so I show you how to
35:50 - install Python and that's pretty much
35:52 - all that you need and if you need to get
35:54 - something like sublime text that's also
35:56 - free of cost and I show you in the
35:58 - course exactly how to download it in all
36:00 - of that so that is not a problem pretty
36:04 - much there's no dependency like you
36:06 - don't need to have taken any course
36:07 - before this it's a complete fit for
36:09 - beginners if you're a complete beginner
36:12 - or you've been doing Python for a few
36:14 - months this course is for you if you've
36:16 - been doing programming for years I'm
36:18 - gonna be honest this course is not for
36:20 - you
36:21 - you're too advanced sublime text is not
36:27 - paid if you want to pay then you can but
36:31 - you can also use it for free yeah you're
36:33 - welcome Cassie again I'm big on getting
36:39 - results on big on actually becoming an
36:41 - effective developer that gets worth that
36:44 - gets client I'm not big on just teaching
36:46 - you techniques you know I can do that
36:49 - and I always wanted to do that but you
36:53 - know I want to do something for you guys
36:55 - that gets you real results and as fast
36:57 - as possible then I'm sure you guys will
36:59 - be down to learn all the nerdy
37:01 - because then once you're making money
37:03 - the nerdy stuff will actually make even
37:05 - more profitable which is that happen
37:07 - which is what happened to me when I
37:08 - learned about intra relational databases
37:11 - and I got better at them right now
37:15 - they're about I would say probably are
37:18 - almost ten hours of content and then I'm
37:20 - going to be adding more content to the
37:21 - course so it's gonna end up being more
37:24 - than ten even just this next week you
37:28 - guys are going to be getting lots of
37:29 - videos on flasks and we're going to try
37:31 - to build something with flasks so yeah
37:33 - you guys are going to have more than ten
37:36 - hours of content there okay BSS try
37:41 -  or no sequel I don't know
37:43 - Pet pet I don't know what that means
37:45 - what do you mean BS but yeah
37:48 - I don't know why you want to try manga
37:50 - or no sequel like databases databases
37:55 - the database like unless you're doing
37:56 - something very specific or niche it
37:58 - makes sense or you're doing something
38:00 - that's very high-performance maybe make
38:02 - sense but not really
38:05 - relational databases are okay a lot of
38:08 - things are built on relational databases
38:09 - Oh simple programmer just hit a hundred
38:16 - k subs that is crazy
38:19 - yeah I wanted to catch up to him and
38:21 - beat him but I guess he is
38:23 - there ahead of me he is there ahead of
38:28 - me the main the main point for this
38:30 - course is to help you guys make that
38:32 - transition there's no course that shows
38:34 - you how to make that transition from
38:35 - your current job your current work to
38:38 - the world of programming a lot of them
38:41 - just tell you to quit if you try to join
38:43 - the programming bootcamp what happens
38:45 - you have to pay like fourteen thousand
38:47 - dollars up front and then you have to
38:49 - quit your job and just do that
38:52 - programming bootcamp for I don't know
38:54 - like three months six months and then
38:57 - hope that you get a job whereas with
38:59 - this it works within your schedule so if
39:02 - you're already doing a job and you have
39:03 - a family or whatever right even if
39:06 - you're single that's completely fine you
39:07 - have to still pay your bills so I don't
39:11 - want you to just let go what you're
39:12 - currently doing I want to make it so you
39:14 - can do it within your current job spend
39:16 - hours on this and work on this get
39:18 - practical knowledge practical real-world
39:21 - product have the knowledge to build
39:23 - real-world projects and then I want to
39:25 - help you make that transition so my main
39:27 - focus in this course is to help you earn
39:30 - an income while you're actually learning
39:34 - and mastering Python okay and then once
39:38 - you've mastered it and you can start
39:39 - freelancing with clients so that's my
39:41 - main goal so to make it easy for you
39:44 - guys to make that switch as fast as
39:46 - possible
39:51 - all right sweet we just had Jennifer
39:54 - join Jennifer welcome on board let's see
40:00 - why some of the other students join
40:02 - Michelle I have been interested Michelle
40:08 - says I have been interested in learning
40:10 - Python also my husband has been learning
40:13 - Python but I had a hard time getting to
40:16 - a point where he feels like he actually
40:17 - knows something I have been encouraging
40:20 - him to do projects and thought this
40:23 - sounded like the perfect opportunity if
40:24 - he could learn to do projects and make
40:26 - money so he can quit his nine-to-five
40:28 - then that would be perfect thank you for
40:31 - making the program so that is Michelle's
40:35 - reason Thank You Michelle for joining
40:37 - this is it's very exciting to have you
40:39 - on yeah Congrats ji Taber for joining
40:44 - and Congrats eat a diaper for joining
40:50 - guys I'm sorry on what I'm gonna have to
40:51 - do is I'm gonna have to turn off this
40:53 - thing that gives me a call the forty
40:56 - seven dollars extra is for the
40:58 - mastermind group the slack channel where
41:01 - there are other students they're
41:03 - available and you have access to me as
41:06 - well it's pretty much free and here's
41:11 - why I know forty seven dollars quite a
41:12 - bit but here's the thing when you work
41:15 - with a developer you pay one hundred a
41:16 - hundred fifty dollars an hour and that's
41:19 - a lot of money right and it's not
41:21 - recorded and you can't do it exactly
41:22 - whenever you want you can only schedule
41:24 - them a lot of the times once in a week
41:26 - so with this the idea is that you have
41:29 - access to us in your back pocket so
41:32 - think of it as your emergency hotline
41:34 - one you could use it just to learn and
41:37 - collaborate and network with everybody
41:38 - too if you get a client and you're kind
41:40 - of getting screwed you don't know what
41:42 - to do or you can't help them you can't
41:43 - figure it out you can reach out to us in
41:45 - the slack Channel and the community

45:19 - moved here when I was younger who
45:21 - somebody just asked that oh did you do
45:23 - the punch this course is not so much
45:29 - about game development though you can
45:32 - use the principles to then do game
45:34 - development like we do make some basic
45:36 - stuff John again for the money back you
45:43 - can contact me or you can contact Rachel
45:46 - pretty much anybody and I have my email
45:48 - there for you guys at all the times
45:54 - I would say learn the basics learn and
46:00 - master a specific programming language
46:02 - and then go from there but there are a
46:04 - few good books on game development I
46:06 - can't think of them yet for some reason
46:09 - but if you're looking to start off on
46:11 - like just learning the technical parts
46:14 - of Python or you just want to kind of
46:16 - supplement it you know use this that
46:20 - would be really good and some of you
46:22 - guys are saying hey we sent out an email
46:25 - guys it takes us a little bit to get
46:27 - back to you because there are a lot of
46:28 - new students that are joining the
46:30 - program now so we promise we'll get back
46:33 - to all of you I see all of your emails
46:35 - as well but there's a lot of people that
46:37 - I'm trying to reply to on Facebook on
46:40 - YouTube there are a lot of emails I'm
46:42 - trying to reply to and then going
46:44 - through this whole launch and course
46:46 - closing it's a little bit hectic so
46:48 - please bear with me
46:50 - I'm not trying to ignore anybody you
46:51 - will get a reply back and I will try to
46:54 - get back in touch with you as fast as
46:56 - possible
46:57 - okay so don't worry all your emails are
47:00 - coming to the right places we're getting
47:02 - your emails and we are going through all
47:04 - of them systematically but our main
47:06 - priority is anybody who is new and joins
47:09 - we want to make sure that they get the
47:11 - course they get situated and if they get
47:14 - the mastermind group then they're
47:15 - actually enrolled in the mastermind
47:16 - group and so that ends up taking more of
47:19 - the time but we'll get around to
47:21 - everybody okay yeah and thank you Rachel
47:39 - okay guys yeah so if you guys have any
47:44 - questions and stuff now would be a good
47:46 - point I want to take on your questions I
47:52 - want to share the course structure but
47:56 - I'm stuck on my phone because my laptop
47:59 - is not working and my iMac is not
48:01 - working so this is what I have my phone
48:05 - and then my internet dies so kind of a
48:08 - sad thing
48:09 - ooh nice so we got few more students who
48:15 - join this is amazing and yeah so while
48:18 - you guys ask questions I'll also read
48:20 - you guys off why some of these people
48:22 - are joining and maybe some of you some
48:25 - of these guys resonate with where you
48:26 - guys are now and I'll also tell you
48:30 - these people should be in the course so
48:32 - let's see okay kanya konyaku joined and
48:41 - Tania Co said to develop another career
48:45 - besides my degree and improve my job
48:47 - prospect so Kanako is actually in I
48:51 - think on the live chat as well
48:52 - hi can yakko and that's a great point
48:57 - basically being able to develop an
49:00 - alternative career so you can also have
49:03 - a backup so huge deal congratulations
49:06 - I'm very excited to have you on board
49:09 - and I hope you love this course it's
49:11 - just the best course like that's what it
49:13 - is it's pretty simple alrighty let's see
49:19 - let's see
49:23 - oh this is very specific goodness um
49:35 - okay I'm gonna try to go through this
49:37 - and give you guys the gist of what this
49:39 - person is saying because it's pretty
49:43 - long so I'm gonna do that and I'll show
49:45 - you guys my laptop so then you guys can
49:47 - see that I'm actually doing something
49:49 - and I'm busy look at that
49:51 - so yeah this laptop is apparently you
49:55 - need OBS to broadcast on YouTube and I
49:58 - didn't have it on his lap this laptop so
50:00 - didn't want to take the time to spend
50:02 - before going alright hidaya
50:05 - thank you for joining the course welcome
50:07 - onboard super excited to have you this
50:10 - is great you guys we have a lot of
50:12 - students in the slide channels we're
50:14 - going crazy because they're just joining
50:15 - it and there's a lot of buzz and
50:17 - excitement and this course you know it's
50:20 - take it on your own pace this course is
50:24 - lifetime access anytime anything new
50:27 - that it's yours there's no you know
50:29 - there's no really like you're gonna miss
50:31 - anything if you have work or whatever
50:36 - yeah and yeah somebody said learning is
50:39 - by trying and trying and trying I do
50:41 - agree with you because that's what I did
50:44 - to learn as well but I do also know that
50:46 - there are faster ways to learn just like
50:48 - I got to or reaching over a hundred
50:51 - thousand dollars a year and my income as
50:53 - a 21 year old right that's a lot faster
50:56 - than some of the people who reach it at
50:58 - a later age so there are always ways to
51:01 - like get to your goals faster and that's
51:03 - what I'm about so that's what this
51:05 - course is also about and I think you're
51:07 - gonna find it helpful
51:08 - I want to package things and get your
51:11 - results faster you can always look up
51:13 - other stuff and then put the pieces
51:15 - together but in my personal experience
51:17 - it just takes a little bit longer so
51:19 - that's really the point of this course
51:21 - alright reading this okay let's see
51:27 - [Music]
51:31 - just this weekend I came across your
51:33 - YouTube channel and have loved all your
51:35 - videos you really know how to hit the
51:37 - spot huh nice
51:43 - you're so right that all these online
51:45 - courses like code Academy udemy et Cie
51:48 - just teach you the technical and I
51:50 - always find myself unmotivated or stuck
51:52 - that's a good point
51:54 - I tried Python the first time this
51:57 - weekend and enjoyed it okay that's great
51:59 - to know
52:00 - so Nicholas just tried Python and he's
52:04 - trying to kind of quit his corporate job
52:06 - in Dubai and he's trying to join a
52:09 - nine-week boot camp in Copenhagen called
52:12 - label hone I don't know I'd actually say
52:14 - it so I probably butchered the hell out
52:16 - of it now this this is yet so this
52:23 - course now one of the things that he
52:25 - says he's unmotivated and stuck and I
52:27 - find that happened to a lot of people
52:29 - and I found that happen to a lot of my
52:31 - friends as well
52:32 - they got unmotivated and then they kind
52:35 - of quit and that happens all the time
52:37 - and I want to make sure that doesn't
52:39 - happen to you that's why I try to make
52:40 - all my courses with just a lot of love
52:43 - interactivity and fun you know when you
52:46 - look at my course you'll see what the
52:47 - hell I'm talking about when you look at
52:49 - this you're gonna be hard-pressed to
52:51 - find something that is you know made
52:53 - with more love just the truth Udacity is
52:57 - a competition but I think that we can
53:01 - probably beat Udacity at this point and
53:05 - then another thing he says that he wants
53:06 - to quit his job and again that's really
53:09 - what I'm all about you know making that
53:10 - switch I was talking to you guys earlier
53:11 - about you know some people are trying to
53:13 - join the boot camp and then they are
53:15 - giving up everything that they're
53:17 - currently doing and it's such a huge
53:19 - investment this does it in a quicker way
53:22 - for example and it does it in a smoother
53:24 - way so you don't have to just completely
53:26 - go berserk and quit your job because I
53:30 - also try I also actually was part of a
53:32 - boot camp
53:33 - that's called thankful I have done
53:34 - everything so
53:42 - okay so to learn more about this and you
53:46 - want to check out this course click the
53:47 - link in the description it should be
53:49 - there
53:50 - it's called Python olp create apps so
53:53 - the link should be something like clever
53:55 - programmer dot two slash create apps
53:57 - with Python guys some people are having
54:00 - trouble finding the link so could you
54:02 - please do me a favor and copy and paste
54:04 - the link in the chat don't oh yeah I
54:06 - don't think it'll allow you to actually
54:08 - paste the link nevermind because I think
54:10 - YouTube thinks it's spam so just go in
54:13 - the description and then try to click on
54:14 - it and check it out and learn more about
54:16 - it for those of you who guys are
54:19 - wondering why should i I'm really
54:20 - interested in this course
54:22 - why should I join it today or tomorrow
54:25 - for two reasons one because then Ruhlman
54:28 - is closed tomorrow and then i don't know
54:30 - when i'm gonna launch it again probably
54:32 - a few months after at least two or three
54:34 - months and then the second reason is
54:37 - that when I launch it the next time it's
54:40 - going to be I can almost guarantee that
54:41 - it's going to be more expensive than it
54:43 - is this time because when I launched it
54:45 - last time in March 23rd you know since
54:48 - then the price has now tripled so
54:52 - because there is so much so much more
54:55 - content that is always added and that
54:58 - you know it's made there are so many new
55:00 - things that are added to it that's why
55:02 - it increases in price okay so I'm gonna
55:06 - read this all right so Nicholas says I
55:09 - I'm super excited to start your course
55:13 - as I would very much like to transition
55:17 - to a freelance work style to free up
55:19 - time for family friends and travel
55:21 - perfect being able to join pretty much
55:26 - at any you know any point shashi you
55:29 - keep asking me what's the structure of
55:31 - the course if you click the link to the
55:34 - course page that has all the details for
55:37 - you so if you click the link it's not
55:39 - like it's just gonna buy the course
55:40 - automatically it's gonna take you to the
55:41 - course page with all the details so you
55:44 - go in there and then it talks about it
55:46 - and if you still have questions I got
55:47 - you no worries no worries don't don't
55:49 - apologize it's okay
55:50 - if you still have questions I'll be here
55:52 - to answer you but the course you know
55:54 - covers things like when are you ready to
55:56 - start freelancing what are the three
55:58 - things that are stopping you from
55:59 - becoming a software developer how can
56:02 - you start making that transition even if
56:04 - you still have a job and then there's
56:07 - other technical stuff right like how to
56:09 - do object-oriented programming how do
56:11 - you make graphical user interfaces and
56:13 - Python how do you make applications that
56:15 - are visual how do you take code that
56:18 - garbage I mean I love code I don't wanna
56:20 - call it garbage that's disrespectful and
56:22 - so how do you take something that's just
56:24 - code and written text and turn it and
56:27 - turn it into an application that people
56:29 - use okay so I also show you that so yeah
56:34 - there are a lot of details on the page
56:36 - and that goes over it all right
56:39 - coding really is the most important
56:41 - skill to know nowadays I'm currently in
56:43 - sales and marketing Wow then realize
56:49 - most of our partners are not able to
56:51 - blah blah blah from that point on I knew
56:53 - coding was everything oh wow so
56:58 - basically what happened was he was doing
57:01 - okay so check this out
57:03 - I'm currently sales and marketing for a
57:05 - five-star hotel here in Dubai and just
57:07 - when I joined we had launched a super
57:09 - duper stupid laptop I swear amazing
57:15 - offer and spend hundreds of thousands of
57:17 - dollars marketing sending distributing
57:20 - and then realized most of our partners
57:23 - are not able to load this offer as it
57:25 - was not compatible with their systems
57:28 - mall lol so I Ricardo so what is he
57:37 - saying he's saying that there was this
57:39 - deal that was supposed to happen it was
57:40 - supposed to be hundreds of thousands of
57:42 - dollars and then what happened their
57:44 - systems didn't work they were incapable
57:46 - of making this happen why did this
57:49 - happen because the people who are
57:51 - working to make this happen lack the
57:53 - right coding skills yeah they only have
57:57 - money no brains and no good developers
58:00 - so somebody who can do a deal of
58:03 - hundreds of
58:04 - thousands of dollars do you really think
58:06 - they would have trouble like one of
58:07 - their deals is that expensive do you
58:09 - think they would have trouble paying you
58:11 - 50 60 70 thousand eighty thousand
58:13 - dollars a year right they would not when
58:18 - that's just one of their deals so that's
58:22 - a huge huge thing to kind of hear about
58:28 - and again you know with Jeff Bezos
58:31 - taking over Whole Foods scan and goes
58:33 - taking over Walmart
58:34 - it's things are headed in the direction
58:37 - of the software development field Loren
58:42 - James asks about payment options payment
58:44 - options are not available with paypal
58:47 - but I think you can do PayPal credit it
58:49 - has one of those like built in you can
58:53 - do payment option otherwise so I have a
58:55 - three month payment plan for you guys
58:57 - and then also have one-time payment or
58:58 - you can pay with PayPal so I try to make
59:01 - it simpler for you guys
59:08 - oh wow good catch so apparently somebody
59:12 - said YouTube doesn't think it's a
59:14 - hyperlink oh wow this is really really
59:16 - good to know thank you let me go check
59:20 - this and see what's going on hmm
59:23 - interesting interesting huh apparently
59:29 - my computer says that I'm not even
59:33 - streaming I swear everything is just
59:40 - like broken I have no idea why it's
59:47 - making me so sad guys I'm trying to
59:49 - figure it out it's just giving me
59:51 - anxiety over here this life stuff is
59:56 - crazy
60:04 - okay I have no idea how to fix that cuz
60:07 - it's just not working
60:10 - crypto says since I can't afford your
60:12 - one on one is it worth getting computer
60:14 - science theater I always think it's
60:16 - worth getting somebody to do one-on-ones
60:19 - with you always
60:23 - it just helps make it it just helps make
60:26 - it happen so much faster whatever it is
60:29 - so for example I've been you know I was
60:32 - doing coding I've always had mentors now
60:35 - they have just gotten from beginners to
60:37 - like really professional level right so
60:39 - meaning they weren't beginners but they
60:41 - had just built ok stuff now at work with
60:43 - like top of the line programmers and
60:46 - some of these guys are charging 150 to
60:49 - $200 to $250 an hour so these get a
60:53 - little bit more expensive but if you're
60:54 - starting out you don't need those guys
60:56 - there are a lot of people who will still
60:58 - help you for $20 an hour $30 an hour
61:01 - when I was switching from what I was
61:03 - doing earlier I would make all the money
61:05 - on my job and then use that money to pay
61:07 - for mentors and then basically what I
61:10 - did is I traded the skill that I had in
61:13 - my previous job for getting a new skill
61:15 - of Python and programming
61:25 - this is hilarious Zachary I think he's
61:28 - one of the students who's joined the
61:29 - course earlier and he says Thank You
61:31 - Kazi and sport spired me to learn Python
61:34 - and now I'm addicted haha and then he
61:37 - says I'm just so broke I can't afford
61:39 - schooling I'm just learning on YouTube
61:41 - as if no and then he says I tried
61:42 - sitting in on some classes at the
61:45 - University but they caught and and
61:47 - caught on and told me to get out I
61:49 - mainly sit at the library on campus and
61:51 - try to find like-minded people so really
61:55 - good way to go if you don't want to get
61:56 - a mentor you don't want to spend that
61:57 - money font work to find one-on-one
62:01 - people that was one of the things that
62:02 - has helped me as well i joined a meetup
62:05 - comm group and i would go there all the
62:06 - time and then i found one of the best
62:09 - mentors and his name is nick and he
62:12 - didn't charge me a cent and he helped me
62:14 - because he saw my passion I was doing 15
62:16 - hours a day and I'm going nuts doing
62:19 - computer programming literally had bags
62:21 - under my eyes but then you know he would
62:24 - help me and he was my mentor he showed
62:27 - me the way he showed me how much to
62:29 - charge I would ask him you know where
62:33 - should I go to apply so I can get more
62:35 - work mmm
62:37 - how should I keep that relationship
62:38 - going with my clients you know
62:40 - so those things super helpful
62:46 - he says crypto says I want to be a
62:48 - computer engineer would you say it's
62:49 - worth learning a lot of Python no
62:53 - because programming
62:55 - I want to specced emphasize this that
62:57 - it's not about learning a specific
62:59 - programming language and being really
63:01 - good at it it's learning the concepts
63:03 - and being really good at them and then
63:04 - you can switch to another language for
63:06 - example I can pick up a new language
63:08 - like go or something I haven't tried
63:12 - much Ruby in probably two days and be
63:16 - okay at it and then obviously become
63:18 - better at it the more I practice it so
63:20 - once you have some expunge you
63:23 - understand how programming works and you
63:25 - understands the concepts then it's much
63:27 - much much easier to become better at
63:29 - picking up new things so focus on
63:34 - learning the concepts
63:41 - okay guys yes
63:46 - try make mistakes learn from them and
63:49 - grow those are some of the best ways for
63:51 - you to improve your skills okay those
63:54 - are tried and tested in my course Python
63:58 - olp create apps my whole point is to
64:01 - make that a shorter path for you
64:04 - to get you to make that transition to

67:22 - don't know if you guys can read that
67:31 - yep and then algorithm design and
67:37 - recursion is not super exciting yeah you

70:20 - have you rusty says that's me
70:23 - yep that's you nice Nam are just joined
70:27 - welcome on board and Lauren just joined
70:31 - cool that happened very quickly the
70:36 - course details are in the link and short
70:40 - the course is about mastering Python by
70:43 - building real-world stuff so you can you
70:46 - can get hands-on work right we're gonna
70:48 - be doing stuff that's pretty hands-on
70:50 - and fun and interactive to follow I'm
70:52 - not hiding behind a PowerPoint I'm right
70:55 - there with you guys building this
70:56 - together and then more importantly I am
71:00 - also teaching you guys stuff that you
71:02 - can start putting on your portfolio or
71:04 - giving you ideas of projects that you
71:06 - can start to build on your portfolio
71:08 - okay that's what I'm about I'm not into
71:11 - passive learning
71:12 - I'm not into me teaching you the entire
71:14 - time I'm into teaching new stuff that
71:17 - you need to do okay so I'm gonna give
71:20 - you the basics and then you get it done
71:22 - and then you have results to show for it
71:26 - I hate go because I've personally hated
71:29 - having to go through lots of courses
71:33 - where I at the end didn't have anything
71:35 - to show for it
71:36 - okay so I don't want to do that for to
71:40 - you guys where you guys are going
71:42 - through you know all my all my courses
71:46 - and then you guys won't have anything to
71:48 - show for it at the end I don't want to
71:50 - do that for you guys that's why even my
71:52 - course called learn Python by building
71:54 - projects which is a freak
71:55 - which is on YouTube it's called learn
71:57 - Python you guys are building projects in
72:00 - there the whole time like 150 videos
72:03 - that I have they're also focused on
72:05 - helping you learn while building stuff
72:07 - so yeah so I wanna have you show
72:11 - something for it and then I want to help
72:12 - you get clients so what do you do
72:14 - between mastering Python and getting
72:17 - freelancing work there's a step in the
72:19 - middle that's missing that's what I show
72:21 - you in the course to make that jump to
72:23 - become a freelancer and to know you're
72:25 - ready to be a freelancer how can you
72:27 - start earning an income before you can
72:30 - start freelancing okay this is a very
72:32 - realistic way of looking at it because
72:34 - most people are just like why don't you
72:35 - just quit your job put your family and
72:37 - your money at risk
72:38 - put your bills in risk and just take
72:41 - this six months long programming
72:43 - bootcamp for $14,000 I mean it's kind of
72:47 - insane so I understand that for most
72:50 - people and what I want to do for you is
72:52 - help you make that transition even if
72:55 - you're at your current job and even if
72:57 - you don't have all the time in the world
72:58 - to take the course right so getting you
73:02 - the results in a faster way be COO if
73:08 - you send me an email with your address
73:11 - we'll ship you the book don't worry
73:12 - about it so it's very simple send an
73:15 - email to kasi at clover programmer calm
73:17 - and you know just say that you are you
73:22 - just joined the LP course we'll
73:25 - cross-reference if you have or not and
73:28 - then we'll send you the book okay very
73:30 - simple all right
73:35 - yeah just title just subject the thing
73:38 - like free book or books so then it's
73:40 - easier to kind of comb through that but
73:43 - I want to send you guys that okay yep I
73:47 - want to send you guys this kind of copy
73:50 - so I don't know if this is called soft
73:53 - coffee but this is what I want to send
73:57 - you
73:59 - okay all right so we're getting lots of
74:04 - students this is great let's see guys we
74:07 - got about how much how much time do we
74:12 - have seven more minutes right am i doing

74:22 - guys so whoever is joining within these
74:25 - seven minutes will get this book for
74:28 - free

75:14 - literally this person's name is mayor
75:17 - that's cool
75:25 - Jennifer says I joined this course
75:27 - because I want to get into programming
75:29 - and be able to create apps this course
75:31 - teaches you how to create apps with
75:33 - Python from scratch Glee apps that are
75:36 - gonna be on your computer and then later
75:38 - we're gonna do some web apps in this
75:40 - course as well where I'm gonna add for
75:42 - you guys so you can then share that more
75:44 - easily with your friends and family
75:45 - because a lot of the times you have this
75:47 - code but how do you actually make a
75:48 - graphical application link is in the
75:51 - description guys link is in the
75:53 - description if somebody's asking for the
75:55 - link could you guys please just send it
75:57 - in chat if you guys know it which is
75:59 - clever programmer to slash create - apps
76:01 - - with - Python alright Jennifer says I

76:13 - convinced me in joining clever
76:14 - programming welcome on board you are a
76:17 - clever programmer now I hope that you

76:45 - the lose win right I lose
76:48 - but you guys win and that's what I want
76:50 - to provide for you guys because that's
76:51 - I'm confident I am behind this course

77:01 - pocket okay yeah guys I'm not look like
77:04 - one person's money is not gonna like
77:07 - make the difference he
77:08 - for me you know I'm not gonna be like oh
77:11 - my god my main goal is to help you
77:13 - become a programmer make an impact like
77:16 - my personal goal is to have a hundred
77:18 - thousand people become professional
77:20 - programmers so that's really one of my
77:22 - biggest goals and I want to do that as
77:26 - fast as possible by making the best
77:28 - courses as possible cut the noise out
77:31 - for you guys you know that's kind of
77:32 - what drives me every day and that's what

77:47 - doubt so you get that and you get to
77:49 - keep this book so there are three
77:51 - minutes left if you get this course now
77:53 - you get the Python programming book
77:55 - which is you know one of the best books
77:57 - for a Python programming I'm a huge fan
77:59 - of it make sure to send me an email that
78:01 - says something about the book and that

80:02 - love that so yeah just relax in the chat
80:06 - you know enjoy yourself and let
80:07 - everybody else enjoy and don't be mean
80:09 - or troll people because guys we're all
80:13 - here to learn ok and improve our skills
80:17 - and become marketable right so that's
80:21 - the whole point
80:22 - a pet pet no you won't be met um me yes
80:28 - I still managed to find time for sleep
80:30 - that's actually one of the biggest
80:31 - things that I've been focusing on not
80:33 - just going crazy but actually finding
80:36 - time to do other stuff like for example
80:38 - now I'm focusing on going to the gym or
80:42 - I'm focusing more on doing jiu-jitsu
80:45 - focusing more on sleeping on time and
80:47 - not doing 20-hour days where I have bags
80:52 - under my eyes I'm just so scrawny you
80:55 - know that's not good and you guys
80:57 - shouldn't do that as well you know
80:59 - manage your time a little bit better I
81:00 - promise a lot of you guys have more
81:03 - hours in the day than you think the key
81:06 - the ultimate key to making your goals
81:07 - happen get a legal pad write down your
81:11 - goals and make them happen so for
81:13 - example I wrote down about 50 goals and
81:16 - I failed 49 of them and I succeeded in
81:21 - one and that one goal was actually
81:23 - clever programmer so you know it goes to
81:28 - tell you
81:29 - and now look this channel is a movement
81:32 - because if you guys right there are over
81:34 - at 50,000 subscribers going to hit
81:38 - hundred K and that is freaking amazing
81:41 - right so yeah write down your goals
81:45 - because a lot of the times will find
81:47 - yourself actually completing them so I
81:48 - had the goals of lifting becoming more
81:51 - fit eating better all of that and when I
81:54 - can see them in front of me it just
81:56 - meant turns me into a better person and
81:58 - here I'll tell you one thing they'll
82:00 - help you incredibly if you follow it I
82:03 - know it's like one of those old people
82:06 - things but trust me works really
82:08 - freaking well sleep around 10 p.m. and
82:12 - wake up around 4:30 a.m. or 5:00 a.m.
82:14 - like that alone will just change your
82:17 - life okay and when you sleep follow a
82:21 - REM cycle so REM cycles work in one and
82:23 - a half hours so one and a half hour or
82:25 - three hours four and a half hours and
82:27 - six hours so your quality of sleep
82:29 - matters more than your quantity so
82:31 - instead of sleeping for five hours four
82:33 - and a half hours will actually be better
82:35 - for you okay so try to do that sleep
82:39 - early wake up early and it will make a
82:42 - huge difference for you you'll find like
82:44 - how you got all this extra time that you
82:47 - didn't even have I'm personally a night
82:49 - owl and oh sorry I forgot to announce
82:55 - guys sorry before I keep going I forgot
82:58 - to announce that the time actually has
83:03 - passed but since I didn't announce it
83:04 - I'm gonna actually say if you joined in
83:06 - the next minute I'll still give you that
83:08 - book ok so literally I'm putting a timer
83:10 - on it right now so I don't forget ok I'm
83:12 - not I just didn't announce it so I feel
83:15 - bad for anybody who missed it ok so
83:16 - let's see 50 more seconds right now
83:20 - alright I'm gonna take on some of your
83:22 - guys's questions in the meantime so if
83:25 - anybody joins the program in this time
83:28 - join us Python I hope you create apps
83:30 - smoke is yours my friend
83:37 - okay so be cou says is there any way to
83:41 - sod the way to get the book is if you
83:43 - join the course within the next 50
83:45 - seconds so do that is there an easy way
83:50 - to become better at syntax I have a
83:52 - video online that's called top 4 tips
83:54 - for computer programming beginners that
83:56 - will help you check it out all right
83:59 - guys we have another student we got
84:00 - Kevin in the game Kevin is in the house
84:03 - welcome Kevin super excited to have you
84:05 - my friend Kevin also joined the group
84:09 - okay great
84:12 - so some students are joining the group
84:14 - and their reason is that even if they
84:16 - can connect with just one like-minded
84:18 - other student they can then work
84:20 - together to build a portfolio or they
84:22 - can work together to look for jobs or at
84:25 - least do emergency hotline kind of thing
84:27 - where if you have a client and you can't
84:29 - help that we can't figure it out you can
84:31 - go to the mastermind group or are the
84:34 - private slack Channel you can ask for
84:36 - help so you can ask me for help or you
84:37 - can ask other students for help I'm not
84:40 - always in that group but if you post a
84:42 - question in that group or you're talking
84:43 - that I do come by and watch it a lot of
84:47 - the times and if nobody can answer you
84:48 - then I'm there to answer you okay all
84:52 - right guys awesome the time is up for
84:55 - the book I try to extend it for you guys
84:57 - but that's it anybody who joins after
84:59 - 629 p.m. or you know 629 p.m. Chicago
85:04 - time there's no book so no book
85:15 - okay guys awesome this is already really
85:19 - long it's almost been two or three hours
85:21 - tomorrow I'm gonna go live one more time
85:23 - guys my course Python olp create apps
85:27 - helping you create apps from scratch
85:29 - build projects and press the clients and
85:32 - teaching you how to get clients most
85:35 - importantly this course shows you how
85:37 - you can start earning an income while
85:39 - learning and mastering programming in
85:42 - Python okay there's two paths you can
85:44 - take one is a very academic theoretical
85:46 - and you can become good at that that's
85:49 - one path to learn programming the other
85:51 - path is you can take which is
85:53 - project-based and you build stuff the
85:58 - first path is theoretical academic and
86:00 - leads to you earning exactly zero
86:02 - dollars
86:04 - the second path where you build projects
86:07 - have a portfolio that gets converted
86:10 - faster for you actually getting work
86:13 - that's exactly the reason why people
86:16 - graduate from college and for some
86:17 - reason they can't find work right and
86:19 - the problem is that they didn't have the
86:23 - applicable real-world skills to actually
86:25 - do a job they mostly had the skills of
86:28 - you know just do reticle stuff okay so
86:32 - that's all covered in this course I hope

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer dotcom so in this video which is if we're gonna be talking about your fastest roadmap to becoming a Python freelancer okay and if you got my email and hopefully nothing goes wrong hi Kishori roll was the first one yeah I'm sorry guys so today we started the live broadcast a little bit late as well but let me just say what we're gonna be covering so for those of you guys who joined early I don't want you to leave because I ramble on about something random so we're gonna be talking about your fastest roadmap to becoming a Python freelancer okay that's my goal for today and then we're also gonna be covering things like what happens to the job market after Jeff Bezos he recently bought out Whole Foods for 13.7 billion dollars and I think Jeff Bezos made like 20 billion dollars in five months that's the fastest anybody's ever made I think twenty billion dollars and he might actually catch up to Bill Gates and kind of you know go past him the other things that we're gonna be talking about is my threestep blueprint that I want to give you to go from become being complete beginner or maybe you're just starting out to becoming a Python freelancer whether you're currently doing a job maybe in some kind of administrative field or an IT field or you're a tech savvy person or you're just like interested in this job industry of software development alright okay and something else crazy is going on which is um apparently somebody's trying to steal my youtube channel which I wanted to show you guys but of course none of my computers are working my iMac died yesterday when it came for the live stream and now my laptop is acting up so I wanted to go out do the live stream for you guys from my laptop but I can't do that so here we are on my cell phone again which breaks my heart because it's just so annoying I don't know why that happens so yeah I won't be able to show you but yes I'm gonna try to tell you guys the name of the person who's trying to steal my channel and I kind of need your help because you know it takes a long time to build a channel you know it's like a lot of a lot of hard work like day in and day out like I work to build this channel up to where it is today probably like thousands of hours at this point you know I would go to college and then anytime I would come back I would go to work and then even though I was tired and exhausted I would come back and then I in that one hour or thirty minutes whatever I got free I would find time to make videos for this channel and for you guys and now somebody has literally taken all of my videos and has it on their YouTube channel and yeah and the CEO of repple it repl I T try to talk basically featured one of my videos one of my vlog or one of my like yeah one of my videos where I I'm doing an exercise and he thought he featured my channel but instead of my channel he ended up featuring the channel that stole all of my content so that person also got all the publicity for that post til later I got on a phone with the CEO of rebel dot it and then we talked for a while and then once he realized that that other you know guy was trying to like plagiarize all of my stuff he finally gave me credit okay so yeah I also want to give you guys the top three programming resources that I have used that have helped me become a software developer really fast start doing freelancing work gold from kind of scratch to doing real stuff so I want to kind of give you guys that they helped me learn the technical part you know and then the the soft skills part that actually helped me get the clients was mostly some of my mentors that worked really closely with me what you guys actually might know Nick I talked about him a lot also does anybody know if you guys are watching this right now does anybody know what happened to the live stream today because I had it set to remind everybody at 3 p.m. Pacific and that should be 5 p.m. Chicago time so I'm here at 5 p.m. Chicago time but I got some complaints of people saying that the Live cast show started earlier if that's true could you let me know because that doesn't make sense California Pacific time is 3 p.m. that's Chicago 5 p.m. time okay and then also I'm going to be taking your questions kind of live I'll take all your questions headon so whatever questions you have or bring them on and then I'll try to answer them for you guys okay so this channel I wanted to kind of talk about I want to bring down this channel I really don't like you know this channel because they're they're stealing all of my content and it's called Quinn's Katherine qu IND space CA th er I and II if somebody could write that in the comments that would be great and if any of you guys get a chance just go and like flag it for having my content and that will be really good okay so let's start off with my simple you know blueprint for becoming a Python developer okay there's a really simple blueprint for this and here's what it is at a high level and again I wanted to show you guys in screencasts but I can't do that because my laptop and my computer died so you kind of start off a good job for getting the book I showed you yesterday you're taking action that's good so you want to start off with you know you're just a beginner so you start off by learning okay this is a very high level learning then the next thing that you need to do is you want to go and then you want to get to the middle which is like build projects and half things to put on your portfolio and then the last part over here right the last part over here is actually getting clients and knowing how to get clients the tricky part that happens though at the surface level is very easy you start you build then you find clients ok start build find clients threestep process fairly simple process the the real complexity that lies in between for example when do you know you are ready to get a client when do you know you're ready to start freelancing when should you stop doing the coding so before we get into the complexities of that if you guys have a pen and paper you know start writing this down because it'll be there for you and I have already mentioned this multiple times so if you guys if you guys ever hear me say something multiple times don't freak out because not everybody gets to hear it so that's why sometimes I repeat myself you know so I want to I want to make sure that everybody gets to know this so make sure you write down some of the top resources that are available online for free first of all clever programmer an amazing resource for Python right which is my channel and I have over 160 free videos for you guys on YouTube I have a course for you guys if you're looking for Python great place to start Coursera is another place very academic stuff but yeah Coursera is really good so you guys want to write that down if you're looking for resources write down Udacity another good resource Udacity is my personal favorite if I like ever found myself stuck that's the first place I go to because they make their courses a lot of fun they're really interactive and the videos are short and they focus on getting you to do some of the stuff handson yeah so Udacity is a little bit more fun and again Udacity is also free so you don't have to like pay anything and after Udacity you have then they're not in any particular order you have EDX EDX so write that down in the comment so other people could see it but EDX is basically whoops let me just double check some stuff here so yeah EDX is basically another one that's really academic and rigorous I'm not a huge fan of EDX except so one that's really good the course is really good on EDX I believe is cs50 I think it's on EDX right yeah shouldn't you on EDX so there's a course called cs50 really good course except it's not in Python and you guys know me and I'm always talking about Python and the reason why I talk about it a lot so much is it's one of the easiest programming languages it's one of the most paid and it's one of the most popular right so that's why I mentioned Python a lot if you want to do Python cs50 is not going to be the course I would suggest to stick with Udacity and Coursera Coursera has introduced reactive programming in Python absolutely great course that's free of cost to you okay so with these courses you practice a lot right but what I want you guys to do is don't fall in the trap of gets really really high I should until you're slow python is slow Python Python makes you more productive that's what matters now it depends also what you're doing if you're making a game that is really really really dependent it says very bad connection for me can you guess confirm if it's indeed very bad connection I'm gonna try changing the connection here alright what I'm gonna try to do guys is I'm going to try to go from LTE mode to my to the WiFi here but in the office of WiFi is not so good so I'm going to give it a try for you guys okay okay now it should have connected to WiFi if the connection is better let me know and then we can continue from there okay so what I was saying was you have all these resources that make you really good but a lot of the problem that I see is that people get really stuck on doing exercises that are a lot of the times meaningless and don't actually go towards helping you build a relevant experience that your employers or people who are trying to hire you or looking for and the reason why I say that's a problem is because okay so me when I started coding as you guys might know I spent fifteen hours a day coding and learning which is why I was able to just learn it so so so so so fast except now that I look back one of the biggest problems I had with doing that you know even spending 15 hours and learning FS I could have learned it way faster one of the biggest problems I had is I got stuck in doing stuff that didn't put something on my portfolio it was a lot of theoretical stuff that I was doing there was a lot of academic stuff that I was learning from you know web sites like Coursera code Academy EDX Udacity all of those right team treehouse but there wasn't a lot of stuff that was teaching me you know even if they had me build a project that I could put on my portfolio they never really talked about where to go to start doing freelancing when to go to start doing freelancing or suffer you know because we'd have a fulltime position if that's your thing personally fulltime positions are not my thing not I'm not huge on nine to five o'clock and Dan and dayout I'm big on choices so I'm gonna have the choice and I want to choose to work not only when I want but also with who I want because if I'm working with people that I don't really respect or they don't really respect me then I want to have the option to not work with them is that true for you guys you know would you guys want to be in that situation where that's true for you is this going offline because I'm guests getting messages that this is going offline what's up with that okay beautiful so this is what you want to do right you want to make sure that you practice coding you build the skills but don't get so caught up in all the technical stuff it's really good but then it can lead you down a wormhole where when the deeper that you go the more like the less competitive in the job market that you become okay so hopefully that kind of answers the question of how to go from one point to the next point which is how to go from just learning to building projects and having something to show okay and then the next part for you would be to go from building that thing and then looking out for more clients now I wanted to segue into Jeff Bezos does anybody know what's going on with Jeff Bezos okay who knows what's going on with Jeff Bezos so he just bought Whole Foods right and what does that probably mean for the job market like what's gonna happen to all the employees that are usually working at Whole Foods I have a feeling that a lot of this stuff is gonna get automated call me crazy but I have a feeling you're welcome Zachary but I have a feeling that a lot of this stuff is gonna get automated and what happens when things get automated when things get automated you need a lot of people who can take care of the automation and the people who usually are doing the automation or your developers your programmers your data scientists your engineers and all of those people need to be able to do program so whether you're a reason for computer programming is you're looking to make a complete career switch from where you currently are but another important thing for you know choosing programming is that you'll have more opportunity and you'll also be able to get a promotion where you currently work and become more competitive at your current job there are a lot of people even on the YouTube channel one of the students said he got a promotion at his current job yeah it's um I'm so sorry about this guys this is crazy I'm probably gonna get just a whole another studio with badass WiFi or something like that because this is really frustrating that I'm trying to talk with you guys and you know it keeps cutting off because I sometimes lose my train of thought or you know I lose you some of you guys you guys drop out so I don't want that I don't want to give you a bad experience so yeah that's probably gonna happen very soon because this is crazy like my iMac stopped working then my computer stopped working and then my iPhone is the only thing that's working and then somebody apparently is stealing my youtubechannel wind Catherine qu ing CA th o e RI n e somebody who wants to write that in the chat please go ahead and do so and if you ever get a chance please go ahead and mark that as spam or mark that as copyright infringement because they're literally taking all of my videos all of my material okay so go ahead and do that now you guys also note that I am launching my course which is actually about to close tomorrow so there's one day left the course is called create apps with Python or Python olp create apps and essentially my whole point with this course and the reason why I made it is because of the same things that I had to deal with I went through doing crazy amount of coding crazy amount of like doing coding challenges problems going to academic route of learning have learned computer science and college at UIC I learned it from so many different professors have also taken courses on Linda and all these other platforms but the biggest problem I had was it was all academic it did help but it didn't help teach me how to get clients like for example I was charging almost twice the money that I was paying my personal mentor at the time because he was just not a good like he didn't know any soft skills for any business skills or anything that really made him somebody who could stand out from the crowd and he helped me in the room and one of the problems that happened was well first of all he just he would kind of stop right at the dot so if we had a onehour session with him he would literally stop right at that onehour session so this is something you guys can do with your clients as well okay with whether you get a client today tomorrow a few months or from years from now and whether it's in programming or anything else like you really have to take care of the people that are there with you and that are working for you the reason why I call people clients and not customers is is there's a difference between the definition right customer is somebody who buys something from you somebody who pays you for your services or your product whatever a client by definition is somebody who is under your protection so if you think like that you already start standing out from the crowd and when people work with you they don't want to work with anybody else because you really take care and watch out for them so that was one of the key things that I wanted to share with you guys and that was the key thing that made a difference for me in my freelancing life in my software consulting and I've seen that happen with lots of like good developers at all but the mentor that I had earlier that was one of his problems he would literally clock in right at the time that he was supposed to leave and he would do the least amount of work as possible and he would try to work with a lot a lot a lot of clients so for example he had I don't know like 40 people whereas some of the top people that I work with always had very few people that worked with but just took care of them a lot didn't get exhausted weren't frustrated by them and only chose to work with people that they found you know where there was mutual respect and those are some of the key things I will tell you whether you watch this video and leave right now you know shut it off close it down and then go on with your life this is something that will help you even if you are doing something in IT right now and you just continue doing that or if you're doing something in administration doesn't really matter this is kind of universally applicable yeah generator is yeah those are fun and Python you know you can you can do that and in my course that's you know some of the things that we cover and we build GUI applications which are graphical user interfaces because a lot of the times what problem that happens with students is that right now you may know how to code and you may not how to write like a random generator for words that can do yes or no but you guys a lot of the times don't know how you can take that code and I didn't know this as well and turn it into a real app something that people can click touch and move around right because the people who are using your applications they're not sitting in the command lines right trying to type some stuff what they are doing is they want to click buttons and move around and then do stuff right so for example when you go to a website or Instagram or Facebook wherever that's what you expect to do you're not sitting there in the codes what you're doing is you're literally clicking home you're clicking add a new friend blah blah blah right so that's exactly what you need to be able to do so you want to go from writing code because nobody really cares about just code but people do care about the results right that end results kind of what you have there at the end which is going to be an app or a project something like that Kazi i'ma Coalition has lost Python for my degree also to learn Java how does Python apply to Java different languages overlap Python doesn't really have like such a amazing overlap with Java Python can overlap with JavaScript you know HTML and CSS is not really a programming language but Python goes really well handinhand with HTML CSS Python goes hand in hand with sequel SQL Java mmm no like they don't really go handinhand but you know the concepts overlap because computer science daniel says i'm curious how much you make well even when I was like 20 21 I was making about $10,000 a month and a little over $100,000 a year that I was bringing in so yeah I've never relieved I've always just been crazy in terms of being able to figure out how to get work but more importantly how to bring value to the people that I work with you know I I really I'm crazy sometimes I'll lose business because of how insane I am and when I mean insane I just mean that if I think you're doing a wrong thing I'll tell you even if it hurts your and my relationship if I think you're gonna throw yourself down somewhere I'm not just gonna shut up and let you do it which is why a lot of the times are people that end up not working with me but then the people who do end up working with me we have a really good relationship you know obviously you have to be somewhat political and try to make sure that everybody is kind of okay and you're not just being extra aggressive for no reason but that's you know one of those things I'm 22 years old right now CG so yeah but yeah I just really care about the people that I work with and I really care about what I do and I'm not afraid to ask for the price that's right you know ask for what I deserve to be paid or ask for less than that because that's one of the problems that happens with a lot of people that I see is that you are better than you think you are like a lot of you guys right now probably getting underpaid I guarantee you like yeah somebody just asked me for a oneonone I pretty much don't do them anymore I'm almost gonna stop doing one on once because it's just it's um I was gonna say it's timeconsuming but that's not really what it is I'd rather spend time for everybody that's that clever programmer you know now we have over 30,000 students at clever programmer so I want to spend time for you know with everybody so with that said I'm gonna work less oneonone but I can almost guarantee that if i sat down with almost any of you guys right now oneonone I could help boost you by ten twenty thousand dollars a year like easy a lot of you guys I mean obviously there are some people who are like way better at this than I am so I'm not trying to like brag but a lot of the times what happens is people just leave money on the table and there are certain simple things that they don't know like in the United States we almost think it's a bad thing to negotiate when it's not negotiation is one of the most important things you should be doing here I'll give you a tip that will give you a return on investment of just watching this for 26 minutes never accept the first offer like when you guys apply for a job you'll get the first offer and then you'll just go oh my god it you know you're excited or whatever it is and you're thinking I'm not gonna get this again you go for it almost never do that just one of my friends recently got an offer for about $40,000 and I convinced him do not accept it he was excited out of his mind because he got to work as a developer and I said do not do that ask them for sixty thousand dollars twenty thousand dollars more we're sorry sixtyfive thousand dollars was twenty five thousand dollars more and he did he wrote this long email ask them for twenty five thousand dollars more and guess what happened they said no but with a big butt like Nicki Minaj no I'm kidding this said we're gonna put you at sixty thousand dollars so think about that twenty minutes or 30 minutes of my transtime just got him twenty thirty thousand dollars extra what does that mean that almost made him money that was one year kind of ahead right now that money was literally how should I say it saved him one year right that would have that would take him two years to make that money yeah Nicki Minaj oh my god have you guys heard her new song something about fraud I yeah I couldn't even pay attention to the freaking song I just love her so a lot of the times that's what it is that's why a lot of people just focus on the technical aspect but and it's good but you do you do do kind of need to be doing this stuff and it's not hard I promise you guys and I teach you guys this in the course I will literally all I will also be adding new content to this course constantly like nonstop it's called Python Opie create apps if you guys are watching this video and you're curious click on the link below and just check it out but I will be adding more content to this and I will be showing you guys exactly even what to say to you know keep a client or if you're working with a client how can you increase that price with that have an ongoing relationship how can you go about firing a clients I know a lot of you guys can't see yourself right now in that position of having a client because you're kind of just starting out so that might not be something that's realistic Kanako awesome man that's great that you joined this course I'm excited to have you I know you guys can't see herself there yet but that's okay you know I've helped enough people do this that I know that it's just like a repeatable process you know success it's just something that you see somebody have it and you follow what they do so it for everybody depends you know for example for Mira meets a team Iraq cause Gary Vee grant cardone and I try to follow what they do and that helped me in my business it helped me get clients all that stuff this is these are the kind of skills and things that I show you in this course in the start we're gonna be working in the course on becoming a better programmer so I'm be teaching you principles helping you master Python okay Cassie how and where will we get real projects to make back the money so in the course outline how can you start making back the money and I also talked about when you are ready to start freelancing there's one important thing that happens that is yeah you can even go on up work and find clients you know and it's not you know you can go on up work and find clients right upward calm there's freelancer calm that's no secret but the problem that happens is how do you end up landing the client how do you know you're ready to start freelancing with them and more importantly how do you actually stand out from the crowd right at clever programmer I actually have multiple software developers that actually work for me have two software developers we have a marketing development representative we have virtual assistant we have a business consultant and all of these people I have hired and I literally and I have a video editor as well so I interview people all the time I go through meza maze all the time and these are you know there are a lot of questions that I ask in there that I think are important and when I go through their CV or their resume there are many things that are important and I've got good at identifying to know whether somebody's bullshitting or if somebody's right and has the right practical skills to actually be able to do the job and those are some of the things that I want to show you guys in this course because a lot of the times it doesn't take you that long to become successful like you just go with for the people who are there and then learn that process and so it saves you you know years of your time something that's supposed to take you years you can actually end up doing it in months Daniel in the course there's no reason for me to other languages because I don't want to just teach you multiple languages which is a lot of the thing a lot of the times what a lot of academia does and then you can't get a job because all you know is just a bunch of different languages so I don't want to just make you go here make you go there and then just have your head spinning for no reason and that's the problem with a lot of the courses they have a lot of content a lot of crazy content to make it into like 20 hours so then they can be like hey look you know you paid for this course and this is what you got so I'm not a big on giving you guys 300 hours of material I want to give you guys little material but that gets your results faster okay I want to make this clear that this is not you know something that you just sit there and watch and it just automatically happens you have to make active you can have to work and put in the work and follow the stuff that I have outlined for you guys ask questions on the group and yeah then the results are there for you okay so that part is kind of tricky right when you go from mastering programming and then to freelancing when do you know you're ready to go there and those are the things I teach ok so again I have my oh my god we lost so many people I'm sorry guys so I have my phone on this one thing worse when somebody joins the course it kind of goes it makes a call to me and tells me the name of the person who joined so then what happens is it ends up going offline the live stream goes off so I'm just sorry about that like that just sucks but it's pretty cool you know now I get I get to tell you guys that who joined let's see Essen nice welcome Essen good job I have it under not disturbed but when I get to calls it ends up doing the call Austin nice let's see who else we got we got John joint that is great all right let me see if I can find some of the reasons why some of these students joined and tell you guys I'm you know what I'm saying okay so essen joined because he says he would like to build a portfolio quickly to show potential clients and employers working useful apps yeah so this course teach you how to build your own apps from complete scratch graph with graphical user interfaces things that people can click and touch and play around with and this course will show you those things I'm also adding new material to this course which will cover some web development fundamentals meaning that when you guys build this stuff you can show it to everybody around you we're gonna be specifically we're gonna be covering some of the flask framework and Python and I'll show you guys how you can build an app with Python that anybody can use I'm gonna be using the same tools that people use to build YouTube and Instagram and Yelp okay actually Yelp I don't think they use Python but read it does okay so I'm gonna be showing you guys some of those tools and I'm gonna be adding new content to this course so anytime I add any more content to the course you guys have access to it free of charge I don't charge you a cent when I add new content the last time I made this course available and I closed it down March 23rd since then the price has tripled yeah so the price has tripled since the last time I launched it and if after I closed it down now the price will likely increase again because there's just so much more content that I keep adding to this course you know it's made from the heart I spent a lot of time a lot of blood and sweat making these courses again I saved this quite often but I'm not trying to do this like some old instructor that's teaching you on udemy behind a PowerPoint who is just making that course so he can pay his bill okay so what tools are needed for the course and are there any additional cost that's a very good question Cassie and there are no there's no additional material that you need and everything is free of cost so I show you how to install Python and that's pretty much all that you need and if you need to get something like sublime text that's also free of cost and I show you in the course exactly how to download it in all of that so that is not a problem pretty much there's no dependency like you don't need to have taken any course before this it's a complete fit for beginners if you're a complete beginner or you've been doing Python for a few months this course is for you if you've been doing programming for years I'm gonna be honest this course is not for you you're too advanced sublime text is not paid if you want to pay then you can but you can also use it for free yeah you're welcome Cassie again I'm big on getting results on big on actually becoming an effective developer that gets worth that gets client I'm not big on just teaching you techniques you know I can do that and I always wanted to do that but you know I want to do something for you guys that gets you real results and as fast as possible then I'm sure you guys will be down to learn all the nerdy because then once you're making money the nerdy stuff will actually make even more profitable which is that happen which is what happened to me when I learned about intra relational databases and I got better at them right now they're about I would say probably are almost ten hours of content and then I'm going to be adding more content to the course so it's gonna end up being more than ten even just this next week you guys are going to be getting lots of videos on flasks and we're going to try to build something with flasks so yeah you guys are going to have more than ten hours of content there okay BSS try or no sequel I don't know Pet pet I don't know what that means what do you mean BS but yeah I don't know why you want to try manga or no sequel like databases databases the database like unless you're doing something very specific or niche it makes sense or you're doing something that's very highperformance maybe make sense but not really relational databases are okay a lot of things are built on relational databases Oh simple programmer just hit a hundred k subs that is crazy yeah I wanted to catch up to him and beat him but I guess he is there ahead of me he is there ahead of me the main the main point for this course is to help you guys make that transition there's no course that shows you how to make that transition from your current job your current work to the world of programming a lot of them just tell you to quit if you try to join the programming bootcamp what happens you have to pay like fourteen thousand dollars up front and then you have to quit your job and just do that programming bootcamp for I don't know like three months six months and then hope that you get a job whereas with this it works within your schedule so if you're already doing a job and you have a family or whatever right even if you're single that's completely fine you have to still pay your bills so I don't want you to just let go what you're currently doing I want to make it so you can do it within your current job spend hours on this and work on this get practical knowledge practical realworld product have the knowledge to build realworld projects and then I want to help you make that transition so my main focus in this course is to help you earn an income while you're actually learning and mastering Python okay and then once you've mastered it and you can start freelancing with clients so that's my main goal so to make it easy for you guys to make that switch as fast as possible all right sweet we just had Jennifer join Jennifer welcome on board let's see why some of the other students join Michelle I have been interested Michelle says I have been interested in learning Python also my husband has been learning Python but I had a hard time getting to a point where he feels like he actually knows something I have been encouraging him to do projects and thought this sounded like the perfect opportunity if he could learn to do projects and make money so he can quit his ninetofive then that would be perfect thank you for making the program so that is Michelle's reason Thank You Michelle for joining this is it's very exciting to have you on yeah Congrats ji Taber for joining and Congrats eat a diaper for joining guys I'm sorry on what I'm gonna have to do is I'm gonna have to turn off this thing that gives me a call the forty seven dollars extra is for the mastermind group the slack channel where there are other students they're available and you have access to me as well it's pretty much free and here's why I know forty seven dollars quite a bit but here's the thing when you work with a developer you pay one hundred a hundred fifty dollars an hour and that's a lot of money right and it's not recorded and you can't do it exactly whenever you want you can only schedule them a lot of the times once in a week so with this the idea is that you have access to us in your back pocket so think of it as your emergency hotline one you could use it just to learn and collaborate and network with everybody too if you get a client and you're kind of getting screwed you don't know what to do or you can't help them you can't figure it out you can reach out to us in the slack Channel and the community there will try to help you out do your project and I'll try to help you out too this doesn't mean will literally do your project for you like will code it for you but it does mean that will give you support and push you in the right direction so you're not completely lost okay so yeah it's a it's a huge kind of thing you know if you're getting $50 or $100 or even $40 an hour from a client that you're working with then having somebody who can help you out and save you and get you to work with them even for an extra hour or two you get you get a profit you make your money back so there you go rusty you're welcome okay I'm gonna go turn this off because we're starting to get tons of new students to join which is great the course does end tomorrow at midnight so today there's only one day left you guys if you guys want to jump on it it's a jump on it fast you know I'm kind of calm today I didn't really have my monster do you guys feel that him like really just relaxed today oh we had another person join the course okay so let me go and turn that thing off one second guys Holland's breaking my heart because it wants me to like cut the whole thing I don't want to do that okay whatever I'm cutting it out that's it okay so I had programmed this thing where when somebody joins the course yeah quaint Catherine is the channel you know guys take that take that channel down because it's annoying you know they they stole all my material they stole all my YouTube content um okay so yeah John you can contact Kazi at clever programmer comm to get your money back yeah so yeah I stand behind my courses like insane more than pretty much anybody out there and my course has a 60day moneyback guarantee if you're not happy for any reason I always say this you don't like my jokes you don't like my face or it's just not getting you the results that you expected you have 60 days to return it you know every other course gives you 30 and I want to make sure that I stand behind it you know I believe in this and I want to let you try it out so you try for 40 days you don't like it you return it no questions asked some simple as that the email is qaz I act clever programmer calm this guy goes I love your jokes and face and all the India guys look the same it was awfully racist no I'm just kidding I'm not from India from Pakistan actually I was born there and then I moved here when I was younger who somebody just asked that oh did you do the punch this course is not so much about game development though you can use the principles to then do game development like we do make some basic stuff John again for the money back you can contact me or you can contact Rachel pretty much anybody and I have my email there for you guys at all the times I would say learn the basics learn and master a specific programming language and then go from there but there are a few good books on game development I can't think of them yet for some reason but if you're looking to start off on like just learning the technical parts of Python or you just want to kind of supplement it you know use this that would be really good and some of you guys are saying hey we sent out an email guys it takes us a little bit to get back to you because there are a lot of new students that are joining the program now so we promise we'll get back to all of you I see all of your emails as well but there's a lot of people that I'm trying to reply to on Facebook on YouTube there are a lot of emails I'm trying to reply to and then going through this whole launch and course closing it's a little bit hectic so please bear with me I'm not trying to ignore anybody you will get a reply back and I will try to get back in touch with you as fast as possible okay so don't worry all your emails are coming to the right places we're getting your emails and we are going through all of them systematically but our main priority is anybody who is new and joins we want to make sure that they get the course they get situated and if they get the mastermind group then they're actually enrolled in the mastermind group and so that ends up taking more of the time but we'll get around to everybody okay yeah and thank you Rachel okay guys yeah so if you guys have any questions and stuff now would be a good point I want to take on your questions I want to share the course structure but I'm stuck on my phone because my laptop is not working and my iMac is not working so this is what I have my phone and then my internet dies so kind of a sad thing ooh nice so we got few more students who join this is amazing and yeah so while you guys ask questions I'll also read you guys off why some of these people are joining and maybe some of you some of these guys resonate with where you guys are now and I'll also tell you these people should be in the course so let's see okay kanya konyaku joined and Tania Co said to develop another career besides my degree and improve my job prospect so Kanako is actually in I think on the live chat as well hi can yakko and that's a great point basically being able to develop an alternative career so you can also have a backup so huge deal congratulations I'm very excited to have you on board and I hope you love this course it's just the best course like that's what it is it's pretty simple alrighty let's see let's see oh this is very specific goodness um okay I'm gonna try to go through this and give you guys the gist of what this person is saying because it's pretty long so I'm gonna do that and I'll show you guys my laptop so then you guys can see that I'm actually doing something and I'm busy look at that so yeah this laptop is apparently you need OBS to broadcast on YouTube and I didn't have it on his lap this laptop so didn't want to take the time to spend before going alright hidaya thank you for joining the course welcome onboard super excited to have you this is great you guys we have a lot of students in the slide channels we're going crazy because they're just joining it and there's a lot of buzz and excitement and this course you know it's take it on your own pace this course is lifetime access anytime anything new that it's yours there's no you know there's no really like you're gonna miss anything if you have work or whatever yeah and yeah somebody said learning is by trying and trying and trying I do agree with you because that's what I did to learn as well but I do also know that there are faster ways to learn just like I got to or reaching over a hundred thousand dollars a year and my income as a 21 year old right that's a lot faster than some of the people who reach it at a later age so there are always ways to like get to your goals faster and that's what I'm about so that's what this course is also about and I think you're gonna find it helpful I want to package things and get your results faster you can always look up other stuff and then put the pieces together but in my personal experience it just takes a little bit longer so that's really the point of this course alright reading this okay let's see just this weekend I came across your YouTube channel and have loved all your videos you really know how to hit the spot huh nice you're so right that all these online courses like code Academy udemy et Cie just teach you the technical and I always find myself unmotivated or stuck that's a good point I tried Python the first time this weekend and enjoyed it okay that's great to know so Nicholas just tried Python and he's trying to kind of quit his corporate job in Dubai and he's trying to join a nineweek boot camp in Copenhagen called label hone I don't know I'd actually say it so I probably butchered the hell out of it now this this is yet so this course now one of the things that he says he's unmotivated and stuck and I find that happened to a lot of people and I found that happen to a lot of my friends as well they got unmotivated and then they kind of quit and that happens all the time and I want to make sure that doesn't happen to you that's why I try to make all my courses with just a lot of love interactivity and fun you know when you look at my course you'll see what the hell I'm talking about when you look at this you're gonna be hardpressed to find something that is you know made with more love just the truth Udacity is a competition but I think that we can probably beat Udacity at this point and then another thing he says that he wants to quit his job and again that's really what I'm all about you know making that switch I was talking to you guys earlier about you know some people are trying to join the boot camp and then they are giving up everything that they're currently doing and it's such a huge investment this does it in a quicker way for example and it does it in a smoother way so you don't have to just completely go berserk and quit your job because I also try I also actually was part of a boot camp that's called thankful I have done everything so okay so to learn more about this and you want to check out this course click the link in the description it should be there it's called Python olp create apps so the link should be something like clever programmer dot two slash create apps with Python guys some people are having trouble finding the link so could you please do me a favor and copy and paste the link in the chat don't oh yeah I don't think it'll allow you to actually paste the link nevermind because I think YouTube thinks it's spam so just go in the description and then try to click on it and check it out and learn more about it for those of you who guys are wondering why should i I'm really interested in this course why should I join it today or tomorrow for two reasons one because then Ruhlman is closed tomorrow and then i don't know when i'm gonna launch it again probably a few months after at least two or three months and then the second reason is that when I launch it the next time it's going to be I can almost guarantee that it's going to be more expensive than it is this time because when I launched it last time in March 23rd you know since then the price has now tripled so because there is so much so much more content that is always added and that you know it's made there are so many new things that are added to it that's why it increases in price okay so I'm gonna read this all right so Nicholas says I I'm super excited to start your course as I would very much like to transition to a freelance work style to free up time for family friends and travel perfect being able to join pretty much at any you know any point shashi you keep asking me what's the structure of the course if you click the link to the course page that has all the details for you so if you click the link it's not like it's just gonna buy the course automatically it's gonna take you to the course page with all the details so you go in there and then it talks about it and if you still have questions I got you no worries no worries don't don't apologize it's okay if you still have questions I'll be here to answer you but the course you know covers things like when are you ready to start freelancing what are the three things that are stopping you from becoming a software developer how can you start making that transition even if you still have a job and then there's other technical stuff right like how to do objectoriented programming how do you make graphical user interfaces and Python how do you make applications that are visual how do you take code that garbage I mean I love code I don't wanna call it garbage that's disrespectful and so how do you take something that's just code and written text and turn it and turn it into an application that people use okay so I also show you that so yeah there are a lot of details on the page and that goes over it all right coding really is the most important skill to know nowadays I'm currently in sales and marketing Wow then realize most of our partners are not able to blah blah blah from that point on I knew coding was everything oh wow so basically what happened was he was doing okay so check this out I'm currently sales and marketing for a fivestar hotel here in Dubai and just when I joined we had launched a super duper stupid laptop I swear amazing offer and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars marketing sending distributing and then realized most of our partners are not able to load this offer as it was not compatible with their systems mall lol so I Ricardo so what is he saying he's saying that there was this deal that was supposed to happen it was supposed to be hundreds of thousands of dollars and then what happened their systems didn't work they were incapable of making this happen why did this happen because the people who are working to make this happen lack the right coding skills yeah they only have money no brains and no good developers so somebody who can do a deal of hundreds of thousands of dollars do you really think they would have trouble like one of their deals is that expensive do you think they would have trouble paying you 50 60 70 thousand eighty thousand dollars a year right they would not when that's just one of their deals so that's a huge huge thing to kind of hear about and again you know with Jeff Bezos taking over Whole Foods scan and goes taking over Walmart it's things are headed in the direction of the software development field Loren James asks about payment options payment options are not available with paypal but I think you can do PayPal credit it has one of those like built in you can do payment option otherwise so I have a three month payment plan for you guys and then also have onetime payment or you can pay with PayPal so I try to make it simpler for you guys oh wow good catch so apparently somebody said YouTube doesn't think it's a hyperlink oh wow this is really really good to know thank you let me go check this and see what's going on hmm interesting interesting huh apparently my computer says that I'm not even streaming I swear everything is just like broken I have no idea why it's making me so sad guys I'm trying to figure it out it's just giving me anxiety over here this life stuff is crazy okay I have no idea how to fix that cuz it's just not working crypto says since I can't afford your one on one is it worth getting computer science theater I always think it's worth getting somebody to do oneonones with you always it just helps make it it just helps make it happen so much faster whatever it is so for example I've been you know I was doing coding I've always had mentors now they have just gotten from beginners to like really professional level right so meaning they weren't beginners but they had just built ok stuff now at work with like top of the line programmers and some of these guys are charging 150 to $200 to $250 an hour so these get a little bit more expensive but if you're starting out you don't need those guys there are a lot of people who will still help you for $20 an hour $30 an hour when I was switching from what I was doing earlier I would make all the money on my job and then use that money to pay for mentors and then basically what I did is I traded the skill that I had in my previous job for getting a new skill of Python and programming this is hilarious Zachary I think he's one of the students who's joined the course earlier and he says Thank You Kazi and sport spired me to learn Python and now I'm addicted haha and then he says I'm just so broke I can't afford schooling I'm just learning on YouTube as if no and then he says I tried sitting in on some classes at the University but they caught and and caught on and told me to get out I mainly sit at the library on campus and try to find likeminded people so really good way to go if you don't want to get a mentor you don't want to spend that money font work to find oneonone people that was one of the things that has helped me as well i joined a meetup comm group and i would go there all the time and then i found one of the best mentors and his name is nick and he didn't charge me a cent and he helped me because he saw my passion I was doing 15 hours a day and I'm going nuts doing computer programming literally had bags under my eyes but then you know he would help me and he was my mentor he showed me the way he showed me how much to charge I would ask him you know where should I go to apply so I can get more work mmm how should I keep that relationship going with my clients you know so those things super helpful he says crypto says I want to be a computer engineer would you say it's worth learning a lot of Python no because programming I want to specced emphasize this that it's not about learning a specific programming language and being really good at it it's learning the concepts and being really good at them and then you can switch to another language for example I can pick up a new language like go or something I haven't tried much Ruby in probably two days and be okay at it and then obviously become better at it the more I practice it so once you have some expunge you understand how programming works and you understands the concepts then it's much much much easier to become better at picking up new things so focus on learning the concepts okay guys yes try make mistakes learn from them and grow those are some of the best ways for you to improve your skills okay those are tried and tested in my course Python olp create apps my whole point is to make that a shorter path for you to get you to make that transition to get you to that new career new job get more work you know have the ability to build projects do realworld things now this is the book again hi Sachi welcome to the corsage I just joined the course nice to have you in here let's see did I get an email from you yep saw she's not lying Sachi just joined love to have you in here who a Knick joint nice okay guys we're getting a lot of students to join which is great that is super exciting here's what I'm gonna do everybody who joins the next 15 students to join I'm gonna send you guys this Python programming book okay I'm gonna send you guys this and I'm gonna make this only available for you guys in the next 15 minutes okay so right now it's 610 p.m. in Chicago that's 410 p.m. Pacific time and so if you guys join by 425 ish or Pacific or 625 ish Chicago time I will send you guys this book Python programming by John Zell okay and then all you have to do is join within that time and send me a little message this is a great book I'll show you guys some of this stuff this is really good stuff so for example in this book you know he'll show you some stuff like how are you how can you make an application there's just no color on this this one is not gonna have my signature the signature offer I gave last time and that just takes a lot of that takes a lot of time and effort so signature offer is not gonna happen today but I will send you guys this book and you guys will have this book ok this is a really good book table of contents let's see very it gets rave technical but it's really helpful Sachi I'll still get you that book don't worry just send me send us an email okay and then what we do is we just match up the times and it's like magic okay so the chap chapter 1 computers and programs that's what this book goes over writing simple programs chapter 2 computing with numbers chapter 3 objects in graphics chapter 4 man so there's a ton of stuff where it gets more interesting honestly is to say decision structures and loop structures and boolean SCI kind of like that part as well and then let me see what else I like in this book I've gone through this book so I can tell you what I like um data collections yeah you don't really need to know that objectoriented design is good so if you're especially if you're taking it with my course it'll be really nice Ricardo if you join the course within these 15 minutes then you get this book for free simulation and design of this book also is a really good chapter I don't know if you guys can read that yep and then algorithm design and recursion is not super exciting yeah you guys probably can get this book it's a very popular book it's online on github as well I personally like to have a copy with me because I can travel make marks in it and then you know if I am driving it's still there with me if I'm at a hospital waiting for a doctor or some kind of appointment I can have the book with me if I don't have WiFi I can have the book with me and more most importantly the way that I could flip to the right pages and do it you know really cool so anybody who is joining within this time please send me an email we'll get you the book okay and here's what I'm gonna do for you this is my gift for you okay so if you are on this webinar and you guys have already taken the course please send me an email and then we will also send you the book okay but I will also make sure that you have been on this livestream so please do that leave a comment on this video or share it and that way it's easier to find out that you've already had this course okay so we'll try to send you a book but most importantly is for people who are gonna get this course right now so there are 10 minutes left okay yeah Cody there you go because you know you're here man you're watching this so I want to give you guys something for for being here I want I always try to give value to you guys whether you guys join my course or not or whatever it is that you you know whether you just stick to your current field I want to tell you guys stuff that you can actually directly apply so that's why I tell you guys resources like Oprah comm freelancer comm you guys can actually use them for even different types of fields and it makes your life easier I tell you guys the best free resources like Coursera Udacity EDX Co Academy team treehouse so you guys have that you guys don't join my course you guys still have all of the stuff that you need my whole my big thing holy crap there's a lot of students that are joining so yeah there's actually a lot of students that are joining so I'll read off read off some of you guys names so Russell just joined welcome Russell let's see Naza are just joined or another give org just joined welcome Greyson Taber just join welcome nice to have you rusty says that's me yep that's you nice Nam are just joined welcome on board and Lauren just joined cool that happened very quickly the course details are in the link and short the course is about mastering Python by building realworld stuff so you can you can get handson work right we're gonna be doing stuff that's pretty handson and fun and interactive to follow I'm not hiding behind a PowerPoint I'm right there with you guys building this together and then more importantly I am also teaching you guys stuff that you can start putting on your portfolio or giving you ideas of projects that you can start to build on your portfolio okay that's what I'm about I'm not into passive learning I'm not into me teaching you the entire time I'm into teaching new stuff that you need to do okay so I'm gonna give you the basics and then you get it done and then you have results to show for it I hate go because I've personally hated having to go through lots of courses where I at the end didn't have anything to show for it okay so I don't want to do that for to you guys where you guys are going through you know all my all my courses and then you guys won't have anything to show for it at the end I don't want to do that for you guys that's why even my course called learn Python by building projects which is a freak which is on YouTube it's called learn Python you guys are building projects in there the whole time like 150 videos that I have they're also focused on helping you learn while building stuff so yeah so I wanna have you show something for it and then I want to help you get clients so what do you do between mastering Python and getting freelancing work there's a step in the middle that's missing that's what I show you in the course to make that jump to become a freelancer and to know you're ready to be a freelancer how can you start earning an income before you can start freelancing okay this is a very realistic way of looking at it because most people are just like why don't you just quit your job put your family and your money at risk put your bills in risk and just take this six months long programming bootcamp for $14,000 I mean it's kind of insane so I understand that for most people and what I want to do for you is help you make that transition even if you're at your current job and even if you don't have all the time in the world to take the course right so getting you the results in a faster way be COO if you send me an email with your address we'll ship you the book don't worry about it so it's very simple send an email to kasi at clover programmer calm and you know just say that you are you just joined the LP course we'll crossreference if you have or not and then we'll send you the book okay very simple all right yeah just title just subject the thing like free book or books so then it's easier to kind of comb through that but I want to send you guys that okay yep I want to send you guys this kind of copy so I don't know if this is called soft coffee but this is what I want to send you okay all right so we're getting lots of students this is great let's see guys we got about how much how much time do we have seven more minutes right am i doing my math right five is twenty three plus two seven there are seven minutes left guys so whoever is joining within these seven minutes will get this book for free okay Python programming and it's a five star book this is a really good book so it will be yours yeah can Janka if you want to send your address for the book yeah send the address and then we'll send you the book yep you're welcome all right so few more students joining let's see new student must Marat welcome on board glad to have you here I'm gonna try reading some of your guys's reasons for joining the course okay my mayor just joined literally this person's name is mayor that's cool Jennifer says I joined this course because I want to get into programming and be able to create apps this course teaches you how to create apps with Python from scratch Glee apps that are gonna be on your computer and then later we're gonna do some web apps in this course as well where I'm gonna add for you guys so you can then share that more easily with your friends and family because a lot of the times you have this code but how do you actually make a graphical application link is in the description guys link is in the description if somebody's asking for the link could you guys please just send it in chat if you guys know it which is clever programmer to slash create apps with Python alright Jennifer says I wanted to learn Python and you have convinced me in joining clever programming welcome on board you are a clever programmer now I hope that you can help me become a programmer I hope so yeah guys look at the risk I'm willing to take right so if you guys join this course since there's a 60day moneyback guarantee you also get this book and if for any reason you're not happy with the course once you return the course you get a full refund and you get to keep the book so this is called the lose win right I lose but you guys win and that's what I want to provide for you guys because that's I'm confident I am behind this course because most courses teach you how well most courses take money from you I want to also help put money back into your pocket okay yeah guys I'm not look like one person's money is not gonna like make the difference he for me you know I'm not gonna be like oh my god my main goal is to help you become a programmer make an impact like my personal goal is to have a hundred thousand people become professional programmers so that's really one of my biggest goals and I want to do that as fast as possible by making the best courses as possible cut the noise out for you guys you know that's kind of what drives me every day and that's what I want to do so if you guys at any point are unhappy with the course you guys are you know again you don't like me for any reason you get the full refund okay I want to give you the benefit of the doubt so you get that and you get to keep this book so there are three minutes left if you get this course now you get the Python programming book which is you know one of the best books for a Python programming I'm a huge fan of it make sure to send me an email that says something about the book and that will be your book ok great we got Ronald on board welcome Ronald that is exciting Sachi joined the course one the book great you'll get the book no worries Ricardo Ricardo I got your email but could you please tell me could you please tell me Ricardo if you have got the course if you have already joined the course then yes we will give you the book Ronald just joined welcome Ronald super excited to have you Nora Mohammed you're on my snapchat I love her she's like my girlfriend across the entire universe there you go she has announced it live um let's see ok let's see who else is joining ok guys so we are getting some new students great let's see more why everybody is joining sure thing if you guys have any questions right now is the time to ask them and we will help you oh it's so nice one of the person in the chat was being a and it was so easy I just got to like click and then just block it's like a twostep process YouTube makes it very easy I love that so yeah just relax in the chat you know enjoy yourself and let everybody else enjoy and don't be mean or troll people because guys we're all here to learn ok and improve our skills and become marketable right so that's the whole point a pet pet no you won't be met um me yes I still managed to find time for sleep that's actually one of the biggest things that I've been focusing on not just going crazy but actually finding time to do other stuff like for example now I'm focusing on going to the gym or I'm focusing more on doing jiujitsu focusing more on sleeping on time and not doing 20hour days where I have bags under my eyes I'm just so scrawny you know that's not good and you guys shouldn't do that as well you know manage your time a little bit better I promise a lot of you guys have more hours in the day than you think the key the ultimate key to making your goals happen get a legal pad write down your goals and make them happen so for example I wrote down about 50 goals and I failed 49 of them and I succeeded in one and that one goal was actually clever programmer so you know it goes to tell you and now look this channel is a movement because if you guys right there are over at 50,000 subscribers going to hit hundred K and that is freaking amazing right so yeah write down your goals because a lot of the times will find yourself actually completing them so I had the goals of lifting becoming more fit eating better all of that and when I can see them in front of me it just meant turns me into a better person and here I'll tell you one thing they'll help you incredibly if you follow it I know it's like one of those old people things but trust me works really freaking well sleep around 10 p.m. and wake up around 430 a.m. or 500 a.m. like that alone will just change your life okay and when you sleep follow a REM cycle so REM cycles work in one and a half hours so one and a half hour or three hours four and a half hours and six hours so your quality of sleep matters more than your quantity so instead of sleeping for five hours four and a half hours will actually be better for you okay so try to do that sleep early wake up early and it will make a huge difference for you you'll find like how you got all this extra time that you didn't even have I'm personally a night owl and oh sorry I forgot to announce guys sorry before I keep going I forgot to announce that the time actually has passed but since I didn't announce it I'm gonna actually say if you joined in the next minute I'll still give you that

alright I'm gonna take on some of your guys's questions in the meantime so if anybody joins the program in this time join us Python I hope you create apps smoke is yours my friend okay so be cou says is there any way to sod the way to get the book is if you join the course within the next 50 seconds so do that is there an easy way to become better at syntax I have a video online that's called top 4 tips for computer programming beginners that will help you check it out all right guys we have another student we got Kevin in the game Kevin is in the house welcome Kevin super excited to have you my friend Kevin also joined the group okay great so some students are joining the group and their reason is that even if they can connect with just one likeminded other student they can then work together to build a portfolio or they can work together to look for jobs or at least do emergency hotline kind of thing where if you have a client and you can't help that we can't figure it out you can go to the mastermind group or are the private slack Channel you can ask for help so you can ask me for help or you can ask other students for help I'm not always in that group but if you post a question in that group or you're talking that I do come by and watch it a lot of the times and if nobody can answer you then I'm there to answer you okay all right guys awesome the time is up for the book I try to extend it for you guys but that's it anybody who joins after 629 p.m. or you know 629 p.m. Chicago time there's no book so no book okay guys awesome this is already really long it's almost been two or three hours tomorrow I'm gonna go live one more time guys my course Python olp create apps helping you create apps from scratch build projects and press the clients and teaching you how to get clients most importantly this course shows you how you can start earning an income while learning and mastering programming in Python okay there's two paths you can take one is a very academic theoretical and you can become good at that that's one path to learn programming the other path is you can take which is projectbased and you build stuff the first path is theoretical academic and leads to you earning exactly zero dollars the second path where you build projects have a portfolio that gets converted faster for you actually getting work that's exactly the reason why people graduate from college and for some reason they can't find work right and the problem is that they didn't have the applicable realworld skills to actually do a job they mostly had the skills of you know just do reticle stuff okay so that's all covered in this course I hope to see you in this course this course is only open until tomorrow once it closes its closed and then when it relaunches
