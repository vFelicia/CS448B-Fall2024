00:00 - - Hey you!
00:01 - Welcome back to Learn
Python Programming for
00:03 - complete beginners in
2019, the latest edition.
00:06 - We're gonna talk about while loops, okay,
00:08 - and basically while loops
are different kinds of loops
00:10 - but loops in programming are,
00:12 - if you keep doing stuff
over and over again
00:13 - without having to write
code over and over again.
00:16 - (heavy beat music)
00:24 - In the next video we're gonna talk about
00:25 - something called for loops, in this video
00:27 - we're gonna talk about something
called while loops, okay,
00:30 - so while loops, you
don't know when something
00:32 - is gonna to end, that's when
you use while loops for,
00:34 - for example, okay, I don't
know how many push-ups
00:37 - I can do, so I can write
a while loop and I can say
00:39 - something like, while Qazi not
tired, keep doing push-ups.
00:43 - Basically, I can like go like this,
00:46 - and just basically keep going right,
00:48 - this is like a while loop, like
if I'm doing push-ups right.
00:55 - This is part of a while loop.
00:56 - I don't know how many, I
stop, okay while loop is over.
00:58 - Over.
00:59 - So basically it's something
like, I would write in code,
01:02 - While Qazi not tired, keep going, and then
01:04 - when Qazi tired, stop.
01:06 - What might that look like, right?
01:09 - And I can go while
01:13 - qazi_turtle,
01:15 - let's say Qazi is equal to
01:19 - happy, okay?
01:21 - So while Qazi is happy, keep
making the turtle go forward,
01:24 - and then as soon as Qazi is sad,
01:26 - stop the turtle from going forward, okay?
01:29 - So while Qazi equal equal happy,
01:34 - right, then I can say turtle, Qazi, sorry,
01:39 - underscore turtle, dot forward
01:42 - by, let's say ten.
01:44 - Okay so keep going.
01:46 - Man I'm pretty much gonna
comment out everything else
01:48 - because I'm not gonna
be using it right now.
01:52 - So let's run this code and
let's see what it does.
01:55 - It just keeps going, unless I stop it,
01:57 - so I have to click stop,
01:59 - otherwise the while
loop will run infinitely
02:02 - and I'm gonna run into
something called infinite loop.
02:05 - So let me try that
again, if I run it again
02:09 - you can see it just
keeps going, keeps going.
02:11 - I have to stop it, otherwise
my computer is gonna crash,
02:14 - but if I change this to Qazi is sad,
02:18 - and I run it,
02:19 - it's not gonna to run it,
it has stop because it goes
02:22 - well check if Qazi equal equal sad,
02:25 - and this statement is
either going to evaluate
02:27 - to true or false, and because
it evaluated it false,
02:30 - because Qazi is not sad, Qazi
it says is happy right here.
02:34 - It goes "Oh, I'm sorry, I
don't know what the hell
02:37 - "you're talking about" and two equals sign
02:39 - means that you're checking
something with another thing.
02:43 - So for example, let me hit
02:48 - comment on this, comment on
this, and comment on this.
02:51 - If I do five equal equal
five, it's gonna say
02:56 - and I go to console and I run this,
02:59 - what is it gonna to say?
03:00 - Nothing, because I have to write print,
03:02 - so let me make sure I
write print and I run it
03:04 - and you can see over here,
it says true, alright ?
03:08 - So that is true.
03:11 - This is called the equality operator,
03:14 - it's checking between two things.
03:17 - This is the assignment
operator, so if I do this,
03:19 - this will give me an error
because it'll say you
03:21 - can't assign five to five,
03:24 - that's an error, but I
can do a is equal to five,
03:28 - but I can't say five is equal to five
03:30 - but I can check if five is equal to five,
03:34 - just like this is an operator
for checking stuff as well.
03:38 - Like is five greater than five?
03:40 - Is five equal to five?
03:42 - Is five less than five?
03:43 - So on and so forth, we're
gonna go more into this later,
03:47 - but this is an example of a while loop,
03:49 - it's something that can keep going
03:52 - unless the condition changes,
unless the condition changes.
03:56 - And there's a way to stop
the while loop as well,
03:58 - you can write a statement like
break and break out of it,
04:02 - but that's something I'm
gonna show you guys later.
04:04 - Now, I'm going to keep
the while loop part simple
04:06 - because the next part I'm
gonna to show you is gonna be
04:09 - why you should be using for
loops majority of the times,
04:12 - almost all of the times,
and while loops a lot less.
04:15 - You should really be using while loops
04:17 - if you don't know when
something is gonna end.
04:18 - So an example of that would be,
04:20 - you know I told this in one of my courses,
04:23 - basically I said, there was this one time
04:25 - where I was on an
airplane and I was sitting
04:27 - next to this girl, and I
was like what's the best way
04:30 - to pass time, so I created
this game called tic-tac-toe,
04:33 - and I thought okay,
how can we keep playing
04:36 - until it ends because
every time we would play
04:38 - the game of tic-tac-toe
or Rock Paper Scissors,
04:40 - it would come to an end and then I have to
04:42 - run the program all over again,
04:43 - so I wanted to do something
where it kept the game going
04:47 - until I specifically said, quit the game.
04:52 - So this way, every time we would finish
04:54 - a game Rock Paper Scissors,
04:55 - it would just start to
the next one, next one,
04:57 - until I hit Q,
04:58 - so for that because I don't know
04:59 - how long we're gonna keep playing,
05:01 - we can keep playing for ten
minutes, thirty minutes,
05:03 - we ended up playing a hundred games,
05:05 - so for that it was really useful
05:07 - to wrap an entire game in a while loop,
05:10 - so the game can just keep
playing over and over again.
05:13 - I had the whole thing in a
while loop so the game can
05:15 - actually keep playing over and over again.
05:17 - That was the really awesome part about it
05:19 - and that's how you use
while loops in real life,
05:22 - and in this video I just gave
you a little example of it
05:24 - and in the next video we're
going to cover for loops.
05:26 - With that said, thank
you so much for watching.
