00:00 - today i want to address an issue in the
00:03 - programming community and
00:04 - what we are at clever programmer trying
00:08 - to get rid of
00:09 - completely let me address this
00:12 - today is going to be a rant on elitism
00:15 - when it comes to programming
00:18 - there's this crew of weird freaking
00:21 - people
00:22 - that get their high from making
00:24 - everybody
00:25 - else feel low about themselves and they
00:28 - live
00:28 - on platforms like stack overflow they
00:31 - live on platforms like
00:32 - reddit do i mean every single programmer
00:35 - is like that
00:36 - of course not but a lot of programmers
00:39 - are like that
00:40 - even a lot of programmers on youtube and
00:43 - our mission at clever programmer is to
00:45 - get rid of every single one of them
00:46 - and have the most positive community in
00:49 - the world
00:50 - so i'm going to show you something i
00:51 - came across something pretty awesome
00:53 - on quora and this answer actually has 64
00:57 - 000 views
00:58 - and 370 upvotes so a lot of people and
01:01 - developers actually agree with this and
01:03 - it's basically about
01:05 - why stack overflow sucks
01:08 - j jesse james richard and here's what he
01:11 - says he goes
01:13 - stack overflow is such a piece of [ __ ]
01:16 - here is a perfect example i asked the
01:19 - question about
01:20 - facebook graph api that was immediately
01:23 - downvoted
01:25 - by the person let me actually just move
01:27 - this out of the way here real quick
01:30 - all right here we go by the person who
01:32 - sent me a link to the exact
01:33 - documentation i explicitly said i had
01:36 - reviewed endlessly before asking the
01:38 - question
01:39 - now i don't know about you guys but that
01:41 - exact thing has happened to me multiple
01:43 - times
01:44 - the problem wasn't in my code it
01:46 - inevitably
01:47 - was fixed because the documentation
01:50 - didn't note
01:50 - that there was a deprecated field but
01:53 - rather than saying i don't know
01:55 - the person answering had to make a fool
01:57 - out of himself because he didn't know
01:59 - but wanted to express a modicum of
02:02 - digital power
02:04 - that is such a beautiful phrase express
02:07 - a modicum of digital power
02:09 - this is so true a lot of these weird
02:13 - nerdy people living behind the scene
02:15 - they never actually come out and talk to
02:17 - anybody
02:18 - which is why they have trouble getting
02:19 - the jobs that other people are
02:22 - getting and making six figures and more
02:24 - and why they want to like
02:26 - yank your leg and pull you down and they
02:28 - used to do that [ __ ] to me
02:29 - but where are we at now baby this is the
02:32 - power
02:32 - of not listening to the [ __ ] haters
02:34 - and just doing what you were born to do
02:36 - on this planet
02:37 - so let's get back to this this is what
02:41 - people who are lower than you do to you
02:43 - to make you feel lower
02:45 - here are the things okay and now i just
02:47 - want to say i don't mean
02:48 - all stack overflow is bad right there
02:50 - are a lot of good people and of course
02:52 - same thing with reddit
02:53 - but a lot of this a lot of people what
02:56 - they make you feel about
02:58 - coding they make you feel patron that's
03:00 - patronizing their behavior
03:01 - they are condescending to you in ways
03:04 - that you don't even expect
03:05 - which is why so many people actually
03:07 - quit coding
03:09 - or people who have imposter syndrome who
03:11 - don't even want to call themselves
03:12 - developers even though they are pretty
03:14 - damn
03:15 - good let me keep going with this okay
03:18 - and it breaks my heart because i know
03:19 - a lot of people are beginners and this
03:21 - is the stuff that stops them or makes
03:22 - them feel stupid
03:24 - now he goes anytime i have a serious and
03:27 - i mean
03:27 - a serious question like i cannot figure
03:30 - out the answer after hours of pulling my
03:33 - hair out i then spend a few more hours
03:35 - wondering
03:36 - if i should even bother asking anything
03:39 - on that site
03:41 - because 50 50 i might get an answer
03:44 - or get immediately downvoted or
03:47 - closed generally with some shitty
03:50 - comments
03:51 - guys how many times has this happened to
03:53 - you
03:55 - it's happened to me where i'll post a
03:57 - question and they'll be like duplicated
03:59 - content and i'm like
04:00 - what for using the word the like what
04:03 - was duplicate about this
04:04 - and i used to post really good i learned
04:07 - stock overflow i got good at it i had
04:09 - tons of points
04:11 - but and i and it helped me too
04:14 - but i think for a lot of beginners it's
04:16 - a place
04:17 - that can be toxic for a lot of people
04:19 - and it stops you from becoming
04:21 - a developer a better developer once
04:23 - you're kind of out of that mental rut
04:25 - then you don't care then you just keep
04:27 - going let me keep going with this
04:29 - there are genuinely awesome people on
04:31 - there that will help
04:32 - work out a problem often taking time
04:36 - to work through complex issues with you
04:37 - that's awesome and generally when asking
04:40 - a question the problems are more complex
04:42 - than the mods would pretend
04:44 - so a lot of the times those mods just
04:45 - make it seem like oh this problem is
04:47 - like super simple
04:48 - just move past it and he goes
04:51 - if you're doing sysadmin db admin and
04:54 - applications among
04:54 - other things it goes without saying
04:56 - you're wearing a lot of hats and you're
04:58 - not an expert on everything
05:01 - so the experts need to put you in your
05:03 - place
05:04 - and destroy any meaningful opportunity
05:06 - to help
05:07 - anyone else out there solve the same
05:10 - problem
05:12 - and equally annoying is people solving
05:15 - their problem
05:16 - and not sharing the solution so
05:19 - on this note i mean you can't really
05:21 - control what people do but
05:23 - here we can try to control what the mods
05:25 - do and maybe
05:26 - just maybe the mods could be a little
05:29 - more
05:30 - lenient or a little bit more positive
05:33 - you guys look tyrannies right there
05:36 - tyrannies that have
05:37 - worked but then they're overthrown and
05:39 - then eventually they get taken over by
05:42 - democracies and a lot of the world has
05:44 - changed to a place of democracy
05:47 - and what comes with that there is a
05:49 - little bit of politics there is a little
05:51 - bit of not even politics just
05:54 - human to human connection right
05:57 - and you can let somebody else down
06:00 - but you don't have to make them feel
06:02 - like [ __ ] that is absolutely up to you
06:05 - and if you do that to people you my
06:08 - friend
06:08 - are a piece of [ __ ] so that is one thing
06:12 - that is not good to do to put other
06:15 - people down you'll always have a choice
06:17 - it's a choice to gently let somebody
06:21 - down to gently explain
06:22 - hey maybe this is not a good idea you
06:25 - should have done it this other way
06:27 - i think mods can develop a more
06:30 - encouraging language
06:31 - even if they have to let you down i
06:33 - think that's extremely important
06:34 - because remember you're dealing with
06:35 - human beings here right you're dealing
06:38 - with a person who's maybe a father who's
06:39 - trying to do this and then he can get a
06:41 - job so then he can put food on his table
06:43 - his family's table but that mod who
06:46 - doesn't care about anything
06:47 - might say something and it might make
06:50 - that person quit
06:53 - now what right let me keep going with
06:56 - this
06:56 - i hate that site i mean it's also funny
06:59 - this one because i hate that site if you
07:01 - didn't get that from this post
07:02 - and 50 of the people on it as do most
07:05 - people who use it for help rather than
07:07 - use it for a sounding board for their
07:09 - pathetic lives
07:10 - the fact that people generally hate
07:12 - going to that site goes to show how
07:14 - shitty it is
07:15 - the fact that people even consider
07:18 - if even asking a question on that site
07:21 - goes to show how shitty it is
07:23 - the fact that this is a known fact goes
07:25 - to show how shitty it is
07:27 - the fact that this is a question on
07:28 - quora goes to show how shitty that site
07:31 - is i look forward
07:34 - to the day someone built something
07:36 - that's not such a shitty piece of [ __ ]
07:38 - [ __ ] stack overflow man
07:43 - so wow this guy was really burnt
07:47 - i'm sure the comments are pretty good
07:49 - too i haven't read the comments
07:52 - stack exchange was started because
07:53 - people hated this site that's funny
07:56 - and the cycle continues you are
07:58 - absolutely correct
08:01 - um
08:05 - yep so
08:08 - a lot of there's a lot of hate there
08:11 - there's a lot of like people who are
08:13 - trying to make you feel
08:15 - low but there are also a lot of good
08:18 - people
08:18 - what my message is to a lot of you is
08:21 - don't
08:22 - become a part of anything that's toxic
08:24 - or negative for your mind
08:26 - there are plenty of other communities
08:28 - that are going to be helpful to you
08:30 - they're free discord channels free slack
08:32 - communities
08:33 - you can try to go get help there just
08:36 - i want you to get this picture out of
08:38 - your mind where all developers
08:40 - are extremely mean people
08:43 - a lot of them are not like that they're
08:45 - just some weird people who sit on
08:47 - forums all day and they don't have human
08:50 - interaction
08:51 - they turn into a little bit of nut cases
08:54 - and then they need people like me and
08:55 - other people to just
08:56 - [ __ ] wake them up because now we have
08:58 - a platform
09:00 - now we can do that sunny is a great
09:04 - example
09:04 - of somebody who's on the team who's a
09:06 - phenomenal developer but is
09:08 - also a good human being me i'm a great
09:11 - developer i am
09:12 - also a great human being at least i like
09:15 - to think so because i try to treat
09:16 - people
09:17 - fairly i try to treat people nicely and
09:20 - i don't do the type of stuff
09:22 - that people just often do on these types
09:24 - of platforms so
09:27 - if you are new put your head down do the
09:29 - work
09:30 - don't be discouraged by some of these
09:32 - people just know that there's a lot of
09:34 - positivity around
09:35 - if you're in the world of coding just
09:37 - know that you're not going to be alone
09:39 - that you have people that are supporting
09:41 - you you just have to look for them
09:43 - you can look for them in instagram you
09:44 - can look them in for them
09:46 - in facebook groups you could try to find
09:47 - them on meetups
09:49 - try to find them you have to actually
09:51 - work hard but get
09:53 - out of any type of toxic community when
09:55 - it comes to coding because there are
09:56 - just a ton of them
09:58 - join our clever programmer community
10:00 - come to our live sessions on youtube
10:03 - you will see what a healthy community
10:05 - looks like
10:06 - the cp family you guys who are on this
10:09 - channel
10:09 - it's just absolutely amazing the energy
10:12 - that you bring
10:13 - here every single day and i thank you
10:15 - for it
10:17 - guys there's a positive light out there
10:20 - avoid stuff that brings you down breathe
10:24 - in
10:24 - focus on the positivity get through it
10:27 - and again our mission at clever
10:28 - programmer is to help
10:29 - 5000 people get jobs in 2020 as
10:32 - developers
10:33 - so let's keep on going let's keep on
10:35 - crushing it
10:37 - and maybe in the comments you can let me
10:38 - know maybe what's a thing that bothers
10:41 - you
10:41 - about elitism when it comes to coding
10:44 - maybe what's an incident where you
10:46 - experienced somebody being an elitist
10:49 - with you when it came to coding did they
10:50 - make you feel dumber
10:52 - did they say something to make you feel
10:54 - patronized or were they condescending to
10:56 - you in any way
10:57 - i want a story drop it in the comments i
11:00 - want to read it and maybe i want to make
11:01 - another video

11:27 - this is qazi and i'll see you in the
11:30 - next
11:36 - video

Cleaned transcript:

today i want to address an issue in the programming community and what we are at clever programmer trying to get rid of completely let me address this today is going to be a rant on elitism when it comes to programming there's this crew of weird freaking people that get their high from making everybody else feel low about themselves and they live on platforms like stack overflow they live on platforms like reddit do i mean every single programmer is like that of course not but a lot of programmers are like that even a lot of programmers on youtube and our mission at clever programmer is to get rid of every single one of them and have the most positive community in the world so i'm going to show you something i came across something pretty awesome on quora and this answer actually has 64 000 views and 370 upvotes so a lot of people and developers actually agree with this and it's basically about why stack overflow sucks j jesse james richard and here's what he says he goes stack overflow is such a piece of [ __ ] here is a perfect example i asked the question about facebook graph api that was immediately downvoted by the person let me actually just move this out of the way here real quick all right here we go by the person who sent me a link to the exact documentation i explicitly said i had reviewed endlessly before asking the question now i don't know about you guys
