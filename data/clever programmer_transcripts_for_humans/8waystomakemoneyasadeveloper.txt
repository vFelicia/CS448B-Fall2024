00:00 - what's up you in this video we're gonna
00:02 - talk about eight ways to make money as a
00:04 - software developer there are going to be
00:08 - some obvious tips some not so obvious
00:10 - ninja tips and then a little bonus
00:14 - tip at the end for you guys that I think
00:17 - you're actually really gonna enjoy so
00:19 - make sure you stick around for that with
00:21 - that said let's jump right into it
00:23 - please help me beat the YouTube
00:25 - algorithm smash that like button if you
00:27 - haven't already subscribe to this
00:29 - channel because this channel is all
00:32 - about helping you become more successful
00:33 - as a developer and taking your income to
00:36 - the next level and with that said let's
00:38 - jump right into it I do want to mention
00:41 - that if you want to take your
00:42 - freelancing skills to the next level I
00:44 - have a masterclass it's in the link
00:46 - below I'm not gonna talk much more about
00:48 - it but it's pretty awesome go check it
00:49 - out let's continue I saw this video my
00:51 - first night and I was inspiring I was
00:53 - like we're gonna let me talk about this
00:55 - as well
00:55 - there are lots of different ways you can
00:57 - actually make an income as a developer
00:59 - and I feel like some of them are not as
01:02 - obvious to every single person and not
01:04 - every single person knows about them so
01:06 - in this video I'm going to share with
01:08 - you all of the ones that I figured out
01:11 - and did a lot of these personally and
01:13 - then which ones are the best you decide
01:16 - and then you go for that so let's get
01:18 - started and get into it so number one
01:21 - obviously getting a developer job okay
01:25 - so if you get a job as a software
01:28 - developer you can be making an income
01:30 - that's the most obvious let's go to
01:31 - number two you get freelance as a
01:34 - developer so what does that mean you can
01:36 - actually get say a local client to pay
01:42 - you okay so freelancing is broken down
01:44 - into many different ways because it
01:46 - depends how you actually get the client
01:50 - okay so for two will say local clients
01:54 - you can go to clients and you could go
01:58 - to meetup.com and meet people there this
02:01 - way it's easy for the people to get to
02:04 - know you like you and trust you because
02:07 - the see you face-to-face you actually
02:09 - have much more of a chance to be
02:11 - able to land a client that you meet
02:14 - locally number three you could do jobs
02:18 - on upwork.com now here's the trick with
02:22 - upwork.com if you type in and you are
02:25 - looking at jobs so say you go to the job
02:29 - section on up work and you type in
02:30 - JavaScript okay and you are looking at
02:34 - different jobs that exist there if you
02:36 - look at things that say expert developer
02:38 - and you need to be able to do something
02:40 - with data science or machine learning or
02:43 - you need to be able to do stuff with the
02:44 - pot cheat or something you're probably
02:46 - not gonna be able to do it
02:48 - okay it's gonna be a little bit too
02:50 - complex so you got to know your level if
02:52 - you're a beginner and you're
02:53 - intermediate you want to look for maybe
02:55 - not a job that'll pay you $15,000 you
02:58 - maybe want to look at a job they'll pay
03:00 - you $5,000 that's maybe building an
03:02 - online store it requires intermediate
03:04 - skill level and guess what it's gonna
03:06 - only take you a few months of experience
03:08 - to be able to build something like that
03:10 - so the eye you have to have the eye for
03:12 - what kind of project you can do if
03:14 - you're even more beginner than that well
03:16 - then don't do the thing that requires
03:18 - you three months of experience do the
03:20 - thing that pays you $300 that's most
03:24 - likely gonna be an entry-level thing
03:26 - maybe they wants you to write a little
03:28 - piece of code that can do something with
03:30 - CSV files or it tracks something on
03:32 - Amazon but those are all fairly simple
03:35 - things that you could actually be able
03:38 - to do with a few weeks of you know once
03:41 - you're past like the very basics of
03:43 - coding you should be able to actually do
03:45 - this even if you're a beginner on upward
03:47 - you gotta have an eye but upper calm is
03:51 - a great way to actually make money as a
03:54 - software developer number four tutoring
03:57 - now this is a thing that most people
04:00 - don't actually talk about and I think
04:02 - it's so fundamentally important and I
04:05 - don't know why people don't talk about
04:07 - this a lot but I think it's a huge and a
04:09 - very important way to make an income as
04:12 - a developer especially a lot of you that
04:15 - are actually learning especially a lot
04:17 - of college students and computer science
04:19 - students I think this is so important
04:21 - for you guys and not just for you guys
04:22 - but
04:23 - like personally for me and even my close
04:26 - friends we have been able to make over
04:28 - 70 $80,000 a year just from teaching
04:32 - coding to other people and before I even
04:36 - began and started doing freelancing
04:38 - how's teaching coding and the biggest
04:40 - reason is because in those days I myself
04:43 - was a beginner and so if I'm a beginner
04:45 - I am still able to teach somebody who
04:48 - has zero experience if you have two
04:51 - months of experience and you know if
04:53 - statements and you can write a while
04:54 - loop and a four loop and you can do very
04:56 - basic problems
04:57 - well somebody who has zero experience in
05:00 - coding and they don't even know how to
05:01 - write print hello world they're gonna
05:03 - relate with you really well they're
05:05 - gonna be happy to work with you because
05:07 - you're not that professor with five
05:10 - years experience or twenty years of
05:12 - experience who when like who they can't
05:15 - resonate with you know we all have that
05:17 - professor that we can't resonate with
05:19 - and we're like with the help we don't
05:21 - want to be around this guy and so you
05:23 - want to make sure that they want to make
05:27 - sure that they work with you because
05:28 - it's easier for them to relate with you
05:31 - you were in their shoes just a few
05:34 - months ago so you're actually gonna be
05:37 - better instructor for them and you can
05:40 - be charging thirty five to fifty dollars
05:42 - or more even seventy five dollars an
05:45 - hour
05:46 - teaching them if you completely suck in
05:48 - your complete beginner of course you
05:50 - can't be charging the fifty dollars an
05:52 - hour if you can't do anything and you
05:54 - have terrible social skills and terrible
05:56 - speaking skills of course it's not going
05:58 - to happen right but if you have decent
06:01 - social skills and decent communication
06:03 - skills and you have empathy and you care
06:06 - and you want to help somebody you can
06:09 - help the other person and you can be
06:12 - charging thirty five to fifty dollars an
06:14 - hour if not more so I'm gonna now break
06:17 - it down in two different places you can
06:20 - actually apply so number four I'm gonna
06:22 - say wise aunt so you can go on wise aunt
06:27 - and apply on wise ad to tutor people
06:30 - number five you can actually go to take
06:34 - since calm and apply by the way this
06:36 - video is not sponsored about wise aunt
06:38 - or take lessons those are the two
06:40 - platforms
06:40 - I used to use and my close friends used
06:43 - to use to be able to make an income
06:46 - number six I want to give this resource
06:49 - to you guys people per hour so there are
06:52 - a lot of people who are non United
06:54 - States when a constitute uhrin you might
06:55 - actually not be able to do it you know
06:59 - on wisent or take lessons because those
07:02 - I believe are primarily for United
07:04 - States so you might want to look into
07:06 - something called people per hour and you
07:09 - know Google also you can google the
07:12 - equivalent of a tutoring resource in
07:14 - your own country and people per hour is
07:17 - a good tutoring resource number seven
07:20 - code mentor now if you have any amount
07:25 - of experience in coding especially if
07:27 - you're more advanced this is not a
07:29 - beginner friendly platform so if you're
07:31 - a beginner do not look at code mentor
07:33 - dot IO but if you have like if you're
07:36 - good or you're advanced I mean this is
07:40 - your platform this is a highly it's so
07:43 - curated and it's so amazing for
07:46 - freelance developers who want to be able
07:48 - to help people and what I found on code
07:52 - mentors is the clients or also really
07:55 - incredibly skilled people and really
07:58 - amazing people in general so you're not
07:59 - working with like little kids or people
08:02 - who have no idea about coding like you
08:04 - might be working with unwise ants or
08:06 - take lessons for people per hour but on
08:09 - code mentor you're working with also
08:11 - really amazing people and so this is a
08:13 - great platform if you're skilled as a
08:15 - developer and you can actually be making
08:18 - probably one of the probably the most
08:20 - amount of money and when it comes to
08:22 - teaching on code mentor there are a lot
08:25 - of developers I know that are actually
08:27 - making six figures on code mentor and
08:31 - absolutely killing it and have a great
08:32 - lifestyle so I would look into code
08:36 - mentor number eight
08:38 - YouTube now this is a bonus one but I
08:43 - want to mention this because there's
08:44 - every developer Under the Sun is doing
08:47 - something with coding and on YouTube
08:51 - first of all of course there's me I'm a
08:53 - developer and I'm on YouTube and then
08:56 - you have Joshua fluke and then you have
08:58 - Corey Schaffer and then you have Chris
09:00 - Hawk and then you have Johnson miss and
09:02 - then you have tech lead and you got Joe
09:04 - matech I mean oh my lord the list goes
09:06 - on the point is they all figured out the
09:09 - trick which has become a developer and
09:11 - make videos so did I it works there's a
09:15 - huge niche for developers online and
09:19 - everybody and their frickin mother when
09:22 - they make a video on a day in the life
09:23 - as a software engineer
09:25 - it gets views I made one it got views
09:29 - and everybody else in the world makes
09:32 - one I just recently saw a day in the
09:34 - life of software engineer and it's like
09:35 - parenthesis New York you know one month
09:38 - ago and it has like hundreds of
09:40 - thousands of views you know I know this
09:42 - kid Chris jury's ax made go Chris Harris
09:45 - I don't know how to say his name he made
09:47 - that and then he got on the map and like
09:49 - I know forest Knight has made something
09:51 - on this like literally everybody
09:53 - including me has made something on on
09:56 - these types of titles and it just gets a
09:59 - ton of views and you could be making a
10:03 - decent amount of income from just
10:06 - YouTube ad revenue especially if you're
10:07 - getting lots of views I mean somebody
10:09 - like tech lead I mean this guy is
10:11 - probably getting what like 100 like 50
10:14 - thousand is a safe to say fifty thousand
10:16 - a month right 25 thousand Tony let's say
10:19 - plus it 25 thousand you know 250
10:22 - thousand dollars a month just from ads
10:24 - on YouTube but then he's also selling
10:26 - his own courses right I am selling my
10:29 - own products for anybody who's
10:31 - interested in my products they go to my
10:32 - website and they go buy my product for
10:35 - anybody that's interested in tech leads
10:36 - product they go to his website hit by
10:38 - his damn product the same thing with
10:40 - like Joma attack or whoever else right
10:42 - like it's a similar pattern Joshua fluke
10:45 - he has his own products and he sells
10:47 - them and you know coding dojo has his
10:49 - prod like everybody has
10:51 - get out and at this point it's not even
10:54 - like a guess it's not even a is it
10:57 - actually gonna work out for you I don't
10:59 - know who has failed but like take my
11:01 - friend Tenzin he has a channel on what's
11:03 - dev and he's doing really well with it
11:06 - everybody has a chance at least for now
11:09 - I don't know like once maybe it gets too
11:11 - saturated but like as of now it seems
11:13 - like it's fair game for every single
11:15 - person so there you have it 8 ways to
11:18 - make money as a software developer

Cleaned transcript:

what's up you in this video we're gonna talk about eight ways to make money as a software developer there are going to be some obvious tips some not so obvious ninja tips and then a little bonus tip at the end for you guys that I think you're actually really gonna enjoy so make sure you stick around for that with that said let's jump right into it please help me beat the YouTube algorithm smash that like button if you haven't already subscribe to this channel because this channel is all about helping you become more successful as a developer and taking your income to the next level and with that said let's jump right into it I do want to mention that if you want to take your freelancing skills to the next level I have a masterclass it's in the link below I'm not gonna talk much more about it but it's pretty awesome go check it out let's continue I saw this video my first night and I was inspiring I was like we're gonna let me talk about this as well there are lots of different ways you can actually make an income as a developer and I feel like some of them are not as obvious to every single person and not every single person knows about them so in this video I'm going to share with you all of the ones that I figured out and did a lot of these personally and then which ones are the best you decide and then you go for that so let's get started and get into it so number one obviously getting a developer job okay so if you get a job as a software developer you can be making an income that's the most obvious let's go to number two you get freelance as a developer so what does that mean you can actually get say a local client to pay you okay so freelancing is broken down into many different ways because it depends how you actually get the client okay so for two will say local clients you can go to clients and you could go to meetup.com and meet people there this way it's easy for the people to get to know you like you and trust you because the see you facetoface you actually have much more of a chance to be able to land a client that you meet locally number three you could do jobs on upwork.com now here's the trick with upwork.com if you type in and you are looking at jobs so say you go to the job section on up work and you type in JavaScript okay and you are looking at different jobs that exist there if you look at things that say expert developer and you need to be able to do something with data science or machine learning or you need to be able to do stuff with the pot cheat or something you're probably not gonna be able to do it okay it's gonna be a little bit too complex so you got to know your level if you're a beginner and you're intermediate you want to look for maybe not a job that'll pay you $15,000 you maybe want to look at a job they'll pay you $5,000 that's maybe building an online store it requires intermediate skill level and guess what it's gonna only take you a few months of experience to be able to build something like that so the eye you have to have the eye for what kind of project you can do if you're even more beginner than that well then don't do the thing that requires you three months of experience do the thing that pays you $300 that's most likely gonna be an entrylevel thing maybe they wants you to write a little piece of code that can do something with CSV files or it tracks something on Amazon but those are all fairly simple things that you could actually be able to do with a few weeks of you know once you're past like the very basics of coding you should be able to actually do this even if you're a beginner on upward you gotta have an eye but upper calm is a great way to actually make money as a software developer number four tutoring now this is a thing that most people don't actually talk about and I think it's so fundamentally important and I don't know why people don't talk about this a lot but I think it's a huge and a very important way to make an income as a developer especially a lot of you that are actually learning especially a lot of college students and computer science students I think this is so important for you guys and not just for you guys but like personally for me and even my close friends we have been able to make over 70 $80,000 a year just from teaching coding to other people and before I even began and started doing freelancing how's teaching coding and the biggest reason is because in those days I myself was a beginner and so if I'm a beginner I am still able to teach somebody who has zero experience if you have two months of experience and you know if statements and you can write a while loop and a four loop and you can do very basic problems well somebody who has zero experience in coding and they don't even know how to write print hello world they're gonna relate with you really well they're gonna be happy to work with you because you're not that professor with five years experience or twenty years of experience who when like who they can't resonate with you know we all have that professor that we can't resonate with and we're like with the help we don't want to be around this guy and so you want to make sure that they want to make sure that they work with you because it's easier for them to relate with you you were in their shoes just a few months ago so you're actually gonna be better instructor for them and you can be charging thirty five to fifty dollars or more even seventy five dollars an hour teaching them if you completely suck in your complete beginner of course you can't be charging the fifty dollars an hour if you can't do anything and you have terrible social skills and terrible speaking skills of course it's not going to happen right but if you have decent social skills and decent communication skills and you have empathy and you care and you want to help somebody you can help the other person and you can be charging thirty five to fifty dollars an hour if not more so I'm gonna now break it down in two different places you can actually apply so number four I'm gonna say wise aunt so you can go on wise aunt and apply on wise ad to tutor people number five you can actually go to take since calm and apply by the way this video is not sponsored about wise aunt or take lessons those are the two platforms I used to use and my close friends used to use to be able to make an income number six I want to give this resource to you guys people per hour so there are a lot of people who are non United States when a constitute uhrin you might actually not be able to do it you know on wisent or take lessons because those I believe are primarily for United States so you might want to look into something called people per hour and you know Google also you can google the equivalent of a tutoring resource in your own country and people per hour is a good tutoring resource number seven code mentor now if you have any amount of experience in coding especially if you're more advanced this is not a beginner friendly platform so if you're a beginner do not look at code mentor dot IO but if you have like if you're good or you're advanced I mean this is your platform this is a highly it's so curated and it's so amazing for freelance developers who want to be able to help people and what I found on code mentors is the clients or also really incredibly skilled people and really amazing people in general so you're not working with like little kids or people who have no idea about coding like you might be working with unwise ants or take lessons for people per hour but on code mentor you're working with also really amazing people and so this is a great platform if you're skilled as a developer and you can actually be making probably one of the probably the most amount of money and when it comes to teaching on code mentor there are a lot of developers I know that are actually making six figures on code mentor and absolutely killing it and have a great lifestyle so I would look into code mentor number eight YouTube now this is a bonus one but I want to mention this because there's every developer Under the Sun is doing something with coding and on YouTube first of all of course there's me I'm a developer and I'm on YouTube and then you have Joshua fluke and then you have Corey Schaffer and then you have Chris Hawk and then you
