00:06 - this video you know we're gonna be
00:08 - talking about we're gonna be talking
00:10 - about a day in the life of a software
00:13 - developer now is it just me or is this a
00:17 - very popular trend now everybody in the
00:19 - goddamn mothers doing this video so why
00:22 - you Kazi is a new talking to me i'm Kazi
00:26 - hello hi nice to meet you and if you
00:29 - like to meet me to the smash that like
00:31 - button you know what I'm saying and
00:32 - subscribe to the channel morty you're
00:34 - gonna become a great developer you
00:36 - subscribe alright let's continue
00:38 - everybody I've been looking around
00:40 - everywhere right it seems like a very
00:41 - popular thing to do every youtuber who's
00:44 - a developer starts off with this and
00:46 - then they blow up and then that's all
00:48 - they do so guess what you know what I
00:51 - think it's time that I made a video on
00:52 - this topic to again this is one of my
00:55 - favorite parts where I get to take
00:57 - something I drew up on the whiteboard
00:59 - actually started in my brain then I
01:01 - bring it over here I cut it up and it
01:03 - starts turning it into reality and
01:06 - before we continue I do want to let you
01:08 - know that if you want to become a
01:10 - software developer or a freelance
01:12 - developer be able to travel and earn an
01:14 - income and you also want to put in the
01:16 - hard work that this actually requires
01:19 - but guess what I have a three part free
01:22 - master class for you that is absolutely
01:24 - amazing it is if you are interested in
01:26 - becoming a Python developer the link is
01:29 - in the description below it's a ton of
01:30 - value for your beautiful face all you
01:32 - got to do is pop in your email and then
01:34 - I unlocked the entire master class for
01:36 - you let's continue so let's talk about
01:39 - what you guys are here for what does a
01:40 - day in the life of a software developer
01:42 - look like and now for me my routine it's
01:45 - very simple you know what it is I don't
01:48 - really have a routine and everybody
01:51 - who's trying to tell you in all their
01:53 - software developer videos I mean
01:54 - including mine to be honest like I made
01:56 - one and I said I showed that I have this
01:59 - perfect routine which at that time for
02:00 - that few months I kind of did but to be
02:04 - honest I wish life was like that
02:06 - because life is very messy
02:09 - like sometimes you are out there and
02:12 - boxing with your girlfriend and
02:18 - sometimes you're supporting your
02:20 - girlfriend after she has ran from Santa
02:22 - Monica to Las Vegas on barefoot oh cool
02:42 - [Music]
02:54 - crazy stuff but what's my point my point
02:58 - is that look life is not that straight
03:02 - forward it's pretty complicated and it's
03:04 - messy and overall I guess what I'm
03:08 - trying to say is that for software
03:10 - developers people always try to put us
03:12 - in a box
03:13 - nerds behind computers and that's all
03:16 - they do and yes while we are nerds and
03:19 - we love data and analytics and stuff
03:21 - with code we are human beings and we're
03:24 - also people who love to enjoy life and
03:28 - do activities and enjoy sports and all
03:30 - that kind of stuff right like when you
03:32 - look online people paint this picture
03:34 - which at least in my opinion most of the
03:36 - times it's like really boring and dull
03:38 - and I could never do that my life sounds
03:40 - kind of crazy there's all kinds of stuff
03:42 - I'm doing coding allows me to travel and
03:44 - be able to do all those things
03:46 - [Music]
03:55 - sup Naz there we go
04:00 - now dance
04:12 - all right come on bro let's go
04:22 - trick your [ __ ] let's do a challenge
04:26 - poop himself after it for human elevator

05:11 - [Music]
05:15 - how does it feel to lose Naz you know
05:21 - why his elevator was ready up so as long
05:25 - as Josie pressed it
05:27 - oh ha ha your velvet elevator was
05:31 - downstairs uh-huh sometimes I want to
05:36 - see my mom in Chicago sometimes my dad
05:39 - in Chicago or my family members all over
05:42 - you know California or whatever it may
05:44 - be
05:44 - and I can go ahead and do that while
05:46 - doing something I love which is coding
05:48 - and creating stuff taking out on my head
05:50 - and turning it into reality so when you
05:53 - aren't thinking about coding please also
05:55 - think about do you actually enjoy it and
05:58 - would you actually overcome all of those
06:01 - challenges because to become a developer
06:04 - that's something you really have to love
06:11 - I'm in Detroit Michigan with my boy nas
06:15 - yeah
06:16 - to do the course yeah we're shooting a
06:18 - prop of a JavaScript course and
06:20 - literally like living with me right now
06:22 - that's it yeah I'm actually living in it
06:23 - yeah but that's the cool thing about
06:25 - programming and software development I
06:27 - feel like it gives you that lifestyle to
06:30 - be able to do cool [ __ ] and I know
06:32 - that's why I like it why do you like it
06:34 - you do remote work and your discipline
06:37 - person all you can pretty much see
06:39 - go from nine to five you're not doing
06:41 - this there's no there's no one telling
06:45 - you what to do you get up when you want
06:47 - I can literally go like I go out like go
06:50 - to Bali right now is still work there's
06:51 - 20 fine what is the reason that you code
06:55 - what's your reason I want you to go
06:56 - ahead and comment that below and let me
06:58 - know what is your reason for doing it
07:00 - get up what you want obviously figure
07:05 - out what you want you get decide what
07:07 - party's gonna do depending on what
07:08 - you're doing and also now we're here
07:11 - this is the Hudson cafe
07:15 - [Music]
07:27 - now here's the thing quoting for me
07:30 - actually opened up a ton of opportunity
07:33 - in all kinds of areas that allow me to
07:35 - actually speak in front of people that
07:37 - allow me to meet cool people it allowed
07:40 - me to travel the world go to Colombia
07:42 - and all those types of things because in
07:44 - the start I was a freelance when I was
07:45 - making six figures per year I figured
07:48 - out how to do that with a lot of hard
07:50 - work but then I also figured out how to
07:53 - take that and turn it into a business
07:55 - and now into a YouTube channel which is
07:57 - a similar pattern you see a lot of other
07:59 - developers doing like take a look at
08:00 - tech lead or Joma tech I mean they
08:03 - became developers and then they left it
08:05 - because YouTube there's a lot more
08:07 - monetary gain to be made there than just
08:10 - coding I still code and I still do that
08:12 - type of stuff but I'm just doing a lot
08:14 - less freelancing work I just love it man
08:17 - I love being able to create something
08:20 - whether it's in Python or JavaScript or
08:22 - whatever it is like I love being able to
08:24 - create a graphical user interface I love
08:27 - being able to get my ideas out and turn
08:30 - them into a real thing and the start for
08:32 - me it started off with using an excel
08:34 - sheet to do stuff and as a coach I would
08:36 - travel to people's homes and then they
08:38 - would pay me per hour to coach them in
08:40 - chess and also people would pay me to
08:42 - teach them coding and so I was like hey
08:45 - why don't I just make something that
08:47 - once I get to that person's house it
08:49 - automatically logs it so my excel sheet
08:52 - would detect that type of stuff but then
08:53 - the excel sheet got really lame in doing
08:56 - that and it reached its max capacity so
08:59 - I could learn something more I had to
09:01 - learn something bigger and lo and behold
09:03 - I ran into this beautiful thing you
09:06 - little cool kids called programming and
09:09 - that's where I started getting really
09:10 - fascinated about it I'm like man the
09:12 - applications and the use cases of coding
09:15 - are just so vast and so amazing I need
09:20 - to learn this thing and then once I got
09:22 - into it I realized there is there's
09:25 - pretty much an infinite amount of things
09:27 - that I could actually do with coding and
09:30 - there was no limit to what I could do if
09:32 - I could think it I could create it
09:34 - whether it's a mobile
09:35 - app or whether it's an app online on
09:38 - website if you think about entering
09:40 - Facebook I think we're entering Mark
09:41 - Zuckerberg drain I literally think we
09:44 - are entering a part of the cerebral
09:46 - cortex and we're entering his universe
09:49 - that he created I feel like that's a
09:51 - very important thing you kind of got to
09:53 - get in your heart about coding and if
09:56 - you can get that I think then you can do
09:58 - a lot of other things that is the hard
10:00 - work because becoming better in becoming
10:03 - a software developer and being able to
10:04 - get paid for it right like I was making
10:06 - six figures as a freelance developer I
10:08 - tell this to people and they're like
10:10 - well you know that's not easy it's not
10:12 - it's not easy that's not the point it's
10:14 - very difficult if you love it you will
10:18 - persist through every difficulty that
10:20 - actually comes in your way cuz
10:21 - programming don't get me wrong is
10:23 - ridiculously difficult and at times it's
10:26 - downright frustrating disappointing and
10:29 - has you freaking pulling out the hair
10:31 - out of the roots of your brain because
10:35 - certain things just don't make sense
10:37 - you'll spend eight hours and the code
10:39 - isn't working and then you will come
10:41 - back and the next day it's working and
10:43 - you go look what the hell happened
10:44 - somebody will be like oh yeah your API
10:46 - was getting throttled and you're like
10:48 - what's throttling and then you're like
10:50 - what's API it's a tough journey it's
10:53 - very confusing journey it's very
10:55 - overwhelming with all of the stuff you
10:57 - gotta learn you gotta learn four
10:58 - different frameworks and you got to
11:00 - learn new technology every single day
11:02 - you got to learn how to be able to read
11:03 - code you got to learn how to actually
11:05 - get negotiation skills and soft skills
11:07 - to be able to land clients and so if you
11:11 - are jumping into it because you see it
11:15 - as an opportunity where you can jump in
11:17 - and create an additional revenue source
11:19 - for yourself don't do coding do the
11:23 - stock market get paid in dividends start
11:26 - a side hustle start a business start a
11:27 - ecommerce business sell women's perfume
11:30 - sell products but don't jump into coding
11:33 - if that's the only reason you want to do
11:34 - it if you want to jump into coding
11:36 - because you love it and you truly enjoy
11:38 - it and you know at this point if you are
11:40 - a coder that's great you already know
11:43 - why it's so enjoyable but if you
11:44 - not a developer and you're watching this
11:46 - video and you're like man I'm thinking
11:48 - about it you have to experience it for
11:50 - yourself you got to go at your own pace
11:51 - you know go slow you don't have to get
11:54 - there fast because a lot of my joy for
11:56 - coding was killed in colleges and things
11:58 - like that and so what you really want to
12:02 - be able to do is you want to be able to
12:05 - just coat it your own pace and not do
12:07 - such crazy things that like in college
12:09 - the first week will be like a print your
12:11 - name and second week is like make the
12:14 - Domino's app so the difficulty just
12:17 - increases really really fast okay so go
12:20 - slow go at your own pace really enjoy
12:23 - the art of development I put in a lot of
12:26 - work you know when I say this to people
12:28 - people don't it's hard for them to
12:31 - actually understand this or believe this
12:32 - but I was putting in 18 to 19 hours of
12:35 - work every single day and I pretty much
12:39 - you know gave up on the idea of having
12:42 - this thing called life and so it's
12:45 - really important for you to understand
12:47 - like what I was able to achieve in that
12:49 - time wasn't because I was smart I just
12:51 - put in as much work as somebody would in
12:54 - four years of time you know I was able
12:55 - to put that work in about six three
12:57 - months or six months and then I was able
13:00 - to just get a head start you know I
13:01 - didn't focus on anything else that's all
13:03 - I did I just lived breathed and eight
13:06 - code for 20 hours a day you know and my
13:10 - friend Tenzin would be with me and we
13:12 - would go to these co-working spaces and
13:14 - learn it and it was awesome it was
13:15 - fantastic
13:16 - okay and so I hope like my goal with
13:20 - this video is to just give you some of
13:23 - my personal experience with coding and
13:25 - get you to critically think of why you
13:28 - want to become a developer you know why
13:30 - do you want to do this and what kind of
13:33 - lifestyle do you want to have that's my
13:34 - day in the life of a software developer
13:36 - I really hope you enjoyed this video
13:38 - this is kaki I love your face and oh by
13:40 - the way if you haven't already smashed
13:42 - that like button
13:43 - break
13:43 - [ __ ] subscribe to the channel I love
13:46 - your face

13:48 - you June in the next video
13:51 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey you what's up how's it going welcome this video you know we're gonna be talking about we're gonna be talking about a day in the life of a software developer now is it just me or is this a very popular trend now everybody in the goddamn mothers doing this video so why you Kazi is a new talking to me i'm Kazi hello hi nice to meet you and if you like to meet me to the smash that like button you know what I'm saying and subscribe to the channel morty you're gonna become a great developer you subscribe alright let's continue everybody I've been looking around everywhere right it seems like a very popular thing to do every youtuber who's a developer starts off with this and then they blow up and then that's all they do so guess what you know what I think it's time that I made a video on this topic to again this is one of my favorite parts where I get to take something I drew up on the whiteboard actually started in my brain then I bring it over here I cut it up and it starts turning it into reality and before we continue I do want to let you know that if you want to become a software developer or a freelance developer be able to travel and earn an income and you also want to put in the hard work that this actually requires but guess what I have a three part free master class for you that is absolutely amazing it is if you are interested in becoming a Python developer the link is in the description below it's a ton of value for your beautiful face all you got to do is pop in your email and then I unlocked the entire master class for you let's continue so let's talk about what you guys are here for what does a day in the life of a software developer look like and now for me my routine it's very simple you know what it is I don't really have a routine and everybody who's trying to tell you in all their software developer videos I mean including mine to be honest like I made one and I said I showed that I have this perfect routine which at that time for that few months I kind of did but to be honest I wish life was like that because life is very messy like sometimes you are out there and boxing with your girlfriend and sometimes you're supporting your girlfriend after she has ran from Santa Monica to Las Vegas on barefoot oh cool crazy stuff but what's my point my point is that look life is not that straight forward it's pretty complicated and it's messy and overall I guess what I'm trying to say is that for software developers people always try to put us in a box nerds behind computers and that's all they do and yes while we are nerds and we love data and analytics and stuff with code we are human beings and we're also people who love to enjoy life and do activities and enjoy sports and all that kind of stuff right like when you look online people paint this picture which at least in my opinion most of the times it's like really boring and dull and I could never do that my life sounds kind of crazy there's all kinds of stuff I'm doing coding allows me to travel and be able to do all those things sup Naz there we go now dance all right come on bro let's go trick your [ __ ] let's do a challenge poop himself after it for human elevator for me ready me in the elevator okay let's go good okay let's do it Oh press it you press it like okay let's do it oh [ __ ] we gotta do this boys this elevator is slow as [ __ ] come on come on come on come on see here I don't think so guys I think we're gonna win I think we're gonna win how does it feel to lose Naz you know why his elevator was ready up so as long as Josie pressed it oh ha ha your velvet elevator was downstairs uhhuh sometimes I want to see my mom in Chicago sometimes my dad in Chicago or my family members all over you know California or whatever it may be and I can go ahead and do that while doing something I love which is coding and creating stuff taking out on my head and turning it into reality so when you aren't thinking about coding please also think about do you actually enjoy it and would you actually overcome all of those challenges because to become a developer that's something you really have to love I'm in Detroit Michigan with my boy nas yeah to do the course yeah we're shooting a prop of a JavaScript course and literally like living with me right now that's it yeah I'm actually living in it yeah but that's the cool thing about programming and software development I feel like it gives you that lifestyle to be able to do cool [ __ ] and I know that's why I like it why do you like it you do remote work and your discipline person all you can pretty much see go from nine to five you're not doing this there's no there's no one telling you what to do you get up when you want I can literally go like I go out like go to Bali right now is still work there's 20 fine what is the reason that you code what's your reason I want you to go ahead and comment that below and let me know what is your reason for doing it get up what you want
