00:00 - hey guys what's up this is Kazi from
00:02 - clever programmer calm where you learn
00:04 - to code smarter let's jump right into it
00:08 - today alright we're gonna be building
00:11 - the tic-tac-toe project I am so excited
00:15 - for this one I've been building up to
00:17 - this for so long and now you guys are
00:21 - gonna be on the same page with me and
00:22 - we're going to build a tic-tac-toe game
00:24 - alright so let's just get started
00:26 - so let's come here and before I start
00:29 - talking about any of this let's just
00:30 - start off with what it's going to look
00:32 - like when you're done building it okay
00:33 - and you're going to be able to share
00:35 - this with everybody so it's getting
00:37 - pretty simple and here's what it's going
00:38 - to look like all right not the fanciest
00:41 - thing you've ever seen but hey it's
00:42 - something so you have three choices
00:46 - rock-paper-scissors and you're playing
00:48 - against the computer okay so let's say
00:51 - we picked Rock the computer pick paper
00:53 - what just happened well paper beats Rock
00:56 - and so if you look at the computer score
00:58 - he got one and you still have zero you
01:00 - my friend are not a very good Rock Paper
01:02 - Scissors player let's try again
01:04 - alright we have to beat the computer so
01:07 - let's go Rock that's a tie that's pretty
01:10 - good I think that since the computer
01:13 - already picked Rock he's probably going
01:15 - to pick scissors next time so to prepare
01:19 - for scissors I'm gonna pick Rock boom
01:21 - listen okay so that was pretty awesome
01:27 - but that was not planned the game is not
01:30 - rigged at all it's supposed to be random
01:33 - but I'm pretty good at reading random
01:35 - computers let's see he picked scissors
01:38 - so maybe he's gonna pick scissors again
01:40 - let's stick with Rock oh he picked rock
01:42 - paper okay so he picked Rock we put
01:46 - picked paper we want we have a score of
01:48 - two the computer a score of one we can
01:52 - keep on going forever but I'm gonna end
01:53 - it for now okay so now let's talk about
01:57 - the actual project and what you need to
01:59 - do to get it to work as you can see here
02:03 - I have hidden these functions from you
02:06 - so choice two number number two choice
02:09 - random choice number and choice result
02:11 - those are the only four
02:13 - or functions that you need to complete
02:15 - in order to complete this entire project
02:18 - everything else I have done for you so
02:21 - you don't need to touch anything else
02:23 - okay you pretty much just need to
02:25 - complete those four functions and when
02:28 - you're done completing them your entire
02:30 - game will run another thing I've done to
02:33 - help you out is I've added some tasks so
02:36 - if you uncomment line 73 this line right
02:40 - here and run it and if your functions
02:43 - pass the test then most of your
02:45 - functions are correct some of the
02:47 - functions it's hard to write test for
02:49 - for example random computer choice if
02:51 - you're randomly generating choices it's
02:53 - kind of hard for me to test it all right
02:56 - so that one you kind of just have to do
02:58 - it correctly all right further
03:02 - explanation of the project so you have
03:04 - choice to number function what does that
03:06 - want well let's say I give you rock you
03:09 - should give me back one if I give you
03:11 - paper you should give me back two if I
03:13 - give you scissors you should give me
03:14 - back three all right what's the number
03:16 - choice functions job okay well if I give
03:19 - you a number like 1 you should give me
03:22 - back rock if I give you 2 you give me
03:24 - back paper and if I give you 3 you give
03:25 - me back scissors ok so both of those
03:28 - functions complement each other ok
03:30 - they're kind of the inverses of each
03:32 - other
03:32 - now let's talk about random computer
03:35 - choice function what does that do well
03:38 - the computer needs to be able to
03:40 - generate random choices ok so we need to
03:43 - use a random module that I've imported
03:46 - on line 5 I've also added some hints for
03:49 - you guys on how to use the random module
03:51 - so here if I show you guys the problem I
03:55 - have added some hints for you here ok so
03:57 - random computer choice so I want you to
04:01 - look up or random that choice does and
04:03 - how to use it in my solution video I'm
04:06 - gonna go through the whole solution so
04:08 - if you can figure it out you're going to
04:09 - learn anyways but I want you to be able
04:12 - to exercise some researching skills and
04:14 - develop your programs programmers
04:17 - ability of like solving things by
04:19 - researching it on google or Stack
04:21 - Overflow or something like that alright
04:22 - because that's important a lot of the
04:25 - times I'm on Stack Overflow Google
04:26 - trying
04:27 - figure out a problem so figure out how
04:29 - to use random that choice to make the
04:32 - computer randomly choose between rock
04:34 - paper and scissors okay let's go eat so
04:42 - it is just to give you a hint it's gonna
04:43 - be a one line solution like return
04:45 - random that choice and then pass in rock
04:49 - paper scissors computers going to return
04:50 - one of those every time okay
04:53 - now the choice result function is going
04:57 - to be the meat of the project that's
05:00 - going to be every it you know the whole
05:02 - logic of the project is pretty much
05:04 - going to be here so what's going on here
05:07 - well you have a computer score and human
05:09 - score which is up here the global
05:12 - variable maybe I'll explain that I'll
05:14 - explain that to you guys definitely in
05:16 - the solution but for now let's not worry
05:18 - so much about it just focus on not
05:20 - removing these lines when you come down
05:24 - here and you start coding this up well
05:26 - essentially what you're going to be
05:27 - doing in choice result is you're given
05:29 - the human choice and you're given the
05:30 - computer choice so using that you figure
05:34 - out who won so for example if human
05:36 - choice was rock and computer choice was
05:39 - paper well paper beats rock so in this
05:44 - case computer should win so actually I
05:48 - this should actually be this computer
05:55 - score is equal to like that okay so I'm
06:01 - sorry I had it wrong I'll fix it up when
06:03 - you guys get the link you'll have the
06:05 - fixed version so since paper beats rock
06:07 - computer score should be incremental by
06:09 - one whereas computer scores right here
06:11 - human score is also right here okay so
06:16 - then you can check hey if computer
06:19 - choice was I don't know whatever then
06:22 - you can increment based on that but what
06:24 - if it was a tie what if they both had
06:26 - the same thing well in that case you
06:28 - don't have to do any incrementing but
06:30 - you can just print tie or you don't even
06:33 - have to check for that condition okay so
06:35 - that's the simple answer to that
06:37 - how are you going to do choice result
06:40 - entirely up to you I would suggest doing
06:42 - bunch of if else if if type of
06:45 - statements okay so you're going to have
06:46 - bunch of if conditions you're going to
06:49 - check Rock against paper paper against
06:51 - rock what if human picks this and the
06:52 - computer picks that so you get to
06:57 - exercise some of your if-then statements
06:59 - there is a clever way of doing it which
07:02 - I will explain to you guys in the
07:03 - solution video but for now just use your
07:06 - if-then type of statements to do this
07:08 - okay choice the number number two choice
07:12 - I've kind of give you you guys an
07:13 - example of how to do it so you guys
07:17 - should be good on that and other than
07:21 - that I think you guys let's see what
07:23 - else I need to explain here
07:25 - test all yep just uncomment this and
07:29 - test some of your functions you know if
07:31 - you give choice number if you give it
07:32 - rock it should return zero if you give
07:34 - it paper it should return one and if I
07:36 - uh you know on the other hand bites
07:38 - first so pretty much number two choice
07:40 - if you give a zero it gives you rock if
07:41 - you give it one it should give you a
07:43 - paper everything else helps you all this
07:47 - stuff at the bottom is it helps make the
07:50 - GUI the graphical user interface of the
07:52 - project and it wraps up your logic in
07:55 - and makes it a part of the game okay
07:59 - so here if your code is not completed
08:01 - and you try to run the game you're gonna
08:03 - get back some stuff that that doesn't
08:06 - make much sense okay so it's not going
08:10 - to make sense but once you complete all
08:12 - of these functions the whole game is
08:14 - going to work perfectly and and you're
08:17 - gonna have essentially the game and it's
08:19 - gonna look like this okay all right guys
08:23 - hopefully that explains the entire
08:25 - project and what you need to do
08:26 - hopefully you have all the tools that
08:28 - you need to put this together and make
08:31 - the game if you make the game please put
08:35 - your links share your links using code
08:37 - sculptor you can click this button here
08:39 - that says save and when you hit save it
08:42 - generates a new link for you at the top
08:44 - okay so if I were to bring this guy down
08:47 - you can see it brought this link for me
08:50 - and you can go to that link and then see
08:53 - the entire code or play out the entire
08:55 - code okay sorry about that let's just
08:58 - bring this guy back at the top alright
09:02 - so that's how that works you generate
09:04 - that link post it in the comments below
09:06 - some of the things I want you guys to
09:08 - watch out for is if you hit command R or
09:11 - refresh it just removes the whole thing
09:15 - you have to be careful because code
09:17 - sculptor is in the browser and it
09:19 - doesn't save your code so if you hit
09:22 - save it'll give you that link and that
09:24 - link will help you but if you don't save
09:26 - and you hit refresh then all of your
09:28 - code just kind of goes away so watch out
09:30 - for refreshing randomly and yeah so safe
09:36 - continuous save a lot okay save
09:39 - constantly and then copy that link
09:42 - constantly so you can you can have that
09:45 - link just in case something bad happens
09:46 - okay and maybe even put this code
09:50 - locally gives you a download button so
09:52 - every few hours you're working on this
09:54 - maybe hit the download button so you can
09:56 - download it locally that way you're not
10:00 - in the risk of losing it okay after this
10:04 - we're going to work on some other really
10:06 - cool projects I have that in mind but
10:09 - for now focus all your energy on
10:11 - rock-paper-scissors let's get it done
10:13 - post your codes below post your links
10:15 - below
10:15 - I'll have the notes to this problem
10:17 - below and I'll have the solution to this
10:19 - problem below if you're watching it on
10:21 - youtube okay if you're not watching this
10:23 - on if you don't want to watch this on
10:25 - YouTube and do it directly on my website
10:26 - clever programmer calm go ahead and
10:28 - enroll in that school and there you can
10:30 - keep track of all of your progress and
10:33 - you can go there and all the resources
10:35 - will be there readily available alright
10:38 - guys good luck and I'll see you guys in
10:41 - the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys what's up this is Kazi from clever programmer calm where you learn to code smarter let's jump right into it today alright we're gonna be building the tictactoe project I am so excited for this one I've been building up to this for so long and now you guys are gonna be on the same page with me and we're going to build a tictactoe game alright so let's just get started so let's come here and before I start talking about any of this let's just start off with what it's going to look like when you're done building it okay and you're going to be able to share this with everybody so it's getting pretty simple and here's what it's going to look like all right not the fanciest thing you've ever seen but hey it's something so you have three choices rockpaperscissors and you're playing against the computer okay so let's say we picked Rock the computer pick paper what just happened well paper beats Rock and so if you look at the computer score he got one and you still have zero you my friend are not a very good Rock Paper Scissors player let's try again alright we have to beat the computer so let's go Rock that's a tie that's pretty good I think that since the computer already picked Rock he's probably going to pick scissors next time so to prepare for scissors I'm gonna pick Rock boom listen okay so that was pretty awesome but that was not planned the game is not rigged at all it's supposed to be random but I'm pretty good at reading random computers let's see he picked scissors so maybe he's gonna pick scissors again let's stick with Rock oh he picked rock paper okay so he picked Rock we put picked paper we want we have a score of two the computer a score of one we can keep on going forever but I'm gonna end it for now okay so now let's talk about the actual project and what you need to do to get it to work as you can see here I have hidden these functions from you so choice two number number two choice random choice number and choice result those are the only four or functions that you need to complete in order to complete this entire project everything else I have done for you so you don't need to touch anything else okay you pretty much just need to complete those four functions and when you're done completing them your entire game will run another thing I've done to help you out is I've added some tasks so if you uncomment line 73 this line

randomly generating choices it's kind of hard for me to test it all right so that one you kind of just have to do it correctly all right further explanation of the project so you have choice to number function what does that want well let's say I give you rock you should give me back one if I give you paper you should give me back two if I give you scissors you should give me back three all right what's the number choice functions job okay well if I give you a number like 1 you should give me back rock if I give you 2 you give me back paper and if I give you 3 you give me back scissors ok so both of those functions complement each other ok they're kind of the inverses of each other now let's talk about random computer choice function what does that do well the computer needs to be able to
