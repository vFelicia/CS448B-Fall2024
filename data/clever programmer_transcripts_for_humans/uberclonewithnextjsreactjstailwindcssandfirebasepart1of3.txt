04:01 - we're going to be building uber
04:03 - and you guys are going to be building
04:04 - these screens all right so that's a
04:06 - login screen with full user
04:08 - authentication
04:09 - once you log in you get to view the

08:44 - all right what do you guys think drop it
08:46 - down the chat in the chat well open up
08:48 - the terminal so for you guys open up
08:51 - your command line or terminal okay
08:53 - that's the first thing that we're
08:54 - actually going to go ahead and do here
08:57 - and what i'm going to do is i'm going to
09:00 - go into a folder so i just like to go
09:02 - into a folder called github that i have
09:05 - okay you don't need to go into any
09:06 - folders you can stay exactly where
09:08 - you're at okay yes
09:10 - and then
09:12 - what we want to do here is we want to
09:14 - type in a command
09:15 - all right and this command is a simple
09:17 - command that allows you to install
09:21 - this next project yeah let's install
09:24 - this project okay
09:25 - so so what you guys want to do is do npx
09:28 - it's called it is called npx create next
09:31 - app that's right npi create dash next
09:34 - app and then you do at latest
09:36 - yep so we're gonna do just like this
09:39 - cool now to how to be able to make this
09:41 - work you have to have npm installed and
09:43 - as we said yesterday you have to have
09:44 - npm installed so hopefully you guys got
09:46 - that installed yeah or notes installed
09:48 - sorry and you can try it and if you
09:49 - don't have it installed you can install
09:51 - it of course later on as well okay even
09:53 - after this video like if you at any
09:55 - point you just can't keep up and you're
09:57 - trying your hardest and you're like just
09:58 - getting frustrated you can just watch
10:01 - okay
10:02 - i would say keep trying to code along
10:04 - with us and if you just can't some point
10:06 - you can just watch all right and make
10:08 - sure you're kind of getting it that's
10:09 - the whole that's the whole idea
10:12 - okay cool and what's your project name
10:14 - i'm just gonna call it uber next
10:17 - clone
10:18 - okay just like that
10:20 - and i'm going to hit enter and now you
10:22 - see it's saying installing react react
10:24 - dom and next
10:27 - nice this is looking good
10:30 - yes on eslint so your sled is going to
10:32 - be for cleaning up your code
10:34 - yes
10:35 - uh if you guys have trouble with like
10:37 - hey what is um you if you said cd github
10:40 - and it didn't work that's okay that that
10:42 - command only works for me because i have
10:44 - a folder called github if you don't have
10:46 - that folder you don't even need to type
10:48 - in cd github you can just type in that
10:50 - npx command that we showed you
10:55 - beautiful next thing we want to do is we
10:57 - want to open up vs code and open open up
11:00 - our project cool
11:01 - so now i'm gonna go ahead and
11:05 - we're gonna i'm gonna open it up in my
11:08 - uh
11:09 - via cs
11:11 - beautiful okay
11:14 - if you want the the command let me go
11:16 - and get you the command npx create next
11:18 - app right here i got you
11:20 - boom
11:21 - okay
11:22 - so i just basically went into my vs code
11:25 - and i picked that folder all right so if
11:27 - i were to show you guys how you would do
11:30 - this
11:31 - is you would go to whichever folder you
11:33 - put it in here i'm going to click uber
11:35 - next clone
11:36 - and then i'm just going to hit open in
11:38 - my vs code and it's going to open that
11:40 - up right here okay
11:44 - beautiful
11:45 - and uh i'm gonna make nas and me a
11:48 - little bit smaller because i think we're
11:50 - taking up over like too much of the
11:51 - screen it's gonna
11:53 - stop you guys seeing
11:55 - some of the coding action that's
11:56 - happening so that's gonna be mad
11:59 - yeah
12:01 - okay awesome so i think uh that's good
12:04 - and now i'm gonna give access to nas so

13:36 - freaking out it's all good just watch
13:38 - along and you're gonna start getting it
13:40 - and picking it up
13:41 - uh
13:43 - cool
13:46 - somebody's like yeah the terminal is
13:47 - taking a long time to upload yeah
13:49 - that'll happen sometimes
13:52 - uh is this not working for you bro i got
13:54 - it i got it it's just taking some time
13:56 - okay thank god whoo
13:58 - are you in
13:59 - yeah yeah yeah i should see okay because
14:02 - it to me just says zero participants
14:05 - give me one second uh joined
14:08 - hey let's go and can you okay great so
14:11 - we've got that guys right we've got our
14:14 - application we've got two things we've
14:16 - got of course in the top left if you
14:17 - want to look at it if we don't do a
14:20 - shared server just yet let's not do that
14:21 - just yet let's go back to our file
14:23 - structure okay
14:25 - and you can see there's two there's a
14:26 - few things we've got we've got the pages
14:28 - folder we've got the public folder right
14:30 - there and we also got even uh what we've
14:33 - got the styles folder that's right the
14:36 - one that we're going to be working with
14:37 - right now is going to be the pages
14:38 - folder so if you go to the pages folder
14:41 - right there yeah and if you simply open
14:43 - up index.js so i feel like a bunch of
14:46 - people are asking what was the first
14:48 - step so let me just show it because i
14:50 - think bunch of people are getting stuck
14:51 - there so uh
14:54 - a lot of you guys are saying what was
14:55 - the first step so the first step was
14:57 - this we typed in literally the first
14:59 - thing you need to do
15:01 - right is i'm just going to go here and
15:03 - clear this up so it's clear
15:06 - the first thing that you're going to do
15:07 - is this npx create next app at latest
15:12 - just like that
15:14 - and that's going to install everything
15:15 - for you if this gives you errors this
15:17 - just means you don't have node installed
15:19 - the right way and make sure you have it
15:21 - installed the right way and then
15:22 - everything will work
15:23 - yes okay
15:25 - awesome
15:26 - um and then you essentially open that
15:29 - folder so this will create an app for
15:31 - you then you create then you open up
15:32 - that folder in visual studio code
15:36 - all right okay all right let's keep
15:38 - going nas
15:39 - beautiful okay
15:40 - after that
15:41 - we want to do is we want to open up the
15:43 - terminal here so you can do
15:45 - open terminal all right here we go
15:49 - there we go and you can do npm
15:52 - space fun space dev
15:56 - all right
16:00 - there we go beautiful so looks like
16:02 - you've got we've got us a and now you
16:04 - want to open this one up
16:06 - okay here we go
16:10 - there we go open up let me zoom out
16:13 - all right so this is if you are able to
16:16 - get to this point you have your very
16:18 - first
16:19 - uh react slash next app up and running
16:22 - okay so congratulations if you've made
16:24 - it or if you haven't made it it's okay
16:26 - you can rewatch it and make it up to
16:28 - here
16:28 - yes yes yes yes so at this point guys
16:31 - this is your first
16:32 - application right it's the starter
16:34 - application but of course we're going to
16:36 - modify this now okay so if we go into
16:39 - our pages folder and if we go in to our
16:42 - index.js
16:44 - yeah we can do that right now okay so
16:47 - let's go into pages folder and let's go
16:49 - into index
16:50 - beautiful
16:52 - okay
16:53 - and you can see that there's all of
16:55 - these things we've got the head we've
16:57 - got the main
16:58 - and this is literally like html except
17:01 - just to give you guys some context in
17:03 - next gs react.js it's actually called
17:06 - jsx which is basically html but for
17:09 - javascript okay so just has a different
17:12 - name okay yeah now we're going to do
17:14 - first is we need to remove all of this
17:16 - in terms of remove everything from head
17:18 - where you see the head and i'm going to
17:19 - go all the way down i'm going to remove
17:22 - all the way down to the footer right
17:24 - here so we don't need all any of this
17:26 - stuff right here okay this is what your
17:27 - file should look like after you're done
17:30 - exactly exactly then you want to go
17:32 - ahead and click save right and at this
17:34 - point your application should look like
17:36 - nothing i'm going to go i'm going to go
17:38 - ahead and open up my localhost so i can
17:40 - see what i'm seeing from your site
17:42 - beautiful and inside here which you can
17:44 - just say stuff like for example you know
17:46 - i can say the header right and if you
17:49 - run this if you save this
17:51 - it should technically show the header
17:52 - for you right there okay yeah so now if
17:55 - you look at our application right now
17:56 - let's go back to our application okay uh
17:59 - the pre-built one the right the one
18:01 - that's already been built let's go ahead
18:02 - and sign in with google kazi
18:05 - all right
18:07 - and what do we see
18:09 - go sign up with google
18:13 - now when i see applications guys i see
18:16 - what i see boxes literally in life your
18:20 - life is made of small boxes in terms of
18:22 - coding wise okay so if you see a box
18:24 - here what are some boxes do you see
18:26 - right here guys okay let's think about
18:28 - this well we've got one box that's the
18:30 - map
18:31 - okay and then we got another box that's
18:33 - going to be the bottom section right
18:35 - that's going to be the that's going to
18:36 - contain your buttons going to contain
18:38 - your header
18:39 - everything right so the reason why i do
18:42 - that and this is very very important is
18:45 - because this allows me to build html
18:47 - structure remember how we said that html
18:49 - is like a bonus right well i'm literally
18:52 - looking and how the bones are built
18:55 - right just by looking at it like that
18:57 - okay so if we have the map you can see
18:59 - i'm gonna go and create create this div
19:01 - called map
19:03 - div right here and inside here i'm gonna
19:05 - say map right that's gonna be my fault
19:07 - my first thing yeah and that i'm going
19:09 - to say here
19:11 - div right here and i'm going to say i'm
19:13 - going to call this the let's just say
19:15 - the start section okay
19:18 - boom so you can see if we go back to our
19:20 - application we have two things map and
19:23 - start yep all right beautiful and there
19:25 - are two like little boxes
19:28 - yeah they're just two little boxes and
19:29 - i'll show you exactly why they're how
19:31 - they are little boxes
19:32 - if i go back to my uh
19:35 - css actually it's uh inside the home the
19:37 - mod of the css you could click on that
19:39 - one maybe maybe you can follow my code
19:41 - can you click follow me somehow or no
19:43 - yeah i can
19:44 - i'm following you
19:49 - yeah is it good yeah yeah okay beautiful
19:52 - all right so if i go back i'm going to
19:53 - go back minus the js i'm going to give
19:55 - this a class name yeah
19:58 - for now
19:59 - and because i just want to show you
20:00 - exactly what we're looking for right i'm
20:02 - going to call it styles
20:04 - dot let's just call it a map
20:07 - yeah and inside this day i'm gonna say
20:09 - class name
20:11 - is equal to right here
20:13 - styles dot start okay right there's and
20:17 - we we give this like class name because
20:20 - remember in order for us to style
20:21 - something we need to have a class name
20:24 - okay yeah i go back to my home damage
20:27 - that's my module.css and i will actually
20:30 - create those so like i said we created
20:32 - the map one boom
20:34 - and then we're gonna create the start
20:37 - one right like so
20:40 - okay i will go ahead and create a
20:41 - background color
20:43 - here and i'm gonna call it a red
20:47 - yeah right right you guys can see right
20:48 - away right we've got the red color if i
20:50 - go to start i'm going to give this a
20:52 - background color
20:53 - of what green
20:56 - oop not green green no
20:58 - beautiful right so now we've got those
21:00 - two things right now let's think about
21:02 - okay how do we now make sure that all
21:04 - this you see remember how we built these
21:06 - two boxes one top and one bottom right
21:09 - so how do we make it in a way where they
21:12 - fill up the whole screen
21:14 - that's an interesting portion right
21:16 - well this is where we have a height for
21:19 - example if i go to my container here and
21:21 - i say height
21:23 - i can say 100 vh okay and check this out
21:26 - this is called 100
21:27 - vertical height pay attention i'm going
21:30 - to give the background color let's just
21:31 - say uh background background color oh
21:34 - let's just say blue for now so you guys
21:36 - can see exactly what i'm talking about
21:38 - oops blue
21:40 - beautiful
21:42 - there we go you guys can see so without
21:44 - this height of 100 vh basically nothing
21:47 - will happen and it will just be like
21:49 - this
21:49 - yeah you see but if i say a height of
21:52 - 100 vh
21:54 - now is the full height yeah yeah okay
21:57 - now how do we make sure that this all
21:59 - these now take up the same amount of
22:01 - screen real estate this is where we you
22:04 - use something called display flex and
22:06 - you can know this down somewhere you
22:07 - know somewhere in your notepad but
22:10 - flexbox is a very important tool you're
22:12 - going to use just in general as a
22:14 - developer right it's what is what allows
22:16 - us to create like structures you know
22:18 - like facebook for example uses flexbox
22:20 - netflix uses flexbox everybody uses
22:22 - flexbox to be able to structure things
22:25 - yeah so if i could display flex here
22:28 - boom
22:29 - beautiful
22:30 - after that okay don't worry don't worry
22:32 - don't worry both faces in a second here
22:33 - we'll say flex direction you change
22:35 - direction to b column
22:39 - right here column and now it's column
22:42 - flex direction and now what i'm going to
22:44 - do
22:45 - is because of this i'm going to give my
22:47 - map a flat and i'm explaining this a
22:49 - second here flags of one
22:51 - boom
22:52 - right you see will take up a lot of
22:54 - space and then i say start
22:56 - also guys flags of one
23:00 - boom
23:01 - so what just happened here
23:03 - right remember basically what we did is
23:06 - we gave our map so our map right here we
23:09 - give this you know
23:10 - when i say flex of one it means
23:12 - basically
23:14 - the weight the importance of that div
23:16 - that container
23:18 - and then our start also has the same
23:20 - weight or the importance so if they both
23:23 - have the same you know the same amount
23:25 - of weight that means they will what
23:27 - they'll be split 50 50. correct yes or
23:30 - no yeah 50 50. yeah right if i give the
23:33 - start of 0.5 check this out what do you
23:36 - think will be smaller right if i say 0.5
23:39 - what do you think yeah the star one
23:41 - let me ask you this what if i say this
23:42 - is flex 0.5 then which one will be
23:45 - smaller here's my question to you
23:47 - dropped in the chat i'm really curious
23:49 - which will be smaller if i put flex 0.5
23:52 - for the map which one
23:54 - hey that's a good that's a good one guys
23:57 - exactly it will be the same so if i
23:58 - flick 0.5
24:00 - i'm saying
24:01 - they are the same importance got it so
24:04 - guys this is what we created on this
24:06 - point right it's all good and dandy
24:08 - that's exactly what we want but of
24:10 - course it's not application
24:12 - the next thing i'm gonna do guys is the
24:13 - following i'm gonna go back to instags
24:16 - and what i want to understand is yes
24:18 - this is not the uber clown at this point
24:22 - but because i don't want to go further
24:24 - using css at this point we're done using
24:26 - css
24:28 - we're going to be using now styled
24:30 - components
24:31 - what i just showed you just one way to
24:32 - create styles which is an amazing way
24:35 - but now what i'm going to show you is
24:36 - how do we create style components use
24:38 - style components to create amazing css
24:41 - ready for this
24:42 - ready quasi yeah let's do it beautiful
24:45 - all right so the first thing we're going
24:46 - to create is we need to install tailwind
24:50 - css okay can you or can you go to google
24:53 - please and type in uh tailwind css
24:57 - or tailway style components there we go
24:59 - yep so
25:00 - if you type in tailwind
25:03 - uh
25:04 - tailwind style components right is that
25:05 - what you said that's right
25:08 - tailwind styled components here we go
25:12 - cool
25:13 - yes
25:14 - let's click the first one
25:16 - that's what i'll do
25:17 - that's we're going to use
25:19 - then you guys want to go ahead and
25:20 - scroll all the way down
25:22 - go all the way down and there's the
25:24 - install
25:25 - not all the way down sorry that's two
25:26 - that's too much let's go a little bit up
25:28 - now this is the one right yeah now
25:30 - scroll up a little bit more scroll up
25:32 - uh-huh
25:36 - up stop stop stop stop stop
25:39 - right here scroll a little bit down
25:41 - and there you will see so if you scroll
25:43 - yeah they go beautiful if you scroll and
25:44 - then you see how this is the code you
25:46 - want to run but we're not going to run
25:47 - this just yet because we need to install
25:49 - tail and css separately so there's a
25:51 - button there tail and css you see that
25:53 - button it says install tail and css in
25:55 - the little
25:57 - font that's italic
25:58 - it's like italic font on the bottom on
26:00 - the bottom uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
26:02 - let's see there we go cool so i'll click
26:04 - that
26:05 - beautiful and then you guys can just
26:07 - even probably type in install tailwind
26:10 - css into google and come to the same
26:12 - page
26:13 - yeah click next yes at this point cool
26:17 - and there you go this is what we need to
26:18 - type in so the first thing you type in
26:20 - is gonna be the npm install which is
26:22 - this npm install dash g section you see
26:25 - that quasi
26:27 - got it so
26:28 - uh wait hold on hold on
26:31 - npm and saw dash g
26:33 - yeah right there
26:34 - or dash oh whatever this says right
26:36 - there
26:37 - oh and dash d sorry npm is still there
26:39 - this is the one right that's the one
26:41 - again yes okay okay got it
26:43 - all right cool so we're going to copy
26:44 - this one yeah all right let's go ahead
26:47 - and then this is the one that we're
26:48 - going to install with
26:50 - that's the first one yes cool
26:52 - so here we go let's hit so just copy
26:55 - paste that into your command line in
26:57 - this folder hit enter and that's going
26:59 - to start the installation process for
27:00 - that okay
27:05 - uh i guess for future if you guys want
27:06 - to build your app you should probably
27:08 - just do this this will make it easy to
27:10 - install uh taylormade by default
27:13 - yeah yeah that might be pretty good yeah
27:15 - okay cool and then what's next this one
27:18 - over here
27:19 - exactly then you want to do it exactly
27:21 - you want to do that one next okay cool
27:23 - so let's paste that one that's going to
27:24 - be the next thing that we want to
27:26 - install
27:28 - all right so now it's created a css
27:30 - config file
27:32 - beautiful and you can actually see on
27:33 - the left hand side there's a css config
27:35 - file that's been created for you
27:37 - yep right here that's right and then if
27:39 - you scroll all the way if you scroll
27:41 - more down now in the actual browser so
27:44 - go the browser back to the browser now
27:47 - scroll down you see where it says
27:49 - configure tail want to remove unused
27:51 - styles and production yeah there we go
27:53 - and that purge you see that purge the
27:55 - plus for the purge yeah i'm gonna copy
27:57 - that section
27:59 - and just paste it over that
28:01 - exactly paste it over that purge in the
28:03 - tail without configuring yes so before
28:05 - purge was empty you guys and now we just
28:07 - added these things inside of it
28:11 - yes cool
28:13 - good awesome good beautiful so we've got
28:16 - that okay and then at that point we're
28:19 - pretty pretty much done the one last
28:21 - thing i want you to do is you see how it
28:22 - says
28:24 - scroll down a little bit and it says
28:25 - import till and directly in your gs yep
28:28 - so take this guys and this is the page
28:30 - we want to import it in so go to pages
28:33 - slash so underscore app.js all right
28:36 - all right here
28:38 - and inside here you want to import that
28:39 - exactly yep perfect so i'm going to go
28:41 - here and i'm just going to paste it so
28:43 - that's good
28:44 - beautiful
28:46 - all right and is this it or do i need to
28:48 - do any of this stuff here not yet so
28:51 - that's pretty much that's almost done
28:52 - we've got one last step guys okay let's
28:55 - go back to our initial npm where we
28:57 - fought where we found style components
28:59 - gives you if you hit the back button
29:01 - kazi
29:02 - oh there we go beautiful and then now
29:04 - you want to install the npm i the whole
29:07 - npm i one there we go okay cool so let's
29:10 - go ahead and do that let's copy paste so
29:13 - tailwind has a multiple steps guys to
29:15 - get it to work let's uh to install it so
29:17 - we installed tailwind and now we're
29:19 - going to do tailwind
29:20 - with style components
29:22 - exactly exactly
29:24 - so
29:25 - just to be clear guys so those who don't
29:27 - know raise your hand or raise your hand
29:29 - or just
29:30 - drop in the chat if you don't know what
29:31 - tailwind is
29:32 - like who does not know what tailwind is
29:34 - you probably don't know probably a lot
29:36 - of people don't know so
29:38 - tailwind is like a it's like a css
29:40 - library
29:42 - that basically like combines a few css
29:45 - styles because css is like the core
29:47 - right that's like the core that's like
29:48 - the core that makes everything work yeah
29:50 - um tailwind then is uses those core that
29:54 - core library to go ahead and give you
29:56 - some functionality to make it easier for
29:58 - you to style things it's kind of like
29:59 - bootstrap a little bit yeah i don't
30:01 - think if you heard it before
30:03 - yeah yeah it just makes it easier for
30:05 - you to write your css okay
30:08 - exactly exactly exactly so you installed
30:11 - that that seems to be a little good and
30:13 - now at this point we're pretty much done
30:14 - if you scroll if you keep scrolling to
30:16 - the bottom in that uh on that page it
30:18 - will tell you how do you use this it
30:19 - says import tw uh-huh so copy that yeah
30:24 - and let's use it inside our index.js
30:26 - instead our index.js import that there
30:29 - cool
30:30 - beautiful and guys that's it
30:33 - so now here's the cool part let's go
30:34 - ahead and check out how we go ahead and
30:36 - use now tailwind all right
30:38 - now if you follow me along here instead
30:40 - of using divs now we're gonna use style
30:42 - components so it's kind of like we're
30:44 - creating our own div names
30:47 - yeah watch it
30:48 - right i'm going to say the following i'm
30:49 - going to say a wrapper
30:51 - okay
30:52 - and i'm going to close this out with the
30:53 - wrapper
30:56 - boom of course it's going to break not
30:58 - enough is going to work don't worry
31:00 - now i'm going to create that style
31:01 - component i'm going to say const wrapper
31:05 - is equal to tw dot div
31:07 - we're using the tw that's from here the
31:09 - top
31:10 - right and we're creating the div here
31:12 - and we're using backticks so what these
31:14 - chords called are these are called
31:16 - backticks so they're not quotes be
31:18 - careful with that because a lot of you
31:19 - guys will probably miss
31:21 - miss it right they're back they're like
31:23 - on the left section of your keyboard
31:25 - yeah all right
31:26 - i'm gonna save this now and you can see
31:28 - it's it's kind of working right now
31:29 - right it's kind of there right yeah and
31:32 - it's not even broken that's the cool
31:33 - part
31:34 - also instead of me using this div class
31:36 - name styles map i'm going to say map
31:39 - oop map and i'm going to close that with
31:41 - a map as well
31:43 - boom yeah right instead of doing that
31:46 - start i'm going to say for example i'm
31:48 - going to call this a different name i'm
31:49 - going to say here
31:50 - it's called a action button so i'm going
31:52 - to just call it a little bit differently
31:54 - which is completely okay right they're
31:56 - going to be called action let me see one
31:57 - second it's going to be called action
32:00 - items actually actually items sorry
32:02 - action items
32:04 - action
32:06 - items beautiful and we'll close it up
32:08 - with action items as well
32:13 - of course it's not there yet so we need
32:14 - to go ahead and const
32:16 - action items equals to tw that div so
32:19 - every time you create a
32:21 - div like you know like action items or
32:24 - whatever basically you have to create e
32:27 - specify it using tw.div right yeah now
32:31 - it might be asking question okay i'm
32:32 - going to save this
32:35 - construction map can you go ahead and uh
32:38 - handle runtime error
32:40 - can you refresh it uh yeah sure refresh
32:46 - okay server error requires new
32:53 - [Music]
32:59 - the chrysler constructor map requires
33:02 - new
33:05 - oh that's why we have it we didn't do
33:07 - the map on guys
33:08 - const map
33:10 - as well map is equal to tw
33:13 - that div
33:16 - there we go that's why yep
33:19 - cool
33:20 - beautiful nice let's go
33:22 - beautiful let's go the app is done
33:25 - hey guys thank you so much for watching
33:27 - we'll see you guys in the next one

35:34 - maybe we could try that okay try
35:36 - stopping it and starting it again npm
35:39 - run dev
35:40 - uh let's give it a try so
35:43 - restart
35:47 - hey
35:49 - let's go everybody give it up for david
35:52 - let's go david
35:53 - yeah
35:56 - let's go guys if you have issues like
35:59 - that just go ahead and restart the app
36:02 - quit it out of it and how do you query
36:03 - you said like control c right or control
36:05 - x to quit out of it right uh yeah ctrl c
36:08 - and then just start the run the command
36:10 - again npm run dev
36:12 - that's right and all that is on the
36:13 - terminal guys if you're wondering okay
36:15 - yeah so here's what we did we created
36:17 - the flex we made this wrapper flex we
36:19 - give it a bj red 300 right or let's just
36:21 - uh bg 300 i'm going to you know how we
36:24 - did the whole height screen i'm gonna
36:26 - say h dash screen which represents the
36:29 - height of a 100 vh
36:31 - okay there we go beautiful right and
36:33 - then after that right that's pretty much
36:35 - all we have to do
36:36 - let's look at our map now and with our
36:39 - map we want to give it a flex of one
36:42 - like so
36:43 - which will have them take up as much
36:45 - space as possible and the same is going
36:46 - to happen with the action items right
36:49 - i'm going to give it a flex of dash one
36:55 - now we have map and start so it's
36:57 - exactly the same thing guys as we did
36:59 - the last time capisce
37:02 - capisce beautiful ever understand that
37:04 - so like i said we have flex of one which
37:06 - basically specifies that it's the same
37:08 - weight as the other one guys okay all
37:11 - right so we've got those two things
37:12 - beautiful the next thing guys we're
37:14 - going to work on quasi is what
37:17 - ha you said the next thing

41:09 - need to link your style she says you see
41:11 - how it says link shrek you see that
41:14 - where
41:15 - uh on the on the right include the gljs
41:18 - css file you see that uh-huh copy this
41:20 - no we don't want to copy this we want to
41:22 - do it a little bit differently here
41:24 - because we're using next yes so i gave
41:27 - you the specific code kazi in slack it's
41:30 - called import mapbox gl
41:36 - okay
41:37 - so you want to go ahead and copy that
41:39 - you want to go
41:40 - back to your um app.js guys app.js
41:44 - and then
41:45 - under here
41:47 - then you want to import uh mapbox
41:50 - gl
41:51 - got it okay
41:53 - okay you got it beautiful
41:55 - at that point we're pretty much done
41:57 - pretty much done do we also import this
41:59 - too no no that's gonna be later okay
42:02 - cool yes stop that now hit next on the
42:05 - right section like where you see next in
42:07 - map box
42:08 - okay
42:09 - yes
42:11 - okay now we've got a few things okay you
42:13 - see this bomb mattebox glue because
42:15 - required we don't need that this is
42:17 - where now we import mapbox so let's go
42:19 - back to index.js
42:21 - okay let's go
42:23 - okay and there we're going to import
42:26 - mapbox i'm gonna do this right now okay
42:28 - so give me one second here
42:30 - i'm gonna do this right now for you okay
42:34 - so it's literally just called macbook gl
42:36 - like so
42:41 - like
42:42 - boom so
42:43 - right here okay
42:45 - boom so map gl from mapbox gl okay
42:48 - that's gonna be our macbook gl next i'm
42:51 - gonna do is we're gonna create our uh
42:53 - token so in the specific token and i
42:56 - have a token here but on the right hand
42:58 - side it will show your token
43:00 - as you guys can see in your uh
43:05 - okay it says i don't turn my string
43:07 - constant let's see let's see let's see
43:09 - it's okay you can just do it like this
43:10 - because i forgot to put a beautiful
43:14 - okay okay one second let me go and copy
43:16 - the token properly because i didn't copy
43:17 - it well okay do you want me to use my
43:19 - token or no
43:20 - no i got it okay
43:22 - beautiful all right
43:24 - different token here okay so the token
43:26 - you see on the right side you see how
43:27 - you have you guys have a token on the
43:28 - right hand side um yeah that's the one
43:31 - you want to copy so you want to do matte
43:32 - box gl access token copy that whole
43:35 - thing and paste it exactly where i just
43:37 - showed you yeah right here just like
43:38 - this yes okay done well cost says done
43:42 - wait what cause
43:44 - that's not no no no no no
43:45 - [Laughter]
43:46 - [Music]
43:50 - uh
43:52 - my my brother's name is wakas that's why
43:54 - there you go
43:56 - beautiful so we've got our token guys
43:58 - the reason why we have a token is
43:59 - because this allows madbox to know that
44:01 - hey you know what you are a real person
44:03 - okay
44:05 - yeah now for that after that what we
44:06 - want to do is we want to now create uh
44:09 - our map box now it's a little bit
44:10 - different now
44:11 - as you can see that you see how it says
44:13 - um new map shell that map all that stuff
44:17 - that's not gonna create so inside here
44:19 - yeah
44:21 - we're gonna do like this we're gonna say
44:23 - const map equals new map box stop map
44:26 - like this
44:30 - right here okay don't worry about this
44:32 - so far now this is gonna work
44:36 - we don't want this right now okay
44:38 - okay beautiful now you basically can
44:40 - copy everything that you have on the
44:42 - right hand side near that specific uh
44:44 - what's it called
44:47 - map yeah if you can copy this that's
44:49 - completely fine okay
44:50 - so you can don't worry about it
44:53 - let me see
44:54 - yeah beautiful
44:55 - um
44:56 - next thing we want to do guys is this is
44:58 - a map but it's not really going to work
45:00 - initially because we need to use a
45:02 - different type of style to to make this
45:04 - work now what i mean by that you see we
45:06 - initialize the map this initializes our
45:09 - whole map
45:10 - okay yeah but
45:12 - in our application in next gslash
45:14 - reactor yes
45:16 - in order to initiate something to start
45:18 - the application we use something called
45:19 - use effect
45:21 - that's right so i'm going to import
45:23 - something called use effect import
45:27 - use
45:28 - effect
45:29 - from react you guys can see it right
45:31 - here in the on the on the top
45:33 - okay let's save this right here this is
45:35 - what we got okay
45:36 - and then at that point we're gonna use
45:38 - use effect so use effect
45:42 - boom
45:43 - okay
45:44 - the next thing we're gonna do we're
45:45 - gonna do we're gonna create a function
45:47 - like this
45:49 - and i'm gonna specify that it's a
45:51 - something that's gonna load in the
45:53 - beginning of replication so just to give
45:55 - you guys some context
45:56 - use effect is something that's gonna be
45:59 - uh conglold and whenever your
46:01 - application loads for the first time so
46:03 - if i do console.log
46:04 - yeah
46:06 - log and i say hello
46:10 - all right and i save it okay can you
46:12 - maybe go to the application qazi yeah
46:17 - let's go to the application boom yeah
46:20 - and if you right-click inspect element
46:21 - can you try that yeah there we go okay
46:23 - let's go console
46:25 - beautiful and yeah i see hello right
46:27 - there yeah you can see guys that's hello
46:29 - right and that's only ran the first time
46:32 - that your application gets loaded and
46:33 - that's what we need to do with the map
46:35 - right now i'm going to send you a link
46:36 - here really quickly here okay so i'm
46:38 - going to say map box here essentially
46:39 - link really quickly macbooks using um
46:45 - right here so i'll send you guys this
46:47 - link really quickly
46:49 - you guys can go check this out i'll give
46:50 - you this in slack okay this will give
46:53 - you guys some context on how to use
46:55 - mapbox and react can you go go ahead and
46:57 - open that one up sure
47:00 - all right there we go
47:02 - beautiful i know it's like imitation
47:03 - guys but this is just something you have
47:04 - to learn when you you know get into this
47:06 - okay
47:07 - now let's scroll down scroll down scroll
47:10 - down scroll down scroll down
47:12 - and you will see something called source
47:14 - app.js
47:16 - how do you add mapbox gl to yes right
47:18 - there at the bottom
47:20 - just scroll down okay
47:26 - scrolling
47:28 - there we go keep scrolling yeah and
47:29 - there you have user so skip scroll a
47:31 - little bit more uh-huh
47:33 - there we go and now we get the user fact
47:34 - you everybody see that
47:36 - it actually tells you exactly how to do
47:38 - that right there you see no uh right
47:39 - there use effect
47:41 - okay right there yep got it beautiful
47:43 - yes so that's what we want to do but
47:45 - we're going to do a little bit
47:46 - differently right so we can copy this
47:47 - it's going to copy this quasi uh-huh
47:50 - copied it
47:51 - okay
47:52 - and then go back to our piece of code
47:55 - yeah
47:56 - beautiful and replace it with a used
47:59 - effect with the user effect that we
48:00 - currently have
48:01 - okay beautiful hey beautiful and i'm
48:04 - gonna work with this now okay so we
48:06 - don't need this map.current
48:08 - no don't need none of that
48:10 - okay and so i'm just going to say const
48:13 - map here
48:14 - const map that's going to create our map
48:17 - here
48:18 - this right here container is basically
48:20 - it's going to look for hey where am i
48:22 - going to put my map right what id
48:26 - now
48:27 - to to enter that i if i you look at me i
48:30 - have this map section right here i'm
48:31 - going to give it an id is equal to map
48:34 - yeah
48:35 - right here i can remove this map section
48:37 - right here now this map basically is
48:40 - going to
48:41 - say hey you know what this is where you
48:43 - put
48:44 - your actual map box
48:45 - so instead of doing map continue the
48:47 - current i'm going to say
48:49 - map
48:50 - okay
48:51 - the styles that's completely fine
48:54 - okay for latitude longitude i have a
48:56 - specific lab to launch it's like the
48:57 - center of the united states i can copy
48:59 - and paste this for you guys maybe you
49:00 - guys can copy pixels for you as well
49:02 - it's like -99 right here 39 you guys can
49:06 - copy and paste it for you if you guys on
49:07 - youtube or if you're on on zoom i can
49:09 - even do it for you right now as well so
49:11 - you can all have it all right so let's
49:12 - go ahead and do that right now
49:14 - boom
49:16 - all right then the zoom what do you guys
49:18 - think this zoom does okay what do you
49:20 - think this represents you guys tell them
49:22 - in the chat but you guys think this
49:23 - represents who can tell me
49:24 - what do you think this represents the
49:26 - zoom portion
49:28 - but tell me what is represent
49:30 - that's right it's just a zoom tool but
49:32 - it's basically the zoom number so i'm
49:34 - going to remove this zoom number
49:38 - boom and i'll just give it a three
49:41 - yep you guys are yes
49:48 - there we go
49:50 - that's beautiful
49:52 - i know right so go ahead and close out
49:53 - your uh console console log your inspect
49:56 - element please yeah beautiful by the way
49:59 - i see you guys guessing it correctly in
50:00 - there in the chat you guys were saying
50:02 - you guys know what the zoom is so nice
50:04 - job on that yeah good job everybody so
50:07 - look everything is good all right so
50:09 - this is our first section but of course
50:10 - you guys can see that maybe this map
50:12 - looks a little bit different than we
50:14 - usually look uh what we first showed you
50:16 - it's because there's a different style
50:18 - you see this right here this this style
50:20 - we want to have by the way this is the
50:22 - style that we want
50:23 - so i have a different style right here
50:25 - i'm going to copy this for you
50:27 - and paste it in for you right here
50:30 - well
50:31 - it's a different style i'll paste it in
50:33 - for you and zoom guys if you want to
50:34 - check it out yeah this is the style here
50:36 - we'll paste it in zoom and a monother
50:38 - somebody if you guys can paste it on
50:40 - youtube as well so if somebody needs it
50:42 - they can have it
50:44 - exactly
50:45 - so now you guys can see that the map
50:47 - looks very different yeah yeah that's
50:49 - that yeah it looks very very very
50:51 - different so the map guys is done it is
50:54 - done we can remove all this section we
50:56 - don't need any of this right here
50:58 - right
50:59 - we can save this and our map is pretty
51:01 - good now i'm going to do this now a
51:02 - little bit differently guys now one of
51:03 - the coolest things about
51:05 - nextgs that you can do is the fact that
51:08 - you guys can create something called
51:09 - components and who can who can tell me
51:10 - what are components what do you guys
51:12 - think who can tell me
51:14 - what are components if you guys are in
51:16 - zoom what are components
51:19 - what are components huh
51:24 - components
51:27 - what can tell me
51:28 - it's a piece of code that's right
51:30 - reusable ui element a part on your app
51:32 - parts of a whole yeah that's a good way
51:34 - to think about it
51:36 - beautiful it's a reusable ui element
51:38 - right so it's like almost like you use
51:40 - the same
51:41 - kind of little structure block to be
51:43 - able to use in multiple places so for
51:45 - the map because we're gonna be using
51:47 - multiple places guys i'm going to create
51:49 - a component for this right away
51:51 - so if we go back to pages if you go to
51:53 - the pages section you click right new
51:55 - for a click and you click new file
51:58 - uh and and okay our new folder in your
52:01 - folder and create that called the
52:03 - components okay we're going to put that
52:05 - inside of pages right metal pages you
52:07 - guys can see already created right here
52:08 - well okay okay you created it while i
52:10 - was creating it so i'm going to delete
52:12 - mine cool there we go okay
52:14 - so then i'm going to create inside here
52:16 - i'm going to create a new file right
52:18 - click a new file and i'll say map dot js
52:21 - guys
52:21 - boom
52:23 - that's our map now okay that's gonna be
52:26 - our component there's nothing in here so
52:28 - to really quickly create a component i'm
52:30 - gonna say r a f c e and this is a really
52:33 - cool um kind of you know a handy dandy
52:36 - tool what is the tool called uh cozy do
52:38 - you know uh it's like extensions so it's
52:41 - uh if you go into
52:44 - uh if you wanna install this extension
52:47 - it's like is co is uh react.js code s7
52:50 - it's like yeah snippets and stuff like
52:52 - that so it's this one right here es7
52:54 - react redux snippets and then you can do
52:57 - rafce and then essentially just makes a
53:00 - component for you right off the bat
53:03 - exactly beautiful
53:04 - so within this at this point we're gonna
53:06 - i'm going to go back to my index.js and
53:08 - i will import a lot of stuff that i need
53:10 - of course i'm going to import my
53:12 - tailwind and my my map box as well we'll
53:15 - copy all of that i will go back to
53:17 - mata.js i will use it i will also import
53:22 - import use effect that's we're going to
53:24 - use inside
53:26 - here you could just do it over here i
53:29 - think
53:30 - huh
53:31 - you could do it up here but that's fine
53:33 - yeah i can just i don't need the react
53:35 - portion at all honestly
53:37 - right so got that and then i'm pretty
53:39 - much going to do the same thing i did
53:40 - before because remember i'm going to
53:43 - create this div called wrapper
53:46 - right
53:49 - wrapper i'm going to give an id is equal
53:51 - to math
53:55 - they're like looks like uh david rokosi
53:57 - had a hand in that styling
53:59 - yes
54:00 - yes he did what's up david
54:02 - let's go dude he had a lot of hand in
54:05 - building this app actually behind the
54:06 - scenes oh yeah oh yeah he did it
54:10 - everybody yeah let's go
54:17 - all right
54:18 - okay the developer in the shadows
54:22 - true that through that i will go ahead
54:25 - and import this map.gl access token so
54:27 - go ahead and copy all of that
54:29 - or or actually cut it go back to my gs
54:32 - we're going to use it now here
54:34 - okay
54:36 - okay
54:37 - right again we're just making it a
54:39 - little bit more diverse another is a
54:40 - little bit more kind of componentized i
54:42 - like to call it right after that i will
54:44 - copy this user effect because i don't
54:46 - need this insight here i will command
54:48 - exit i will cut it
54:50 - put it into the map section
54:52 - boom boom boom
54:54 - use effect beautiful save it
54:58 - okay
54:59 - okay and then let's go back to my app.js
55:02 - oh it is sorry
55:04 - and i don't really need this at this
55:05 - point right this whole map thing i don't
55:07 - even need this either you know even this
55:09 - at this point now
55:12 - instead of doing map i actually import
55:14 - the whole component i will say import
55:17 - map
55:19 - see and then right away told me that
55:21 - it's inside the components.map right so
55:22 - we create this component we're going to
55:24 - import it now instead of doing this i'll
55:26 - just simply say like this
55:30 - save
55:31 - so let's see will it work will it work
55:33 - let me see let me see it says fail to
55:35 - compile it's okay
55:37 - and if our map has already been declared
55:39 - it's okay because if we scroll here guys
55:41 - you guys can see we have this const map
55:43 - we don't need this remove this
55:47 - save it boom okay wrapper is not defined
55:50 - don't worry because inside the map.js we
55:52 - have this wrapper inside here so we need
55:54 - to create it using const
55:56 - wrapper is equal to what do you guys
55:58 - think what do i do here guys who knows
56:00 - put on the zoom chat put on the youtubes
56:03 - guys what i do here to create the div
56:05 - that's right ralph i do what
56:08 - dot
56:10 - exactly
56:11 - okay i will save it
56:14 - and it's not there for a certain reason
56:17 - because guys
56:19 - remember guys we had this flex one when
56:21 - we defined our map so i'm going to call
56:23 - this flex dash one now
56:25 - and watch our map coming back back again
56:27 - oh
56:28 - it's back it's back okay give me one
56:30 - second
56:32 - [Music]
56:36 - okay uh turn off

56:50 - the best way to turn off italics um

56:57 - and i'll see if i can figure that out
57:00 - so guys we've got one thing
57:03 - working okay the map is done
57:06 - part one of this is done of course now
57:09 - the next i'm gonna work on is the bottom

62:40 - okay so that's fully white okay great
62:42 - we've got the uber logo the next thing
62:44 - i'm going to do is i'm going to define
62:46 - super look i'm going to give it a height
62:47 - okay
62:49 - for the height i will say h 28
62:52 - right that's going to give it a height
62:53 - so h stands for height so it's going to
62:54 - make it a little bit smaller and
62:56 - honestly that's that's pretty much it
62:58 - then what i'm going to do is on the
63:00 - profile i will create a few things right
63:02 - i'm going to create a profile container
63:05 - okay profile container and then inside
63:07 - that let's go ahead and do that i'll say
63:08 - profile
63:10 - boom
63:12 - oops
63:13 - and inside that there's two things guys
63:15 - we have the name
63:18 - the name
63:19 - uh for now it's gonna be rafae kazi for
63:21 - example
63:25 - okay and then we've got wakazi at that

63:38 - might see a difference right guys you
63:39 - see how we have start this up like this
63:41 - and then we end we have an end tag this
63:43 - is a start tag this is an end text those
63:45 - are you who are wondering okay yeah and
63:47 - then
63:48 - but inside here inside an image we don't
63:51 - actually have an end tag but the reason
63:53 - why is pay attention it's called a
63:54 - self-closing tag
63:57 - self-closing
63:59 - tag
64:00 - oh why
64:03 - is because here you see this slash at
64:05 - the bottom on the right yeah that's the
64:08 - self-closing portion okay because of
64:10 - this okay so that's why i wanna just
64:13 - want to showcase to you guys
64:15 - okay for the user image it's also gonna
64:17 - be it's a different source
64:19 - so
64:19 - um i have a different source i have a
64:22 - specific user image
64:24 - let's see if i can grab a user image
64:26 - that i like let me see here
64:28 - i got that right there copy image
64:30 - address right here you can grab any
64:32 - image guys i'm gonna i'm gonna give
64:34 - myself my own image
64:36 - sorry guys you're gonna be me

64:40 - okay
64:41 - now i'm going to create those specific
64:43 - divs guys for the profile guys who can
64:45 - tell me what do we create guys kant's
64:46 - profile what
64:48 - before write it out what is it tw dot
64:50 - what dot
64:52 - div
64:56 - okay
64:58 - then we've got of course we've got the
65:00 - name so it's going to create the name
65:01 - one
65:02 - const
65:04 - name is equal to tw dot div as well okay
65:08 - and then finally the last thing is going
65:10 - to be
65:11 - user image now for the user image what
65:13 - is it tw dot what who can guess
65:15 - fireplace can get
65:18 - the user image const
65:20 - user image is equal to what tw dot
65:24 - image yes sam that's right
65:27 - oh not you image
65:32 - all right let's go and save that let's
65:33 - look at our application here in a second
65:35 - here beautiful so we got two things guys
65:37 - we got the uber we've got the rafikaze
65:40 - and we got the image guys okay
65:42 - now
65:43 - we know that we need to have all of our
65:45 - profile stuff on the right hand side
65:47 - right you guys know that at this point
65:49 - now how do we make that work
65:51 - who can actually tell me
65:53 - if you guys can guess
65:55 - to make it work from left to right we
65:57 - use something called
65:59 - something called what not float
66:02 - relax
66:04 - that is right
66:06 - yeah that's right
66:07 - so
66:08 - i will say that on the profile section i
66:11 - will say here this i will say
66:13 - flex
66:15 - watch this
66:17 - a so don't worry that's just
66:19 - that puts the name
66:21 - left inside of this but
66:23 - to make the whole thing flex i go to the
66:25 - header
66:27 - and i say flex
66:29 - yeah
66:31 - right oh do you guys see it by the way
66:33 - yeah do you guys see as i type in flex
66:34 - yeah good you guys do okay we have flex
66:37 - on the header as well okay cool so you
66:39 - guys can see that rafikaze is right
66:41 - there
66:42 - the next thing i want to do is
66:44 - for our header
66:47 - okay i will say flex
66:49 - space and now i'm going to say um
66:53 - it's called justify between now yeah
66:56 - what this does
66:58 - what does it do kazi
67:00 - it will justify between give spaces
67:03 - exactly it it will give as much space as
67:05 - possible between all the things right
67:08 - all the things inside here yeah then
67:10 - after that for the header i'm gonna make
67:11 - align everything uh in a kind of like uh
67:15 - you know to the center so i will say
67:16 - here
67:18 - item center
67:22 - and it's kind of like centered i mean
67:23 - but not yet but you will see it centered
67:25 - in a little bit okay
67:27 - after that
67:28 - i will go ahead and close this out i
67:30 - will go back to my user image and i'm
67:31 - going to modify this image because it's
67:33 - a little bit too big for now okay
67:35 - yeah for the user image i'm going to say
67:38 - that's going to be a height of 12 and a
67:41 - width of twelves okay so that's a h of
67:42 - twelve
67:46 - beautiful
67:47 - it's gonna become a lot smaller great
67:48 - now how do we add those round corners
67:50 - kazi
67:51 - who can tell
67:53 - border radius baby let's go border
67:56 - radius
67:57 - you gotta add that in every time you
67:59 - need those rounded corners
68:01 - that's right and tail and c says it's
68:03 - called rounded full okay let me open
68:06 - that round
68:07 - thank you
68:09 - look how beautiful that is right yeah
68:11 - run it full okay so we're kind of there
68:13 - now
68:14 - next thing i want to do is center the
68:15 - rafikaze portion
68:17 - yeah so i'm going to say in the profile
68:20 - i will say flex
68:22 - items
68:23 - dash center
68:26 - you guys can see me typing right there
68:27 - yep
68:29 - beautiful and i'm going to give a margin
68:31 - right uh
68:33 - 4 on the name
68:34 - so for this name right here i'm going to
68:35 - say mr-4
68:39 - okay
68:40 - and a specific name i'm going to give it
68:42 - a width of 20.
68:46 - okay so far looking pretty good i like
68:48 - the way this is going by the way this is
68:50 - looking good now for the user image back
68:52 - to here guys and now our user image kind
68:54 - of has like a small kind of border that
68:56 - you might not see so far but has a small
68:58 - border okay to give it a border what we
69:00 - need to do is say border here
69:04 - right and i'll say border gray
69:08 - dash i'm going to say it's going to be
69:10 - 200.
69:12 - you might not see it yet why because
69:14 - it's covered by the image
69:16 - okay so to make sure it's everywhere
69:20 - we give it a padding right i'm going to
69:22 - say p dash px
69:25 - save it
69:26 - nice
69:28 - you guys see that blue border kind of
69:29 - like if i do you can see a little border
69:31 - has everywhere if i do p dash two for
69:33 - example
69:34 - three
69:36 - yeah yeah you see that right there
69:38 - that's the border right but if i do
69:39 - ps2px it's only gonna give it a small
69:41 - border nice right there beautiful so
69:45 - so far it's looking not too bad
69:47 - i'm like where this is going the only
69:49 - one they want to modify is for the name
69:52 - i'm going to give it a text of small
69:55 - just to get a small text okay it's just
69:57 - a little smaller text and that's pretty
69:59 - much it guys so we've got our uber we
70:01 - got our thing all is good there
70:04 - how do you think let me ask you this
70:05 - question how do we you see how on the
70:07 - right hand side how our profile is so
70:09 - close to the right edge
70:11 - yeah how do you think we can give a
70:13 - spacing for the right edge you guys can
70:15 - tell me
70:18 - what do we do they're saying padding
70:19 - some are saying margin
70:22 - that's right that's right now if i want
70:24 - to give space on the inside of a box
70:26 - which one we use this one you should
70:28 - definitely get
70:31 - if when i have that
70:33 - what do i do then
70:35 - who can tell me
70:40 - that's right it's gonna be padding
70:42 - guys now i'm going to give padding on
70:44 - the whole actual item this whole thing
70:47 - i'm going to give padding on because
70:48 - this whole thing kind of you know
70:50 - reflects the whole application so for
70:52 - the action items
70:54 - right actual items i will say here p
70:57 - dash four
70:59 - and that will make this a lot smaller
71:01 - like this can you maybe zoom out a
71:03 - little bit kaze because i feel like you
71:04 - zoomed in for your application so it's
71:05 - like it loose looks very okay
71:08 - yeah thank you
71:10 - there we go do you want me to take them
71:11 - out more like this much
71:13 - this is good yeah i like that okay cool
71:16 - i like that all right guys
71:18 - the top header thing is now done
71:21 - okay capiche done now
71:24 - the next thing we're going to work on is
71:27 - what
71:28 - what is the next thing we need to create
71:29 - guys who can tell me
71:32 - what's the next thing do you create
71:34 - it's going to be what
71:38 - section is a cousin huh yeah that's

86:58 - that's the next thing that we're
86:59 - actually going to be working on
87:01 - yeah
87:02 - so in nextgs to create our a different
87:05 - page you literally just create a new
87:08 - file inside your pages yeah they make it
87:11 - really simple with uh next because in
87:13 - react you have to do routing and a bunch
87:15 - of stuff
87:16 - in next all you're going to see him do
87:18 - is he's going to create a new page here
87:20 - underneath i'm going to call it search
87:22 - yes yeah and that's automatically going
87:24 - to like as soon as you click ride it'll
87:26 - automatically take you to that page so
87:27 - here's search okay and to be able to go
87:30 - to the search page that he made so
87:33 - uh yeah just add in something
87:36 - right so i'm gonna call the search i'm
87:38 - not making capital the reason why i'm
87:39 - making the class names capital because
87:41 - that's a good uh convention to go by
87:43 - cool and even if he says like something
87:45 - like hello here
87:46 - i can actually do at the end of this
87:48 - local host i can go slash search
87:52 - right and uh it actually brings me to
87:54 - that page right here so uh that's a
87:57 - really nice part about next
88:00 - yeah i like that a lot too i like that a
88:02 - lot too
88:03 - so if we know oh dang what happened here

88:22 - okay well in next year we have something
88:25 - called the link so i will go ahead and
88:26 - show this to you guys if we go up
88:29 - we have import link from next link
88:32 - that's right so in usual html you have
88:34 - like each a you know a shrek you know
88:36 - stuff like that but because we're using
88:38 - a different technology we're using links
88:40 - and where do you guys think we're going
88:42 - to put links around who can tell me
88:44 - where you're putting links around who
88:45 - can tell me what is it
88:46 - what is the thing we're putting the
88:48 - links around
88:49 - what is it
88:51 - no no not the ride well yeah i think
88:53 - i'll keep the ride but what is the
88:54 - button yeah that's right the button yes
88:56 - it is technically the right but yes
88:58 - so inside here i will say link
89:01 - shref is equal to
89:03 - dash search
89:05 - that's right that's all you have to do
89:07 - guys okay
89:09 - and then
89:10 - at end that link
89:12 - yep and this link is coming from
89:15 - uh
89:16 - hold on one second just before you start
89:18 - typing this link is yeah so again i know
89:21 - knowledge just showed you this but just
89:22 - remember this okay you're getting
89:24 - importing this link
89:27 - cool exactly so we're importing this
89:29 - link and this link says hey to which
89:31 - page are we going to we're going to the
89:33 - search page so if i go and save this
89:36 - save that so if you click on the kazi on
89:39 - the right section boom takes me to the
89:41 - home page
89:43 - right up there beautiful okay
89:46 - now in the search page a few things need
89:48 - to happen to make this work so let's
89:50 - just i think just get started on that
89:52 - one right away okay yeah
89:54 - let's go inside yes oh too source ideas

90:06 - copy from there
90:08 - paste it
90:10 - say
90:11 - done

90:15 - call the wrapper
90:18 - that's the usual thing beautiful
90:24 - there we go
90:27 - okay i'm gonna put um
90:30 - kind of practice around this because
90:31 - usually we have parentheses but because
90:34 - of is linting it kind of makes it
90:36 - cleaner so that's okay i kind of like it
90:38 - like this though
90:39 - rapper there we go beautiful

103:21 - pretty big of course don't worry we'll
103:24 - make it smaller i got you guys okay
103:27 - now the first resource i want to work on
103:30 - is the from two icons okay uh they're
103:32 - kind of like you know you can just give
103:34 - it a specific width that's the most
103:36 - important thing so
103:38 - for the front two icons let's go down
103:40 - here
103:42 - and change the way it works so i'll give
103:44 - it a width
103:46 - 10
103:47 - that should make it right away smaller
103:49 - okay
103:51 - now i'm going to give it a specific uh
103:53 - kind of like um flex
103:56 - yeah
103:57 - flex

104:07 - okay next i'm gonna do is i will go and
104:09 - do how do we center these guys who knows
104:12 - because if you guys can say i mean
104:14 - they're pretty much centered now at this
104:15 - point but
104:16 - you know not the way you wanted to
104:18 - however i do want to change
104:22 - the input container right the ipo
104:24 - container right now is the whole thing

104:33 - beautiful
104:35 - so that looks pretty good i kind of like
104:37 - where that's coming from okay now next
104:40 - thing i'm gonna do is i will go ahead
104:42 - and add the actual input uh buttons
104:45 - themselves don't worry we'll go back to
104:47 - the actual circles and squares to make
104:49 - that a little bit smaller i got you
104:51 - right inside the input container guys
104:54 - we'll create input boxes
104:57 - for people to actually use
104:59 - okay
105:01 - beautiful got the input boxes i like it
105:05 - okay
105:07 - nice

105:18 - for the you know for the whole uh when
105:20 - you when you guys type it in
105:22 - so input
105:24 - good
105:25 - and for the input guys
105:28 - i mean nothing so far but there's two
105:29 - inputs here we got one
105:32 - another one
105:34 - but
105:35 - so far it's kind of nothing okay i'll go
105:37 - to input boxes let's go ahead and create
105:39 - a simple boxes
105:41 - const input boxes
105:45 - beautiful
105:47 - is equal to tw dot dip
105:51 - shouldn't still work don't worry
105:54 - but i will go ahead and const input
105:59 - i think to that without what guys who
106:00 - can you can get me okay who can guess
106:02 - what is it
106:03 - cw dot
106:06 - what is it yeah damn that one you guys
106:08 - got it
106:09 - so gw dot input
106:14 - let's see
106:16 - okay they don't show up it's okay okay
106:19 - because you need to give them a specific
106:21 - height guys don't worry okay so now
106:23 - we don't really see them all we need to
106:25 - do is now modify the input to make sure
106:27 - it actually kind of works and it's kind
106:28 - of there right so let's go ahead and
106:30 - give it a number one in height
106:32 - so i'm going to h-10
106:35 - beautiful okay i will go ahead and give
106:38 - it a bgray
106:44 - dash 200
106:46 - huge shout out by the way to everybody
106:48 - that's still here like y'all are champs

106:53 - is confusing anthony's yeah anthony's
106:55 - going off but like seriously give
106:58 - yourselves a huge like pat on the back
107:01 - this seriously is awesome like
107:03 - because yes because it's tricky to be
107:05 - able to pay attention for this long but
107:07 - guys like this is what coding and
107:09 - development is
107:10 - yes yes it is it is so guys you guys can
107:13 - see we got the two buttons right here we
107:14 - got can you maybe you see how those two
107:16 - buttons you don't really see them but i
107:17 - will add a placeholder so if we go ahead
107:19 - and do a placeholder here
107:21 - holder is and you will see it none then
107:23 - placeholder and i want to say for
107:24 - placeholder uh your location so let's go
107:27 - ahead and set enter pickup location
107:29 - [Music]
107:31 - enter pickup location
107:35 - okay you guys can see it right there
107:36 - right right array and the next is going
107:38 - to be place folder
107:41 - is equal to
107:42 - uh where to
107:47 - boom
107:49 - okay so two buttons now now of course
107:52 - what you can see is they're kind of like
107:53 - on top of each other right so the input
107:56 - boxes one is underneath the from two
107:58 - icons right so this whole info box is
107:59 - underneath the from two icons how do we
108:01 - make sure they go from left to right who
108:03 - can tell me guys quick question huh what
108:06 - can we do
108:07 - what can we do
108:11 - what do you guys think
108:13 - yeah that's right we need to go and flex
108:15 - it okay
108:18 - so let's go ahead and go to the bottom
108:20 - go to input container and we say flex
108:25 - okay
108:26 - nice beautiful
108:29 - now it's from left to right
108:30 - okay and then at that point what i'm
108:33 - going to do is
108:34 - for the entrepreneurship and the where
108:36 - to
108:38 - input boxes how to make it go from top
108:40 - to bottom
108:42 - what do you do now
108:44 - do you guys think that's right we flex
108:46 - columns we say flex here
108:48 - and we say flex dash column
108:53 - there we go right there we go that's
108:55 - exactly what we want to do
108:57 - for the input flexes
108:59 - for the input boxes we wanted to take up
109:01 - as much space as possible so i'm going
109:02 - to give it a flex of one
109:06 - save it
109:07 - there you go so now it's taking up as
109:08 - much space as possible also the same
109:11 - time i'm going to give it a margin y so
109:12 - for every every single input right you
109:15 - see how they're stuck together let's go
109:17 - ahead and separate them so i'm going to
109:18 - say um my-two
109:20 - that gives what is it what do you guys
109:22 - think this y stands for
109:24 - what does y stand for you can tell me
109:28 - that's right overage it is the y-axis so
109:31 - basically padding on the y-axis top and
109:33 - bottom like vertical padding
109:36 - that's right vertical padding right
109:38 - m x is like the x-axis that's the
109:41 - horizontal padding okay
109:43 - that's our input beautiful the input as
109:46 - well i'm going to give it a round it
109:47 - because remember it's kind of like edgy
109:49 - right now which i don't like so i'm
109:50 - going to say here a rounded
109:54 - two
109:56 - get a specific grounding so it's kind of
109:58 - starting is it there it's kind of there
110:00 - maybe not there rounded dash two and
110:03 - then what i'll do at that point is let's
110:06 - see
110:08 - is is p dash to
110:12 - give the padding
110:13 - okay beautiful so that you can see that
110:15 - the pickup location kind of separates
110:17 - from everything and the one thing i want

112:28 - we'll fix it okay we got you so the
112:30 - first thing i'm going to do is for the
112:31 - image let's give the width and the
112:33 - height so width 10
112:35 - and h-10
112:38 - okay okay so now it's a little better
112:40 - hopefully okay
112:42 - i'm going to go ahead and give it a
112:43 - round of applause now to make it into
112:45 - like a full circle the first thing i'm
112:46 - going to do is i'm going to do a bg
112:47 - great so bg dash gray
112:50 - dash 200
112:52 - that's going you see right there that's
112:54 - the thing right so that's all good
112:56 - okay but how do i go ahead and make it
112:59 - so that it's a full-on rounded circle
113:02 - what do i do here kazi
113:04 - give it
113:06 - yeah
113:07 - border radius 50 50 but with tail it
113:11 - says
113:12 - we're using the called rounded full
113:16 - boom see right there just like that it
113:19 - is the way we want it okay
113:21 - um now you see how it's very close to
113:23 - the pickup location all the input stuff
113:25 - i will say margin left
113:28 - dash
113:29 - let's just say it's like margin left
113:31 - three maybe
113:35 - or is it margin margin is it not doing
113:37 - that no no that's that's that's the
113:38 - input sorry not on this one i don't want
113:40 - the plus icon ml string
113:45 - there we go beautiful and the one other
113:47 - thing i want to do is i want to make
113:48 - sure everything is centered vertically
113:50 - so
113:52 - who can tell me how do i center
113:54 - everything vertically make sure that
113:55 - everything even the plus icon is all
113:57 - centered vertically
113:59 - what do i do who can tell me
114:02 - it's literally like two lines of code
114:03 - guys
114:04 - what i do
114:06 - not a reverse
114:09 - not reverse item center that's right but
114:11 - on which component
114:13 - on this one
114:14 - on this one or on this one
114:17 - which component
114:18 - or maybe even a different component
114:22 - it's actually going to be on the input
114:24 - container guys so on the input container
114:26 - i will do flex that's so good but i will
114:29 - do items
114:31 - dash center
114:35 - boom you see the plus icon right away
114:38 - is right there on the bottom okay next
114:40 - i'm going to do is i will going to
114:42 - create some spacing for everything so
114:45 - for the input container guys let's go
114:47 - ahead and go back to input container
114:50 - scroll down boom boom boom let's create
114:52 - some spacing guys okay so i'm gonna say
114:55 - one
114:56 - p x dash four
114:58 - you're gonna space it from left to right
115:00 - okay so it's a little bit cleaner now
115:02 - and also for the actual uh with the from
115:05 - two icon right i'm also creating some
115:07 - spacing as well because i just kind of
115:08 - don't like the way it is so i will have
115:11 - here with the from two icon that's for
115:13 - the bottom whereas there is a wizard
115:15 - with the wizard wizard from two icons
115:17 - okay i will say margin the right is what
115:21 - maybe like two
115:23 - okay i'm liking this okay i'm liking
115:25 - this already beautiful i'm also going to
115:27 - say for the input container i will say
115:29 - margin bottom because i want to have
115:31 - space in the bottom section say margin
115:32 - bottom dish too as well
115:34 - like christmas place on the bottom too
115:37 - did it
115:38 - let's see come on did it
115:40 - no
115:44 - maybe the bottom maybe it's on the
115:46 - actual let me see here yeah input
115:48 - container
115:49 - all right here mb-2
115:52 - no
115:54 - okay nevermind okay
115:55 - so oh but yes it did it created margin
115:58 - but because remember guys margin is the
116:00 - spacing on the outside guys remember
116:02 - right margin is spacing on the outside
116:05 - okay
116:06 - okay now let's look at these
116:09 - circles they're a bit too big i don't
116:11 - like it
116:12 - so every circle gonna define give the
116:14 - height
116:15 - for the circle i'm gonna say this is a
116:16 - height of h2 2.5
116:20 - so h
116:22 - right here
116:23 - h of
116:24 - 2.5
116:27 - oops 2.5
116:28 - save
116:29 - okay don't worry about it we'll figure
116:31 - it out okay and then finally
116:34 - for the line
116:37 - a h of 10
116:40 - okay
116:43 - h-10
116:45 - don't worry
116:46 - okay and then for the square as well
116:48 - it's gonna be h of three guys okay
116:52 - the square is gonna be h of three
116:55 - each test three
116:58 - save it okay don't worry we got you okay
117:01 - so now you see how it's all stretched
117:02 - out you see on the right hand side it's
117:04 - all stretched out doesn't look good at
117:06 - all so
117:07 - make it work okay there's a really cool
117:10 - trick that i like to use because what is
117:12 - trying to do is you're trying to take up
117:13 - as much space you know in terms of like
117:16 - um horizontally
117:18 - and that's all because of flex guys okay
117:20 - flex that makes it do that so if i go to
117:23 - the input container here
117:25 - all right i'm sorry the actual from two
117:27 - icons
117:29 - okay you guys see where i'm typing right
117:31 - yeah the from two icons okay
117:34 - i will say here
117:35 - items
117:37 - the center
117:40 - boom you see that magically just fix it
117:43 - all
117:45 - magic is fixed up because item center is
117:47 - put in the center and so it prevents the
117:50 - divs from trying to stretch as much as
117:52 - possible that's the cool part about it
117:55 - okay so we got the word too we've got
117:57 - all this stuff looking pretty good i'm
117:58 - lucky this is going beautiful
118:01 - okay
118:02 - good good good
118:03 - okay
118:04 - the last thing we're going to do is i'm
118:06 - going to create the safe places so we've
118:08 - got the input container guys that's all
118:10 - good the last thing is going to be well
118:13 - the saved places
118:16 - that's pretty easy one honestly uh all
118:18 - we'll do is create a div here
118:21 - they have here called saved places so
118:23 - i'm gonna say here
118:24 - saved places here
118:27 - outside the input container so i'm say
118:28 - here saved
118:31 - places
118:32 - beautiful okay and inside here there's a
118:35 - few things we've got we've got the icon
118:38 - so let's click the star icon
118:41 - start icon and has a source is equal to
118:44 - something
118:46 - okay and there you go i'll give you guys
118:48 - the image right now in a second here so
118:49 - i'm going to copy and paste the image
118:51 - for you
118:52 - so i've got the image right here
118:56 - boom
118:57 - i'll place it for you guys in the zoom
119:01 - boom
119:03 - okay beautiful
119:05 - and then at that i'm gonna say i'm gonna
119:07 - say saved places
119:10 - for text
119:12 - beautiful then it's underneath here guys
119:14 - we're gonna create the actual style
119:16 - component of it okay let's go and do
119:17 - this const

119:57 - icon okay i want to make this icon right
119:59 - here uh to have a square so i'm going to
120:01 - give for the star

120:24 - width and a height because it's a bit
120:25 - too big guys so width that's 10 and then
120:27 - height dash 10.
120:30 - okay a little bit smaller now all good
120:32 - next i'm going to give it is a padding
120:34 - of 2 p 2 is going to be it's going to
120:37 - create some space and inside that's
120:39 - there we go exactly what i want and then
120:41 - finally i'm going to make it round how
120:43 - to make it rounded who knows at this
120:45 - point we've done it multiple times

127:50 - builds okay
127:51 - uh this was
127:53 - building uber day one
127:55 - all right who's going to be here uh i
127:57 - just show of hands who's going to be up

128:08 - nice we have an amazing community by the
128:10 - way guys if you want to join the
128:11 - community that will be working on this
128:12 - we literally had people together working
128:15 - and sharing their screen working in
128:17 - their portfolio it was pretty awesome
128:18 - inside discord i loved it it was so
128:20 - amazing guys so i highly comment guys go
128:23 - to cleverpromo.com
128:25 - discord and you'll see it there okay
128:27 - absolutely
128:28 - make you know the most important that
128:30 - you guys can do in coding is make
128:31 - networks and make connections that's
128:33 - probably like that's that's honestly
128:35 - like how you grow as a developer
128:37 - people and so forth
128:39 - yeah guys i so i know like some of you
128:41 - felt overwhelmed actually why don't you
128:43 - just say it uh raise your hands if you
128:45 - felt either overwhelmed today or just
128:47 - drop it in the chat i'd love to see it
128:49 - okay
128:51 - i know that this is i know a lot of a
128:53 - lot of me so what i want to say is what
128:55 - we've been saying from the start right
128:56 - these these coding days are going to
128:58 - feel a little overwhelming and just keep
129:00 - in mind this is pretty advanced stuff
129:01 - that we're doing okay
129:03 - so we're gonna be trying to simplify it
129:06 - for you guys um but when we're showing
129:09 - you this big build and if we're building
129:10 - uber it's gonna be a little bit complex
129:12 - but our goal with this challenge is to
129:14 - show you how coding works so let me ask
129:16 - you this at least was it enjoyable for
129:18 - you to watch has this been an enjoyable
129:20 - experience yes beautiful thank you guys
129:24 - okay very much so please thank you guys
129:27 - appreciate it
129:28 - but more i was watching the more i was
129:29 - definitely understanding peter says
129:31 - absolutely
129:32 - i liked it but a little bit fast okay it
129:35 - seems doable but i'm a newbie
129:37 - okay thank you the coding part was good
129:39 - but i followed the process to all the
129:40 - packages yep okay so
129:43 - that's the idea right it's this is going
129:46 - to be a lot that we're going to be doing
129:48 - for you know from complete step by step
129:51 - and all of that stuff if you guys want
129:52 - to ever learn it of course we have
129:54 - videos on youtube okay and just look out
129:57 - for day five because we got something
129:59 - special for you guys where we will give
130:01 - you something that's going to be really
130:02 - really awesome for you okay so just be
130:04 - on the lookout for that outside of that
130:06 - if you want to pick up the basic basic
130:08 - beginner stuff
130:10 - our youtube is filled with that okay
130:12 - html css javascript all those types of
130:14 - tutorials are up there with that said i
130:17 - think the homework for you guys is clear
130:19 - does everybody understand the homework
130:20 - give me a thumbs up or something if you
130:22 - understand the homework
130:24 - okay cool nice i like it making that
130:27 - black button that's it all right
130:30 - cool um
130:32 - and yeah with that said watch this video
130:34 - again tonight for a lot of you who
130:35 - weren't able to code along at the same
130:38 - time watch this video tonight and team
130:40 - up with somebody in the discord channel
130:42 - from this community and build this part
130:44 - of the app okay yes if you guys were
130:47 - overwhelmed like i said just rewatch the
130:49 - video
130:50 - pause it pause it you know because there
130:52 - is something special about you taking
130:54 - your time to watch this right no matter
130:56 - what kind of a teacher you have or you
130:58 - know however time a teacher spends with
131:00 - you there's something special about
131:02 - literally just sitting down in your
131:03 - computer
131:04 - going through a video pause a little by
131:07 - little doing it with yourself you know
131:09 - you're going to learn you're going to
131:10 - learn a ton a ton more right that's
131:12 - right so you learn a lot today with us
131:14 - as you watched it okay this is like the
131:16 - presentation for you guys right you guys
131:18 - enjoyed the energy right you saw the
131:20 - issues the errors we had now
131:22 - take it implement it put into your code
131:25 - and tomorrow i want to see the homework
131:28 - done yes i want the homework done
131:30 - absolutely we want to see your links
131:32 - we'll link you to the airtable so put
131:33 - your links in there guys i know you're
131:35 - asking us for the source code but
131:37 - there's gonna be some people that have
131:38 - done it and they can share it with you
131:40 - okay so this is we wanna do it this way
131:43 - so you're like forced to talk to other
131:45 - people and make friendships and not just
131:47 - look at our code download it and use it
131:48 - okay so do that okay and i think you're
131:51 - gonna find a lot of friends and you'll
131:53 - be able to use their source code i'm
131:54 - sure they'll share it with you okay yeah
131:56 - i mean i can show the social we should
131:58 - just share it through github i can
131:59 - potentially share it what do you think
132:00 - sure we can even share it with you guys
132:02 - through github and then we can link it
132:03 - to you guys and you'll see either in
132:05 - your email or in the discord
132:07 - yeah i'll show you i'll upload my our
132:09 - source code to github and then we'll
132:11 - send you guys the link so you guys can
132:13 - see it okay awesome guys with that said

Cleaned transcript:

youtubes are going yo what is up guys how's it going this is qazi welcome to the uber build you're going to be building uber from scratch okay and it's going to be an absolutely incredible build today i got with me you got nas now dumaski and guys we're building a sick app today we're going to use technologies like next year yes react gs we're going to use stealing css style components and even tear this out we're going to create a map using map box that's right it's gonna be a lot of fun guys this is gonna be absolutely incredible there's gonna be a ton of stuff that's gonna be covered in this so please keep up i hope you're gonna enjoy this and have fun okay uh and we'll go through this kind of quickly okay so it's gonna be an uber build it's gonna be jacked it's gonna be awesome tailwind firebase react next stack is i mean this is stacked right yes so stacked upon stacks upon stacks that's right tons of stacks here so now we're ready to build uber clone this is day two of the challenge so this uber build will be built in three days we're gonna build it slowly so everybody can keep up with us and make progress that's our goal um all right and these are the things that you guys are going to be using all right let's go here who's ready to build it guys drop it down below in the youtube chat in the zoom chat because we already let's go yo frank ramos just started off with the five dollar donation thank you so much paul just dropped the four dollar donation thank you so much uh tag us on instagram at cleverkazy and for nas tag him at nas domonsky okay uh put put your stories of you coding we will repost you we love that stuff okay cool the chat is blowing up everywhere i'm excited let's keep rocking and rolling okay so day one of youtube guys we got ton of views on youtube we had 670 people watching us live and we had over 130 plus homework submissions so thank you guys so much for that we're going to be getting to the uber build in just a second so that's for everybody that's tuning in right now i'm going to be getting to uber right away yeah okay some submissions were absolutely awesome so thank you guys for that um so here we have macy so on the left hand side and ben carter you all built your portfolios and even deployed it online so shout out to all of you that looks so good that made that ben carter one is so good it looks exactly like via's code like that is top level like knowledge like very creative i love that nice job then that's a really nice one and good job macy as well awesome job putting it together that's awesome devlin roca built their portfolio nice job looks very clean i like it and then juan you took our portfolio and changed your photo and stuff like that it's a good job and you guys even have the links there which means it's deployed so nice work oh wow leonardo we got leonardo up in here looks like he likes to solve problems and jose he is currently working as a lead backing developer what that's crazy well now you're also going to be a front developer so that's sick that's beautiful jay and mario drop your portfolios great job and uh guys don't feel bad if you didn't show your portfolio we still love you okay we're here for you we love you now oh nice now what's the agenda for today uh the agenda guys is this right day two to four we're going to be building the uber clone with uh with next js react.js tailwind css and firebase okay that's what's going to be happening today and for the next two days after this and day five we're going to be going over your roadmap to becoming a frontend developer in under 90 days and we're going to be revealing something very special on that last day so stay tuned yes and all those days are 5 00 pm ps you guys should just remember that okay make sure you come to every single day every single day is value packed jampacked energy packed yes 5 p.m pst remember that okay here's where we're going to be building today all right so we're going to be building uber and you guys are going to be building these screens all right so that's a login screen with full user authentication once you log in you get to view the entire app and you can choose whether you're going to do ride or what you want to do okay once you do that it asks you it takes you to the search hey where do you want to go so you can put in your cities like santa monica or los angeles or whatever it may be and then check this out right on the last screen it will tell you um not only which rides are available but it'll tell you exactly how much the cost too based on the distance yeah so like if you want to go from santa monica all the way to europe it's going to cost you a pretty hefty amount right so it will actually calculate that for you yes but anyways today guys we're going to be building two pages so we're going to build the home page you can see right there and the search page so the two pages that we're focused on is start those two pages okay and then the next two days after that then we'll be focusing on the other ones okay but these are gonna be our focuses for today beautiful beautiful okay that's the main goal for today okay is that clear to all of you guys what we're covering today capisce okay beautiful beautiful awesome all right uh now stick to the end right of day five we have something special coming for you so just like i said make sure you keep that in mind and let's get started with today's training if you have any questions comment them below and we'll be able to answer them at some point wow uh fha just dropped the donation for 25 and just said current student in fsm that's awesome thank you so much that's one of our students in full stack mastery boot camp and it seems like 5 p.m is a perfect time and they can actually jump on are you guys liking these times better like 5 pm pc instead of 10 mpc let us know down in the comments below we would love to see it okay and one last thing guys i want to say guys let's go ahead and smash that like button okay if you guys love us we love you so we'll appreciate some love and that i know will make you smile so smash that like button at the same time of course subscribe because we're gonna do this a lot uh of course and that's pretty much it and of course take this out as many people as possible because this is some amazing amazing value and at the same time we just have a lot of fun so we like to spread our knowledge to the whole world and our energy absolutely all right with that said guys here's time for some freaking homework okay here's what we're gonna do we're gonna give you guys homework at the end of this okay so that so stay tuned for the homework what we're gonna give you and the homework is gonna be basically what we don't get to build during this build okay and we'll let you know exactly okay cool uh with that said i think we're pretty much ready to let's get started to pretty much get into it okay so let's go ahead and close this out yeah and i'm gonna give you guys just a little bit of context guys just so you know for those of you who are you know following along you know i always say this if you cannot keep up it is completely okay right the point of this for you guys to see what we can do what you can do as a coder there might be a lot of new things for you right and that's just the whole point of it right is the it's like to see give you some seeds and what's possible yeah okay and then you can add later on rewatch this video so that you can go ahead and you know take it step by step all right absolutely so don't yell at us if you just kink up keep up with it you know we're not gonna take up five hours you wanna take up only a few hours okay and this is the this is the app guys so i'm showing you guys the app here's the map right you can see what's going on you can click ride and then in this app you can type in like which cities you want to go to so here we can do something like this right and then i can go los angeles here and i can hit confirm locations and boom it actually shows me my route from los angeles to santa monica right and here are my options when i click them you can see things change and it also gives me pricing yeah and that's pretty much it you can then after that you can go back go back to the screen if you want you can hit the back button right there the top left hit back again that takes it back to the home screen and if you even hit the profile page the profile picture it will actually take you out and we'll send you out yes exactly beautiful so guys give us some fire down below in the chat if you are excited to build this because i think this looks pretty cool wouldn't you say so cozzy this looks pretty freaking awesome um i'm really excited for for you guys to watch um watch this get built out um okay amazing so i think let's go ahead and get started so now what are the first steps guys all right what do you guys think drop it down the chat in the chat well open up the terminal so for you guys open up your command line or terminal okay that's the first thing that we're actually going to go ahead and do here and what i'm going to do is i'm going to go into a folder so i just like to go into a folder called github that i have okay you don't need to go into any folders you can stay exactly where you're at okay yes and then what we want to do here is we want to type in a command all right and this command is a simple command that allows you to install this next project yeah let's install this project okay so so what you guys want to do is do npx it's called it is called npx create next app that's right npi create dash next app and then you do at latest yep so we're gonna do just like this cool now to how to be able to make this work you have to have npm installed and as we said yesterday you have to have npm installed so hopefully you guys got that installed yeah or notes installed sorry and you can try it and if you don't have it installed you can install it of course later on as well okay even after this video like if you at any point you just can't keep up and you're trying your hardest and you're like just getting frustrated you can just watch okay i would say keep trying to code along with us and if you just can't some point you can just watch all right and make sure you're kind of getting it that's the whole that's the whole idea okay cool and what's your project name i'm just gonna call it uber next clone okay just like that and i'm going to hit enter and now you see it's saying installing react react dom and next nice this is looking good yes on eslint so your sled is going to be for cleaning up your code yes uh if you guys have trouble with like hey what is um you if you said cd github and it didn't work that's okay that that command only works for me because i have a folder called github if you don't have that folder you don't even need to type in cd github you can just type in that npx command that we showed you beautiful next thing we want to do is we want to open up vs code and open open up our project cool so now i'm gonna go ahead and we're gonna i'm gonna open it up in my uh via cs beautiful okay if you want the the command let me go and get you the command npx create next app right here i got you boom okay so i just basically went into my vs code and i picked that folder all right so if i were to show you guys how you would do this is you would go to whichever folder you put it in here i'm going to click uber next clone and then i'm just going to hit open in my vs code and it's going to open that up right here okay beautiful and uh i'm gonna make nas and me a little bit smaller because i think we're taking up over like too much of the screen it's gonna stop you guys seeing some of the coding action that's happening so that's gonna be mad yeah okay awesome so i think uh that's good and now i'm gonna give access to nas so he can jump in this as well and start coding beautiful just put in slack from me all right here you go thank you i'm gonna open this up in a little in a second here one second okay um all right cool so we're gonna start now coding this see you cause it do you can do it again uh it's not opening the actual thing okay here let's uh try this again there you go okay now i see it hold on awesome hey it's just taking a little time okay all right it says you have joined and it says you left so hopefully you're in i hope so too okay beautiful wow guys we're up to 303 people this is fire thank you guys so much for tuning in we're gonna be building uber all right from scratch and you guys are going to watch us build it and watch us add in all this functionality so i'm excited for you guys i hope you guys are excited whoever is just tuning in now uh welcome welcome and like we said you know even in the zoom chat if there's something you're feeling like freaking out it's all good just watch along and you're gonna start getting it and picking it up uh cool somebody's like yeah the terminal is taking a long time to upload yeah that'll happen sometimes uh is this not working for you bro i got it i got it it's just taking some time okay thank god whoo are you in yeah yeah yeah i should see okay because it to me just says zero participants give me one second uh joined hey let's go and can you okay great so we've got that guys right we've got our application we've got two things we've got of course in the top left if you want to look at it if we don't do a shared server just yet let's not do that just yet let's go back to our file structure okay and you can see there's two there's a few things we've got we've got the pages folder we've got the public folder right there and we also got even uh what we've got the styles folder that's right the one that we're going to be working with right now is going to be the pages folder so if you go to the pages folder right there yeah and if you simply open up index.js so i feel like a bunch of people are asking what was the first step so let me just show it because i think bunch of people are getting stuck there so uh a lot of you guys are saying what was the first step so the first step was this we typed in literally the first thing you need to do right is i'm just going to go here and clear this up so it's clear the first thing that you're going to do is this npx create next app at latest just like that and that's going to install everything for you if this gives you errors this just means you don't have node installed the right way and make sure you have it installed the right way and then everything will work yes okay awesome um and then you essentially open that folder so this will create an app for you then you create then you open up that folder in visual studio code all right okay all right let's keep going nas beautiful okay after that we want to do is we want to open up the terminal here so you can do open terminal all right here we go there we go and you can do npm space fun space dev all right there we go beautiful so looks like you've got we've got us a and now you want to open this one up okay here we go there we go open up let me zoom out all right so this is if you are able to get to this point you have your very first uh react slash next app up and running okay so congratulations if you've made it or if you haven't made it it's okay you can rewatch it and make it up to here yes yes yes yes so at this point guys this is your first application right it's the starter application but of course we're going to modify this now okay so if we go into our pages folder and if we go in to our index.js yeah we can do that right now okay so let's go into pages folder and let's go into index beautiful okay and you can see that there's all of these things we've got the head we've got the main and this is literally like html except just to give you guys some context in next gs react.js it's actually called jsx which is basically html but for javascript okay so just has a different name okay yeah now we're going to do first is we need to remove all of this in terms of remove everything from head where you see the head and i'm going to go all the way down i'm going to remove all the way down to the footer right here so we don't need all any of this stuff right here okay this is what your file should look like after you're done exactly exactly then you want to go ahead and click save right and at this point your application should look like nothing i'm going to go i'm going to go ahead and open up my localhost so i can see what i'm seeing from your site beautiful and inside here which you can just say stuff like for example you know i can say the header right and if you run this if you save this it should technically show the header for you right there okay yeah so now if you look at our application right now let's go back to our application okay uh the prebuilt one the right the one that's already been built let's go ahead and sign in with google kazi all right and what do we see go sign up with google now when i see applications guys i see what i see boxes literally in life your life is made of small boxes in terms of coding wise okay so if you see a box here what are some boxes do you see right here guys okay let's think about this well we've got one box that's the map okay and then we got another box that's going to be the bottom section right that's going to be the that's going to contain your buttons going to contain your header everything right so the reason why i do that and this is very very important is because this allows me to build html structure remember how we said that html is like a bonus right well i'm literally looking and how the bones are built right just by looking at it like that okay so if we have the map you can see i'm gonna go and create create this div called map div right here and inside here i'm gonna say map right that's gonna be my fault my first thing yeah and that i'm going to say here div right here and i'm going to say i'm going to call this the let's just say the start section okay boom so you can see if we go back to our application we have two things map and start yep all right beautiful and there are two like little boxes yeah they're just two little boxes and i'll show you exactly why they're how they are little boxes if i go back to my uh css actually it's uh inside the home the mod of the css you could click on that one maybe maybe you can follow my code can you click follow me somehow or no yeah i can i'm following you yeah is it good yeah yeah okay beautiful all right so if i go back i'm going to go back minus the js i'm going to give this a class name yeah for now and because i just want to show you exactly what we're looking for right i'm going to call it styles dot let's just call it a map yeah and inside this day i'm gonna say class name is equal to right here styles dot start okay right there's and we we give this like class name because remember in order for us to style something we need to have a class name okay yeah i go back to my home damage that's my module.css and i will actually create those so like i said we created the map one boom and then we're gonna create the start one right like so okay i will go ahead and create a background color here and i'm gonna call it a red yeah right right you guys can see right away right we've got the red color if i go to start i'm going to give this a background color of what green oop not green green no beautiful right so now we've got those two things right now let's think about okay how do we now make sure that all this you see remember how we built these two boxes one top and one bottom right so how do we make it in a way where they fill up the whole screen that's an interesting portion right well this is where we have a height for example if i go to my container here and i say height i can say 100 vh okay and check this out this is called 100 vertical height pay attention i'm going to give the background color let's just say uh background background color oh let's just say blue for now so you guys can see exactly what i'm talking about oops blue beautiful there we go you guys can see so without this height of 100 vh basically nothing will happen and it will just be like this yeah you see but if i say a height of 100 vh now is the full height yeah yeah okay now how do we make sure that this all these now take up the same amount of screen real estate this is where we you use something called display flex and you can know this down somewhere you know somewhere in your notepad but flexbox is a very important tool you're going to use just in general as a developer right it's what is what allows us to create like structures you know like facebook for example uses flexbox netflix uses flexbox everybody uses flexbox to be able to structure things yeah so if i could display flex here boom beautiful after that okay don't worry don't worry don't worry both faces in a second here we'll say flex direction you change direction to b column right here column and now it's column flex direction and now what i'm going to do is because of this i'm going to give my map a flat and i'm explaining this a second here flags of one boom right you see will take up a lot of space and then i say start also guys flags of one boom so what just happened here right remember basically what we did is we gave our map so our map right here we give this you know when i say flex of one it means basically the weight the importance of that div that container and then our start also has the same weight or the importance so if they both have the same you know the same amount of weight that means they will what they'll be split 50 50. correct yes or no yeah 50 50. yeah right if i give the start of 0.5 check this out what do you think will be smaller right if i say 0.5 what do you think yeah the star one let me ask you this what if i say this is flex 0.5 then which one will be smaller here's my question to you dropped in the chat i'm really curious which will be smaller if i put flex 0.5 for the map which one hey that's a good that's a good one guys exactly it will be the same so if i flick 0.5 i'm saying they are the same importance got it so guys this is what we created on this point right it's all good and dandy that's exactly what we want but of course it's not application the next thing i'm gonna do guys is the following i'm gonna go back to instags and what i want to understand is yes this is not the uber clown at this point but because i don't want to go further using css at this point we're done using css we're going to be using now styled components what i just showed you just one way to create styles which is an amazing way but now what i'm going to show you is how do we create style components use style components to create amazing css ready for this ready quasi yeah let's do it beautiful all right so the first thing we're going to create is we need to install tailwind css okay can you or can you go to google please and type in uh tailwind css or tailway style components there we go yep so if you type in tailwind uh tailwind style components right is that what you said that's right tailwind styled components here we go cool yes let's click the first one that's what i'll do that's we're going to use then you guys want to go ahead and scroll all the way down go all the way down and there's the install not all the way down sorry that's two that's too much let's go a little bit up now this is the one right yeah now scroll up a little bit more scroll up uhhuh up stop stop stop stop stop right here scroll a little bit down and there you will see so if you scroll yeah they go beautiful if you scroll and then you see how this is the code you want to run but we're not going to run this just yet because we need to install tail and css separately so there's a button there tail and css you see that button it says install tail and css in the little font that's italic it's like italic font on the bottom on the bottom uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah let's see there we go cool so i'll click that beautiful and then you guys can just even probably type in install tailwind css into google and come to the same page yeah click next yes at this point cool and there you go this is what we need to type in so the first thing you type in is gonna be the npm install which is this npm install dash g section you see that quasi got it so uh wait hold on hold on npm and saw dash g yeah right there or dash oh whatever this says right there oh and dash d sorry npm is still there this is the one right that's the one again yes okay okay got it all right cool so we're going to copy this one yeah all right let's go ahead and then this is the one that we're going to install with that's the first one yes cool so here we go let's hit so just copy paste that into your command line in this folder hit enter and that's going to start the installation process for that okay uh i guess for future if you guys want to build your app you should probably just do this this will make it easy to install uh taylormade by default yeah yeah that might be pretty good yeah okay cool and then what's next this one over here exactly then you want to do it exactly you want to do that one next okay cool so let's paste that one that's going to be the next thing that we want to install all right so now it's created a css config file beautiful and you can actually see on the left hand side there's a css config file that's been created for you yep right here that's right and then if you scroll all the way if you scroll more down now in the actual browser so go the browser back to the browser now scroll down you see where it says configure tail want to remove unused styles and production yeah there we go and that purge you see that purge the plus for the purge yeah i'm gonna copy that section and just paste it over that exactly paste it over that purge in the tail without configuring yes so before purge was empty you guys and now we just added these things inside of it yes cool good awesome good beautiful so we've got that okay and then at that point we're pretty pretty much done the one last thing i want you to do is you see how it says scroll down a little bit and it says import till and directly in your gs yep so take this guys and this is the page we want to import it in so go to pages slash so underscore app.js all right all right here and inside here you want to import that exactly yep perfect so i'm going to go here and i'm just going to paste it so that's good beautiful all right and is this it or do i need to do any of this stuff here not yet so that's pretty much that's almost done we've got one last step guys okay let's go back to our initial npm where we fought where we found style components gives you if you hit the back button kazi oh there we go beautiful and then now you want to install the npm i the whole npm i one there we go okay cool so let's go ahead and do that let's copy paste so tailwind has a multiple steps guys to get it to work let's uh to install it so we installed tailwind and now we're going to do tailwind with style components exactly exactly so just to be clear guys so those who don't know raise your hand or raise your hand or just drop in the chat if you don't know what tailwind is like who does not know what tailwind is you probably don't know probably a lot of people don't know so tailwind is like a it's like a css library that basically like combines a few css styles because css is like the core right that's like the core that's like the core that makes everything work yeah um tailwind then is uses those core that core library to go ahead and give you some functionality to make it easier for you to style things it's kind of like bootstrap a little bit yeah i don't think if you heard it before yeah yeah it just makes it easier for you to write your css okay exactly exactly exactly so you installed that that seems to be a little good and now at this point we're pretty much done if you scroll if you keep scrolling to the bottom in that uh on that page it will tell you how do you use this it says import tw uhhuh so copy that yeah and let's use it inside our index.js instead our index.js import that there cool beautiful and guys that's it so now here's the cool part let's go ahead and check out how we go ahead and use now tailwind all right now if you follow me along here instead of using divs now we're gonna use style components so it's kind of like we're creating our own div names yeah watch it right i'm going to say the following i'm going to say a wrapper okay and i'm going to close this out with the wrapper boom of course it's going to break not enough is going to work don't worry now i'm going to create that style component i'm going to say const wrapper is equal to tw dot div we're using the tw that's from here the top right and we're creating the div here and we're using backticks so what these chords called are these are called backticks so they're not quotes be careful with that because a lot of you guys will probably miss miss it right they're back they're like on the left section of your keyboard yeah all right i'm gonna save this now and you can see it's it's kind of working right now right it's kind of there right yeah and it's not even broken that's the cool part also instead of me using this div class name styles map i'm going to say map oop map and i'm going to close that with a map as well boom yeah right instead of doing that start i'm going to say for example i'm going to call this a different name i'm going to say here it's called a action button so i'm going to just call it a little bit differently which is completely okay right they're going to be called action let me see one second it's going to be called action items actually actually items sorry action items action items beautiful and we'll close it up with action items as well of course it's not there yet so we need to go ahead and const action items equals to tw that div so every time you create a div like you know like action items or whatever basically you have to create e specify it using tw.div right yeah now it might be asking question okay i'm going to save this construction map can you go ahead and uh handle runtime error can you refresh it uh yeah sure refresh okay server error requires new the chrysler constructor map requires new oh that's why we have it we didn't do the map on guys const map as well map is equal to tw that div there we go that's why yep cool beautiful nice let's go beautiful let's go the app is done hey guys thank you so much for watching we'll see you guys in the next one all right so you guys can see that we've done we've done basically what we had in the css so now remember how we had the rcss i used to follow me yeah you are beautiful yeah remember how we had our css it looked a little bit like this where i'm going to transfer this to using tail and css components so watch this now remember how we had inside the module inside our container we had display flex flash direction column background color blue let's transfer that to here i'm going to go to the wrapper that's our main uh div wrapper i will say flex number one that's gonna give me flex items okay then i say here flex dash column okay which is gonna be columns and then check this out i go the map i'm gonna say bg dash red dash 500 is it not saving let's see let's refresh save looks like it's saved well where is the color though rapper map gw dot do yeah you got the wrapper yeah that's that's right yeah like this column do we import all of our styles that should be good you're not using styles anywhere though i can remove that one actually let me go see here that's interesting why is it not specifically what if i do bg red bg dash rad dash 300 uh dash you know 300 i don't know anything nothing that's so interesting guys restart the maybe we could try that okay try stopping it and starting it again npm run dev uh let's give it a try so restart hey let's go everybody give it up for david let's go david yeah let's go guys if you have issues like that just go ahead and restart the app quit it out of it and how do you query you said like control c right or control x to quit out of it right uh yeah ctrl c and then just start the run the command again npm run dev that's right and all that is on the terminal guys if you're wondering okay yeah so here's what we did we created the flex we made this wrapper flex we give it a bj red 300 right or let's just uh bg 300 i'm going to you know how we did the whole height screen i'm gonna say h dash screen which represents the height of a 100 vh okay there we go beautiful right and then after that right that's pretty much all we have to do let's look at our map now and with our map we want to give it a flex of one like so which will have them take up as much space as possible and the same is going to happen with the action items right i'm going to give it a flex of dash one now we have map and start so it's exactly the same thing guys as we did the last time capisce capisce beautiful ever understand that so like i said we have flex of one which basically specifies that it's the same weight as the other one guys okay all right so we've got those two things beautiful the next thing guys we're going to work on quasi is what ha you said the next thing all right i think i don't know bro i think either the you want to work on the map or you want to work on yeah do the map let's do the map cool let's do it okay map is also going to be kind of very careful because you have there's a few things you need to install as well sure okay let's go can we show them the map at first uh yep so this is the map that we're gonna be working on right now guys yes beautiful okay let's work on that map now this map guys just to be clear it's usually called map box right so it's a it's a really cool tool that just allows you to import maps and use maps in your application so the first thing you guys want to do is open up your browser and go to mapbox.com cool got it there we go mac box mapbox.com that box okay you want to create an account sign up ooh okay yeah it's okay it'll be quick just do it really fast you'll be fine all right i'm gonna be creating my account guys let's do it you guys should be creating your account too yeah hey that's nice hey um okay your account really quickly here let's do it all right my account is being created now okay it will send you a link and i'll send you a confirmation link to your email so if you just open up your email really quickly there's an unexpected error apparently for what i don't know okay awesome so that's good yep it did send me an email so now i'll go to my email guys hit the like button guys much appreciated how many likes we're at i think we're about 300 400 likes i'm not sure let's go up to 500 guys you want to get up to a thousand likes this one you guys got this all right here we go beautiful um confirming my account okay awesome confirmation of my account is now done so here we go this is this is what we have yes so this is your your account for mapbox okay again it's free no matter where you are you should be able to create an account you don't have to pay for anything you have to enter billing nothing none of that okay yep daniel daniel no you do not have to follow along my friend okay beautiful so if you scroll down uhhuh scroll down you'll see there's a few things there's a token portion and so forth but that's not we're looking for let's go all the way up cool okay and actually can make it a little bit bigger yeah the full screen cool where is your scroll all the way up is that as much up as you possibly can yes create them where's your dashboard i'll click dashboard okay let's see uh that's that's what i have okay click on integrate map box there we go okay type in uh web js this one yep cool beautiful use npm okay beautiful and then copy this npm install map box so copy this one yeah nice copy this and put it into the terminal guys okay so let's go back to our reviews code nice and put on turned on and hit enter there we go it's installing it that looks good nice all right installation is done okay so you've got that working that's beautiful the next thing to do so you want to then you see how it says you need to link your style she says you see how it says link shrek you see that where uh on the on the right include the gljs css file you see that uhhuh copy this no we don't want to copy this we want to do it a little bit differently here because we're using next yes so i gave you the specific code kazi in slack it's called import mapbox gl okay so you want to go ahead and copy that you want to go back to your um app.js guys app.js and then under here then you want to import uh mapbox gl got it okay okay you got it beautiful at that point we're pretty much done pretty much done do we also import this too no no that's gonna be later okay cool yes stop that now hit next on the right section like where you see next in map box okay yes okay now we've got a few things okay you see this bomb mattebox glue because required we don't need that this is where now we import mapbox so let's go back to index.js okay let's go okay and there we're going to import mapbox i'm gonna do this right now okay so give me one second here i'm gonna do this right now for you okay so it's literally just called macbook gl like so like boom so right here okay boom so map gl from mapbox gl okay that's gonna be our macbook gl next i'm gonna do is we're gonna create our uh token so in the specific token and i have a token here but on the right hand side it will show your token as you guys can see in your uh okay it says i don't turn my string constant let's see let's see let's see it's okay you can just do it like this because i forgot to put a beautiful okay okay one second let me go and copy the token properly because i didn't copy it well okay do you want me to use my token or no no i got it okay beautiful all right different token here okay so the token you see on the right side you see how you have you guys have a token on the right hand side um yeah that's the one you want to copy so you want to do matte box gl access token copy that whole thing and paste it exactly where i just showed you yeah right here just like this yes okay done well cost says done wait what cause that's not no no no no no [Laughter] uh my my brother's name is wakas that's why there you go beautiful so we've got our token guys the reason why we have a token is because this allows madbox to know that hey you know what you are a real person okay yeah now for that after that what we want to do is we want to now create uh our map box now it's a little bit different now as you can see that you see how it says um new map shell that map all that stuff that's not gonna create so inside here yeah we're gonna do like this we're gonna say const map equals new map box stop map like this right here okay don't worry about this so far now this is gonna work we don't want this right now okay okay beautiful now you basically can copy everything that you have on the right hand side near that specific uh what's it called map yeah if you can copy this that's completely fine okay so you can don't worry about it let me see yeah beautiful um next thing we want to do guys is this is a map but it's not really going to work initially because we need to use a different type of style to to make this work now what i mean by that you see we initialize the map this initializes our whole map okay yeah but in our application in next gslash reactor yes in order to initiate something to start the application we use something called use effect that's right so i'm going to import something called use effect import use effect from react you guys can see it right here in the on the on the top okay let's save this right here this is what we got okay and then at that point we're gonna use use effect so use effect boom okay the next thing we're gonna do we're gonna do we're gonna create a function like this and i'm gonna specify that it's a something that's gonna load in the beginning of replication so just to give you guys some context use effect is something that's gonna be uh conglold and whenever your application loads for the first time so if i do console.log yeah log and i say hello all right and i save it okay can you maybe go to the application qazi yeah let's go to the application boom yeah and if you rightclick inspect element can you try that yeah there we go okay let's go console beautiful and yeah i see hello right there yeah you can see guys that's hello right and that's only ran the first time that your application gets loaded and that's what we need to do with the map right now i'm going to send you a link here really quickly here okay so i'm going to say map box here essentially link really quickly macbooks using um right here so i'll send you guys this link really quickly you guys can go check this out i'll give you this in slack okay this will give you guys some context on how to use mapbox and react can you go go ahead and open that one up sure all right there we go beautiful i know it's like imitation guys but this is just something you have to learn when you you know get into this okay now let's scroll down scroll down scroll down scroll down scroll down and you will see something called source app.js how do you add mapbox gl to yes right there at the bottom just scroll down okay scrolling there we go keep scrolling yeah and there you have user so skip scroll a little bit more uhhuh there we go and now we get the user fact you everybody see that it actually tells you exactly how to do that right there you see no uh right there use effect okay right there yep got it beautiful yes so that's what we want to do but we're going to do a little bit differently right so we can copy this it's going to copy this quasi uhhuh copied it okay and then go back to our piece of code yeah beautiful and replace it with a used effect with the user effect that we currently have okay beautiful hey beautiful and i'm gonna work with this now okay so we don't need this map.current no don't need none of that okay and so i'm just going to say const map here const map that's going to create our map here this right here container is basically it's going to look for hey where am i going to put my map right what id now to to enter that i if i you look at me i have this map section right here i'm going to give it an id is equal to map yeah right here i can remove this map section right here now this map basically is going to say hey you know what this is where you put your actual map box so instead of doing map continue the current i'm going to say map okay the styles that's completely fine okay for latitude longitude i have a specific lab to launch it's like the center of the united states i can copy and paste this for you guys maybe you guys can copy pixels for you as well it's like 99 right here 39 you guys can copy and paste it for you if you guys on youtube or if you're on on zoom i can even do it for you right now as well so you can all have it all right so let's go ahead and do that right now boom all right then the zoom what do you guys think this zoom does okay what do you think this represents you guys tell them in the chat but you guys think this represents who can tell me what do you think this represents the zoom portion but tell me what is represent that's right it's just a zoom tool but it's basically the zoom number so i'm going to remove this zoom number boom and i'll just give it a three yep you guys are yes there we go that's beautiful i know right so go ahead and close out your uh console console log your inspect element please yeah beautiful by the way i see you guys guessing it correctly in there in the chat you guys were saying you guys know what the zoom is so nice job on that yeah good job everybody so look everything is good all right so this is our first section but of course you guys can see that maybe this map looks a little bit different than we usually look uh what we first showed you it's because there's a different style you see this right here this this style we want to have by the way this is the style that we want so i have a different style right here i'm going to copy this for you and paste it in for you right here well it's a different style i'll paste it in for you and zoom guys if you want to check it out yeah this is the style here we'll paste it in zoom and a monother somebody if you guys can paste it on youtube as well so if somebody needs it they can have it exactly so now you guys can see that the map looks very different yeah yeah that's that yeah it looks very very very different so the map guys is done it is done we can remove all this section we don't need any of this right here right we can save this and our map is pretty good now i'm going to do this now a little bit differently guys now one of the coolest things about nextgs that you can do is the fact that you guys can create something called components and who can who can tell me what are components what do you guys think who can tell me what are components if you guys are in zoom what are components what are components huh components what can tell me it's a piece of code that's right reusable ui element a part on your app parts of a whole yeah that's a good way to think about it beautiful it's a reusable ui element right so it's like almost like you use the same kind of little structure block to be able to use in multiple places so for the map because we're gonna be using multiple places guys i'm going to create a component for this right away so if we go back to pages if you go to the pages section you click right new for a click and you click new file uh and and okay our new folder in your folder and create that called the components okay we're going to put that inside of pages right metal pages you guys can see already created right here well okay okay you created it while i was creating it so i'm going to delete mine cool there we go okay so then i'm going to create inside here i'm going to create a new file right click a new file and i'll say map dot js guys boom that's our map now okay that's gonna be our component there's nothing in here so to really quickly create a component i'm gonna say r a f c e and this is a really cool um kind of you know a handy dandy tool what is the tool called uh cozy do you know uh it's like extensions so it's uh if you go into uh if you wanna install this extension it's like is co is uh react.js code s7 it's like yeah snippets and stuff like that so it's this one right here es7 react redux snippets and then you can do rafce and then essentially just makes a component for you right off the bat exactly beautiful so within this at this point we're gonna i'm going to go back to my index.js and i will import a lot of stuff that i need of course i'm going to import my tailwind and my my map box as well we'll copy all of that i will go back to mata.js i will use it i will also import import use effect that's we're going to use inside here you could just do it over here i think huh you could do it up here but that's fine yeah i can just i don't need the react portion at all honestly right so got that and then i'm pretty much going to do the same thing i did before because remember i'm going to create this div called wrapper right wrapper i'm going to give an id is equal to math they're like looks like uh david rokosi had a hand in that styling yes yes he did what's up david let's go dude he had a lot of hand in building this app actually behind the scenes oh yeah oh yeah he did it everybody yeah let's go all right okay the developer in the shadows true that through that i will go ahead and import this map.gl access token so go ahead and copy all of that or or actually cut it go back to my gs we're going to use it now here okay okay right again we're just making it a little bit more diverse another is a little bit more kind of componentized i like to call it right after that i will copy this user effect because i don't need this insight here i will command exit i will cut it put it into the map section boom boom boom use effect beautiful save it okay okay and then let's go back to my app.js oh it is sorry and i don't really need this at this point right this whole map thing i don't even need this either you know even this at this point now instead of doing map i actually import the whole component i will say import map see and then right away told me that it's inside the components.map right so we create this component we're going to import it now instead of doing this i'll just simply say like this save so let's see will it work will it work let me see let me see it says fail to compile it's okay and if our map has already been declared it's okay because if we scroll here guys you guys can see we have this const map we don't need this remove this save it boom okay wrapper is not defined don't worry because inside the map.js we have this wrapper inside here so we need to create it using const wrapper is equal to what do you guys think what do i do here guys who knows put on the zoom chat put on the youtubes guys what i do here to create the div that's right ralph i do what dot exactly okay i will save it and it's not there for a certain reason because guys remember guys we had this flex one when we defined our map so i'm going to call this flex dash one now and watch our map coming back back again oh it's back it's back okay give me one second okay uh turn off i think people are having trouble with the font and uh really i like the font i i like it too uh i'm just trying to see like what's the best way to turn off italics um i mean yeah i think keep going for now and i'll see if i can figure that out so guys we've got one thing working okay the map is done part one of this is done of course now the next i'm gonna work on is the bottom section guys okay the bottom section of this application so we have all the uber yeah the map is good to go it's it's the actual uber styling nice look you can even scroll through it like if you go ahead and scroll through it zoom out of it it works guys nice okay beautiful pretty cool all right the next section i'm going to work on is inside the inside geos it's going to be the actual action items so as you can see i'm currently here yeah i'll go ahead oh there's and a few things that we've got here guys if we go back to our original app okay i'm going to divide this into a few sections go back to the original add those created ready uh okay cool okay now let's draw those sections that we want to create okay let's draw them out so we've got the top section maybe you can use a rectangle bro the rectangle section all right there we go there we go got the record so we got the header i'm going to call this the header yeah okay after that i'm going to call the other ones called action buttons that's another div and after that i'm going to create something called input in the input box button right so three things we're going to add in there got it yeah so let's go ahead and do that accordingly you know in the actual couple action items here guys is going to be that box right there the actual items is the whole box actually actually honestly is the box around the whole thing right exactly okay so action items will have all of these things in there exactly that's actually our action items inside here we'll have a few things we'll have the header boom and then we'll have the actual action buttons these are the action buttons right there beautiful and then inside here i'm gonna have the input button yep and that's gonna be that where too right so who knows guys who can tell me how do i create a header component a header style component who can tell me in the youtube in a zoom chat how do i create a style component guys who can tell me you know it should be called header you guys give me the actual piece of code i'm curious what do you guys think not an h1 ruben no not an h yes lm that's right so we call a header so i'm gonna say header here yeah header beautiful and i'm just gonna and you can see really it completes it for me okay beautiful it's not defined because you define it i'm not gonna define at the bottom say const header is equal to t w dot div okay yeah beautiful save it done right it's of course you still can't see anything that's okay completely at this point we're going to have a few things the first i'm going to say is an image right there'll be an image here and after that point we will also have a we will also have a what a um profile right so two things you need to add image and profile guys let's first i'm gonna do is to add an actual image i'm going to i have an image here called the uber logo and i'm just going to copy and paste it for you guys so you guys can go ahead and use it right i'm going to say create something called uber uber logo okay and the source it's going to be an image because source is going to be um well i have the source right here so maybe you guys can go and copy and paste it right here the source but david can you explain to everybody how you have google drive where all the images are stored david are you still here is he here or no i don't know of course i am okay hey david you have a google drive that has all the images correct yes so for youtube people it's right down below the description and for everybody else uh inside zoom you guys got an email with another link just click the button it downloads the zip file it has an mdx file which can be opened in vs code which you can add to all the image sources yes and can you do can you can you give them the link as well for the zoom people sure sure sure i'll grab it one second and put it in in the chat that means that while he's doing that guys i'll give you guys a link to the actual uber logo don't worry i got you guys i dropped it and uh zoom yeah yeah yeah i already dropped it okay okay then what we'll do is if you scroll the way down to uber logo let's say equal to tw and who could guess what are we gonna do guys five points for those of you who can guess it is it t w dot one is it tw dot dave or is something else what do you guys think what is it yeah it's t double dot image damn good job guys nice nice people are awake yeah let's go hey we've got the uber logo can we show that showcase that okay let's go take a look yes oh nice here we go it's a pretty big logo yeah massive i'm going to remove this pg red desk 300 because we don't need this yeah do it okay so that's fully white okay great we've got the uber logo the next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to define super look i'm going to give it a height okay for the height i will say h 28 right that's going to give it a height so h stands for height so it's going to make it a little bit smaller and honestly that's that's pretty much it then what i'm going to do is on the profile i will create a few things right i'm going to create a profile container okay profile container and then inside that let's go ahead and do that i'll say profile boom oops and inside that there's two things guys we have the name the name uh for now it's gonna be rafae kazi for example okay and then we've got wakazi at that point we have what the user image right yep user image beautiful now again i'm gonna call like this you might see a difference right guys you see how we have start this up like this and then we end we have an end tag this is a start tag this is an end text those are you who are wondering okay yeah and then but inside here inside an image we don't actually have an end tag but the reason why is pay attention it's called a selfclosing tag selfclosing tag oh why is because here you see this slash at the bottom on the right yeah that's the selfclosing portion okay because of this okay so that's why i wanna just want to showcase to you guys okay for the user image it's also gonna be it's a different source so um i have a different source i have a specific user image let's see if i can grab a user image that i like let me see here i got that right there copy image address right here you can grab any image guys i'm gonna i'm gonna give myself my own image sorry guys you're gonna be me all right let's go okay now i'm going to create those specific divs guys for the profile guys who can tell me what do we create guys kant's profile what before write it out what is it tw dot what dot div okay then we've got of course we've got the name so it's going to create the name one const name is equal to tw dot div as well okay and then finally the last thing is going to be user image now for the user image what is it tw dot what who can guess fireplace can get the user image const user image is equal to what tw dot image yes sam that's right oh not you image all right let's go and save that let's look at our application here in a second here beautiful so we got two things guys we got the uber we've got the rafikaze and we got the image guys okay now we know that we need to have all of our profile stuff on the right hand side right you guys know that at this point now how do we make that work who can actually tell me if you guys can guess to make it work from left to right we use something called something called what not float relax that is right yeah that's right so i will say that on the profile section i will say here this i will say flex watch this a so don't worry that's just that puts the name left inside of this but to make the whole thing flex i go to the header and i say flex yeah right oh do you guys see it by the way yeah do you guys see as i type in flex yeah good you guys do okay we have flex on the header as well okay cool so you guys can see that rafikaze is right there the next thing i want to do is for our header okay i will say flex space and now i'm going to say um it's called justify between now yeah what this does what does it do kazi it will justify between give spaces exactly it it will give as much space as possible between all the things right all the things inside here yeah then after that for the header i'm gonna make align everything uh in a kind of like uh you know to the center so i will say here item center and it's kind of like centered i mean but not yet but you will see it centered in a little bit okay after that i will go ahead and close this out i will go back to my user image and i'm going to modify this image because it's a little bit too big for now okay yeah for the user image i'm going to say that's going to be a height of 12 and a width of twelves okay so that's a h of twelve beautiful it's gonna become a lot smaller great now how do we add those round corners kazi who can tell border radius baby let's go border radius you gotta add that in every time you need those rounded corners that's right and tail and c says it's called rounded full okay let me open that round thank you look how beautiful that is right yeah run it full okay so we're kind of there now next thing i want to do is center the rafikaze portion yeah so i'm going to say in the profile i will say flex items dash center you guys can see me typing right there yep beautiful and i'm going to give a margin right uh 4 on the name so for this name right here i'm going to say mr4 okay and a specific name i'm going to give it a width of 20. okay so far looking pretty good i like the way this is going by the way this is looking good now for the user image back to here guys and now our user image kind of has like a small kind of border that you might not see so far but has a small border okay to give it a border what we need to do is say border here right and i'll say border gray dash i'm going to say it's going to be 200. you might not see it yet why because it's covered by the image okay so to make sure it's everywhere we give it a padding right i'm going to say p dash px save it nice you guys see that blue border kind of like if i do you can see a little border has everywhere if i do p dash two for example three yeah yeah you see that right there that's the border right but if i do ps2px it's only gonna give it a small border nice right there beautiful so so far it's looking not too bad i'm like where this is going the only one they want to modify is for the name i'm going to give it a text of small just to get a small text okay it's just a little smaller text and that's pretty much it guys so we've got our uber we got our thing all is good there how do you think let me ask you this question how do we you see how on the right hand side how our profile is so close to the right edge yeah how do you think we can give a spacing for the right edge you guys can tell me what do we do they're saying padding some are saying margin that's right that's right now if i want to give space on the inside of a box which one we use this one you should definitely get if when i have that what do i do then who can tell me that's right it's gonna be padding guys now i'm going to give padding on the whole actual item this whole thing i'm going to give padding on because this whole thing kind of you know reflects the whole application so for the action items right actual items i will say here p dash four and that will make this a lot smaller like this can you maybe zoom out a little bit kaze because i feel like you zoomed in for your application so it's like it loose looks very okay yeah thank you there we go do you want me to take them out more like this much this is good yeah i like that okay cool i like that all right guys the top header thing is now done okay capiche done now the next thing we're going to work on is what what is the next thing we need to create guys who can tell me what's the next thing do you create it's going to be what section is a cousin huh yeah that's right action buttons hey beautiful by the way guys it looks like your camera is a little bit um out of focus yeah okay there we go that looks good so i'm gonna create the action buttons here action buttons beautiful okay that's gonna be on my container const action buttons is equal to tw dot what div okay beautiful save that we got that section of course you guys can see yeah because it's pretty much nothing so far right inside the action buttons we'll have a few things well we have three buttons guys i'm gonna call action button okay action button that's what i'm gonna call it so let's go ahead and do that right now so i'm gonna say here action buttons guys is gonna be the box that contains all of them right and then the action button is going to be the one button and then he's going to have like three buttons in here like this wants to be for ride another one's going to be for something else it's going to be for the wheel section yeah so these are the buttons he's making right now ride two wheels reserve that's right and then we have the resort action exactly i'm going to call it okay beautiful okay kazi can you go ahead and maybe create a tw div for the action button while get some water please cool go for it all right so here we go uh we're gonna create a basic one so we're gonna do const action button just like this i'm going to do tw button and we can do div here okay cool so we have these three showing up here right now if i want to put them in a row how would i do that guys because right now they are going by columns that's right what do you guys think you can do right yes so a lot of people are saying display flex that's absolutely right so we're gonna have to display flex and then it'll actually show up as a row because that's what we want right we don't want it to be up and down we want it to be in a row just like this and what do you guys think with display flex on on which on which div you guys tell me which one action yes good job good job the plural one nice good job guys that's that was sick so on the action buttons guys i'm gonna say here flex right there right you see now it's from left to right got it so from left to right now okay now a few things i want to add in here because we not only have a button we also have an image inside there okay yeah so the action button i'm going to give it a specific color here so that's the first thing i'm going to do because i just want to want you guys to see so i'm going to say give it a bg that's gray dash 200 okay we can see those colors now right it's pretty simple here and then for the action buttons in order to have it kind of stretch along the whole screen i want the whole thing what i'm going to do is i'm gonna do a kind of like uh a uh i'm gonna give every single one a flax of one right so check this out guys right nice there we go yep right so we have now three buttons they're all the same weight right the same importance and that made them the same equal beautiful i'm going to now add an image inside there right i'm going to create an image called action button image let's go scroll to the top and inside there okay i'm going to create action action button image what is this called guys what kind of a container what kind of a close what kind of closing tag is this called guys who can tell me what is this called so tell me what is it called it's called a salt yeah damn you guys are good nice there we go soft closing tag right i'm going to go to source and the source guys is also guys we have the source and the google drive folder here's the image boom that's our source i'll copy and paste it for you guys maybe kazi can you copy and paste it for us yeah dropping it right now there we go okay beautiful nice so we've got that portion all right of course now i need to create the what the tw dot image so i'm gonna say here const action button image is equal to tw dot image beautiful oh we've got ourselves an image okay so looking pretty good i'm lucky this is going but it's a bit too big which doesn't i don't like so i'm gonna give it a height inside here h dash three fifth right there see so h dash three fifth is our height okay now another thing i want to do is for the action button individual button i'm going to give a specific margin because i want to create some spacing between every single one of them so i will do i will go ahead and do uh m one right here and this one yes we'll see now spacing you see guys yeah there you go that's beautiful and i'm going to give it a height dash 32 nice yeah exactly then i'm going to go ahead and because i need to for every single one of them right or every single one of them i need to center it so who can tell me how do i stand out that way for any questions or anything like that we're going to be taking all of them from you guys at the end okay a lot of the questions we'll take some questions we might be able to take now but most of your questions like if you want to be able to ask them like leave it to the end and we'll cover it yeah exactly so guys how do i go ahead and center the contents inside this dip who can tell me who can tell me yeah justify con that's correct so i will go ahead inside the action button i will say items center good to put in the center right but of course i need to give it a flex first that's as a display flex nice beautiful now you see how it's from left to right because by default flex direction is row by default so to make a column we say what flex dash column see now it's top to bottom yeah then i say justify center beautiful put in the center i like it now everything's centered guys okay that's exactly what we wanted to do also now i'm gonna i'm going to give this specific button a little bit like a rounded right so i'm gonna give it a specific rounded uh corners because i'm not very sharp i'm gonna say rounded lg beautiful hey i like it i like it i like it okay and i will go back up to the action button i'm going to add the same button to every single or the same image every single button let's do that right now guys okay let's do it right now boom nice okay we got the wheels don't worry i'll change the links a second here beautiful okay sweet nice yeah i'm going to copy the image for the actual wheels right here yep basically pasted that image right there you can see it says bike.png at the end and then the code here changed okay yes then i'm going to go to kind of copy and paste um the the next image the reserve one month in here boom let's see hey that looks good yep i'm gonna put it for you guys in the chat as well okay cool cool so we've got the ride we've got the wheels we've got the reserve it looks so good now here's a really cool thing wouldn't it be nice that if you hover over these buttons they kind of respond somehow how cool would that be guys okay so to make that work just like that so let me show you what he's talking about like these ones right here so that little hud gets big like that boom yes so to make it work i will go and open up action button and aside there guys we're going to add a small thing first thing i'm going to say that i can transform this so i want a transformation layer right the fact that we can can you see it as i'm typing by the way um hold on let me yeah i don't know why it's not following you can you move around even i'm following you right now yeah yeah okay there you go yes because it's like all the way in the bottom here okay cool oh i see i see okay so you added just rounded lg transfer uh you just added transform i think though right that's right that's all i added yeah okay yeah cool next i'm gonna do i'm gonna do on the hover guys check this out on the hover colon scale dash 105 let's try it now hover or something hover over something ah nice so there's a little bit of movement going on but we still don't have like that smooth animation just yet yeah to add that all you have to do at this point is just to say transition boom add that and now hey all right see it now yep i see it wow taylor makes that easy look at that i know yeah that's nice next thing add the text texture excel okay uh right there text excel okay so he just made the size of that text much bigger and that's it guy that's it that is it guys okay nice okay next one we need to go ahead after the action buttons you need to add the input button guys okay so i'm gonna call it right here input button yep giri giri krishna says the team is really helping a lot of people learn coding appreciate the effort thanks a lot thank you so much brother appreciate those kind words thank you so i'm gonna create an import button inside there and see where to where to good guys you can tell me now how do i create this in terms of the actual style components who can tell me what i do const input button say goes what tw that do good save that okay now don't see anything right now yet so i'm going to go ahead and give it a specific height so each dash 20 okay bg that's great okay dash 200 nice okay next i'm going to do is i will go ahead and do a text like larger text text to excel okay now how do we add some padding guys who can tell me what is the code if i want to add some padding to this who can tell me what what do i do okay tell me huh yeah that's right it's called p p four yes okay that will put it like this next thing what i wanna do guys is i will go ahead and change the actual center so i'm gonna say flex flex actually item center but we're not done yet not done yet because i need to add a specific margin guys okay you guys can see the virtue is very close to the actual you know everything else i don't like that so how can i add a margin top right how can i add a margin top to this action button so who can tell me what can i do i'm going to margin of this input button yeah that's right empty dash eight hey there we go so now guys we've got all these at this point this is pretty much done in terms of our homepage we've got the ride the wheels the reserve everything guys we've got both of those things got the you know the logo we've got the profile we've got the where to section right i think it looks pretty good guys now what do you think bro looking pretty good yeah we got a lot done today actually not done yet not done yet yeah people are saying peter says amazing we have fire emojis coming in beautiful beautiful peter mercedes hey i like that last name like it's like an actual car brand name [Laughter] beautiful so we've got that portion that's all good now the next thing working on is what can you showcase guys what we're working on next cool so the next thing we're working on guys is going to be when we click ride it takes us to this page over here so that's the next thing that we're actually going to be working on yeah so in nextgs to create our a different page you literally just create a new file inside your pages yeah they make it really simple with uh next because in react you have to do routing and a bunch of stuff in next all you're going to see him do is he's going to create a new page here underneath i'm going to call it search yes yeah and that's automatically going to like as soon as you click ride it'll automatically take you to that page so here's search okay and to be able to go to the search page that he made so uh yeah just add in something right so i'm gonna call the search i'm not making capital the reason why i'm making the class names capital because that's a good uh convention to go by cool and even if he says like something like hello here i can actually do at the end of this local host i can go slash search right and uh it actually brings me to that page right here so uh that's a really nice part about next yeah i like that a lot too i like that a lot too so if we know oh dang what happened here i don't know yeah okay now here's the cool thing though how do we link our ride to text page how do we do that okay well in next year we have something called the link so i will go ahead and show this to you guys if we go up we have import link from next link that's right so in usual html you have like each a you know a shrek you know stuff like that but because we're using a different technology we're using links and where do you guys think we're going to put links around who can tell me where you're putting links around who can tell me what is it what is the thing we're putting the links around what is it no no not the ride well yeah i think i'll keep the ride but what is the button yeah that's right the button yes it is technically the right but yes so inside here i will say link shref is equal to dash search that's right that's all you have to do guys okay and then at end that link yep and this link is coming from uh hold on one second just before you start typing this link is yeah so again i know knowledge just showed you this but just remember this okay you're getting importing this link cool exactly so we're importing this link and this link says hey to which page are we going to we're going to the search page so if i go and save this save that so if you click on the kazi on the right section boom takes me to the home page right up there beautiful okay now in the search page a few things need to happen to make this work so let's just i think just get started on that one right away okay yeah let's go inside yes oh too source ideas sorry inside search engine yes i will kind of modify this i will import all my basic stuff import tail and css copy from there paste it say done done at this point instead of dip i'm gonna call the wrapper that's the usual thing beautiful there we go okay i'm gonna put um kind of practice around this because usually we have parentheses but because of is linting it kind of makes it cleaner so that's okay i kind of like it like this though rapper there we go beautiful yeah what did we do now guys what do you think we do how do we create a tail when the css wrapper what do we do here i say what const wrapper tw dot div that's right t dot with that div okay okay now inside that okay what are the components that we have so if we go back to our our top section kazi okay let's go back to the application that's actually been created okay so go to the home page or what do you want me where do you want me to go the no no not the but the actual application has been created already the one that has been created okay yeah click on ride uhhuh okay and so let's look at the components that we have here okay our first component what do you guys think is the first component guys what is the first component we got what do we got not the input no that's right the back button right so let's go and put a square around the back button this one right here that's right that's our first thing the next thing is going to be the hole in the contains the input stuff so everything that's from the the image to the input stuff that's one big container so it's going to create that nice yep beautiful next one is the safe places yep and then confirm locations that guys is it that's it that's all we have to create okay so let's go ahead and create that right now first this thing is gonna be the button container yeah i'm gonna say button container it's going to create some structure from me container boom all right within that and we're going to have what the actual i'm going to call the input container yeah input container and i'm just doing this guys for convention i'm just putting it so i can see myself wanting to create next yeah and these are just comments just so you know okay then we have saved places and then we have confirm location not location my location but yeah beautiful okay now let's start with the button container okay let's create our butter container okay dinner good beautiful okay inside that guys we're gonna create the actual image so let's create a back button back button okay all right and the source of this back button is we've got it for you right here so i've got the best source of the back button you put free guys in the png everywhere okay i'll put the source for you in the zoom boom good okay here's the source got the source here it's gonna save that all right so that's our back button yeah see so i can see it myself okay now not defined of course we need to current define it so let's go ahead and do const button container beautiful equals to tw div you know the spiel at this point guys yeah the huge the huge [Laughter] then we got the const back button yeah yeah this is a pattern like once you guys keep seeing it again and again it's gonna be the similar thing right tw dot img t tw dot div and then back tick back tick and you kind of like get in a flow of it when you keep doing style components exactly now we've got the container we've got the button can we showcase what we got quasi yeah here we go hey we've got the button yeah got the button so next thing i'm gonna go the wrapper here inside here i'm going to give it a background color of gray because the whole thing is great so bg dash great that you can tell me what is the number who can guess what is the number needs to be jquery which one are we using the 400 the 500 or the 600 which one are we using bj gray what no it's neither one of them it's actually 200 guys yeah fabio that's right muscle memory that's right bg gray dish 200 you guys can see that it's you know how it is to make everything guys full height what do we use to make the whole thing the scree the height screen what do we do h what dash screen nice good beautiful honestly that's pretty much it honestly so we gotta do with that one then the see if i want to add a maybe like a specific like padding but i think i'm good for now yeah most importantly we got the other container with the panda container background color white how do we do that guys pg god my voice is killing me it's like i'm trying to speak it's like literally just like stabbing me in the back in the throat i'm like slowly dying inside just to be honest with you guys um so anyways we got bj dash white yeah all right so guys give that guys a thumbs up because we're done and out here for you yeah guys give it up for us for all that freaking effort oh my god i'm drinking water it's just not helping you know yeah it's that streamer life seriously i keep says you guys are amazing thank you brother appreciate it it's like no matter like you try to talk and just like no you can't yeah so we've got my section that's all cool i'm going to give this button container a uh actual a specific height so i'm going to say h 10 guys okay we've got the height uh i kind of like worm well yeah that's fine actually actually let's not give the height i don't like it that way that that kind of limited a few space for it which is not cool uh but what i do like about is i do want to give a padding so p p x dash four now if you don't know what does p x stand for what do you think it stands for guys px stands for what no not pixels yes mitchell it stands for the padding on the xaxis that's right right here pxport okay you guys can see that i kind of added the the thing right here got it and uh you know under the section of the padding beautiful okay we got that the the bun container i'm gonna give with the button the actual back button we'll go ahead and give it a h12 okay beautiful okay nice yeah that's all good next one we've got the input container that's the hardest one yup input container all right my throat should survive for the next hopefully half hour got the input container wow now what do we have guys remember we divide this the input container can be divided into three sections okay let's go back to our application kazi yep the deployed one here we go yep so we've got the last section that has those images you see those images that like has the circle with the square yep yep yep this one that's the first that's the first thing next thing is what which one guys who can tell me can you guess which one is it it is gonna be the no not the location the no not the plus no no no no no no no well it's the actual input boxes themselves that's the next yeah div both of them so two of them are gonna be in one two of them gonna be in one uh whole thing yeah so if you maybe put or put a square around it or whatever and then the third one is gonna be which one the plus section right that's gonna be the third container beautiful okay that's the three container so let's go ahead and create that in the input container i will call this something called a from two icons that's right so from two i can't good maybe if i speak like this i'll be okay okay go okay okay from two icons that's kind of created as a const const is equal to what from two no no that's right that's wrong both two icons guys okay good t w dot div good okay you got that you got inputting undefined that's perfect don't worry about it we got you okay let's do what const input container yeah good papa is equal to t double dot div as well save it and we're good and dandy guys okay at least then gets nearer beautiful inside this we've got three things okay we've got the circle portion okay i'm going to click it right now circle circle circle okay good and that's going to be what an image so give it a specific image source is equal to an image guys good i'm going to copy pasta for you go go pasta good save it of course it's going to give us an error i'll give you i got you guys pasta dylan says that's right circle i yeah let's define that yeah so circle i had to paste it in for everybody in the zoom so const circle is equal to what tw image and let me see do we got it okay is that a circle is that a line it's like a weird circle yeah it's a weird line oh because i picked i copy pasta the wrong thing um i got you don't worry i pasted in the line here here's the circle boom command v yep that's the circle circle there you go someone said get blood there's like black gross pasta i know it was not a circle you did not love to live up to your expectations not the right pasta now how about now is this is this the right pasta guys technically the lime was the right pasta because that actually is closer to positive than the circle is so you know okay because pasta you know it's a no never mind we got line okay same thing okay we got the source all right beautiful line source and now i've got the right line so now i'm going to get that hopefully i'll get the right pause at this time okay i'll place it for you guys in the zoom chats i'll define at the bottom const line is equal to what tw dot image as well save it okay we got the big line and finally the last thing is going to be what the square get the square i'll call the square square okay source is equal to a square same thing copy pasta this one as well i got you guys let's go ahead and end this up it's just go what does this call it again guys who knows what kind of attack is this who knows what kind of tag is this one that's selfclosing baby yeah let's go okay save it we've got the square screen i defined don't worry i got you cons square so let's kind of create this inside what nice w dot image save it beautiful so this is creating circles which are pretty big of course don't worry we'll make it smaller i got you guys okay now the first resource i want to work on is the from two icons okay uh they're kind of like you know you can just give it a specific width that's the most important thing so for the front two icons let's go down here and change the way it works so i'll give it a width 10 that should make it right away smaller okay now i'm going to give it a specific uh kind of like um flex yeah flex beautiful nice but of course not this one i'm going to give flex column nice okay next i'm gonna do is i will go and do how do we center these guys who knows because if you guys can say i mean they're pretty much centered now at this point but you know not the way you wanted to however i do want to change the input container right the ipo container right now is the whole thing so we want to change the input container to be what color bg white okay let's change it let's see hey beautiful so that looks pretty good i kind of like where that's coming from okay now next thing i'm gonna do is i will go ahead and add the actual input uh buttons themselves don't worry we'll go back to the actual circles and squares to make that a little bit smaller i got you right inside the input container guys we'll create input boxes for people to actually use okay beautiful got the input boxes i like it okay nice okay input boxes that's good now of course inside here the input boxes will have the input that's actually going to be the input that we'll use for the you know for the whole uh when you when you guys type it in so input good and for the input guys i mean nothing so far but there's two inputs here we got one another one but so far it's kind of nothing okay i'll go to input boxes let's go ahead and create a simple boxes const input boxes beautiful is equal to tw dot dip shouldn't still work don't worry but i will go ahead and const input i think to that without what guys who can you can get me okay who can guess what is it cw dot what is it yeah damn that one you guys got it so gw dot input let's see okay they don't show up it's okay okay because you need to give them a specific height guys don't worry okay so now we don't really see them all we need to do is now modify the input to make sure it actually kind of works and it's kind of there right so let's go ahead and give it a number one in height so i'm going to h10 beautiful okay i will go ahead and give it a bgray dash 200 huge shout out by the way to everybody that's still here like y'all are champs this i know this is hard and i know this is confusing anthony's yeah anthony's going off but like seriously give yourselves a huge like pat on the back this seriously is awesome like because yes because it's tricky to be able to pay attention for this long but guys like this is what coding and development is yes yes it is it is so guys you guys can see we got the two buttons right here we got can you maybe you see how those two buttons you don't really see them but i will add a placeholder so if we go ahead and do a placeholder here holder is and you will see it none then placeholder and i want to say for placeholder uh your location so let's go ahead and set enter pickup location enter pickup location okay you guys can see it right there right right array and the next is going to be place folder is equal to uh where to boom okay so two buttons now now of course what you can see is they're kind of like on top of each other right so the input boxes one is underneath the from two icons right so this whole info box is underneath the from two icons how do we make sure they go from left to right who can tell me guys quick question huh what can we do what can we do what do you guys think yeah that's right we need to go and flex it okay so let's go ahead and go to the bottom go to input container and we say flex okay nice beautiful now it's from left to right okay and then at that point what i'm going to do is for the entrepreneurship and the where to input boxes how to make it go from top to bottom what do you do now do you guys think that's right we flex columns we say flex here and we say flex dash column there we go right there we go that's exactly what we want to do for the input flexes for the input boxes we wanted to take up as much space as possible so i'm going to give it a flex of one save it there you go so now it's taking up as much space as possible also the same time i'm going to give it a margin y so for every every single input right you see how they're stuck together let's go ahead and separate them so i'm going to say um mytwo that gives what is it what do you guys think this y stands for what does y stand for you can tell me that's right overage it is the yaxis so basically padding on the yaxis top and bottom like vertical padding that's right vertical padding right m x is like the xaxis that's the horizontal padding okay that's our input beautiful the input as well i'm going to give it a round it because remember it's kind of like edgy right now which i don't like so i'm going to say here a rounded two get a specific grounding so it's kind of starting is it there it's kind of there maybe not there rounded dash two and then what i'll do at that point is let's see is is p dash to give the padding okay beautiful so that you can see that the pickup location kind of separates from everything and the one thing i want to do you see how whenever can you click into the pickup location quasi sure uh click into right here there we go you guys can see that you have this blue box that we don't like it's like a weird box that i'm not a big fan of you know yeah let's get rid of that yeah let's get rid of that yeah to get rid of that what i say is like it's it's called an outline those of you who don't know it's called an outlier so the first thing i'm going to say is outline here outline dash boom save it okay now click into into it again nice gone all right yeah that's right it is exactly exactly gone right beautiful so that seems to be all good so we've got those two things it looks pretty good the next thing to work on is gonna be the plus button okay the plus button which we need as well so let's go ahead and go back to our you know think the bob okay and underneath the input container actually no inside we're still technically inside the input container we need to create a plus button container that's right so i'm just going to go ahead and create the plus button here so i'm going to say plus icon boom right here plus icon self closing source is equal to what specific source which i got right here beautiful right there i'll copy past it for you guys everybody and then zoom that's right kevin taylon is awesome i agree with that okay save it let's go back to the bottom what is it lost what plus icon is equal to t w that what guys tell me see that by that image that's right let's see how it looks like now oh my god that's pretty bad that's pretty bad don't worry i got you we'll fix it okay we got you so the first thing i'm going to do is for the image let's give the width and the height so width 10 and h10 okay okay so now it's a little better hopefully okay i'm going to go ahead and give it a round of applause now to make it into like a full circle the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to do a bg great so bg dash gray dash 200 that's going you see right there that's the thing right so that's all good okay but how do i go ahead and make it so that it's a fullon rounded circle what do i do here kazi give it yeah border radius 50 50 but with tail it says we're using the called rounded full boom see right there just like that it is the way we want it okay um now you see how it's very close to the pickup location all the input stuff i will say margin left dash let's just say it's like margin left three maybe or is it margin margin is it not doing that no no that's that's that's the input sorry not on this one i don't want the plus icon ml string there we go beautiful and the one other thing i want to do is i want to make sure everything is centered vertically so who can tell me how do i center everything vertically make sure that everything even the plus icon is all centered vertically what do i do who can tell me it's literally like two lines of code guys what i do not a reverse not reverse item center that's right but on which component on this one on this one or on this one which component or maybe even a different component it's actually going to be on the input container guys so on the input container i will do flex that's so good but i will do items dash center boom you see the plus icon right away is right there on the bottom okay next i'm going to do is i will going to create some spacing for everything so for the input container guys let's go ahead and go back to input container scroll down boom boom boom let's create some spacing guys okay so i'm gonna say one p x dash four you're gonna space it from left to right okay so it's a little bit cleaner now and also for the actual uh with the from two icon right i'm also creating some spacing as well because i just kind of don't like the way it is so i will have here with the from two icon that's for the bottom whereas there is a wizard with the wizard wizard from two icons okay i will say margin the right is what maybe like two okay i'm liking this okay i'm liking this already beautiful i'm also going to say for the input container i will say margin bottom because i want to have space in the bottom section say margin bottom dish too as well like christmas place on the bottom too did it let's see come on did it no maybe the bottom maybe it's on the actual let me see here yeah input container all right here mb2 no okay nevermind okay so oh but yes it did it created margin but because remember guys margin is the spacing on the outside guys remember right margin is spacing on the outside okay okay now let's look at these circles they're a bit too big i don't like it so every circle gonna define give the height for the circle i'm gonna say this is a height of h2 2.5 so h right here h of 2.5 oops 2.5 save okay don't worry about it we'll figure it out okay and then finally for the line a h of 10 okay h10 don't worry okay and then for the square as well it's gonna be h of three guys okay the square is gonna be h of three each test three save it okay don't worry we got you okay so now you see how it's all stretched out you see on the right hand side it's all stretched out doesn't look good at all so make it work okay there's a really cool trick that i like to use because what is trying to do is you're trying to take up as much space you know in terms of like um horizontally and that's all because of flex guys okay flex that makes it do that so if i go to the input container here all right i'm sorry the actual from two icons okay you guys see where i'm typing right yeah the from two icons okay i will say here items the center boom you see that magically just fix it all magic is fixed up because item center is put in the center and so it prevents the divs from trying to stretch as much as possible that's the cool part about it okay so we got the word too we've got all this stuff looking pretty good i'm lucky this is going beautiful okay good good good okay the last thing we're going to do is i'm going to create the safe places so we've got the input container guys that's all good the last thing is going to be well the saved places that's pretty easy one honestly uh all we'll do is create a div here they have here called saved places so i'm gonna say here saved places here outside the input container so i'm say here saved places beautiful okay and inside here there's a few things we've got we've got the icon so let's click the star icon start icon and has a source is equal to something okay and there you go i'll give you guys the image right now in a second here so i'm going to copy and paste the image for you so i've got the image right here boom i'll place it for you guys in the zoom boom okay beautiful and then at that i'm gonna say i'm gonna say saved places for text beautiful then it's underneath here guys we're gonna create the actual style component of it okay let's go and do this const saved places is equal to tw dot what tw dot dot what tw dot div that's right okay good good good good good and then after that i'm going to say here const star icon which one do we use guys who could tell me who could somebody get at this point you guys should know at this point two what that image that's right fabio beautiful you've got both those things okay so there we go we've got that little icon okay i want to make this icon right here uh to have a square so i'm going to give for the star icon i'm giving it like a background color so let's do bg gray bg dash gray dash 400 oops now now grade s400 okay okay that's the bg gray right now okay great i like it i'm going to give it a width and a height because it's a bit too big guys so width that's 10 and then height dash 10. okay a little bit smaller now all good next i'm going to give it is a padding of 2 p 2 is going to be it's going to create some space and inside that's there we go exactly what i want and then finally i'm going to make it round how to make it rounded who knows at this point we've done it multiple times you guys should know at this point it's gonna be what what is the css thing and not too rounded full that's right rounded dash full save it hey you've got the rounded circle beautiful i like it i like it how do i do the safe places how do i make the safe places go from the bottom to the right section what i do guys what do i do you tell me not running full black that's right flex so we'll say on the on the saved places i'm gonna say flareflex good flex it okay now how do i center everything i say what items dash center we're almost done honestly center beautiful also i'm gonna do the following i'm gonna say background colors white so bg dash white to make sure this white is white as well okay i like it i'm going to give it a small padding guys for the whole uh safe places i'll do p x 4 4 to make sure it aligns with everything else and p y dash 2. and you guys can see that whenever i create padding it makes everything bigger right so it's like if i create space inside the box my box expands right so you guys will see that my let's let's make this bikes wide let's read for example red 500 okay if i made it ready for 100 you guys can see right it's a very thin box but if i do a padding vertical what do you think will happen to the box what will happen to the box guys what will happen to the box who can tell me that's right the the rebel expand so p y dash i will call it uh two there we go that's what you guys need to understand is that padding expands things okay back to white okay then i'm to give it uh the icon i'm going to do a small margin for the icon so that mr dash 2 or the dash one interesting dash 2 is fine there we go we've got the same places that looks looking pretty good okay and guys i think that's uh well i think that's pretty much it my friend i think you've got them you've got that because the rest i just want to give you guys for homework okay yeah the race i wanted to get for homework guys i have a few things i want you guys i want you guys to do for homework make sure you guys you know have something to do for the next time okay i think should be i think that one should be fun um but yeah i'm lucky this is how you guys what do you guys think this is pretty good i'm lucky this is going i'm liking where this is going guys so what do we have quasi we're done quasi yeah that's it so we're done with our section today guys now i have homework let's go back to our application that's been done already cool let's go okay okay so we can see that the confirmed locations that one has not been created yet guys so i want you guys to create a button called confirm locations so you follow the same form as we did create that dip create the component do two dot div right just how we did it create that component and just make it into like you know make it background color black with literally just stacks in the center yeah and make sure the text is centered that's pretty much it okay yep that's your homework your homework and then to find the last thing is gonna be to for the back button to link the back button guys okay yeah so link linking it means like when you click that back button it takes you to the previous page that's right so guys what do we have done let's showcase what we have done so far awesome guys so check it out look at how much we have gotten done today right so we have this page over here done and we got this page right over here done isn't that freaking awesome guys that's amazing man right like this is something that usually takes developers weeks right or such a long time to build we're over here building it for you all in under like two or three hours so if you guys thought naz did a great job guys give it up for freaking nas that was awesome i want to see it from every single person hey let's always says everybody thank you guys chad is blowing up great job nas this was awesome however it's like nas needs some honey and some tea yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah take care of your voice bro take care of your voice i know what happened i think it just it got colder here i think it got colder a little bit here you know where we live and so it's like i don't know guys we don't want to take too long on this one for you guys okay we want to let you go to sleep earlier and what we want you to be able to do is get to the work earlier so you can do your homework and finish it off so we're not going to take too many questions today what we want to do is we want to make sure that you guys can do your homework okay um finish that up it's going to be just that button that's going to be there and then more can you put that into the actual um let's put that into the actual presentation okay um i can see it what do you think do we have the presentation or no i don't i think we just put it right here so guys home homework right is uh finish the button okay make the button the confirm button yes confirm button that's part one and then uh and then the other homework is gonna be to link the um the back button back to the home page yep link back button to home page to the home page all right guys that's it thanks those are the two things you gotta do okay that's your homework one and two all right get these done and most importantly guys what time are we going live tomorrow can you let us know what time are we going live tomorrow that's right that's right beautiful okay who's gonna be there i want to hear from you who's coming to it and he's like yo i'm coming to it me me me me i will be there awesome that's great yeah okay guys so we're gonna we're we're gonna go right but make sure that you guys show up tomorrow 5 p.m sharp pacific time okay we're gonna be ready to rock and roll you know day day three of the challenge and it's gonna be the second day of the uber build we're going to be getting ready to rock and roll this is your homework okay with that said um hold on recording guys uh if you want to rewatch recording we'll be on youtube guys this whole thing has been on youtube so if you are on zoom go to youtube it takes maybe like five ten minutes for you to process all of this because it's a live video and then you should see it on there but let's just get like five ten minutes maximum guys and you should be all good okay yep absolutely i'm gonna add you here okay cool so everybody who's been watching this on youtube guys smash that like button okay subscribe to the channel so this video goes out to more people and so you can see more things about these types of builds okay uh this was building uber day one all right who's going to be here uh i just show of hands who's going to be up later tonight finishing part one yes me yeah nice peter says me jose nice we have an amazing community by the way guys if you want to join the community that will be working on this we literally had people together working and sharing their screen working in their portfolio it was pretty awesome inside discord i loved it it was so amazing guys so i highly comment guys go to cleverpromo.com discord and you'll see it there okay absolutely make you know the most important that you guys can do in coding is make networks and make connections that's probably like that's that's honestly like how you grow as a developer people and so forth yeah guys i so i know like some of you felt overwhelmed actually why don't you just say it uh raise your hands if you felt either overwhelmed today or just drop it in the chat i'd love to see it okay i know that this is i know a lot of a lot of me so what i want to say is what we've been saying from the start right these these coding days are going to feel a little overwhelming and just keep in mind this is pretty advanced stuff that we're doing okay so we're gonna be trying to simplify it for you guys um but when we're showing you this big build and if we're building uber it's gonna be a little bit complex but our goal with this challenge is to show you how coding works so let me ask you this at least was it enjoyable for you to watch has this been an enjoyable experience yes beautiful thank you guys okay very much so please thank you guys appreciate it but more i was watching the more i was definitely understanding peter says absolutely i liked it but a little bit fast okay it seems doable but i'm a newbie okay thank you the coding part was good but i followed the process to all the packages yep okay so that's the idea right it's this is going to be a lot that we're going to be doing for you know from complete step by step and all of that stuff if you guys want to ever learn it of course we have videos on youtube okay and just look out for day five because we got something special for you guys where we will give you something that's going to be really really awesome for you okay so just be on the lookout for that outside of that if you want to pick up the basic basic beginner stuff our youtube is filled with that okay html css javascript all those types of tutorials are up there with that said i think the homework for you guys is clear does everybody understand the homework give me a thumbs up or something if you understand the homework okay cool nice i like it making that black button that's it all right cool um and yeah with that said watch this video again tonight for a lot of you who weren't able to code along at the same time watch this video tonight and team up with somebody in the discord channel from this community and build this part of the app okay yes if you guys were overwhelmed like i said just rewatch the video pause it pause it you know because there is something special about you taking your time to watch this right no matter what kind of a teacher you have or you know however time a teacher spends with you there's something special about literally just sitting down in your computer going through a video pause a little by little doing it with yourself you know you're going to learn you're going to learn a ton a ton more right that's right so you learn a lot today with us as you watched it okay this is like the presentation for you guys right you guys enjoyed the energy right you saw the issues the errors we had now take it implement it put into your code and tomorrow i want to see the homework done yes i want the homework done absolutely we want to see your links we'll link you to the airtable so put your links in there guys i know you're asking us for the source code but there's gonna be some people that have done it and they can share it with you okay so this is we wanna do it this way so you're like forced to talk to other people and make friendships and not just look at our code download it and use it okay so do that okay and i think you're gonna find a lot of friends and you'll be able to use their source code i'm sure they'll share it with you okay yeah i mean i can show the social we should just share it through github i can potentially share it what do you think sure we can even share it with you guys through github and then we can link it to you guys and you'll see either in your email or in the discord yeah i'll show you i'll upload my our source code to github and then we'll send you guys the link so you guys can see it okay awesome guys with that said we love your beautiful face this is qazi and this is nice and if you enjoyed it give us some comments some love and with that said we'll see you guys tomorrow for day three see you guys tomorrow at 5 p.m set your alarms set your freaking alarms set your alarms love you guys take care guys love all of you take care bye bye guys bye
