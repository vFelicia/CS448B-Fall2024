00:00 - you guys i want to talk about the top
00:02 - designing ui
00:04 - resources that you can use as a
00:06 - developer
00:08 - so i feel like tools and having a good
00:11 - toolkit
00:12 - you know around you if you're a
00:13 - developer is going to do you great
00:15 - justice in the world because ultimately
00:18 - i wrote about this in one of our emails
00:21 - actually
00:21 - we were talking about you know how each
00:24 - different artist uses different type of
00:26 - tools so if you are
00:27 - let's say a painter you use paint
00:29 - brushes and paint and if you are
00:31 - you know a construction worker you use
00:33 - maybe you know rulers
00:35 - and an actual just just in general tools
00:39 - right
00:39 - that help you make that job but us as
00:41 - you as ui ux designers
00:44 - and developers we need tools that help
00:46 - us build you know the websites that we
00:47 - need
00:48 - and things of the sort so that's why i
00:49 - started this list
00:51 - how's everybody doing checking out

01:07 - feels like most of the videos that you
01:09 - do man you're going over resources and
01:11 - you're teaching us a bunch of things but
01:12 - do we really want to know those things
01:14 - i'd say yes you do want to know these
01:16 - things just because of the fact that if
01:18 - you do

03:54 - and it's an amazing website that i
03:57 - actually want to dive deep into
03:59 - in this video and if i click on it it's

04:26 - traversing but it's a little bit
04:28 - prettier right you want to go and learn
04:30 - about what type of apps or tools you can
04:32 - use as a designer
04:33 - in design systems you'll go into you
04:35 - know
04:36 - here in design systems right if you want
04:38 - to go and check out
04:39 - mock-up tools you go into mock-up tools
04:41 - and you'll see animal mock-up and then
04:44 - you click on the link

05:28 - just missed a few resources man you
05:29 - might want to go back and
05:31 - pick up those things because it might
05:32 - save you a lot of time let me see who
05:34 - else is here
05:35 - nice people from turkey nigeria logan
05:37 - hey frankie what's up brother
05:38 - what's up logan how you doing man uh
05:41 - hopefully man you can enjoy this i'm
05:42 - going over a fun
05:43 - a few fun things so going over you know
05:46 - specifically going into the laws of ux
05:49 - i feel like this is a great little thing
05:51 - to have because you know as you're
05:53 - starting a design sometimes
05:55 - you kind of just project you kind of
05:58 - want to project or just experiment what
05:59 - you want to try
06:01 - you know depending on what you feel
06:02 - looks nice and sometimes you even you
06:05 - haven't even tested you know the
06:07 - the actual practicality of your buttons
06:10 - you haven't
06:10 - resorted to heat maps or anything like
06:12 - that to tells you to tell you you know
06:14 - the
06:14 - history of a user's mapping of a user or
06:17 - anything like that
06:19 - i think it's amazing if you can go into
06:22 - a website that
06:22 - shows you a little bit more about
06:24 - details of use
06:26 - like this one specifically it's 20 loss
06:28 - of ux
06:29 - and this is law number one apparently
06:30 - you know aesthetic usability effect
06:32 - users often perceive aesthetically
06:34 - pleasing design as design that's more
06:37 - usable amazing so it's
06:40 - two birds in one stone then you go into
06:41 - two and two
06:43 - is productivity source when a computer
06:45 - and its users interact at a pace
06:48 - less than 400 milliseconds that ensures
06:50 - that neither has to wait on the other so
06:52 - wow already it's giving you tweaks
06:55 - practical tweaks you can use
06:56 - on your design to make a specific change
06:59 - in interactability
07:01 - and if you want to go deeper you can go
07:03 - into every law i mean
07:04 - i think it's great as a reminder but i
07:06 - think it's also cool just to have around
07:08 - before you start
07:09 - to go into design and here i wanted to
07:12 - add this little gif
07:13 - because i thought it was funny man i
07:14 - love this movie um zootopia
07:16 - if anybody has seen it drop it in the
07:17 - comments below what is up guys how is
07:19 - everybody doing their front end is
07:21 - somewhat of a designer as well yep
07:22 - i agree man sound fantastic official
07:26 - just said i agree man it has a lot to do
07:28 - with design
07:29 - and ultimately design drips into any
07:31 - every other part of
07:33 - development as well so going into
07:36 - photography and video which is a huge
07:38 - part of just any website if you see any
07:40 - websites in general you can see an image
07:42 - here
07:42 - you can see you know specifically you
07:44 - know how the spacing looks the hover
07:46 - effects the shadows all of these things
07:48 - are part of
07:48 - effects part sorry part of design and in
07:51 - general graphic design and in general
07:53 - just
07:53 - part art in general you know if you're
07:55 - doing if you're doing sketches if you're
07:58 - doing
07:58 - all these things all these principles
07:59 - apply the shadows the hover effects all
08:01 - of these things
08:02 - right this is a great resource that i
08:04 - myself love we use it a lot here in the
08:06 - team
08:07 - it's called remove.bg and remove.bg is
08:09 - awesome because it saves you a lot of
08:11 - time instead of going into photoshop
08:12 - taking out a background what you're
08:14 - going to do is go into remove.bg and do
08:17 - i have it here
08:18 - i do have it here man so you literally
08:21 - literally just drag
08:22 - let's see let's drag um
08:25 - do i have any images here chilling
08:30 - it's because this one doesn't have a
08:31 - background let's see what is this
08:34 - okay for the sake of for the sake of it
08:36 - or the live i'm not gonna do it live
08:38 - but i mean you drag an image there and
08:39 - it pretty much takes off
08:41 - the background and that's amazing to
08:44 - save you time
08:45 - canva is a tool that i really really
08:47 - love i know it's been you know
08:49 - mentioned a lot so many people love
08:50 - canva so many people never actually a
08:52 - lot
08:53 - canvas a response is responsible for
08:55 - making so many people not learn
08:56 - photoshop because they're like oh man i
08:58 - don't even need photoshop i can use
08:59 - canva
09:00 - but canva is has been tested throughout
09:03 - time
09:04 - and people still use it it's a great
09:06 - resource if you want to use
09:07 - you know different let's go over it a
09:09 - little bit if you want to go
09:11 - into it and use maybe you know you can
09:13 - use it as photoshop you can use it as
09:16 - as you know social media posts
09:18 - inspiration
09:19 - you can use it as having layouts and
09:22 - templates
09:23 - for social media maybe you want to do
09:25 - you know inspirational posts
09:27 - for your channel your instagram
09:29 - something like that
09:30 - you can use it flyers you know
09:32 - presentations
09:33 - even for instagram stories so
09:36 - canva already saves you so much time
09:40 - and i feel like right now it's it's it's
09:42 - such a big time for
09:44 - for consistency and you know if you are
09:47 - a developer
09:48 - and you are a designer as well a lot of
09:52 - design in general right now has to do
09:55 - has
09:55 - needs a lot of consistency and i mean
09:57 - consistency
09:59 - in the term of you need massive
10:01 - distribution of your work you're always
10:03 - pumping out content you're always
10:05 - pumping account if you're a designer for
10:06 - a specific brand
10:08 - you might always be pumping out whether
10:10 - that's you know inspirational quotes
10:11 - or anything of the sort or also yo
10:14 - frankie is back good to see you man hey
10:15 - what's up arifat
10:16 - nice to nice to see you brother thank
10:18 - you for having me here but
10:20 - yeah what was i saying um yep
10:23 - consistency man
10:24 - and these tools that make it easier for
10:26 - you to finalize work
10:28 - are gonna make you the difference
10:29 - between you and the person
10:31 - working next to you they're gonna give
10:33 - you an edge so these tools are gonna
10:35 - keep you consistent and that's why i
10:37 - like it
10:38 - pixels is really nice because a lot of
10:40 - times when i'm editing a video
10:42 - or i'm you know whether i'm doing a
10:44 - landing page anything of that sort i
10:46 - always think about
10:48 - having a nice background for example
10:51 - here in this pixels website this is a
10:53 - screenshot of the pixels website and
10:55 - pixels pretty much
10:56 - is you know free stock images so you
10:58 - search any image right here
11:00 - let's actually do it because i put the
11:02 - link here let's put
11:03 - let's find i like dogs but let's let's
11:06 - look for cats
11:08 - boom you see all the images that you can
11:09 - use for free
11:11 - of cats different sizing all of these
11:14 - things right
11:15 - so pixels is really really nice you can
11:17 - also do the same thing with
11:18 - videos so it has 162 videos 3.23 k
11:23 - photos and you can use all of these
11:25 - videos as well so pixels is really nice
11:28 - i don't know what users is people i'm i
11:30 - guess okay users
11:32 - and so that's a great great resource i
11:34 - feel
11:35 - for example they're using a an actual
11:38 - image
11:38 - behind it and it's very common for you
11:41 - know
11:42 - website design right now to have images
11:44 - in the background
11:45 - or even videos on the background that's
11:46 - also very common you can see it on the
11:48 - top major websites right now the most
11:50 - popular ones at least
11:52 - we're at 85 likes people thank you guys
11:54 - for watching if you guys are here right
11:55 - now
11:56 - make sure you smash that like button
11:58 - because i'm giving you guys fire
12:00 - if you do use this in your day-to-day
12:02 - life i assure you
12:03 - that your skills are just going to go up
12:04 - and up and up because not only
12:06 - are we showing you guys resources but
12:08 - the fun
12:09 - part about these resources is you can
12:11 - actually get inspiration you can
12:12 - actually
12:13 - extract and absorb all of these skills
12:16 - to your own skill set and actually apply
12:18 - them
12:18 - right so that's gonna improve your
12:20 - income improve your skills improve you
12:22 - as a person and the impact that you can
12:24 - do whether that's on a company or for
12:26 - yourself
12:27 - so moving forward we're going to talk
12:29 - about iso republic it's the same thing
12:31 - with images i'm not going to go into it
12:33 - it's
12:33 - pretty much the same thing as what was
12:36 - this pixels
12:37 - so you know it's the same type of
12:39 - concept
12:40 - it's it's another option for you guys
12:42 - because i do use both of them i
12:44 - like both of them i prefer pixels in my
12:46 - opinion
12:47 - but here is another example of it and
12:50 - cover i
12:50 - really really loved because i felt like
12:53 - this is one of the
12:54 - type of products that the workplace i'm
12:57 - sorry the market
12:58 - just requires let me take a little bit
13:00 - of water
13:05 - um i see you guys here alexander what's
13:07 - up man greetings
13:08 - i i love that guy he's always i don't
13:10 - know why he always um every time he
13:11 - sends something he has a plus sign
13:13 - in front of of his word i don't know if
13:15 - he's doing like a
13:17 - git committee or something but that's
13:18 - pretty funny anyways cover i feel like
13:21 - it's
13:21 - kind of a product that the market just
13:23 - required it
13:24 - somehow because so many websites use
13:27 - videos
13:28 - in their landing page you know i think
13:31 - cover has a video behind it
13:33 - yep so it has a video behind it and it's
13:36 - it's very common nowadays i think some
13:38 - nike websites
13:39 - have it like that a bunch of websites
13:40 - have it like that so let's see maybe
13:42 - vampires
13:43 - and you can look for stock footage
13:46 - there's actually
13:47 - none no no vampires if you want to use
13:49 - vampire
13:50 - footage probably don't don't use cover
13:52 - guys but okay so we're looking at this
13:55 - and you can just extract it for free and
13:57 - use it on your website
13:58 - cover is amazing it really does add a
14:01 - lot of
14:02 - depth a lot of heart to your designs if
14:05 - you are using uh a specific video
14:09 - on your website it gives so much more
14:11 - context
14:12 - like you can't you can't even say the
14:15 - same within the image you know
14:16 - images say a lot but if you have a video
14:18 - you know if
14:19 - if an image is worth you know a thousand
14:21 - words how much is a video worth
14:23 - i've thought about that before it's kind
14:25 - of funny anyways um
14:26 - let's see what people are saying here
14:28 - best youtube channel i like to watch
14:30 - in any time you guys motivated thank you
14:32 - dello i really appreciate that man
14:34 - wish i could share this with you guys
14:35 - but my comments apparently are not
14:36 - working
14:37 - psy says on splash unsplash is amazing
14:39 - man i did want to mention it and i did
14:42 - show it
14:43 - in in the beginning when i'm going over
14:45 - those resources
14:46 - that we're going to actually go through
14:47 - a little bit more right now
14:49 - but as of now i just kind of want to
14:50 - ease you guys into it and show you guys
14:52 - different areas of design and where you
14:55 - can use them on your websites
14:56 - so off the bat if you're designing i
14:58 - feel like it's going to be super
14:59 - important i've actually used this in
15:01 - another presentation
15:02 - but i feel like it's worth mentioning
15:04 - just because if you guys had these three
15:05 - tools right
15:06 - here if you're using mac i'm sorry if
15:08 - you are a windows user i
15:10 - actually was a windows user my whole
15:13 - life till up to
15:14 - two years ago or a year ago and i just
15:16 - fell in love with the mac echo system
15:18 - anyways
15:19 - you can use and find you know the
15:22 - the windows version for these tools i
15:25 - bet
15:25 - so please if you guys do see the windows
15:27 - versions please drop it in the comments
15:29 - below
15:29 - that's how i'll let's help out all of
15:31 - the windows users
15:33 - rocket is amazing because it lets you
15:36 - do emojis it lets you type in emoji let
15:39 - me see if i can show you guys here um
15:42 - so let's uh actually go here and if i
15:44 - type in
15:45 - maybe punch yep i'll do a punch boom
15:49 - so that in itself is rocket guys
15:52 - and that's why rocket is so amazing if
15:55 - you are
15:55 - if i'm doing lists sometimes i do you
15:58 - know emojis of check marks which help me
16:01 - make visual arrangements of my own notes
16:04 - and it's amazing
16:05 - two alfred is amazing too let me see if
16:08 - i can show you guys alfred is cool
16:10 - because
16:10 - you clicked instead of using spotlight
16:12 - on your computer you click
16:14 - you know command and space which is the
16:16 - hotkey that i used to open it
16:18 - but you see this little thing that i
16:20 - just opened up that i'm typing in
16:21 - it's a pretty much spotlight but it's a
16:23 - little bit smarter and the thing about
16:24 - this is you can go like
16:26 - fine and then you can screenshot and you
16:29 - get a
16:30 - screenshot you know so or you get any
16:32 - file that you want so
16:34 - you can even use it as a calculator so
16:35 - one two plus three equals 15 right so
16:39 - it's a really useful really resourceful
16:41 - yoink i don't know if you guys can see
16:42 - it right now
16:43 - but it's gonna be okay it's on the side
16:47 - of my screen right here and it's pretty
16:48 - much a clipboard where you can pretty
16:50 - much drag things
16:52 - from and and off of it you can also lock
16:55 - them so if you want to lock them and and
16:57 - maybe not erase them
16:58 - that's why you use yoink so if you're a
17:00 - designer man you're going to be
17:02 - working with a lot of you know jpegs a
17:04 - lot of files that you're gonna be moving
17:05 - around so many different desktops
17:07 - and these three tools are gonna make
17:09 - your life
17:10 - so much more simple if you get these
17:12 - three tools you're gonna save yourself
17:14 - so much time it's like
17:16 - investing a little bit of money because
17:17 - this is eight dollars a drink i believe
17:19 - is eight dollars
17:20 - alfred is free and rocket is free so you
17:22 - know eight bucks pretty much and then
17:24 - you can get the paid version
17:25 - if you do like them or if not just
17:27 - whatever just you know go on with your
17:28 - life
17:29 - let's see what else is going here alfred

23:28 - in my opinion one of the best ways for
23:30 - you to learn
23:30 - things is learning from the best if you
23:33 - can learn the style from a very
23:35 - successful person
23:36 - whether that's a style and design
23:38 - whether that's a style than maybe
23:39 - playing soccer

27:17 - do anything great
27:18 - okay you're kind of going to do the
27:20 - minimum work you're
27:22 - not going to be as creative as you

27:25 - not going to demand the thing that
27:29 - requires of you to either do
27:33 - a specific great job or a masterpiece
27:36 - matter
27:36 - artwork you know you want something that
27:39 - withstands
27:40 - the test of time by having a lot of
27:43 - passion for it so that's how you get
27:46 - inspiration from mobile patterns is a
27:47 - great
27:48 - tool figma you know figma we've
27:51 - mentioned it
27:51 - so much sigma is amazing guys thank you
27:55 - so much for you know actually using it
27:57 - i've heard a lot of people have a lot of
27:59 - great results from it just because
28:01 - figma does does give you the option for
28:03 - you to
28:04 - you know drag and drop certain objects
28:06 - and
28:07 - from there you drag and drop them and
28:09 - then you do whatever you want
28:11 - you know to them what's cool about it is
28:13 - that you can get the css code in the
28:15 - html code
28:16 - and a little bit of the javascript code
28:17 - as well and you can put it on your
28:19 - website so you don't have to
28:20 - you know code it from scratch you can
28:22 - actually do it with this specific tool
28:23 - and figma is amazing man there's
28:25 - so many different tutorials out there
28:27 - that i wish that i could just you know
28:28 - mention here
28:29 - specifically but i cannot so what's
28:32 - going to be cool is check out those
28:33 - tutorials of sigma i think it's going to
28:35 - be worth it if you guys are doing
28:36 - wireframing if you guys are doing
28:38 - you know design for diff different
28:40 - whether that's flows or websites or
28:42 - mobile apps and things of the sort
28:44 - figma is going to be amazing plus
28:46 - there's so much more now
28:47 - it's such a big company it went into you
28:50 - know even
28:50 - using svgs and different you know files
28:53 - that you can use for your design
28:54 - even icons things of the sort figma is
28:56 - that for you envision is gonna be
28:58 - amazing if you're doing wireframing and
29:00 - you're doing
29:01 - a little bit more design or mockups for
29:03 - apps and things of the sort
29:04 - i believe envision is adobe envision and
29:07 - it's
29:08 - it's great out there a lot of design
29:09 - school use it and it's
29:12 - it's you know people i've seen use it a
29:14 - lot for websites as well whether they
29:16 - use interactive websites and have a lot
29:17 - of animations
29:18 - i've seen them use within vision and
29:20 - it's it's a really cool
29:22 - thing material ui.com is actually or dot
29:26 - co
29:26 - i'm sorry is amazing i really really do
29:28 - like it
29:29 - just because i feel like you know you
29:32 - have to have
29:33 - certain resources for color color is so
29:36 - important if you're doing design guys
29:38 - especially if you're doing javascript if
29:40 - you're doing web development
29:41 - why first of all you know
29:44 - css is now so complex it started being a
29:48 - little bit more
29:48 - you know it was very basic it's like oh
29:50 - you don't know css man like what
29:52 - like you know you don't know html5 and
29:54 - css
29:55 - that's super easy that's not even
29:57 - programming you know it's a markup
29:58 - language or
29:59 - whatever you want to do or maybe that's
30:00 - html i'm and i'm getting confused
30:02 - anyways you know going into material
30:05 - material
30:06 - sorry um css there's um
30:09 - specific tools that you're gonna need
30:11 - for color css is color on websites most
30:13 - of the time
30:14 - and now like i said it's more complex
30:16 - than that so it's a great read
30:18 - tool that you can do for or use because
30:21 - one it tells you a little bit of um
30:24 - so sometimes it actually tells you news
30:27 - about what's going on with material ui
30:29 - and and
30:30 - because and the team
30:33 - anyways the development team all of
30:35 - these things but
30:36 - you know the actual cool thing about
30:39 - this is going to be the colors
30:40 - so it gives you the color and the hex
30:42 - code and it's already copied once you
30:44 - see it once you touch it you're going to
30:46 - copy it to your clipboard
30:47 - and now you can use it to design so all
30:49 - these are palettes that go together
30:51 - and already it saves you so much time
30:53 - okay so for development that's going to
30:55 - be
30:55 - dope and that's going to be just you
30:57 - know that was flat ui colors
30:59 - you can use metro colors all of these
31:01 - different types of colors
31:03 - and here is the blog that i was talking
31:05 - about i had actually seen it tell you a
31:07 - little bit more of news that
31:09 - have to do with the industry but i
31:10 - thought it was pretty cool
31:12 - you know here are different ways to use
31:14 - html colors and we can even see some
31:16 - unicode characters as well that you can
31:19 - use so all of these things are going to
31:20 - be very
31:21 - useful for you if you're doing any type
31:23 - of css and
31:25 - it's great that you know a tool like
31:27 - that that's why i wanted to add it for
31:28 - you guys
31:29 - thank you guys a lot for being here
31:31 - somebody said
31:32 - mohammed mohan it said this is really
31:34 - helpful thanks a lot thank you brother

31:38 - just like cp han thank you guys

31:43 - using
31:43 - currently it's actually a tv it's a huge
31:46 - tv man it's like a
31:47 - 60 inch tv i believe it's a little bit
31:50 - too much to be honest but
31:52 - we're getting used to it it's it's it's
31:55 - you know i cannot complain
31:56 - i definitely cannot complain but it's
31:58 - amazing and here is you know speaking
32:00 - about css
32:02 - things that i can share with you guys
32:03 - since it's so popular i did want to
32:05 - share you guys
32:06 - you guys do not have to start coding
32:09 - everything from scratch
32:10 - okay that's something that you're gonna
32:12 - have to realize you're not going to have
32:13 - to code everything from scratch and what
32:15 - you want to have to do is get
32:16 - the resources and get lists of things
32:19 - that you can reuse and reuse and reuse
32:21 - on your future designs so
32:23 - one you can develop more style one if
32:26 - you reuse
32:27 - specific things you're going to develop
32:28 - a style of design
32:30 - and i'm not saying limit yourself but
32:32 - maybe do limit what type of design or
32:35 - style you want to use for your designs
32:37 - so that you can have something that's
32:38 - kind of like concurrent throughout your
32:40 - design so that it doesn't look like
32:42 - this is a completely different person in
32:44 - a different design
32:46 - it's okay if it does all i'm saying is
32:47 - like if you kill it
32:49 - in design and then you make it so that
32:51 - it seems like the same person designing
32:53 - it it
32:53 - just it's just worth so much more in my
32:55 - opinion so
32:57 - you know going into css effects i think
32:59 - it's a great website because it gives
33:01 - you
33:01 - a little bit of you know you can copy
33:03 - different type of hover effects and
33:05 - effects
33:05 - like loading effects for css so
33:08 - click on the animation to copy the css
33:11 - so you click it and it's already copied
33:12 - to your clipboard
33:14 - it tells you right here on the bottom so
33:15 - all of these are different things that
33:17 - you can just literally copy and
33:18 - add it on your design and if you if you
33:21 - just have these
33:22 - tools guys if you have all of these
33:24 - tools that i'm showing you guys on your
33:25 - bookmark if you have it on your bookmark
33:27 - it's going to facilitate so much of your
33:29 - workflow and it's going to help you
33:31 - become so much more dangerous you know
33:33 - in design
33:34 - so you know i really want you guys to
33:36 - take it into heart and do start applying
33:38 - these things right now
33:40 - um so this is a great great thing i was
33:43 - actually
33:44 - not showing oh man i was not showing
33:46 - that what's this link for
33:48 - nice um thank you for sharing somebody
33:50 - says you guys are welcome
33:52 - i'm going to go over it really quick so
33:54 - css design is really cool because
33:56 - you can go into the website and just
33:58 - hover over and literally clip
33:59 - click it and it's going to copy it to
34:02 - your clipboard
34:02 - it's going to copy the css code so
34:05 - whether you're doing a button that's
34:06 - pulsating whether that's you know
34:08 - an animation for loading or an animation
34:11 - for downloading anything of the sort
34:12 - if you have this link right here on your
34:14 - bookmarks it's going to save you so much
34:15 - more time
34:16 - you can just go there and copy the css
34:18 - and not have to code it from scratch
34:20 - and if you ask me that's going to be
34:21 - amazing guys it's going to help you
34:23 - and serve you so much so you know you
34:26 - always want to have different resources
34:27 - like that that's going to save you time
34:28 - i wanted to add css and here
34:31 - we're going to add a little bit more of
34:32 - chrome extensions okay
34:34 - so chrome extensions are going to be
34:36 - really really useful
34:37 - because thank you thank you so much um
34:41 - nacho says wow this is really great i'll
34:44 - make my design
34:45 - much more consistent yeah man definitely
34:47 - it's it's
34:48 - really a thing you know that's why
34:51 - jackson pollock
34:52 - that's why jackson pollock has one of
34:54 - the most expensive paintings in the
34:55 - world or picasso or
34:57 - da vinci anybody everybody you know if
34:59 - you're talking about paintings in
35:00 - general
35:00 - artists in general david cho all these
35:02 - guys even though they do change styles
35:05 - you can always see a consistency in
35:06 - their styles in a way that's the same
35:08 - person it makes you so much more better
35:10 - to have a type of
35:12 - style or design style for yourself
35:14 - anyways chrome extensions are amazing
35:16 - because they make the workflows so much
35:18 - better and here in cleverprogrammer we
35:20 - are just addicted to making ourselves
35:22 - way more efficient and
35:24 - if you are not using fonts ninja and you
35:27 - are a designer
35:28 - man you are missing out on so much i
35:30 - remember we were at an actual we were
35:33 - at an event it was qazzy and aaron and i
35:36 - i believe yeah it was just us at an
35:38 - event this year in january
35:40 - in in tennessee nashville tennessee it
35:42 - was the funnel hacking
35:44 - live event that's actually where we met
35:45 - daniel the
35:48 - you know the the one of our developers
35:50 - that works
35:51 - used to work with rocket chips anyways
35:53 - we were there
35:54 - and we were having a presentation where
35:57 - one of the
35:58 - lead design what was it what was it
36:00 - called web design
36:02 - hackers it was web design hackers right
36:04 - i believe she was called she called
36:06 - herself a design hacker
36:07 - and this lady was an expert copying
36:11 - other people's website's styles so they
36:13 - wanted to see websites that actually
36:15 - converted you know that actually sold
36:17 - that actually that could get people to
36:19 - update their email and things of the
36:20 - sort and have
36:21 - good conversion rates this lady actually
36:23 - would dissect websites
36:25 - and and even measure the the actual
36:27 - margins and measure
36:29 - the colors measure you know the font
36:31 - size that they used
36:32 - so that they can make those websites
36:34 - actually convert better you know i
36:36 - didn't know
36:36 - about that but i learned you know this
36:39 - specific chrome extension from her
36:41 - so she uses fonts ninja i use fonts
36:43 - ninja really
36:44 - to check out fonts that i like on
36:46 - different websites
36:47 - and you would literally go to the chrome
36:50 - store and chrome extension store
36:52 - and download fonts ninja and you can use
36:54 - it
36:55 - and it's going to be really cool because
36:57 - you're going to get to know what
36:58 - everybody's using
36:59 - if you want to go into maybe tai lopez's
37:01 - website and see what fonts he's using
37:03 - you can do that
37:04 - you want to do that for nike and see
37:06 - what type of fonts are using i bet you

37:10 - you anyways
37:12 - you know it's uh i mean
37:16 - most fonts are used are are inspired by

37:37 - song says you know we are humans after
37:39 - all and
37:40 - if you are designing if you're doing
37:42 - something creative you want to have an
37:43 - expansive type of mind

39:03 - had research on them
39:05 - enough to show it to you guys eye color
39:07 - picker is amazing it's the same thing as

39:30 - really wanted to add it here because
39:32 - i actually learned this from nas as well

39:40 - and it tells you you put in you put in a
39:42 - username sorry a url
39:44 - and you type in the url and then it
39:46 - tells you all of the text stack
39:48 - that that company uses and you know
39:50 - literally everything whether it's made
39:52 - with wordpress or it's made with wix
39:54 - it's going to tell you exactly what it
39:56 - is made with wobblizer is cool
39:59 - because it's actually that same thing
40:01 - but on a chrome extension

44:48 - the design resources so icon finder is
44:51 - really dope man if you
44:52 - know about you know finding icons it's
44:54 - such a pain because sometimes
44:56 - you know you cannot for the love of god
44:59 - find the icon that you want
45:00 - just like you want it not to have a
45:02 - background but you it's impossible for
45:04 - you to find it without a background
45:06 - if you do find it without a background
45:07 - it's like super low quality
45:09 - and icon finder is a great way for you
45:11 - to spine like maybe
45:12 - computer and they have you know whether
45:14 - you want to pay for the monthly plan or
45:16 - you want to pay for

45:19 - icons eight
45:21 - is a really cool one too that we use
45:23 - here in the company
45:24 - it's actually man it's like you invest a
45:27 - little bit okay you have to invest a
45:28 - little bit
45:29 - because these things just save you so
45:31 - much time like i don't know how much
45:33 - time i've spent just looking for
45:35 - facebook logos google logos all of these
45:36 - things
45:37 - and icons eight is such a great way and
45:39 - you can even do it for free you just
45:40 - have to register with them i believe
45:42 - but you know we do pay for the monthly
45:44 - one with icons eight that's the one that
45:46 - we use for the company for whether
45:47 - that's you know a thumbnail whether
45:48 - that's a video we get it from icons
45:50 - eight it's a really really great one

46:25 - design in different
46:27 - whether that's a pattern of design or
46:29 - whether that's just the order of
46:31 - your development right so you know

50:56 - telling you what they do
50:58 - so they make me click away okay so let's
51:01 - look at that one
51:02 - ux collective so these are just these
51:05 - are you know collective
51:06 - blog posts to get for inspiration but
51:09 - anyways guys you know use
51:11 - this design resource that i'm showing
51:14 - you
51:14 - you know do use these tools do use
51:17 - something consistent on your arsenal so
51:19 - that you can start using on every
51:21 - project that you have
51:22 - you know share it with other people
51:23 - actually be part of these communities
51:25 - because
51:26 - these type of things guys is what's
51:27 - going to differentiate you from the
51:28 - other people that are working with you
51:30 - okay
51:30 - if you do have the resources and the
51:32 - tools not only can you use them but you
51:34 - can
51:34 - show other people how to use them okay
51:36 - and the thing about tools is that tools
51:38 - are such an important
51:39 - thing for your growth because
51:43 - tools is what puts us on top of the food
51:46 - chain
51:46 - pretty much you know we're not the
51:48 - strongest animal we're not
51:49 - i think we are the smartest one but
51:51 - we're not the strongest animal okay
51:52 - and the only thing that differentiates
51:54 - us from being eaten from maybe a lion is
51:56 - the fact that we can create
51:58 - houses and we can create tools that can
52:00 - actually battle a lion
52:01 - okay so tools is what's going to make
52:03 - you a great designer
52:05 - you are you cannot just stay to the
52:08 - staple
52:09 - tools of photoshop and building
52:11 - everything from scratch coding
52:12 - everything from scratch and designing
52:13 - everything from scratch
52:14 - that's incorrect now guys you know
52:16 - there's so many resources out there
52:18 - like i showed you guys this this one is
52:20 - one of the best ones like i showed you
52:23 - so many resources out there that you can
52:24 - use today so that you can make your
52:26 - design

52:30 - the more experience that you're gonna
52:32 - have the more better impact you're gonna
52:34 - have in the world and for yourself
52:36 - because everybody knows that when
52:38 - somebody does or you do a great
52:40 - job in your design you just feel like a
52:42 - hundred bucks
52:43 - okay and how about just investing a
52:46 - little bit of time into researching what
52:48 - are the tools that are going to get me
52:50 - to be that specific designer to get that
52:52 - specific job to finish the job to get
52:54 - the project to get the people together
52:56 - so that we can finish this project okay

Cleaned transcript:

you guys i want to talk about the top designing ui resources that you can use as a developer so i feel like tools and having a good toolkit you know around you if you're a developer is going to do you great justice in the world because ultimately i wrote about this in one of our emails actually we were talking about you know how each different artist uses different type of tools so if you are let's say a painter you use paint brushes and paint and if you are you know a construction worker you use maybe you know rulers and an actual just just in general tools right that help you make that job but us as you as ui ux designers and developers we need tools that help us build you know the websites that we need and things of the sort so that's why i started this list how's everybody doing checking out everybody in the chat looks amazing much love from the whole cp fam i missed you guys anyways let's let's continue let's go on so people might ask you know why resources why resources frankie feels like most of the videos that you do man you're going over resources and you're teaching us a bunch of things but do we really want to know those things i'd say yes you do want to know these things just because of the fact that if you do end up picking them up man it's going to save you so much time it's going to help you learn the right way because it's not only about learning it's about learning the right things you know and you got to make this sustainable and fun by the way so this is why we're going to go over in the beginning i wanted to save you guys a little bit of time thank you guys for being here you know the people that waited i know it's it's a live event it's the premiere thank you guys so much i know it's late in a lot of parts of the world but as dj khaled right now is showing you guys you know we're going to talk about the best resources first and he says we the best just like cause he's ringtone of every but if anybody saw the the vlogs that we put out but you know off the bat i wanted to start with the best in the list because you know i want to save you guys time and also i feel like this specific list it's a list uh it's a github repo made with resources for web developers but it was made by traversing media i saw it i'm like man i got to give you know recognition to this company this guy it's amazing guys if you do want to check it out i'm going to show it here i'll try to link it i'll try to link everything in the description but it's it's dope it's amazing you know just going over it a little bit it has a bunch of i'm gonna i'm actually gonna zoom in a little bit let me see okay i see that you guys can see a little bit better so it has everything right so if you want to know a little bit more about icons and get specific maybe svgs or you know even even different pngs here you can see it has a description of what it is and also the website so if you click on it it's gonna take you to the website so this is a huge library that traversing media put in their github repo and it's it's out there for you guys a lot of these um specific things that i'm about to mention in this video do appear here not everything i did want to mention things that i felt were very valuable and are used by our team by myself people that i know all of these things but off the bat i know if you guys go here you're going to save yourself so much more time you don't have to do all the research people have done it for you now just trust the process guys find the tools and learn how to use them so that's a great resource okay and another big big thing as i was doing my research of you know the best things that i can show you guys you know where you can learn where you can get inspiration where you can get you know all your whether those are you know photoshop files have svg files png files all these things that help you design a website or even just in general you know anything design wise you know i stumbled upon designresource.es and it's an amazing website that i actually want to dive deep into in this video and if i click on it it's kind of like traversing media's i i was really not showing sorry about that guys but if yeah if i want to go deeper into this it's kind of like traversing media's list but in this list specifically let's actually zoom in a little bit so you guys can see so in this list specifically you can see how it's actually very much like um the the presentation style of of traversing but it's a little bit prettier right you want to go and learn about what type of apps or tools you can use as a designer in design systems you'll go into you know here in design systems right if you want to go and check out mockup tools you go into mockup tools and you'll see animal mockup and then you click on the link it shows you that so people have already done all of this work for you guys now it's up to you to use it and i'm leaving it here in the beginning for you guys so unsplash it's a great one too i didn't mention it but i've used it a lot of times as well but this is it so this is the website you guys can follow it it's it's amazing and we'll go deeper into that as we go but as of now i did want to touch on cool things that i've stumbled upon myself and let me see who's here man amazing we got 45 likes right now appreciate the love guys i missed you know being here live with you guys i miss just talking to everybody that's out right there in the world wanting to learn about ui and design in general so people say i'm late what did i miss i just missed a few resources man you might want to go back and pick up those things because it might save you a lot of time let me see who else is here nice people from turkey nigeria logan hey frankie what's up brother what's up logan how you doing man uh hopefully man you can enjoy this i'm going over a fun a few fun things so going over you know specifically going into the laws of ux i feel like this is a great little thing to have because you know as you're starting a design sometimes you kind of just project you kind of want to project or just experiment what you want to try you know depending on what you feel looks nice and sometimes you even you haven't even tested you know the the actual practicality of your buttons you haven't resorted to heat maps or anything like that to tells you to tell you you know the history of a user's mapping of a user or anything like that i think it's amazing if you can go into a website that shows you a little bit more about details of use like this one specifically it's 20 loss of ux and this is law number one apparently you know aesthetic usability effect users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that's more usable amazing so it's two birds in one stone then you go into two and two is productivity source when a computer and its users interact at a pace less than 400 milliseconds that ensures that neither has to wait on the other so wow already it's giving you tweaks practical tweaks you can use on your design to make a specific change in interactability and if you want to go deeper you can go into every law i mean i think it's great as a reminder but i think it's also cool just to have around before you start to go into design and here i wanted to add this little gif because i thought it was funny man i love this movie um zootopia if anybody has seen it drop it in the comments below what is up guys how is everybody doing their front end is somewhat of a designer as well yep i agree man sound fantastic official just said i agree man it has a lot to do with design and ultimately design drips into any every other part of development as well so going into photography and video which is a huge part of just any website if you see any websites in general you can see an image here you can see you know specifically you know how the spacing looks the hover effects the shadows all of these things are part of effects part sorry part of design and in general graphic design and in general just part art in general you know if you're doing if you're doing sketches if you're doing all these things all these principles apply the shadows the hover effects all of these things right this is a great resource that i myself love we use it a lot here in the team it's called remove.bg and remove.bg is awesome because it saves you a lot of time instead of going into photoshop taking out a background what you're going to do is go into remove.bg and do i have it here i do have it here man so you literally literally just drag let's see let's drag um do i have any images here chilling it's because this one doesn't have a background let's see what is this okay for the sake of for the sake of it or the live i'm not gonna do it live but i mean you drag an image there and it pretty much takes off the background and that's amazing to save you time canva is a tool that i really really love i know it's been you know mentioned a lot so many people love canva so many people never actually a lot canvas a response is responsible for making so many people not learn photoshop because they're like oh man i don't even need photoshop i can use canva but canva is has been tested throughout time and people still use it it's a great resource if you want to use you know different let's go over it a little bit if you want to go into it and use maybe you know you can use it as photoshop you can use it as as you know social media posts inspiration you can use it as having layouts and templates for social media maybe you want to do you know inspirational posts for your channel your instagram something like that you can use it flyers you know presentations even for instagram stories so canva already saves you so much time and i feel like right now it's it's it's such a big time for for consistency and you know if you are a developer and you are a designer as well a lot of design in general right now has to do has needs a lot of consistency and i mean consistency in the term of you need massive distribution of your work you're always pumping out content you're always pumping account if you're a designer for a specific brand you might always be pumping out whether that's you know inspirational quotes or anything of the sort or also yo frankie is back good to see you man hey what's up arifat nice to nice to see you brother thank you for having me here but yeah what was i saying um yep consistency man and these tools that make it easier for you to finalize work are gonna make you the difference between you and the person working next to you they're gonna give you an edge so these tools are gonna keep you consistent and that's why i like it pixels is really nice because a lot of times when i'm editing a video or i'm you know whether i'm doing a landing page anything of that sort i always think about having a nice background for example here in this pixels website this is a screenshot of the pixels website and pixels pretty much is you know free stock images so you search any image right here let's actually do it because i put the link here let's put let's find i like dogs but let's let's look for cats boom you see all the images that you can use for free of cats different sizing all of these things right so pixels is really really nice you can also do the same thing with videos so it has 162 videos 3.23 k photos and you can use all of these videos as well so pixels is really nice i don't know what users is people i'm i guess okay users and so that's a great great resource i feel for example they're using a an actual image behind it and it's very common for you know website design right now to have images in the background or even videos on the background that's also very common you can see it on the top major websites right now the most popular ones at least we're at 85 likes people thank you guys for watching if you guys are here right now make sure you smash that like button because i'm giving you guys fire if you do use this in your daytoday life i assure you that your skills are just going to go up and up and up because not only are we showing you guys resources but the fun part about these resources is you can actually get inspiration you can actually extract and absorb all of these skills to your own skill set and actually apply them right so that's gonna improve your income improve your skills improve you as a person and the impact that you can do whether that's on a company or for yourself so moving forward we're going to talk about iso republic it's the same thing with images i'm not going to go into it it's pretty much the same thing as what was this pixels so you know it's the same type of concept it's it's another option for you guys because i do use both of them i like both of them i prefer pixels in my opinion but here is another example of it and cover i really really loved because i felt like this is one of the type of products that the workplace i'm sorry the market just requires let me take a little bit of water um i see you guys here alexander what's up man greetings i i love that guy he's always i don't know why he always um every time he sends something he has a plus sign in front of of his word i don't know if he's doing like a git committee or something but that's pretty funny anyways cover i feel like it's kind of a product that the market just required it somehow because so many websites use videos in their landing page you know i think cover has a video behind it yep so it has a video behind it and it's it's very common nowadays i think some nike websites have it like that a bunch of websites have it like that so let's see maybe vampires and you can look for stock footage there's actually none no no vampires if you want to use vampire footage probably don't don't use cover guys but okay so we're looking at this and you can just extract it for free and use it on your website cover is amazing it really does add a lot of depth a lot of heart to your designs if you are using uh a specific video on your website it gives so much more context like you can't you can't even say the same within the image you know images say a lot but if you have a video you know if if an image is worth you know a thousand words how much is a video worth i've thought about that before it's kind of funny anyways um let's see what people are saying here best youtube channel i like to watch in any time you guys motivated thank you dello i really appreciate that man wish i could share this with you guys but my comments apparently are not working psy says on splash unsplash is amazing man i did want to mention it and i did show it in in the beginning when i'm going over those resources that we're going to actually go through a little bit more right now but as of now i just kind of want to ease you guys into it and show you guys different areas of design and where you can use them on your websites so off the bat if you're designing i feel like it's going to be super important i've actually used this in another presentation but i feel like it's worth mentioning just because if you guys had these three tools right here if you're using mac i'm sorry if you are a windows user i actually was a windows user my whole life till up to two years ago or a year ago and i just fell in love with the mac echo system anyways you can use and find you know the the windows version for these tools i bet so please if you guys do see the windows versions please drop it in the comments below that's how i'll let's help out all of the windows users rocket is amazing because it lets you do emojis it lets you type in emoji let me see if i can show you guys here um so let's uh actually go here and if i type in maybe punch yep i'll do a punch boom so that in itself is rocket guys and that's why rocket is so amazing if you are if i'm doing lists sometimes i do you know emojis of check marks which help me make visual arrangements of my own notes and it's amazing two alfred is amazing too let me see if i can show you guys alfred is cool because you clicked instead of using spotlight on your computer you click you know command and space which is the hotkey that i used to open it but you see this little thing that i just opened up that i'm typing in it's a pretty much spotlight but it's a little bit smarter and the thing about this is you can go like fine and then you can screenshot and you get a screenshot you know so or you get any file that you want so you can even use it as a calculator so one two plus three equals 15 right so it's a really useful really resourceful yoink i don't know if you guys can see it right now but it's gonna be okay it's on the side of my screen right here and it's pretty much a clipboard where you can pretty much drag things from and and off of it you can also lock them so if you want to lock them and and maybe not erase them that's why you use yoink so if you're a designer man you're going to be working with a lot of you know jpegs a lot of files that you're gonna be moving around so many different desktops and these three tools are gonna make your life so much more simple if you get these three tools you're gonna save yourself so much time it's like investing a little bit of money because this is eight dollars a drink i believe is eight dollars alfred is free and rocket is free so you know eight bucks pretty much and then you can get the paid version if you do like them or if not just whatever just you know go on with your life let's see what else is going here alfred is cool for mac uh arifat says you can use hane for video windows oh nice hein that's awesome so there's a alfred alternative called hind for windows if you guys like that click the link below actually drop it in the comments below i mean um so other people can know so moving forward i feel like you know if you're a designer obviously you're going to be working with people and 114 likes guys oh my god that is amazing let's try to get that to 150 thank you guys so much for being here and actually enjoying this content i'm gonna try to make it really a little bit more fast pacey for you guys so you guys can digest it but anyways i do and i am excited to share that you know if you are working with a team you really do need droplet because dropper is an amazing tool that just let me actually see if it's here so it's an amazing tool that lets you share screenshots just like this so this is a screenshot and then you can pretty much make a little rectangle around it an arrow so that you can pinpoint exactly what you're trying to achieve with that screenshot so i don't know if if if we can test it out here but let me see okay so okay yep it did work so that's a screenshot and now what i'm doing is boom and and i'm going to be like yo make this is how fast i'm doing it make the text bigger so off the bat i can point to something specific in design and just say to make it bigger so now i save and copy url and if i want i just open it on a new tab right now so as you guys can see that's how fast it was and i can just pinpoint things in design that i want to change with other people so off the bat guys i did want to mention that if you are working with people you have to use things like dropper cool fonts there's so many things so many websites that people mention when they're talking about fonts fonts are super important guys if you are doing design specifically if you're doing websites you know try to keep it to two to three fonts per website please you know in no design you want to see 50 types of websites unless that's you know what you intended for but honestly you can spend your whole life looking for different font websites but to be honest guys most of your problems are gonna be solved if you just use google fonts it's good enough it's amazing okay so if you do you know wanna dive deeper into it there's so many different font websites the font uh you know freaking be font all of these type of websites that are really cool that i use myself too but google fonts is pretty much all you need so you know off the bat i didn't want to mention that get it off the way because it's a huge plus to know typography to know you know the science of lettering pretty much it makes your designs pop and make you seem more knowledgeable about design and actually makes you way more wellrounded as well so dribble i feel like it's an amazing resource that i wanted to add here because i've we've actually used dribble before here in this you know on our list because it's been such a great you know helper for a lot of our designers a lot of our people that follow us nice 132 likes people are actually paying attention you guys are amazing guys thank you so much yo bro i'm a developer you are showing really great resources thanks for your help man michael michael brazen thank you man i really do appreciate that that's you know what we do here in clever programmer man we try to make it simple for you guys so that you guys can you know earn more money get better skills and become better as people because if we become more wellrounded we can apply that to different parts of our lives whether that's fitness relationships people in general or just you know mastery of self pretty much guys dribble we're gonna go into it right here it's one of the top websites right now guys everybody's recommending dribble because it's so good excuse me so oh man i got a little bit um carried out carried away there but it's so amazing because everybody's actually you know look hot jar everybody's actually using dribble to get inspiration to get ui kids to now i'm seeing people are using it as as um a way to advertise themselves so different companies are using dribble they're making content on dribble so that you can actually see their companies wow so dribble you can get animations you can get branding ideas ui kits illustrations you know files all of these things and everything is top notch look at this it's amazing artwork it's curated very very well now i get a feeling like it's kind of turning into in pinterest and i did want to add pinterest to this list because i personally use it a lot i did i decided not to use it on this list specifically but pinterest is you know if i do want to get designed for whatever it is whether it's a thumbnail or whatever it's whether it's a video whether it's just in general pinterest is an amazing amazing tool but you know that was dribble everybody loves it that's what i wanted to share with you guys don't sleep on it lapa is amazing i actually learned about this specific tool from nas you know and if anybody knows not everybody knows nas what's up nas this guy is probably dancing upstairs but this is a great tool because lapa actually shows the top the best landing pages and literally the best landing pages in the world as inspiration sorry about that guys i feel like my my throat is a little bit um sore so give me one second i love those seconds of silence because i feel like we're just breathing together a little bit but you know going back to lappa lapa is amazing because they're top design pages and you get to get inspirations from them whether it's files you know just in general you know the the sizing of it in general layouts or the colors the palettes all of these things it's it just shows you you know how other companies are doing it and that's in my opinion one of the best ways for you to learn things is learning from the best if you can learn the style from a very successful person whether that's a style and design whether that's a style than maybe playing soccer anything in general you're just going to app up your skills way more because they did a lot of research so they're saving you so much more time just by copying them okay so that's something that i'd say lapa is great for that behance behance it's really really cool man i love it i love it it's a very it's kind of a it's one of those you know websites sorry 140 likes man oh man you guys are making me cough that's amazing holy cow thank you guys so much let's get it to 150 guys let's drop some love let's drop some likes and some comments you know we're all here to learn behance or behance is really cool because it's one of the pioneer websites that actually made a type of community where you know whether you're a developer or just graphic designer in general or just architectural you know designer whatever in general it's a great way to have a community to get inspiration for whether that's photoshop that lightroom presets you know whether that's illustrations and maybe files for adobe xd and and just in general you know how to you know wireframe ideas for after effects anything of that sort is going to be part of behance beyond apparently it's part of adobe i didn't know that i don't know they bought it apparently they bought it um very recently i didn't know that that's crazy i don't think it's always been um adobe's adobe's actual company that's amazing man but it reminds me a little bit of envato um behance is one of those that are one of the pioneers back in the in the day and i did want to give a mention to you know different mobile development type of resources because mobile development although it's not as much used as it used to be a little bit before you know people are not downloading as many apps as they used to now we're using a lot of more web applications 145 likes hey let's get it guys thank you guys so much we're about to go to 150 likes thanks so much gonna go into mobile development right now one of the cool things that i saw was actually patterns patterns is amazing because it shows you different ways and inspiration for you know how to actually design in mobile development see right sometimes you're kind of there's so many ideas that you want to do and hit on and it's like okay i want to make my design like this or like that here you can actually see what other companies are doing as well so one second okay cool so you know different colors different different devices here you can see the ipad or the iphone and these are going to be different for you know those specific things whether that's dark mode whether you want to look at how people are designing shopping carts whether they're you know designing sign up cards comment you know different what is it called comment forms or sections you know if you are designing a book in mobile if you are doing drawings all these things man this is amazing like this makes me want to make apps that's pretty freaking cool okay so even the search right shows you different the coloring of the search the smart searches things of the sword popovers amazing amazing so patterns is really cool because it gives you a really really really good idea 153 likes guys whoa we got there thank you guys so much that's amazing and yep patterns is gonna be good if you're gonna be using anything related to mobile so i feel like one of the biggest steps for you to start designing is the actual inspiration and if you're not inspired you're not gonna do anything great okay you're kind of going to do the minimum work you're not going to be as creative as you should be you are not going to demand the thing that requires of you to either do a specific great job or a masterpiece matter artwork you know you want something that withstands the test of time by having a lot of passion for it so that's how you get inspiration from mobile patterns is a great tool figma you know figma we've mentioned it so much sigma is amazing guys thank you so much for you know actually using it i've heard a lot of people have a lot of great results from it just because figma does does give you the option for you to you know drag and drop certain objects and from there you drag and drop them and then you do whatever you want you know to them what's cool about it is that you can get the css code in the html code and a little bit of the javascript code as well and you can put it on your website so you don't have to you know code it from scratch you can actually do it with this specific tool and figma is amazing man there's so many different tutorials out there that i wish that i could just you know mention here specifically but i cannot so what's going to be cool is check out those tutorials of sigma i think it's going to be worth it if you guys are doing wireframing if you guys are doing you know design for diff different whether that's flows or websites or mobile apps and things of the sort figma is going to be amazing plus there's so much more now it's such a big company it went into you know even using svgs and different you know files that you can use for your design even icons things of the sort figma is that for you envision is gonna be amazing if you're doing wireframing and you're doing a little bit more design or mockups for apps and things of the sort i believe envision is adobe envision and it's it's great out there a lot of design school use it and it's it's you know people i've seen use it a lot for websites as well whether they use interactive websites and have a lot of animations i've seen them use within vision and it's it's a really cool thing material ui.com is actually or dot co i'm sorry is amazing i really really do like it just because i feel like you know you have to have certain resources for color color is so important if you're doing design guys especially if you're doing javascript if you're doing web development why first of all you know css is now so complex it started being a little bit more you know it was very basic it's like oh you don't know css man like what like you know you don't know html5 and css that's super easy that's not even programming you know it's a markup language or whatever you want to do or maybe that's html i'm and i'm getting confused anyways you know going into material material sorry um css there's um specific tools that you're gonna need for color css is color on websites most of the time and now like i said it's more complex than that so it's a great read tool that you can do for or use because one it tells you a little bit of um so sometimes it actually tells you news about what's going on with material ui and and because and the team anyways the development team all of these things but you know the actual cool thing about this is going to be the colors so it gives you the color and the hex code and it's already copied once you see it once you touch it you're going to copy it to your clipboard and now you can use it to design so all these are palettes that go together and already it saves you so much time okay so for development that's going to be dope and that's going to be just you know that was flat ui colors you can use metro colors all of these different types of colors and here is the blog that i was talking about i had actually seen it tell you a little bit more of news that have to do with the industry but i thought it was pretty cool you know here are different ways to use html colors and we can even see some unicode characters as well that you can use so all of these things are going to be very useful for you if you're doing any type of css and it's great that you know a tool like that that's why i wanted to add it for you guys thank you guys a lot for being here somebody said mohammed mohan it said this is really helpful thanks a lot thank you brother really appreciate you sigma is the best just like cp han thank you guys so much man so far which monitor are you using currently it's actually a tv it's a huge tv man it's like a 60 inch tv i believe it's a little bit too much to be honest but we're getting used to it it's it's it's you know i cannot complain i definitely cannot complain but it's amazing and here is you know speaking about css things that i can share with you guys since it's so popular i did want to share you guys you guys do not have to start coding everything from scratch okay that's something that you're gonna have to realize you're not going to have to code everything from scratch and what you want to have to do is get the resources and get lists of things that you can reuse and reuse and reuse on your future designs so one you can develop more style one if you reuse specific things you're going to develop a style of design and i'm not saying limit yourself but maybe do limit what type of design or style you want to use for your designs so that you can have something that's kind of like concurrent throughout your design so that it doesn't look like this is a completely different person in a different design it's okay if it does all i'm saying is like if you kill it in design and then you make it so that it seems like the same person designing it it just it's just worth so much more in my opinion so you know going into css effects i think it's a great website because it gives you a little bit of you know you can copy different type of hover effects and effects like loading effects for css so click on the animation to copy the css so you click it and it's already copied to your clipboard it tells you right here on the bottom so all of these are different things that you can just literally copy and add it on your design and if you if you just have these tools guys if you have all of these tools that i'm showing you guys on your bookmark if you have it on your bookmark it's going to facilitate so much of your workflow and it's going to help you become so much more dangerous you know in design so you know i really want you guys to take it into heart and do start applying these things right now um so this is a great great thing i was actually not showing oh man i was not showing that what's this link for nice um thank you for sharing somebody says you guys are welcome i'm going to go over it really quick so css design is really cool because you can go into the website and just hover over and literally clip click it and it's going to copy it to your clipboard it's going to copy the css code so whether you're doing a button that's pulsating whether that's you know an animation for loading or an animation for downloading anything of the sort if you have this link right here on your bookmarks it's going to save you so much more time you can just go there and copy the css and not have to code it from scratch and if you ask me that's going to be amazing guys it's going to help you and serve you so much so you know you always want to have different resources like that that's going to save you time i wanted to add css and here we're going to add a little bit more of chrome extensions okay so chrome extensions are going to be really really useful because thank you thank you so much um nacho says wow this is really great i'll make my design much more consistent yeah man definitely it's it's really a thing you know that's why jackson pollock that's why jackson pollock has one of the most expensive paintings in the world or picasso or da vinci anybody everybody you know if you're talking about paintings in general artists in general david cho all these guys even though they do change styles you can always see a consistency in their styles in a way that's the same person it makes you so much more better to have a type of style or design style for yourself anyways chrome extensions are amazing because they make the workflows so much better and here in cleverprogrammer we are just addicted to making ourselves way more efficient and if you are not using fonts ninja and you are a designer man you are missing out on so much i remember we were at an actual we were at an event it was qazzy and aaron and i i believe yeah it was just us at an event this year in january in in tennessee nashville tennessee it was the funnel hacking live event that's actually where we met daniel the you know the the one of our developers that works used to work with rocket chips anyways we were there and we were having a presentation where one of the lead design what was it what was it called web design hackers it was web design hackers right i believe she was called she called herself a design hacker and this lady was an expert copying other people's website's styles so they wanted to see websites that actually converted you know that actually sold that actually that could get people to update their email and things of the sort and have good conversion rates this lady actually would dissect websites and and even measure the the actual margins and measure the colors measure you know the font size that they used so that they can make those websites actually convert better you know i didn't know about that but i learned you know this specific chrome extension from her so she uses fonts ninja i use fonts ninja really to check out fonts that i like on different websites and you would literally go to the chrome store and chrome extension store and download fonts ninja and you can use it and it's going to be really cool because you're going to get to know what everybody's using if you want to go into maybe tai lopez's website and see what fonts he's using you can do that you want to do that for nike and see what type of fonts are using i bet you they're using some for them some form of helvetica you know i bet you anyways you know it's uh i mean most fonts are used are are inspired by helvetica so it doesn't you know even make that much sense anyways fonts ninja is amazing guys do use the momentum is going to be amazing because let me see if i have it here in this computer yep so this is momentum you know if momentum is amazing because guys we are all humans after all like that daft punk song says you know we are humans after all and if you are designing if you're doing something creative you want to have an expansive type of mind you want to be in a room where you can actually think where you can feel good about yourself about you know coming up with ideas and be like okay yes this works this can be practical i can use this i can actually create stuff right now if you don't want to feel like you're just in a room locked up on your screen and just like looking at some code and things of the sort make it beautiful for you guys every time that you open up a tab on your chrome momentum is gonna give you first of all the time second of all and beautiful beautiful beautiful background image it just brings you inspiration man just having this in my opinion gives you so much mental health that it's already a huge huge way to start your day and just opening up you know different tabs i see here who jaffa ben kelly khilil says thank you so much for your effort you're making this seem easy and inspiring thank you so much man i really really do appreciate that love you guys so much it's crazy to think that you guys are all over the world and you know just whether that's night for you or day thank you guys for being here i really do appreciate it guys do take into consideration do take it into practice you know use these things that i'm showing you because they are going to make your life a little bit better i wouldn't put them in this list if it wasn't true and if i wouldn't have a little bit of experience with them or at least have had research on them enough to show it to you guys eye color picker is amazing it's the same thing as fun's ninja pretty much but with colors so sometimes you're on a website and you want to see the color of that website if you get eye color picker on the chrome extension store you're going to be able to get the colors that you want okay and the hex code for it so you can use it on your code and you can use it on photoshop or whatever wherever so wapalizer is really really cool i really wanted to add it here because i actually learned this from nas as well wapalizer is dope because i i used to use a website called built with i think it's called built with and it tells you you put in you put in a username sorry a url and you type in the url and then it tells you all of the text stack that that company uses and you know literally everything whether it's made with wordpress or it's made with wix it's going to tell you exactly what it is made with wobblizer is cool because it's actually that same thing but on a chrome extension and it's going to tell you the whole tech stack of a company and it's going to give you a really good way to know what they built it with if you want to copy or clone their website which i think it's amazing it's an amazing tool you know you like i said you have to learn from the best for you to get way way better and it's it's a it's an amazing way momentum has a weird bug which locks you out every now and then i'm not sure lorenzo says man i haven't even i haven't really i haven't really experienced that myself i've never had problems with that salute you bro for such a great information thank thank you so much boom boom games appreciate it man i searched but can't figure out which website um there were no websites these are just chrome extensions man so look for those colorzilla is cool for picking colors too yep i've seen colors as well so those are gonna be amazing ones and you know it's going to make it easier for you to just you know get the design ready man and off the bat guys like i said i could go hours and hours and hours just going over resources that you can use

amazing tool as well i guess these are the most popular mostly i haven't really even you know heard about it but we go into it what is this mostly the best design inspiration expertly created for you

because it sounds so weird i don't know how that might work okay giffy huh i think it just shows you i think it just shows you like inspiration okay i don't get it man i don't get it anyways let's go back to the design resources so icon finder is really dope man if you know about you know finding icons it's such a pain because sometimes you know you cannot for the love of god find the icon that you want just like you want it not to have a background but you it's impossible for you to find it without a background if you do find it without a background it's like super low quality and icon finder is a great way for you to spine like maybe computer and they have you know whether you want to pay for the monthly plan or you want to pay for specific icon packages you can do that icons eight is a really cool one too that we use here in the company it's actually man it's like you invest a little bit okay you have to invest a little bit because these things just save you so much time like i don't know how much time i've spent just looking for facebook logos google logos all of these things and icons eight is such a great way and you can even do it for free you just have to register with them i believe but you know we do pay for the monthly one with icons eight that's the one that we use for the company for whether that's you know a thumbnail whether that's a video we get it from icons eight it's a really really great one and you can see those all of these resources here in descendresource.es it's amazing unsplash is cool that's what people in the comments were mentioning it's one of those websites that lets you see photographs and you know it's cool because all of these are going to be the popular ones okay they're rated apparently by hearts right so 393 figma's winning is the favorite and this is another favorite so 208 rebels a favorite okay so what's cool about it is that you can actually see it in in categories so why is it cool to see it in categories it's cool because it can it can actually break down your design in different whether that's a pattern of design or whether that's just the order of your development right so you know you're thinking about icons that you're going to use it's like okay i'm going to use this tool and get all of these icons for my app or my web developer i'm sorry my web application or i'm going to go into all of these so that i can see you know inspiration for the design that i want to do right now and all these are going to be amazing okay and you want to go into jobs what is jobs actually actually looking for jobs as designers this is super cool so this website not only shows you how to you know have so many resources at your disposal but actually also lets you find jobs related to designing so that's amazing guys you guys can go into here and find jobs with designing and if you guys do find a job let me know in the comments below let us know if this actually works ripple jobs that's amazing guys um so going back into this learn design i bet so this is pretty much learning how to design so it actually gives you resources of how to learn as well like i said before in the beginning of the video it's not only about learning it's also about learning how to learn because i've mentioned this before not everybody learns the same way and people are different types of learners you know there's visual learners there's audio learners there are you know um people that learn by hearing there are people that learn by touching things of the sort so you know it's great to see everything put together in one place if you do want to go into you know right now i guess this is designing a podcast whether that's you know the tools for it um as in the thumbnails or maybe even the the actual layouts for the videos for you know social media all of these things prototyping tools envision like we were mentioning framer is another one proto pi is another one phase you know all of these are going to be part of prototyping if you're doing uh you know the mockup or just the beginning design of your app you want to see the flow of it all of these things they're great tools for prototyping let's see what's going on here icons eight is ridiculously good yeah man natural lorenzo i agree with that not um not true i can't say it really changed the whole game for us hey thanks frankie oh i found the things which i'm looking for sanjar hey man no worries yeah yeah thank you guys so much i'm a designer and a frontend developer no lauren so nice that's amazing man so this is cool guys i i would suggest going to this specific website that i'm showing you guys here design.resource s and start playing with it use it for yourself look almost everything that i mentioned is here and i got it from other lists and just my research and my experience in general but you know i cannot beat this website it's such a good website so many people i've seen so many videos of these resources specifically look lots of uix it's amazing man everything is here open peeps is cool because it's illustrations i saw it in in so many different lists so if you want to get illustrations for people or just use you know avatars and things like that you're gonna use open peeps sidebar the five best design links every day what is this so i don't understand what this is okay so it's like a sidebar newsletter double design okay cool and nicely done you know all of these things man adobe xs blush is another very very popular one that everybody is right now um recommending so illustration right now is a big big trend in web development and you know most of the sas companies that you see out there use illustrations it's crazy you know if you have a complex type of product you might want to use design that makes it very simple for people to want to use it and illustrations is a great way to do that and that's why you're going to want to get resources that have to do with illustration okay so it's not just like oh wow yeah illustration illustration resources no man think about why you're using these things okay so that's the way that you use the things is what makes the tools special humans is another one for um specific illustrations design calendar nice so you can design events things of the sort just click here amazing the best online design events so what is this okay you can you can pretty much do things like this or what i don't know if it's tool that's one thing about you know some websites manage they they're not specific enough and into telling you what they do so they make me click away okay so let's look at that one ux collective so these are just these are you know collective blog posts to get for inspiration but anyways guys you know use this design resource that i'm showing you you know do use these tools do use something consistent on your arsenal so that you can start using on every project that you have you know share it with other people actually be part of these communities because these type of things guys is what's going to differentiate you from the other people that are working with you okay if you do have the resources and the tools not only can you use them but you can show other people how to use them okay and the thing about tools is that tools are such an important thing for your growth because tools is what puts us on top of the food chain pretty much you know we're not the strongest animal we're not i think we are the smartest one but we're not the strongest animal okay and the only thing that differentiates us from being eaten from maybe a lion is the fact that we can create houses and we can create tools that can actually battle a lion okay so tools is what's going to make you a great designer you are you cannot just stay to the staple tools of photoshop and building everything from scratch coding everything from scratch and designing everything from scratch that's incorrect now guys you know there's so many resources out there like i showed you guys this this one is one of the best ones like i showed you so many resources out there that you can use today so that you can make your design better and the better that
