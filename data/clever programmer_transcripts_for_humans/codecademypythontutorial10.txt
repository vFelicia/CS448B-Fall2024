00:00 - what is up guys are you excited you know
00:05 - why cuz I'm excited we are on part one
00:11 - two three four five six seven eight nine
00:13 - ten we are on part ten you guys
00:18 - that means you've officially run out of
00:20 - fingers to represent what part we're on
00:22 - so I'm gonna have to get very creative
00:24 - in the next tutorial but these are the
00:27 - kind of problems I like to face alright
00:29 - how am I going to represent eleven if
00:31 - you guys got any ideas put put them down
00:34 - in the comments below
00:35 - other than that check it out we are at
00:38 - 39% we were working and talking about
00:41 - some spending a day at the supermarket
00:44 - you know and we figured out in some
00:47 - better ways how to use lists and
00:49 - dictionaries
00:49 - so let's continue on this thing we've
00:54 - completed this part 30% string looping
00:57 - so just like Python lists and dictionary
01:02 - loops you can loop through strings here
01:05 - is an example I'm going to take this
01:07 - paste it here for letter in code Academy
01:12 - I can say print letter I will run it and
01:17 - you can see that it's going to print out
01:19 - see the first time oh the next time d
01:21 - the next time and E and so on and so
01:24 - forth as you can see here what happens
01:27 - well the first time letter is C and so
01:31 - it prints out a C then the next time the
01:36 - letter is o and therefore letter is o
01:40 - here and it prints out an O to the
01:42 - screen which you see right below the C
01:45 - and it keeps going all the way to the Y
01:48 - it prints out the Y and then it
01:50 - understands automagically that we have
01:52 - reached the limit we have reached the
01:54 - last letter in the string and so
01:56 - therefore it stops got it
02:00 - awesome so that is looping in a string
02:05 - pretty simple pretty nice so they have
02:09 - this here word programming is fun
02:13 - enough for a letter and word which means
02:15 - that we loop through the string
02:16 - programming is fun if the letter is I we
02:19 - print out the letter so here we only
02:21 - print out something if the letter is I
02:24 - so let's check out how this bad boy
02:27 - works word programming is fun here we're
02:32 - using the variable word you can also put
02:35 - the string here but that would be a
02:37 - little stupid and the reason is because
02:39 - we've already defined what word is so no
02:42 - need to redefine it simply use the
02:45 - variable right over here and no need to
02:48 - paste this whole thing because when the
02:50 - program is running this automatically
02:52 - gets evaluated to programming is fun
02:54 - okay so for letter in word so for letter
02:59 - in this string over here how many
03:03 - letters is this string have I don't know
03:05 - a lot more than 10 probably so the first
03:10 - time letter is P the next time the
03:12 - letter is R the next time it's o G blah
03:14 - blah blah then at one point the letter
03:16 - is going to be that little space in
03:18 - between programming and the word is then
03:21 - it's going to be I and in its S and then
03:23 - the space in between the is and fun part
03:27 - and the letter is going to go all the
03:29 - way up to being an exclamation mark and
03:32 - then this loop is going to stop when do
03:34 - we print out a letter the only time we
03:37 - print out a letter is when the letter is
03:39 - equal to I you see that that's what this
03:42 - line 5 is so we loop over and over and
03:47 - over again if the letter is I we print
03:51 - it out and so that's it so here it's
03:54 - going to print out I and print out I so
03:56 - it's pretty simple okay and if we wanted
03:59 - to get fancy want to get real fancy I
04:02 - bet they're going to probably have you
04:04 - do something like this later on but I'm
04:07 - going to just show you this right now
04:09 - because you know we're cool like that so
04:12 - on line 5 I'm going to create a variable
04:15 - called counter or count or let's call it
04:18 - counter and what it's going to do is
04:20 - it's going to keep track of the count of
04:23 - how many times we've seen the letter I
04:25 - so here
04:26 - I'm going to say counter is equal to
04:28 - counter plus one so every time it loops
04:32 - and it sees the letter I it will go into
04:34 - this if block and everywhere it sees
04:38 - counter everywhere it sees an i or once
04:41 - it sees an i it's going to increment the
04:44 - variable counter by one right so
04:46 - basically this is saying the old counter
04:48 - or the original counter is now equal to
04:51 - what counter actually was plus one okay
04:55 - or rather the new counter this part here
04:58 - is going to equal to what counter was or
05:01 - is plus one so this is going to change
05:05 - this counters value and then at the end
05:07 - of the loop we can simply print counter
05:13 - okay or actually at the end of the loop
05:16 - right so I'm going to uninvent it and
05:18 - put it right there and let's see where
05:21 - do we have an error inconsistent use of
05:25 - tabs and spaces okay let's go here let's
05:29 - go here make everything consistent okay
05:33 - so why did that happen oh sorry this
05:38 - should actually be outside of the loop
05:40 - you should run it and you can see
05:43 - counter is now says it's two okay for
05:48 - every time it saw I cool we got ahead of
05:51 - ourselves there but no worries it's all
05:53 - good
05:55 - owning a store alright so now we own a
05:59 - store let's see what they want us to do
06:02 - in this example we create a new
06:04 - dictionary animal counts with three
06:06 - entries key and value three key bear
06:10 - value six key crow value to each of them
06:14 - separated by commas as you can see
06:18 - create a new dictionary called prices
06:20 - using the dictionary format or the
06:23 - squiggly format like the example above
06:25 - so we're going to create prices and it's
06:28 - going to have put these values in your
06:29 - prices dictionary I am a good programmer
06:32 - as a lazy programmer and so what I'm
06:34 - going to do is I'm going to simply paste
06:36 - all this in there so I don't have to
06:38 - type
06:38 - we can call it prices is equal to blah
06:42 - blah blah blah blah blah
06:43 - yeah and let's put this on you know just
06:50 - to make it nicer and easier read okay we
06:54 - can certainly put all of this on one
06:55 - line but this is how I like to do it so
06:58 - it's very easy to read what the
07:00 - dictionary prices is and that's how
07:02 - you'll see it a lot of times in written
07:04 - in professional software development
07:07 - code yeah this place is really expensive
07:09 - your supermarket subsidizes the zoo from
07:12 - the last course let's do this thing
07:15 - and start next lesson investing in stock
07:18 - create a stock dictionary with the
07:19 - values below so we're going to call this
07:23 - dictionaries no no sorry stock so
07:28 - effectively what we're doing is we have
07:31 - a dictionary called prices and that's
07:33 - keeping track of how much a banana is
07:35 - and how much an Apple is and how much in
07:37 - orange is but in stock what we're
07:40 - keeping track of us how many bananas do
07:43 - we have how many apples do we have and
07:45 - how many oranges do we have okay so one
07:48 - is keeping price of the dollar amount of
07:51 - the thing and the other one might be
07:52 - keeping track of the quantity amount
07:56 - okay
07:57 - so stock is equal to this guy here and
08:00 - I'm going to do it the same way
08:05 - separated by commas because if you don't
08:09 - separate by commas it's going to give
08:11 - you an error so we got prices in stock
08:14 - cool let's keep going
08:17 - keeping track of the produce so now
08:19 - they're getting fancy here a little bit
08:21 - we'll talk through this one really
08:23 - quickly okay so they're created a
08:26 - dictionary called once and then they
08:29 - create a dictionary called twice this is
08:31 - an example they're giving you okay we
08:33 - have a key a with the value one key B
08:36 - with the value two and in the dictionary
08:38 - twice basically you know you see a is 2
08:41 - B is 4 so what we're doing is for a key
08:45 - and once so for each key inside the
08:49 - dictionary
08:50 - once so the first time key is going to
08:54 - be a then the next time is going to be
08:56 - okay remember how we loop through just
09:00 - I'm going to print it out so you guys
09:01 - can see
09:03 - remember when we loop through a
09:05 - dictionary we access its keys every time
09:07 - so the first time key is a then the next
09:10 - time key is B so for a key and once
09:14 - print key right that's what we did but
09:16 - here's what they're showing us or here's
09:20 - the code that they have okay so we go
09:26 - and the keys in B now look in twice also
09:30 - notice that the keys are the same it's a
09:32 - and B so both of them have the same key
09:34 - now what we do here is once so we print
09:40 - out once and this % s is just a
09:45 - placeholder and you can put in anything
09:47 - that you want there so in our case we're
09:50 - accessing the value of the key so for
09:53 - example the first time we iterate over
09:56 - this we're going to get 4a in once one
10:00 - is going to get evaluated to you know
10:05 - that dictionary up there okay it's going
10:10 - to get evaluated to this thing which is
10:13 - the same thing as once so when we go
10:16 - through the first key then on line six
10:19 - what we're going to do is we're going to
10:22 - go to the dictionary once and access key
10:25 - key in our case is a the first time so
10:28 - once a should give you back one so now
10:34 - because of this place holder this part
10:36 - here translates to a one okay and then
10:41 - this part pretty much goes away and that
10:44 - gets printed out to the screen so you're
10:47 - going to get once : one then the next
10:52 - time we go and then the same thing is
10:55 - going to happen for the twice part of it
10:57 - okay so twice key it's going to pass an
11:00 - a for it
11:01 - this gets evaluated to two and four
11:06 - twice we're going to have twice is two
11:07 - right there okay then if we go all the
11:12 - way back the second time in the loop of
11:17 - the dictionary once we'll access the key
11:20 - B then this will put be right here for
11:24 - the dictionary once which will give you
11:26 - back the value to it will replace
11:29 - because of the placeholder this would -
11:31 - this part goes away we'll print that out
11:34 - it'll go into the twice key put B right
11:38 - here this part because we're doing
11:41 - dictionary key is going to give you back
11:44 - the value which is going to be four it's
11:47 - going to replace this with the four this
11:49 - part is going to go away and it's going
11:50 - to print that out so now hopefully you
11:53 - have a little bit of understanding of
11:55 - what's going on let's run it here and
11:57 - you can see once one twice - then once -
12:00 - twice for okay again your examples are
12:05 - weird right very force they could do
12:09 - much better than that
12:10 - but the choose not to so they can
12:12 - confuse you anyways
12:15 - let's keep going maybe if I get endorsed
12:18 - by Codecademy and I'm talking all these
12:20 - bad things about them sometime you know
12:21 - they might be like oh we don't want you
12:23 - to be endorsed by us in the above
12:26 - example we create two dictionaries once
12:29 - and twice and now because we met we know
12:32 - that they have the same keys we can loop
12:33 - through one dictionary and print values
12:35 - from both once and twice so the trick
12:38 - here is notice that they both have the
12:40 - same key so at the same loop going
12:42 - through really one dictionary once they
12:45 - know that the both have the same key so
12:46 - they can print both of their stuff out
12:48 - so the idea that they want you to take
12:52 - away from this is notice that the keys
12:54 - in prices and stock are the same right
12:57 - keys and prices and stock are the same
13:00 - so you can say four key in prices
13:06 - print prices so your dictionary key it's
13:12 - going to give you back the value and
13:14 - print prices or I'm sorry stock
13:19 - dictionary stock passing the same keys
13:22 - and you're going to get back to
13:23 - corresponding values so the first time
13:26 - you know if it's the key is banana for
13:28 - prices is going to print out for and for
13:30 - stock it's going to print out six okay
13:34 - but the first time the key was pair so
13:36 - it printed out at three and pair stock
13:39 - is fifteen so on and so forth okay you
13:42 - can see all of that okay let's continue
13:44 - moving on
13:45 - make sure you have exactly three print
13:48 - statements okay so we have to actually
13:49 - do something loop through so we wrote
13:54 - the loop I'm going to copy that loop
13:55 - right well I don't have to it's more
14:01 - we're copying and Equuleus wrote it loop
14:03 - through each key in prices so we done
14:05 - that four key in prices just by itself
14:07 - does that like the example above for
14:10 - each key print out the key along with
14:12 - this price and stock information print
14:14 - the answer in the following format so it
14:16 - should actually look like this so here's
14:18 - what I'm going to say print right we
14:23 - want to print out what key it is now
14:25 - underneath the key we want to print
14:28 - price right it should say price every
14:31 - time that's why I'm putting it in a
14:33 - string this is not a variable thing
14:34 - variable means something that changes
14:36 - this is a hard-coded thing and it should
14:39 - set price just like this with a colon
14:41 - after it now the next part of it is
14:43 - variable so I'm going to put that
14:44 - percent s as a placeholder I'm going to
14:48 - put a percent here and I'm going to say
14:52 - give me the value here from the
14:56 - dictionary prices prices pass in my key
15:00 - and effectively for the next one I'm
15:04 - going to do pretty much the same thing
15:05 - except the dictionary is going to be
15:07 - changed is going to be stock and I'm
15:10 - going to say stock right over here
15:13 - and if I save and submit this should
15:15 - work just fine
15:16 - so as you can see we have an orange in
15:20 - our shop and the price of that orange is
15:23 - one dollar and fifty cents and in stock
15:26 - we have thirty two oranges left as you
15:29 - can see in our next one price pair we
15:33 - have price three and stock fifteen so on
15:35 - and four so forth
15:37 - so hopefully you get the idea let's keep
15:39 - rolling something of value of paperwork
15:43 - interpret let's record the total value
15:46 - of your inventory it's nice to know what
15:48 - we're worth okay so we're going to
15:54 - create a variable called total and set
15:56 - it to zero all right total is equal to
15:59 - zero loop through the prices
16:02 - dictionaries for a key in prices for
16:07 - each key in prices multiply the number
16:09 - and prices by the number in stock so
16:12 - what we're doing is we're like let's say
16:15 - we have orange is 32 so we are going to
16:19 - be multiplying orange thirty-two with
16:22 - orange 1.5 which means we're multiplying
16:25 - thirty-two oranges with their price one
16:28 - dollar fifty cents that will tell you
16:31 - how much all your oranges are worth so
16:34 - 32 times 1.5 that gives you 48 which
16:37 - means that if you sold all your oranges
16:41 - you would have 48 dollars left ok you
16:44 - could do the same thing with you have to
16:46 - do the same thing with pears and bananas
16:48 - so you're finding what all other values
16:50 - are pretty much so for each key in
16:53 - prices multiply the number in prices by
16:56 - the number in stock okay so what I'm
17:00 - going to say and we have to add it to
17:05 - total okay print that value into the
17:07 - console on the Edit tools okay
17:08 - so prices
17:14 - key multiplied by the stock key and then
17:19 - I'm going to say total actually there's
17:24 - a smarter way to do this I'm going to
17:27 - call a create a variable called value
17:29 - and I'm going to set print value and I'm
17:32 - going to say total is equal to what
17:34 - taught so new total is equal to a total
17:36 - was which initially will be zero plus a
17:40 - value okay so for example if our key is
17:49 - banana we would have banana banana right
17:56 - here then we would go to this part and
17:58 - we would look up the dictionary and the
18:01 - dictionary would look up banana we'd go
18:04 - all the line two
18:05 - we'll see that the prices is four so
18:07 - this part is going to get evaluated to
18:08 - four we will look up banana in the stock
18:13 - dictionary we would see that the
18:15 - quantity of that is six so we would get
18:17 - 4 times 6 4 times 6 is 24
18:21 - this part a values to 24 now with set
18:24 - print 24 and then it would say total is
18:27 - equal to 0 plus 24 which means total is
18:31 - equal to 24 which means that this total
18:34 - is also not equal to 24 this is how
18:39 - incrementing works now next time it's
18:41 - looping through and let's say it is
18:43 - Apple now now in okay we got to go back
18:49 - just so I have that code the total was
18:53 - at 24 let's remember that now we're
18:55 - going to go again and let's say this
18:57 - time it's Apple and prices we got app
19:01 - will look up Apple in prices and we'll
19:03 - look up Apple in stock apples price is
19:09 - $2 or whatever currency you're in and
19:13 - then Apple stock is 0 2 times 0 gives
19:17 - you 0 value is 0 and total is equal to
19:22 - total plus value this total is 24
19:25 - is zero and so this effectively stays at
19:30 - 24 and then we loop again okay so I
19:36 - think you get the idea and I will move
19:39 - on from this part now okay and then
19:43 - finally outside your loop print total
19:46 - okay so outside the loop right if we
19:49 - keep it indented underneath the for loop
19:51 - then it's going to keep looping over and
19:53 - over again but we want to print out
19:55 - total only one so we're going to keep it
19:57 - outside of the loop here you can see 40
19:59 - a 45 24 and all of that stuff and then
20:02 - total you see is 117 dollars right
20:07 - that's the total value of your store
20:09 - okay not a very expensive not a lot of
20:15 - money are making there so on fruit but
20:16 - hey better than nothing shopping at the
20:20 - market great work now we're going to
20:22 - take a step back from a management side
20:24 - and take a look through the eyes of the
20:26 - shopper in order for customers to order
20:29 - online we're going to have to make a
20:31 - consumer interface don't worry it's
20:33 - easier than it sounds so what we are
20:37 - going to be doing is we're going to make
20:39 - a list called groceries with the values
20:41 - banana orange and apple okay that's cool
20:46 - because we remember I was creating a lot
20:48 - of stuff with groceries earlier and I
20:51 - didn't even know about that they're
20:53 - going to be teaching you this so this is
20:54 - exciting
20:55 - everything that I was foreshadowing is
20:58 - coming into play somehow and I think
21:02 - we're going to keep this to be the last
21:03 - video of this this is we're going to
21:06 - keep this section to be the last section
21:08 - of this tutorial and then we'll continue
21:10 - afterward after that why don't we get
21:13 - tick marks for any of these that's weird
21:18 - okay so save and submit code gradually
21:24 - let's do one more part because that was
21:26 - very easy took no time at all oh now
21:30 - they're getting into some big stuff
21:32 - right here so what they're doing here is
21:35 - they defined a function whoops so
21:42 - they're doing is defined a function
21:43 - called sum which takes in as input up
21:46 - I'm assuming it says numbers here so I'm
21:49 - assuming it takes in a list of numbers
21:50 - and then it keeps a counter variable
21:55 - like total right there then it goes for
21:58 - each number in the list numbers are
22:03 - increment total by that number increment
22:08 - this is just like saying total plus
22:10 - number so increment total by that number
22:13 - and then return total so all it does is
22:16 - it goes one then it goes plus two so now
22:19 - total will be at three then it will see
22:24 - that we have five so we'll do 3 plus 5
22:27 - we'll get back eight then it'll say
22:31 - eight plus ten right here we'll get back
22:34 - 18 and then it will say that plus 13 and
22:37 - we'll get back 31 and then I'll return
22:40 - 31 and this part will print out 31 and
22:44 - then we're good to go so let's now
22:48 - actually tangibly look at what might
22:50 - happen if we pass then this list and so
22:53 - here we define this function right when
22:55 - you define a function nothing happens
22:57 - right you just define it so if I print
22:59 - out nothing is going to get print out
23:00 - you have to call your function it's just
23:03 - like saying if I defined a variable V is
23:05 - equal to 5 well that's not going to do
23:07 - anything in and of itself I have to say
23:11 - a print V or whatever I have to call V
23:14 - and then it shows me the value of what V
23:16 - is so just like that we have to call our
23:19 - function but our function is dependent
23:21 - on a list of numbers so here we're
23:25 - creating a list N and we're giving it
23:28 - numbers 1 2 5 10 and
23:30 - 13 so we're calling our functions some
23:33 - and we're passing in this list over here
23:37 - so what's effectively happening is it
23:39 - comes to this here it puts in that list
23:42 - now it goes boom I've initialized total
23:45 - to zero let's get going this numbers is
23:48 - 1 2 5 10 13 the first time we loop
23:52 - through number is 1 so total gets
23:55 - incremented this is a shorthand for the
23:57 - incremental notation it gets incremented
24:01 - by 1 so effectively this total here
24:05 - becomes 1 then the loop goes again and
24:08 - it goes okay now I'm - so what I'm going
24:12 - to do is that so this part here says
24:16 - number right so now this part is 2 and
24:21 - so total gets incremented by 2 and we
24:24 - get 3 2 here then it becomes 5 it gets
24:27 - implemented by 5 this becomes 8 and once
24:31 - all that happens it's finally 13 or
24:35 - sorry this part is finally 13 total gets
24:39 - incremented by 13 so at that point
24:42 - whatever it is something like 31 and you
24:45 - return 31 so what you've done is you've
24:47 - taken this whole list and add it all up
24:51 - and that's how you return 31 makes sense
24:54 - if you do 1 plus 2 plus 5 plus 10 just
24:57 - to double-check you indeed get 31 and so
25:00 - will your function so let's call our
25:03 - function now with the given list and
25:05 - let's see if it gives us back 31 print
25:09 - Python 3 parent is a function you have
25:12 - to put parentheses after it and we
25:14 - indeed do get 31 so define a function
25:18 - anytime this I define a function where a
25:20 - d EF compute bill takes one argument
25:24 - food as input in the function create a
25:27 - variable total with initial values 0 for
25:30 - each item in the list for each every
25:32 - time I here for each I'm writing a for
25:35 - loop for each item in the list so item
25:38 - in food or in shopping list
25:42 - soon um right this variable right here
25:51 - shopping list that's where I'm getting
25:52 - that from and item is just a arbitrary
25:54 - variable you can call it whatever you
25:55 - want I'm gonna call it item and after
25:58 - put a colon and hit enter after that
26:00 - don't forget at the price of the item to
26:03 - total so I'm going to say I'm going to
26:06 - get the user prices so I'm going to take
26:09 - the variable total and I'm going to
26:12 - increment it using the shorthand
26:14 - notation and to get the price of that
26:18 - item
26:18 - so here banana orange and apple well
26:20 - which dictionary am I going to look up
26:22 - the pricing of that item in stock no I'm
26:24 - going to look it up in prices so I'm
26:27 - going to call the prices dictionary pass
26:30 - in that item as a key and I'm going to
26:34 - be incrementing total by that and then
26:37 - it says a return total so after we are
26:42 - done with that it's going to return
26:44 - total so the first time is going to be
26:46 - banana banana and then it's going to
26:50 - look up a banana in the dictionary and
26:53 - it's going to increment this by 4 then
26:56 - you look up orange it's going to look
27:01 - for it's going to be orange and the
27:02 - shopping list it's going to come down
27:04 - here it's going to look up orange in the
27:07 - prices that whole part is going to get
27:09 - evaluated to 1.5 this is going to get
27:14 - incremented by one point five so this is
27:17 - now going to be you know what was it for
27:20 - so now it's going to be five point five
27:23 - and it's going to maybe return that
27:25 - right or add Apple and then return it um
27:30 - okay cool so let's take a look at how
27:34 - this works compute bill Apple return
27:39 - something incorrect hmm let's see what
27:42 - we did wrong note that your function
27:45 - should work for any food list let's see
27:49 - why it returned a wrong answer
27:52 - I have total here I loop through I use
27:58 - the key to access that item I increment
28:00 - total by that and then once the loop is
28:02 - over
28:03 - I return the total
28:11 - so once it passed it Apple for some
28:14 - reason it returned oh I see I'm being
28:24 - silly I should not be using okay so this
28:27 - is a common mistake that beginners made
28:29 - and apparently I've made that's what
28:31 - happens when you're live coding you make
28:33 - a lot of silly mistakes but it's okay
28:36 - because it's part of a learning
28:37 - experience what I forgot to notice that
28:39 - it's a function so we're taking in food
28:42 - as a parameter so I'm not going to hard
28:45 - code and put this shopping list on line
28:47 - one from line one I should actually put
28:50 - food here this way you don't have to
28:54 - give me this exact exact list you could
28:56 - be giving you a different list for
28:58 - example if you gave me a list like this
29:01 - my code should work fine but if you also
29:04 - gave me a list with just one item Apple
29:07 - the code should also work fine
29:10 - but in this case shopping list if you
29:13 - use this function compute Bill and you
29:18 - try to pass in a list with like let's
29:21 - say just Apple what's going to happen is
29:25 - that is going to still be using the
29:26 - shopping list and not what you actually
29:28 - gave me as input so silly little mistake
29:33 - there let's fix that with food and that
29:37 - should be now golden okay perfect this
29:41 - this is it for this video guys please if

Cleaned transcript:

what is up guys are you excited you know why cuz I'm excited we are on part one two three four five six seven eight nine ten we are on part ten you guys that means you've officially run out of fingers to represent what part we're on so I'm gonna have to get very creative in the next tutorial but these are the kind of problems I like to face alright how am I going to represent eleven if you guys got any ideas put put them down in the comments below other than that check it out we are at 39% we were working and talking about some spending a day at the supermarket you know and we figured out in some better ways how to use lists and dictionaries so let's continue on this thing we've completed this part 30% string looping so just like Python lists and dictionary loops you can loop through strings here is an example I'm going to take this paste it here for letter in code Academy I can say print letter I will run it and you can see that it's going to print out see the first time oh the next time d the next time and E and so on and so forth as you can see here what happens well the first time letter is C and so it prints out a C then the next time the letter is o and therefore letter is o here and it prints out an O to the screen which you see right below the C and it keeps going all the way to the Y it prints out the Y and then it understands automagically that we have reached the limit we have reached the last letter in the string and so therefore it stops got it awesome so that is looping in a string pretty simple pretty nice so they have this here word programming is fun enough for a letter and word which means that we loop through the string programming is fun if the letter is I we print out the letter so here we only print out something if the letter is I so let's check out how this bad boy works word programming is fun here we're using the variable word you can also put the string here but that would be a little stupid and the reason is because we've already defined what word is so no need to redefine it simply use the variable right over here and no need to paste this whole thing because when the program is running this automatically gets evaluated to programming is fun okay so for letter in word so for letter in this string over here how many letters is this string have I don't know a lot more than 10 probably so the first time letter is P the next time the letter is R the next time it's o G blah blah blah then at one point the letter is going to be that little space in between programming and the word is then it's going to be I and in its S and then the space in between the is and fun part and the letter is going to go all the way up to being an exclamation mark and then this loop is going to stop when do we print out a letter the only time we print out a letter is when the letter is equal to I you see that that's what this line 5 is so we loop over and over and over again if the letter is I we print it out and so that's it so here it's going to print out I and print out I so it's pretty simple okay and if we wanted to get fancy want to get real fancy I bet they're going to probably have you do something like this later on but I'm going to just show you this right now because you know we're cool like that so on line 5 I'm going to create a variable called counter or count or let's call it counter and what it's going to do is it's going to keep track of the count of how many times we've seen the letter I so here I'm going to say counter is equal to counter plus one so every time it loops and it sees the letter I it will go into this if block and everywhere it sees counter everywhere it sees an i or once it sees an i it's going to increment the variable counter by one right so basically this is saying the old counter or the original counter is now equal to what counter actually was plus one okay or rather the new counter this part here is going to equal to what counter was or is plus one so this is going to change this counters value and then at the end of the loop we can simply print counter okay or actually at the end of the loop right so I'm going to uninvent it and put it right there and let's see where do we have an error inconsistent use of tabs and spaces okay let's go here let's go here make everything consistent okay so why did that happen oh sorry this should actually be outside of the loop you should run it and you can see counter is now says it's two okay for every time it saw I cool we got ahead of ourselves there but no worries it's all good owning a store alright so now we own a store let's see what they want us to do in this example we create a new dictionary animal counts with three entries key and value three key bear value six key crow value to each of them separated by commas as you can see create a new dictionary called prices using the dictionary format or the squiggly format like the example above so we're going to create prices and it's going to have put these values in your prices dictionary I am a good programmer as a lazy programmer and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to simply paste all this in there so I don't have to type we can call it prices is equal to blah blah blah blah blah blah yeah and let's put this on you know just to make it nicer and easier read okay we can certainly put all of this on one line but this is how I like to do it so it's very easy to read what the dictionary prices is and that's how you'll see it a lot of times in written in professional software development code yeah this place is really expensive your supermarket subsidizes the zoo from the last course let's do this thing and start next lesson investing in stock create a stock dictionary with the values below so we're going to call this dictionaries no no sorry stock so effectively what we're doing is we have a dictionary called prices and that's keeping track of how much a banana is and how much an Apple is and how much in orange is but in stock what we're keeping track of us how many bananas do we have how many apples do we have and how many oranges do we have okay so one is keeping price of the dollar amount of the thing and the other one might be keeping track of the quantity amount okay so stock is equal to this guy here and I'm going to do it the same way separated by commas because if you don't separate by commas it's going to give you an error so we got prices in stock cool let's keep going keeping track of the produce so now they're getting fancy here a little bit we'll talk through this one really quickly okay so they're created a dictionary called once and then they create a dictionary called twice this is an example they're giving you okay we have a key a with the value one key B with the value two and in the dictionary twice basically you know you see a is 2 B is 4 so what we're doing is for a key and once so for each key inside the dictionary once so the first time key is going to be a then the next time is going to be okay remember how we loop through just I'm going to print it out so you guys can see remember when we loop through a dictionary we access its keys every time so the first time key is a then the next time key is B so for a key and once print key right that's what we did but here's what they're showing us or here's the code that they have okay so we go and the keys in B now look in twice also notice that the keys are the same it's a and B so both of them have the same key now what we do here is once so we print out once and this % s is just a placeholder and you can put in anything that you want there so in our case we're accessing the value of the key so for example the first time we iterate over this we're going to get 4a in once one is going to get evaluated to you know that dictionary up there okay it's going to get evaluated to this thing which is the same thing as once so when we go through the first key then on line six what we're going to do is we're going to go to the dictionary once and access key key in our case is a the first time so once a should give you back one so now because of this place holder this part here translates to a one okay and then this part pretty much goes away and that gets printed out to the screen so you're going to get once one then the next time we go and then the same thing is going to happen for the twice part of it okay so twice key it's going to pass an a for it this gets evaluated to two and four twice we're going to have twice is two right there okay then if we go all the way back the second time in the loop of the dictionary once we'll access the key B then this will put be right here for the dictionary once which will give you back the value to it will replace because of the placeholder this would this part goes away we'll print that out it'll go into the twice key put B right here this part because we're doing dictionary key is going to give you back the value which is going to be four it's going to replace this with the four this part is going to go away and it's going to print that out so now hopefully you have a little bit of understanding of what's going on let's run it here and you can see once one twice then once twice for okay again your examples are weird right very force they could do much better than that but the choose not to so they can confuse you anyways let's keep going maybe if I get endorsed by Codecademy and I'm talking all these bad things about them sometime you know they might be like oh we don't want you to be endorsed by us in the above example we create two dictionaries once and twice and now because we met we know that they have the same keys we can loop through one dictionary and print values from both once and twice so the trick here is notice that they both have the same key so at the same loop going through really one dictionary once they know that the both have the same key so they can print both of their stuff out so the idea that they want you to take away from this is notice that the keys in prices and stock are the same right keys and prices and stock are the same so you can say four key in prices print prices so your dictionary key it's going to give you back the value and print prices or I'm sorry stock dictionary stock passing the same keys and you're going to get back to corresponding values so the first time you know if it's the key is banana for prices is going to print out for and for stock it's going to print out six okay but the first time the key was pair so it printed out at three and pair stock is fifteen so on and so forth okay you can see all of that okay let's continue moving on make sure you have exactly three print statements okay so we have to actually do something loop through so we wrote the loop I'm going to copy that loop right well I don't have to it's more we're copying and Equuleus wrote it loop through each key in prices so we done that four key in prices just by itself does that like the example above for each key print out the key along with this price and stock information print the answer in the following format so it should actually look like this so here's what I'm going to say print right we want to print out what key it is now underneath the key we want to print price right it should say price every time that's why I'm putting it in a string this is not a variable thing variable means something that changes this is a hardcoded thing and it should set price just like this with a colon after it now the next part of it is variable so I'm going to put that percent s as a placeholder I'm going to put a percent here and I'm going to say give me the value here from the dictionary prices prices pass in my key and effectively for the next one I'm going to do pretty much the same thing except the dictionary is going to be changed is going to be stock and I'm going to say stock right over here and if I save and submit this should work just fine so as you can see we have an orange in our shop and the price of that orange is one dollar and fifty cents and in stock we have thirty two oranges left as you can see in our next one price pair we have price three and stock fifteen so on and four so forth so hopefully you get the idea let's keep rolling something of value of paperwork interpret let's record the total value of your inventory it's nice to know what we're worth okay so we're going to create a variable called total and set it to zero all right total is equal to zero loop through the prices dictionaries for a key in prices for each key in prices multiply the number and prices by the number in stock so what we're doing is we're like let's say we have orange is 32 so we are going to be multiplying orange thirtytwo with orange 1.5 which means we're multiplying thirtytwo oranges with their price one dollar fifty cents that will tell you how much all your oranges are worth so 32 times 1.5 that gives you 48 which means that if you sold all your oranges you would have 48 dollars left ok you could do the same thing with you have to do the same thing with pears and bananas so you're finding what all other values are pretty much so for each key in prices multiply the number in prices by the number in stock okay so what I'm going to say and we have to add it to total okay print that value into the console on the Edit tools okay so prices key multiplied by the stock key and then I'm going to say total actually there's a smarter way to do this I'm going to call a create a variable called value and I'm going to set print value and I'm going to say total is equal to what taught so new total is equal to a total was which initially will be zero plus a value okay so for example if our key is banana we would have banana banana right here then we would go to this part and we would look up the dictionary and the dictionary would look up banana we'd go all the line two we'll see that the prices is four so this part is going to get evaluated to four we will look up banana in the stock dictionary we would see that the quantity of that is six so we would get 4 times 6 4 times 6 is 24 this part a values to 24 now with set print 24 and then it would say total is equal to 0 plus 24 which means total is equal to 24 which means that this total is also not equal to 24 this is how incrementing works now next time it's looping through and let's say it is Apple now now in okay we got to go back just so I have that code the total was at 24 let's remember that now we're going to go again and let's say this time it's Apple and prices we got app will look up Apple in prices and we'll look up Apple in stock apples price is $2 or whatever currency you're in and then Apple stock is 0 2 times 0 gives you 0 value is 0 and total is equal to total plus value this total is 24 is zero and so this effectively stays at 24 and then we loop again okay so I think you get the idea and I will move on from this part now okay and then finally outside your loop print total okay so outside the loop right if we keep it indented underneath the for loop then it's going to keep looping over and over again but we want to print out total only one so we're going to keep it outside of the loop here you can see 40 a 45 24 and all of that stuff and then total you see is 117 dollars right that's the total value of your store okay not a very expensive not a lot of money are making there so on fruit but hey better than nothing shopping at the market great work now we're going to take a step back from a management side and take a look through the eyes of the shopper in order for customers to order online we're going to have to make a consumer interface don't worry it's easier than it sounds so what we are going to be doing is we're going to make a list called groceries with the values banana orange and apple okay that's cool because we remember I was creating a lot of stuff with groceries earlier and I didn't even know about that they're going to be teaching you this so this is exciting everything that I was foreshadowing is coming into play somehow and I think we're going to keep this to be the last video of this this is we're going to keep this section to be the last section of this tutorial and then we'll continue afterward after that why don't we get tick marks for any of these that's weird okay so save and submit code gradually let's do one more part because that was very easy took no time at all oh now they're getting into some big stuff right here so what they're doing here is they defined a function whoops so they're doing is defined a function called sum which takes in as input up I'm assuming it says numbers here so I'm assuming it takes in a list of numbers and then it keeps a counter variable like total right there then it goes for each number in the list numbers are increment total by that number increment this is just like saying total plus number so increment total by that number and then return total so all it does is it goes one then it goes plus two so now total will be at three then it will see that we have five so we'll do 3 plus 5 we'll get back eight then it'll say eight plus ten right here we'll get back 18 and then it will say that plus 13 and we'll get back 31 and then I'll return 31 and this part will print out 31 and then we're good to go so let's now actually tangibly look at what might happen if we pass then this list and so here we define this function right when you define a function nothing happens right you just define it so if I print out nothing is going to get print out you have to call your function it's just like saying if I defined a variable V is equal to 5 well that's not going to do anything in and of itself I have to say a print V or whatever I have to call V and then it shows me the value of what V is so just like that we have to call our function but our function is dependent on a list of numbers so here we're creating a list N and we're giving it numbers 1 2 5 10 and 13 so we're calling our functions some and we're passing in this list over here so what's effectively happening is it comes to this here it puts in that list now it goes boom I've initialized total to zero let's get going this numbers is 1 2 5 10 13 the first time we loop through number is 1 so total gets incremented this is a shorthand for the incremental notation it gets incremented by 1 so effectively this total here becomes 1 then the loop goes again and it goes okay now I'm so what I'm going to do is that so this part here says number right so now this part is 2 and so total gets incremented by 2 and we get 3 2 here then it becomes 5 it gets implemented by 5 this becomes 8 and once all that happens it's finally 13 or sorry this part is finally 13 total gets incremented by 13 so at that point whatever it is something like 31 and you return 31 so what you've done is you've taken this whole list and add it all up and that's how you return 31 makes sense if you do 1 plus 2 plus 5 plus 10 just to doublecheck you indeed get 31 and so will your function so let's call our function now with the given list and let's see if it gives us back 31 print Python 3 parent is a function you have to put parentheses after it and we indeed do get 31 so define a function anytime this I define a function where a d EF compute bill takes one argument food as input in the function create a variable total with initial values 0 for each item in the list for each every time I here for each I'm writing a for loop for each item in the list so item in food or in shopping list soon um right this variable right here shopping list that's where I'm getting that from and item is just a arbitrary variable you can call it whatever you want I'm gonna call it item and after put a colon and hit enter after that don't forget at the price of the item to total so I'm going to say I'm going to get the user prices so I'm going to take the variable total and I'm going to increment it using the shorthand notation and to get the price of that item so here banana orange and apple well which dictionary am I going to look up the pricing of that item in stock no I'm going to look it up in prices so I'm going to call the prices dictionary pass in that item as a key and I'm going to be incrementing total by that and then it says a return total so after we are done with that it's going to return total so the first time is going to be banana banana and then it's going to look up a banana in the dictionary and it's going to increment this by 4 then you look up orange it's going to look for it's going to be orange and the shopping list it's going to come down here it's going to look up orange in the prices that whole part is going to get evaluated to 1.5 this is going to get incremented by one point five so this is now going to be you know what was it for so now it's going to be five point five and it's going to maybe return that right or add Apple and then return it um okay cool so let's take a look at how this works compute bill Apple return something incorrect hmm let's see what we did wrong note that your function should work for any food list let's see why it returned a wrong answer I have total here I loop through I use the key to access that item I increment total by that and then once the loop is over I return the total so once it passed it Apple for some reason it returned oh I see I'm being silly I should not be using okay so this is a common mistake that beginners made and apparently I've made that's what happens when you're live coding you make a lot of silly mistakes but it's okay because it's part of a learning experience what I forgot to notice that it's a function so we're taking in food as a parameter so I'm not going to hard code and put this shopping list on line one from line one I should actually put food here this way you don't have to give me this exact exact list you could be giving you a different list for example if you gave me a list like this my code should work fine but if you also gave me a list with just one item Apple the code should also work fine but in this case shopping list if you use this function compute Bill and you try to pass in a list with like let's say just Apple what's going to happen is that is going to still be using the shopping list and not what you actually gave me as input so silly little mistake there let's fix that with food and that should be now golden okay perfect this this is it for this video guys please if you get a chance we've just reached 100
