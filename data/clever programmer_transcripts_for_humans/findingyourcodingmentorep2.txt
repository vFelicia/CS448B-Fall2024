06:13 - today
06:14 - well i guess let's just talk about
06:17 - getting started
06:18 - right yeah because guys there's going to
06:20 - be so many different points in your life
06:22 - where you just got to get started
06:24 - doesn't matter if it's programming
06:25 - doesn't matter if it's a podcast
06:27 - it doesn't matter if it's anything right
06:28 - but yeah you could talk about it all the
06:30 - time
06:31 - until you actually do something right so
06:33 - there's lots of people that are going to
06:35 - go through that process of wanting to
06:36 - become developers
06:37 - right it just becomes an idea and
06:40 - they just have to be able to actually
06:42 - start somewhere and actually have to
06:43 - start to take action
06:45 - in a specific part of their life yeah
06:47 - and if you guys have any questions
06:48 - uh just let us know we'll be able to
06:50 - answer them as well right
06:51 - somebody said how hard is it to become a
06:53 - developer how long will it right there
06:55 - so how hard is it to become a front end
06:57 - developer and how long will i in what i
06:58 - need to learn
06:59 - good question good question so um you
07:02 - want to go ahead and get started
07:04 - yeah man it depends right it's going to
07:06 - depend on a lot of things what type of
07:08 - program you're trying to become
07:09 - right how much time are you going to put
07:11 - into that are you just going to do like
07:12 - a couple hours a week or you can go
07:14 - full in and all out are you going to
07:16 - have the right mentors are you going to
07:17 - have the right guidance or you can be
07:18 - wasting a lot of time you know dabbling
07:21 - and like udemy courses and all these
07:22 - different things so
07:23 - it's going to depend on a lot of
07:25 - different things that you are trying to
07:27 - do
07:28 - and it's kind of like there's no perfect
07:31 - answer for them
07:32 - yeah sometimes if you do everything
07:34 - right it might take you some time right
07:36 - assuming you do everything right
07:37 - something you put in the work
07:38 - you have the right guidance and things
07:39 - like that i think it could be done in
07:41 - around half a year
07:43 - to a year time frame yeah i think six
07:46 - months to a year time frame is a pretty
07:47 - pretty pretty good uh pretty good way of
07:50 - going about this
07:51 - amy says where are you where you even
07:54 - get a mentor well
07:55 - if you're interested in the mentor right
07:56 - we can definitely be there to help you

08:33 - actually help you guys i'll help you out
08:35 - on that point but
08:36 - we're even gonna mentor i mean um where
08:39 - i personally got a mentor from um when i
08:42 - when i got my first job like i had a job
08:46 - it was a it was a beginning it was a
08:48 - beginner uh
08:50 - programming job and i literally got it
08:52 - for free so i was working for free for
08:53 - the longest time
08:54 - yeah literally a year and a half guys
08:56 - for a year and a half i was working
08:58 - completely for free without any pay
09:01 - right
09:02 - and i was like i saw these guys were
09:04 - doing some cool startup you know
09:06 - and i literally came up with them i'm
09:08 - like hey guys this is so cool
09:10 - is there anyone that can help out you
09:12 - know
09:13 - and they're like yeah yeah sure sure so
09:15 - they gave me like a really cool um
09:18 - uh project to do not a cool project for
09:20 - me to do to test out who how i am
09:23 - and literally at that point i was like i
09:25 - had to create like uh what's it called
09:27 - that was really funny
09:28 - i had to create a um what's it called um
09:32 - oh a scraper a scraper but using python
09:35 - with beautiful soup classic i had no
09:38 - idea what python was guys
09:40 - i literally the first thing i did when i
09:41 - went to uh when i went to the thing
09:44 - when i went to the uh when i went online
09:47 - i was like what is python you're like
09:48 - where'd i get a snake from
09:50 - where can i get this and i don't like
09:52 - snakes
09:54 - i'm not a big fan of snakes but you know
09:56 - i was like
09:57 - what is python you know the next thing
09:59 - you know i was like okay okay i guess
10:00 - it's a programming language
10:01 - then after that point i kind of went on
10:03 - and you know uh
10:05 - do did more things and at that point um
10:08 - i built the project in like two days a
10:09 - little did not sleep at all
10:12 - and i decided to work with them and i
10:13 - built this project showed that they're
10:14 - like holy this is awesome they
10:16 - loved
10:16 - what i did and that's it and i started
10:19 - working with them and then i
10:20 - the mentors were they they became my
10:21 - mentors right um
10:24 - and they showed me around you know what
10:25 - is django how to build projects
10:27 - next thing you know i'm building like a
10:28 - big jingle project with them right
10:31 - i'm learning how to build a startup
10:32 - company i am learning how to you know
10:34 - get started on
10:35 - you know creating an idea from literally
10:38 - an idea
10:39 - to reality yeah that's that's crazy
10:42 - that's a great place to have those
10:43 - mentors yeah right
10:44 - so like where would you find a mentor
10:46 - yeah and i mean that's a great question
10:48 - so i guess
10:48 - when i think about that right it's going
10:51 - to come down to a few things
10:53 - right if you want to be able to have a
10:55 - mentor
10:56 - most likely unless unless it's like some
10:59 - relative or some friend who's doing it
11:01 - who's willing to just do it for free or
11:03 - whatever yeah there has to be some sort
11:05 - of exchange of value
11:06 - and even then even with the friend
11:07 - there's still an exchange of value
11:09 - because
11:09 - they probably have some sort of
11:11 - fulfillment yeah by kind of helping you
11:13 - and guiding you
11:14 - yeah very much so so you know unless
11:16 - you're not and you're in that case then
11:18 - there's probably two things that you're
11:19 - gonna have to do
11:19 - is one you're either gonna have to
11:21 - exchange your time like how nas did
11:24 - no that's what's exchanging his time
11:25 - knowledge was working for them for
11:28 - free the value he gave them was his free
11:29 - work they were able to get a result from
11:31 - the projects and whatever they were
11:32 - doing
11:33 - or you're gonna have to exchange your
11:34 - money so that's like paying someone
11:36 - hourly at code mentor
11:38 - joining some sort of course or whatever
11:40 - that looks like to making sure that
11:42 - you're able to get in front with the
11:44 - right teachers
11:45 - correct so you're gonna have to bring
11:47 - something to the table
11:48 - to be able to find that mentor because
11:50 - very often people go and they're like
11:52 - you know like go sending out messages
11:53 - like you know i remember
11:55 - i was there like sending a message to
11:56 - gary be like garyvee mentor me you said
11:59 - that really
11:59 - you're on those people i was one of
12:01 - those people molly
12:03 - you know because that's those are like
12:04 - the things they say but the thing is
12:07 - that's not how you're gonna get
12:08 - mentorship you have to bring something
12:10 - to the table
12:11 - and usually that's going to be one of
12:12 - the two big things which is either time
12:13 - and money
12:14 - and for me it was also very similar to
12:15 - nazi story right i ended up doing time
12:18 - right so i ended up going to a local
12:20 - startup and i wanted to get into mobile
12:21 - development
12:22 - and i asked them like hey are there
12:23 - literally like any projects that you
12:25 - guys have in the back burner
12:26 - mobile development wise you guys don't
12:28 - have a plan for that i could just start
12:29 - to work on like at least get a design
12:31 - out there for you guys and move it
12:32 - forward yeah yeah and get the
12:34 - yeah so they give me like some shitty
12:35 - projects
12:37 - but i didn't care bro i was excited dude
12:39 - because i had now i had the resources to
12:42 - ask them
12:42 - questions right and be like oh okay okay
12:44 - so i'm building it out like this
12:46 - like i'm designing a database like this
12:47 - what do you think about that you know
12:48 - like oh like look at this research
12:50 - i was like oh dang like i was learning a
12:52 - lot really really quick so it was
12:54 - important to be able to get that mentor
12:56 - yeah no i agree i agree
12:58 - like with the mentorship that i got from
12:59 - that that one person i mean
13:01 - there are two people that i always talk
13:03 - about them their name is steve
13:04 - and robert um and you know they they
13:07 - also also watch my content
13:09 - a lot all the time and um what's up
13:11 - steven rubber
13:14 - but but yeah i mean i mean robert
13:16 - especially when i first came in like he
13:18 - it's crazy robert initially he like he
13:20 - wasn't
13:22 - like he initially i kind of knew more
13:25 - about databases and like html websites
13:27 - when i first met him and then he joined
13:29 - this startup company and then next thing
13:31 - like he became this amazing person who
13:32 - just like knew so much
13:34 - like literally you know within two
13:35 - months because steve mentored him
13:37 - right he became really good next thing
13:39 - you know i came out like holy
13:40 - robert you just got
13:41 - really good within literally a few
13:42 - months and then
13:44 - he mentored me right together with steve
13:48 - and you know steve you know he taught me
13:50 - things like you know
13:51 - project management he taught me things
13:52 - like how to lead how to become a leader
13:54 - uh because steve was a it was an amazing
13:56 - leader right um
13:58 - you know he taught me a lot of things
13:59 - about that you know lilly went from
14:02 - who from knowing html css
14:05 - and then within a month to two months i
14:07 - was building scrapers a whole scraper
14:10 - system that was using scrapy
14:11 - that was scraping from amazon from
14:13 - zappos
14:14 - from nordstrom and so forth and it was a
14:17 - whole system
14:18 - and we even went to our what's it called
14:20 - um
14:21 - we went to our uh what's his name um
14:24 - teacher like at school to figure out how
14:26 - our database should look like
14:28 - damn yeah it was so much fun like that's
14:31 - legit man those are those are the cool
14:33 - projects because i always talk about
14:35 - that like building projects outside of
14:36 - school yeah like
14:38 - guys if you just do the if you happen to
14:40 - go to school for computer science
14:41 - yeah and you just do the minimum amount
14:43 - of school work that's not going to get
14:44 - any recruiters attention
14:46 - yeah right like you have to be able to
14:48 - plus it's it's just like the bare
14:50 - minimum that you have to learn
14:51 - right yeah i agree so so it's like if
14:52 - you do those things outside of school
14:55 - right whether you stick in school or not
14:56 - that's where actually get that
14:58 - experience stats are actually going to
14:59 - build like amazing projects and then
15:01 - it's like exciting to you too because
15:02 - you're like holy like who else is
15:03 - building this stuff you know
15:04 - yeah yeah yeah yeah like i think i think
15:07 - from my perspective i think
15:08 - um yeah do things outside of school like
15:11 - do
15:12 - one i always tell to people you know
15:14 - don't don't rely on school

17:45 - free
17:45 - and we were all three of us were working
17:47 - at this company you know it was trendala
17:49 - on this application called trindala and
17:52 - and yeah
17:52 - like we worked together for free for
17:55 - like a year
17:56 - and then he while being in our office we
17:58 - were working for free he was working
18:00 - also working with this other company at
18:02 - the same time
18:02 - in the specific office i'm not sure if
18:05 - he wasn't if he was working for free for
18:06 - them or working part-time for them not
18:08 - really sure i forget that portion at
18:09 - this point but
18:10 - uh dude well let's just let's just say
18:12 - that story man because it sounds like a
18:14 - crazy story that robert has to come in
18:16 - here and freaking
18:17 - you're saying over here we'll watch them
18:18 - on podcast episode three that's right
18:22 - come in soon bro let's go but yeah man i
18:23 - mean that's just classic example dude
18:25 - like nas myself
18:26 - robert like we we put in the work
18:30 - right in the beginning and that goes
18:32 - back to what we said in the beginning
18:33 - this podcast which is
18:34 - just getting started right that big
18:36 - scary project
18:38 - yeah just getting started on that right
18:39 - those first few lines of code i mean
18:41 - do you remember the first lines of code
18:43 - you ever wrote by any chance
18:46 - not like exactly what they were but like
18:47 - where where was the first line of code
18:49 - that you wrote like were you in class
18:50 - were you up like
18:51 - what was going on first lines of code oh
18:54 - man my mind was in class dude mine was
18:56 - in
18:57 - high school ap computer science
18:59 - that teacher bro
19:00 - you know like this teacher tell me we
19:03 - were learning java right
19:05 - this teacher would just show up and just
19:07 - babysit us
19:08 - they're like hey like like she would
19:10 - just be like hey
19:12 - go read chapter three and do these
19:13 - exercises really and she would just
19:15 - answer questions if anyone had any
19:16 - questions
19:17 - great teachers the first the first lines
19:19 - of code i wrote it was in java i tried
19:21 - to write my main function
19:23 - and i wrote system that out that print
19:26 - outside of my main function and it
19:27 - wasn't working and i was like what the
19:29 - why isn't this working really yeah i
19:31 - know the hell i was doing
19:33 - didn't matter what i was reading you
19:34 - know but honestly because of that
19:36 - i didn't do programming for a while
19:38 - really so instead i went to electrical
19:40 - engineering
19:41 - and i did electrical engineering so
19:42 - because of that teacher yeah dude i was
19:45 - like screw that teacher and then
19:46 - it was even crazier bro because as i was
19:48 - doing electrical engineering and i had a
19:50 - second class which was you know uh
19:52 - c programming so software development
19:54 - but for electrical engineering you know
19:55 - i was going through my lower uh right
19:57 - lower division class
19:58 - yeah yeah yeah yeah and that teacher
20:01 - also sucked man that teacher just read
20:02 - out of the powerpoints right but
20:04 - there was something that kept on
20:05 - bringing me back to that wow wow
20:07 - dude i feel like i really there's
20:09 - something that i like something there
20:11 - so i actually ended up double majoring
20:12 - for a while and
20:14 - unfortunately now i finally had a good
20:16 - teacher so it wasn't until my third try
20:17 - that a good teacher
20:18 - yeah and you're also like dude i knew i
20:20 - was gonna like this like i knew there
20:22 - was something here that i really liked
20:24 - and
20:24 - and so what pushed it to do it again
20:25 - like you know we'll push do it again
20:27 - it's uh and at what time because you
20:29 - said you sweet you went
20:30 - you went away from it yeah yeah so in
20:34 - uh junior year high school was when i
20:36 - took the ap computer science class and
20:37 - okay like screw this like
20:38 - i wasn't learning anything i just did
20:40 - one i didn't do the whole year i did one
20:41 - semester and i switched out of that
20:42 - right
20:44 - and i actually started like electric
20:45 - engineering stuff and i started to like
20:47 - that stuff they were building circuits
20:48 - and stuff like that
20:49 - went to college did freshman sophomore
20:53 - oh and half of junior year in electrical
20:56 - engineering
20:56 - no way yeah dude i did not know that
20:59 - about you yeah but i'm a beast
21:05 - but but then then that's when we had
21:07 - that software class and i took it and
21:08 - again i hated like dude
21:10 - i cheated my way through that class
21:11 - because i didn't understand what i was
21:12 - doing bro
21:13 - really i was like what the is a
21:14 - pointer what's it what's a double
21:16 - pointer you know
21:17 - why i wanna see plus plus so it was a
21:18 - variable i know it wasn't even t plus
21:20 - plus it was c
21:21 - bro i hated it bro um but
21:24 - but then yeah man that's when i was all
21:27 - like dude like
21:28 - something was still like in there like
21:30 - man i was like i still kind of
21:32 - like i like the idea of programming but
21:34 - i feel like i didn't have a fair shot
21:36 - with the other two instructors
21:37 - really so then that's when i i declared
21:39 - a double major so i could start to take
21:41 - those classes
21:42 - and then after my second semester i just
21:44 - dropped electrical engineering
21:46 - and part of that came up from the
21:47 - frustration as well because i dude i
21:48 - went to a university
21:49 - yeah where the acceptance rate is 100
21:52 - percent
21:53 - like they don't reject a single person
21:54 - why what kind of verse did you go to man
21:56 - it's badass bro
21:58 - dude so it's like no it wasn't like this
22:00 - top tier university or anything like
22:02 - that you know
22:03 - yeah um so yeah dude like just some of
22:05 - the professors there
22:07 - i hate to say it are garbage and that's
22:09 - what i experienced in electrical
22:10 - engineering as well
22:11 - when you say the school's name yeah utep
22:14 - oh really is that it yeah i mean look
22:17 - man
22:18 - i love it it helped me create the
22:20 - stepping stone but at the end of the day
22:22 - some of those teachers
22:23 - they just showed up to the class and
22:24 - read from the powerpoint and didn't
22:25 - teach anything
22:26 - yeah that's a very unfortunate portion
22:28 - about like uh universities and things
22:30 - like that that's what i see a lot like
22:32 - like even for example roberts or steve's
22:34 - you know or my friend another case
22:36 - case like we when we first got our jobs
22:39 - like
22:40 - we did not have a degree at all like
22:41 - because we we early on realized that
22:44 - we're not going to get the education as
22:47 - as we thought we would
22:48 - and it's very unfortunate i don't know
22:50 - what it will take you know
22:52 - i don't know what it will take for
22:53 - university to finally make some change
22:56 - right to finally make some change around
22:57 - this but i'm sorry
22:59 - people talk about this every single time
23:02 - right
23:02 - they just you know they stick with what
23:04 - they used to teach
23:06 - you know i'm i'm not gonna lie
23:09 - we used to uh there was this thing and
23:11 - actually robert probably remembers as
23:13 - well because that's that's when i
23:14 - really really got to know him even
23:16 - better through that is we were in this
23:18 - class it was a programming class it was
23:20 - a beginner's programming class
23:22 - and the teacher we had to use like uh we
23:24 - didn't we couldn't use git
23:26 - so we were learning a version control
23:28 - system called
23:30 - smart something it was like i don't know
23:32 - i don't even know anymore
23:34 - but it was a vertical system that was
23:37 - outdated by 10 years
23:39 - wow it's like it wasn't yet it was
23:42 - it was a version control system we would
23:44 - not use it and all we had to do was
23:45 - follow instructions to like okay commit
23:47 - this code you know
23:49 - and we couldn't even get to work because
23:51 - it was so old
23:54 - and i'm just like i'm sitting in there
23:55 - you know and i'm saying that
23:57 - and i'm like like what am i doing here
24:01 - come on in bro come on in so what are
24:02 - you doing

25:20 - come for a podcast it's gonna be the
25:23 - next episode
25:24 - yeah i mean here i mean no i mean online
25:29 - or here oh yeah he's coming to visit
25:31 - here at california so we'll make it live
25:33 - i don't know robert why are you coming
25:34 - by the way let me know the date let me
25:36 - know the date
25:38 - if not noz will hit you up if you're
25:40 - still the one
25:44 - [Laughter]
25:50 - oh we should probably wait send it to me
25:52 - through send it to me through slack i'll
25:54 - i'll
25:54 - i'll uh send you just like a plate for
25:56 - everybody okay
25:59 - oh in three weeks let's go
26:01 - [Laughter]
26:03 - awesome sweet sweet sweet amazing cool
26:05 - so um
26:06 - yeah like as i was saying like it was
26:08 - very outdated very outdated you know
26:11 - and yeah and i'm gonna say like
26:12 - obviously it's not even to generalize
26:14 - universities but
26:16 - you know like at my university where
26:17 - it's like a place like that
26:19 - you're you're not gonna have like like
26:21 - the purpose of university is
26:23 - to have people to do research not to
26:25 - have people to teach yes so
26:26 - unfortunately in some of those places
26:27 - you're gonna find people that just show
26:29 - up there and care about their research
26:30 - and they don't care about really
26:32 - teaching they're not really passionate
26:33 - about that correct right
26:34 - but but then again like in other
26:36 - universities like my brother
26:38 - he he ended up going to mit when i tell
26:40 - him about that experience
26:42 - he didn't have that experience with the
26:43 - single professor right really like the
26:45 - professor is great that's
26:46 - awesome i know and that that speaks
26:48 - again to the
26:50 - the level of the university right
26:52 - because it's like the professors there
26:53 - are obviously gonna be
26:54 - the best like some of the best in the
26:56 - nation in the world wow
26:58 - right wow so they have to be like high
27:00 - quality and things like that so of
27:01 - course there was
27:02 - a lot of stress a lot of pressure it was
27:03 - very difficult but it was like
27:06 - professors that cared that's good i love
27:08 - professional
27:09 - professors like that exactly in the end
27:11 - that's what's going to make the
27:11 - difference between
27:13 - anything right it's going to be the
27:15 - professors that are happy to be
27:17 - in that classroom whether it's virtual
27:19 - course whether it's a live course or
27:20 - whether it's
27:21 - recording whatever that ends up being
27:23 - man because that's that's what really
27:24 - changes so
27:25 - i don't know how we got in this tangent
27:27 - but i agree some of the stuff is
27:28 - outdated yeah
27:29 - yeah yeah yeah exactly and guys i know
27:31 - that you know right now
27:33 - what's gonna happen is we're going to
27:34 - get a lot be live on this podcast every
27:36 - single
27:37 - every single day um at this point i do
27:39 - have to jump on the meeting

kazi literally popped up as you're writing clever i know right there right there this is the one right there there we go so everything kind of should be on here right uh holy moly july 16 16th the last one was episode one clever programmer audio experience you see cp on clubhouse episode 1 april 14th look at that look at that that's beautiful that's beautiful guys and again if you have any questions or tour for us um you know feel free to leave them down below in the comments and if you just honestly if you want to talk to us because we would love to talk to you and if you want to actually get in the call um here's what you what i want you guys to do okay really really important okay i want us to i want you to text me text us okay we have a community we're going to get a text message from you guys yeah text us what does it text us uh let's see i want you to text us podcast so let me do this right now on the chris community just called a podcast text us podcast to this number okay listen up really quickly guys okay let me show you this um podcast right there there we go so text us podcast to what number should they text us to the number that that we have right there at two so remember this guys two two four six five one eight eight one seven so again that's two two four six five one eight eight one seven text podcast podcast to that number and we'll be able to then actually call you from our number at that point and that's pretty much it and then we'll just get a call uh no problem whatsoever awesome so what shall we talk about today well i guess let's just talk about getting started right yeah because guys there's going to be so many different points in your life where you just got to get started doesn't matter if it's programming doesn't matter if it's a podcast it doesn't matter if it's anything right but yeah you could talk about it all the time until you actually do something right so there's lots of people that are going to go through that process of wanting to become developers right it just becomes an idea and they just have to be able to actually start somewhere and actually have to start to take action in a specific part of their life yeah and if you guys have any questions uh just let us know we'll be able to answer them as well right somebody said how hard is it to become a developer how long will it right there so how hard is it to become a front end developer and how long will i in what i need to learn good question good question so um you want to go ahead and get started yeah man it depends right it's going to depend on a lot of things what type of program you're trying to become right how much time are you going to put into that are you just going to do like a couple hours a week or you can go full in and all out are you going to have the right mentors are you going to have the right guidance or you can be wasting a lot of time you know dabbling and like udemy courses and all these different things so it's going to depend on a lot of different things that you are trying to do and it's kind of like there's no perfect answer for them yeah sometimes if you do everything right it might take you some time right assuming you do everything right something you put in the work you have the right guidance and things like that i think it could be done in around half a year to a year time frame yeah i think six months to a year time frame is a pretty pretty pretty good uh pretty good way of going about this amy says where are you where you even get a mentor well if you're interested in the mentor right we can definitely be there to help you guys out like i said amy if you are interested i want you guys to text here text here i'm going to put a text podcast text podcast podcast 2 to uh what number let me see this again two two four two two four six five one right there two four six five one pump six five one and then 8817 so right there okay i'm gonna send this to you guys okay so text podcast to that number guys and then uh it will maybe we might be able to actually help you guys i'll help you out on that point but we're even gonna mentor i mean um where i personally got a mentor from um when i when i got my first job like i had a job it was a it was a beginning it was a beginner uh programming job and i literally got it for free so i was working for free for the longest time yeah literally a year and a half guys for a year and a half i was working completely for free without any pay right and i was like i saw these guys were doing some cool startup you know and i literally came up with them i'm like hey guys this is so cool is there anyone that can help out you know and they're like yeah yeah sure sure so they gave me like a really cool um uh project to do not a cool project for me to do to test out who how i am and literally at that point i was like i had to create like uh what's it called that was really funny i had to create a um what's it called um oh a scraper a scraper but using python with beautiful soup classic i had no idea what python was guys i literally the first thing i did when i went to uh when i went to the thing when i went to the uh when i went online i was like what is python you're like where'd i get a snake from where can i get this and i don't like snakes i'm not a big fan of snakes but you know i was like what is python you know the next thing you know i was like okay okay i guess it's a programming language then after that point i kind of went on and you know uh do did more things and at that point um i built the project in like two days a little did not sleep at all and i decided to work with them and i built this project showed that they're like holy this is awesome they loved what i did and that's it and i started working with them and then i the mentors were they they became my mentors right um and they showed me around you know what is django how to build projects next thing you know i'm building like a big jingle project with them right i'm learning how to build a startup company i am learning how to you know get started on you know creating an idea from literally an idea to reality yeah that's that's crazy that's a great place to have those mentors yeah right so like where would you find a mentor yeah and i mean that's a great question so i guess when i think about that right it's going to come down to a few things right if you want to be able to have a mentor most likely unless unless it's like some relative or some friend who's doing it who's willing to just do it for free or whatever yeah there has to be some sort of exchange of value and even then even with the friend there's still an exchange of value because they probably have some sort of fulfillment yeah by kind of helping you and guiding you yeah very much so so you know unless you're not and you're in that case then there's probably two things that you're gonna have to do is one you're either gonna have to exchange your time like how nas did no that's what's exchanging his time knowledge was working for them for free the value he gave them was his free work they were able to get a result from the projects and whatever they were doing or you're gonna have to exchange your money so that's like paying someone hourly at code mentor joining some sort of course or whatever that looks like to making sure that you're able to get in front with the right teachers correct so you're gonna have to bring something to the table to be able to find that mentor because very often people go and they're like you know like go sending out messages like you know i remember i was there like sending a message to gary be like garyvee mentor me you said that really you're on those people i was one of those people molly you know because that's those are like the things they say but the thing is that's not how you're gonna get mentorship you have to bring something to the table and usually that's going to be one of the two big things which is either time and money and for me it was also very similar to nazi story right i ended up doing time right so i ended up going to a local startup and i wanted to get into mobile development and i asked them like hey are there literally like any projects that you guys have in the back burner mobile development wise you guys don't have a plan for that i could just start to work on like at least get a design out there for you guys and move it forward yeah yeah and get the yeah so they give me like some shitty projects but i didn't care bro i was excited dude because i had now i had the resources to ask them questions right and be like oh okay okay so i'm building it out like this like i'm designing a database like this what do you think about that you know like oh like look at this research i was like oh dang like i was learning a lot really really quick so it was important to be able to get that mentor yeah no i agree i agree like with the mentorship that i got from that that one person i mean there are two people that i always talk about them their name is steve and robert um and you know they they also also watch my content a lot all the time and um what's up steven rubber but but yeah i mean i mean robert especially when i first came in like he it's crazy robert initially he like he wasn't like he initially i kind of knew more about databases and like html websites when i first met him and then he joined this startup company and then next thing like he became this amazing person who just like knew so much like literally you know within two months because steve mentored him right he became really good next thing you know i came out like holy robert you just got really good within literally a few months and then he mentored me right together with steve and you know steve you know he taught me things like you know project management he taught me things like how to lead how to become a leader uh because steve was a it was an amazing leader right um you know he taught me a lot of things about that you know lilly went from who from knowing html css and then within a month to two months i was building scrapers a whole scraper system that was using scrapy that was scraping from amazon from zappos from nordstrom and so forth and it was a whole system and we even went to our what's it called um we went to our uh what's his name um teacher like at school to figure out how our database should look like damn yeah it was so much fun like that's legit man those are those are the cool projects because i always talk about that like building projects outside of school yeah like guys if you just do the if you happen to go to school for computer science yeah and you just do the minimum amount of school work that's not going to get any recruiters attention yeah right like you have to be able to plus it's it's just like the bare minimum that you have to learn right yeah i agree so so it's like if you do those things outside of school right whether you stick in school or not that's where actually get that experience stats are actually going to build like amazing projects and then it's like exciting to you too because you're like holy like who else is building this stuff you know yeah yeah yeah yeah like i think i think from my perspective i think um yeah do things outside of school like do one i always tell to people you know don't don't rely on school just to to get you the job to become a developer right it takes a lot more than that uh you know for us for example yo robert's here holy holy nah robert i was just talking about you i only hope that you you heard me yeah just go back like about a minute or two holy moly no way guys say hi to robert right here holy oh man this just made my day that's amazing oh man kind of love that guy love you too bro i love you too man wow ah god you see you see like you have people like you or like like that around you like i haven't seen him in like a year or probably so forth today's day you know like we support each other now whenever whenever whenever we call he's like yeah what's up what you're doing you know he's always like hi all always like working on his amazing stuff he's like he works at a company right now and you rob are you coming to visit oh let's go yo robert we're gonna have to bring you in on this man let's go get third mike here guys who wants to bring robert here for a podcast dude you put the wrong one there wait which one you go wrong [Laughter] yeah drop some fire in the comments if you want to be able to talk to robert one of nasa's mentors and friends drop that fire so we know we can bring him over here he's an amazing guy like great explainer right really cares about people right like have them come need him let's go let's go oh yeah the robber you're you're on the spot now so yeah we'll definitely bring him on once he comes in once he comes here i will definitely have him as a guest here but yeah no he's just an amazing person right taught me a lot personally um i always talk talk about him and now he's just building crazy stuff he works at a company uh what's the company he works at a company oh shoot i already forgot loan loan company it's a loan company hold on no cooking loans there we go cooking loans and yeah he's just building amazing stuff right now like building infrastructures and everything he loves it you know he enjoys it so so did robert also start off like like you what's up always so he he started off yeah kind of like me as well because he started off working with steve initially because he was working with steve initially um yeah he started out just working for free and we were all three of us were working at this company you know it was trendala on this application called trindala and and yeah like we worked together for free for like a year and then he while being in our office we were working for free he was working also working with this other company at the same time in the specific office i'm not sure if he wasn't if he was working for free for them or working parttime for them not really sure i forget that portion at this point but uh dude well let's just let's just say that story man because it sounds like a crazy story that robert has to come in here and freaking you're saying over here we'll watch them on podcast episode three that's right come in soon bro let's go but yeah man i mean that's just classic example dude like nas myself robert like we we put in the work right in the beginning and that goes back to what we said in the beginning this podcast which is just getting started right that big scary project yeah just getting started on that right those first few lines of code i mean do you remember the first lines of code you ever wrote by any chance not like exactly what they were but like where where was the first line of code that you wrote like were you in class were you up like what was going on first lines of code oh man my mind was in class dude mine was in high school ap computer science that teacher bro you know like this teacher tell me we were learning java right this teacher would just show up and just babysit us they're like hey like like she would just be like hey go read chapter three and do these exercises really and she would just answer questions if anyone had any questions great teachers the first the first lines of code i wrote it was in java i tried to write my main function and i wrote system that out that print outside of my main function and it wasn't working and i was like what the why isn't this working really yeah i know the hell i was doing didn't matter what i was reading you know but honestly because of that i didn't do programming for a while really so instead i went to electrical engineering and i did electrical engineering so because of that teacher yeah dude i was like screw that teacher and then it was even crazier bro because as i was doing electrical engineering and i had a second class which was you know uh c programming so software development but for electrical engineering you know i was going through my lower uh right lower division class yeah yeah yeah yeah and that teacher also sucked man that teacher just read out of the powerpoints right but there was something that kept on bringing me back to that wow wow dude i feel like i really there's something that i like something there so i actually ended up double majoring for a while and unfortunately now i finally had a good teacher so it wasn't until my third try that a good teacher yeah and you're also like dude i knew i was gonna like this like i knew there was something here that i really liked and and so what pushed it to do it again like you know we'll push do it again it's uh and at what time because you said you sweet you went you went away from it yeah yeah so in uh junior year high school was when i took the ap computer science class and okay like screw this like i wasn't learning anything i just did one i didn't do the whole year i did one semester and i switched out of that right and i actually started like electric engineering stuff and i started to like that stuff they were building circuits and stuff like that went to college did freshman sophomore oh and half of junior year in electrical engineering no way yeah dude i did not know that about you yeah but i'm a beast but but then then that's when we had that software class and i took it and again i hated like dude i cheated my way through that class because i didn't understand what i was doing bro really i was like what the is a pointer what's it what's a double pointer you know why i wanna see plus plus so it was a variable i know it wasn't even t plus plus it was c bro i hated it bro um but but then yeah man that's when i was all like dude like something was still like in there like man i was like i still kind of like i like the idea of programming but i feel like i didn't have a fair shot with the other two instructors really so then that's when i i declared a double major so i could start to take those classes and then after my second semester i just dropped electrical engineering and part of that came up from the frustration as well because i dude i went to a university yeah where the acceptance rate is 100 percent like they don't reject a single person why what kind of verse did you go to man it's badass bro dude so it's like no it wasn't like this top tier university or anything like that you know yeah um so yeah dude like just some of the professors there i hate to say it are garbage and that's what i experienced in electrical engineering as well when you say the school's name yeah utep oh really is that it yeah i mean look man i love it it helped me create the stepping stone but at the end of the day some of those teachers they just showed up to the class and read from the powerpoint and didn't teach anything yeah that's a very unfortunate portion about like uh universities and things like that that's what i see a lot like like even for example roberts or steve's you know or my friend another case case like we when we first got our jobs like we did not have a degree at all like because we we early on realized that we're not going to get the education as as we thought we would and it's very unfortunate i don't know what it will take you know i don't know what it will take for university to finally make some change right to finally make some change around this but i'm sorry people talk about this every single time right they just you know they stick with what they used to teach you know i'm i'm not gonna lie we used to uh there was this thing and actually robert probably remembers as well because that's that's when i really really got to know him even better through that is we were in this class it was a programming class it was a beginner's programming class and the teacher we had to use like uh we didn't we couldn't use git so we were learning a version control system called smart something it was like i don't know i don't even know anymore but it was a vertical system that was outdated by 10 years wow it's like it wasn't yet it was it was a version control system we would not use it and all we had to do was follow instructions to like okay commit this code you know and we couldn't even get to work because it was so old and i'm just like i'm sitting in there you know and i'm saying that and i'm like like what am i doing here come on in bro come on in so what are you doing hey [Laughter] it's clean good webcam dude that's a good webcam everyone's just singing yo neil patel what's up man what's up dude i just noticed bro where where where where where dude patel neal neil patel what's the guy right here the guy in blue bro oh patel yeah i love you guys hey let's go neal yo bro robert's in the house too robert from robert from uh what's it called i mean my friend robert i mean yeah from college from college yeah yeah the guy who mentored me he's like yo let's go right here see because we were talking about him how he mentored me and he was he's watching because he watches the videos yeah yeah yeah oh my god yeah everybody look everybody's like hey now as i'm coming to visit everybody's like robert come come for a podcast it's gonna be the next episode yeah i mean here i mean no i mean online or here oh yeah he's coming to visit here at california so we'll make it live i don't know robert why are you coming by the way let me know the date let me know the date if not noz will hit you up if you're still the one [Laughter] oh we should probably wait send it to me through send it to me through slack i'll i'll i'll uh send you just like a plate for everybody okay oh in three weeks let's go [Laughter] awesome sweet sweet sweet amazing cool so um yeah like as i was saying like it was very outdated very outdated you know and yeah and i'm gonna say like obviously it's not even to generalize universities but you know like at my university where it's like a place like that you're you're not gonna have like like the purpose of university is to have people to do research not to have people to teach yes so unfortunately in some of those places you're gonna find people that just show up there and care about their research and they don't care about really teaching they're not really passionate about that correct right but but then again like in other universities like my brother he he ended up going to mit when i tell him about that experience he didn't have that experience with the single professor right really like the professor is great that's awesome i know and that that speaks again to the the level of the university right because it's like the professors there are obviously gonna be the best like some of the best in the nation in the world wow right wow so they have to be like high quality and things like that so of course there was a lot of stress a lot of pressure it was very difficult but it was like professors that cared that's good i love professional professors like that exactly in the end that's what's going to make the difference between anything right it's going to be the professors that are happy to be in that classroom whether it's virtual course whether it's a live course or whether it's recording whatever that ends up being man because that's that's what really changes so i don't know how we got in this tangent but i agree some of the stuff is outdated yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly and guys i know that you know right now what's gonna happen is we're going to get a lot be live on this podcast every single every single day um at this point i do have to jump on the meeting but when we do this podcast on a daily basis
