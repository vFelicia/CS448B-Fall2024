00:00 - so we recently dropped this video and it
00:02 - was called tailwind css in 100 seconds
00:05 - you know that was exactly modeled to be
00:07 - like fire ships but you know like a lot
00:10 - of people noted and we got a lot a lot
00:12 - of comments from people on youtube that
00:15 - it just was not acceptable what's up
00:17 - guys how's it going quasi here from
00:19 - clever programmer this is a different
00:21 - type of video i don't usually do videos
00:24 - like this but there are a couple of
00:25 - things that i believe need to be
00:28 - addressed so that's what this video is
00:31 - for so we recently dropped this video
00:33 - and it was called tailwind css in 100
00:36 - seconds a few days later fireship
00:38 - dropped his version which was tailwind
00:41 - css in 100 seconds this whole series is
00:44 - fireship's like way of doing videos he
00:47 - has a whole series called in 100 seconds
00:50 - and so we dropped one you know that was
00:53 - exactly modeled to be like fire ships
00:55 - you know we were inspired by the idea
00:58 - the title the thumbnail and then we made
01:00 - our own original content in that video
01:02 - but the parts that are really up
01:04 - and we really messed up on is we use
01:08 - pretty much the exact type of thumbnail
01:10 - that fireship uses in his videos and
01:12 - then we use the same exact title and you
01:15 - know we said in the description this
01:17 - video is inspired by farship but you
01:19 - know like a lot of people noted and we
01:21 - got a lot a lot of comments from people
01:24 - on youtube that it just was not
01:26 - acceptable you know traversing media
01:28 - commented and he was like this is sad we
01:30 - had other youtubers comment and they
01:32 - were not happy with it and of course
01:34 - fireship commented and said you know uh
01:36 - this was a very clever idea shaking my
01:38 - head most of these people you know
01:40 - especially traversing media and fireship
01:42 - are youtubers that me and my team look
01:45 - up to you know we're inspired by their
01:47 - content i think everybody in the
01:48 - community knows about them you know
01:50 - these are people that i have always you
01:53 - know looked up to in the community you
01:55 - know in the start of my journey they've
01:56 - inspired me to actually start and to you
01:59 - know learn coding and then to teach
02:01 - coding and i often find myself pointing
02:03 - people towards these channels hey go
02:06 - watch content on these platforms they
02:07 - have really good content out there and
02:09 - so you know it's not fun to read
02:12 - comments where they're upset with you
02:15 - you know i'm not gonna lie that that
02:16 - hurts and it's upsetting and you know
02:19 - rightfully so because it's a big mistake
02:22 - on our end our intention wasn't to make
02:24 - anybody upset or to piss anybody off i
02:27 - think even if the content is original i
02:29 - think it's unacceptable to kind of do
02:31 - that with a thumbnail that's really
02:33 - messed up on our part i think it's lazy
02:35 - on our part you know even if we're
02:36 - inspired we can come up with a different
02:39 - type of title we can come up with
02:41 - different type of thumbnail and i think
02:43 - that's 1 000 our fault there's no excuse
02:46 - for it for you know we've been doing
02:47 - youtube for a really long time and if i
02:49 - upset you or you know our team upset you
02:52 - like we really apologize about that and
02:54 - we don't want to lose your trust that's
02:56 - not our goal we don't take that for
02:57 - granted we take your trust very
02:59 - seriously i think that we were just not
03:01 - careful and thoughtful enough of this
03:03 - and so we kind of got what we deserve
03:06 - 100 our fault on that you know moving
03:08 - forward none of the thumbnails will be
03:10 - like that and none of the titles will be
03:12 - like that the other thing that i want to
03:14 - actually say is that i think why that's
03:16 - messed up i read somebody said in our
03:18 - comments and they said hey i thought it
03:20 - was like fire ships video that i was
03:21 - clicking and so
03:23 - the other thing would like modeling the
03:25 - thumbnail to be exactly the same as fire
03:28 - ships why that's so wrong is fire ships
03:30 - audiences uh essentially is getting
03:32 - click-baited into clicking our video
03:34 - because they're thinking it's fire ships
03:36 - video and then they're being hit with
03:37 - our video and so you know it's wrong on
03:40 - many many different levels and so that's
03:42 - why we decided to do is just like change
03:44 - the title on that video change the
03:46 - thumbnail on that video so fireship's
03:48 - audience is not confused with this stuff
03:50 - now i want to move on to the contextual
03:53 - portion of this the overall context of
03:56 - what happened why this happened in the
03:58 - first place and just give you more
04:01 - context around it while we were working
04:03 - on this video i know like nas was
04:04 - working on this video we had a bunch of
04:06 - people on from our team working on this
04:08 - video and they got together and they're
04:10 - like they're actually inspired by
04:13 - fireship you know and they were like um
04:15 - you know i remember noz would be coming
04:16 - up to me and he's like hey fireship has
04:17 - this great type of content i think we
04:20 - should have some content uh this style
04:22 - too where there's either somebody
04:23 - speaking and then there's animation over
04:26 - these videos are a little bit easier to
04:27 - make they don't take as long and they're
04:30 - valuable for people and so then he was
04:32 - like okay i'm gonna start working on
04:34 - this david started learning like
04:36 - animations and how to actually animate
04:38 - and things like that and so then we
04:39 - started adding that in post-production
04:41 - you know farship has live streams and
04:44 - videos like this online where farship is
04:46 - teaching you you know how he has his
04:49 - editing style or how he comes up with
04:50 - his videos so nasa's like this is great
04:52 - because we ourselves like nasa and i
04:54 - have watched a ton of fireship content
04:56 - we love it and so we're like okay this
04:58 - is amazing that he has content on how
05:00 - you can actually do this and how you can
05:02 - actually make videos like this so we're
05:03 - like this is so cool so now i was like
05:05 - okay i'm gonna pick a video i'm gonna
05:07 - pick a title that he hasn't done so
05:09 - we're not copying we're modeling
05:12 - something that hasn't been done so he
05:14 - picked he's like i think i'm gonna do
05:15 - tailwind because like fireship hasn't
05:17 - covered that and i'm gonna do it in a
05:18 - similar style you know then we made that
05:21 - video of course we edited it took a
05:22 - while and then once we were done editing
05:25 - it making sure the voiceover was on
05:27 - point and the animations were on point
05:29 - you know we decided to publish it and i
05:31 - didn't really think much of it to be
05:32 - honest like i just it wasn't a huge
05:35 - thing because we had just gotten done
05:36 - with running a javascript tour where we
05:38 - had 100 people in person in los angeles
05:41 - and then after that we had an event
05:43 - august 26 through 29th where we were
05:46 - doing a react intensive where we had
05:48 - people in person it was a react workshop
05:51 - so my focus was you know a lot of our
05:53 - team's focus was on that so we published
05:55 - the video we didn't take too much time
05:57 - to think about this as we're coming to
05:58 - the event on one of the first days we
06:00 - see all the comments roll in and you
06:03 - know fire ship had dropped his comment
06:04 - and he was upset and traversing media's
06:06 - comment and he was upset and then a few
06:08 - days later this is also completely not
06:11 - known to us that fireship was going to
06:13 - be dropping tailwind a couple of days
06:14 - later i had no idea you know fire ship
06:17 - dropped his tail with css which was a
06:19 - much better version than ours because we
06:21 - modeled from him so his version is like
06:23 - way better we're like holy this is
06:24 - sick and then that's what everybody in
06:26 - his comments is saying too they're like
06:28 - you can't out fire ship fire ship this
06:29 - is amazing content he's the original
06:31 - gangster and all of this is true we're
06:33 - learning from him it was crazy just so
06:35 - many people so many upvotes on these
06:37 - comments and we had no idea that this
06:39 - was gonna kind of get out of proportion
06:41 - and i saw this and i was like taking it
06:43 - back i was like this is a really big
06:44 - deal like we should actually do
06:45 - something about this so we saw this
06:47 - happen caught us by surprise but you
06:49 - know then when i was talking with nas
06:51 - i'm like we you know we were all talking
06:53 - about it and we decided that if we were
06:55 - to ever do this like we should even in
06:58 - the video reference that this idea is
07:01 - you know not just in the description say
07:03 - oh this idea was inspired by friendship
07:04 - but like in the video itself reference
07:07 - it and not use the same thumbnail not
07:09 - use the similar style of thumbnail like
07:12 - fireship and not use the same title can
07:15 - be different titles so i think a lot of
07:17 - those things they you know honestly
07:20 - there they can be really frustrating and
07:22 - upsetting for a creator because i've
07:24 - been creating on youtube for five years
07:26 - now and if that happens or when that
07:28 - happens that does go on to irk people
07:31 - and it really upsets people with that
07:32 - said you know there are a couple of
07:34 - other things i want to say i think that
07:36 - you know based on all this i don't think
07:39 - any differently of traversing media or
07:41 - fireship or any of the other content
07:43 - creators that you know said whatever
07:45 - they did on our platform because i think
07:48 - they're right in saying that and also
07:50 - when everything is online you don't know
07:53 - the other person you don't know the
07:55 - actual intent of the other person so for
07:57 - me i have no hard feelings about any of
08:00 - them just because we don't know each
08:01 - other in real life you know that's very
08:03 - very different when you know people in
08:04 - real life and not just online because
08:06 - when there's miscommunication and things
08:08 - are done online there's a lot of
08:10 - miscommunication that develops and the
08:12 - feelings of animosity are way way way
08:15 - stronger and way more amplified you know
08:17 - for example if in your relationship with
08:19 - your partner or with a friend when you
08:20 - communicate over text oftentimes fights
08:22 - and things get bigger versus when you
08:24 - meet in person it just dissolves you
08:25 - know i just extend my sincerest
08:27 - apologies if it upset anybody you know
08:29 - fire ship not gonna happen again dude
08:31 - i'm sorry this was not our goal you know
08:33 - with that said i do want to like talk
08:34 - about certain things right so when it
08:36 - comes to youtube when it comes to
08:38 - creating content there are a lot of
08:40 - channels that will model other platforms
08:43 - or other styles of videos as long as
08:45 - they don't plagiarize right and make
08:47 - their own original content so in our
08:49 - video we have completely original
08:51 - content that's not taken from anywhere
08:53 - we made the content ourselves and the
08:55 - research is our own research and you'll
08:57 - see this happen very very often right if
09:00 - you for example you've probably come
09:01 - across videos like i paid somebody on
09:03 - fiverr to make this or that you know
09:05 - peter mckinnon is doing it they're all
09:07 - these top youtubers doing it now people
09:09 - in the developer community are doing it
09:11 - so whenever there's a certain type of
09:12 - idea people will model it people will
09:15 - create those types of videos i've
09:16 - created a video before inspired by fire
09:18 - ship and you know everybody loved it we
09:21 - didn't use the same title or thumbnail
09:22 - or anything like that but that video is
09:24 - called my advice to new programmers
09:26 - number one focus on the fundamentals so
09:29 - many developers i see always trying to
09:31 - learn the hottest technology the newest
09:34 - framework the coolest thing that is
09:37 - happening around them stop and it was
09:40 - way easier to make it was way easier to
09:42 - edit i just edited literally on my
09:43 - iphone and it's just how fireship has
09:46 - his type of thing where it's like
09:48 - voiceover with animation you know i
09:49 - added all the animation i added my own
09:51 - voiceover and people really enjoyed it
09:53 - so modeling content is there will be
09:55 - like we'll drop a video like top five
09:57 - programming languages and there are a
09:59 - ton of other creators that will also
10:01 - drop similar videos and i'm not saying
10:03 - we're original in creating top five
10:04 - programming languages when you make a
10:06 - thumbnail or whatever people will start
10:08 - to make similar types of thumbnails even
10:11 - right and this is something that is
10:13 - normal um you'll start seeing videos
10:15 - like if i started coding how would i
10:16 - start all over again somebody will make
10:18 - it they'll do well and then a lot of
10:19 - people will start making that but just
10:21 - sharing it from their own experience
10:24 - from their own perspective i hate that
10:26 - this apology sounds like it has a butt
10:28 - it really doesn't i'm just trying to
10:30 - provide some context i think the thing
10:32 - that's upsetting is that there's a
10:34 - signature style of videos that fireship
10:36 - has there's a signature style of titles
10:39 - and thumbnails and i think those should
10:41 - never ever be copied because i think
10:43 - that's where the real problem comes in
10:45 - and i think that really upsets people
10:47 - but i think in terms of in the future
10:50 - our content we're planning to make a ton
10:52 - of tutorials just like we always have
10:54 - been we started doing the clones on our
10:56 - channel and then tons of people started
10:57 - doing that there's tons of channels out
10:59 - there that literally will have let's
11:01 - build a clone in blah blah blah blah and
11:04 - that was something we started april of
11:05 - 2020 and then all these channels started
11:08 - popping up and making builds you know
11:10 - going back to this our upcoming content
11:13 - is gonna be a lot more tutorial based
11:15 - and then if we drop videos like this
11:17 - we're not gonna title them the same
11:18 - we're not gonna thumbnail them the same
11:20 - way i think that's not okay but i think
11:22 - in terms of content i think that it's
11:24 - okay to make content with voiceover and
11:26 - then adding animations on top of it i
11:28 - just think that it's not cool when you
11:31 - know somebody's coming up with the whole
11:32 - series and the whole idea and then
11:34 - another creator just kind of you know
11:36 - models it to a point where essentially
11:38 - it just looks like copying so again not
11:40 - our intent it's messed up and we will
11:42 - improve we will make it better this
11:44 - won't happen again there you guys have
11:46 - it there's a lot going on on this
11:47 - channel you know on a more positive note
11:49 - there's a lot of amazing things that are
11:50 - happening we're gonna be making a ton of
11:52 - tutorials we just hit a million
11:54 - subscribers so thank you guys so much
11:57 - i'm gonna be dropping a lot more content
11:58 - or i'm gonna be dropping a video
12:00 - addressing that as well so thank you
12:02 - guys so much you know there's a lot
12:03 - that's been going on in my personal life
12:06 - and you know i hope to get you guys
12:07 - caught up on some of that stuff as well
12:09 - but i am doing a lot better now and much
12:12 - happier right now and so that puts me in
12:14 - a much better mental space to come and
12:16 - create more content because sometimes
12:18 - this youtube and algorithms and all of
12:21 - this stuff can get to you and kind of
12:22 - kill your happiness for why you started
12:24 - a lot of these things in the first place

Cleaned transcript:

so we recently dropped this video and it was called tailwind css in 100 seconds you know that was exactly modeled to be like fire ships but you know like a lot of people noted and we got a lot a lot of comments from people on youtube that it just was not acceptable what's up guys how's it going quasi here from clever programmer this is a different type of video i don't usually do videos like this but there are a couple of things that i believe need to be addressed so that's what this video is for so we recently dropped this video and it was called tailwind css in 100 seconds a few days later fireship dropped his version which was tailwind css in 100 seconds this whole series is fireship's like way of doing videos he has a whole series called in 100 seconds and so we dropped one you know that was exactly modeled to be like fire ships you know we were inspired by the idea the title the thumbnail and then we made our own original content in that video but the parts that are really up and we really messed up on is we use pretty much the exact type of thumbnail that fireship uses in his videos and then we use the same exact title and you know we said in the description this video is inspired by farship but you know like a lot of people noted and we got a lot a lot of comments from people on youtube that it just was not acceptable you know traversing media commented and he was like this is sad we had other youtubers comment and they were not happy with it and of course fireship commented and said you know uh this was a very clever idea shaking my head most of these people you know especially traversing media and fireship are youtubers that me and my team look up to you know we're inspired by their content i think everybody in the community knows about them you know these are people that i have always you know looked up to in the community you know in the start of my journey they've inspired me to actually start and to you know learn coding and then to teach coding and i often find myself pointing people towards these channels hey go watch content on these platforms they have really good content out there and so you know it's not fun to read comments where they're upset with you you know i'm not gonna lie that that hurts and it's upsetting and you know rightfully so because it's a big mistake on our end our intention wasn't to make anybody upset or to piss anybody off i think even if the content is original i think it's unacceptable to kind of do that with a thumbnail that's really messed up on our part i think it's lazy on our part you know even if we're inspired we can come up with a different type of title we can come up with different type of thumbnail and i think that's 1 000 our fault there's no excuse for it for you know we've been doing youtube for a really long time and if i upset you or you know our team upset you like we really apologize about that and we don't want to lose your trust that's not our goal we don't take that for granted we take your trust very seriously i think that we were just not careful and thoughtful enough of this and so we kind of got what we deserve 100 our fault on that you know moving forward none of the thumbnails will be like that and none of the titles will be like that the other thing that i want to actually say is that i think why that's messed up i read somebody said in our comments and they said hey i thought it was like fire ships video that i was clicking and so the other thing would like modeling the thumbnail to be exactly the same as fire ships why that's so wrong is fire ships audiences uh essentially is getting clickbaited into clicking our video because they're thinking it's fire ships video and then they're being hit with our video and so you know it's wrong on many many different levels and so that's why we decided to do is just like change the title on that video change the thumbnail on that video so fireship's audience is not confused with this stuff now i want to move on to the contextual portion of this the overall context of what happened why this happened in the first place and just give you more context around it while we were working on this video i know like nas was working on this video we had a bunch of people on from our team working on this video and they got together and they're like they're actually inspired by fireship you know and they were like um you know i remember noz would be coming up to me and he's like hey fireship has this great type of content i think we should have some content uh this style too where there's either somebody speaking and then there's animation over these videos are a little bit easier to make they don't take as long and they're valuable for people and so then he was like okay i'm gonna start working on this david started learning like animations and how to actually animate and things like that and so then we started adding that in postproduction you know farship has live streams and videos like this online where farship is teaching you you know how he has his editing style or how he comes up with his videos so nasa's like this is great because we ourselves like nasa and i have watched a ton of fireship content we love it and so we're like okay this is amazing that he has content on how you can actually do this and how you can actually make videos like this so we're like this is so cool so now i was like okay i'm gonna pick a video i'm gonna pick a title that he hasn't done so we're not copying we're modeling something that hasn't been done so he picked he's like i think i'm gonna do tailwind because like fireship hasn't covered that and i'm gonna do it in a similar style you know then we made that video of course we edited it took a while and then once we were done editing it making sure the voiceover was on point and the animations were on point you know we decided to publish it and i didn't really think much of it to be honest like i just it wasn't a huge thing because we had just gotten done with running a javascript tour where we had 100 people in person in los angeles and then after that we had an event august 26 through 29th where we were doing a react intensive where we had people in person it was a react workshop so my focus was you know a lot of our team's focus was on that so we published the video we didn't take too much time to think about this as we're coming to the event on one of the first days we see all the comments roll in and you know fire ship had dropped his comment and he was upset and traversing media's comment and he was upset and then a few days later this is also completely not known to us that fireship was going to be dropping tailwind a couple of days later i had no idea you know fire ship dropped his tail with css which was a much better version than ours because we modeled from him so his version is like way better we're like holy this is sick and then that's what everybody in his comments is saying too they're like you can't out fire ship fire ship this is amazing content he's the original gangster and all of this is true we're learning from him it was crazy just so many people so many upvotes on these comments and we had no idea that this was gonna kind of get out of proportion and i saw this and i was like taking it back i was like this is a really big deal like we should actually do something about this so we saw this happen caught us by surprise but you know then when i was talking with nas i'm like we you know we were all talking about it and we decided that if we were to ever do this like we should even in the video reference that this idea is you know not just in the description say oh this idea was inspired by friendship but like in the video itself reference it and not use the same thumbnail not use the similar style of thumbnail like fireship and not use the same title can be different titles so i think a lot of those things they you know honestly there they can be really frustrating and upsetting for a creator because i've been creating on youtube for five years now and if that happens or when that happens that does go on to irk people and it really upsets people with that said you know there are a couple of other things i want to say i think that you know based on all this i don't think any differently of traversing media or fireship or any of the other content creators that you know said whatever they did on our platform because i think they're right in saying that and also when everything is online you don't know the other person you don't know the actual intent of the other person so for me i have no hard feelings about any of them just because we don't know each other in real life you know that's very very different when you know people in real life and not just online because when there's miscommunication and things are done online there's a lot of miscommunication that develops and the feelings of animosity are way way way stronger and way more amplified you know for example if in your relationship with your partner or with a friend when you communicate over text oftentimes fights and things get bigger versus when you meet in person it just dissolves you know i just extend my sincerest apologies if it upset anybody you know fire ship not gonna happen again dude i'm sorry this was not our goal you know with that said i do want to like talk about certain things right so when it comes to youtube when it comes to creating content there are a lot of channels that will model other platforms or other styles of videos as long as they don't plagiarize right and make their own original content so in our video we have completely original content that's not taken from anywhere we made the content ourselves and the research is our own research and you'll see this happen very very often right if you for example you've probably come across videos like i paid somebody on fiverr to make this or that you know peter mckinnon is doing it they're all these top youtubers doing it now people in the developer community are doing it so whenever there's a certain type of idea people will model it people will create those types of videos i've created a video before inspired by fire ship and you know everybody loved it we didn't use the same title or thumbnail or anything like that but that video is called my advice to new programmers number one focus on the fundamentals so many developers i see always trying to learn the hottest technology the newest framework the coolest thing that is happening around them stop and it was way easier to make it was way easier to edit i just edited literally on my iphone and it's just how fireship has his type of thing where it's like voiceover with animation you know i added all the animation i added my own voiceover and people really enjoyed it so modeling content is there will be like we'll drop a video like top five programming languages and there are a ton of other creators that will also drop similar videos and i'm not saying we're original in creating top five programming languages when you make a thumbnail or whatever people will start to make similar types of thumbnails even right and this is something that is normal um you'll start seeing videos like if i started coding how would i start all over again somebody will make it they'll do well and then a lot of people will start making that but just sharing it from their own experience from their own perspective i hate that this apology sounds like it has a butt it really doesn't i'm just trying to provide some context i think the thing that's upsetting is that there's a signature style of videos that fireship has there's a signature style of titles and thumbnails and i think those should never ever be copied because i think that's where the real problem comes in and i think that really upsets people but i think in terms of in the future our content we're planning to make a ton of tutorials just like we always have been we started doing the clones on our channel and then tons of people started doing that there's tons of channels out there that literally will have let's build a clone in blah blah blah blah and that was something we started april of 2020 and then all these channels started popping up and making builds you know going back to this our upcoming content is gonna be a lot more tutorial based and then if we drop videos like this we're not gonna title them the same we're not gonna thumbnail them the same way i think that's not okay but i think in terms of content i think that it's okay to make content with voiceover and then adding animations on top of it i just think that it's not cool when you know somebody's coming up with the whole series and the whole idea and then another creator just kind of you know models it to a point where essentially it just looks like copying so again not our intent it's messed up and we will improve we will make it better this won't happen again there you guys have it there's a lot going on on this channel you know on a more positive note there's a lot of amazing things that are happening we're gonna be making a ton of tutorials we just hit a million subscribers so thank you guys so much i'm gonna be dropping a lot more content or i'm gonna be dropping a video addressing that as well so thank you guys so much you know there's a lot that's been going on in my personal life and you know i hope to get you guys caught up on some of that stuff as well but i am doing a lot better now and much happier right now and so that puts me in a much better mental space to come and create more content because sometimes this youtube and algorithms and all of this stuff can get to you and kind of kill your happiness for why you started a lot of these things in the first place that's what i'm looking forward to for all of you that love this channel i love you if you hate this channel or you've been upset by recently i still love you we're still gonna keep showing up we're young we make mistakes we're dumb we keep improving every single day we make a commitment to ourselves and to you guys to improve every single day and we'll keep showing up and we'll keep showing out that's it i love your beautiful face this is qazi and as always i'll see you in the next video you
