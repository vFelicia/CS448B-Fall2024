04:49 - ziprecruiter you can type in react.js
04:51 - and go take a look at this
04:53 - so tell me what it would be like if you
04:56 - were able to make this type of income
04:58 - even if this might not be your goal what
05:01 - would you be able to do if you were
05:02 - making a higher income as a developer if

05:06 - were making fifty thousand or seventy
05:07 - thousand or 126 thousand 000

05:13 - get okay i don't want to hear i'm just
05:15 - going to stash and keep it all for

05:20 - that money and make an impact either in
05:22 - your life or somebody else's life i want

05:53 - bit better

06:51 - countries in the world
06:55 - wow that is amazing
07:01 - travel maryland says travel real estate
07:04 - invest
07:04 - grow my business okay so basically
07:06 - maryland what it looks like is you want
07:08 - to learn the skill of coding
07:09 - so then you can take that income save
07:11 - that up and then start investing it into
07:13 - real estate so you can start developing
07:15 - passive income
07:16 - does that sound about right let me know
07:17 - in the comments
07:19 - abdul says is this salary achievable
07:22 - through
07:22 - remote job and here's the truth
07:29 - a little bit like this so we can also
07:30 - see the screen here is the truth right
07:33 - is the salary achievable
07:34 - so the answer is that yes this salary is
07:37 - achievable through a remote job and
07:39 - because of the pandemic
07:40 - most jobs are now remote jobs right
07:44 - so it doesn't matter where you are in
07:46 - the world most people are able to land
07:47 - jobs in the u.s market in the europe
07:50 - market
07:50 - it's totally doable so those salaries
07:53 - are achievable and a lot of people are
07:55 - working full-time jobs remotely
07:59 - okay maryland says yep along with
08:03 - helping out with my other industry
08:04 - fields that i work in
08:05 - great muhammad says learning to get a
08:07 - job and help my family
08:09 - okay my dream remote job that's
08:11 - natalia's dream
08:12 - so here's the thing right i'm happy that
08:15 - this is your guys's dreams i'm happy
08:17 - that
08:18 - you guys are learning these things and
08:19 - you're excited about it but what i want
08:21 - to do my job here
08:22 - is to make sure not only you're
08:25 - motivated but you
08:26 - actually put in the work to actually get
08:28 - these goals right because
08:29 - natalia we spoke with you yesterday on
08:31 - the phone you invested in lambda school
08:33 - but like you still were not able to get
08:36 - a job
08:37 - right and what they did is
08:40 - they helped you learn skills but they
08:43 - haven't done their
08:44 - job in terms of taking you all the way
08:47 - through
08:48 - to getting you a job okay so what i want
08:51 - you to be able to do natalia for example
08:53 - is keep putting in massive amount of
08:55 - effort and time and skills
08:57 - like hours okay actually like 20 to 40
08:59 - hours a week if not more
09:02 - into coding and aggressively increasing
09:04 - that skill set because
09:06 - what happens a lot now is people bring
09:08 - you in recruiters bring you in for a job
09:11 - interview
09:11 - because they see a nice portfolio
09:13 - because you might have seen
09:15 - my clone or somebody else building a
09:17 - clone or a project right
09:19 - and you might put it on your resume so
09:21 - as a recruiter i'll bring you in
09:23 - but when i bring you in and i ask you
09:25 - questions about algorithms and i ask you
09:27 - hey could you
09:27 - make a google search engine from scratch
09:30 - or could you
09:31 - write recursive fibonacci sequence and
09:33 - you
09:34 - can't answer those questions and you
09:37 - crumble under pressure
09:39 - you're never getting that job there's no
09:42 - way
09:42 - most people will laugh you out of the
09:44 - room most recruiters would
09:47 - so it's a combination of having amazing
09:50 - projects
09:51 - along with amazing technical
09:53 - interviewing skills
09:55 - is it fair like do you need to know
09:57 - those things for everyday
09:58 - job no you don't but
10:01 - did they still test you on that and do
10:04 - this still hire people based off those
10:06 - skills yes they do
10:08 - so you could choose to opt out and be
10:10 - like hey i'm not playing that game
10:11 - and just not work at those big companies
10:13 - big tech companies
10:14 - or you could be like you know what i'll
10:16 - learn and just beat them at their
10:18 - own game become a master of not only
10:20 - front-end skills but also algorithm
10:22 - skills and data structure skills
10:24 - does that make sense so really i want
10:26 - you guys to lock in those skills for
10:28 - yourself
10:29 - okay fantastic
10:33 - 406 people live man that's what i'm
10:34 - talking about usher says
10:36 - 470 let it let's go
10:39 - that's fantastic okay
10:44 - natalia says i want to beat them let's
10:46 - go hey if you want natalia to
10:48 - beat the recruiters and get a job smash
10:52 - that like button

19:27 - month long game
19:28 - if in your mind you're playing anything
19:30 - that's less than a six to ten month game
19:32 - get out of here now because it's not
19:34 - going to take less than that time
19:36 - if it does great has it happened for
19:38 - people absolutely
19:40 - but i want you to mentally be prepared
19:42 - for this
19:43 - all right six to ten month is the name
19:45 - of the game
19:47 - for your coding skills i want you to be
19:49 - thinking about putting in 40 to 20 to 40
19:51 - hours per week to learn and master these
19:54 - skills
19:54 - these are the things that are just
19:56 - required for you to
19:58 - succeed if you're unable to do these
20:00 - you're going to have a tremendously hard
20:01 - time and your timeline is going to look
20:03 - like a couple of years
20:04 - rather than 6 to ten months okay
20:07 - so this is an important thing for you to
20:09 - understand all right

36:12 - do i learn it faster guys
36:13 - the simplest thing the same thing that
36:15 - is true for learning wrestling jiu jitsu
36:17 - or dancing or biking
36:19 - it's hours on the bike it's hours on the
36:21 - mat it's
36:22 - hours on the freaking keyboard if you're
36:24 - a developer it's hours
36:27 - not only on the keyboard but also hours
36:30 - here in your brain okay so
36:32 - you type your code here but you problem
36:34 - solve here
36:35 - how many hours are you spending in here
36:37 - problem solving
36:38 - what my time looks like oftentimes when
36:40 - i'm coding is i'll code for a couple of
36:42 - hours and then i'm going for a walk
36:44 - and i'm thinking about that problem and
36:46 - solving it while i'm taking a shower
36:48 - while i'm going to bed while i'm walking
36:50 - around i'm spending
36:53 - 10 to 20 hours a day okay and
36:56 - definitely when i was trying to get a
36:57 - job in those days i was actually coding
36:59 - for 10 to 20 hours
37:00 - every [ __ ] day okay so if you really
37:03 - want to get those skills
37:05 - jacked up then it's not magic people
37:08 - think it's magic what we do
37:10 - it's not magic we take the amount of
37:12 - work that people would normally do in
37:14 - four years
37:15 - we make them do that in six months
37:19 - whether we have to [ __ ] yell at the
37:20 - people that are in their brother like
37:22 - you have to work no you got to show up
37:24 - or whether we have to do it with love
37:26 - and care and get you to come in and do
37:28 - it
37:28 - we will get you to put in 20 to 40 hours
37:31 - a week or more and you have to get
37:33 - yourself to be able to do that
37:34 - okay and you take the amount of hours
37:37 - normal people put in four years you put
37:39 - it in 10 months
37:40 - all right that's what i want for you
37:43 - clever programmer team is magical
37:45 - adrienne says that is amazing
37:47 - uh iu design asks what's my background
37:49 - music yeah what is it
37:51 - damn i don't know i actually don't know
37:53 - the name of it okay
37:55 - uh it's on epidemic sounds that's where
37:57 - i'm getting it from it's cheap
37:59 - if debbie sounds cheap i'm cheap so it
38:02 - works
38:03 - works perfectly we have already made
38:05 - amazon why again will it be different in
38:07 - some parts
38:08 - okay so that's a great question we have
38:10 - made amazon clone multiple times on this
38:12 - channel we're gonna do it again
38:15 - the number one thing that's important to
38:17 - understand
38:18 - is the whole point of the challenge is
38:19 - that you built it
38:22 - it's not so you can watch us build it
38:24 - it's so you build it
38:25 - so everybody's in the challenge
38:26 - generally they're much more engaged than
38:28 - normal people are just sitting around
38:29 - watching videos on youtube because
38:30 - they're just watching from their
38:32 - phone they're like going around the
38:34 - point of the challenge is that you
38:35 - become a part of this and you build it
38:37 - alongside us and you leave
38:38 - with your amazon project on your
38:41 - portfolio so that you can go and get a
38:42 - job does that make sense
38:44 - okay so we build it again maybe you'll
38:47 - pick up new things this time
38:48 - we might use different technologies
38:50 - times who knows we might use styled
38:52 - components or we might add in
38:54 - you know um context api or redux we
38:57 - might have something new
38:58 - okay you'll just have to come and see
39:00 - but the whole point is
39:01 - that you do it that's the point of the
39:03 - challenge not so you
39:05 - watch it you do it okay
39:08 - habiba says take my name cause it will
39:10 - influence me okay there you go your
39:12 - influence now
39:15 - um okay god and whoa aditya says got a
39:18 - 120k offered this month
39:21 - thanks a lot qazi yo that's what i'm
39:23 - talking about baby
39:31 - oh perfect thank you bro that's clutch
39:34 - let's get that going all right joe blow
39:38 - asks what does pwg complement the boot
39:41 - camp or are they completely different do
39:43 - you recommend someone in your pwj doing
39:44 - the boot camp
39:46 - so the answer is very simple okay
39:51 - boot camp is way more advanced and
39:54 - hands-on than even pwg
39:56 - is as much as we love pwj if you join
39:59 - the bootcamp
40:00 - you don't need to take pwg it could be
40:03 - there to supplement it and
40:04 - complement it but it's not necessary
40:06 - okay the bootcamp is completely
40:08 - self-inclusive
40:10 - and they're just way crazier hands-on
40:13 - training that's happening in the boot
40:14 - camp and the number one goal of the
40:16 - bootcamp is
40:17 - we literally work with you until
40:21 - you are placed at a job that's it
40:24 - okay and a lot of our students actually
40:29 - are from profit with javascript how many
40:32 - 80 80 of our students actually in the
40:34 - boot camp are from profit with
40:35 - javascript so
40:37 - yeah a lot of them are joining it so
40:40 - yeah you could look into it for sure
40:42 - but we'll talk about that on the last
40:44 - day okay the day five
40:48 - milos amazing amazing okay i'm stuck at
40:51 - redux please help
40:52 - okay so with redux right coding phoenix
40:58 - redux is a confusing thing to understand
41:01 - and grasp and put your mind around it's
41:03 - very confusing
41:04 - okay so i'll like i'll bring up the icon
41:08 - see if i can bring up the icon and show
41:10 - you guys okay
41:13 - initializing database holy crap
41:18 - all right so that's redux and that's
41:21 - what it looks like okay
41:24 - um do you have a better image of it
41:28 - save
41:31 - downloads yes save right there
41:34 - okay let's see if i can bring it up
41:38 - there we go okay very wonky way of
41:42 - getting this but
41:43 - oh we got a super chat let's go thank
41:45 - you guys for the donations always
41:46 - appreciate them
41:48 - thank you so much appreciate it just
41:50 - shows me that you guys love us okay
41:53 - um so you know i wish my mom showed me
41:56 - she loves me like this too i'd be really
41:57 - rich
41:58 - but here's redux and redux is a state
42:01 - management tool
42:03 - okay if you are using postmates or if
42:06 - you have used ubereats
42:07 - or if you have used right
42:10 - and you see that like cart items at the
42:13 - top and
42:14 - and you do a checkout and it says two
42:16 - items in cart
42:17 - and then you go back and you add in a
42:20 - new item and now it says three items
42:21 - for it to be able to do that without
42:23 - refreshing without losing that data
42:26 - if you get out of the app and you come
42:27 - back and it's still there
42:29 - that's an example of redux that's state
42:31 - management
42:33 - your app state is being managed through
42:35 - a technology called the redux okay and
42:37 - if you can understand how redux works
42:41 - you are looking to add a 10 to 20 000 a
42:44 - year boost in your salary if you deeply
42:46 - understand how redux works
42:47 - but redux takes a while to grasp your
42:50 - mind around
42:51 - so it's right something like state
42:55 - management like this
42:56 - takes some time companies that use it
42:59 - are corporations that are often times
43:01 - mid-sized
43:02 - to large-sized corporations okay if we
43:05 - can just mute that guys that'd be great
43:07 - so mid-size to large-size corporations
43:10 - use redux
43:11 - okay so a lot of it's just being used
43:14 - extensively if i take you to
43:16 - uh there's something called npm trends
43:18 - by the way which is fantastic resource
43:22 - so let me take you here right and here
43:24 - if you type in like react.js
43:26 - super popular and you'll see how many
43:28 - times react.js is being downloaded right
43:31 - is it showing me react.js or what is it
43:32 - showing me it's index
43:34 - weird all right so let's just type in
43:36 - react
43:38 - whoops all right and now you can see how
43:41 - many times react is being downloaded
43:43 - which is about
43:45 - oops which is about
43:49 - eight million times per
43:52 - uh per whatever per day or yeah like
43:55 - it's crazy number right 10 million
43:57 - downloads on february 28th
44:00 - march 7th so actually it's giving me a
44:02 - weekly number is what it seems like
44:04 - okay and every week we have 10 million
44:07 - downloads 10 million downloads
44:09 - here we had four million downloads
44:10 - because i think for new year's people
44:12 - were out partying developers
44:14 - apparently developers were out partying
44:15 - what the hell's going on here
44:17 - and now it seems like q2 is about to
44:19 - kick in and everybody's going
44:21 - ham right if you look at
44:24 - redux and if i add that in here like
44:26 - i'll add in something like material ui
44:28 - okay which is another one of um
44:30 - something really popular but like look
44:32 - material ui is like down here almost
44:34 - invisible
44:35 - super popular right but it's like
44:37 - invisible compared to react 133 download
44:39 - 1 000 downloads per week but now watch
44:41 - what happens when i add in redux look at
44:43 - this
44:45 - look at that boom redux is seeing about
44:50 - five million downloads per week
44:53 - okay so it is massive
44:57 - massive okay it's a really really
44:59 - popular technology
45:01 - so i recommend that people learn this
45:03 - but if you want to learn this make sure
45:05 - you're learning javascript
45:06 - really well first and make sure you are
45:09 - learning
45:10 - uh react really well first and then
45:14 - slowly ease your way into it and before
45:16 - you learn redux
45:17 - learn something like context api and
45:20 - then
45:20 - go all the way to redux okay so in like
45:22 - a four-step process
45:24 - all right so we go javascript
45:28 - we go react oh [ __ ]
45:32 - there we go um we go
45:37 - context api and then we go
45:41 - redux hey
45:44 - thank you new donation vanessa i
45:46 - appreciate you so much thank you
45:50 - so i hope that this makes sense for you
45:52 - guys okay
45:54 - all right we got a photo
45:59 - okay let's see this photo here
46:03 - uh lexi crawford says what if we are in
46:06 - a boot camp already
46:07 - what do you recommend i really want to
46:10 - work with you all
46:11 - that's a fantastic question lexi that is
46:14 - amazing
46:15 - definitely if you want you can uh book a
46:18 - call with us and we can talk to you and
46:19 - we can figure something out
46:20 - but essentially what that looks like
46:22 - it's not a problem at all most of our
46:23 - students have
46:24 - are either have gone to a boot camp
46:26 - previously
46:28 - you know universities or some students
46:30 - were in boot camps or in universities
46:32 - and then decided to
46:33 - join our program if we speak with you
46:37 - it would be very simple but just figure
46:39 - out what's the best solution for you if
46:40 - it's you stay in your current boot camp
46:42 - you can choose to do that
46:43 - or if it's this sounds like a good
46:45 - option we can talk to you about that
46:46 - okay
46:47 - so if you're interested by the way what
46:49 - you can do is
46:50 - um i'll put up a number
46:54 - for you okay and
46:58 - just this is the number okay
47:05 - so you can just text me here all right
47:07 - you can text me here this is my phone
47:09 - number
47:10 - and you can say bootcamp
47:14 - and then i can just chat with you from
47:15 - there okay so just text me that
47:18 - if you're interested and you want to
47:19 - talk about it lexi text me bootcamp and
47:21 - then we'll go from there
47:23 - okay hope that makes sense if any of you
47:25 - guys are interested too
47:26 - you can do the same thing that's all
47:28 - good all right
47:30 - beautiful moving on great questions guys

53:25 - uh this challenge yes it will be
53:27 - definitely watchable later for sure
53:29 - okay
53:33 - yes great question uh reshadow says
53:37 - quasi
53:38 - react or view or django and why i think
53:41 - they're all
53:42 - fantastic
53:45 - but you have to think about why you're
53:46 - learning them if you're in the python
53:48 - world
53:48 - i think it makes ton of sense to learn
53:50 - django
53:51 - right if you're in the javascript world
53:53 - i think it makes a ton of sense to
53:55 - learn react okay so i like vue as well
53:59 - but i think
54:00 - react is the way to go and it's one of
54:02 - the most popular
54:03 - and i like it way better than view okay
54:06 - so
54:06 - go with react and look even if you're
54:09 - doing python or something else
54:10 - you can just whip up an api and still
54:14 - use javascript and react and then have
54:16 - python slash django for your back end
54:18 - so if you wanna go hard on front end and
54:21 - become good
54:22 - i would say like learn learn react
54:25 - learn and learn it well i sent you a
54:28 - message
54:31 - is your wardrobe full of soccer kids yes
54:33 - i love soccer bro
54:44 - if i want to join the program boot camp
54:47 - what are the prerequisites so
54:49 - uh for the boot camp couple of
54:51 - prerequisites
54:52 - are you need a computer
54:56 - you need internet you need
54:59 - to um you need to be able to
55:03 - put in at least 20 to 40 hours per week
55:06 - minimum if you can't do that don't join
55:08 - our programs
55:13 - you need to be excited about coding okay
55:15 - and you need to understand that things
55:16 - take six to ten months okay
55:18 - those are a couple of really important
55:20 - things to understand okay
55:21 - uh there is a financial investment to be
55:23 - able to join the boot camp
55:26 - somebody just did a 20 donation let's
55:33 - on go he said that
55:37 - let's go that is amazing on
55:40 - thank you for the 20 donation
55:44 - and he goes clever programmer is the
55:45 - best on is the guy we're talking about
55:47 - guys who landed a job as a developer so

Cleaned transcript:

opportunity to become a react js developer and while i was waiting and my internet was down because you know this we're apparently not paying enough to get internet here so it's fine but while i was waiting i decided to play a game of chess and then it got me thinking hey while chess is fun and i'm able to play online this still requires you to know web development in order to be able to do this and play right so that was super exciting but if you guys ever want to challenge me in chess you're welcome too let's get back to what we were talking about okay we're starting to get people back live on here again which is exciting i'm gonna hit refresh and see uh which one of you guys are on let's click right there boom we have 99 people live amazing we got brian redding what is up brian amazing jessica is back hi welcome to the challenge react.js challenge guys i'm excited to have you back here and like what i was saying in the first stream and then the second stream that got disconnected is your ability to get paid as a developer is based on you turning this right code into an app like this app okay if you have this ability and you can do this people are willing to pay you for it okay so welcome back jessica hi camera focus is off ooh nice good catch man i should hire one of you guys all right hopefully that's better brilliant taran sharma says keep up the good work thank you thank you thank you colin says yo man what is up learning a lot from your challenges absolutely fantastic and i'm glad that you guys are able to now let me ask you guys what is more important to you right so i asked you guys what's more important to you and a lot of you guys told me hey creativity is more important to me the ability to learn how to code freedom now i want you to tell me what is that income that you're looking for when you want to become a developer right so as important as of course other things are like you just being able to code you still want to be able to make an income from it right for me it was always about can i help my family and friends with this can i do things like book a airbnb and not have to worry and be able to go with my friends for me it was about can i pay something for my parents and not have to worry about that can i travel without always having to worry so if you were to get a job what is it that you know what's the income level that you're looking for write that in the comments below and the more specific you are right the more likely it is that that might be a possibility for you so some of you might be like hey i think i'll be happy with 20 000 in a year great some of you might be like i'll be happy with 80 000 a year as my first job as a full stack developer write that down below and let me know and i want to read what you guys got to say about it let me open up my chat again boom oh we got a lot of natalia says six digits that's fantastic daniel gallo says 70 000 to 90 000. my urgent says more than 70k tech goat says 150 000 a year surya says a hundred and thirty thousand david david says a hundred k eventually that's fantastic okay we have benny here saying a hundred thousand limar says what's enough to not be worried about money again abhishek says 80k would be perfect gotta get paid for something i love so you see everybody has different goals that they're trying to hit now don't let don't let other people force you into a goal right maybe if you're happy with the lower amount of income per year that's totally fine it's what's good for you and what would you be happy with if you go above that then fantastic all right so i am super excited to see these goals from you guys and thank you guys for sharing them now what i want to do is let's go here and let's take a look at the actual salaries that react.js developers are getting paid do you guys want to see them do you do you should i show you all right let's do it so the actual salaries the react developers are getting paid this is los angeles right now to where i'm at is about 126 000 per year okay so pretty freaking awesome but keep in mind that in different states it's going to be different but this is majority of the jobs right are are right here and this is according to ziprecruiter you can type in react.js and go take a look at this so tell me what it would be like if you were able to make this type of income even if this might not be your goal what would you be able to do if you were making a higher income as a developer if you were making i don't know like if you were making fifty thousand or seventy thousand or 126 thousand 000 a year what would that allow you to do what would you do with that money that you get okay i don't want to hear i'm just going to stash and keep it all for myself that's great but would you actually take that money and make an impact either in your life or somebody else's life i want to see it what would that look like okay let's see we have people saying okay the camera is blurry could somebody please sit down next to the camera and just keep making sure it's good okay so we have james says go live in dubai fantastic okay so it's not just because of the white screen but you can actually change the polarizer a little bit and that should be a little bit better pay off my parents house okay great okay uh nas can you actually help me with this bro no if you could help me with this the polarizer and everything all right invest adam says invest great nikhil says start a business alexis carr says invest invest invest fantastic okay scott dancer says get out of the restaurant industry so scott are you currently in service industry and what's your current job right now okay vest goat says i love you man i love you too man that's fantastic thank you for sharing that that is so cool all right we have people saying buy whatever i want gift dad mercedes that's a fantastic goal brandon says invest in tesla matthews jose says travel to all countries in the world wow that is amazing travel maryland says travel real estate invest grow my business okay so basically maryland what it looks like is you want to learn the skill of coding so then you can take that income save that up and then start investing it into real estate so you can start developing passive income does that sound about right let me know in the comments abdul says is this salary achievable through remote job and here's the truth a little bit like this so we can also see the screen here is the truth right is the salary achievable so the answer is that yes this salary is achievable through a remote job and because of the pandemic most jobs are now remote jobs right so it doesn't matter where you are in the world most people are able to land jobs in the u.s market in the europe market it's totally doable so those salaries are achievable and a lot of people are working fulltime jobs remotely okay maryland says yep along with helping out with my other industry fields that i work in great muhammad says learning to get a job and help my family okay my dream remote job that's natalia's dream so here's the thing right i'm happy that this is your guys's dreams i'm happy that you guys are learning these things and you're excited about it but what i want to do my job here is to make sure not only you're motivated but you actually put in the work to actually get these goals right because natalia we spoke with you yesterday on the phone you invested in lambda school but like you still were not able to get a job right and what they did is they helped you learn skills but they haven't done their job in terms of taking you all the way through to getting you a job okay so what i want you to be able to do natalia for example is keep putting in massive amount of effort and time and skills like hours okay actually like 20 to 40 hours a week if not more into coding and aggressively increasing that skill set because what happens a lot now is people bring you in recruiters bring you in for a job interview because they see a nice portfolio because you might have seen my clone or somebody else building a clone or a project right and you might put it on your resume so as a recruiter i'll bring you in but when i bring you in and i ask you questions about algorithms and i ask you hey could you make a google search engine from scratch or could you write recursive fibonacci sequence and you can't answer those questions and you crumble under pressure you're never getting that job there's no way most people will laugh you out of the room most recruiters would so it's a combination of having amazing projects along with amazing technical interviewing skills is it fair like do you need to know those things for everyday job no you don't but did they still test you on that and do this still hire people based off those skills yes they do so you could choose to opt out and be like hey i'm not playing that game and just not work at those big companies big tech companies or you could be like you know what i'll learn and just beat them at their own game become a master of not only frontend skills but also algorithm skills and data structure skills does that make sense so really i want you guys to lock in those skills for yourself okay fantastic 406 people live man that's what i'm talking about usher says 470 let it let's go that's fantastic okay natalia says i want to beat them let's go hey if you want natalia to beat the recruiters and get a job smash that like button break that [ __ ] let's get this video out there guys this is the best community ever i'm so excited to be here with you guys and thank you for sharing your energy pronounce pranav says a hundred percent agree with you guys to hear says hello quasi shout out please there is your shout out there you go brother lily says let's go let's go guys i'm reading everybody's 500 people guys let's go hey hey all right we got maryland in here thank you for coming back marilyn you guys are dedicated you guys are freaking dedicated man two live streams disconnected and maryland still comes back that tells me maryland wants this [ __ ] and she wants to [ __ ] crush it i love it deviant says natalya op yeah anthony woo okay awesome so now let me tell you guys something okay let me tell you guys what's gonna be happening in here all right let me tell you the game plan okay here we go game plan time baby um so i hope you guys can see the screen and please team cp confirm for me that on youtube they're able to see this when they are i assume that they will be able to see it okay so right now you might be here and you need to get a job as a developer okay you want to get that dream job where you're making good income and right now you are either unemployed making zero or you have a job in a field that you don't like all right so we don't need to do that why are we doing that does it look very dark yeah but it's about the white board okay okay got it awesome so what happens with most people right is they're going instead of going in a straight line from point a to point b and getting that job most people are going i'm gonna learn about i'm gonna learn about c plus plus and then i'm gonna learn javascript and then i'm gonna learn graphql and next.js and we like all over the place right and you're just stuck this is called a tutorial hell and people get stuck in it you might be able to identify with this right not making forward progress not feeling like hey i don't think i'm getting closer to where i want to get to i don't want that to happen to you i want you guys to go straight line as much straight line as possible okay do you guys want to go in a straight line to getting your dream job as a developer yes or no drop it in the comments let me know okay oh here we go it's okay you guys can just tell me i'll hear you thank you bro i appreciate you all right so straight liners all right all my straight liners who want to achieve this in a straight line now go udemy course udacity course youtube tutorial stuck okay i don't want that for you i want that straight line so here's what that straight line is going to be looking like in the next five days that's what we're doing here on this challenge are you guys excited are you guys excited about this five day challenge that we're doing i hope that you are my beautiful person so today is day one all right tomorrow will be day two today after that you guessed it will be day three and then we got day four and then the last day is day five okay now here's what's going to be happening here's the road map here's the game plan day one which is today i'm here to talk to you about the opportunity is this possible for you can you do it can a beginner do it blah blah blah the simple answer is i don't care if you are a beginner or an expert you can do this and it's possible for you okay we've had people who are driving an uber driving a truck come into our programs learn and they have jobs within a couple of months or within a year all right so it's a very doable process just today i got a yesterday i got a call or a text message from one of our students his name is on and he told us he just got a job offer at gravity for uh 70 000 a year okay keep in mind he's never had a coding job before and the job that he on had before this on was making 20 000 and what was his job frankie do you know using [ __ ] postmates from postmates making 20k to this okay postmates is food delivery okay so imagine that jump and now he's a developer and it's crazy which is so exciting me and frankie started crying when we heard this okay it was so awesome and we want that same result for you guys do you want that same result i hope that you do let me know in the comments to their sentiment who was the same result all right so day one is gonna be the opportunity i'm here to share with you what's possible okay day two day three and day four these three days here okay we're gonna be building the amazon clone from scratch who's excited about building amazon let's go brandon says me beautiful anthony nice fantastic so who is excited about building a react js right learning these technologies and building a store like amazon okay and you will be learning the entire tech stack that's out there okay so that means you'll be learning you can just keep spinning it like really aggressively until you see me and if you don't then it's okay just skip it okay that's all good all good all good all good so you're gonna be learning technologies right in these days like react okay uh let me type it because my handwriting is trash you're gonna be learning react.js you're gonna be mastering javascript you'll be mastering redux okay redux for you guys and take notes do you guys have a notebook and a pen if you don't now is the time get up run get something to write with because i want you to get tremendous amount of value out of this okay and you guys can tag me on instagram too by the way if you can you you can make a story and tag me at and that would be dope i'll reply to pretty much everybody if you post uh re reshare your story and mention me in it okay so you're gonna be mastering state management tool like redux this is really important for you to learn for most big companies they're using technologies like these all right javascript react.js of course you'll be going through html you'll learn html and css as well okay now one thing i want you to keep in mind okay this amazon clone project that you're gonna be building from scratch it's more to show you the power of coding and to have you get a project on your portfolio that's the crazy thing about this we're gonna be putting this straight up on your portfolio okay would that be exciting and valuable for you that you have a project of this caliber and this size on your portfolio i hope that it is okay and it has been proven to get people jobs and we're also going to give you a portfolio on this live stream or for tonight's homework in the challenge if you're not in the challenge make sure you uh click and opt in and sign up can we put the link to the challenge in the description of the video yes so people can opt in to the challenge all right if you're in the challenge then you have the possibility of winning the challenge you also have the possibility of getting communication from us and homework and assignments and portfolios okay and the code that we do with react and amazon will also be able to send you that too okay so that's why it matters for you to opt in to the challenge okay so these are the projects you're going to be learning now keep in mind guys this [ __ ] is hard okay so i'm gonna write that here can i make a poop emoji here no i can't 600 people live 600 people live let's go baby that's how we do let's go guys smash that like button if you're enjoying this just break that thing break that thing break that thing beautiful so keep in mind guys this is hard and it takes a ton of time and ton of energy so i want you to be playing a six to ten month long game if in your mind you're playing anything that's less than a six to ten month game get out of here now because it's not going to take less than that time if it does great has it happened for people absolutely but i want you to mentally be prepared for this all right six to ten month is the name of the game for your coding skills i want you to be thinking about putting in 40 to 20 to 40 hours per week to learn and master these skills these are the things that are just required for you to succeed if you're unable to do these you're going to have a tremendously hard time and your timeline is going to look like a couple of years rather than 6 to ten months okay so this is an important thing for you to understand all right now the challenge i wanna set your expectations the challenge is gonna kick your ass you are going to be confused tomorrow you're going to be showing up you're going to be like i don't know what's happening and freaking out now is not the time to freak out okay what we're going to be showing you is some advanced stuff so of course it's going to be like scary right we're not just being like hey let's make tictactoe do you guys want to make tictactoe do you guys want to make the amazon clone so if you're going to make amazon clone of course it's going to be hard so if you're a complete beginner who has very little idea of coding try to keep up with us starting tomorrow but if you can't look we have the videos ready so you can watch them at your own pace just chill and watch pay attention lock out your doors and pay attention watch closely nas is going to be training you he's taught thousands and thousands of students how to make this amazon project from scratch so we're going to be there training you showing you every single thing so just relax chill have fun and learn pay attention if you feel like you're falling behind it's okay it's a normal thing to feel okay normal to feel okay this is just me setting expectations all right i'm not trying to scare you off it's just me telling you that this is the hard work that's required would you rather me be honest with you or would you rather me just tell you all the positive stuff and just that's it right so i'm trying to be honest with you okay this is actually what it will take so make sure that when you show up you're doing the coding but if you fall behind or you're confused hey what's redux what's this what's this what's this it's okay breathe relax chill you'll be good okay so it's really important that's what's gonna be happening on day two day three and day four okay building this amazon clone now on day five we have something really special for you okay day five we're gonna be giving you your exact road map on how you can be making 100k a year as a developer okay it's your roadmap for some people this road map might take 10 freaking years but for some it might take 12 months we're going to give you this road map so when you leave on day 5 you have the exact stepbystep plan for how you can make six figures or more would that be valuable for you guys yes or no i hope it is okay i can't see the chat right now i'll get out of this and i'll look at the chat and i'm actually you know what i'll just look at the chat right now boom quasi keep it real i love it okay awesome yeah marilyn says let's keep this relationship lies free you got it okay cannon says balls to the walls baby honesty is the best policy honest all the way boom there we go fantastic okay um rewatching videos helps you if you don't completely understand english that's true as well due to the subtitles okay so just keep that in mind you know if you completely don't understand english you have trouble with it all good watch it again all right so all of this is to set realistic expectations okay so that's what happens on day five and day five we're also going to be announcing we are so freaking excited we just launched our brand new coding bootcamp and it's called full stack mastery okay let me write that here full stack mastery okay boot camp oh my bad okay let me remove that thank you for letting me know so that's the program that we just launched we are so freaking excited to share this with you guys we're going to be talking about it that's the program on was in where he got

want to answer those as well today okay so then when you go in tomorrow you're completely prepared okay so uh poen asks what is the challenge so i was explaining what the challenge is okay i showed you guys earlier but it's a five day challenge it starts today and ends on sunday okay you guys are gonna build the amazon project from scratch all right let me ask you guys if you know about the pro about this challenge okay so what are we gonna do in this five day challenge let me know in the comments below and they'll also help out some of the people who are confused nisha says going to grab a 100k job soon on a way towards it your videos have helped a ton that is sick i love it i love it um working on a challenge massimo says what is pwj pwj is our program profit with javascript okay that's our program where we teach you how to become a developer um it's currently we're not taking any new students right now but we'll talk about it probably at some point later okay uh we'll get into bezos family baby yeah we have a developer who is part of the bezos family he's working at blue origin okay awesome now people are asking hey marwan says you have not said my name bro okay i'll say it so a lot of people are asking hey how do i become a java react.js developer how do i learn it faster guys the simplest thing the same thing that is true for learning wrestling jiu jitsu or dancing or biking it's hours on the bike it's hours on the mat it's hours on the freaking keyboard if you're a developer it's hours not only on the keyboard but also hours here in your brain okay so you type your code here but you problem solve here how many hours are you spending in here problem solving what my time looks like oftentimes when i'm coding is i'll code for a couple of hours and then i'm going for a walk and i'm thinking about that problem and solving it while i'm taking a shower while i'm going to bed while i'm walking around i'm spending 10 to 20 hours a day okay and definitely when i was trying to get a job in those days i was actually coding for 10 to 20 hours every [ __ ] day okay so if you really want to get those skills jacked up then it's not magic people think it's magic what we do it's not magic we take the amount of work that people would normally do in four years we make them do that in six months whether we have to [ __ ] yell at the people that are in their brother like you have to work no you got to show up or whether we have to do it with love and care and get you to come in and do it we will get you to put in 20 to 40 hours a week or more and you have to get yourself to be able to do that okay and you take the amount of hours normal people put in four years you put it in 10 months all right that's what i want for you clever programmer team is magical adrienne says that is amazing uh iu design asks what's my background music yeah what is it damn i don't know i actually don't know the name of it okay uh it's on epidemic sounds that's where i'm getting it from it's cheap if debbie sounds cheap i'm cheap so it works works perfectly we have already made amazon why again will it be different in some parts okay so that's a great question we have made amazon clone multiple times on this channel we're gonna do it again the number one thing that's important to understand is the whole point of the challenge is that you built it it's not so you can watch us build it it's so you build it so everybody's in the challenge generally they're much more engaged than normal people are just sitting around watching videos on youtube because they're just watching from their phone they're like going around the point of the challenge is that you become a part of this and you build it alongside us and you leave with your amazon project on your portfolio so that you can go and get a job does that make sense okay so we build it again maybe you'll pick up new things this time we might use different technologies times who knows we might use styled components or we might add in you know um context api or redux we might have something new okay you'll just have to come and see but the whole point is that you do it that's the point of the challenge not so you watch it you do it okay habiba says take my name cause it will influence me okay there you go your influence now um okay god and whoa aditya says got a 120k offered this month thanks a lot qazi yo that's what i'm talking about baby oh perfect thank you bro that's clutch let's get that going all right joe blow asks what does pwg complement the boot camp or are they completely different do you recommend someone in your pwj doing the boot camp so the answer is very simple okay boot camp is way more advanced and handson than even pwg is as much as we love pwj if you join the bootcamp you don't need to take pwg it could be there to supplement it and complement it but it's not necessary okay the bootcamp is completely selfinclusive and they're just way crazier handson training that's happening in the boot camp and the number one goal of the bootcamp is we literally work with you until you are placed at a job that's it okay and a lot of our students actually are from profit with javascript how many 80 80 of our students actually in the boot camp are from profit with javascript so yeah a lot of them are joining it so yeah you could look into it for sure but we'll talk about that on the last day okay the day five milos amazing amazing okay i'm stuck at redux please help okay so with redux right coding phoenix redux is a confusing thing to understand and grasp and put your mind around it's very confusing okay so i'll like i'll bring up the icon see if i can bring up the icon and show you guys okay initializing database holy crap all right so that's redux and that's what it looks like okay um do you have a better image of it save downloads yes save right there okay let's see if i can bring it up there we go okay very wonky way of getting this but oh we got a super chat let's go thank you guys for the donations always appreciate them thank you so much appreciate it just shows me that you guys love us okay um so you know i wish my mom showed me she loves me like this too i'd be really rich but here's redux and redux is a state management tool okay if you are using postmates or if you have used ubereats or if you have used right and you see that like cart items at the top and and you do a checkout and it says two items in cart and then you go back and you add in a new item and now it says three items for it to be able to do that without refreshing without losing that data if you get out of the app and you come back and it's still there that's an example of redux that's state management your app state is being managed through a technology called the redux okay and if you can understand how redux works you are looking to add a 10 to 20 000 a year boost in your salary if you deeply understand how redux works but redux takes a while to grasp your mind around so it's right something like state management like this takes some time companies that use it are corporations that are often times midsized to largesized corporations okay if we can just mute that guys that'd be great so midsize to largesize corporations use redux okay so a lot of it's just being used extensively if i take you to uh there's something called npm trends by the way which is fantastic resource so let me take you here right and here if you type in like react.js super popular and you'll see how many times react.js is being downloaded right is it showing me react.js or what is it showing me it's index weird all right so let's just type in react whoops all right and now you can see how many times react is being downloaded which is about oops which is about eight million times per uh per whatever per day or yeah like it's crazy number right 10 million downloads on february 28th march 7th so actually it's giving me a weekly number is what it seems like okay and every week we have 10 million downloads 10 million downloads here we had four million downloads because i think for new year's people were out partying developers apparently developers were out partying what the hell's going on here and now it seems like q2 is about to kick in and everybody's going ham right if you look at redux and if i add that in here like i'll add in something like material ui okay which is another one of um something really popular but like look material ui is like down here almost invisible super popular right but it's like invisible compared to react 133 download 1 000 downloads per week but now watch what happens when i add in redux look at this look at that boom redux is seeing about five million downloads per week okay so it is massive massive okay it's a really really popular technology so i recommend that people learn this but if you want to learn this make sure you're learning javascript really well first and make sure you are learning uh react really well first and then slowly ease your way into it and before you learn redux learn something like context api and then go all the way to redux okay so in like a fourstep process all right so we go javascript we go react oh [ __ ] there we go um we go context api and then we go redux hey thank you new donation vanessa i appreciate you so much thank you so i hope that this makes sense for you guys okay all right we got a photo okay let's see this photo here uh lexi crawford says what if we are in a boot camp already what do you recommend i really want to work with you all that's a fantastic question lexi that is amazing definitely if you want you can uh book a call with us and we can talk to you and we can figure something out but essentially what that looks like it's not a problem at all most of our students have are either have gone to a boot camp previously you know universities or some students were in boot camps or in universities and then decided to join our program if we speak with you it would be very simple but just figure out what's the best solution for you if it's you stay in your current boot camp you can choose to do that or if it's this sounds like a good option we can talk to you about that okay so if you're interested by the way what you can do is um i'll put up a number for you okay and just this is the number okay so you can just text me here all right you can text me here this is my phone number and you can say bootcamp and then i can just chat with you from there okay so just text me that if you're interested and you want to talk about it lexi text me bootcamp and then we'll go from there okay hope that makes sense if any of you guys are interested too you can do the same thing that's all good all right beautiful moving on great questions guys fantastic questions all right man the setup is so dope it's so cool i love it all right going back all right let me open this all right so sampada says what's the agenda for today the agenda for today is very simple it's to show you the opportunity for becoming a developer which i did in the start okay how much salary does the developer make let me ask you guys what's the average salary of a developer in us okay drop that in the comments below if you know the answer let everybody know okay and then tomorrow i shared with you guys tomorrow is when we're really cranking it up and you guys are building the amazon clone from scratch okay and you guys will receive a homework tonight as well keep an eye out on your email because you're gonna receive your homework from the email that we have of yours okay so we're gonna send you the portfolio okay and we'll let you know what you need to do to prepare for tomorrow so a couple of things you guys might need by the way for tomorrow it's not necessary but it is helpful if you guys get these uh figured out so make sure that you have uh via something like vs code uh installed oh my goodness yeah that's perfect installed on your computer okay right uh see if you can get node.js installed uh react no that's fine that's fine yeah okay those are the only two things that's it if you have these two things you're pretty good to go and uh do we bother them with git or no thing is no them say that they're going to an event i sent you a facebook link just show to them that they should go to the events page and they should say go until they are reminded by about tomorrow's live call okay so i'll show you guys something right now all right so where is that events okay okay so you guys got that this is what you need to do okay let me get out of here and let's get out of there you guys need to go here upcoming events in the facebook group and make sure that you say going all right those are happening uh this is today tomorrow the day after that the day after that last event is on sunday all right so make sure that you're saying going right over here okay let me know once you guys are done doing that do we drop that in the chat in the facebook group yeah if we could drop it in chat i think that would be fantastic so everybody could see it but we're going to drop it in the chat and then maybe in the description of the youtube video as well yeah you know but make sure you guys do it and then let me know drop it in the comments if you've done it and let's go from there folks okay drone pilots is going scott dancers is going fantastic conrad says done beautiful beautiful beautiful you guys are like super on top of it great yeah um brandon says npm i create react app or building react from scratch you're going to be using uh create react app yes and we're not going to be learning about babel and webpack we're not going to be going so deep into that okay who somebody told their entire school about this challenge that's amazing otabek says i joined now where should i give my email so the email is going to be can you send me a link for the optin page now yeah i'll share with everybody it's in the description below otabek so you can go there and sign up as well okay oh marilyn yeah just finished sharing the challenge to my entire school so excited about this challenge absolutely amazing that is exciting uh otabek says it says unavailable content isn't available right now that's what it keeps saying to everybody because maybe you guys haven't joined the facebook group so you need to join the facebook group first okay so the way you do that is by going through this link here okay so the link is in description below and you can go here all right so go to this page and sign up okay once you sign up here boom you can get inside of this challenge you will have your email we'll be able to send you all the stuff you'll officially be part of this challenge and you'll be able to on the next page you'll see facebook just join the facebook group from there on the next page it'll tell you what you need to do just go ahead and do all of that okay so for example you'll click register and once you click register it'll tell you thank you for signing up for the challenge right and then join the facebook group that's how you're going to join it text me here say jschallenge and then join the discord community as well become a part of our family all right let's get out of there beautiful that's funny uh i'm using something called screen brush okay and that allows me to be able to write on top of my screen that's what it is uh this challenge yes it will be definitely watchable later for sure okay yes great question uh reshadow says quasi react or view or django and why i think they're all fantastic but you have to think about why you're learning them if you're in the python world i think it makes ton of sense to learn django right if you're in the javascript world i think it makes a ton of sense to learn react okay so i like vue as well but i think react is the way to go and it's one of the most popular and i like it way better than view okay so go with react and look even if you're doing python or something else you can just whip up an api and still use javascript and react and then have python slash django for your back end so if you wanna go hard on front end and become good i would say like learn learn react learn and learn it well i sent you a message is your wardrobe full of soccer kids yes i love soccer bro if i want to join the program boot camp what are the prerequisites so uh for the boot camp couple of prerequisites are you need a computer you need internet you need to um you need to be able to put in at least 20 to
