02:31 - which are blue origin google and
02:33 - microsoft
02:34 - and because of my awesome resume i was
02:36 - able to land an interview
02:38 - and actually because of the interviewing
02:40 - skills i was able to land the job
02:42 - so what we're going to try to teach you
02:44 - at least for my site is offer my
02:46 - perspective my advice to be able to get
02:48 - you
02:49 - those awesome resumes you could start to
02:51 - build that will then allow you
02:53 - to then land the amazing interviews and
02:56 - then all these other awesome
02:58 - yeah all these other companies that
03:00 - you're going to see right here
03:01 - this is obviously not because nod knows
03:03 - exactly what he's doing
03:05 - he did a lot of work as a freelancer and
03:07 - he got to work with a lot of companies
03:08 - so he got to interview at twitter
03:11 - palantir
03:12 - squarespace and microsoft as well so i'm
03:15 - not i just let them know why all these
03:16 - companies are here basically
03:18 - we've gone through the interview
03:19 - processes of all these different
03:21 - companies and it was
03:22 - our resumes that allowed us to get into
03:24 - that step at least yes
03:26 - exactly all these resumes right we were
03:27 - able i was able to get interviews with
03:29 - companies like square
03:30 - you know squarespace volunteer twitter
03:32 - you know google as well and then you
03:34 - know same thing something here
03:35 - same same thing here with with daniel
03:38 - and what we did is
03:39 - we what was interesting is our resumes
03:42 - were reviewed
03:42 - by amazing people you know you know we
03:45 - learned
03:46 - we learned from from other people right
03:50 - you know other people that were already
03:52 - working exactly like those companies
03:53 - they were working at those companies
03:55 - that is why we are here to transfer that
03:57 - knowledge to
03:58 - you okay to you exactly so let's go
04:00 - ahead and get started let's go next up
04:02 - why building a strong resume is
04:04 - important most companies don't even
04:06 - go ahead oh i'm just gonna say it's
04:09 - important because
04:10 - i mean how else do they know who you are
04:12 - right it's like no one knows who you are
04:14 - in this world especially if you're
04:15 - trying to get a job unless you have some
04:17 - sort of paper
04:18 - maybe that's only one page long that
04:20 - summarizes
04:21 - what you've done specifically so go
04:24 - ahead and get into what you're gonna do
04:25 - yeah yeah yeah of course you need to
04:26 - stand out from the crowd that's number
04:27 - one right
04:28 - because you have hundreds of thousands
04:29 - of developers applying every single day
04:31 - so how do you stand out the crowd how do
04:33 - you as that you know the particular
04:35 - person who
04:36 - has got all that knowledge and has got
04:37 - all the experience how do you do that
04:39 - how do you stand out
04:40 - and so that is why you got to send out
04:42 - with at least something like your resume
04:44 - your projects of course and of course of
04:47 - course
04:47 - your resume correct so that's what we're
04:50 - here to teach you how to stand
04:51 - how do you stand out so of course the
04:54 - first thing you need to
04:55 - talk about or you need to know is the
04:56 - sections on you know that you need to
04:58 - have in your resume
04:59 - very important daniel because i want to
05:02 - just notice this
05:03 - how many pages does a resume need to
05:06 - have
05:07 - um i don't know nas this is a really
05:09 - tough one come on girl come on bro you
05:11 - got this come on
05:12 - you got this come on come on come on you
05:14 - got this i think it's one i think it's
05:15 - the one
05:20 - let's go
05:24 - so guys you need to have you need you
05:26 - need one page only honestly please
05:28 - because i i receive all these resumes
05:30 - from you guys and it's like 10 pages
05:31 - okay
05:32 - no please keep it to one that is all you
05:35 - need all right
05:36 - that is all my friends that you need so
05:38 - also
05:39 - awesome so let's keep going so the
05:41 - sections okay some what let's go ahead
05:43 - and go through some of the sections that
05:44 - you need
05:44 - tell me uh here uh daniel
05:48 - perfect perfect so honestly depending on
05:51 - what experience you have you're going to
05:53 - want to highlight
05:53 - different ones right so as you can see
05:56 - these different sections to be honest
05:58 - if you don't have work experience being
06:00 - a developer before
06:01 - then that's not what you want to
06:02 - highlight instead you're going to want
06:04 - to highlight potentially your projects
06:06 - or your awards that you've shown you've
06:08 - been able to build something something
06:10 - of value
06:10 - that you actually develop sort of
06:12 - software and it's applicable
06:13 - to the job but it's still important to
06:15 - have these different sections so that
06:17 - when someone looks at your resume
06:18 - they could easily find what they're
06:20 - looking for oh
06:21 - salman salman someone just donated

06:52 - value we will more than happily put you
06:54 - in front of
06:55 - everyone because you're gonna add value

07:02 - take advantage of that
07:03 - go ahead go through series probably
07:05 - awesome yeah so put your link down below
07:06 - and then i think we should be all good
07:08 - awesome so thanks so much salman
07:10 - let's go ahead and keep going we'll give
07:11 - you an edge here
07:13 - [Music]
07:14 - all all right all right bro all right
07:19 - all right so cool let's go ahead and
07:20 - keep going next up so you got
07:22 - awards you got next time of course you
07:24 - need to have those projects okay those
07:25 - are
07:25 - probably one of the most most important
07:27 - things you need to have right why
07:29 - projects specifically
07:32 - because why oh you're asking you're
07:33 - asking i'm asking why projects i'm
07:34 - testing you bro that's
07:36 - oh man this this quiz is hard guys it's
07:38 - hard
07:39 - projects is probably where you can
07:41 - actually highlight specific
07:43 - skill sets that you've been able to
07:45 - develop because you build something
07:47 - for a job right so if you're applying
07:49 - for web front-end developer
07:51 - using react you could show them a
07:53 - portfolio of specific react
07:55 - projects you've built and that shows
07:57 - them like you don't even have to tell
07:58 - them but that literally shows them
08:00 - the skill set that you have now if you
08:02 - know how to translate that and tell them
08:03 - through the resume
08:04 - that's even more bonus points exactly
08:06 - exactly because the thing is
08:07 - you know what you need to understand is
08:09 - the fact that what you need to
08:10 - understand is it's pretty
08:12 - simple like you know you can say that
08:13 - you worked at this company or you can
08:14 - say that you work at this company but at
08:16 - the end of the day
08:17 - what you understand is your projects is
08:20 - what back up
08:21 - your skills it's as simple as that your
08:24 - projects
08:25 - back up your skills period okay
08:28 - period and so you have to get those
08:30 - straight guys
08:31 - if you don't have projects build
08:33 - projects if you do have projects
08:34 - put them on github so really important
08:37 - right i want to say you know
08:38 - is you know put them you know have make
08:41 - sure you have them on github as well
08:42 - make sure if you have a project that's
08:44 - live live project as well so basically
08:46 - the actual link to the live project that
08:48 - would be amazing as well okay
08:50 - so put them on github put it as a live
08:52 - project and that's it that's all you
08:54 - need
08:55 - okay so awesome so what we've done
08:58 - through the projects and we'll
08:59 - tell you how to specifically you know
09:01 - how to format them we'll talk about that
09:02 - here in a second but
09:03 - let's go continue on so work experience
09:05 - let's go next one work experience
09:08 - work experience so guys if you've done
09:10 - work experience
09:11 - in the software realm then you
09:13 - definitely want to highlight it
09:15 - now if you really haven't you might
09:17 - still be able to pick up
09:18 - potentially other skills that you've
09:20 - been able to get from those jobs that
09:22 - might apply for example
09:24 - i don't know maybe if you were a manager
09:25 - at mcdonald's you can maybe highlight
09:28 - that as a manager you were able to work
09:29 - with people lead a team
09:31 - but it's going to be very limited
09:32 - because what you do want to have the
09:34 - majority of the section be
09:35 - the actual technical stuff that you've
09:37 - worked on so if it is applicable make
09:39 - sure you
09:40 - make sure to add it and find that angle
09:42 - that which you can make it work for you
09:43 - exactly beautiful of course an education
09:46 - if you have education if you do not have
09:47 - education that's completely okay i just
09:49 - want to let you know guys
09:50 - that is completely okay you know but if
09:52 - you do have it you know put it on there
09:53 - and you you should be great
09:54 - um and then oh dang someone just donate
09:57 - again
09:58 - i can't put the links on the chat but if
10:00 - you search up my name on react.js resume
10:02 - dang someone you're just killing it
10:06 - of course those ten dollars are going to
10:08 - return oh yeah a lot more for you
10:10 - brother because you're providing value
10:12 - if you provide value
10:13 - the money just comes it's crazy even as
10:15 - a developer you can provide value
10:17 - to a business the money just comes with
10:19 - the big salary with the big paycheck
10:21 - exactly so thank you so much salman all
10:23 - right let's go ahead and continue on
10:25 - and of course if you have a reference a
10:26 - reference what is a reference a
10:27 - reference is someone seriously that
10:29 - pretty much
10:30 - references a person that can you know
10:32 - that can
10:33 - go ahead and support you so for example
10:34 - they will call that reference for
10:36 - example maybe it's someone you worked
10:37 - with before
10:38 - or someone you know they will actually
10:39 - call their reference and ask hey
10:41 - you know how is it to work with this
10:43 - person so make sure it's someone that
10:45 - you trust and
10:46 - they can say actually a good thing
10:47 - instead of saying do not put down
10:48 - someone who hates you
10:52 - i think that's a really important part
10:54 - yeah and i guess another tip is
10:57 - if you don't have someone on top of mind
10:58 - or you kind of want to see
11:00 - how they're feeling about it you could
11:01 - also just say you know willing to
11:03 - provide reference or something like that
11:04 - right if you don't have someone's
11:06 - contact information
11:07 - right off the bat that's another option
11:08 - you can do exactly exactly
11:10 - cool so go ahead and continue on so next
11:12 - things how to build
11:13 - how to mistake how to build mistakes
11:17 - so mistakes we know which one nas is
11:19 - really passionate about it's pretty
11:20 - obvious i know it's
11:23 - i know it's pretty simple the one i'm
11:25 - just really passionate about because i'm
11:26 - just it gets me so pissed guys
11:28 - it's like please do not make it more
11:30 - than one page and make it you know only
11:31 - one page do not make it three four pages
11:33 - two pages
11:34 - no recruiter has the time to go through
11:37 - that okay so just that's the one main
11:38 - thing to understand
11:40 - no recruiter has the time to go through
11:42 - that okay
11:43 - exactly and the second thing you want to
11:45 - avoid all right is there
11:47 - there's a fine line between being so
11:49 - fancy that it's so distracting and
11:51 - you're not highlighting the important
11:53 - stuff
11:53 - and also being so simplistic that you're
11:56 - not highlighting anything that
11:57 - everything just looks blah like
11:58 - no throw up on paper so you just want to
12:01 - find that line that's just very simple
12:03 - and it highlights the things that you
12:04 - wanted to hide
12:05 - so let's get jump straight into we've
12:07 - got we've talked a little bit about
12:09 - the resumes what you should and
12:11 - shouldn't do are you ready
12:13 - for those resume reviews
12:17 - let's go let's go bro let's go so
12:20 - really simple here really simple here
12:22 - we're going to go through your resumes
12:24 - there
12:24 - are right here someone says
12:28 - some of uh obviously just became your
12:30 - 500 subscriber nice
12:32 - nice nice nice somebody john john asks
12:35 - can you use your instructor for
12:36 - reference yes you can
12:37 - yes you can make ask him ask him if like
12:40 - ask him hey can i use
12:42 - you for reference and just let him know
12:44 - that's it okay
12:46 - that's it uh all right cool so let's go
12:49 - ahead and continue on
12:50 - so i have a lot of resumes as you can
12:52 - see here right that people have
12:53 - submitted
12:54 - and there's a lot of for us to go
12:57 - through and the question is like
12:59 - what do you want to go through so what
13:00 - do you think huh
13:02 - um but i was responding over here you're
13:04 - asking what do we want to do
13:06 - let's uh i guess we didn't pre-screen
13:09 - them so it's it's kind of like a lottery
13:10 - lottery thing i guess i kind of kind of
13:12 - want to go through
13:13 - this one all right let's do it
13:18 - i'm gonna minimize your screen so i can
13:19 - maximize this yeah let's go through this
13:21 - one
13:23 - yes oh and guys
13:26 - don't take any offense to this yes this
13:28 - is us just
13:29 - letting you know our thoughts what we
13:32 - would do
13:33 - if we laugh don't take any offense right
13:35 - we're just trying to have a good time
13:36 - here right
13:37 - because we're gonna laugh because we're
13:39 - gonna laugh and that's fine we laughed
13:41 - at our own
13:42 - like if i pulled up my very first resume
13:45 - i would have pointed at myself
13:46 - and laughed so hard and the dude
13:48 - probably would have peed his pants from
13:50 - all the laughing that was being done to
13:51 - him
13:51 - right so don't take any offense and he
13:53 - literally literally stands
13:55 - we love you guys so take this with you
13:57 - know
13:58 - uh uh an open an open mind exactly
14:01 - exactly
14:02 - i would say so so okay let's look at
14:04 - this so it looks like d show right here
14:10 - so let's take a look at your resume okay
14:11 - really quickly here right off the bat
14:13 - oh right here so i didn't show them the
14:16 - the screen just yet so there we go now
14:18 - you guys see it so right off the bat
14:20 - what do we what are we seeing here what
14:21 - do you think okay
14:23 - um so first thing for me i at least from
14:26 - the experience i've had
14:28 - pictures don't really work right because
14:30 - what that allows them to do is
14:32 - that allows them to already i guess
14:35 - i don't know was it prejudge you before
14:37 - they even start looking at anything
14:39 - just because of how you look so even if
14:41 - you look professional there's already
14:42 - some i guess uh
14:45 - what are those called uh so because of
14:47 - the whole black lives matter there's a
14:49 - lot of researchers that start looking
14:50 - into like
14:51 - i guess pre uh things that you already
14:53 - judge of just because of like for
14:54 - example
14:55 - their their skin color or their
14:58 - background or ethnicity or whatever that
14:59 - may be
15:00 - so me personally i've never seen
15:01 - pictures i don't know what's your take
15:02 - on that no
15:03 - i haven't heard your take on that before
15:05 - yeah i would say i'll say as well
15:06 - pictures are not necessary that's not
15:07 - why you
15:08 - you know you put this on your resume so
15:09 - say remove your pictures honestly
15:12 - you know that's that's the main thing
15:13 - right so um
15:15 - they know how you look like they don't
15:16 - you things like that you shouldn't put
15:18 - on your resume that that's just as
15:20 - simple as that
15:21 - okay um second thing that pops out to me
15:25 - we talked about not being too fancy yeah
15:27 - i feel like
15:28 - maybe this show is trying to be a little
15:29 - fancy with that background and it's too
15:31 - distracting it's hard to
15:33 - read yeah the actual letters because
15:35 - it's just like these so remove the
15:38 - background

15:43 - guys make sure make sure to remove the
15:44 - background guys

15:52 - shown to everybody so honestly the
15:54 - contact is
15:55 - is fine if people submit it to our
15:58 - resume that means they are
15:59 - completely okay with showing the contact
16:01 - okay so don't
16:02 - go ahead and hate on us for showing the
16:05 - contact
16:05 - we let people know remove your contact

16:09 - okay beautiful so so when i when we when
16:11 - we say
16:12 - fanciness this fancy colors right here
16:15 - are necessary not necessary at all these
16:16 - fancy colors
16:18 - i don't need no fancy colors at all so
16:20 - remove that just make it plain white
16:22 - okay plain white and that is it
16:25 - okay uh no someone i would say you know
16:28 - remove uh no some of that is not right
16:32 - still remove your picture someone i
16:35 - don't agree with
16:36 - you still remove the picture okay
16:38 - stimulate the picture
16:39 - so let's go ahead and continue on so
16:41 - remove that part i don't need don't you
16:42 - specifically need
16:43 - the background at all the name here
16:45 - pretty that's fine
16:47 - then i have no no problem with this
16:49 - that's fine education
16:50 - um let me see what about education what
16:53 - do you think
16:55 - uh let's see education i feel like
16:59 - so there's two things because on the
17:00 - left i see that she's saying
17:02 - i'm a student which is part of the
17:04 - education on the right i feel like it's
17:06 - just taking a lot of space as well
17:08 - yeah so yeah so i feel like that could
17:10 - definitely be simplified
17:11 - yeah so i think a little bit of
17:12 - simplification interest education here
17:14 - you don't need to
17:15 - talk about your classes 11 through 12. i
17:17 - would say just talk about
17:19 - where you your latest education that's
17:22 - it
17:23 - that's it exactly okay just relay the
17:25 - latest education talk about your latest
17:28 - right your latest
17:32 - latest hold on
17:35 - latest education okay may that be
17:38 - college whatever
17:39 - it be if you actually if you have here's
17:41 - the cool part
17:42 - if you have experience like prior
17:46 - experience
17:48 - you don't you if you don't have
17:50 - experience you don't actually need
17:53 - need education period that's it
17:57 - okay you don't actually need education
17:59 - that is a new experience
18:00 - it looks like disha is still you know
18:02 - she's still she's still in 12th grade
18:03 - and so forth she still learned a lot
18:05 - um skills fast learners so this seems
18:07 - like
18:08 - by someone who's still like in high
18:09 - school that which is completely fine
18:11 - you know but it's still good something
18:14 - good to learn so
18:15 - skills fast learner uh st
18:18 - things like that honestly what about
18:20 - what do you think about this
18:21 - we don't need this stuff right here i'm
18:22 - a certified ethical hacker i'm
18:24 - sports you know we don't need that you
18:26 - know what skills you have
18:27 - talk specifically go ahead daniel yeah i
18:30 - think i was about to say exactly what
18:31 - you're about to say
18:32 - which is talk about a project you've
18:34 - built if you haven't built a project go
18:36 - build some projects
18:37 - right start to gain that experience but
18:39 - when you talk about those projects
18:41 - it's what have you said before the proof
18:43 - is in the pudding it's like the proof
18:45 - is in the pudding
18:48 - exactly so go talk about projects if you
18:51 - don't
18:52 - have projects talk about go build
18:53 - projects and we have a shitload
18:56 - of tutorials on that especially when it
18:58 - comes to react javascript learn
19:00 - whatever that is so you could go through
19:01 - the channel start to build those things
19:03 - and you would start to develop some
19:04 - insane technical skills
19:06 - that you probably wouldn't even develop
19:08 - at a regular boot camp exactly sweet so
19:10 - let's continue on
19:11 - really and that's honestly that's pretty
19:12 - much it you don't need to change i mean
19:14 - honestly that's just just change that
19:16 - part
19:16 - and add add some skills add projects
19:18 - that is all you need for
19:20 - for this right so let me see add add
19:23 - projects right that is the most
19:24 - important thing and that's it guys okay
19:26 - so i think we're kind of we're done with
19:27 - this resume what do you think
19:29 - i think yeah i think we're doing this
19:31 - resume okay cool
19:32 - so disha you are all good let's go and
19:34 - continue on
19:35 - next up who do you think could be next
19:37 - next next next next next next
19:40 - we see we have zhanesh
19:44 - uh hold on we had a special request from
19:47 - someone in the audience
19:48 - what's his name uh to review theirs look
19:51 - up mauro
19:53 - m-a-u-r-o is it
19:58 - mauro m-a-u-r-o
20:02 - m-a-u or the m-a-u
20:10 - okay i like it okay okay let's take a
20:12 - look at this okay i like this this is
20:14 - cool
20:15 - so all right i'm seeing some zoom in
20:18 - i zoom into this one all right so i love
20:21 - honestly
20:22 - okay so let's see let's look at this
20:24 - look looks looks familiar
20:26 - looks pretty familiar to what maybe
20:28 - someone here has
20:32 - interesting
20:37 - so i got your name i like that okay i
20:39 - got the fact that
20:40 - you know it's really easy to read so
20:41 - number one i would say
20:43 - pretty pretty easy to read and which is
20:45 - why like right you got your technical
20:47 - skills
20:47 - your projects you know basically it's
20:50 - easy to follow
20:51 - that's that's the thing right so it's
20:53 - easy easy to follow
20:55 - right that is the most important thing
20:57 - right if you look at a resume
20:59 - and your resume and you can specifically
21:01 - say
21:02 - you guys are saying boring yes but
21:05 - boring
21:05 - boring like resumes like this actually
21:08 - is what gets you the job
21:10 - yep well the interview i mean or the
21:12 - interview
21:13 - the interview right not the job the
21:16 - interview
21:16 - here's why because it doesn't matter how
21:19 - fancy the resume is
21:20 - what matter it matters is the words
21:24 - what matters is how fast can the
21:27 - recruiter
21:27 - right how fast can a recruiter read your
21:29 - resume how fast
21:31 - right can they read
21:34 - your resume right how many how many
21:37 - seconds do you think they have nods or
21:38 - how many seconds you think they spend
21:40 - just
21:40 - looking at your resume they literally
21:42 - have five seconds
21:44 - five seconds to look at your resume and
21:45 - decide if it's gonna go or not
21:47 - that's it only five seconds
21:52 - and if you're gonna add some crazy
21:53 - colors and and and fancy
21:55 - and be like
21:56 - and animations and they'll just show
21:58 - them you know just like you know
22:00 - and everything just kind of blends in
22:02 - you know then it's not going to work out
22:04 - so well
22:05 - so it's very important just keep it
22:06 - simple that is the most important part
22:07 - okay
22:08 - continue on that's nice let's go and
22:10 - continue with this one
22:12 - i think on this one we could dive into
22:13 - the details just to kind of talk about
22:15 - you know you always talk about making
22:17 - them action oriented i mean also if you
22:18 - look
22:19 - it looks like he's starting off with
22:20 - this project instead of his work
22:21 - experience again
22:22 - so i'm curious what his work experience
22:24 - looks like yeah yeah exactly
22:26 - so let's go ahead and say so we got
22:28 - projects
22:29 - which is really cool as well and then
22:32 - let me see projects and then his
22:33 - education
22:34 - it doesn't have oh like work experience
22:35 - is on the bottom as well
22:37 - and it's an offset texas that's i love
22:38 - it i love it i love it so
22:40 - hold on we're seeing okay it's because
22:42 - it was a little lagged on without seeing
22:43 - all right we're good we're good you see
22:45 - it now
22:46 - yeah actually no beautiful okay great so
22:48 - so projects okay cool so
22:50 - create it looks like let me see so you
22:52 - got a twitter showcase
22:54 - react.js twitter expenses expenses
22:56 - tracker app so you got the twitter
22:58 - showcase okay snake game app
23:02 - okay you got the expenses yeah the
23:04 - twitter showcase app i will say do
23:05 - listen to like a twitter clone app
23:07 - like uh trying to change this name
23:09 - instead of being is this
23:10 - is this what is this a twitter showcase
23:11 - is this a twitter app or what
23:13 - uh potentially i don't think that's a
23:16 - clone one because he's using different
23:17 - technology there
23:19 - no he's still using node i don't think
23:22 - that's our
23:22 - our twitter clone i think that's a
23:24 - difference okay if it's a twitter clone
23:25 - i would say twitter clone because i'm
23:26 - not i'm not sure what showcase is like
23:28 - like what is showcase you know what i
23:29 - mean
23:30 - so that's what you need to understand so
23:31 - what is show
23:34 - showcase gotcha so the project itself
23:36 - has an ambiguous name
23:38 - exactly next up let's let's look look
23:40 - into the actual things he said so create
23:42 - a static
23:43 - what ui that allows users to what
23:48 - to search for tweets by sending http
23:49 - requests to an external api insert my
23:51 - website using node express
23:53 - utilize npm scripts to set up a dev
23:55 - environment
23:56 - create an internal or um an internal oh
23:59 - you know
23:59 - correct that part right here yeah
24:02 - correct that part make sure
24:03 - um api to communicate and grab data from
24:05 - external api
24:07 - utilize the twitter api to retrieve and
24:08 - display tweets based on the user's
24:10 - content
24:11 - search a random type tweet from a
24:12 - selection if i use this one
24:14 - put this one on the top right there
24:18 - utilize twitter api to retrieve and
24:20 - display tweets based on the user content
24:23 - based on based on user search or random
24:25 - tweet
24:26 - from a section of five and that's it you
24:27 - don't need this as well
24:29 - right making that sense because that is
24:32 - that's basically
24:33 - that is probably the most important
24:34 - bullet you have you want to make sure
24:36 - that's the top one all the
24:37 - things are like small things that you
24:38 - had to do for that yeah
24:40 - so make this on the top one okay the
24:42 - purpose of this app was to help
24:43 - okay i understand the entire full-stack
24:45 - process and hone in on my technical
24:46 - skills
24:47 - i like this this is i mean this is
24:48 - pretty cool what do you think about that
24:50 - dude he
24:51 - followed the process yeah he literally
24:53 - has he he literally has his
24:55 - resume template and then he just you
24:57 - probably watched our videos and did what
24:58 - we say to do
24:59 - exactly exactly so this stuff i like you
25:02 - don't need to have
25:03 - all of this other stuff honestly this
25:05 - right here you don't need to have all
25:06 - this what do you think about this one
25:10 - i think that's a good point because a
25:11 - lot of those things are kind of like
25:13 - you know served my website using node
25:16 - and express
25:17 - yeah it's kind of like a given when you
25:18 - set up a website yeah right
25:20 - the the creating static files especially
25:23 - like the html and the css
25:25 - that's also kind of a given when you're
25:27 - creating websites so i think you're
25:28 - right i think those
25:29 - last bullets yeah the ones that actually
25:31 - grasp
25:33 - what actually happened of yeah exactly
25:35 - the challenge of this project what was
25:37 - learned
25:37 - yeah exactly so you do not need
25:39 - specifically to say that like
25:41 - create an aesthetic file you either
25:42 - allows you to search for tweets
25:44 - or you can say for example created an
25:45 - application well you you said here
25:48 - us with api to retrieve and display
25:50 - tweets based on user search that's it
25:51 - like
25:52 - that's pretty much it right i would say
25:53 - focus mainly on that
25:55 - for this for example for this app so for
25:58 - this app and again the reason why is
25:59 - because you want to focus on a few
26:00 - bullet points
26:01 - instead of trying to do everything all
26:03 - at once right that's the whole
26:05 - segment exactly
26:08 - all right next up so what do we got
26:10 - create a ui that allows users to track
26:12 - expenses and help improve spending
26:14 - habits i like that
26:17 - static file i'm not sure what that
26:18 - means static file
26:20 - uh so i think the advice is probably
26:22 - gonna be similar like take up the static
26:23 - file
26:24 - yeah um create a ui utilize
26:27 - yeah the fourth one which is like
26:28 - utilize npm scripts to set up dev
26:30 - environment
26:31 - yeah maybe i don't know how important
26:34 - that dev environment stuff is but i
26:36 - don't think
26:36 - no it's not yeah i would say not no
26:40 - yeah so similar similar advice to the
26:42 - other one it's like you could clean out
26:43 - some things to really focus on the main
26:46 - the beef of the project yeah i would say
26:48 - here credit ui that allows users to
26:50 - track expenses and help improve spending
26:52 - habits
26:52 - that is great create application that
26:54 - which with class-based components and
26:55 - that's also i think and this as well
26:57 - it's pretty pretty cool too right
26:58 - because you talk about you know what
26:59 - specifically you use i think
27:00 - you know um well honestly i'm not sure
27:03 - about this what do you think about this
27:04 - wait which one are we talking about this
27:06 - one
27:08 - create application with web-based
27:09 - components difference the objects
27:11 - utilize props
27:12 - um so i feel like those are already
27:15 - reactings
27:16 - right yeah they're kind of given yeah um
27:19 - i think that could probably be
27:20 - changed a little bit more because it
27:23 - looks like this might have been
27:24 - his first react project yeah so maybe
27:27 - he's trying to
27:28 - show that that's what he learned in this
27:30 - project so maybe
27:31 - i don't know if there's a way to be like
27:32 - oh okay like you know
27:35 - if this is the first project where i did
27:36 - react these were the things that i
27:38 - learned or if it's even worth doing that
27:39 - but i think that's what he's trying to
27:40 - do with this yeah
27:41 - i would say so too as well so i would
27:43 - say for this one for example you could
27:44 - say create an application
27:45 - create utilizing um up to date react
27:48 - here
27:48 - here's how i would say here's how i
27:50 - would say it right i would say
27:52 - created an application created the
27:55 - application
27:56 - application utilizing
28:00 - all uh all the up to date all the up to
28:03 - uh all up to date
28:07 - to up damn it up to
28:10 - date react.js features
28:14 - that's it like components
28:18 - right components um
28:21 - props and state
28:24 - so what do you think about that
28:30 - i like that because it includes like hey
28:32 - these are the things that i did in this
28:33 - specific case and i think
28:35 - it could bring up that conversation yeah
28:37 - in in
28:38 - in the interview that it's like hey this
28:40 - is where i first learned react
28:42 - and i was able to dive deep into
28:44 - learning components props
28:46 - states everything that has to do with
28:48 - react exactly so that's why i like that
28:50 - so i would say
28:51 - remove that and then exchange it with
28:53 - this and then remove these other ones
28:54 - like we use the npm for this
28:56 - you know utilizing react for this we
28:58 - don't necessarily need that okay
29:00 - and then so that's all good i like i
29:02 - like that part let's go ahead and talk
29:03 - about
29:05 - the snake game so let's see create a
29:08 - classic 2d version
29:09 - let's see 2d version okay let me see
29:13 - of the snake game built with javascript
29:15 - html you said okay
29:16 - utilize for loops um don't need this
29:20 - again
29:21 - or this as well the deploy to github
29:23 - pages you do not need to tell me do you
29:25 - deploy to github pages because i know
29:27 - that this is on github pages
29:29 - you know what i mean right so we
29:32 - don't necessarily need this right but
29:35 - for something for example like
29:37 - create a classic to-do version of the
29:39 - snake game billboard javascript
29:40 - i think that's fine what do you think i
29:43 - think that's good man
29:44 - i mean i think he was trying to showcase
29:46 - and highlight specific things that are
29:48 - already given
29:49 - as part of the project and those are
29:50 - things that he could talk about
29:52 - in the interview if it comes up but no
29:54 - one's gonna be like hey did you learn
29:56 - uh for loops you know what i mean yeah
29:58 - yeah it's exactly that's that's
30:00 - something a little more fundamental but
30:01 - i think
30:01 - still i think if we could start to
30:03 - remove these things that's great
30:04 - that gives them more room to add more
30:06 - projects exactly like an amazon
30:08 - clone or something yeah
30:12 - so awesome so let's go and take a look
30:14 - at now your specific uh
30:16 - actual job so service service direct
30:18 - okay i like how for example here
30:20 - the pros of this because i'm going to
30:22 - state the pros here you know
30:23 - it's clear uh clear dates right like
30:26 - clear dates and a very clear you know uh
30:30 - you know format so you know i know for
30:32 - example that you
30:33 - were working as a data analyst and i are
30:35 - still working as data analyst
30:37 - you know at service direct in austin
30:39 - texas you know since august 2018.
30:42 - so and and i think this is a great
30:44 - example of something you touched up
30:45 - a lot on nas but if you notice look how
30:48 - his
30:49 - his work and his background have nothing
30:52 - to do
30:53 - with computer science so he puts them on
30:56 - the bottom
30:57 - but he highlights the projects that he's
30:58 - built yes so he puts those on the top
31:00 - exactly because he was this is he wants
31:02 - to get a developer position is it i'm
31:04 - sure that that's
31:04 - that's the goal yeah we i mean we figure
31:07 - right yeah
31:08 - that's why he's here
31:11 - like he doesn't have a computer science
31:13 - degree and people here are saying i
31:14 - don't have computer science degree
31:16 - i look edwin said that in the chat look
31:18 - edwin i bet you anything
31:20 - this person can land a job because he's
31:22 - showcasing his experience
31:24 - he's putting in the work doesn't have a
31:26 - computer science degree and i guarantee
31:28 - he'd be able to land a job if he just
31:30 - keeps going at it exactly
31:32 - exactly cool so yeah so go ahead and put
31:34 - your projects up front this is why i
31:35 - talk so much about that specific aspect
31:37 - right put your project
31:38 - up front guys cool let's talk about a
31:42 - little bit now
31:43 - okay the text here so data analyst
31:45 - transform data into readable goal-driven
31:47 - reports for continued
31:48 - innovation and growth uh through google
31:50 - day studio okay
31:53 - okay i don't know what the that is
31:54 - but all right all right
31:57 - in order to draw conclusions for
31:58 - managerial actions and strategy
32:00 - okay all right so so for example here
32:03 - how
32:04 - i would do it is for example here here's
32:06 - how i would say here
32:07 - so we want to talk about results plus
32:10 - action right so we want to talk about
32:12 - results
32:13 - right results plus action right and i'm
32:16 - sure you already know this
32:17 - at this point but here's how i would
32:19 - state yours i would say for example
32:21 - uh helped with uh helped improve
32:24 - managerial managerial actions and
32:26 - strategies so
32:27 - improved remember that keyword right
32:30 - improved
32:31 - right improved and created
32:34 - increased decrease that is what you want
32:37 - to look at
32:38 - so we want to say improved managerial
32:43 - actions and strategy
32:47 - by by interpreting
32:51 - printing interpreting google data studio
32:54 - data there we go
32:59 - google data studio what i like it i just
33:03 - like the double
33:06 - right there google data studio
33:11 - that's it that's it right there right
33:14 - perfect right and then you can say for
33:16 - example created goal-driven reports
33:19 - for continuous innovation through google
33:21 - critic
33:22 - created for example you can say created
33:25 - created goal driven reports
33:34 - event reports general reports
33:38 - for continuous innovation boom
33:43 - innovation done that's it okay
33:47 - uh then you say uh for then you talk
33:49 - about developed and implied data
33:51 - analysis
33:52 - data cluster systems and also to them to
33:54 - to optimize
33:55 - statistical efficiency and quality so
33:57 - here i would say i would say
33:58 - optimize statistical efficiency and
34:01 - quality
34:02 - by develop by implementing data analysis
34:05 - and data collection
34:06 - so here i would say exactly so go ahead
34:10 - basically to summarize what's going on
34:11 - here is there's two things you always
34:13 - want to have in each sentence
34:15 - what was the action yes what was the
34:17 - result it makes it even better it's a
34:19 - bonus if you could start with the
34:21 - results
34:22 - and then talk about the action so right
34:23 - here moto what you have
34:25 - is you have the action that you took and
34:27 - the result that you got
34:28 - but if you just start with that results
34:30 - like any marketing thing if you start
34:32 - the result
34:33 - it's just a little bit better exactly
34:35 - that's what i would say i would i would
34:36 - say as well so
34:37 - so here for example what i would say is
34:40 - is where would i say this hold on i
34:43 - would say
34:44 - optimize statistical efficiency and
34:45 - quality optimized
34:51 - efficiency you guys might not see that
34:54 - at this point efficiency
34:55 - and quality right yeah right through
34:59 - the develop by implementing data
35:01 - analysis
35:02 - and data collection systems that's it
35:05 - exactly
35:06 - so the result was optimized efficiency
35:08 - and quality
35:09 - what was the action i developed he
35:12 - developed
35:13 - and implemented the anatomy
35:17 - and so guys if you now look at right if
35:18 - you look at you know when a recruiter
35:20 - now looks at your stuff you can see
35:22 - they see created they see improved
35:25 - and they see optimize and right away

39:14 - there's some sections that i wouldn't
39:15 - agree with like a little bit about me
39:17 - it's very well sectioned easy to read
39:20 - or your eyes can follow through very
39:22 - easily okay yeah
39:24 - pros okay so it's sectioned right so

39:50 - is pretty cool
39:52 - skill section is good yeah it's very
39:54 - simple like the other one talks about
39:55 - languages frameworks
39:56 - databases tools very simple ah what
39:59 - i just do
40:00 -  all right now it's this one's
40:04 - interesting
40:05 - but so you hate when people rate their
40:07 - skills

40:25 - does this mean that you know you know
40:26 - spanish fifty percent of the language
40:29 - what does this mean
40:32 - that means that if i spoke to you fifty
40:34 - percent of the time you wouldn't
40:35 - understand me i agree i don't like the
40:39 - bars
40:39 - i do however think when it comes to
40:41 - languages there's at least like some
40:43 - sort of
40:45 - comprehension dude you could say like
40:46 - all right dude i know
40:48 - basics you'll figure it out on the job

40:55 - quad
40:56 - language how do you say that
41:01 - that's dope though four languages i love
41:02 - it that is absolutely amazing that is
41:05 - dope that is dope so
41:06 - i think i think that is awesome so
41:08 - languages again just remove that part

41:28 - google
41:29 - or something like that they will
41:30 - actually flag you down for putting a
41:32 - picture

42:13 - okay cool next up what do we have
42:16 - let me see i'm gonna put myself here so
42:20 - i can see
42:21 - god there's just so many
42:24 - yeah okay next up let's talk a little
42:27 - bit about so your skills are great i
42:28 - love your skills that's awesome
42:30 - but what i think okay so skills are
42:32 - awesome let's talk about your
42:35 - let me see what else do we have so we we
42:37 - actually got a quick question about this
42:39 - nozzle i want to get your input
42:40 - um ask aksha asked how do you feel about
42:44 - the resume design do you feel it's more
42:45 - on the fancy side or it's just like it
42:47 - it has a good
42:48 - balance of not too fancy not too
42:51 - personally
42:52 - i actually think it's not bad what do
42:55 - you think
42:56 - yeah i was looking at that too i feel
42:57 - like like at first i was like oh the
42:59 - icons that's interesting to like dictate
43:01 - different things but it's also not too
43:03 - like though the first one that just had
43:05 - a lot of blue and the squares yeah
43:07 - yeah it's very distracting but this
43:09 - really isn't that distracting at all
43:11 - not distracted it's honestly still clean
43:13 - like i can still because for example i
43:15 - can still
43:15 - read i can still read intern and time
43:18 - stop i can still read
43:19 - intern and rapid post right and so forth
43:22 - one thing i would add to here is uh for
43:24 - example
43:25 - what type of an intern are you okay so
43:27 - really important here right
43:28 - remember keywords for example i would
43:29 - say for example i would say
43:31 - the starter developer intern
43:36 - intern right there that's i would say
43:39 - right
43:40 - whatever developer software engineer
43:42 - intern
43:43 - put that on there would you agree with
43:44 - me on that one
43:46 - yeah i mean how do we know you just
43:47 - weren't a janitor yeah exactly time soft
43:50 - right
43:51 - it could have been a part-time janitor
43:54 - for all that yeah so i would say remove
43:55 - that portion
43:56 - exactly no add that portion on there
43:58 - okay but i do love it the cleanness it's
44:00 - honestly honestly it is not overkill
44:03 - you know honestly it's not overkill one
44:05 - thing i would remove is
44:07 - i'll remove interest as well
44:09 - unfortunately
44:11 - because again it's not something a
44:13 - recruiter is not going to look at your
44:14 - interest recorder is going to look at
44:16 - what you know
44:16 - they're going to look at your skills
44:18 - right so once they remove interest
44:22 - because why right don't take that person
44:25 - go ahead
44:26 - well what's up go ahead you talk i was
44:28 - just gonna say hello hello don't take
44:29 - that personally because i
44:30 - also have interest in my resume if you
44:32 - look at it so nas also called me out on
44:34 - it so don't take it personally yeah
44:35 - exactly
44:36 - so they don't care about what your
44:37 - interests are they really care about
44:38 - what skills do you have
44:40 - they care about you know care about
44:42 - about
44:43 - projects the skills right skills
44:46 - you know projects
44:51 - and all that stuff right so that's why
44:53 - that's what i'll say to you
44:54 - you know what i mean so that's what i'll
44:56 - say and uh
44:57 - honestly and then let me see so let's
44:59 - see let's continue on what what does she
45:01 - also
45:01 - have let's continue on so we got intern
45:05 - so if we look at i'm going to zoom in on
45:07 - here for a second
45:08 - just so i can so you guys can read it as
45:10 - well
45:12 - come on zoom it zoom it
45:16 - oh fudge all right this is all we got so
45:19 - it says utilize asp.net core api and
45:22 - angular a to develop and the different
45:23 - critical modules
45:25 - of sba booking tool okay including blah
45:27 - blah okay so
45:29 - it's a little bit oh shoot that's that's
45:31 - very zoomed in
45:34 - it's just a little bit delayed
45:37 - guys my computer oh my god i know my
45:39 - computer is trying hard okay i don't
45:41 - know what's going on here
45:44 - it is struggling my friend yeah somebody
45:46 - said do you don't you think gotchu
45:48 - don't you think the font is too small
45:51 - okay the font what do you think about
45:52 - the font
45:55 - i i really don't know what size it is i
45:57 - mean i i feel you'd want to shoot
45:59 - for like the typical 12 11 maybe
46:03 - but if you start to go any smaller than
46:05 - that i feel like that might just start
46:06 - to be
46:07 - smaller than what you want yeah so i
46:09 - think for here it's fine honestly i
46:11 - think your font is completely fine
46:13 - what i would say to you is so let's i
46:16 - want to change this up i don't like what
46:18 - this is right here i don't like this
46:20 - right here utilize asp.net
46:22 - web api here's what i would say instead
46:25 - what would you
46:26 - say here instead what do you think
46:30 - for intern time software yeah
46:33 - okay so again first thing you want to
46:35 - focus on is the result
46:37 - so as an intern the result you got was
46:40 - authenticating registration using
46:42 - identity core
46:43 - and uh reservation models i'm not sure
46:45 - what that is yeah but i would say what
46:46 - is the result of this
46:47 - sba booking tool right think about this
46:49 - right so you can either say that or you
46:51 - can say for example i co-developed an
46:53 - sp booking tool using asp.net web api
46:57 - and angular 8.
46:59 - if there is no result but if there is a
47:01 - result for example maybe you know
47:03 - a you know increased company efficiency
47:05 - by develop co-developing sp book or
47:07 - security
47:08 - or whatever that was exactly whatever
47:11 - your project the results it actually
47:12 - delivered to the
47:13 - security did it increase peace of mind
47:16 - did it
47:17 - do something to help other people yeah
47:19 - that's the result you want to lead with
47:21 - and like how nasa says if you really
47:22 - can't think of that result that's
47:24 - attached to your project you could just
47:26 - talk about
47:26 - the project itself which is developed
47:29 - co-develop spa booking tool
47:31 - exactly and then however not steady yeah
47:33 - yeah yeah yeah yeah
47:34 - so that's what i would say is for
47:35 - example i would say here and hella
47:38 - answer the question down below like what
47:39 - is the result of this right what did you
47:40 - do with time stop what was the result
47:42 - so i would say for example co developed
47:44 - developed
47:45 - co-developed
47:49 - sp booking tool
47:52 - booking tool using asp.net
47:57 - asp.net dot
48:00 - net and angular 8
48:03 - right angular 8. so that's what i would
48:06 - say right but if there's a result for
48:08 - example maybe
48:08 - increase efficiency or you know of some
48:11 - sort
48:12 - that's what i would say i'll use that in
48:14 - in that case
48:15 - right okay let's go and then
48:19 - if you have any links whatsoever to that
48:21 - tool drop it down below as well
48:23 - that's what i would say
48:26 - it's it's to manage a asp called lela
48:29 - baya
48:30 - okay so for example here you can sue
48:32 - help
48:33 - help management so increased management
48:36 - efficiency
48:37 - right so for example you can say
48:39 - increased i'm not sure increased
48:41 - management efficiency
48:44 - efficiency
48:47 - by by uh what's it called by
48:51 - co-developing a
48:54 - aspa booking tool right there boom
48:58 - right there what do you think about that
49:02 - increase management efficiency yep and
49:04 - then what you
49:06 - that was the result right so then again
49:08 - what did you do
49:09 - i developed co-developed spa booking
49:12 - tool
49:12 - and then your next bullet could be the
49:14 - languages used
49:16 - exactly so i think i think that's
49:17 - honestly that is great
49:19 - you know so and then you can say for
49:21 - example underneath you can say
49:22 - hey technology is used
49:26 - let jesus exactly boom right there and
49:28 - you can say angular
49:30 - comma asp.net.net and so forth
49:34 - and boom right there that is all you
49:35 - need that is all you need and do the
49:37 - exact same thing for these other ones as
49:39 - well right so do the exact same things
49:40 - for these other ones
49:41 - let me go ahead and remove that so
49:43 - hopefully you saved that but hopefully
49:44 - you can always rewatch it next time but
49:47 - so
49:48 - do that and then right so do the same
49:50 - thing for this one now what i do like
49:52 - from here i'm not sure if you guys know
49:53 - this
49:54 - but her dates are really good too these
49:57 - are really clear dates right and she
49:59 - keeps consistent dates you see this
50:00 - right here
50:01 - very consistent dates so i love that
50:03 - part what
50:05 - yeah i guess i want to just take it back
50:07 - real quick to the font size because it
50:08 - could be very different
50:10 - on paper than on the computer screen
50:12 - yeah so i would just go back to just
50:14 - actually see what font size it is and in
50:16 - my opinion i wouldn't try to go
50:18 - under 11. just because like i said it
50:21 - might be different on paper because i
50:23 - did notice it was a little bit smaller
50:25 - yeah from the beginning yeah so maybe
50:26 - maybe increase your fonts adjustments
50:29 - yeah like if it's already 11 12 then
50:31 - it's just the computer's looking
50:33 - kind of weird like it'll look good on
50:34 - paper yeah you know what i mean yeah
50:36 - yeah yeah
50:36 - also i would say here you see how it
50:38 - says intern and then real estate market
50:40 - keep these
50:41 - same font right keep these the same font
50:43 - right here
50:45 - oh yeah yeah this is cool keep it
50:48 - consistent
50:48 - what about education where
50:51 - right under does that also have the
50:53 - scene i'm trying to scroll down it's not
50:55 - it's not letting me
50:57 - yeah education
51:01 - yeah this has natural font this has but
51:03 - key
51:04 - keep the headings keep them similar
51:07 - right so keep heading similar and
51:10 - yeah and all the way down to
51:11 - achievements just like exactly keep it
51:13 - the same
51:14 - then it just goes along with the flow of
51:17 - the resume
51:17 - exactly exactly so let me see oh
51:20 - why is this resume it's so hard to read
51:22 - so hard to go through in here okay so
51:24 - let's take a look at now your projects
51:26 - okay your projects and i'm going to go
51:27 - through
51:28 - one project right here really quickly
51:30 - but overall so far a great resume i just
51:32 - want to let you know
51:33 - great resume yeah
51:37 - sylvia asks um
51:40 - sylvia asks so basically resume you need
51:42 - to make it as clear as three or four as
51:44 - much as possible
51:44 - yes yes yes yes exactly
51:48 - look at the next question guys
51:52 - should i go for severe resume
51:55 - the next question yeah i don't know
51:58 - should i go for a cv resume
52:01 - so guys we've talked a lot about this
52:04 - okay just to recap what's the difference
52:06 - for those who don't know the differences
52:09 - okay a resume is a one-page summary of
52:12 - the what you've done literally related
52:14 - to the work a cv
52:16 - is literally everything you've done so
52:18 - with cv can be the things that are like
52:20 - four or five pages right
52:22 - in the united states literally no one
52:24 - asked for a cv
52:26 - so just submit arrest me outside of the
52:29 - united states
52:30 - pay attention to what they're asking for
52:32 - if they specifically want a cv
52:35 - then send in your fortify page cv but
52:38 - mostly they're gonna say cv or resume
52:41 - then just send in the resume because
52:43 - then you don't have to worry about
52:44 - maintaining
52:45 - a five-page thing yeah
52:49 - so not a cds again what
52:52 - uh it's like latin like curriculum
52:55 - vitamin or something like that
52:56 - which stands for like all the things
52:58 - that you've done in your whole history
53:00 - oh yeah like your entire life you people
53:03 - like like if you worked at mcdonald's
53:04 - you put that there really what i
53:05 - mean
53:06 - yeah i've never had to upload a cv
53:08 - honestly guys
53:09 - only yeah only only upload your resume
53:12 - that's what i would say only upload your
53:13 - resume yeah
53:14 - and actually i just put what it is it's
53:16 - a curriculum

54:30 - your projects your projects
54:37 - really quickly okay so
54:40 - real estate marketing platform okay
54:44 - real estate market design and
54:45 - development of a web application or real
54:47 - estate platform
54:48 - using spring boot framework okay so so
54:51 - design okay so again use talk here
54:53 - you're talking about design development
54:55 - talk about what you did talk about what
54:58 - you did
55:00 - right what did you do on and
55:03 - in this academic project right so did
55:05 - you for example co-developed
55:07 - so for example you could say
55:08 - co-developed dakota developed
55:10 - a a a real estate platform using
55:14 - a co-developed a real estate platform a
55:17 - web application called
55:18 - a real estate state
55:22 - real estate real right now right real
55:24 - estate
55:27 - pla damn it platform
55:33 - uh web application
55:36 - using spring
55:39 - you can say using springboot as well
55:41 - that's fine all right so you can talk
55:43 - about
55:44 - what did you co develop right and if
55:45 - there was a really cool
55:47 - for example let's say you managed a team
55:49 - right so you can say for example
55:51 - is you know um kept the project on
55:54 - tracked
55:55 - on the project the project on track
56:00 - on track by managing
56:03 - no or by by managing the team or by for
56:06 - example
56:07 - by um by um i would say managing the
56:10 - team is that right daniel what do you
56:11 - think
56:13 - my bad i'm killing the youtube comments
56:15 - right now yeah i know um
56:18 - [Laughter]
56:20 - i'm just telling everyone to build more
56:22 - projects go check out the amazon club go
56:23 - check out the netflix clone go check out
56:25 - all the clones guys
56:26 - all the clothes we got you're gonna
56:28 - crush it all the clothes by the way i
56:30 - have a resume
56:31 - with 12 clones god damn that's gonna be
56:34 - insane what would you say
56:35 - by the way guys smash that thumbs up
56:37 - thumbs up button for us
56:38 - for the youtube algorithm we really
56:40 - would appreciate that let's go ahead and
56:41 - take this video to another level so
56:43 - smash that thumb up thumbs up button
56:45 - subscribe for more videos like this
56:47 - and we'll be all good all right let's
56:49 - continue on so gotcha so you
56:51 - you were asking me about this when the
56:52 - code development yeah for example okay
56:54 - so we said you know kept the project on
56:56 - track by by
56:58 - by managing the team you know can you
57:01 - say that
57:03 - i think we could maybe change the
57:05 - wording of the kept the project on track
57:08 - to maintain the projects
57:11 - trajectory or maintained the project's
57:14 - current
57:15 - pace or something like that obtained the
57:17 - product
57:18 - project trajectory
57:21 - right there maintained the project
57:24 - trajectory i think that's good
57:26 - okay perfect yeah and then what was the
57:28 - what was the action
57:30 - by by managing uh by
57:33 - correctly by correctly
57:37 - managing a team oh
57:40 - damn she managed the whole team no no no
57:42 - no no i'm saying if you did
57:43 - if you did i'm sorry oh yeah i was like
57:47 - let's go because sometimes you know
57:49 - sometimes you're the you're the team
57:50 - like
57:51 - you're the team leader right sometimes
57:52 - you're the team leader so if you were
57:53 - the team leader
57:54 - that is a great thing to put on here
57:56 - right you maintain the project
57:58 - trajectory by correctly managing the
57:59 - team right so
58:00 - that is an amazing wording to put on
58:02 - there it says that you
58:03 - it says that you manage the team it says
58:06 - that you lead
58:07 - you know how to lead people right and
58:09 - that's what people like
58:11 - that is what companies love
58:14 - a leader a leader a warrior leader a
58:16 - killer programmer yes
58:18 - a killer let's go
58:26 - okay i got a musical i got the music
58:28 - that's why i'm doing this but you don't
58:29 - got that
58:30 - you can't you can't dance bro no one
58:31 - else is hearing the music so that's
58:32 - unfair
58:33 - no they do you just don't
58:36 - oh damn for i feel lonely now hey
58:40 - hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
58:45 - i'm gonna get back to my youtube
58:47 - comments because i'm crushing it here
58:50 - so oh look i know it's funny it looks
58:53 - like hella did my look
58:55 - this is why i showed this because it's
58:56 - so funny hellas like i actually did did
58:59 - they were all lazy asses see this is why
59:02 - i put this down because i had a
59:04 - hunch that that's probably what happened
59:06 - so
59:07 - make sure to put that down hella okay
59:10 - that they're lazy no not that far
59:18 - my god not that the part that where you
59:21 - manage the team okay
59:24 - lazy asses okay so i love that okay so
59:27 - next up the integrated development
59:29 - project
59:29 - led the development into integration of
59:31 - java development integration journal a
59:33 - desktop app with a mobile app
59:35 - web-based application uh using uh so i
59:38 - would say
59:38 - again spread this up into one word um
59:41 - into one sentence okay
59:42 - so you can put this into two three
59:44 - sentences but the most important thing
59:46 - what i would say for this one is
59:48 - again talk about the result what did you
59:49 - do did you you know
59:52 - let the development of a
59:56 - if a mobile app you of desktop
60:00 - what is the mobile app called
60:03 - or what was the purpose of the mobile if
60:05 - you have a name for it sometimes it's
60:06 - pretty cool just so it's like oh man
60:08 - like you know it's like
60:09 - it's a tangible thing not just some app
60:12 - let the development
60:14 - i like the wording led
60:18 - of a mobile app
60:22 - to improve i don't know a user
60:26 - search i don't know whatever i'm not
60:27 - sure what you did but but you get my
60:29 - point though
60:30 - you get my point right so let
60:32 - development of a mobile app to improve
60:33 - user
60:34 - user user search okay so i like that and
60:36 - then at the bottom you can talk about
60:37 - the
60:38 - technologies you used and so forth
60:42 - boom right there so talk about that next
60:44 - up education
60:45 - uh i would say you don't need this right
60:48 - here
60:49 - for education what do you think daniel
60:55 - so one is uh what is this what is this
60:58 - institute
60:59 - what is that you know what i'm not sure
61:02 - where she's from but i know
61:03 - some obviously some people have like
61:05 - different uh yeah education structures
61:07 - but i think it goes towards what you
61:09 - were saying before
61:10 - you really need to put like the last
61:12 - thing you're in like when i was in
61:13 - university
61:14 - i didn't have my high school stuff i
61:16 - just had my current university stuff
61:17 - because that's what it looks like the
61:19 - esprit that's where she's currently at
61:21 - right she has to june 2021
61:23 - so i think unless preparatory institute
61:26 - of engineering studies is like the best
61:28 - goddamn engineering school ever like the
61:30 - mit or the stanford
61:31 - then i don't think you probably want to
61:33 - mention yeah then
61:35 - then in that case i would say just keep
61:36 - the latest sponsor whatever the latest
61:37 - one is
61:38 - i would say keep that one right so let
61:40 - me go ahead and actually remove that for
61:41 - some reason i crossed it out but
61:42 - you get my point so make sure just just
61:46 - get the one that you that was the latest
61:47 - one that's it okay
61:49 - okay for the achievements honestly i
61:51 - think it's pretty cool what do you think
61:51 - about the achievements portion
61:54 - yeah other i mean it looks like she went
61:56 - deep into the european innovation
61:58 - academy which is awesome then the other
61:59 - ones maybe they don't have them in
62:01 - details
62:01 - but i would just say similar to what we
62:03 - mentioned before just make sure that
62:04 - formatting is similar to the education
62:06 - to the projects and to the work
62:07 - experience
62:10 - um yeah yeah so somebody asked where can

64:55 - do that for you
64:56 - since uh we got no time for that
65:00 - we ain't got no time for that simple as
65:02 - that already giving you a lot of value
65:05 - let's go so okay pros and cons what do
65:08 - you think are the pros
65:10 - the pros again i see
65:14 - good sections which makes it easy to
65:16 - read okay so yeah i would say the
65:18 - prosperous is easy to read i would
65:20 - i i would agree with that yes so
65:23 - easy easy easy easy to read
65:27 - to read okay okay what's another one
65:30 - what's another pro another pro
65:34 - right off the bat my i mean i think it's
65:36 - cool that he's highlighting
65:38 - well actually that's not right that
65:39 - one's not a pro um the work experience
65:41 - is a pro
65:42 - that it's very close to being a software
65:44 - developer i mean it is literally being a
65:46 - software developer
65:47 - so it's cool that he's able to highlight
65:49 - that and it looks like he goes deep into
65:51 - the details but
65:52 - we'll go in and dissect that in a bit
65:59 - so yeah so work experience is nicely
66:01 - highlighted which i love that portion i
66:03 - love that portion okay
66:05 - okay let's not now let's talk about the
66:07 - cons
66:08 - or the cons okay okay um
66:12 - the projects dude like what the actual
66:15 -  man yeah like
66:16 - this an instagram clone yeah you built
66:19 - a whatsapp clone and you created
66:23 - fun projects dot i n yeah and all you're
66:26 - like dude
66:27 - give me some context these
66:29 - are like some
66:30 - juicy projects that i want to know about
66:33 - what's going on brother this right here
66:35 - is your money
66:36 - you're on the money right here bro this
66:39 - is your money
66:41 - it's the money it's the money
66:44 - it's the money bro so look what i want
66:47 - you to do is i want you
66:48 - you to expand on projects i want you to
66:51 - not only say
66:52 - i want you to expand on the project just
66:54 - how you did here you see this right here
66:55 - math works
66:56 - i want you to do in the exactly the same
66:58 - way and it is
66:59 - exactly the same way so for example you
67:02 - can say
67:03 - right you can say insta so for example
67:05 - because the instagram clone
67:07 - right and underneath that you could say
67:09 - for example so created
67:11 - created or developed developed
67:14 - and you know an insta instagram
67:17 - instagram
67:18 - clone using your xjs using react.js
67:22 - react gs for learning purposes
67:28 - boom right there see so i want you to go
67:31 - down as deep
67:32 - as this and then for example you can say
67:33 - technology is used right so i'm not sure
67:35 - technologies you use here
67:37 - challenge is used and so i want you to
67:39 - expand on that okay i want to expand
67:41 - your projects
67:42 - is your value and then put down your
67:44 - github so then you say for example
67:45 - github
67:46 - okay and then you then then you say
67:49 - github
67:50 - then you say also you can say for
67:51 - example your link or your
67:53 - your uh your live link right
67:57 - and the other thing i would add to this
67:58 - so guys i'm a huge proponent of
68:02 - if you go through these clones don't
68:03 - just do the clones give yourself
68:05 - nice challenges of features that you can
68:08 - add to the clones because that's where
68:09 - you're really going to learn a lot
68:11 - so if you do add those features those
68:13 - could be the extra tabs
68:15 - right along with those things talk about
68:17 - what you did in that process because
68:18 - i mean if i'm being honest just because
68:21 - you followed a tutorial
68:23 - doesn't really like you get to see some
68:26 - behind the scenes but that's not really
68:27 - your project
68:28 - now someone else's project that you're
68:29 - able to follow so you actually get that
68:31 - experience and you get that ownership
68:33 - when you build out a specific feature
68:35 - that you thought about for example the
68:37 - amazon clone
68:38 - i'm not too familiar with all the
68:39 - features but imagine you built one
68:41 - where you get to see all of your order
68:44 - history yeah right
68:45 - i don't know the amazon already had that
68:46 - no no no no no no okay
68:48 - perfect so you build out that feature so
68:50 - you need a back end where you have to
68:52 - put the orders every time someone does a
68:53 - fake purchase or whatever
68:55 - and keep all the order history and it
68:56 - shows it nice now you can talk about
68:58 - that and be like
68:59 - fully integrated you know fully
69:01 - integrated a back end to this
69:03 - application using whatever firebase
69:06 - whatever
69:06 - database you use yeah yeah i would agree
69:08 - with that 100 agree with that man
69:10 - 100 good that guy so yeah
69:13 - add extra features to your projects okay
69:16 - next up let's go ahead and take a look
69:18 - at so your another thing that i would
69:20 - say
69:20 - remove this right here so your high
69:22 - school is not necessarily needed anymore
69:23 - just talk about your indian institute of
69:25 - information technology that is all you
69:27 - need
69:27 - your high school nobody cares about i do
69:30 - want to say this not because i've
69:31 - noticed this from the previous ones
69:33 - is they said that in india they care a
69:36 - lot about the academics okay
69:38 - so i think i think there's a caveat
69:39 - there i think if it's for uh work in
69:41 - india
69:42 - that might be different but if it's a
69:43 - work united states you don't need your
69:45 - high school your college
69:46 - should be enough for united states
69:48 - probably not necessarily exactly so
69:50 - finances part
69:51 - i like your for example now i do like
69:53 - your website here i do like your github
69:54 - here i do like your linkedin that is
69:56 - great
69:56 - um but though what i would say is when
69:59 - actually it's printed out a lot of the
70:01 - times like it's not actually going to be
70:03 - you know you can actually add proper
70:05 - links so add proper links on here
70:08 - you know what i mean so add proper links
70:11 - because when you print it out it's not
70:13 - going to be a link
70:16 - right do you go with me on that one yeah
70:19 - yeah yeah like if you want to go to the
70:21 - github
70:21 - it'd be like github.com
70:27 - or whatever that ends up looking like
70:28 - yes i agree and it's like
70:30 - they they can't just like press on this
70:32 - paper okay and it takes
70:34 - next up your next up your interest
70:36 - promote that please
70:39 - okay your interest no i don't care for
70:43 - your interest bro
70:44 - i'm sorry i'm sorry i just don't
70:48 - i care about what you've done and you're
70:50 - saying and what they've said
70:52 - exactly what not said before and they're
70:53 - saying in the comments for your interest
70:55 - that's things that you could talk about
70:56 - in the interview
70:57 - if they come up yes you can talk about
71:00 - that in the interview exactly but they
71:02 - are going to initially look at
71:03 - specifically what
71:04 - and hobbies ah you don't need that as
71:06 - well like pull you know
71:08 - pull cooker and you know i'm not sure
71:10 - what that means but cook pull cooker
71:12 - um so again all this you can remove
71:16 - all this stuff you can remove and that
71:18 - way you can actually go
71:19 - and make it one page okay so remove that
71:22 - stuff you don't really need that i'm
71:23 - sorry you just really don't
71:25 - okay let's continue on so i want to
71:29 - achievements oh you're a tedx speaker no
71:32 -  way
71:33 - oh bro we got greatness
71:36 - among us wow that's insane
71:39 - let's go shout out
71:43 - yo that is insane we got
71:47 - greatness in the house yes
71:50 - so i'm not sure what you touched on but
71:52 - i think that is amazing so the fact that
71:54 - give a tedx talk
71:55 - honestly keep that keep the achievements
71:57 - as a tedx speaker
71:58 - that is amazing recognition at ie it
72:02 - um not sure kanapur my dashboard was
72:05 - featured on the home page
72:06 - okay you can talk about that as well but
72:08 - what i would say for example is to
72:10 - move this up right so you can probably
72:12 - remove some spacing to make sure that
72:14 - these are up
72:15 - okay
72:18 - vice chair and best delegate awards and
72:20 - multiple
72:21 - model united nations conferences damn
72:24 - holy damn bro damn that's the cp
72:28 - community for you brother that's insane
72:30 - so i love that looks like you've got
72:31 - some amazing projects you've got some
72:33 - amazing experience okay
72:34 - on you pretty much what you're missing a
72:36 - shot is you're missing
72:38 - number one the project so you make sure
72:40 - you basically expand on those projects
72:42 - that's pretty much all you're missing
72:43 - and then let's go and take a look at
72:45 - your now um
72:46 - you know let your your work experience
72:49 - okay
72:52 - let's take a look workspace so it looks
72:54 - like mathworks bangalore c plus plus
72:56 - software developer i like that so it's
72:58 - pretty clear
72:59 - it looks like you're from february to
73:00 - present that's pretty easy to read as
73:01 - well
73:02 - um oil enhancement so own and enhanced
73:05 - meth works infrastructure
73:06 - messaging to support async workflows
73:08 - with return
73:09 - values so i love that the word enhanced
73:12 - right there enhanced okay enhanced
73:15 - so here's i would say out enhanced
73:20 - enhanced
73:23 - so you know you know we've been going at
73:26 - it for a while when we just started
73:27 - laughing at these words dude
73:29 - i'm hunched
73:33 - okay okay so great so here's what i
73:36 - want you to do here literally is this
73:39 - own and enhanced i don't know i'm not
73:41 - sure what owned the means
73:43 - but when you own something what i would
73:45 - say is
73:46 - this right here enhancement nobody
73:48 - really cares about
73:49 - just specifically say enhanced math
73:52 - works
73:53 - infrastructure or messaging to support
73:55 - async workflows with return values
73:57 - and you don't need to have all this
73:58 - other stuff honestly
74:02 - okay okay you do not need to have all
74:06 - this other stuff
74:08 - the bug facing as well nobody cares
74:10 - about this stuff this bug fixing
74:12 - right we don't need that and in terms of
74:14 - data major architecture given
74:16 - yeah in terms of in terms of creating a
74:18 - major um
74:20 - major re-architecture of glim i think
74:22 - there's something there so here's what
74:23 - you can say here
74:24 - here you can say things like and let me
74:26 - tell you here
74:27 - here you can see things like you know
74:29 - increased developer efficiency
74:34 - developer efficiency
74:40 - buy by re architecting glim
74:48 - our internal internal tool
74:51 - really i'm not sure where glenn is but
74:53 - you get my point you get
74:55 - my point okay and so this and that's it
74:57 - so we talked about
74:58 - just it this glim you know talking about
75:01 - what glim is
75:02 - you can talk about that on the actual
75:05 - you can talk about on the actual
75:06 - interview
75:06 - so they might ask you here what what is
75:08 - glim right what is glim and so you get
75:10 - the chance hey
75:11 - glim is this this this is this what it
75:13 - does and this is what we worked on right
75:15 - and this is why it's so important so
75:18 - that's what i would say
75:19 - is is have room to talk about something
75:24 - you see what i mean yeah so either
75:26 - someone who's familiar with
75:27 - math work products is gonna be like oh
75:29 - i've seen glimpse yeah i know what that
75:30 - is
75:31 - they can ask you detailed questions or
75:32 - someone who's not they might be like oh
75:34 - interesting oh my bad
75:35 - oh interesting what is this glimpting
75:37 - and then you just like oh cool it's this
75:39 - cool
75:40 - you know inter-threading yeah messaging
75:42 - structure
75:43 - yeah used under the hood of the entire
75:45 - line of math works products
75:46 - exactly oh my god that's dope exactly so
75:48 - so somebody said the gist is use less
75:51 - verbage to
75:52 - highlight your experience it's as simple
75:53 - as that yeah use less rubbish to
75:55 - highlight your experience
75:57 - that's it guys okay next up we
76:00 - have let me see so that's what i would
76:02 - do for that specific work experience

76:42 - like depends on what position you're
76:44 - applying for you might not even need
76:45 - this
76:46 - otherwise what i would say is combine

79:00 - protected company company computers
79:07 - by creating i'm not sure what what
79:10 - specifically happened by creating
79:11 - malicious
79:15 - malicious url detection systems
79:20 - what do you think about that one
79:23 - protected company computers
79:25 - result by creating malicious url
79:28 - detection systems
79:29 - action perfect follow the guidelines
79:31 - that's it
79:32 - create a lifetime intelligence dashboard
79:34 - a lot to the analyze
79:35 - next yeah also look analyze and tracked
79:38 - real-time cyber threats prevailing role
79:40 - uh
79:40 - so here here i would say analyzed what
79:43 - actually here i'll have you do this one
79:45 - what do you think about about this uh

84:56 - projects let's go
85:00 - honestly guys if it's a job or an
85:02 - internship if you just build a project
85:05 - you build a technical skill set and the
85:07 - projects are something that you could
85:08 - show people
85:09 - you're gonna grab eyeballs you're gonna
85:11 - grab attention whether it's an
85:12 - internship
85:13 - whether it's a freelancing gig whether

Cleaned transcript:

and we are live what is up everybody i hope you guys are doing amazing get ready get pumped because today we are talking about the resume that got me into google microsoft blue origin but most importantly we most importantly we are talking about we're going to review your resumes guys and i'm here today with my amazing friend daniel savard what is up man how are you doing yo i am doing wonderful how are you guys doing well you guys by you we're doing we're do we're we're doing amazing hope you guys are doing great let's get really honestly we're going to jump straight into it because i do not want to waste time at all i seriously just want to i know i don't miss time at all we're literally just going to jump in straight into reviewing these resumes and talking about and you know so if you submit a resume actually before we're going to look into those for you and we'll tell you how to fix them we'll go deep down on how to fix them that's what you're here to do because we want to get you that review or that that interview with that job we want to get you that job opportunity and that's what we are here to do isn't that right daniel that is exactly right so guys if you've seen this before we're quickly going to go through the slides we've always talked about nazis dancing i know what he's doing but if you haven't we're going to give you that quick background as to why we're talking about resumes and what you can do to start to build your resume and then boom we'll get into the awesome reviews so let's do it now exactly really quickly i like i said we're gonna jump you probably a lot of you guys have potentially just have seen all this at this point you know so like we're not going to touch base too much on this but all i will tell you is the fact that you know how to build your resume really quickly we're gonna really fly through this okay we're going to fly through this like fly fly like fly to the to the moon i'm proud of myself so how to build your resume you know and how to land those jobs 10 times faster right where have we had interviewed right you know daniel where have you ever interviewed right man to be honest right out of college i only applied to three different places which are blue origin google and microsoft and because of my awesome resume i was able to land an interview and actually because of the interviewing skills i was able to land the job so what we're going to try to teach you at least for my site is offer my perspective my advice to be able to get you those awesome resumes you could start to build that will then allow you to then land the amazing interviews and then all these other awesome yeah all these other companies that you're going to see right here this is obviously not because nod knows exactly what he's doing he did a lot of work as a freelancer and he got to work with a lot of companies so he got to interview at twitter palantir squarespace and microsoft as well so i'm not i just let them know why all these companies are here basically we've gone through the interview processes of all these different companies and it was our resumes that allowed us to get into that step at least yes exactly all these resumes right we were able i was able to get interviews with companies like square you know squarespace volunteer twitter you know google as well and then you know same thing something here same same thing here with with daniel and what we did is we what was interesting is our resumes were reviewed by amazing people you know you know we learned we learned from from other people right you know other people that were already working exactly like those companies they were working at those companies that is why we are here to transfer that knowledge to you okay to you exactly so let's go ahead and get started let's go next up why building a strong resume is important most companies don't even go ahead oh i'm just gonna say it's important because i mean how else do they know who you are right it's like no one knows who you are in this world especially if you're trying to get a job unless you have some sort of paper maybe that's only one page long that summarizes what you've done specifically so go ahead and get into what you're gonna do yeah yeah yeah of course you need to stand out from the crowd that's number one right because you have hundreds of thousands of developers applying every single day so how do you stand out the crowd how do you as that you know the particular person who has got all that knowledge and has got all the experience how do you do that how do you stand out and so that is why you got to send out with at least something like your resume your projects of course and of course of course your resume correct so that's what we're here to teach you how to stand how do you stand out so of course the first thing you need to talk about or you need to know is the sections on you know that you need to have in your resume very important daniel because i want to just notice this how many pages does a resume need to have um i don't know nas this is a really tough one come on girl come on bro you got this come on you got this come on come on come on you got this i think it's one i think it's the one let's go so guys you need to have you need you need one page only honestly please because i i receive all these resumes from you guys and it's like 10 pages okay no please keep it to one that is all you need all right that is all my friends that you need so also awesome so let's keep going so the sections okay some what let's go ahead and go through some of the sections that you need tell me uh here uh daniel perfect perfect so honestly depending on what experience you have you're going to want to highlight different ones right so as you can see these different sections to be honest if you don't have work experience being a developer before then that's not what you want to highlight instead you're going to want to highlight potentially your projects or your awards that you've shown you've been able to build something something of value that you actually develop sort of software and it's applicable to the job but it's still important to have these different sections so that when someone looks at your resume they could easily find what they're looking for oh salman salman someone just donated thank you so much canadian five dollar super chat if you guys are interested i create a react js modern looking resume and portfolio project hope it helps everyone of course if you go ahead and put a link somewhere down below or something like where or link to your video series go ahead put it down below we'll love we'll love to shout you out i would love to show you out and here let me go ahead and actually add him to the broadcast so you can see yep and and this is this is the beautiful thing about the clever programmer community man i mean if you're here to add value we will more than happily put you in front of everyone because you're gonna add value so like you made a video series man that is completely awesome i want to take advantage of that go ahead go through series probably awesome yeah so put your link down below and then i think we should be all good awesome so thanks so much salman let's go ahead and keep going we'll give you an edge here all all right all right bro all right all right so cool let's go ahead and keep going next up so you got awards you got next time of course you need to have those projects okay those are probably one of the most most important things you need to have right why projects specifically because why oh you're asking you're asking i'm asking why projects i'm testing you bro that's oh man this this quiz is hard guys it's hard projects is probably where you can actually highlight specific skill sets that you've been able to develop because you build something for a job right so if you're applying for web frontend developer using react you could show them a portfolio of specific react projects you've built and that shows them like you don't even have to tell them but that literally shows them the skill set that you have now if you know how to translate that and tell them through the resume that's even more bonus points exactly exactly because the thing is you know what you need to understand is the fact that what you need to understand is it's pretty simple like you know you can say that you worked at this company or you can say that you work at this company but at the end of the day what you understand is your projects is what back up your skills it's as simple as that your projects back up your skills period okay period and so you have to get those straight guys if you don't have projects build projects if you do have projects put them on github so really important right i want to say you know is you know put them you know have make sure you have them on github as well make sure if you have a project that's live live project as well so basically the actual link to the live project that would be amazing as well okay so put them on github put it as a live project and that's it that's all you need okay so awesome so what we've done through the projects and we'll tell you how to specifically you know how to format them we'll talk about that here in a second but let's go continue on so work experience let's go next one work experience work experience so guys if you've done work experience in the software realm then you definitely want to highlight it now if you really haven't you might still be able to pick up potentially other skills that you've been able to get from those jobs that might apply for example i don't know maybe if you were a manager at mcdonald's you can maybe highlight that as a manager you were able to work with people lead a team but it's going to be very limited because what you do want to have the majority of the section be the actual technical stuff that you've worked on so if it is applicable make sure you make sure to add it and find that angle that which you can make it work for you exactly beautiful of course an education if you have education if you do not have education that's completely okay i just want to let you know guys that is completely okay you know but if you do have it you know put it on there and you you should be great um and then oh dang someone just donate again i can't put the links on the chat but if you search up my name on react.js resume dang someone you're just killing it of course those ten dollars are going to return oh yeah a lot more for you brother because you're providing value if you provide value the money just comes it's crazy even as a developer you can provide value to a business the money just comes with the big salary with the big paycheck exactly so thank you so much salman all right let's go ahead and continue on and of course if you have a reference a reference what is a reference a reference is someone seriously that pretty much references a person that can you know that can go ahead and support you so for example they will call that reference for example maybe it's someone you worked with before or someone you know they will actually call their reference and ask hey you know how is it to work with this person so make sure it's someone that you trust and they can say actually a good thing instead of saying do not put down someone who hates you i think that's a really important part yeah and i guess another tip is if you don't have someone on top of mind or you kind of want to see how they're feeling about it you could also just say you know willing to provide reference or something like that right if you don't have someone's contact information right off the bat that's another option you can do exactly exactly cool so go ahead and continue on so next things how to build how to mistake how to build mistakes so mistakes we know which one nas is really passionate about it's pretty obvious i know it's i know it's pretty simple the one i'm just really passionate about because i'm just it gets me so pissed guys it's like please do not make it more than one page and make it you know only one page do not make it three four pages two pages no recruiter has the time to go through that okay so just that's the one main thing to understand no recruiter has the time to go through that okay exactly and the second thing you want to avoid all right is there there's a fine line between being so fancy that it's so distracting and you're not highlighting the important stuff and also being so simplistic that you're not highlighting anything that everything just looks blah like no throw up on paper so you just want to find that line that's just very simple and it highlights the things that you wanted to hide so let's get jump straight into we've got we've talked a little bit about the resumes what you should and shouldn't do are you ready for those resume reviews let's go let's go bro let's go so really simple here really simple here we're going to go through your resumes there are right here someone says some of uh obviously just became your 500 subscriber nice nice nice nice somebody john john asks can you use your instructor for reference yes you can yes you can make ask him ask him if like ask him hey can i use you for reference and just let him know that's it okay that's it uh all right cool so let's go ahead and continue on so i have a lot of resumes as you can see here right that people have submitted and there's a lot of for us to go through and the question is like what do you want to go through so what do you think huh um but i was responding over here you're asking what do we want to do let's uh i guess we didn't prescreen them so it's it's kind of like a lottery lottery thing i guess i kind of kind of want to go through this one all right let's do it i'm gonna minimize your screen so i can maximize this yeah let's go through this one yes oh and guys don't take any offense to this yes this is us just letting you know our thoughts what we would do if we laugh don't take any offense right we're just trying to have a good time here right because we're gonna laugh because we're gonna laugh and that's fine we laughed at our own like if i pulled up my very first resume i would have pointed at myself and laughed so hard and the dude probably would have peed his pants from all the laughing that was being done to him right so don't take any offense and he literally literally stands we love you guys so take this with you know uh uh an open an open mind exactly exactly i would say so so okay let's look at this so it looks like d show right here so let's take a look at your resume okay really quickly here right off the bat oh right here so i didn't show them the the screen just yet so there we go now you guys see it so right off the bat what do we what are we seeing here what do you think okay um so first thing for me i at least from the experience i've had pictures don't really work right because what that allows them to do is that allows them to already i guess i don't know was it prejudge you before they even start looking at anything just because of how you look so even if you look professional there's already some i guess uh what are those called uh so because of the whole black lives matter there's a lot of researchers that start looking into like i guess pre uh things that you already judge of just because of like for example their their skin color or their background or ethnicity or whatever that may be so me personally i've never seen pictures i don't know what's your take on that no i haven't heard your take on that before yeah i would say i'll say as well pictures are not necessary that's not why you you know you put this on your resume so say remove your pictures honestly you know that's that's the main thing right so um they know how you look like they don't you things like that you shouldn't put on your resume that that's just as simple as that okay um second thing that pops out to me we talked about not being too fancy yeah i feel like maybe this show is trying to be a little fancy with that background and it's too distracting it's hard to read yeah the actual letters because it's just like these so remove the background remove the background very important so guys make sure make sure to remove the background guys and you got a lot of you guys are talking about the content guys we told people that you know go ahead and remove your contact because it will be shown to everybody so honestly the contact is is fine if people submit it to our resume that means they are completely okay with showing the contact okay so don't go ahead and hate on us for showing the contact we let people know remove your contact beforehand okay okay beautiful so so when i when we when we say fanciness this fancy colors right here are necessary not necessary at all these fancy colors i don't need no fancy colors at all so remove that just make it plain white okay plain white and that is it okay uh no someone i would say you know remove uh no some of that is not right still remove your picture someone i don't agree with you still remove the picture okay stimulate the picture so let's go ahead and continue on so remove that part i don't need don't you specifically need the background at all the name here pretty that's fine then i have no no problem with this that's fine education um let me see what about education what do you think uh let's see education i feel like so there's two things because on the left i see that she's saying i'm a student which is part of the education on the right i feel like it's just taking a lot of space as well yeah so yeah so i feel like that could definitely be simplified yeah so i think a little bit of simplification interest education here you don't need to talk about your classes 11 through 12. i would say just talk about where you your latest education that's it that's it exactly okay just relay the latest education talk about your latest right your latest latest hold on latest education okay may that be college whatever it be if you actually if you have here's the cool part if you have experience like prior experience you don't you if you don't have experience you don't actually need need education period that's it okay you don't actually need education that is a new experience it looks like disha is still you know she's still she's still in 12th grade and so forth she still learned a lot um skills fast learners so this seems like by someone who's still like in high school that which is completely fine you know but it's still good something good to learn so skills fast learner uh st things like that honestly what about what do you think about this we don't need this stuff right here i'm a certified ethical hacker i'm sports you know we don't need that you know what skills you have talk specifically go ahead daniel yeah i think i was about to say exactly what you're about to say which is talk about a project you've built if you haven't built a project go build some projects right start to gain that experience but when you talk about those projects it's what have you said before the proof is in the pudding it's like the proof is in the pudding exactly so go talk about projects if you don't have projects talk about go build projects and we have a shitload of tutorials on that especially when it comes to react javascript learn whatever that is so you could go through the channel start to build those things and you would start to develop some insane technical skills that you probably wouldn't even develop at a regular boot camp exactly sweet so let's continue on really and that's honestly that's pretty much it you don't need to change i mean honestly that's just just change that part and add add some skills add projects that is all you need for for this right so let me see add add projects right that is the most important thing and that's it guys okay so i think we're kind of we're done with this resume what do you think i think yeah i think we're doing this resume okay cool so disha you are all good let's go and continue on next up who do you think could be next next next next next next next we see we have zhanesh uh hold on we had a special request from someone in the audience what's his name uh to review theirs look up mauro mauro is it mauro mauro mau or the mau okay i like it okay okay let's take a look at this okay i like this this is cool so all right i'm seeing some zoom in i zoom into this one all right so i love honestly okay so let's see let's look at this look looks looks familiar looks pretty familiar to what maybe someone here has interesting so i got your name i like that okay i got the fact that you know it's really easy to read so number one i would say pretty pretty easy to read and which is why like right you got your technical skills your projects you know basically it's easy to follow that's that's the thing right so it's easy easy to follow right that is the most important thing right if you look at a resume and your resume and you can specifically say you guys are saying boring yes but boring boring like resumes like this actually is what gets you the job yep well the interview i mean or the interview the interview right not the job the interview here's why because it doesn't matter how fancy the resume is what matter it matters is the words what matters is how fast can the recruiter right how fast can a recruiter read your resume how fast right can they read your resume right how many how many seconds do you think they have nods or how many seconds you think they spend just looking at your resume they literally have five seconds five seconds to look at your resume and decide if it's gonna go or not that's it only five seconds and if you're gonna add some crazy colors and and and fancy and be like and animations and they'll just show them you know just like you know and everything just kind of blends in you know then it's not going to work out so well so it's very important just keep it simple that is the most important part okay continue on that's nice let's go and continue with this one i think on this one we could dive into the details just to kind of talk about you know you always talk about making them action oriented i mean also if you look it looks like he's starting off with this project instead of his work experience again so i'm curious what his work experience looks like yeah yeah exactly so let's go ahead and say so we got projects which is really cool as well and then let me see projects and then his education it doesn't have oh like work experience is on the bottom as well and it's an offset texas that's i love it i love it i love it so hold on we're seeing okay it's because it was a little lagged on without seeing all right we're good we're good you see it now yeah actually no beautiful okay great so so projects okay cool so create it looks like let me see so you got a twitter showcase react.js twitter expenses expenses tracker app so you got the twitter showcase okay snake game app okay you got the expenses yeah the twitter showcase app i will say do listen to like a twitter clone app like uh trying to change this name instead of being is this is this what is this a twitter showcase is this a twitter app or what uh potentially i don't think that's a clone one because he's using different technology there no he's still using node i don't think that's our our twitter clone i think that's a difference okay if it's a twitter clone i would say twitter clone because i'm not i'm not sure what showcase is like like what is showcase you know what i mean so that's what you need to understand so what is show showcase gotcha so the project itself has an ambiguous name exactly next up let's let's look look into the actual things he said so create a static what ui that allows users to what to search for tweets by sending http requests to an external api insert my website using node express utilize npm scripts to set up a dev environment create an internal or um an internal oh you know correct that part right here yeah correct that part make sure um api to communicate and grab data from external api utilize the twitter api to retrieve and display tweets based on the user's content search a random type tweet from a selection if i use this one put this one on the top right there utilize twitter api to retrieve and display tweets based on the user content based on based on user search or random tweet from a section of five and that's it you don't need this as well right making that sense because that is that's basically that is probably the most important bullet you have you want to make sure that's the top one all the things are like small things that you had to do for that yeah so make this on the top one okay the purpose of this app was to help okay i understand the entire fullstack process and hone in on my technical skills i like this this is i mean this is pretty cool what do you think about that dude he followed the process yeah he literally has he he literally has his resume template and then he just you probably watched our videos and did what we say to do exactly exactly so this stuff i like you don't need to have all of this other stuff honestly this right here you don't need to have all this what do you think about this one i think that's a good point because a lot of those things are kind of like you know served my website using node and express yeah it's kind of like a given when you set up a website yeah right the the creating static files especially like the html and the css that's also kind of a given when you're creating websites so i think you're right i think those last bullets yeah the ones that actually grasp what actually happened of yeah exactly the challenge of this project what was learned yeah exactly so you do not need specifically to say that like create an aesthetic file you either allows you to search for tweets or you can say for example created an application well you you said here us with api to retrieve and display tweets based on user search that's it like that's pretty much it right i would say focus mainly on that for this for example for this app so for this app and again the reason why is because you want to focus on a few bullet points instead of trying to do everything all at once right that's the whole segment exactly all right next up so what do we got create a ui that allows users to track expenses and help improve spending habits i like that static file i'm not sure what that means static file uh so i think the advice is probably gonna be similar like take up the static file yeah um create a ui utilize yeah the fourth one which is like utilize npm scripts to set up dev environment yeah maybe i don't know how important that dev environment stuff is but i don't think no it's not yeah i would say not no yeah so similar similar advice to the other one it's like you could clean out some things to really focus on the main the beef of the project yeah i would say here credit ui that allows users to track expenses and help improve spending habits that is great create application that which with classbased components and that's also i think and this as well it's pretty pretty cool too right because you talk about you know what specifically you use i think you know um well honestly i'm not sure about this what do you think about this wait which one are we talking about this one create application with webbased components difference the objects utilize props um so i feel like those are already reactings right yeah they're kind of given yeah um i think that could probably be changed a little bit more because it looks like this might have been his first react project yeah so maybe he's trying to show that that's what he learned in this project so maybe i don't know if there's a way to be like oh okay like you know if this is the first project where i did react these were the things that i learned or if it's even worth doing that but i think that's what he's trying to do with this yeah i would say so too as well so i would say for this one for example you could say create an application create utilizing um up to date react here here's how i would say here's how i would say it right i would say created an application created the application application utilizing all uh all the up to date all the up to uh all up to date to up damn it up to date react.js features that's it like components right components um props and state so what do you think about that i like that because it includes like hey these are the things that i did in this specific case and i think it could bring up that conversation yeah in in in the interview that it's like hey this is where i first learned react and i was able to dive deep into learning components props states everything that has to do with react exactly so that's why i like that so i would say remove that and then exchange it with this and then remove these other ones like we use the npm for this you know utilizing react for this we don't necessarily need that okay and then so that's all good i like i like that part let's go ahead and talk about the snake game so let's see create a classic 2d version let's see 2d version okay let me see of the snake game built with javascript html you said okay utilize for loops um don't need this again or this as well the deploy to github pages you do not need to tell me do you deploy to github pages because i know that this is on github pages you know what i mean right so we don't necessarily need this right but for something for example like create a classic todo version of the snake game billboard javascript i think that's fine what do you think i think that's good man i mean i think he was trying to showcase and highlight specific things that are already given as part of the project and those are things that he could talk about in the interview if it comes up but no one's gonna be like hey did you learn uh for loops you know what i mean yeah yeah it's exactly that's that's something a little more fundamental but i think still i think if we could start to remove these things that's great that gives them more room to add more projects exactly like an amazon clone or something yeah so awesome so let's go and take a look at now your specific uh actual job so service service direct okay i like how for example here the pros of this because i'm going to state the pros here you know it's clear uh clear dates right like clear dates and a very clear you know uh you know format so you know i know for example that you were working as a data analyst and i are still working as data analyst you know at service direct in austin texas you know since august 2018. so and and i think this is a great example of something you touched up a lot on nas but if you notice look how his his work and his background have nothing to do with computer science so he puts them on the bottom but he highlights the projects that he's built yes so he puts those on the top exactly because he was this is he wants to get a developer position is it i'm sure that that's that's the goal yeah we i mean we figure right yeah that's why he's here like he doesn't have a computer science degree and people here are saying i don't have computer science degree i look edwin said that in the chat look edwin i bet you anything this person can land a job because he's showcasing his experience he's putting in the work doesn't have a computer science degree and i guarantee he'd be able to land a job if he just keeps going at it exactly exactly cool so yeah so go ahead and put your projects up front this is why i talk so much about that specific aspect right put your project up front guys cool let's talk about a little bit now okay the text here so data analyst transform data into readable goaldriven reports for continued innovation and growth uh through google day studio okay okay i don't know what the that is but all right all right in order to draw conclusions for managerial actions and strategy okay all right so so for example here how i would do it is for example here here's how i would say here so we want to talk about results plus action right so we want to talk about results right results plus action right and i'm sure you already know this at this point but here's how i would state yours i would say for example uh helped with uh helped improve managerial managerial actions and strategies so improved remember that keyword right improved right improved and created increased decrease that is what you want to look at so we want to say improved managerial actions and strategy by by interpreting printing interpreting google data studio data there we go google data studio what i like it i just like the double right there google data studio that's it that's it right there right perfect right and then you can say for example created goaldriven reports for continuous innovation through google critic created for example you can say created created goal driven reports event reports general reports for continuous innovation boom innovation done that's it okay uh then you say uh for then you talk about developed and implied data analysis data cluster systems and also to them to to optimize statistical efficiency and quality so here i would say i would say optimize statistical efficiency and quality by develop by implementing data analysis and data collection so here i would say exactly so go ahead basically to summarize what's going on here is there's two things you always want to have in each sentence what was the action yes what was the result it makes it even better it's a bonus if you could start with the results and then talk about the action so right here moto what you have is you have the action that you took and the result that you got but if you just start with that results like any marketing thing if you start the result it's just a little bit better exactly that's what i would say i would i would say as well so so here for example what i would say is is where would i say this hold on i would say optimize statistical efficiency and quality optimized efficiency you guys might not see that at this point efficiency and quality right yeah right through the develop by implementing data analysis and data collection systems that's it exactly so the result was optimized efficiency and quality what was the action i developed he developed and implemented the anatomy and so guys if you now look at right if you look at you know when a recruiter now looks at your stuff you can see they see created they see improved and they see optimize and right away it's like oh this guy is very interesting and he created the right went ahead and created what are you laughing at bro oh this guy is very interesting that's exactly what they say so do what nazi's telling you exactly hey hey i have music here so you know hey yo you can't hear the music unfortunately bro but just imagine there's some epic music going on all right i have to buy myself that cool thing you know on the right hand side that like uh yeah what's it called let's go all right so we have went ahead and we reviewed your resume so go ahead improve it and we will see you but no actually not let's continue on that's all i'll say yo so there's two people that are live in youtube i just sent you through slack nas okay they're uh their names so i say let's uh let's try to get at least those two let's see let's see let's see let's see since they happen to be live oh oh my my computer's like struggling right now oh oh my god please don't die what if your computer dies we're screwed not don't die computer it's the mother ship right now we're relying on it oh my god it's hilarious let me see so it looks like we got hella hella and then akshat okay so hella are you in the chat drop it down the chat if you are in the chat and let me see let me see your uh let me see your uh i don't know she was here a couple minutes ago hella hello let's see if she uh ella just responded let's go ahead and start with him actually okay ella's also there okay ella i said ella first outside it's 2 am there all right all right let's go ahead let's go ella ella ella okay got your next zack shot all right so ella right here let me see so ella's right here to above what what actually there's there's a few ls hold on no that's one hello whoa ella are you tricking us what do you mean you're tricking us oh i know she might have put more resumes it's a little delayed here so i can't the the screen sharing sucks dude no that's because of skype you know that's why okay yeah i have like a five second delay why is this like a hold on why is this wrong with this pdf i'm like it's like it's like not showing me everything holy i need to download that is everything no i need to download the pdf because it's like weird diego calling me out dude what latino power let's go diego what's wrong i don't know i don't get you guys you guys in your and you're uh you're funny funny missus dude la raza bro that's what it's about let's go all right so i think that's good here okay that's perfect so okay ella let's take a look at your resume right here okay so from the pro right away from the top let's talk about some of the pros that i see right away okay uh let's let's think of what what are some of the pros that you see right now some of the pros yeah he sectioned right very easily you could start to see the different sections we got the project we got the education we got the work experience even though there's some sections that i wouldn't agree with like a little bit about me it's very well sectioned easy to read or your eyes can follow through very easily okay yeah pros okay so it's sectioned right so easy to read okay next up it's one damn page let's go hey we've had one pages the whole date i know it's about time guys you know you guys are learning i like it um so okay so low so pros okay i like that i like you're also for example the skills section i think the skill search is pretty cool skill section is good yeah it's very simple like the other one talks about languages frameworks databases tools very simple ah what i just do all right now it's this one's interesting but so you hate when people rate their skills yes right i hate it because i don't get it how do you feel about the languages no i still i still say no just just remove that please for the love of god we do not what does this mean like do you like like no you don't understand bro you do not understand like tell me what does this mean does this mean that you know you know spanish fifty percent of the language what does this mean that means that if i spoke to you fifty percent of the time you wouldn't understand me i agree i don't like the bars i do however think when it comes to languages there's at least like some sort of comprehension dude you could say like all right dude i know basics you'll figure it out on the job you'll figure on the job just say you know spanish and just continue on yeah just just say your no just say your quad language how do you say that that's dope though four languages i love it that is absolutely amazing that is dope that is dope so i think i think that is awesome so languages again just remove that part image as well this is something you will hear from a recruiter you know as well do not put your picture you know you got an amazing picture you know and everything but please you do not need a picture on there honestly you know no no not necessary it's actually a lot of the times actually guys they will actually flag you down like google or something like that they will actually flag you down for putting a picture and the only reason is because it's almost like against the rules it's almost like against uh you know it's almost against uh like um the policies right you should not should not have a picture on there right to not have a picture it's almost like against policies so please remember that please understand that okay and now just really quickly here before i move on i want to show you guys something really quickly here oh wait okay hold on i'm gonna put myself here oh no because i wanna okay is language important remove reading bars okay so remove the braiding box exactly exactly it's gonna continue on okay cool next up what do we have let me see i'm gonna put myself here so i can see god there's just so many yeah okay next up let's talk a little bit about so your skills are great i love your skills that's awesome but what i think okay so skills are awesome let's talk about your let me see what else do we have so we we actually got a quick question about this nozzle i want to get your input um ask aksha asked how do you feel about the resume design do you feel it's more on the fancy side or it's just like it it has a good balance of not too fancy not too personally i actually think it's not bad what do you think yeah i was looking at that too i feel like like at first i was like oh the icons that's interesting to like dictate different things but it's also not too like though the first one that just had a lot of blue and the squares yeah yeah it's very distracting but this really isn't that distracting at all not distracted it's honestly still clean like i can still because for example i can still read i can still read intern and time stop i can still read intern and rapid post right and so forth one thing i would add to here is uh for example what type of an intern are you okay so really important here right remember keywords for example i would say for example i would say the starter developer intern intern right there that's i would say right whatever developer software engineer intern put that on there would you agree with me on that one yeah i mean how do we know you just weren't a janitor yeah exactly time soft right it could have been a parttime janitor for all that yeah so i would say remove that portion exactly no add that portion on there okay but i do love it the cleanness it's honestly honestly it is not overkill you know honestly it's not overkill one thing i would remove is i'll remove interest as well unfortunately because again it's not something a recruiter is not going to look at your interest recorder is going to look at what you know they're going to look at your skills right so once they remove interest because why right don't take that person go ahead well what's up go ahead you talk i was just gonna say hello hello don't take that personally because i also have interest in my resume if you look at it so nas also called me out on it so don't take it personally yeah exactly so they don't care about what your interests are they really care about what skills do you have they care about you know care about about projects the skills right skills you know projects and all that stuff right so that's why that's what i'll say to you you know what i mean so that's what i'll say and uh honestly and then let me see so let's see let's continue on what what does she also have let's continue on so we got intern so if we look at i'm going to zoom in on here for a second just so i can so you guys can read it as well come on zoom it zoom it oh fudge all right this is all we got so it says utilize asp.net core api and angular a to develop and the different critical modules of sba booking tool okay including blah blah okay so it's a little bit oh shoot that's that's very zoomed in it's just a little bit delayed guys my computer oh my god i know my computer is trying hard okay i don't know what's going on here it is struggling my friend yeah somebody said do you don't you think gotchu don't you think the font is too small okay the font what do you think about the font i i really don't know what size it is i mean i i feel you'd want to shoot for like the typical 12 11 maybe but if you start to go any smaller than that i feel like that might just start to be smaller than what you want yeah so i think for here it's fine honestly i think your font is completely fine what i would say to you is so let's i want to change this up i don't like what this is right here i don't like this right here utilize asp.net web api here's what i would say instead what would you say here instead what do you think for intern time software yeah okay so again first thing you want to focus on is the result so as an intern the result you got was authenticating registration using identity core and uh reservation models i'm not sure what that is yeah but i would say what is the result of this sba booking tool right think about this right so you can either say that or you can say for example i codeveloped an sp booking tool using asp.net web api and angular 8. if there is no result but if there is a result for example maybe you know a you know increased company efficiency by develop codeveloping sp book or security or whatever that was exactly whatever your project the results it actually delivered to the security did it increase peace of mind did it do something to help other people yeah that's the result you want to lead with and like how nasa says if you really can't think of that result that's attached to your project you could just talk about the project itself which is developed codevelop spa booking tool exactly and then however not steady yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so that's what i would say is for example i would say here and hella answer the question down below like what is the result of this right what did you do with time stop what was the result so i would say for example co developed developed codeveloped sp booking tool booking tool using asp.net asp.net dot net and angular 8 right angular 8. so that's what i would say right but if there's a result for example maybe increase efficiency or you know of some sort that's what i would say i'll use that in in that case right okay let's go and then if you have any links whatsoever to that tool drop it down below as well that's what i would say it's it's to manage a asp called lela baya okay so for example here you can sue help help management so increased management efficiency right so for example you can say increased i'm not sure increased management efficiency efficiency by by uh what's it called by codeveloping a aspa booking tool right there boom right there what do you think about that increase management efficiency yep and then what you that was the result right so then again what did you do i developed codeveloped spa booking tool and then your next bullet could be the languages used exactly so i think i think that's honestly that is great you know so and then you can say for example underneath you can say hey technology is used let jesus exactly boom right there and you can say angular comma asp.net.net and so forth and boom right there that is all you need that is all you need and do the exact same thing for these other ones as well right so do the exact same things for these other ones let me go ahead and remove that so hopefully you saved that but hopefully you can always rewatch it next time but so do that and then right so do the same thing for this one now what i do like from here i'm not sure if you guys know this but her dates are really good too these are really clear dates right and she keeps consistent dates you see this right here very consistent dates so i love that part what yeah i guess i want to just take it back real quick to the font size because it could be very different on paper than on the computer screen yeah so i would just go back to just actually see what font size it is and in my opinion i wouldn't try to go under 11. just because like i said it might be different on paper because i did notice it was a little bit smaller yeah from the beginning yeah so maybe maybe increase your fonts adjustments yeah like if it's already 11 12 then it's just the computer's looking kind of weird like it'll look good on paper yeah you know what i mean yeah yeah yeah also i would say here you see how it says intern and then real estate market keep these same font right keep these the same font right here oh yeah yeah this is cool keep it consistent what about education where right under does that also have the scene i'm trying to scroll down it's not it's not letting me yeah education yeah this has natural font this has but key keep the headings keep them similar right so keep heading similar and yeah and all the way down to achievements just like exactly keep it the same then it just goes along with the flow of the resume exactly exactly so let me see oh why is this resume it's so hard to read so hard to go through in here okay so let's take a look at now your projects okay your projects and i'm going to go through one project right here really quickly but overall so far a great resume i just want to let you know great resume yeah sylvia asks um sylvia asks so basically resume you need to make it as clear as three or four as much as possible yes yes yes yes exactly look at the next question guys should i go for severe resume the next question yeah i don't know should i go for a cv resume so guys we've talked a lot about this okay just to recap what's the difference for those who don't know the differences okay a resume is a onepage summary of the what you've done literally related to the work a cv is literally everything you've done so with cv can be the things that are like four or five pages right in the united states literally no one asked for a cv so just submit arrest me outside of the united states pay attention to what they're asking for if they specifically want a cv then send in your fortify page cv but mostly they're gonna say cv or resume then just send in the resume because then you don't have to worry about maintaining a fivepage thing yeah so not a cds again what uh it's like latin like curriculum vitamin or something like that which stands for like all the things that you've done in your whole history oh yeah like your entire life you people like like if you worked at mcdonald's you put that there really what i mean yeah i've never had to upload a cv honestly guys only yeah only only upload your resume that's what i would say only upload your resume yeah and actually i just put what it is it's a curriculum vitae that's what it stands for yeah yeah yeah yeah i was like all right damn bro yeah that's crazy by the way guys really quickly here guys we have i know all this stuff we are providing you free content and you know free content and free value that's what we're here to do right and help you guys out by the way we do have a completely free uh netflix clone build so if you want to go ahead and learn how to build a netflix clone we have an epic tutorial down below go ahead and build that project go ahead and learn from that okay so you can put that later on in your portfolio so we completely free okay free training right completely free training on on how to build a netflix clone it's down below in description gonna click the link below check it out subscribe and you know what and then you'll be on your way to even uplifting your resume even more hey let's go let's take it to the next level bro next level okay awesome sweet so uh let me see let's get let's get let's keep going all right so i like this stuff let's go and take a look at now your projects your projects really quickly okay so real estate marketing platform okay real estate market design and development of a web application or real estate platform using spring boot framework okay so so design okay so again use talk here you're talking about design development talk about what you did talk about what you did right what did you do on and in this academic project right so did you for example codeveloped so for example you could say codeveloped dakota developed a a a real estate platform using a codeveloped a real estate platform a web application called a real estate state real estate real right now right real estate pla damn it platform uh web application using spring you can say using springboot as well that's fine all right so you can talk about what did you co develop right and if there was a really cool for example let's say you managed a team right so you can say for example is you know um kept the project on tracked on the project the project on track on track by managing no or by by managing the team or by for example by um by um i would say managing the team is that right daniel what do you think my bad i'm killing the youtube comments right now yeah i know um [Laughter] i'm just telling everyone to build more projects go check out the amazon club go check out the netflix clone go check out all the clones guys all the clothes we got you're gonna crush it all the clothes by the way i have a resume with 12 clones god damn that's gonna be insane what would you say by the way guys smash that thumbs up thumbs up button for us for the youtube algorithm we really would appreciate that let's go ahead and take this video to another level so smash that thumb up thumbs up button subscribe for more videos like this and we'll be all good all right let's continue on so gotcha so you you were asking me about this when the code development yeah for example okay so we said you know kept the project on track by by by managing the team you know can you say that i think we could maybe change the wording of the kept the project on track to maintain the projects trajectory or maintained the project's current pace or something like that obtained the product project trajectory right there maintained the project trajectory i think that's good okay perfect yeah and then what was the what was the action by by managing uh by correctly by correctly managing a team oh damn she managed the whole team no no no no no i'm saying if you did if you did i'm sorry oh yeah i was like let's go because sometimes you know sometimes you're the you're the team like you're the team leader right sometimes you're the team leader so if you were the team leader that is a great thing to put on here right you maintain the project trajectory by correctly managing the team right so that is an amazing wording to put on there it says that you it says that you manage the team it says that you lead you know how to lead people right and that's what people like that is what companies love a leader a leader a warrior leader a killer programmer yes a killer let's go okay i got a musical i got the music that's why i'm doing this but you don't got that you can't you can't dance bro no one else is hearing the music so that's unfair no they do you just don't oh damn for i feel lonely now hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey i'm gonna get back to my youtube comments because i'm crushing it here so oh look i know it's funny it looks like hella did my look this is why i showed this because it's so funny hellas like i actually did did they were all lazy asses see this is why i put this down because i had a hunch that that's probably what happened so make sure to put that down hella okay that they're lazy no not that far my god not that the part that where you manage the team okay lazy asses okay so i love that okay so next up the integrated development project led the development into integration of java development integration journal a desktop app with a mobile app webbased application uh using uh so i would say again spread this up into one word um into one sentence okay so you can put this into two three sentences but the most important thing what i would say for this one is again talk about the result what did you do did you you know let the development of a if a mobile app you of desktop what is the mobile app called or what was the purpose of the mobile if you have a name for it sometimes it's pretty cool just so it's like oh man like you know it's like it's a tangible thing not just some app let the development i like the wording led of a mobile app to improve i don't know a user search i don't know whatever i'm not sure what you did but but you get my point though you get my point right so let development of a mobile app to improve user user user search okay so i like that and then at the bottom you can talk about the technologies you used and so forth boom right there so talk about that next up education uh i would say you don't need this right here for education what do you think daniel so one is uh what is this what is this institute what is that you know what i'm not sure where she's from but i know some obviously some people have like different uh yeah education structures but i think it goes towards what you were saying before you really need to put like the last thing you're in like when i was in university i didn't have my high school stuff i just had my current university stuff because that's what it looks like the esprit that's where she's currently at right she has to june 2021 so i think unless preparatory institute of engineering studies is like the best goddamn engineering school ever like the mit or the stanford then i don't think you probably want to mention yeah then then in that case i would say just keep the latest sponsor whatever the latest one is i would say keep that one right so let me go ahead and actually remove that for some reason i crossed it out but you get my point so make sure just just get the one that you that was the latest one that's it okay okay for the achievements honestly i think it's pretty cool what do you think about the achievements portion yeah other i mean it looks like she went deep into the european innovation academy which is awesome then the other ones maybe they don't have them in details but i would just say similar to what we mentioned before just make sure that formatting is similar to the education to the projects and to the work experience um yeah yeah so somebody asked where can i have my resume for review guys if you want to submit your resume for review here's what we can do you guys ready ready you're gonna ask me your resume for review oh sh are we gonna open the floodgates just a little bit just for a little bit my god guys this is your reward you're gonna get the chance for the lottery of all these 80 resumes where we're only doing like three a week or so who knows how many we're doing but you get the chance so if you keep showing up consistently and you smash that thumbs up and leave some positive the air table so positivity and love in the comments submit go ahead and go to the air table that nas just dropped point right there let's go let me hype up the crowd because everyone's getting quiet on us let's go let's add a little rocket in there boom yo uh let's uh i don't know if uh ash cat is still on but you want to do his best yeah let's go let's go ash ashkat where's god i'll probably miss pronounce it um i sent you his name on the slack i see oh 83 e3 okay there we go all right let's take a look at this one action well i mispronounce it is action okay okay okay and you see he was smart enough he was smart oh oh no come on akshat come on come on bro oh hold on how are you gonna do this to nas bro how are you gonna do that tonight how do i i don't have assassins are you playing are you playing that sad music music oh man nas is speechless right now akshay we were literally four for four with one page resumes today or three for three i don't even know we're crushing it man what happened one page guys so let's take a look at it really quickly here this might be our last resume guys this might be our last resume so let's go ahead and check this one out okay really quickly so here's what i want to do here's what i want to do are you ready are you ready by the way how much do we i'm just really trying to figure out so we have oh guys if you're submitting a resume please redact your information how access did here yeah so you see how i did it which is really smart so that's how that's how did which is really crazy because we're not going to do that for you since uh we got no time for that we ain't got no time for that simple as that already giving you a lot of value let's go so okay pros and cons what do you think are the pros the pros again i see good sections which makes it easy to read okay so yeah i would say the prosperous is easy to read i would i i would agree with that yes so easy easy easy easy to read to read okay okay what's another one what's another pro another pro right off the bat my i mean i think it's cool that he's highlighting well actually that's not right that one's not a pro um the work experience is a pro that it's very close to being a software developer i mean it is literally being a software developer so it's cool that he's able to highlight that and it looks like he goes deep into the details but we'll go in and dissect that in a bit so yeah so work experience is nicely highlighted which i love that portion i love that portion okay okay let's not now let's talk about the cons or the cons okay okay um the projects dude like what the actual man yeah like this an instagram clone yeah you built a whatsapp clone and you created fun projects dot i n yeah and all you're like dude give me some context these are like some juicy projects that i want to know about what's going on brother this right here is your money you're on the money right here bro this is your money it's the money it's the money it's the money bro so look what i want you to do is i want you you to expand on projects i want you to not only say i want you to expand on the project just how you did here you see this right here math works i want you to do in the exactly the same way and it is exactly the same way so for example you can say right you can say insta so for example because the instagram clone right and underneath that you could say for example so created created or developed developed and you know an insta instagram instagram clone using your xjs using react.js react gs for learning purposes boom right there see so i want you to go down as deep as this and then for example you can say technology is used right so i'm not sure technologies you use here challenge is used and so i want you to expand on that okay i want to expand your projects is your value and then put down your github so then you say for example github okay and then you then then you say github then you say also you can say for example your link or your your uh your live link right and the other thing i would add to this so guys i'm a huge proponent of if you go through these clones don't just do the clones give yourself nice challenges of features that you can add to the clones because that's where you're really going to learn a lot so if you do add those features those could be the extra tabs right along with those things talk about what you did in that process because i mean if i'm being honest just because you followed a tutorial doesn't really like you get to see some behind the scenes but that's not really your project now someone else's project that you're able to follow so you actually get that experience and you get that ownership when you build out a specific feature that you thought about for example the amazon clone i'm not too familiar with all the features but imagine you built one where you get to see all of your order history yeah right i don't know the amazon already had that no no no no no no okay perfect so you build out that feature so you need a back end where you have to put the orders every time someone does a fake purchase or whatever and keep all the order history and it shows it nice now you can talk about that and be like fully integrated you know fully integrated a back end to this application using whatever firebase whatever database you use yeah yeah i would agree with that 100 agree with that man 100 good that guy so yeah add extra features to your projects okay next up let's go ahead and take a look at so your another thing that i would say remove this right here so your high school is not necessarily needed anymore just talk about your indian institute of information technology that is all you need your high school nobody cares about i do want to say this not because i've noticed this from the previous ones is they said that in india they care a lot about the academics okay so i think i think there's a caveat there i think if it's for uh work in india that might be different but if it's a work united states you don't need your high school your college should be enough for united states probably not necessarily exactly so finances part i like your for example now i do like your website here i do like your github here i do like your linkedin that is great um but though what i would say is when actually it's printed out a lot of the times like it's not actually going to be you know you can actually add proper links so add proper links on here you know what i mean so add proper links because when you print it out it's not going to be a link right do you go with me on that one yeah yeah yeah like if you want to go to the github it'd be like github.com or whatever that ends up looking like yes i agree and it's like they they can't just like press on this paper okay and it takes next up your next up your interest promote that please okay your interest no i don't care for your interest bro i'm sorry i'm sorry i just don't i care about what you've done and you're saying and what they've said exactly what not said before and they're saying in the comments for your interest that's things that you could talk about in the interview if they come up yes you can talk about that in the interview exactly but they are going to initially look at specifically what and hobbies ah you don't need that as well like pull you know pull cooker and you know i'm not sure what that means but cook pull cooker um so again all this you can remove all this stuff you can remove and that way you can actually go and make it one page okay so remove that stuff you don't really need that i'm sorry you just really don't okay let's continue on so i want to achievements oh you're a tedx speaker no way oh bro we got greatness among us wow that's insane let's go shout out yo that is insane we got greatness in the house yes so i'm not sure what you touched on but i think that is amazing so the fact that give a tedx talk honestly keep that keep the achievements as a tedx speaker that is amazing recognition at ie it um not sure kanapur my dashboard was featured on the home page okay you can talk about that as well but what i would say for example is to move this up right so you can probably remove some spacing to make sure that these are up okay vice chair and best delegate awards and multiple model united nations conferences damn holy damn bro damn that's the cp community for you brother that's insane so i love that looks like you've got some amazing projects you've got some amazing experience okay on you pretty much what you're missing a shot is you're missing number one the project so you make sure you basically expand on those projects that's pretty much all you're missing and then let's go and take a look at your now um you know let your your work experience okay let's take a look workspace so it looks like mathworks bangalore c plus plus software developer i like that so it's pretty clear it looks like you're from february to present that's pretty easy to read as well um oil enhancement so own and enhanced meth works infrastructure messaging to support async workflows with return values so i love that the word enhanced right there enhanced okay enhanced so here's i would say out enhanced enhanced so you know you know we've been going at it for a while when we just started laughing at these words dude i'm hunched okay okay so great so here's what i want you to do here literally is this own and enhanced i don't know i'm not sure what owned the means but when you own something what i would say is this right here enhancement nobody really cares about just specifically say enhanced math works infrastructure or messaging to support async workflows with return values and you don't need to have all this other stuff honestly okay okay you do not need to have all this other stuff the bug facing as well nobody cares about this stuff this bug fixing right we don't need that and in terms of data major architecture given yeah in terms of in terms of creating a major um major rearchitecture of glim i think there's something there so here's what you can say here here you can say things like and let me tell you here here you can see things like you know increased developer efficiency developer efficiency buy by re architecting glim our internal internal tool really i'm not sure where glenn is but you get my point you get my point okay and so this and that's it so we talked about just it this glim you know talking about what glim is you can talk about that on the actual you can talk about on the actual interview so they might ask you here what what is glim right what is glim and so you get the chance hey glim is this this this is this what it does and this is what we worked on right and this is why it's so important so that's what i would say is is have room to talk about something you see what i mean yeah so either someone who's familiar with math work products is gonna be like oh i've seen glimpse yeah i know what that is they can ask you detailed questions or someone who's not they might be like oh interesting oh my bad oh interesting what is this glimpting and then you just like oh cool it's this cool you know interthreading yeah messaging structure yeah used under the hood of the entire line of math works products exactly oh my god that's dope exactly so so somebody said the gist is use less verbage to highlight your experience it's as simple as that yeah use less rubbish to highlight your experience that's it guys okay next up we have let me see so that's what i would do for that specific work experience let's continue on to the next one 70 said can you please also do a live stream on how to land internship and resume critique for okay how to land an internship at google that could be a good we're live what do you think yeah for sure that could be a good live video so next up math what is this matt engineered edg um i'm not sure what this specifically means um is this you are um kind of engineer i'm not sure if you're trying to apply for develop development position you don't really need this i would say like depends on what position you're applying for you might not even need this otherwise what i would say is combine these two together i don't want to see know the same company as being two different things i want to see one thing okay and then anything that's related to that put it underneath that okay what i just read a rose's junior comment asked can you review my resume but it is in dutch oh god i'm sorry i can't rose i don't know dutch so i don't i don't know how much help i would be there yeah uh akshat says it's there were two different posts like i said i would say somehow either combine and combine them or if you do not need this engineering at edg i would say remove that i'll remove that okay next up because your internship right here is actually pretty interesting right here so it looks like resenders looks like you center for cyber security it blah blah summer research intern i think that's pretty interesting so for example let's take a look at this stuff so you've got some you've got done some great stuff honestly you're pretty much on your way to really having you know honestly you're on your way to um you know oh perfect look at this look at this check this out create a thread intelligence jingle recipe to aggregate the intel for multiple online sources so here you can say for example aggregated intel from multiple online sources online sources right by creating a threat intelligence oh damn that's crazy intelligent yeah this this is like this is a great sentence that you already have but just bring the results first that extra little spice okay i'm i integrated intel from multiple line sources beautiful that's it okay next up let's say if you look at for example create malicious url detection system using machine learning yes great i love how you did that but tell me what did that do so for example you can say that this specifically by creating a url malicious detection system you can for example how what can you say what can you say protected company company computers by creating i'm not sure what what specifically happened by creating malicious malicious url detection systems what do you think about that one protected company computers result by creating malicious url detection systems action perfect follow the guidelines that's it create a lifetime intelligence dashboard a lot to the analyze next yeah also look analyze and tracked realtime cyber threats prevailing role uh so here here i would say analyzed what actually here i'll have you do this one what do you think about about this uh all right let me get off the youtube comment section then you always need me dude i'm crushing these comments bro the people are loving me yo guys if you're loving my comments give me a little thumbs up so nasa believes me give give a thumbs down guys which one do you want me to look at i don't know you're telling me dude i don't know where you left off bro [Laughter] right here right here uh bro you're moving your mouse everywhere create a live thread intelligence dash right here that's the one using elk stack to analyze and track realtime cyber threats prevailing worldwide gotcha so the result was if this is just a specific project yeah it would be the analyze and track yep yep i'm trying to see if there's a better way to do it but i think that's just gonna be it no well um yeah so analyzing i guess yeah then hey there we go here he put it right there look at that i know i wasn't tracked oh he broke dude this guy's learning more this guy's faster than you bro you got to step up your game bro i know man i'm just here wasting my time on this live apparently yo i got a thumbs up from peter let's go let's go peter my only fan at the moment screw you guys oh you're giving a bunch of value and only peter gives me a thumbs up so guys i love this one so this is honestly a really good resume i will be honest and and with a few fixes you can really make this an amazing resume okay just how we talked about the projects right at those projects we talked about use results driven you know action words make it one page please make it one page everything else is pretty much nice you've got your skills you've got your libraries that you that you you know right and i think and i feel like a lot of people i'm not sure if they're copying or they've they've seen our other you know videos but they're doing it in a similar way you see that

internship if you just build a project you build a technical skill set and the projects are something that you could show people you're gonna grab eyeballs you're gonna grab attention whether it's an
