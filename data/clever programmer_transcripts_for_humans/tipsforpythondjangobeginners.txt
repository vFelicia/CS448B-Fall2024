With timestamps:

00:00 - what type of advice would you give to
00:02 - calm science major trying to get in the
00:04 - trying to get work in industry I would
00:07 - look aggressively for work apply between
00:10 - 3,200 places a day and don't just rely
00:13 - on your degree to do all of the work for
00:16 - you how much time did it take me to
00:18 - become a programmer about 3 to 6 months
00:23 - until I started getting work so I like
00:27 - to use that as a metric for how long it
00:29 - took me because once you start earning
00:30 - and compliment your programmer I was
00:34 - also coding between 12 to 16 hours a day
00:39 - so then it helped me become a developer
00:42 - and get those skills a lot faster that's
00:45 - what I would recommend for you tips for
00:47 - Python and Django beginners so the tips
00:50 - I would give you are master the
00:52 - fundamentals with Python learn the
00:54 - basics really get your basics down be
00:57 - able to solve lots of coding problems
00:59 - maybe even take them around with hacker
01:01 - rank or code Wars and those not the
01:05 - project Euler be able to solve problems
01:07 - be able to do simple projects with just
01:09 - purely Python so say you want to do
01:11 - tic-tac-toe or you want to do
01:13 - rock-paper-scissors simple projects be
01:16 - able to do them with Python then once
01:18 - you do that then jump into the tier of
01:20 - web development which is going to be
01:22 - Jango so then start messing around with
01:25 - Jango and create projects with Jango
01:27 - okay
01:28 - increase the layer of complexity one
01:31 - step at a time don't introduce too many
01:33 - things at once if you're a complete
01:35 - beginner to web development don't jump
01:37 - into web development right away with
01:39 - Django start with flask class cast less
01:42 - magic flask is a lot simpler once you
01:45 - get the hang of web development build a
01:46 - few simple projects of glass then move
01:49 - over to Django because it's a framework
01:52 - for perfectionist with deadlines and it
01:54 - allows you to build things really really
01:55 - quick keeps you super productive but it
01:58 - has a little bit more magic than class
02:00 - which means it's a little bit more
02:02 - complex inherently dense last so that's
02:05 - why you want to start with flask first
02:06 - understand web development and how
02:08 - routes work and how URLs work and how
02:11 - views work things like that though MVC
02:14 - you know the Model View controller type
02:15 - of mechanism works then switch over to
02:17 - Django and it'll be a smooth transition
02:19 - and you're gonna be a great great
02:21 - developer so that is the tip for a
02:23 - Python slash a Django a beginner how can
02:28 - one know if he's a developer if he
02:29 - creates something and gets paid for it
02:31 - if he works if he or she works for a
02:33 - company or a freelancing client you're
02:35 - not getting paid for it you're a fake if
02:38 - you're getting paid for something then
02:39 - your profession
02:42 - Python cuz the snake is cool easiest
02:45 - programming languages are popular than
02:46 - Kim Kardashian Google is built off
02:49 - Python Instagram is built off Python
02:51 - nASA uses Python Spotify uses Python so
02:55 - it's very simple to start and you can go
02:57 - as complex as you want that's why Python
02:59 - for making how did you advertise
03:01 - yourself in the beginning to get clients
03:02 - Craigslist why is that take lessons
03:05 - those were my main platforms I got me a
03:06 - lot of clients fill stuff so I just
03:08 - learnt scraping and how to get to store
03:09 - data into files or a database just
03:11 - trying to apply for a lot of jobs right
03:14 - now five cent a day fill try to get to
03:16 - twenty to a hundred a day but good job
03:19 - with five to ten a day and storing files
03:23 - and stuff learn how databases work to
03:25 - learn sequel and learn Postgres and
03:28 - writing stuff to a post whereas database
03:30 - that's going to be your key to winning
03:32 - so you want to understand sequel and
03:34 - databases with Python and then you will
03:37 - win best source for learning web
03:38 - scraping go to my youtube go to youtube
03:41 - clever programmer type in web scraping
03:45 - yep ssam court you can be a data
03:47 - scientist and work remotely but data
03:49 - scientists becoming a data scientist is
03:50 - very difficult so I like to generally
03:54 - break I would like to recommend people
03:56 - break in through doing web development
03:57 - first then break into data science books
03:59 - or web development I personally never
04:01 - went through any books on web
04:02 - development I just did a lot of stuff
04:03 - through YouTube my own learning and
04:06 - Udacity do you need a good university
04:10 - for web development you do not need a
04:12 - good you do not need a good degree from
04:14 - a good university for web development
04:16 - you just need good skills a piece of
04:18 - paper that's really expensive isn't
04:20 - gonna get you anywhere
04:21 - work on developing the skills be
04:22 - self-taught always be learning the
04:24 - newest thing develop the skill of
04:26 - learning new things really fast
04:28 - and apply to lots of places really
04:31 - aggressively you will do really well
04:32 - what do I do now it is full-time Kluber
04:34 - programmer and build a business how do
04:36 - you learn API YouTube is going to be
04:39 - your best friend my friend look up api's
04:41 - look up Python learn API is there
04:43 - complex concept if you don't know it but
04:45 - once you get it it's really really
04:47 - simple it's beautiful so again I'm going
04:49 - to answer this question again how did I
04:50 - get my first clients Craigslist why dad
04:53 - to take us the best resources for Jengo
04:55 - YouTube YouTube YouTube and clothing for
04:58 - entrepreneurs he was one of my favorite
05:00 - resources for Jango look up on YouTube
05:03 - okay guys that's it thank you so much
05:06 - for watching
05:14 - thank you I love you guys I love your
05:16 - face this is Kazi i'll see you in the
05:17 - next livestream
