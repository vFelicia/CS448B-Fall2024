00:00 - hey guys welcome back to the learn
00:02 - command line tutorial so what if we want
00:07 - to remove a
00:09 - file that's where I I told you guys
00:12 - we're going to pick back up so let's
00:14 - jump into that so remember how we C
00:16 - created playground we're going to remove
00:18 - that from here and then I will have you
00:21 - go and practice that so removing is a
00:25 - very simple command it's just
00:28 - RM okay
00:31 - RM that's it followed by it takes in an
00:34 - argument so you pass it what you want it
00:37 - to delete so we can say
00:40 - RM playground okay and it says RM
00:45 - playground is a directory so you can't
00:47 - necessarily remove directories in one go
00:50 - I'll teach you a trick for that as well
00:54 - that it's a little bit more advanced but
00:56 - you need to pass it a switch dasr for
00:59 - now just do it without kind of really
01:01 - thinking about it but later on I'll show
01:04 - you guys uh how it actually works okay
01:09 - so I did rm- R playground it goes
01:12 - examine files in directory I said yes
01:14 - and then it goes remove playground I
01:16 - said yes y means yes and it essentially
01:19 - removed it it's not there anymore notice
01:21 - playground is gone how cool is that I
01:24 - didn't do anything it was just magic I
01:26 - didn't have to touch the goey it just
01:28 - took care took care of it for me well
01:32 - now let's bring playground back so I'm
01:35 - going to do mkdir
01:39 - playground and we should have it back
01:41 - and in playground let's just add a file
01:45 - all right let's add a new file
01:51 - so um what would be the fastest way to
01:55 - add a file
01:58 - here
02:06 - playground new
02:15 - file okay kind of don't worry about how
02:17 - I did that so much
02:20 - because whoops don't need that
02:25 - one don't need that one I just needed to
02:28 - create this file here that says some
02:30 - example whatever uh we don't care what
02:33 - it actually is we just care it's a file
02:35 - it could have been a movie it could have
02:37 - been uh a picture a JPEG file a PNG file
02:43 - mov file it really doesn't matter I just
02:45 - needed to create a file uh I have again
02:48 - I have some other shortcut set up for my
02:50 - Sublime Text to open and I essentially
02:52 - am saying open Sublime Text or St here
02:56 - in the current directory which is the
02:57 - one period I explained to you guys in
02:59 - the last video two periods as Parent
03:01 - Directory so a previous directory but
03:03 - what I want to show you after creating
03:05 - this file is how to remove the file well
03:07 - that's is just simple as RM
03:10 - example um oh I'm sorry I have to So
03:13 - currently I'm in documents I need to go
03:15 - into playground so once I'm in
03:17 - playground and I hit LS I'll see
03:19 - example.py which is right here
03:22 - example.py and I'm going to do RM
03:25 - playground or sorry example and when I
03:28 - hit tab remember to hit Tab and
03:30 - autocomplete and I'm going to hit enter
03:32 - let's see what happens it goes remove
03:34 - example.py I'm going to say yes and it
03:37 - removed
03:38 - it and be careful be very careful when
03:42 - you're using these remove commands
03:44 - because if you remove something it's
03:47 - gone
03:48 - forever it's not going to go into your
03:50 - recycling bin where it's going to stay
03:52 - for 30 days and let you delete it and
03:54 - clean it up out of there or retrieve it
03:56 - later it's just wiped off of your your
03:59 - hard drive right away so when you are
04:02 - using RM these commands just make sure
04:06 - that you know what you're doing when
04:08 - you're running these commands now when
04:09 - you do RM it might not ask you like are
04:13 - you sure you want to delete I have set
04:14 - it to that so I can't delete anything by
04:17 - mistake uh but regardless just be
04:20 - careful when you're running this command
04:22 - okay that's how you remove files and
04:24 - that's how you remove folders that's it
04:26 - for this video I'll show you perhaps in
04:28 - the next video how we can rename files
04:30 - and folders okay I'll see you there

hey guys welcome back to the learn command line tutorial so what if we want to remove a file that's where I I told you guys we're going to pick back up so let's jump into that so remember how we C created playground we're going to remove that from here and then I will have you go and practice that so removing is a very simple command it's just RM okay RM that's it followed by it takes in an argument so you pass it what you want it to delete so we can say RM playground okay and it says RM playground is a directory so you can't necessarily remove directories in one go I'll teach you a trick for that as well that it's a little bit more advanced but you need to pass it a switch dasr for now just do it without kind of really thinking about it but later on I'll show you guys uh how it actually works okay so I did rm R playground it goes examine files in directory I said yes and then it goes remove playground I said yes y means yes and it essentially removed it it's not there anymore notice playground is gone how cool is that I didn't do anything it was just magic I didn't have to touch the goey it just took care took care of it for me well now let's bring playground back so I'm going to do mkdir playground and we should have it back and in playground let's just add a file all right let's add a new file so um what would be the fastest way to add a file here playground new file okay kind of don't worry about how I did that so much because whoops don't need that one don't need that one I just needed to create this file here that says some example whatever uh we don't care what it actually is we just care it's a file it could have been a movie it could have been uh a picture a JPEG file a PNG file mov file it really doesn't matter I just needed to create a file uh I have again I have some other shortcut set up for my Sublime Text to open and I essentially am saying open Sublime Text or St here in the current directory which is the one period I explained to you guys in the last video two periods as Parent Directory so a previous directory but what I want to show you after creating this file is how to remove the file well that's is just simple as RM example um oh I'm sorry I have to So currently I'm in documents I need to go into playground so once I'm in playground and I hit LS I'll see example.py which is right here example.py and I'm going to do RM playground or sorry example and when I hit tab remember to hit Tab and autocomplete and I'm going to hit enter let's see what happens it goes remove example.py I'm going to say yes and it removed it and be careful be very careful when you're using these remove commands because if you remove something it's gone forever it's not going to go into your recycling bin where it's going to stay for 30 days and let you delete it and clean it up out of there or retrieve it later it's just wiped off of your your hard drive right away so when you are using RM these commands just make sure that you know what you're doing when you're running these commands now when you do RM it might not ask you like are you sure you want to delete I have set it to that so I can't delete anything by mistake uh but regardless just be careful when you're running this command okay that's how you remove files and that's how you remove folders that's it for this video I'll show you perhaps in the next video how we can rename files and folders okay I'll see you there
