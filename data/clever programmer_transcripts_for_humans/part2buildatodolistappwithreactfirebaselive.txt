With timestamps:

00:00 - five dollars total or if the job is
00:02 - gonna pay you $500 total it's gonna be
00:04 - matched to your level because once
00:05 - you're a beginner when you're a beginner
00:06 - you want to land a small jobs and then
00:08 - we'll show you how to land jobs that are
00:10 - more so you know we have one of our
00:12 - clients who last month did twenty eight
00:15 - thousand dollars in one month
00:17 - freelancing and already this month he's
00:19 - closed over twelve thousand dollars and
00:21 - so you have some students who are much
00:24 - more advanced or a beginner so it really
00:26 - doesn't matter where ever you are will
00:28 - match and we'll show you how to actually
00:30 - make an income with these skills cause
00:33 - yeah I think somebody said something's
00:36 - happened to the link maybe the link is
00:40 - not everything can we test the link no
00:42 - as in the live stream is a live stream
00:44 - active guys because some people have
00:45 - said what happened it ended is that a
00:48 - video stopped so maybe I think the
00:51 - videos come down no we live concurrent
00:56 - via stream finished oh I think was it
00:59 - three hours maybe
01:00 - damn it seems like but but how come if
01:06 - the electricity went out oh I just
01:09 - disconnected from your session you are a
01:11 - live stream session on your your vs live
01:14 - share because my internet went out
01:17 - probably for a little bit right yeah
01:19 - okay yeah interesting hold on
01:26 - yeah it says zero live yeah oh we're
01:30 - back 107 108 we're back okay 110 yeah I
01:34 - don't know how this works but the
01:35 - network stuff of YouTube and everything
01:37 - is pretty awesome sick so we're back
01:39 - yeah right
01:41 - awesome guys yeah really apologize about
01:43 - that I don't know why the stream ended
01:46 - let me just hit dismiss on here and see
01:48 - what happens hopefully is it back on
01:51 - YouTube Frankie if you got I think so
01:57 - okay so so basically guys so that's one
02:01 - huge part but the other huge part is the
02:03 - fact that you guys get weekly JavaScript
02:05 - and react training calls on every single
02:08 - one of your calls every single week
02:11 - you're gonna get those calls so sunny
02:13 - how
02:13 - they get calls with you and Nas right
02:16 - yes so you have coaching calls with me
02:19 - with Naz with Jacob pretty much what
02:23 - happens is in those coaching calls like
02:25 - well I tend to do in my coaching calls
02:27 - is go through real build so just like
02:29 - what we did today we would usually start
02:32 - the coaching call off with some
02:33 - high-level information how you can
02:35 - actually earn money with JavaScript so
02:37 - like I usually go through three
02:38 - different ways about how you can teach
02:40 - it about how you can start making an
02:42 - income from cheering how you can land
02:45 - your first freelancing client and then
02:46 - we kind of go into a build where you
02:49 - guys will build alongside me if you get
02:51 - stuck you can plug those questions it's
02:53 - a really cool interactive process yep
02:56 - and just to give you guys a sense of our
02:59 - community so check it out we have about
03:01 - 1200 members in our JavaScript community
03:05 - and if I go here these are all of our
03:10 - members so the list just keeps going on
03:13 - with how many members we have and
03:15 - they're all really really amazing people
03:18 - that are part of this program it's
03:20 - really like a family and so everybody
03:22 - really here supports each other
03:24 - everybody uplifts each other we're all
03:26 - in this journey together you know some
03:28 - of them are like hey I just quit uber
03:30 - and now I am doing this so I want to
03:32 - make an income and some people are like
03:35 - I've been coding and I'm an engineer but
03:37 - I really want to take it to the next
03:39 - level and learn how to make six figures
03:41 - as a developer and more and so when you
03:44 - join this you're really getting a whole
03:46 - family you know with you and for example
03:49 - here is you know Naz who's one of your
03:52 - is gonna be one of your main instructors
03:53 - in the program right he's doing these
03:57 - calls and he even assigned homework for
04:00 - everybody and so everybody's now gonna
04:02 - go and finish that homework assignment
04:04 - and then go look for work after that
04:07 - exactly yep
04:09 - so those are some important highlights I
04:12 - wanted to show you guys if you guys want
04:14 - to jump in just go here whichever plan
04:16 - you want to choose monthly or yearly up
04:19 - to you in the yearly one you'll save
04:21 - some in save three hundred dollars but
04:23 - at this point if you got in value guys
04:25 - go ahead click that link
04:27 - in the description click the bun which
04:30 - says join now jump in the program I mean
04:32 - your JavaScript career and your career
04:34 - as a reactive L appear just gonna
04:36 - skyrocket to another level
04:38 - so if you are since I'm here and you
04:40 - want to learn you would just do yourself
04:42 - a huge disservice not taking advantage
04:45 - of this opportunity right now because
04:47 - the price does go up tonight yep and for
04:54 - sixty seven dollars a month is and
04:55 - absolutely still for what you're getting
04:57 - is insane most people say is what a 10k
05:00 - coding boot camp just from the live
05:01 - coaching calls so it really does like
05:04 - blow people's minds that we offer it for
05:06 - so cheap literally like Jose literally
05:10 - said this exact same thing so yeah he's
05:13 - like this course has given me way more
05:15 - value than my six months coding boot
05:16 - camp that I paid $10,000 for and so this
05:19 - is something we get very very commonly
05:21 - people who have taken coding boot camps
05:22 - in many different places full-stack
05:24 - Academy they have gone to like galvanize
05:28 - bunch of their boot camps and then
05:29 - they're like hey I got more value out of
05:31 - this program than anything else and so
05:33 - this program our goal is to get it to be
05:36 - a really expensive program but because
05:39 - of everything that's happening right now
05:40 - in the world and you know also it's 4th
05:44 - of July so we wanted to make it as
05:45 - affordable for you as possible so you
05:47 - don't have that barrier to entry so you
05:52 - know again this is the time that you
05:55 - should learn coding because coding and
05:57 - JavaScript and all these jobs are at
06:00 - their peak right now because everybody's
06:02 - trying to work from home so if you learn
06:04 - these skills right now you will have a
06:07 - career and you will have really
06:10 - successful results compared a lot of
06:11 - other people who are out of their jobs
06:13 - and don't know what to do exactly
06:17 - perfectly per yeah and guys you can work
06:21 - anywhere in the world so it really
06:22 - doesn't matter where you are in the
06:24 - world like if you're somewhere
