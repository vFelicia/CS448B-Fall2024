00:58 - high school chess team I am their coach
01:02 - and so I'm helping them out here and
01:05 - it's kind of we're just having a good
01:07 - time really so I just decided to go on

01:16 - wanted to just talk with you guys for a
01:17 - little bit before we decide to actually
01:22 - you know I'm skipping dinner for this so

01:37 - I'm here to do um just to tell you guys
01:40 - a little bit about what's kind of going
01:42 - on it's a high school championship the
01:45 - high school is now North High Evek
01:48 - awesome obviously they're doing great
01:51 - thank you harsh kamar says nice Thank
01:54 - You Ches Phillip yes Carter hi Carter
01:57 - lamps up so we are going to be playing
02:03 - in the state championship and today is
02:05 - like the rest day today we just got here
02:07 - we got our hotels this is my room and
02:10 - one of my friends is probably going to
02:11 - be coming here
02:13 - and what I did is I decided to bring
02:14 - some PI H ap gaming I decided bring some
02:17 - equipment with me so maybe you know I
02:19 - wanted to do something recording or
02:20 - shooting so you can see that I brought
02:22 - brought some stuff you know like a
02:24 - little bit tripod or whatever and right
02:26 - now I'm actually just recording with my
02:28 - phone so it's kind of crazy YouTube came
02:32 - up with this new feature where you can
02:33 - actually just go live with your phone so
02:35 - that's effectively what I am doing but I
02:40 - am working on some I have a few videos
02:43 - for you guys already that I I put
02:45 - together but didn't get time to push
02:47 - them out to you guys so I'm sorry about
02:49 - that I apologize other than that I am
02:54 - recording a little bit of playing chest
02:57 - live so playing really fast games where
02:59 - I have like 30 seconds or 10 seconds and
03:02 - then who I'm playing with they'll have
03:04 - like 2 minutes or 5 minutes and then
03:05 - I've kind of recorded it so everybody
03:07 - who's following me a snapchat got to see
03:09 - a lot of that so I would say if you have
03:14 - snapchat add me it's Roffe a 1 RAF eh 1
03:20 - and yeah you kind of get a peek at
03:25 - what's going on behind the scenes and if
03:27 - you have any questions you know I
03:29 - usually will personally reply back to
03:33 - you or even if you're following along
03:36 - with the story that's going on I will
03:38 - usually answer lots of questions if you
03:42 - guys have any questions right now about
03:44 - coding or programming go ahead and start
03:46 - typing them in or if you guys have
03:49 - questions general questions
03:51 - RAF eh one so maybe I can write it here
03:56 - no um
03:58 - can i right here with you guys no
04:03 - unfortunately it looks like I can't
04:05 - write so it's are a fh1 so yeah add me
04:11 - there but anyways if you have any
04:14 - general questions about life if you have
04:17 - questions about which college you should
04:21 - go to or what can you do with program
04:25 - or what programming language you should
04:28 - start off with or is it too late for you
04:31 - to start programming you know any kind
04:33 - of questions you have I would be happy
04:35 - more than happy to answer them for you
04:39 - and you know in the longer run we will
04:43 - be doing live coding sessions to where
04:45 - we'll actually build something together
04:47 - this was just kind of for fun I thought
04:50 - that I didn't get a chance to see you
04:52 - guys today so I decided to kind of just
04:55 - do this so if you guys have questions
04:58 - start putting them in little thing in
05:00 - the little box oh and I did a live
05:04 - webinar with all the students wretchedly
05:06 - enrolled in the learn Python course well
05:10 - okay one second they said that I should
05:12 - install mantra pack one what program in
05:14 - or should I have start okay harsh Kumar
05:17 - I'm gonna ask you a question so that's a
05:19 - great question he says what programming
05:22 - language should I start with now I have
05:24 - a video that answers that it's called
05:26 - what programming language that I learned
05:28 - first and if you look it up it ranks
05:30 - first so haha engineer truth no I'm just
05:32 - kidding I love you engineer truth okay
05:37 - I'll kind of answer that question right
05:39 - here as well you want to start with
05:43 - something simple okay if it's in real
05:46 - life if it's an ink you know you're
05:48 - trying to pick up a language you don't
05:49 - want to start off with a really
05:51 - complicated language even if you're
05:52 - trying to speak to another human being
05:54 - imagine if you're trying to teach a
05:55 - language to somebody who's never spoken
05:57 - before you'll try to teach them some
05:59 - kind of easy language something that's
06:02 - not super difficult so I would I would
06:06 - ask you to reframe your way of thinking
06:07 - and and do that with basically think
06:12 - about that about programming like that
06:13 - okay so you should pick the programming
06:16 - language which is a way to talk to a
06:18 - computer exactly the way you would about
06:23 - go and go about that in a human language
06:25 - so pick something simple I mean some of
06:28 - the simplest stuff you can start off
06:30 - with a scratch actually which is built
06:32 - by MIT which is built to visually use
06:36 - blocks of code
06:38 - and many things happen now that's a
06:40 - really good place to start off with but
06:42 - the reason why I don't personally
06:44 - recommend that as a first language to
06:46 - start off with is because while it's
06:49 - good to build your fundamentals that
06:51 - gives you strong fundamentals you can't
06:54 - really develop real apps and real things
06:56 - with it
06:56 - so I recommend a language that's fairly
06:59 - easy but also very powerful which is
07:03 - Python so you know like I always say
07:06 - like Instagram is built off of it and
07:08 - then one alt likes majority of Google is
07:11 - actually written in Python so it's a
07:14 - very powerful language but it's also
07:16 - very simple its syntax is very simple
07:18 - you don't have to worry about all this
07:19 - squiggly and all that stuff and then
07:22 - when you're using libraries which is
07:24 - like stealing code it's super easy and
07:27 - by stealing me the code I mean actually
07:29 - ethically stealing code I you know using
07:31 - somebody's libraries or open-source
07:33 - framework and then building on top of
07:35 - that it's as easy as just saying import
07:37 - blah blah blah and then that's it you're
07:39 - done
07:40 - which in for example if you're working
07:43 - with C you might have to get to the
07:44 - binary level and go to C make and really
07:47 - install everything from scratch you know
07:49 - for those of you guys who were doing
07:51 - video like recognition you know data
07:55 - analytics or whatever some some
07:57 - intensive stuff in computer science and
07:59 - programming try to make OpenCV work
08:03 - would see its hell it's a lot of work
08:06 - but now try to make it work with Python
08:08 - and if you get the anaconda manager I
08:11 - mean it's like at one line and it just
08:13 - installs everything for you so you know
08:18 - if somebody doesn't know any language
08:20 - for me to go in a lot of depth wouldn't
08:23 - really make that much sense for you but
08:25 - I will just say that it's a very easy
08:29 - language to start off with and it's the
08:31 - benefits of how easy it is really keep
08:36 - showing as you progress to more advanced
08:38 - stuff in Python you'll start to see how
08:40 - you can do really big things really
08:43 - quickly so even with a few lines of code
08:45 - you can actually do video detection and
08:49 - image recognition and thing
08:50 - like that and in our course with the
08:54 - kind of things that we're working on is
08:55 - essentially building GUI applications
08:57 - which is called graphical user interface
09:00 - so instead of just writing code that
09:03 - runs in your command line or terminal I
09:05 - mean that's really cool because you know
09:07 - we're all nerds that's awesome for us we
09:09 - run it and we don't care it's awesome
09:10 - but if you're trying to show your
09:12 - girlfriend if you're trying to show your
09:13 - boyfriend or whoever right your friends
09:15 - they're gonna be like yeah you know it's
09:18 - they're not gonna get it if they have to
09:20 - use a command line to run your code
09:21 - they're gonna be like what the heck is
09:22 - this so if you build a graphical user
09:26 - interface were there clicking buttons
09:29 - and graphical things are showing up and
09:30 - blah blah on the back Python code is
09:33 - running but they don't really they don't
09:34 - need to know that they just work on the
09:36 - graphical part of it then it's fun for
09:40 - them and they want to use your app and
09:41 - they also want to you know then learn
09:44 - how they can code themselves as well so
09:47 - that's the things that we're focusing on
09:50 - in our Python courses like really
09:52 - building apps and those of you guys who
09:54 - are either new or have been watching my
09:58 - channel but haven't really or don't
10:00 - really know that I make coding tutorials
10:02 - because I do a lot of life advice type
10:04 - of stuff but yeah there's a ton of
10:06 - tutorials or son of content you can
10:08 - start off with Python I think it's a
10:10 - great language for you to actually start
10:12 - off with but let's say that your goal is
10:15 - completely different and you want to do
10:16 - something like web development and just
10:19 - completely front-end stuff then
10:21 - JavaScript and HTML those are good
10:23 - language to start off with but what I
10:26 - would say is you can still combine that
10:27 - with Python so on the back end like all
10:30 - the heavy lifting you can use Python
10:32 - with and on the front end to make things
10:34 - look beautiful you could use JavaScript
10:37 - HTML things of that nature okay awesome
10:40 - good questions is there anybody else who
10:42 - has a question I'll jump on it right now
10:44 - and answer it for you
10:45 - if you have a question and drop it right
10:48 - in there I'm gonna wait for you I am
10:53 - waiting for you
10:58 - cool let's see the room it's alright
11:05 - it's alright
11:08 - okay no questions you guys suck you guys
11:11 - don't got any questions so you know I'm
11:17 - just gonna go ahead and talk a little
11:19 - bit feel free to watch you know soft
11:23 - skills the reason why I talk about them
11:25 - so much and I emphasize them so much is
11:27 - because let's be honest they are the
11:31 - things that will get you to work with
11:33 - other people that will get other people
11:36 - to like you and work with you because as
11:40 - humans were very emotional creatures so
11:43 - people who want to like for example
11:44 - right you can train somebody how to make
11:47 - a sandwich but you can't train them how
11:49 - to be happy right so if you have a
11:51 - really unhappy employee I mean and then
11:56 - know how to make a sandwich like big
11:58 - deal you can hire somebody else who's
12:00 - happy who doesn't know how to make a
12:01 - sandwich and then you can teach them how
12:03 - to make a sandwich but you can't teach
12:05 - that unhappy person to be happy right so
12:08 - door certain traits can't be taught
12:11 - technical skills you can pick up a book
12:13 - or whatever and you can actually just
12:15 - learn them but with what soft skills
12:20 - that's something that that you know a
12:22 - lot of them take a long time to develop
12:24 - or they can't be taught so really focus
12:27 - on your negotiation skills your soft
12:29 - skills they're very important like the
12:34 - effect that they have on your salary
12:35 - with just a quantitative part and then
12:38 - you know forget about the qualitative
12:40 - part right the relationships that you
12:42 - build your coworkers because you're
12:43 - gonna spend a lot of time in the job
12:45 - that you're at so you want those people
12:49 - to be happy and you also want yourself
12:51 - to have a good time you don't want to
12:53 - just go to work 9:00 to 5:00 hate your
12:55 - job come back home tired not be able to
12:57 - give time high quality time to your
12:59 - friends and family and just be frankly a
13:03 - crappy person so that's why it's really
13:07 - important to work on your soft skills
13:09 - and you know for those of you guys who
13:11 - don't know what I mean when I says soft
13:13 - skills is people's skills
13:15 - human skills because ultimately no
13:18 - matter what you're doing even if you're
13:20 - writing code in front of us
13:21 - green the whole day you're working with
13:23 - humans you know almost all of the time
13:25 - even the code that you're told to write
13:27 - is actually some human coming up to you
13:29 - and saying hey I just talked to the
13:32 - manager and he says we need to optimize
13:34 - the button because it's leading to less
13:36 - conversions because people come to this
13:37 - website and then it's like kind of
13:39 - broken and it's not working so hey you
13:40 - software web developer whatever can you
13:43 - fix that and then also make sure that it
13:45 - looks better and it's like green so then
13:48 - they want to click instead of red so you
13:51 - want to be able to talk with them
13:53 - understand their problem make sure they
13:56 - like you and then you know you go on and
13:58 - work on your part about coding so I
14:01 - would suggest you know focus on
14:04 - technical skills technical skills are
14:05 - great but one of the biggest mistakes I
14:07 - made when I was starting out was I
14:09 - focused way to much on technical skills
14:12 - I'm really one minded and I have trouble
14:15 - multitasking so when I started going
14:17 - into one thing I just go crazy like for
14:19 - example when I started out I was doing
14:21 - 20-hour days studying computer
14:23 - programming like literally 20-hour days
14:26 - so boombox what's your question you said
14:29 - can you I don't know what you mean by
14:33 - that
14:33 - it just said can you with three question
14:35 - lines can you I can't so focus on that
14:42 - and then that will honestly help you not
14:45 - only live a better life and have people
14:48 - like you and you like yourself but also
14:51 - quantitatively help you improve your
14:53 - salary and be able to negotiate
14:55 - something better for yourself and why I
14:58 - talk a lot about money a lot about those
15:00 - things because ultimately that's what we
15:02 - want to do right as a software developer
15:04 - program we're going to land a job so we
15:06 - don't have to work crazy hard but then
15:09 - be able to earn some kind of income and
15:11 - also you know bonuses digitize your
15:14 - ideas so you are creating your ideas
15:16 - bring it to life creating a game or
15:17 - whatever so those are all the things
15:21 - that we're doing right and then again
15:22 - the reason why I'm emphasizing money is
15:24 - because if you do that part right you
15:27 - are cutting down a lot of your time you
15:31 - don't have to spend years how is this a
15:33 - chess championship
15:34 - you are right I am sorry this is a
15:36 - terrible Title I is the Chess
15:40 - Championship because I'm I brought the
15:42 - Nosler chess team I'm their chess coach
15:45 - so I brought them here to play chess and
15:49 - currently there you know I'm in my room
15:53 - but the tournament actually starts
15:56 - tomorrow so we got here today I don't
15:59 - know what day it is it's Thursday right
16:01 - there's or something and then the
16:03 - tournament I think goes Friday and
16:04 - Saturday and Sunday so it's like 3d
16:07 - tournament so you know it's like a
16:09 - pretty big deal it's a pretty serious
16:11 - event and stay state championship so
16:13 - yeah that sort of can learn coding
16:15 - online is that question it looks like a
16:19 - statement somebody just said can learn
16:21 - coding online so yes you can learn
16:23 - coding online I'm 16 hi there anyway I
16:28 - can get a job program - I know Java okay
16:31 - I've tried to read it very fast so
16:33 - here's what I got from your question you
16:36 - said you're 16 sorry I'm reading other
16:41 - questions you said you're 16 and can you
16:44 - get a job and you know a little bit of
16:46 - Java yes yes if you're 16 you can get a
16:51 - job you don't need to have a certain age
16:54 - you don't need to have a certain degree
16:56 - you'd like these are all like [ __ ]
16:59 - limitations that we put on ourselves and
17:01 - put these barriers so we have an excuse
17:05 - to sleep at night and be better and this
17:07 - is something garyvee would do I've been
17:09 - listening garyvee a lot you know
17:13 - yes your to your answer yes you can
17:16 - certainly get a job there people who are
17:17 - looking for work and if you can't help
17:19 - them yes you can do a job there are tons
17:22 - of like 16 15 euro CEOs running
17:24 - companies so for you yeah if there's
17:28 - work you can find clients you can you
17:30 - can do a job now do you have to go the
17:31 - traditional route like try to apply to
17:33 - Google try to apply Dropbox try to apply
17:35 - like these big companies yeah you can
17:37 - but there is good money in actually
17:39 - getting private clients or software you
17:41 - know doing independent software
17:43 - consulting where you're either going
17:45 - door-to-door knocking like
17:47 - can I build a website for you or can I
17:48 - do this for you or whatever or you can
17:50 - go to meetups meetup groups and connect
17:53 - with people around you network with them
17:54 - and then see if there are people who
17:56 - want to digitize some idea and if you
17:59 - have the skill set and they are willing
18:01 - to pay you then you guys can form a
18:03 - partnership and then work on that okay
18:05 - so if you're 16 years old
18:07 - yes you can make money doing this also
18:10 - see my video for ways to make money
18:13 - doing computer programming you can teach
18:15 - somebody you don't even have to know
18:16 - what you have you have to know very
18:18 - little and you can actually go and teach
18:20 - people programming and no you're not
18:23 - stealing them out of their money
18:24 - you're I'm not trying to take tell you
18:26 - like be a con you're not faking your way
18:28 - out of it right as long as you're
18:31 - providing them value and helping them
18:32 - get to the next level you can charge
18:34 - people and they'll be happy to pay you
18:36 - because you're helping them and before
18:39 - you guys say oh but I don't have
18:41 - experience I'm not an expert look it
18:42 - doesn't you don't have to be an expert
18:44 - because somebody who connects with you
18:49 - they'll connect with you exactly because
18:52 - you're not so far advanced somebody
18:53 - who's so far in math has that ever
18:54 - happened to you where somebody your math
18:56 - teacher you ask them a question did you
18:58 - have no idea what the heck you were
18:59 - talking about or they gave you an
19:00 - example that made no sense but it makes
19:03 - sense to probably PhD professors you
19:06 - know why that happened cuz they're so
19:07 - far ahead of you you're experts through
19:09 - the real experts they're so far ahead of
19:12 - you that you can't relate and it doesn't
19:14 - help you with anything so you don't have
19:16 - to be an expert if you're one step ahead
19:18 - of them and you can help them get up
19:19 - they'll be able to better connect with
19:21 - you and they would want to work with you
19:23 - more so can you get a job doing Java you
19:26 - can teach Java have private lessons or
19:28 - you can find people in your local
19:31 - community but local businesses and yes
19:34 - you can make money as a 16 year old
19:36 - knowing Java that's how I would answer
19:39 - that question Wow
19:44 - we have 15 people this is super cool any
19:51 - questions
19:52 - bring them guys come on what's up yeah
19:56 - Aden Moop sure aahed
19:59 - if I'm saying it right hopefully I'm
20:01 - singing right I had hi what's up I don't
20:05 - know nothing much
20:06 - probably the roof huh I am you don't
20:11 - know here for a chess tournament but the
20:13 - team is not here right now right this
20:15 - second and why not to eat and instead of
20:16 - eating I stayed here so I can spend some
20:19 - time with you guys okay
20:21 - that's what I'm doing I'm like huge
20:23 - screw you guys I need to spend time with
20:25 - you guys
20:26 - I can't stay disciplined Solo saw me
20:28 - learning plan where should I learn okay
20:31 - I'm so overwhelmed with so many
20:35 - platforms where should I learn okay guys
20:40 - hold on let me get a pen because some of
20:42 - you guys are writing and on my phone it
20:44 - literally shows me for like three
20:46 - seconds and then I okay okay so first of
21:00 - all relax don't be able to realm because
21:02 - computer programming is such a fun field
21:04 - that is so exciting especially that you
21:06 - can build your ideas one thing that
21:09 - overwhelm comes from is if you're only
21:11 - doing it to do homework if you're only
21:13 - doing it to get a job and make money
21:15 - right if those are some of your only
21:18 - reasons you're gonna feel this constant
21:20 - overwhelm and this is what I emphasize
21:22 - in a lot of my videos like really have
21:25 - fun enjoy okay this is a process of
21:29 - building experimentation and you having
21:32 - fun learn a little bit of somebody who's
21:34 - teaching you like you didn't even follow
21:36 - basic tutorials on YouTube and as you're
21:39 - building something stop the video and
21:42 - then go out and then just practice it on
21:45 - your own if you don't play with it you
21:47 - won't get good at it don't just be doing
21:50 - things to pass an exam
21:52 - don't just be doing things to pass a
21:54 - certain course or get 100% in the course
21:57 - but the more time you spend playing the
21:59 - better you'll get was like hell I'm in
22:00 - class um oh man that went by really fast
22:02 - you're gonna have to write that one
22:04 - again buddy so I'm still answering your
22:06 - question spend time playing with it okay
22:10 - that's how you're going to get good
22:12 - at it and in that's how the feeling of
22:15 - overwhelm is gonna is gonna be gone
22:17 - regarding resources I know it's
22:19 - overwhelming there's too many resources
22:21 - in my video how to teach yourself code I
22:23 - talked about what resources you can use
22:25 - but even there you know there's tons of
22:28 - resources now here's what I'll well but
22:30 - I will say ok I will just be a bad
22:32 - market or if I don't promote myself here
22:34 - my Python courses I think are really
22:37 - good but feel free to look around in
22:39 - some other Python courses if I work well
22:41 - with you if with the way I talk connects
22:44 - with you then you should go through my
22:46 - courses I think they're good too tested
22:48 - and tried by like hundred thousand
22:51 - people plus at this point including on
22:53 - my website so that will really help you
22:55 - and all my courses are free except for
22:58 - the learn Python op1 ok and don't jump
23:01 - on that one just yet that's about
23:02 - building apps if you know a little bit
23:04 - of the free course like learn Python you
23:06 - follow it you start getting a little bit
23:08 - proficient then maybe you can jump in
23:11 - the paid one but don't go to it yet you
23:13 - need some experience ok I mean you can
23:16 - do it from zero like zero experience but
23:20 - I think it's better if you actually
23:21 - learn a little bit of like basic Python
23:24 - first it'll help you when you're
23:26 - actually building apps in the learn
23:27 - Python olp course so learn Python course
23:30 - that I have it's on my website is
23:32 - completely free that you can take and it
23:34 - has exercises that are step-by-step ok
23:37 - there's a full community so you can
23:38 - comment and ask questions and then
23:40 - somebody you know will jump in there and
23:42 - answer you it has a learning management
23:45 - system so it tracks like naturally spoke
23:47 - for your career so if you left off
23:49 - somewhere and you go and you know go to
23:52 - sleep or you got to go watch a movie
23:53 - with your friends you come back before
23:55 - sleeping you know you're just laying
23:56 - down on your bed you know like okay let
23:57 - me just watch a little bit you'll
23:59 - remember where you left off so you can
24:01 - continue from there but if you know what
24:03 - I'm thinking on website feel free to
24:04 - just take it on YouTube it's on YouTube
24:06 - it's called learn Python programming it
24:08 - starts from complete beginner zero zero
24:12 - knowledge ok mmm nada and then we build
24:16 - up and we become better and we become
24:18 - proficient thinkers we think we started
24:21 - think like computer programmers and then
24:23 - we learn Python as a byproduct okay then
24:26 - we do exercises and projects so like the
24:29 - final project is rock-paper-scissors for
24:31 - example you build a whole game and it'll
24:33 - have a graphical user interface and then
24:35 - you can actually share that link that
24:37 - app with your friends and family so that
24:41 - is pretty cool I think I think that's a
24:44 - great resource to get started off with
24:46 - okay you look confident maybe I enroll a
24:48 - software engineer does what a software
24:50 - engineer does okay I look confident
24:53 - maybe learn roll sure you're generous
24:55 - guy give him your tennis okay
24:57 - Collins thank you thank you thank you
24:59 - Bryson I think you asked me about how
25:02 - good I am at chess I am pretty okay at
25:05 - chess I am very hungry I'm a modest
25:10 - person modest people don't say they're
25:12 - modest but I believe it or not I am but
25:16 - to give you a real perspective I am top
25:19 - 1% in the world I have a rating of 2,000
25:23 - so that puts me as a chess expert and I
25:27 - think I'm pretty okay there are
25:29 - bajillion players that are better than
25:30 - me and I will get my ass handed to me
25:33 - when I played them so some grandmasters
25:35 - or even one of my friends I think I
25:36 - might record playing with him his name
25:38 - is Eric Rosen he's like 2,400 2,500 and
25:41 - he's so good so yeah I mean chess is
25:46 - very it gets very involved you know it's
25:48 - a very deep game so yeah lately I
25:52 - haven't been keeping up with it you know
25:54 - I haven't been studying it or going to
25:55 - tournaments but yeah I have played in
25:57 - international tournaments and in local
25:59 - tournaments and things like that so it's
26:01 - a lot of fun it's a great game to
26:03 - exerciser to brain and kind of stay
26:05 - sharp so you know like I do a lot of
26:09 - things I did it's ooh I do lifting I do
26:11 - programming I do soccer I do chest ton
26:15 - of things but does a few things that I
26:16 - love doing a lot you know that would be
26:19 - chess which is I'm doing less of it now
26:22 - and then programming which I'm doing a
26:24 - lot of now and then now videos I love
26:27 - making videos and I think one of my
26:29 - favorite things to do is actually get to
26:31 - talk to you guys like it's so weird I'm
26:33 - sitting here alone okay
26:34 - but I feel that I have all that
26:36 - in the world because I don't know I just
26:38 - feel like you're right there with me I
26:40 - don't know if that makes sense but well
26:43 - that's just how I feel so more questions
26:47 - you know I'll try to answer them I'm
26:49 - sorry those questions go by so fast it's
26:51 - really hard for me to read sometimes but
26:55 - if you guys have any more questions go
26:57 - ahead ask them and I will try my best to
27:00 - answer them for you I also don't know
27:03 - how long the lag is I wish there was a
27:05 - way for me to find out how many times do
27:12 - you guys think I should do this in a
27:13 - week once twice
27:17 - zero times okay so guys I am getting bad
27:27 - connection and I think that I have got
27:30 - to go okay I think I have got to go I
27:40 - mean it just says bad connection so I
27:43 - think I'm gonna go because I don't want
27:45 - you guys to have a crappy session like
27:47 - and not enjoy it because it's slow so
27:50 - I'm gonna let you guys go thank you guys
27:52 - for coming I love you guys so much
27:54 - I'm serious like I love you guys so much
27:57 - thank you thank you thank you for coming
27:59 - watching and enjoying and asking
28:01 - questions participating and as always I
28:05 - will see you beautiful people in the
28:08 - next video that was bad yeah one two
28:19 - stop streaming okay when I say stop
28:22 - streaming

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys how's it going so this is my first ever live session Oh we'll kind of see how it goes I am at chest state championships hi hi Colin how are you doing hi yeah your first your first hi hello how are you guys doing hi Maude this is the first session ever oh wow give soit people hey how's it going JP Gaming evig I'm trying to read your guys's names so I am here for a Chess Championship for State I'm bringing my high school chess team I am their coach and so I'm helping them out here and it's kind of we're just having a good time really so I just decided to go on live chat it's my first time ever and I wanted to just talk with you guys for a little bit before we decide to actually you know I'm skipping dinner for this so they went ahead to eat at Olive Garden and I decided to kind of stay back and I'm like you guys go ahead I think I'm gonna stay here and just have a chat with you beautiful people so that's what I'm here to do um just to tell you guys a little bit about what's kind of going on it's a high school championship the high school is now North High Evek awesome obviously they're doing great thank you harsh kamar says nice Thank You Ches Phillip yes Carter hi Carter lamps up so we are going to be playing in the state championship and today is like the rest day today we just got here we got our hotels this is my room and one of my friends is probably going to be coming here and what I did is I decided to bring some PI H ap gaming I decided bring some equipment with me so maybe you know I wanted to do something recording or shooting so you can see that I brought brought some stuff you know like a little bit tripod or whatever and right now I'm actually just recording with my phone so it's kind of crazy YouTube came up with this new feature where you can actually just go live with your phone so that's effectively what I am doing but I am working on some I have a few videos for you guys already that I I put together but didn't get time to push them out to you guys so I'm sorry about that I apologize other than that I am recording a little bit of playing chest live so playing really fast games where I have like 30 seconds or 10 seconds and then who I'm playing with they'll have like 2 minutes or 5 minutes and then I've kind of recorded it so everybody who's following me a snapchat got to see a lot of that so I would say if you have snapchat add me it's Roffe a 1 RAF eh 1 and yeah you kind of get a peek at what's going on behind the scenes and if you have any questions you know I usually will personally reply back to you or even if you're following along with the story that's going on I will usually answer lots of questions if you guys have any questions right now about coding or programming go ahead and start typing them in or if you guys have questions general questions RAF eh one so maybe I can write it here no um can i right here with you guys no unfortunately it looks like I can't write so it's are a fh1 so yeah add me there but anyways if you have any general questions about life if you have questions about which college you should go to or what can you do with program or what programming language you should start off with or is it too late for you to start programming you know any kind of questions you have I would be happy more than happy to answer them for you and you know in the longer run we will be doing live coding sessions to where we'll actually build something together this was just kind of for fun I thought that I didn't get a chance to see you guys today so I decided to kind of just do this so if you guys have questions start putting them in little thing in the little box oh and I did a live webinar with all the students wretchedly enrolled in the learn Python course well okay one second they said that I should install mantra pack one what program in or should I have start okay harsh Kumar I'm gonna ask you a question so that's a great question he says what programming language should I start with now I have a video that answers that it's called what programming language that I learned first and if you look it up it ranks first so haha engineer truth no I'm just kidding I love you engineer truth okay I'll kind of answer that question right here as well you want to start with something simple okay if it's in real life if it's an ink you know you're trying to pick up a language you don't want to start off with a really complicated language even if you're trying to speak to another human being imagine if you're trying to teach a language to somebody who's never spoken before you'll try to teach them some kind of easy language something that's not super difficult so I would I would ask you to reframe your way of thinking and and do that with basically think about that about programming like that okay so you should pick the programming language which is a way to talk to a computer exactly the way you would about go and go about that in a human language so pick something simple I mean some of the simplest stuff you can start off with a scratch actually which is built by MIT which is built to visually use blocks of code and many things happen now that's a really good place to start off with but the reason why I don't personally recommend that as a first language to start off with is because while it's good to build your fundamentals that gives you strong fundamentals you can't really develop real apps and real things with it so I recommend a language that's fairly easy but also very powerful which is Python so you know like I always say like Instagram is built off of it and then one alt likes majority of Google is actually written in Python so it's a very powerful language but it's also very simple its syntax is very simple you don't have to worry about all this squiggly and all that stuff and then when you're using libraries which is like stealing code it's super easy and by stealing me the code I mean actually ethically stealing code I you know using somebody's libraries or opensource framework and then building on top of that it's as easy as just saying import blah blah blah and then that's it you're done which in for example if you're working with C you might have to get to the binary level and go to C make and really install everything from scratch you know for those of you guys who were doing video like recognition you know data analytics or whatever some some intensive stuff in computer science and programming try to make OpenCV work would see its hell it's a lot of work but now try to make it work with Python and if you get the anaconda manager I mean it's like at one line and it just installs everything for you so you know if somebody doesn't know any language for me to go in a lot of depth wouldn't really make that much sense for you but I will just say that it's a very easy language to start off with and it's the benefits of how easy it is really keep showing as you progress to more advanced stuff in Python you'll start to see how you can do really big things really quickly so even with a few lines of code you can actually do video detection and image recognition and thing like that and in our course with the kind of things that we're working on is essentially building GUI applications which is called graphical user interface so instead of just writing code that runs in your command line or terminal I mean that's really cool because you know we're all nerds that's awesome for us we run it and we don't care it's awesome but if you're trying to show your girlfriend if you're trying to show your boyfriend or whoever right your friends they're gonna be like yeah you know it's they're not gonna get it if they have to use a command line to run your code they're gonna be like what the heck is this so if you build a graphical user interface were there clicking buttons and graphical things are showing up and blah blah on the back Python code is running but they don't really they don't need to know that they just work on the graphical part of it then it's fun for them and they want to use your app and they also want to you know then learn how they can code themselves as well so that's the things that we're focusing on in our Python courses like really building apps and those of you guys who are either new or have been watching my channel but haven't really or don't really know that I make coding tutorials because I do a lot of life advice type of stuff but yeah there's a ton of tutorials or son of content you can start off with Python I think it's a great language for you to actually start off with but let's say that your goal is completely different and you want to do something like web development and just completely frontend stuff then JavaScript and HTML those are good language to start off with but what I would say is you can still combine that with Python so on the back end like all the heavy lifting you can use Python with and on the front end to make things look beautiful you could use JavaScript HTML things of that nature okay awesome good questions is there anybody else who has a question I'll jump on it right now and answer it for you if you have a question and drop it right in there I'm gonna wait for you I am waiting for you cool let's see the room it's alright it's alright okay no questions you guys suck you guys don't got any questions so you know I'm just gonna go ahead and talk a little bit feel free to watch you know soft skills the reason why I talk about them so much and I emphasize them so much is because let's be honest they are the things that will get you to work with other people that will get other people to like you and work with you because as humans were very emotional creatures so people who want to like for example right you can train somebody how to make a sandwich but you can't train them how to be happy right so if you have a really unhappy employee I mean and then know how to make a sandwich like big deal you can hire somebody else who's happy who doesn't know how to make a sandwich and then you can teach them how to make a sandwich but you can't teach that unhappy person to be happy right so door certain traits can't be taught technical skills you can pick up a book or whatever and you can actually just learn them but with what soft skills that's something that that you know a lot of them take a long time to develop or they can't be taught so really focus on your negotiation skills your soft skills they're very important like the effect that they have on your salary with just a quantitative part and then you know forget about the qualitative part right the relationships that you build your coworkers because you're gonna spend a lot of time in the job that you're at so you want those people to be happy and you also want yourself to have a good time you don't want to just go to work 900 to 500 hate your job come back home tired not be able to give time high quality time to your friends and family and just be frankly a crappy person so that's why it's really important to work on your soft skills and you know for those of you guys who don't know what I mean when I says soft skills is people's skills human skills because ultimately no matter what you're doing even if you're writing code in front of us green the whole day you're working with humans you know almost all of the time even the code that you're told to write is actually some human coming up to you and saying hey I just talked to the manager and he says we need to optimize the button because it's leading to less conversions because people come to this website and then it's like kind of broken and it's not working so hey you software web developer whatever can you fix that and then also make sure that it looks better and it's like green so then they want to click instead of red so you want to be able to talk with them understand their problem make sure they like you and then you know you go on and work on your part about coding so I would suggest you know focus on technical skills technical skills are great but one of the biggest mistakes I made when I was starting out was I focused way to much on technical skills I'm really one minded and I have trouble multitasking so when I started going into one thing I just go crazy like for example when I started out I was doing 20hour days studying computer programming like literally 20hour days so boombox what's your question you said can you I don't know what you mean by that it just said can you with three question lines can you I can't so focus on that and then that will honestly help you not only live a better life and have people like you and you like yourself but also quantitatively help you improve your salary and be able to negotiate something better for yourself and why I talk a lot about money a lot about those things because ultimately that's what we want to do right as a software developer program we're going to land a job so we don't have to work crazy hard but then be able to earn some kind of income and also you know bonuses digitize your ideas so you are creating your ideas bring it to life creating a game or whatever so those are all the things that we're doing right and then again the reason why I'm emphasizing money is because if you do that part right you are cutting down a lot of your time you don't have to spend years how is this a chess championship you are right I am sorry this is a terrible Title I is the Chess Championship because I'm I brought the Nosler chess team I'm their chess coach so I brought them here to play chess and currently there you know I'm in my room but the tournament actually starts tomorrow so we got here today I don't know what day it is it's Thursday right there's or something and then the tournament I think goes Friday and Saturday and Sunday so it's like 3d tournament so you know it's like a pretty big deal it's a pretty serious event and stay state championship so yeah that sort of can learn coding online is that question it looks like a statement somebody just said can learn coding online so yes you can learn coding online I'm 16 hi there anyway I can get a job program I know Java okay I've tried to read it very fast so here's what I got from your question you said you're 16 sorry I'm reading other questions you said you're 16 and can you get a job and you know a little bit of Java yes yes if you're 16 you can get a job you don't need to have a certain age you don't need to have a certain degree you'd like these are all like [ __ ] limitations that we put on ourselves and put these barriers so we have an excuse to sleep at night and be better and this is something garyvee would do I've been listening garyvee a lot you know yes your to your answer yes you can certainly get a job there people who are looking for work and if you can't help them yes you can do a job there are tons of like 16 15 euro CEOs running companies so for you yeah if there's work you can find clients you can you can do a job now do you have to go the traditional route like try to apply to Google try to apply Dropbox try to apply like these big companies yeah you can but there is good money in actually getting private clients or software you know doing independent software consulting where you're either going doortodoor knocking like can I build a website for you or can I do this for you or whatever or you can go to meetups meetup groups and connect with people around you network with them and then see if there are people who want to digitize some idea and if you have the skill set and they are willing to pay you then you guys can form a partnership and then work on that okay so if you're 16 years old yes you can make money doing this also see my video for ways to make money doing computer programming you can teach somebody you don't even have to know what you have you have to know very little and you can actually go and teach people programming and no you're not stealing them out of their money you're I'm not trying to take tell you like be a con you're not faking your way out of it right as long as you're providing them value and helping them get to the next level you can charge people and they'll be happy to pay you because you're helping them and before you guys say oh but I don't have experience I'm not an expert look it doesn't you don't have to be an expert because somebody who connects with you they'll connect with you exactly because you're not so far advanced somebody who's so far in math has that ever happened to you where somebody your math teacher you ask them a question did you have no idea what the heck you were talking about or they gave you an example that made no sense but it makes sense to probably PhD professors you know why that happened cuz they're so far ahead of you you're experts through the real experts they're so far ahead of you that you can't relate and it doesn't help you with anything so you don't have to be an expert if you're one step ahead of them and you can help them get up they'll be able to better connect with you and they would want to work with you more so can you get a job doing Java you can teach Java have private lessons or you can find people in your local community but local businesses and yes you can make money as a 16 year old knowing Java that's how I would answer that question Wow we have 15 people this is super cool any questions bring them guys come on what's up yeah Aden Moop sure aahed if I'm saying it right hopefully I'm singing right I had hi what's up I don't know nothing much probably the roof huh I am you don't know here for a chess tournament but the team is not here right now right this second and why not to eat and instead of eating I stayed here so I can spend some time with you guys okay that's what I'm doing I'm like huge screw you guys I need to spend time with you guys I can't stay disciplined Solo saw me learning plan where should I learn okay I'm so overwhelmed with so many platforms where should I learn okay guys hold on let me get a pen because some of you guys are writing and on my phone it literally shows me for like three seconds and then I okay okay so first of all relax don't be able to realm because computer programming is such a fun field that is so exciting especially that you can build your ideas one thing that overwhelm comes from is if you're only doing it to do homework if you're only doing it to get a job and make money right if those are some of your only reasons you're gonna feel this constant overwhelm and this is what I emphasize in a lot of my videos like really have fun enjoy okay this is a process of building experimentation and you having fun learn a little bit of somebody who's teaching you like you didn't even follow basic tutorials on YouTube and as you're building something stop the video and then go out and then just practice it on your own if you don't play with it you won't get good at it don't just be doing things to pass an exam don't just be doing things to pass a certain course or get 100% in the course but the more time you spend playing the better you'll get was like hell I'm in class um oh man that went by really fast you're gonna have to write that one again buddy so I'm still answering your question spend time playing with it okay that's how you're going to get good at it and in that's how the feeling of overwhelm is gonna is gonna be gone regarding resources I know it's overwhelming there's too many resources in my video how to teach yourself code I talked about what resources you can use but even there you know there's tons of resources now here's what I'll well but I will say ok I will just be a bad market or if I don't promote myself here my Python courses I think are really good but feel free to look around in some other Python courses if I work well with you if with the way I talk connects with you then you should go through my courses I think they're good too tested and tried by like hundred thousand people plus at this point including on my website so that will really help you and all my courses are free except for the learn Python op1 ok and don't jump on that one just yet that's about building apps if you know a little bit of the free course like learn Python you follow it you start getting a little bit proficient then maybe you can jump in the paid one but don't go to it yet you need some experience ok I mean you can do it from zero like zero experience but I think it's better if you actually learn a little bit of like basic Python first it'll help you when you're actually building apps in the learn Python olp course so learn Python course that I have it's on my website is completely free that you can take and it has exercises that are stepbystep ok there's a full community so you can comment and ask questions and then somebody you know will jump in there and answer you it has a learning management system so it tracks like naturally spoke for your career so if you left off somewhere and you go and you know go to sleep or you got to go watch a movie with your friends you come back before sleeping you know you're just laying down on your bed you know like okay let me just watch a little bit you'll remember where you left off so you can continue from there but if you know what I'm thinking on website feel free to just take it on YouTube it's on YouTube it's called learn Python programming it starts from complete beginner zero zero knowledge ok mmm nada and then we build up and we become better and we become proficient thinkers we think we started think like computer programmers and then we learn Python as a byproduct okay then we do exercises and projects so like the final project is rockpaperscissors for example you build a whole game and it'll have a graphical user interface and then you can actually share that link that app with your friends and family so that is pretty cool I think I think that's a great resource to get started off with okay you look confident maybe I enroll a software engineer does what a software engineer does okay I look confident maybe learn roll sure you're generous guy give him your tennis okay Collins thank you thank you thank you Bryson I think you asked me about how good I am at chess I am pretty okay at chess I am very hungry I'm a modest person modest people don't say they're modest but I believe it or not I am but to give you a real perspective I am top 1% in the world I have a rating of 2,000 so that puts me as a chess expert and I think I'm pretty okay there are bajillion players that are better than me and I will get my ass handed to me when I played them so some grandmasters or even one of my friends I think I might record playing with him his name is Eric Rosen he's like 2,400 2,500 and he's so good so yeah I mean chess is very it gets very involved you know it's a very deep game so yeah lately I haven't been keeping up with it you know I haven't been studying it or going to tournaments but yeah I have played in international tournaments and in local tournaments and things like that so it's a lot of fun it's a great game to exerciser to brain and kind of stay sharp so you know like I do a lot of things I did it's ooh I do lifting I do programming I do soccer I do chest ton of things but does a few things that I love doing a lot you know that would be chess which is I'm doing less of it now and then programming which I'm doing a lot of now and then now videos I love making videos and I think one of my favorite things to do is actually get to talk to you guys like it's so weird I'm sitting here alone okay but I feel that I have all that in the world because I don't know I just feel like you're right there with me I don't know if that makes sense but well that's just how I feel so more questions you know I'll try to answer them I'm sorry those questions go by so fast

a way for me to find out how many times do you guys think I should do this in a week once twice zero times okay so guys I am getting bad connection and I think that I have got to go okay I think I
