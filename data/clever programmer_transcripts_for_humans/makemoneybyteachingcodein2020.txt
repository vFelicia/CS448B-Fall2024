00:00 - let's go let's do it so
00:03 - the first avenue guys is what kazi
00:06 - the first avenue is becoming
00:10 - i love this becoming a teacher so
00:13 - you can actually with whatever skills
00:16 - you have learned
00:17 - you can actually teach that to other
00:19 - people and you can make an income
00:22 - from doing that like for example okay
00:25 - this is the craziest example but you
00:26 - guys see we're just teaching you guys
00:28 - we're teachers right sunny and i are
00:31 - teachers
00:32 - sunny and i are not just like going
00:35 - crazy working at a job right now
00:36 - we're actually taking the time out to
00:38 - actually teach you guys
00:40 - and we're even getting donations and
00:42 - we're getting paid to teach
00:44 - literally and so what it looks like at a
00:47 - one-on-one basis
00:48 - and is you can actually post your ad on
00:50 - craigslist
00:51 - and you could post your ads on kijiji if
00:53 - you're in canada or you can post your ad
00:56 - on
00:56 - really whatever platform you want and
00:58 - somebody can pay you for you to teach
01:00 - them
01:01 - and you don't have to be so far ahead of
01:03 - them you can just be a little bit ahead
01:04 - of them and charge them
01:06 - for uh teaching them yeah
01:10 - exactly and guys this is one this is one
01:12 - that i really emphasize
01:13 - in our course a lot with our students
01:15 - because this is the one that you can
01:17 - literally start doing
01:18 - even a week after you start learning how
01:20 - to code like if you're a week ahead of
01:22 - somebody who's never coded before
01:24 - you're now you're now in a position to
01:26 - provide a week's worth of value to
01:28 - somebody who's never coded before so you
01:29 - can actually go ahead and start teaching
01:31 - that
01:31 - right and then only from that day
01:33 - onwards that value only grows
01:35 - right so if you're immediately we're
01:37 - going to grow your income source and you
01:39 - and
01:39 - the earlier you start the better and it
01:41 - is uncomfortable but like when you just
01:43 - jump in dive into the deep end
01:44 - you're going to go ahead and build that
01:45 - skill and it's always going to be a
01:47 - skill that you can turn to to make some
01:48 - more income
01:49 - yep now this is one way that we'd like
01:52 - to show it to you guys okay so let me go
01:54 - ahead and do that for you guys so let's
01:56 - go ahead here and take a look at this
01:58 - what sunny is saying right so sunny
02:00 - you're saying if i have like literally
02:03 - if you think about
02:04 - levels right let's say you're a complete
02:06 - beginner and you're at level one
02:08 - you just know how to write hello world
02:11 - and then
02:11 - here is level 10 where you use
02:14 - server-side rendering for [ __ ]
02:16 - breakfast
02:18 - so in between all these levels
02:22 - and then let's say you're doing
02:23 - javascript you don't have to you can use
02:25 - any language
02:26 - python or you know go it doesn't matter
02:28 - but let's just use javascript for now
02:31 - and if you are a level one can you teach
02:35 - another level one
02:36 - probably not really right if all you
02:39 - know is hello world
02:41 - you can't really teach much to another
02:43 - person who also knows hello world
02:44 - so if you are over here
02:48 - and actually let's do this right so
02:50 - they're like let's say there's two
02:51 - people
02:52 - here and here yep and um you're
02:56 - like let's say you're on the left-hand
02:57 - side and you're teaching this person
02:59 - okay yeah and this is over here
03:04 - i'm just gonna put a little mark and
03:06 - that's gonna say that's you
03:08 - okay now if you're teaching this person
03:10 - you're gonna
03:11 - they're gonna be paying you in return
03:14 - yep and um if you're a level two
03:20 - it's very possible that you can actually
03:21 - be teaching somebody who's a level one
03:24 - yeah 100 right because you
03:28 - can you can teach them so like for
03:30 - example what does a level two mean maybe
03:32 - you have put in at level two maybe
03:33 - you've put in like 50 hours into coding
03:37 - yeah okay let's say you know how to
03:39 - write functions loops data types you
03:41 - know that stuff
03:43 - yeah you know what array is you know
03:45 - what you know so for example right now
03:47 - you can charge this person you could
03:48 - charge them maybe like
03:49 - ten dollars an hour or fifteen dollars
03:52 - an hour so i'll just put like
03:54 - you know ten dollars at that point you
03:56 - can charge them an hour
03:57 - yeah okay now when you get up to level
04:01 - three and you can teach a level two
04:06 - you're gonna get paid more for that yeah
04:09 - does that make sense so now you might
04:11 - actually make maybe more than ten
04:13 - dollars an hour maybe now you make
04:15 - you know you can make like 18 an hour
04:17 - teaching
04:18 - i just want to stress here guys notice
04:20 - now that your pool
04:22 - of potential students has also grown now
04:24 - you can target level two
04:25 - and level one students yep you can
04:28 - target
04:28 - exactly that's important so you could
04:30 - target both that's huge
04:32 - that's a really good point and then what
04:35 - happens when you're a level
04:36 - four or you're a level five let's say
04:39 - right
04:40 - if you're a level five well what does a
04:42 - level five look like i think a level
04:43 - five is somebody who has
04:45 - put multiple uh you know they have like
04:47 - followed of all of our youtube videos
04:49 - and made all the clones
04:51 - yeah exactly you know they understand
04:53 - like how apis work
04:55 - they understand how uh you know how to
04:58 - put together like
05:00 - their portfolio and they have multiple
05:02 - projects to show for it
05:04 - maybe they don't have real world coding
05:06 - experience where they're getting paid at
05:07 - a job but other than that they're like
05:09 - pretty decent yeah right and that might
05:12 - actually look like what maybe 500 hours
05:14 - of coding
05:15 - or maybe yeah 500 to like
05:18 - 700 hours of coding yeah
05:22 - might actually put you here and now
05:25 - at this level you guys you guys can
05:27 - actually charge a pretty significant
05:29 - amount
05:30 - of income so if you're a level five and
05:32 - you're teaching level fours and stuff
05:34 - like that
05:34 - it's very possible for you guys to make
05:38 - at least in us you know for your own
05:40 - countries you would have to do the rough
05:42 - translation but in us it's very possible
05:45 - for you to charge thirty five dollars an
05:47 - hour or even fifty dollars an hour
05:51 - and you have experience with teaching
05:53 - people right sunny
05:54 - i definitely do yeah so even literally
05:56 - and guys there's no age limit when you
05:58 - come to teaching i've taught people who
05:59 - are like much older than me
06:01 - and i've also taught a student who was
06:02 - young as 12 years old who landed his own
06:04 - client which is insane like
06:06 - that's because it really does not matter
06:08 - what age or
06:09 - or what experience you're at you can
06:11 - teach yeah yep
06:12 - and so if you are teaching other people
06:15 - you just have to do the math right so at
06:17 - 35
06:18 - an hour you know i use teaching to make
06:21 - well over a hundred thousand dollars a
06:22 - year now of course everybody's gonna be
06:24 - at a different
06:25 - level different like how much effort you
06:27 - put into it how much time you put into
06:29 - it
06:29 - but a few of these clients that are
06:32 - paying you either 35
06:34 - or 50 an hour it the math
06:37 - to getting to 1 000
06:41 - a month like that's the first type of
06:43 - math you should do
06:44 - so let's figure out sunny how
06:48 - long would it take like what it would
06:49 - take for us with at fifty dollars an
06:51 - hour
06:52 - to get to making thousand dollars a
06:55 - month
06:55 - okay so if i'm making 50 generally when
07:00 - you have students they'll do
07:02 - about two hour long sessions how long
07:03 - are your sessions with your students
07:05 - they're one hour 30 minutes yeah
07:08 - typically i start with one hour because
07:10 - it's quite an intense session and then
07:12 - i'll
07:12 - eventually see and if they can handle a
07:14 - two hour session so that's it two hours
07:16 - yeah i don't push more than two yeah
07:18 - okay because they get fried in that time
07:21 - so let's say you're doing one hour
07:23 - sessions
07:25 - yeah at fifty dollars an hour
07:28 - yeah right uh you're doing one session
07:30 - per week
07:32 - yeah okay so one x per week that turns
07:35 - out to be four
07:36 - sessions per month right yep
07:41 - and uh how much is that you guys if you
07:43 - have one student
07:46 - at you know doing four times a month
07:50 - at fifty dollars an hour in one month
07:54 - that is two hundred dollars
07:58 - yep now what happens if now what do we
08:02 - need to do sunny to get
08:03 - up to with the same exact math to get up
08:06 - to 1000 a month
08:09 - we just need to land five students yep
08:12 - guys
08:13 - that's it so or increase or increase the
08:16 - frequency of a student but landing five
08:17 - students is going to get you that yeah
08:19 - yep so you can go both ways it's
08:21 - important what sunny just said
08:22 - so you guys can either in it's really
08:25 - hard to increase the
08:26 - price at 50. i mean it's hard to go with
08:28 - that sooner to 75 or 100 to double the
08:30 - price would be tough
08:32 - but what might be a lot more doable is
08:34 - maybe sunny can start to have
08:35 - two hour lessons with those students and
08:37 - now that student will pay
08:39 - sunny 400 a month yeah
08:42 - right exactly or sunny can get a total
08:44 - of five students
08:46 - uh for they each do four
08:49 - x a month sessions at fifty dollars an
08:52 - hour
08:53 - and now that's a thousand dollars a
08:56 - month
08:58 - yeah and guys something i want to stress
09:00 - at this point when you get
09:01 - very good at having a lot more students
09:04 - and uh
09:04 - you can actually get to a point where
09:06 - you can do group sessions so if you find
09:08 - that you're running out of time or you
09:09 - find that you're getting like kind of
09:11 - intense with the timings
09:12 - you can go ahead and run i wouldn't
09:14 - recommend having large groups because
09:16 - you you lose the one to one
09:18 - but you can definitely go ahead and
09:19 - actually go ahead and split like maybe
09:21 - and have a group of three group of four
09:23 - yeah and you can even give them a
09:25 - discount right so for example if you
09:27 - were charging a 50 maybe you charge them
09:29 - 40 per session yeah but now it's a group
09:31 - session so in one hour instead of you
09:33 - making
09:34 - 50 dollars now with three students you
09:36 - make 120
09:38 - in an hour of your time exactly
09:41 - and it's a good deal for all of them
09:44 - yeah it's actually a better deal than
09:45 - them doing one-on-one
09:46 - if they do because they all become a
09:48 - part of the group too and they can all
09:50 - slack each other they can all message
09:52 - each other
09:53 - so that's powerful definitely
09:56 - so i i think that one of the best ways
09:59 - for almost
10:00 - all of you guys including the ones who
10:01 - have a job i think is
10:03 - like guys what would you do if you had
10:05 - extra thousand dollars a month coming in
10:07 - start dropping it in the comments below
10:10 - you know what would the thousand dollars
10:12 - a month
10:12 - allow you to do would it allow you to
10:15 - you know pay your bills
10:17 - would it would you get netflix
10:18 - membership would you get membership
10:20 - to i know gyms are closed but maybe
10:22 - would you get like calisthenics
10:23 - equipment for your home and then do
10:26 - workouts there would you get a course
10:29 - that you've always wanted
10:31 - would you i don't know pay for your
10:33 - parents
10:34 - rent and help out what would a thousand
10:37 - dollars a month allow you to do
10:40 - i think it's important to have those
10:41 - goals because then you will actually
10:43 - want to do
10:44 - more and achieve more other than rather
10:46 - than just like going through life like a
10:48 - zombie
10:50 - yeah and these guys it's really
10:52 - important to determine what your why is
10:54 - like why are you doing
10:56 - this stuff like why are you teaching why
10:57 - are you even here right now
10:59 - trying to learn how to code like
11:00 - remember that because that is going to
11:02 - give you
11:02 - that consistent discipline and
11:05 - motivation to carry on when times get
11:06 - tough
11:07 - yep now this is the math to getting to a
11:11 - thousand a month you guys it's not
11:13 - that freaking hard now to go to
11:16 - 2000 a month what do you need to do and
11:19 - guys here's a better way to look at it
11:20 - this is not a thousand a month
11:24 - this is actually let me write that up
11:26 - top at the top left
11:28 - this is actually five students
11:31 - is 12 000
11:35 - a year yeah that's the right way to look
11:39 - at it
11:39 - it's actually 5 or it's actually 12 000
11:43 - a year
11:45 - yep and if you guys want to get to 24
11:48 - 000 a year or 2 000 a month
11:52 - 10 students
11:55 - and you guys can see the growth here
11:57 - from five to ten students isn't actually
11:59 - a lot but the growth in your income is
12:01 - significant
12:02 - yes very significant so
12:05 - this is something you guys can do guys
12:07 - so easily
12:08 - like their instagram you can go and
12:11 - instagram people on coding channels and
12:13 - start
12:14 - having conversations with them and say i
12:15 - will help you for free
12:17 - for 60 minutes in coding i will jump on
12:20 - a video call with you and help you you
12:23 - can go into a facebook group and
12:25 - ask people if they need help and give
12:27 - them a free session and then at the end
12:29 - of the free session
12:30 - say hey you know i'm glad you enjoyed
12:33 - this
12:33 - if you want me to help you more i'm um
12:36 - you know i charge
12:37 - 25 an hour i charge 10 an hour i charge
12:40 - 35
12:41 - an hour 50 an hour something like that
12:42 - does that make sense you guys
12:44 - you guys can literally do this today you
12:48 - don't need to wait for anything you
12:49 - don't need to wait for anyone
12:51 - so this is possible for you guys now
12:54 - there are
12:55 - online tons of amazing platforms where
12:57 - you guys can go
12:58 - and start teaching so i
13:01 - will give you more ways of making income
13:03 - but this is actually one really big
13:05 - pillar of having your income come in
13:11 - there are important platforms that you
13:12 - guys should know and write down so one
13:13 - is takelessons.com
13:15 - and the other one is wiseand.com so
13:18 - these are really good platforms look
13:20 - in the u.s that are great for finding
13:23 - lessons but if you're not in the us
13:27 - look at people per hour look at
13:30 - fiverr.com
13:32 - yeah and um also you guys have
13:36 - facebook and instagram which is
13:37 - worldwide right you can go into groups
13:40 - programming groups and help people there
13:42 - and you can
13:43 - get clients from there very easily okay
13:46 - we have some students try this strategy
13:47 - and they literally have
13:48 - clients the next day

Cleaned transcript:

let's go let's do it so the first avenue guys is what kazi the first avenue is becoming i love this becoming a teacher so you can actually with whatever skills you have learned you can actually teach that to other people and you can make an income from doing that like for example okay this is the craziest example but you guys see we're just teaching you guys we're teachers right sunny and i are teachers sunny and i are not just like going crazy working at a job right now we're actually taking the time out to actually teach you guys and we're even getting donations and we're getting paid to teach literally and so what it looks like at a oneonone basis and is you can actually post your ad on craigslist and you could post your ads on kijiji if you're in canada or you can post your ad on really whatever platform you want and somebody can pay you for you to teach them and you don't have to be so far ahead of them you can just be a little bit ahead of them and charge them for uh teaching them yeah exactly and guys this is one this is one that i really emphasize in our course a lot with our students because this is the one that you can literally start doing even a week after you start learning how to code like if you're a week ahead of somebody who's never coded before you're now you're now in a position to provide a week's worth of value to somebody who's never coded before so you can actually go ahead and start teaching that right and then only from that day onwards that value only grows right so if you're immediately we're going to grow your income source and you and the earlier you start the better and it is uncomfortable but like when you just jump in dive into the deep end you're going to go ahead and build that skill and it's always going to be a skill that you can turn to to make some more income yep now this is one way that we'd like to show it to you guys okay so let me go ahead and do that for you guys so let's go ahead here and take a look at this what sunny is saying right so sunny you're saying if i have like literally if you think about levels right let's say you're a complete beginner and you're at level one you just know how to write hello world and then here is level 10 where you use serverside rendering for [ __ ] breakfast so in between all these levels and then let's say you're doing javascript you don't have to you can use any language python or you know go it doesn't matter but let's just use javascript for now and if you are a level one can you teach another level one probably not really right if all you know is hello world you can't really teach much to another person who also knows hello world so if you are over here and actually let's do this right so they're like let's say there's two people here and here yep and um you're like let's say you're on the lefthand side and you're teaching this person okay yeah and this is over here i'm just gonna put a little mark and that's gonna say that's you okay now if you're teaching this person you're gonna they're gonna be paying you in return yep and um if you're a level two it's very possible that you can actually be teaching somebody who's a level one yeah 100 right because you can you can teach them so like for example what does a level two mean maybe you have put in at level two maybe you've put in like 50 hours into coding yeah okay let's say you know how to write functions loops data types you know that stuff yeah you know what array is you know what you know so for example right now you can charge this person you could charge them maybe like ten dollars an hour or fifteen dollars an hour so i'll just put like you know ten dollars at that point you can charge them an hour yeah okay now when you get up to level three and you can teach a level two you're gonna get paid more for that yeah does that make sense so now you might actually make maybe more than ten dollars an hour maybe now you make you know you can make like 18 an hour teaching i just want to stress here guys notice now that your pool of potential students has also grown now you can target level two and level one students yep you can target exactly that's important so you could target both that's huge that's a really good point and then what happens when you're a level four or you're a level five let's say right if you're a level five well what does a level five look like i think a level five is somebody who has put multiple uh you know they have like followed of all of our youtube videos and made all the clones yeah exactly you know they understand like how apis work they understand how uh you know how to put together like their portfolio and they have multiple projects to show for it maybe they don't have real world coding experience where they're getting paid at a job but other than that they're like pretty decent yeah right and that might actually look like what maybe 500 hours of coding or maybe yeah 500 to like 700 hours of coding yeah might actually put you here and now at this level you guys you guys can actually charge a pretty significant amount of income so if you're a level five and you're teaching level fours and stuff like that it's very possible for you guys to make at least in us you know for your own countries you would have to do the rough translation but in us it's very possible for you to charge thirty five dollars an hour or even fifty dollars an hour and you have experience with teaching people right sunny i definitely do yeah so even literally and guys there's no age limit when you come to teaching i've taught people who are like much older than me and i've also taught a student who was young as 12 years old who landed his own client which is insane like that's because it really does not matter what age or or what experience you're at you can teach yeah yep and so if you are teaching other people you just have to do the math right so at 35 an hour you know i use teaching to make well over a hundred thousand dollars a year now of course everybody's gonna be at a different level different like how much effort you put into it how much time you put into it but a few of these clients that are paying you either 35 or 50 an hour it the math to getting to 1 000 a month like that's the first type of math you should do so let's figure out sunny how long would it take like what it would take for us with at fifty dollars an hour to get to making thousand dollars a month okay so if i'm making 50 generally when you have students they'll do about two hour long sessions how long are your sessions with your students they're one hour 30 minutes yeah typically i start with one hour because it's quite an intense session and then i'll eventually see and if they can handle a two hour session so that's it two hours yeah i don't push more than two yeah okay because they get fried in that time so let's say you're doing one hour sessions yeah at fifty dollars an hour yeah right uh you're doing one session per week yeah okay so one x per week that turns out to be four sessions per month right yep and uh how much is that you guys if you have one student at you know doing four times a month at fifty dollars an hour in one month that is two hundred dollars yep now what happens if now what do we need to do sunny to get up to with the same exact math to get up to 1000 a month we just need to land five students yep guys that's it so or increase or increase the frequency of a student but landing five students is going to get you that yeah yep so you can go both ways it's important what sunny just said so you guys can either in it's really hard to increase the price at 50. i mean it's hard to go with that sooner to 75 or 100 to double the price would be tough but what might be a lot more doable is maybe sunny can start to have two hour lessons with those students and now that student will pay sunny 400 a month yeah right exactly or sunny can get a total of five students uh for they each do four x a month sessions at fifty dollars an hour and now that's a thousand dollars a month yeah and guys something i want to stress at this point when you get very good at having a lot more students and uh you can actually get to a point where you can do group sessions so if you find that you're running out of time or you find that you're getting like kind of intense with the timings you can go ahead and run i wouldn't recommend having large groups because you you lose the one to one but you can definitely go ahead and actually go ahead and split like maybe and have a group of three group of four yeah and you can even give them a discount right so for example if you were charging a 50 maybe you charge them 40 per session yeah but now it's a group session so in one hour instead of you making 50 dollars now with three students you make 120 in an hour of your time exactly and it's a good deal for all of them yeah it's actually a better deal than them doing oneonone if they do because they all become a part of the group too and they can all slack each other they can all message each other so that's powerful definitely so i i think that one of the best ways for almost all of you guys including the ones who have a job i think is like guys what would you do if you had extra thousand dollars a month coming in start dropping it in the comments below you know what would the thousand dollars a month allow you to do would it allow you to you know pay your bills would it would you get netflix membership would you get membership to i know gyms are closed but maybe would you get like calisthenics equipment for your home and then do workouts there would you get a course that you've always wanted would you i don't know pay for your parents rent and help out what would a thousand dollars a month allow you to do i think it's important to have those goals because then you will actually want to do more and achieve more other than rather than just like going through life like a zombie yeah and these guys it's really important to determine what your why is like why are you doing this stuff like why are you teaching why are you even here right now trying to learn how to code like remember that because that is going to give you that consistent discipline and motivation to carry on when times get tough yep now this is the math to getting to a thousand a month you guys it's not that freaking hard now to go to 2000 a month what do you need to do and guys here's a better way to look at it this is not a thousand a month this is actually let me write that up top at the top left this is actually five students is 12 000 a year yeah that's the right way to look at it it's actually 5 or it's actually 12 000 a year yep and if you guys want to get to 24 000 a year or 2 000 a month 10 students and you guys can see the growth here from five to ten students isn't actually a lot but the growth in your income is significant yes very significant so this is something you guys can do guys so easily like their instagram you can go and instagram people on coding channels and start having conversations with them and say i will help you for free for 60 minutes in coding i will jump on a video call with you and help you you can go into a facebook group and ask people if they need help and give them a free session and then at the end of the free session say hey you know i'm glad you enjoyed this if you want me to help you more i'm um you know i charge 25 an hour i charge 10 an hour i charge 35 an hour 50 an hour something like that does that make sense you guys you guys can literally do this today you don't need to wait for anything you don't need to wait for anyone so this is possible for you guys now there are online tons of amazing platforms where you guys can go and start teaching so i will give you more ways of making income but this is actually one really big pillar of having your income come in there are important platforms that you guys should know and write down so one is takelessons.com and the other one is wiseand.com so these are really good platforms look in the u.s that are great for finding lessons but if you're not in the us look at people per hour look at fiverr.com yeah and um also you guys have facebook and instagram which is worldwide right you can go into groups programming groups and help people there and you can get clients from there very easily okay we have some students try this strategy and they literally have clients the next day
