00:00 - i was watching a front-end developer
00:01 - react to css
00:03 - code so i thought hey how about as a
00:04 - full stack developer i react to some
00:07 - awesome javascript code pens
00:09 - so i came across this kevin powell video
00:11 - and he
00:12 - is talking about css and he's taking a
00:14 - look at some mind-blowing stuff that
00:16 - inspired me and i was like hey how about
00:18 - we take a look at some incredible
00:20 - javascript projects
00:22 - that are done mostly with javascript and
00:24 - we just take a look at them
00:25 - and maybe have a mind-blowing experience
00:28 - together so let's jump
00:29 - right into it so here we have a connect
00:32 - 4 game and it's built using
00:36 - mostly javascript so if you take a look
00:39 - here there's a lot going on in this game
00:41 - tons of it if
00:42 - i went through every single line of this
00:45 - that would take
00:46 - one time but taking a look at this
00:49 - we have a couple of things happening
00:51 - here like if i
00:52 - am looking at this game like look at
00:54 - this right first of all so much is
00:56 - happening
00:56 - whichever column i'm on top of that
00:59 - circle shows up right there
01:01 - and that column gets highlighted that's
01:04 - incredible right and let me click and
01:06 - then it drops so there's a lot of like
01:08 - animation stuff going on here so we'll
01:10 - take a look at the styling
01:12 - for this as well the html seems to be
01:15 - quite simple it's very very basic here
01:17 - just about 70 to 80 lines of html code
01:20 - not much going on on the html side
01:23 - there's quite a lot going on on the css
01:25 - side as well
01:26 - about 200 lines happening here and i
01:28 - believe these
01:29 - keyframes are what are making that
01:31 - animation happen when i click
01:33 - so for example let's comment uh let's
01:36 - take those out to read only
01:38 - how can i edit this let's fork it okay i
01:41 - forked it start again
01:42 - and let's see if we can comment it out
01:44 - beautiful so now it's commented out
01:46 - when i click it it doesn't really know
01:48 - how to behave if i comment all of that
01:50 - out that's adding the bounce
01:52 - actually let's try that again boom so
01:54 - the bounce is happening with these
01:56 - uh with these animations here so let's
01:58 - see if we can add the bounce back in now
02:00 - boom that bounces there that's really
02:02 - nice how we have the bounce happening
02:05 - here
02:05 - hover pointer okay let's take a look now
02:08 - at the javascript side i think that's
02:10 - the side that's um
02:11 - i mean both sides are really interesting
02:13 - here but i also want to take a look at
02:14 - the javascript side quite a bit so
02:16 - on this side we also have a worker here
02:19 - and that worker has
02:20 - our game logic all inside of this so our
02:23 - index.js
02:24 - is making sure it's grabbing our worker
02:27 - and then based off of that it's going so
02:29 - the logic is also important and then how
02:31 - we're able to do all of this stuff
02:32 - happening on the dom that's we're also
02:35 - doing that
02:36 - with javascript as well okay so i'm
02:38 - curious
02:39 - let's see how the row is being column is
02:42 - being highlighted
02:44 - so we have this function called create
02:46 - cursor
02:47 - chip wherever we pass at the index
02:48 - that's where the cursor gets created so
02:50 - for example if i hover over here
02:52 - that chip gets created right on top of
02:54 - this also right on top
02:56 - of this column that's this function
02:58 - create cursor chip so let's find that
03:00 - create cursor chip takes in which player
03:03 - so if it's player two it's gonna be
03:05 - purple if it's player one it's gonna be
03:06 - that turquoise color
03:08 - green color pretty freaking cool project
03:10 - heavy heavy on javascript and logic a
03:13 - lot of fun
03:13 - definitely give yourself a chance to
03:16 - work on something like this but of
03:17 - course there's a lot of css going on in
03:19 - here as well
03:20 - just even this one function here create
03:22 - cursor chip a lot of css
03:24 - being able to retain all this memory
03:26 - then draw those circles then
03:28 - make sure those circles are actually
03:30 - being appended onto
03:32 - every other thing here so really awesome
03:35 - project
03:35 - i love it had ton of fun taking a look
03:37 - at it and now let's take
03:38 - a look at another javascript project so
03:41 - this one is called the terrible
03:43 - cloth the physics of this project is
03:46 - just
03:47 - completely out of this world and that's
03:48 - what kind of blew me away and i was like
03:50 - yo what is happening here but check this
03:52 - out
03:52 - as i hover over it oh like look at
03:54 - how that moves
03:55 - let me refresh and go through it slowly
03:58 - absolutely beautiful i click and i hold
04:00 - and if i right click it cuts like this
04:02 - is just
04:03 - a thing of beauty now i'm not saying as
04:05 - a javascript developer this
04:06 - is what you're going to be doing you
04:08 - have to be a physician to almost make
04:10 - this happen
04:10 - there's a lot of physics going on here
04:12 - so if i could like zoom out here
04:14 - the code a little bit so you can see it
04:16 - but there's tons of physics going on
04:18 - here
04:18 - and the accuracy of the physics house
04:20 - influence gravity
04:22 - jesus i mean space wise spacing tier
04:24 - distance so yeah that type of stuff
04:25 - there's a lot of
04:26 - canvas drawing here and yes tons of
04:29 - physics stuff that i see like
04:31 - i remember even when i was building a
04:33 - game called pong
04:34 - i had to actually apply a lot of physics
04:36 - that i learned in high school that was
04:38 - a lot of fun to make and i made the game
04:40 - with python i remember
04:42 - and it required tons of physics it was
04:44 - cool because i got to
04:45 - take physics that i learned in school
04:46 - and apply it to a actual coding thing
04:48 - and it did
04:49 - real stuff this project freaking awesome
04:51 - heavy on javascript
04:52 - and just the way everything like how
04:55 - bouncy it is right even when i play fifa
04:57 - there's tons of physics in there so when
04:59 - developers are working on
05:00 - things like that in games they really
05:02 - have to go out of their way i mean
05:03 - it's as satisfying to you as it is to me
05:05 - like wow
05:06 - look at that that's just unbelievable
05:09 - unbelievable
05:10 - look at that okay let's go to the next
05:12 - one this is
05:13 - a javascript calculator probably one of
05:15 - the sexiest calculator i've seen to date
05:18 - makes you want to
05:19 - use the calculator to be honest the only
05:21 - thing i wish that this
05:22 - app had is i wish it worked with me
05:25 - typing in my buttons on keyboard it
05:27 - doesn't work with that so here if i do 8
05:30 - plus 8 equals 16. i really like when i
05:33 - type in 8
05:34 - or 7 i like when i type in my numbers
05:37 - it has that like little zoom zoom in
05:39 - effect where the
05:40 - number becomes bigger on the screen and
05:43 - the whole thing just has a very clean
05:44 - look
05:45 - like i even like how there's a little
05:47 - delay as i hover over that c or that
05:49 - seven or that eight
05:51 - gives it a nice little touch and even
05:52 - when i do plus right it has those words
05:55 - coming up like divided by
05:56 - plus minus times you
06:00 - you broke it i love that
06:03 - that's funny taking a look at the code
06:05 - here again
06:06 - the html part of it looks really simple
06:09 - this is
06:09 - class num each number our operators have
06:12 - we have a plus operator here class
06:14 - is ops so all the operators i believe
06:17 - are
06:17 - in our ops class so it has a slightly
06:20 - different styling
06:21 - i think it's because what happens here
06:23 - you need access to
06:24 - all of that stuff so you can actually
06:26 - show it happening there i'm curious
06:28 - i really want to know that eight that
06:30 - eight right how does that become big how
06:31 - does that expand so i'm gonna actually
06:33 - check that out
06:36 - okay so i like the comments here too set
06:39 - num
06:39 - so this is how the number is set which
06:41 - is basically like
06:42 - hey i get the number but when i click
06:44 - eight here
06:45 - this is what sets the number so this is
06:47 - when the number is click get the current
06:49 - number selected so
06:50 - okay i understand how we're getting the
06:51 - current number get attribute data num
06:54 - okay so whatever i'm typing in there is
06:55 - being gotten
06:56 - display the current number so i believe
06:59 - that's
06:59 - maybe there wow i love
07:03 - that so if you do eight divided by zero
07:06 - it goes you broke the universe or it
07:09 - goes uh look at what you've done and it
07:11 - goes reset universe
07:12 - that's beautiful aha that's where it's
07:14 - coming from so in css
07:16 - the value fade ins that appear and so
07:19 - they're happening
07:19 - right here and the content we're getting
07:21 - from data num so for example whatever
07:23 - content i have
07:24 - that's in our data num that is what i
07:27 - believe
07:27 - ends up showing right here so this one
07:29 - really freaking
07:31 - beautiful the front end is awesome love
07:33 - this
07:34 - project really good project and oh by
07:36 - the way i'm i just typed in javascript
07:38 - at the top on codepen and we're just
07:40 - checking out some of the projects there
07:42 - so you could do that too
07:43 - and then look at projects that have
07:44 - javascript in there okay so let's take a
07:46 - look at
07:47 - something else that's interesting so we
07:49 - looked at three projects that's
07:51 - so far that were pretty freaking cool
07:53 - all right so here's another one and i
07:55 - really like this project actually this
07:56 - is really fun we have
07:58 - our chat built here and i can basically
08:00 - send a message so i can be like hey
08:02 - what is going on and if i send this
08:04 - message i get a reply back
08:06 - beautiful all of this is happening
08:08 - without any back end this is just with
08:10 - front end and what's happening
08:12 - is we have our javascript code right
08:14 - here and our javascript code basically
08:16 - we have an array of
08:17 - random messages those random messages
08:20 - are coming out right why did the web
08:22 - developer leave the restaurant because
08:24 - of the table layout
08:25 - and that's this joke right here and
08:27 - that's just being randomly displayed
08:29 - that's good so far and then the rest of
08:31 - it is heavy on css
08:34 - there's a lot of styling going on here
08:36 - right so you have to know how to be able
08:38 - to make a layout like this
08:39 - using html css you can use frameworks
08:42 - you could use grid for this or you could
08:44 - use flexbox
08:45 - and to know okay how are we getting
08:48 - a chat box that looks like this and now
08:50 - my front end skills are not the best as
08:52 - you guys
08:52 - have seen some of my videos right my
08:55 - back and skills are probably a lot
08:57 - better than my front end skills but all
08:59 - of this is happening
09:00 - front end we're sending a message and
09:02 - then we have
09:03 - piece of javascript that essentially
09:05 - waits and then
09:06 - you know i assume it's this set timeout
09:09 - and then we append that to the list of
09:11 - the messages
09:12 - and then we boom send that message but
09:14 - it's
09:15 - fancy because of even how we get the
09:18 - message right when vincent responds it's
09:20 - in green
09:21 - it's on the left hand side it has a
09:24 - timestamp
09:25 - right and what's cool is that it's also
09:26 - pulling the current timestamp
09:28 - timestamp is also styled that's freaking
09:31 - cool
09:31 - it's every response we get it about one
09:34 - and a half
09:35 - second later i believe that's what that
09:36 - 1500 right there
09:38 - probably means we're able to scroll this
09:41 - thing that's also
09:42 - really cool and all of this is pure pure
09:45 - javascript and css so not even libraries
09:48 - or anything like that being used so
09:50 - beautiful project really really awesome
09:52 - i really like it
09:53 - how we have this showing up here we can
09:55 - search oh crap the search works
09:58 - yo what that's awesome i don't even
10:00 - think they're using a react here i don't
10:02 - think so can you react here let's look
10:04 - nope we're just using font awesome well
10:06 - that's for css
10:08 - jquery handlebars but yeah definitely
10:11 - not using react here
10:12 - so really cool project really really
10:14 - awesome project actually to look at chat
10:17 - widget
10:17 - that's it i hope you guys had fun with
10:19 - this video i hope
10:20 - you got to learn something out of it or
10:22 - at least you just had fun look if you
10:24 - enjoy
10:25 - content like this what i recommend you
10:27 - check out is
10:28 - i had a css battle with my boy nas
10:32 - maybe you want to see who want maybe you
10:33 - want to see how it went so what i
10:35 - recommend you to do
10:36 - is go ahead and click that video and go
10:39 - watch that video
10:40 - right now you're going to have a ton of
10:41 - fun you're going to enjoy it
10:43 - with that said i love your beautiful
10:44 - face if you enjoyed the video smash the
10:46 - like button so this video goes out
10:47 - everywhere this is your boy cozzy
10:49 - i love your beautiful face and i'll see
10:51 - you in the next
10:52 - video go click that video while i juggle
10:55 - these lemons
10:57 - i freaked out at the end because i
10:59 - realized i had a cup of coffee right
11:01 - here
11:02 - if it splashed onto it it would destroy
11:04 - my entire studio while you're still here
11:06 - go watch the other video i love your
11:07 - beautiful face i'll see
11:16 - [Music]
11:21 - you

Cleaned transcript:

i was watching a frontend developer react to css code so i thought hey how about as a full stack developer i react to some awesome javascript code pens so i came across this kevin powell video and he is talking about css and he's taking a look at some mindblowing stuff that inspired me and i was like hey how about we take a look at some incredible javascript projects that are done mostly with javascript and we just take a look at them and maybe have a mindblowing experience together so let's jump right into it so here we have a connect 4 game and it's built using mostly javascript so if you take a look here there's a lot going on in this game tons of it if i went through every single line of this that would take one time but taking a look at this we have a couple of things happening here like if i am looking at this game like look at this right first of all so much is happening whichever column i'm on top of that circle shows up right there and that column gets highlighted that's incredible right and let me click and then it drops so there's a lot of like animation stuff going on here so we'll take a look at the styling for this as well the html seems to be quite simple it's very very basic here just about 70 to 80 lines of html code not much going on on the html side there's quite a lot going on on the css side as well about 200 lines happening here and i believe these keyframes are what are making that animation happen when i click so for example let's comment uh let's take those out to read only how can i edit this let's fork it okay i forked it start again and let's see if we can comment it out beautiful so now it's commented out when i click it it doesn't really know how to behave if i comment all of that out that's adding the bounce actually let's try that again boom so the bounce is happening with these uh with these animations here so let's see if we can add the bounce back in now boom that bounces there that's really nice how we have the bounce happening here hover pointer okay let's take a look now at the javascript side i think that's the side that's um i mean both sides are really interesting here but i also want to take a look at the javascript side quite a bit so on this side we also have a worker here and that worker has our game logic all inside of this so our index.js is making sure it's grabbing our worker and then based off of that it's going so the logic is also important and then how we're able to do all of this stuff happening on the dom that's we're also doing that with javascript as well okay so i'm curious let's see how the row is being column is being highlighted so we have this function called create cursor chip wherever we pass at the index that's where the cursor gets created so for example if i hover over here that chip gets created right on top of this also right on top of this column that's this function create cursor chip so let's find that create cursor chip takes in which player so if it's player two it's gonna be purple if it's player one it's gonna be that turquoise color green color pretty freaking cool project heavy heavy on javascript and logic a lot of fun definitely give yourself a chance to work on something like this but of course there's a lot of css going on in here as well just even this one function here create cursor chip a lot of css being able to retain all this memory then draw those circles then make sure those circles are actually being appended onto every other thing here so really awesome project i love it had ton of fun taking a look at it and now let's take a look at another javascript project so this one is called the terrible cloth the physics of this project is just completely out of this world and that's what kind of blew me away and i was like yo what is happening here but check this out as i hover over it oh like look at how that moves let me refresh and go through it slowly absolutely beautiful i click and i hold and if i right click it cuts like this is just a thing of beauty now i'm not saying as a javascript developer this is what you're going to be doing you have to be a physician to almost make this happen there's a lot of physics going on here so if i could like zoom out here the code a little bit so you can see it but there's tons of physics going on here and the accuracy of the physics house influence gravity jesus i mean space wise spacing tier distance so yeah that type of stuff there's a lot of canvas drawing here and yes tons of physics stuff that i see like i remember even when i was building a game called pong i had to actually apply a lot of physics that i learned in high school that was a lot of fun to make and i made the game with python i remember and it required tons of physics it was cool because i got to take physics that i learned in school and apply it to a actual coding thing and it did real stuff this project freaking awesome heavy on javascript and just the way everything like how bouncy it is right even when i play fifa there's tons of physics in there so when developers are working on things like that in games they really have to go out of their way i mean it's as satisfying to you as it is to me like wow look at that that's just unbelievable unbelievable look at that okay let's go to the next one this is a javascript calculator probably one of the sexiest calculator i've seen to date makes you want to use the calculator to be honest the only thing i wish that this app had is i wish it worked with me typing in my buttons on keyboard it doesn't work with that so here if i do 8 plus 8 equals 16. i really like when i type in 8 or 7 i like when i type in my numbers it has that like little zoom zoom in effect where the number becomes bigger on the screen and the whole thing just has a very clean look like i even like how there's a little delay as i hover over that c or that seven or that eight gives it a nice little touch and even when i do plus right it has those words coming up like divided by plus minus times you you broke it i love that that's funny taking a look at the code here again the html part of it looks really simple this is class num each number our operators have we have a plus operator here class is ops so all the operators i believe are in our ops class so it has a slightly different styling i think it's because what happens here you need access to all of that stuff so you can actually show it happening there i'm curious i really want to know that eight that eight right how does that become big how does that expand so i'm gonna actually check that out okay so i like the comments here too set num so this is how the number is set which is basically like hey i get the number but when i click eight here this is what sets the number so this is when the number is click get the current number selected so okay i understand how we're getting the current number get attribute data num okay so whatever i'm typing in there is being gotten display the current number so i believe that's maybe there wow i love that so if you do eight divided by zero it goes you broke the universe or it goes uh look at what you've done and it

example whatever content i have that's in our data num that is what i believe ends up showing right here so this one really freaking beautiful the front end is awesome love this project really good project and oh by the way i'm i just typed in javascript at the top on codepen and we're just checking out some of the projects there so you could do that too and then look at projects that have javascript in there okay so let's take a look at something else that's interesting so we looked at three projects that's so far that were pretty freaking cool all right so here's another one and i really like this project actually this is really fun we have our chat built here and i can basically send a message so i can be like hey what is going on and if i send this message i get a reply back beautiful all of this is happening without any back end this is just with front end and what's happening is we have our javascript code right here and our javascript code basically we have an array of random messages those random messages are coming out right why did the web developer leave the restaurant because of the table layout and that's this joke right here and that's just being randomly displayed that's good so far and then the rest of it is heavy on css there's a lot of styling going on here right so you have to know how to be able to make a layout like this using html css you can use frameworks you could use grid for this or you could use flexbox and to know okay how are we getting a chat box that looks like this and now my front end skills are not the best as you guys have seen some of my videos right my back and skills are probably a lot better than my front end skills but all of this is happening front end we're sending a message and then we have piece of javascript that essentially waits and then you know i assume it's this set timeout and then we append that to the list of the messages and then we boom send that message but it's fancy because of even how we get the message right when vincent responds it's in green it's on the left hand side it has a timestamp right and what's cool is that it's also pulling the current timestamp timestamp is also styled that's freaking cool it's every response we get it about one and a half second later i believe that's what that 1500 right there probably means we're able to scroll this thing that's also really cool and all of this is pure pure javascript and css so not even libraries or anything like that being used so beautiful project really really awesome i really like it how we have this showing up here we can search oh crap the search works yo what that's awesome i don't even think they're using a react here i don't think so can you react here let's look nope we're just using font awesome well that's
