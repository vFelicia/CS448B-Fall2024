00:00 - hey guys welcome back to the learn
00:02 - sequel course this is part 2 so we are
00:06 - going to jump and roll let's go if you
00:11 - haven't seen the last video which was
00:12 - the first video I go over why sequel is
00:16 - important and how it can be helpful so
00:18 - go check that out some things I didn't
00:20 - mention is you know even Instagram all
00:22 - how all the posts and pictures come up
00:24 - that's equal of Facebook how all posts
00:27 - come up and how they look and everything
00:30 - that's like sequel as well okay so
00:32 - there's PHP and then they're using
00:34 - sequel to kind of sort everything the
00:37 - right way so I just want to give you
00:38 - guys some more ideas of where you'll see
00:42 - it in your daily life blog post websites
00:44 - yeah so keep that in mind alright cool
00:48 - so find the movie with the row ID of six
00:52 - so basically what we need to do is find
00:54 - the title of the movie with the row ID
00:56 - of six so the incredibles should be the
01:00 - only thing we see nothing else okay how
01:03 - do we do that well they have some notes
01:05 - here for us and they're talked about
01:08 - operators and they say equal sign and
01:10 - blah blah Kol name does not equal four
01:13 - this sign means does not equal if you
01:15 - took my Python course you already know
01:18 - that okay so maybe we can say select
01:22 - everything from movies but we don't want
01:24 - to select everything we just want titles
01:26 - so let's start off with that
01:28 - select title from movies and now we get
01:31 - into conditionals conditionals start
01:33 - with okay we're okay wher e there you go
01:39 - queries with constraints okay so
01:43 - constraints so here is that we're okay
01:48 - select title from movies and generally I
01:50 - like to break each of these up into
01:52 - different ones where ID is equal to six
01:59 - how do I remember this we'll check it
02:01 - out select star from movie right
02:06 - remember ID is six so I can identify
02:11 - this title by the ID
02:13 - or by the bird or the director or the
02:18 - year or the lengths minutes however if I
02:21 - picked length minutes what if some other
02:24 - movie is also 116 minutes so maybe
02:26 - you'll see the Incredibles in some other
02:27 - movie
02:28 - what if Brad Bird directed multiple
02:30 - movies which he did rat ratatouille and
02:32 - Incredibles so if I filtered on director
02:36 - then maybe I would get the Incredibles
02:38 - and ratatouille and same thing with year
02:41 - the most unique thing I see here is ID
02:44 - and that's 99.999999% of the times
02:48 - couldn't be the most unique thing when
02:51 - you are on twitter and you create an
02:53 - account what they generally do is they
02:57 - don't make your username unique or make
03:00 - it an ID they make your ID and ID and
03:03 - then you sequel that way because I'm not
03:08 - sure if you can change yeah you can
03:10 - change your username on Twitter right so
03:13 - that wouldn't be unique enough because
03:18 - the hundred hearts you got on your tweet
03:21 - and if you change your name to somebody
03:22 - else now you can have somebody else's
03:25 - heart I may be wrong on the unique name
03:29 - part on Twitter because I'm thinking
03:30 - about it now and the tweet ad signed
03:33 - like let's you kind of have a unique
03:34 - name but I do remember that I used to
03:37 - have some other name and now I have
03:39 - clever Kazi so I got I got to change
03:42 - mine okay so on the back end there you
03:46 - most unique thing is not being by user
03:48 - name they have something called ID and
03:50 - their IDs might not look like one or two
03:52 - it might look like seven six capital a
03:55 - small C asterisks with some crazy big
03:57 - thing but that's the unique identifier
04:01 - of clever Kazi all of clever Cosby's
04:05 - posts okay so it might actually
04:06 - literally be a table might be clever
04:09 - Kazi oz posts and it might have one
04:12 - column like you know have like a lot of
04:14 - my posts then they'll say something else
04:16 - like likes or whatever and that's how it
04:19 - goes okay so here the most unique thing
04:22 - is the column of ID so what I'm going to
04:24 - do is select
04:27 - title and see if you can do it with me
04:29 - because we just did it what's the next
04:31 - part from movies what's the next part I
04:36 - got to get specific so we talked about
04:39 - where get into conditionals ID is equal
04:42 - to six boom incredible done now they
04:46 - want us to move to the second part but
04:48 - notice we can't really see anything in
04:49 - the table so what I like to do is go
04:51 - back how do we revert back and see
04:53 - everything key word everything select
04:58 - how do you see everything asterisk or
05:01 - star from movies and the case
05:05 - sensitivity doesn't matter you could say
05:06 - it like however you want okay so now we
05:12 - see everything you can also just hit
05:14 - reset here that's a good way to do it as
05:16 - well but don't get used to that
05:18 - because I want you to get used to
05:19 - writing it yourself so you understand
05:22 - how it's working every time find the
05:25 - movie's release between year 2000 2010
05:28 - okay how do we do that
05:30 - select the column we're talking about is
05:33 - movies or title from movies where the
05:43 - years are between 2000 and 2010 so if I
05:46 - just reset this we're going to be this
05:50 - is the title we want to show or this is
05:53 - the column we want to show so in select
05:57 - we're going to have this call on the
06:00 - title name at the end of the day we're
06:02 - selecting it from the movie table so
06:05 - that part is also correct and the part
06:08 - that we want to filter it by is the year
06:10 - column so when we write where we're
06:13 - going to talk about year in there and we
06:15 - want to look between 2000 and 2010
06:18 - programmatically we can do something
06:20 - like 2000 um you know like year less
06:26 - than 2000 and year greater than or sorry
06:32 - the other way greater than or equal to
06:35 - 2000 and year less than 2010
06:39 - and this little guy is going to give you
06:42 - sandwiched between the year 2000 and the
06:45 - year between 2010 but sequel allows you
06:48 - to do this in a much cleaner way which
06:50 - is just saying I think we're a year
06:55 - between 2000 let me go look at their
07:02 - thing really quickly between 1 and 5 and
07:05 - blah blah up so I was going to write it
07:06 - correctly between 2000 and 2010 and the
07:10 - last part is where okay so we're a year
07:14 - between 2000 and 2010 so we completed
07:18 - the second task beautiful okay so it
07:23 - gave us all those movies and if you see
07:25 - the year's Monsters Inc 2001 Toy Story 3
07:29 - 2010 to the 9 7 8 7 6 and it's giving
07:33 - you nothing else that's exactly what you
07:36 - want it right one thing I'm thinking
07:40 - about making is for everybody who's on
07:42 - clever programmer comma when I'm create
07:44 - an app where I give you guys points for
07:46 - being on clever programmer calm more so
07:50 - maybe I'm going to have a leaderboard
07:52 - and based on your guys's web sessions
07:55 - that you guys have on my website I'm
07:57 - going to Kure it and then or query it
08:01 - sorry just is where I speak English and
08:04 - then the top most active person is going
08:07 - to be the top the least active is going
08:08 - to be at the bottom and maybe based on
08:10 - that I'll send out an email or be like
08:12 - hey you're the first person so I'm going
08:14 - to give you a free coaching lesson or
08:16 - maybe I'll just get on a call with you
08:18 - and talking and just ask you what were
08:20 - the coolest things you think are at the
08:22 - clever program or how could we improve
08:23 - them so I'm also giving you some ideas
08:27 - on fun how you could use it for fun
08:30 - things like an app but then it's also
08:32 - business-related because it's helping me
08:34 - identify and talk to people who are
08:37 - actually the most active so I'll get
08:40 - back really good feedback so then I can
08:42 - make my courses the best ok all right um
08:47 - fine movies not released in the year
08:50 - between 2002
08:52 - and ten okay for those of you guys who
08:56 - have taken my Python programming courses
08:58 - you'll know that you just have to say
09:00 - something like not somewhere so that's
09:02 - really it we're not year between 2010
09:05 - I'm not really get going to get too much
09:07 - into conditionals but seriously guys if
09:10 - you're jumping into sequel right away
09:12 - yeah that's okay but if you really want
09:17 - to learn things the right way I know
09:19 - you're short on time but trust me
09:21 - half-assed learning things will end up
09:24 - taking you three times the time it would
09:27 - take you to just learn things in the
09:29 - right order okay so I'm saving you time
09:31 - even if you're at work and you're doing
09:33 - a job and you need it okay learn a
09:36 - little bit of Python at least get up to
09:38 - the if conditions which should take you
09:39 - less than a few hours to be honest and
09:41 - then jump here because there's a lot of
09:44 - there's a lot of conditional stuff going
09:46 - on here okay so why are using end
09:49 - instead of or what logical specific
09:52 - logical meaning that has you need to
09:54 - understand how that works okay like
09:56 - deeply understand it and then how this
09:59 - whole thing you just negate it by
10:00 - putting a nut okay so these are just
10:02 - some examples but sort of just googling
10:05 - and memorizing understand them and then
10:08 - you'll have a framework to apply to any
10:09 - situation okay for how do you think
10:12 - we're going to do that find the first
10:14 - five Pixar movies and their release here
10:17 - before I do it or I brainstorm a way to
10:21 - come up with a solution every time about
10:23 - to do a task do it perform me pause
10:25 - pause this video do it of right now okay
10:29 - once you fail miserably
10:31 - if you don't brilliant keep moving but
10:35 - if you fail spectacularly that's fine
10:39 - that's fine
10:40 - I want your brains hurt a little bit
10:41 - because that's the only way to expand
10:43 - and become better so if you fail please
10:46 - don't worry
10:47 - and I'm right here I'm going to try to
10:50 - I'm going to walk you through it but if
10:51 - you can try to do yourself that's the
10:54 - best way to start learning okay be
10:56 - active about it so now I'm going to
10:58 - start going ahead and taking a shot at
11:00 - it from scratch first thing I want to do
11:02 - is see everything so let's start from
11:04 - movies
11:05 - just that's automatic at this point okay
11:09 - so now I'm looking at this data and how
11:11 - do I pick the first five movies and
11:14 - their release here so all right first
11:20 - five movies I mean based on what I'm
11:23 - looking at
11:24 - Finding Nemo monsters Toy Story 2 bug's
11:26 - life to end of this Toy Story looks like
11:30 - the first 5 movies even if you look at
11:32 - the years it look like the first 5
11:34 - movies so one filter that makes sense to
11:36 - me is see if you can figure out what
11:39 - that would be but a year less than 2004
11:44 - I think those are the first 5 movies
11:46 - right so that's the pattern I'm going to
11:48 - think about so 2003 to 199 998 and those
11:54 - are the first side moves so ok we're and
11:59 - first 5 Pixar movies so the column we
12:02 - want is actually the title name where am
12:04 - I going to put that in here or in here
12:08 - I'm going to put that in select ok and
12:11 - the where part is the condition and
12:14 - since I'm using year that's going to go
12:16 - into we're part okay so rare part is the
12:19 - filter so I'm going to say where year is
12:22 - less than 2004 okay and the continue
12:29 - button is unlocked and we have defeated
12:31 - we have mastered this challenge awesome
12:35 - ok I'm super excited because as we keep
12:38 - going through this you guys are going to
12:40 - see the amazing beautiful and powerful
12:43 - things that allows you to do and I can't
12:46 - wait to get to the part where we start
12:47 - building our Python app where you're
12:49 - actually using sequel throughout it ok
12:51 - it's going to be exciting stuff guys so
12:54 - without further ado let's jump into the
12:57 - next video and I can't wait to see you
12:59 - there

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome back to the learn sequel course this is part 2 so we are going to jump and roll let's go if you haven't seen the last video which was the first video I go over why sequel is important and how it can be helpful so go check that out some things I didn't mention is you know even Instagram all how all the posts and pictures come up that's equal of Facebook how all posts come up and how they look and everything that's like sequel as well okay so there's PHP and then they're using sequel to kind of sort everything the right way so I just want to give you guys some more ideas of where you'll see it in your daily life blog post websites yeah so keep that in mind alright cool so find the movie with the row ID of six so basically what we need to do is find the title of the movie with the row ID of six so the incredibles should be the only thing we see nothing else okay how do we do that well they have some notes here for us and they're talked about operators and they say equal sign and blah blah Kol name does not equal four this sign means does not equal if you took my Python course you already know that okay so maybe we can say select everything from movies but we don't want to select everything we just want titles so let's start off with that select title from movies and now we get into conditionals conditionals start with okay we're okay wher e there you go queries with constraints okay so constraints so here is that we're okay select title from movies and generally I like to break each of these up into different ones where ID is equal to six how do I remember this we'll check it out select star from movie right remember ID is six so I can identify this title by the ID or by the bird or the director or the year or the lengths minutes however if I picked length minutes what if some other movie is also 116 minutes so maybe you'll see the Incredibles in some other movie what if Brad Bird directed multiple movies which he did rat ratatouille and Incredibles so if I filtered on director then maybe I would get the Incredibles and ratatouille and same thing with year the most unique thing I see here is ID and that's 99.999999% of the times couldn't be the most unique thing when you are on twitter and you create an account what they generally do is they don't make your username unique or make it an ID they make your ID and ID and then you sequel that way because I'm not sure if you can change yeah you can change your username on Twitter right so that wouldn't be unique enough because the hundred hearts you got on your tweet and if you change your name to somebody else now you can have somebody else's heart I may be wrong on the unique name part on Twitter because I'm thinking about it now and the tweet ad signed like let's you kind of have a unique name but I do remember that I used to have some other name and now I have clever Kazi so I got I got to change mine okay so on the back end there you most unique thing is not being by user name they have something called ID and their IDs might not look like one or two it might look like seven six capital a small C asterisks with some crazy big thing but that's the unique identifier of clever Kazi all of clever Cosby's posts okay so it might actually literally be a table might be clever Kazi oz posts and it might have one column like you know have like a lot of my posts then they'll say something else like likes or whatever and that's how it goes okay so here the most unique thing is the column of ID so what I'm going to do is select title and see if you can do it with me because we just did it what's the next part from movies what's the next part I got to get specific so we talked about where get into conditionals ID is equal to six boom incredible done now they want us to move to the second part but notice we can't really see anything in the table so what I like to do is go back how do we revert back and see everything key word everything select how do you see everything asterisk or star from movies and the case sensitivity doesn't matter you could say it like however you want okay so now we see everything you can also just hit reset here that's a good way to do it as well but don't get used to that because I want you to get used to writing it yourself so you understand how it's working every time find the movie's release between year 2000 2010 okay how do we do that select the column we're talking about is movies or title from movies where the years are between 2000 and 2010 so if I just reset this we're going to be this is the title we want to show or this is the column we want to show so in select we're going to have this call on the title name at the end of the day we're selecting it from the movie table so that part is also correct and the part that we want to filter it by is the year column so when we write where we're going to talk about year in there and we want to look between 2000 and 2010 programmatically we can do something like 2000 um you know like year less than 2000 and year greater than or sorry the other way greater than or equal to 2000 and year less than 2010 and this little guy is going to give you

second task beautiful okay so it gave us all those movies and if you see the year's Monsters Inc 2001 Toy Story 3 2010 to the 9 7 8 7 6 and it's giving you nothing else that's exactly what you want it right one thing I'm thinking about making is for everybody who's on clever programmer comma when I'm create an app where I give you guys points for being on clever programmer calm more so maybe I'm

coaching lesson or maybe I'll just get on a call with you and talking and just ask you what were the coolest things you think are at the clever program or how could we improve them so I'm also giving you some ideas on fun how you could use it for fun things like an app but then it's also businessrelated because it's helping me identify and talk to people who are actually the most active so I'll get back really good feedback so then I can make my courses the best ok all right um fine movies not released in the year between 2002 and ten okay for those of you guys who have taken my Python programming courses you'll know that you just have to say something like not somewhere so that's really it we're not year between 2010 I'm not really get going to get too much into conditionals but seriously guys if you're jumping into sequel right away yeah that's okay but if you really want to learn things the right way I know you're short on time but trust me halfassed learning things will end up taking you three times the time it would take you to just learn things in the right order okay so I'm saving you time even if you're at work and you're doing a job and you need it okay learn a little bit of Python at least get up to the if conditions which should take you less than a few hours to be honest and then jump here because there's a lot of there's a lot of conditional stuff going on here okay so why are using end instead of or what logical specific logical meaning that has you need to understand how that works okay like deeply understand it and then how this whole thing you just negate it by putting a nut okay so these are just some examples but sort of just googling and memorizing understand them and then you'll have a framework to apply to any situation okay for how do you think we're going to do that find the first five Pixar movies and their release here before I do it or I brainstorm a way to come up with a solution every time about to do a task do it perform me pause pause this video do it of right now okay once you fail miserably if you don't brilliant keep moving but if you fail spectacularly that's fine that's fine I want your brains hurt a little bit because that's the only way to expand and become better so if you fail please don't worry and I'm right here I'm going to try to I'm going to walk you through it but if you can try to do yourself that's the best way to start learning okay be active about it so now I'm going to start going ahead and taking a shot at it from scratch first thing I want to do is see everything so let's start from
