00:00 - top 5 highest tank programming jobs and
00:02 - in this video every single programming
00:04 - job I'm going to tell you is going to go
00:06 - from low to high paying jobs now wait
00:09 - till we get to the last one because it
00:10 - gets absolutely crazy I'm gonna be
00:12 - talking to you about the average salary
00:14 - you'll be making with these job roles
00:16 - the time it will take you to become a
00:18 - developer with these job roles what your
00:19 - role would actually look like what will
00:21 - you be doing day to day and the last one
00:23 - is the absolute craziest one so I can't
00:25 - wait for you to find out let's go number
00:27 - five full stack developer who would
00:29 - likely be using a language like
00:31 - JavaScript here or maybe if you're using
00:33 - python you'll be using Frameworks like
00:35 - Django or Flash but essentially you'll
00:37 - be developing web applications so
00:39 - imagine you're one of the full stack
00:41 - developers at YouTube and YouTube tells
00:43 - you hey you need to build a new feature
00:45 - like the like button make sure to hit
00:47 - the like button or add in a new feature
00:49 - and the ability to delete comments or
00:51 - filter comments or publish a video when
00:53 - I hit the public button or unlist a
00:55 - video when I hit that button all of that
00:57 - functionality is something that somebody
00:58 - who's a full stack developer would build
01:00 - other things that might be included in a
01:02 - full stack developer is full stack
01:03 - developers made up of a front-end
01:04 - developer and a back-end developer's
01:06 - front-end developer might make a web app
01:08 - look nice and beautiful so for example
01:10 - when I hit the like button what color
01:12 - does it turn and how does it turn white
01:13 - and when I unlike a video it turns back
01:16 - to Gray and I've already watched the
01:17 - video there should be a red bar at the
01:19 - bottom showing me that I've already seen
01:21 - a bunch of it all of that is something
01:22 - that a front-end developer would do and
01:24 - now a back-end developer would be
01:27 - somebody who's doing where the data is
01:28 - being stored so if we have millions and
01:31 - millions and millions of videos how are
01:33 - they being stored how are we reading
01:35 - those videos and then displaying that
01:36 - data over on YouTube that's the job of a
01:39 - back-end developer so if you combine
01:41 - both of those skills the front end and
01:43 - back end you get a full stack developer
01:44 - and that's what your role might look
01:46 - like when it comes to your day-to-day
01:47 - job now the time for you to get a first
01:50 - job would vary I made a short on this
01:52 - and I got roasted pretty hard from the
01:54 - comments you can't get a job in three to
01:56 - six months that's impossible keep crying
01:58 - me a river crying these comments below
02:00 - as well that's totally fine I myself got
02:02 - a job within the first three to six
02:03 - months I worked my butt off and I worked
02:05 - tremendously hard and I was coding for
02:07 - 10 to 12 to 15 hours every single day
02:10 - assessing and using that I was able to
02:12 - get my job fairly quickly there are a
02:14 - lot of people who have gone to coding
02:15 - boot camps and have come out and gotten
02:17 - jobs there's tons of stories one person
02:19 - met me recently he met me at vid Summit
02:22 - this year he said he went from being
02:23 - homeless to getting a job at Google
02:26 - within four months all he did was watch
02:28 - my YouTube videos online but for most
02:30 - people the time can take one to two
02:32 - years and I'm not saying you're an
02:34 - amazing full stack developer because
02:35 - people will take me out of context and
02:37 - say I'm saying you become an amazing
02:39 - developer no you could get your first
02:40 - entry-level job you could get your
02:42 - internship as a full stack developer
02:44 - making 50 60 70 000 a year okay so this
02:48 - is something that's definitely possible
02:49 - and it's in my opinion the best path to
02:52 - get into the field of programming the
02:54 - average salary full stack developer is
02:57 - around 102 to 219 000 dollars per year
03:01 - according to depending on if you're
03:02 - looking at ZipRecruiter or indeed.com
03:04 - number four a cloud engineer Your Role
03:07 - here would be to help companies scale
03:10 - using Cloud Technologies like AWS or
03:12 - bigquery and imagine you're working at
03:15 - Netflix and you're assigned the job to
03:17 - help scale their web app to millions of
03:20 - users online using some kind of cloud
03:21 - technology you would be in charge of
03:23 - that you'd be figuring out how to make
03:25 - that happen managing cloud and the cloud
03:27 - infrastructure is something that would
03:29 - be part of your role and anytime if you
03:31 - go to a website or you go to slack and
03:33 - it'll say something like 99.99 uptime as
03:36 - a cloud engineer you'll be in charge of
03:38 - things like uptime and making sure web
03:40 - app or the application is running 24 7
03:43 - or as close to 24 7 as possible that's
03:46 - going to be your primary role the time
03:48 - it takes to get your first job and
03:49 - something like becoming a cloud engineer
03:51 - it is a little bit harder and requires
03:53 - more devops knowledge things like
03:55 - that'll take you about a year plus to
03:57 - get your first job as a cloud engineer
04:00 - and the average salary of a cloud
04:02 - engineer is 120 000 a year now this is
04:05 - pretty cool the cloud engineer makes 120
04:08 - 000 but the one I'm gonna tell you next
04:09 - those engineers make more and by the end
04:11 - of this video those people are making
04:13 - ridiculous amount of money so I hope
04:15 - you're excited let's get to it number
04:17 - three a mobile developer this is where
04:19 - you're building iOS applications or
04:21 - Android applications and think that your
04:23 - apps are in app stores Google App Stores
04:25 - or iPhone app stores and thousands of
04:28 - people or maybe even millions of people
04:29 - might be using apps that you make they
04:31 - could be developing game apps you could
04:33 - be developing productivity apps like
04:35 - notion you could be working at a company
04:37 - like notion and building their
04:38 - application and then millions of users
04:40 - use their mobile application whether
04:41 - it's on their iMac or their iPad or
04:43 - their MacBooks or iPhones or wherever
04:46 - else this is something that takes a
04:47 - while to learn so I would say that first
04:49 - job might take you around eight months
04:51 - or a little bit longer to land the
04:53 - average salary of a mobile developer is
04:55 - around 130 thousand dollars per year and
04:58 - overall if mobile excites you the world
05:00 - of mobile and its future and how mobile
05:03 - is growing so fast and how the whole
05:04 - world is moving to mobile devices and
05:06 - this is definitely something you want to
05:08 - look into and pursue number two data
05:11 - scientists now this is one of the
05:12 - coolest types of jobs in my opinion you
05:14 - can have because you're doing things
05:16 - like developing algorithms for YouTube
05:17 - to recommend you your next video or the
05:20 - algorithms for an Amazon store to
05:22 - recommend you your next product or
05:24 - you're analyzing how a customer for a
05:27 - company's churning and you can help that
05:29 - company be able to implement steps to
05:31 - retain their customer using this you can
05:33 - actually predict people's behaviors and
05:36 - actually have a huge impact on people's
05:38 - behavior same reason why people got
05:40 - hooked to tick tock how Tick Tock just
05:42 - keeps knowing what to serve you next now
05:44 - it's an application being used by
05:45 - billions of users you can help companies
05:47 - like Amazon or UPS develop algorithms to
05:51 - optimize routes for delivery or
05:52 - transportation and you can reduce your
05:54 - costs and improve efficiency and saved
05:56 - them hundreds of millions of dollars so
05:58 - clearly the value that you bring as a
06:00 - data scientist is absolutely massive
06:03 - however I think to get your first job
06:05 - even as an intern even if you worked
06:07 - really really hard I believe would be
06:09 - around one to two years because it is
06:11 - something that is much more technically
06:13 - complex and the other roles that I had
06:15 - mentioned oftentimes people need degrees
06:17 - or mathematical background or just a
06:20 - propensity for numbers to be able to
06:22 - succeed in this field the average salary
06:24 - is about a hundred and forty thousand
06:27 - dollars a year and what's crazy about
06:29 - this role is the range can go and be
06:31 - absolutely massive you could have a data
06:34 - scientist who's a Quant who works for
06:35 - maybe a financial firm predicting stocks
06:38 - and doing trading algorithms and they
06:39 - could be making as much as half a
06:41 - million dollars working at companies
06:42 - like Wall Street so the range for a data
06:44 - scientist is huge and number one a chief
06:48 - technology officer or a CTO this is
06:51 - somebody who if you become a CTO you
06:54 - will be managing all other developers or
06:56 - data scientists or Cloud Engineers
06:58 - everybody I previously mentioned
07:00 - underneath you the time it takes to
07:02 - become a chief technology officer is a
07:04 - lot average time it takes is about 10
07:06 - years because you do need a ton of
07:08 - experience and have built many many
07:10 - applications so that when you're about
07:12 - to manage teams you're already somebody
07:14 - who knows how to perform at a high level
07:16 - therefore you could manage a big team
07:17 - underneath you the median salary
07:19 - according to salary.com of a CTO is
07:23 - around 274 000 a year and I've heard
07:26 - some crazy stories from people within
07:28 - the field who can go up to making half a
07:30 - million dollars to even a million
07:32 - dollars and a bunch of ctOS oftentimes
07:35 - even get to a position where they can
07:36 - get equity in a company especially if
07:38 - it's a startup and get hired by these
07:40 - big companies so being a CTO is a really
07:43 - really really valuable role and a
07:45 - million dollars is not out of the
07:47 - question depending on what company hires
07:49 - you and what value you could bring to
07:50 - them and one note that I do want to
07:52 - leave that's worth noting is all of this
07:53 - depends on where you live where you get
07:56 - your job your individual level of skill
07:58 - your ambition your negotiation skills
08:00 - there's a ton of factors so I'm just
08:02 - trying to make this video something
08:03 - that's valuable for you and entertaining
08:06 - but definitely all of this can vary a
08:08 - lot with that said what I would
08:09 - recommend to you if you want to get
08:11 - started in this field I would recommend
08:14 - to start with becoming a full stack
08:16 - developer because I think it's the
08:17 - easiest way to break into this field and
08:20 - if that is something you want to pursue
08:22 - and you would want me or my team's help
08:24 - but I would highly recommend is we have
08:26 - an amazing program that we've built and
08:28 - you can get coached by me and my team
08:30 - it's a very intensive program where you
08:32 - and I will work together rigorously
08:34 - teach you the skills build up your
08:35 - GitHub build up your projects put them
08:37 - on your portfolio help you master the
08:39 - basics of becoming a full stack
08:41 - developer will be able to help you do
08:43 - all of that in a short amount of time
08:44 - we've helped tons of students take
08:46 - students like Ali who's never worked in
08:48 - the industry before to now getting a job
08:49 - as a software developer making ninety
08:51 - thousand dollars a year or take David
08:52 - Daley who went from being homeless to
08:54 - becoming a developer at Google within
08:56 - four months of learning from us and I'm
08:58 - also going to do a podcast on my Channel
09:00 - with him that you'll get to see at some
09:01 - point so if you want to get results like
09:03 - that and that excites you click the link
09:05 - in the description below apply for
09:07 - coaching program of becoming a full
09:09 - stack developer a team and I will

09:12 - that call we're going to discuss your
09:14 - goals and plans and we're going to bring

top 5 highest tank programming jobs and in this video every single programming job I'm going to tell you is going to go from low to high paying jobs now wait till we get to the last one because it gets absolutely crazy I'm gonna be talking to you about the average salary you'll be making with these job roles the time it will take you to become a developer with these job roles what your role would actually look like what will you be doing day to day and the last one is the absolute craziest one so I can't wait for you to find out let's go number five full stack developer who would likely
