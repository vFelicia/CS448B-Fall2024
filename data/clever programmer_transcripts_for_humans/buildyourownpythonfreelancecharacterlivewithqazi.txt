00:41 - development framework for Python okay
00:45 - what do those frameworks the developers
00:49 - who develop in those frameworks what did
00:51 - they get paid on average and we're gonna
00:55 - be talking about the best code editor
00:58 - for Python alrighty and I'm also gonna
01:04 - be looking at your guys's comments and
01:06 - checking them out do you for them yeah
01:12 - buddy

03:07 - they can't even hear me and in this
03:12 - video we're also gonna be talking about
03:13 - how you can build your own Python
03:17 - freelance character and take your own
03:20 - skills up as a Python freelancer okay if
03:22 - you want to be a Python developer and
03:24 - work with a company or be a site hustler
03:26 - you're also welcome here I'm just gonna
03:28 - be focusing more on this freelancing
03:30 - part and I'm gonna be kind of talking
03:33 - more about that as well Larry says thank
03:37 - you so much love the portfolio guys the
03:39 - second video is out make sure in the
03:43 - description it lets them maybe know that
03:45 - a little bit but guys the second video
03:47 - the part two of the master class is live
03:51 - okay this master class is what shows you
03:54 - how you can become a Python developer in
03:57 - less than 90 days and get that first
04:00 - paycheck this master class is absolutely
04:03 - free and in the first master class we
04:07 - covered a lot of things like soft skills
04:09 - we covered just overall lots of things
04:13 - like for example your Python earning
04:15 - potential how much you could be looking
04:18 - to make okay so if you haven't watched
04:22 - the
04:22 - first one go watch it it's absolutely
04:25 - free and it's in the links in the
04:26 - descriptions below so go enjoy that and
04:30 - I have some other stuff for you guys let
04:32 - me just pull up some of my notes coolly
04:37 - okay make this half on this screen but a
04:42 - BAM bada boom well what did I press
04:47 - being a programmer and all I should
04:50 - really learn how to use my computer this
04:56 - goes here and this goes here and we are
04:59 - golden okay for people who are having
05:05 - trouble opening up the portfolio guys
05:10 - it's just like like literally you know I
05:13 - made it so you can double-click and open
05:15 - it or you can just go on and open a new
05:17 - file in Chrome if you're still having
05:18 - trouble google how to open an HTML file
05:23 - that's it just Google how to open an
05:26 - index.html file
05:28 - and Google will give you all your
05:29 - answers okay because in the second video
05:32 - we go over all of that okay so in the
05:36 - second video that got launched today I
05:38 - show you the number one secret to how
05:40 - you can become that developer in less
05:41 - than 90 days okay this is if you don't
05:43 - have degree you don't have money you
05:45 - don't have time and you don't have
05:47 - technical skills it works for all of you
05:49 - guys I also go over how I went from
05:52 - being a 2.0 GPA student and making
05:56 - $100,000 in one year and I kind of give
05:58 - you guys that as well
06:00 - okay so I give you how I did that while
06:04 - being a bad student so some of you guys
06:07 - can relate with that and it would help
06:09 - you knowing that you don't need to be
06:10 - smart enough and see that practical path
06:12 - that's also in there yeah we're gonna do
06:17 - the Q&A for a little bit but yet so the
06:19 - where this live stream where the idea
06:21 - kind of got conceptualized in my mind
06:23 - for this live stream which is I say
06:26 - build your Python freelance character is
06:29 - I remember when I was younger and I
06:31 - would play video games like Sims or like
06:35 - Skyrim
06:36 - or I used to play this one game called
06:37 - Dragon Age Origins and what what a lot
06:42 - of these games have in common is you
06:44 - have a character and whatever you do
06:48 - with this character you get these skill
06:49 - points and your guy becomes better and
06:51 - better in those particular skills so for
06:55 - example if you're playing a game like
06:56 - Dragon Age Origins and your guy is
06:59 - focusing on being a mage and he's doing
07:02 - spells or whatever or if your guy is
07:04 - being an archer or a swordsman whatever
07:07 - as you spend more time with those
07:10 - weapons or those things your guy levels
07:13 - up in those skills or take Sims where
07:16 - when your guy spends more time reading
07:18 - books he becomes better at reading more
07:21 - books and also he becomes more
07:23 - knowledgeable so now he can make new
07:25 - foods that he couldn't make before and
07:27 - he can do a lot of things he couldn't do
07:29 - before or for if he spends more time in
07:32 - the gym
07:32 - your characters get those skill points
07:35 - in the gym he starts getting better and
07:36 - then it takes him longer to get hungry
07:38 - and all that and there was a point in my
07:43 - life where I kind of loved games and
07:45 - then what happened to me was I kind of
07:49 - realized that if you spend time on
07:55 - yourself and you build up those skill
08:00 - points just in life it's kind of the
08:04 - same way even though there's no gamma
08:08 - fication happening you know you're the
08:11 - gooey bars are actually not building up
08:12 - and you can't go somewhere you don't get
08:14 - a notification for it right and when you
08:17 - log into life when you wake up you don't
08:19 - get a little notification that goes Boop
08:21 - you got a hundred points for sleeping on
08:24 - time and getting seven and a half hours
08:25 - of sleep you don't get a little
08:27 - notification for going to the gym today
08:29 - you don't get a little notification for
08:31 - being nice to your parents you don't get
08:33 - a notification for it getting your
08:35 - girlfriend a little gift and what starts
08:38 - to happen is when we don't have that
08:41 - instant gratification we look in other
08:43 - places those other places could be video
08:46 - games those other places could be things
08:48 - like drugs and alcohol
08:49 - and those other places could just be you
08:52 - know whatever like places where you're
08:55 - fine like Netflix you're watching
08:58 - stranger things
08:58 - you're watching house of cards you're
09:00 - binging on some anime you just found and
09:04 - that happens to us a lot and that
09:07 - happens to me at times too and as you
09:11 - compare what you're doing in those video
09:13 - games and in those movies and how the
09:16 - drugs and alcohol might make you feel
09:19 - with where you actually are in real life
09:23 - the contrast it kind of it hurts because
09:27 - one thing is so awesome and fun and
09:29 - instant gratification whereas this other
09:32 - thing you're getting farther and farther
09:34 - from your goals every day you're just
09:35 - sitting there like if I just started
09:38 - going to the gym I had that thought like
09:41 - seven years ago and I thought I was too
09:44 - old to go to the gym seven years ago and
09:45 - if I just done it what would I look like
09:48 - right now or you have that thought oh
09:51 - man I knew I could have done that job or
09:53 - started that business and now my friends
09:56 - doing it and look how well he's doing or
09:58 - I should have started a YouTube channel
09:59 - and look where that would have been now
10:01 - or I should have done this for that and
10:03 - look where that would have been now but
10:06 - then BOOM switch let's watch some
10:08 - stranger things baby let's watch some
10:10 - house of cards let's watch some Fargo
10:12 - forget about everything else and we kind
10:18 - of get caught up in that but here's a
10:22 - cool thing if you can if you can get
10:24 - over that instant gratification thing a
10:27 - little bit and not getting those little
10:29 - notifications in life and you start to
10:31 - really focus every day you take 10 to 15
10:34 - minutes analyzing where you are your own
10:37 - life is kind of like being that video
10:41 - game character if you spend more time
10:45 - dealing with tough tough conversations
10:48 - maybe you're at work at whatever your
10:50 - current job is and you go in to ask for
10:52 - that promotion it feels uncomfortable
10:53 - your how it hearts pounding your hands
10:55 - are shaking you're sweating whoo scary
11:00 - right but when you go and do it
11:03 - and you get through it and maybe you get
11:05 - that promotion what just happened
11:08 - your skill points improved in
11:10 - negotiation and now you could use those
11:13 - skill points at other jobs isn't it
11:17 - freaking cool like after you kind of
11:20 - realize that why do you need to play
11:21 - Skyrim you kind of don't what happens
11:24 - when you put some time into going to the
11:26 - gym after a little bit weeks you know a
11:29 - few weeks you'll start to see some
11:31 - results and now you're putting points
11:33 - into your own physical fitness and
11:35 - getting better your character in real
11:37 - life is getting better and guess what
11:40 - when you put that controller away the
11:45 - character doesn't go away it's still
11:46 - there with you forever if the lights go
11:50 - out and the game ends or the hard drive
11:53 - crashes and all your saves are gone it
11:56 - doesn't matter because that character is
11:58 - you and that's there forever
11:59 - that doesn't run out of batteries if you
12:05 - spend time coding like Python for
12:08 - example or whatever language and you're
12:10 - coding you're building your coding
12:12 - skills tree you're becoming a better
12:14 - developer and if you spend time doing
12:18 - this and you're building cool projects
12:19 - it literally feels just like playing a
12:21 - game except you might be making six
12:25 - figures doing it isn't that nice now
12:29 - contrast that with playing video games
12:31 - watching stranger things abusing drugs
12:34 - and alcohol and sitting in your mom's
12:36 - basement versus playing this other game
12:40 - called being a developer web development
12:44 - working on projects I feel literally
12:46 - like a game except it's like a glitch in
12:48 - life and people are paying you money
12:50 - money for it and at the end of the day
12:53 - you have something to show for it and
12:55 - you're doing this from a nice apartment
12:57 - overlooking a lake or something I don't
13:00 - know whatever it is that you like to
13:01 - overlook maybe you could be overlooking
13:03 - dumpsters that's your thing I don't know
13:04 - I don't know that is something that
13:08 - excites me these skills if you work on
13:11 - them on your own in real life when
13:13 - everything else goes to these
13:15 - skills are there with you
13:17 - forever they're there with you to stay
13:20 - there with you and you're getting money
13:22 - as a benefit as a bonus and now you can
13:27 - not only support yourself but your
13:29 - family you also don't have to feel like
13:32 - you're you don't have confidence you
13:34 - also don't have to feel like you have
13:36 - that lack of control in life because
13:40 - doing these things and working on
13:42 - yourself gives you that control in life
13:45 - okay so this is something important to
13:49 - keep in mind as you move forward now
13:55 - what we're gonna do is we're gonna talk
13:58 - a little bit about web development and
14:02 - the differences between different
14:05 - frameworks okay so we're gonna get a
14:07 - little bit technical and we're going to
14:08 - talk about Python again in the meantime
14:11 - I'm going to look at some of your guys's
14:13 - what you guys are saying maybe some
14:15 - comments maybe some questions and kind
14:17 - of answer that
14:45 - no questions so far not too many
14:48 - questions I am looking for some
14:51 - questions that I can ask for you guys or
14:53 - answer for you guys can you make neural
14:55 - network tutorial for beginners using
14:57 - Python yes I will be making I will be
15:00 - doing some stuff with machine learning
15:01 - later on not at this moment in time
15:05 - because I'm focusing more on web
15:07 - development with Python but don't worry
15:09 - this is something that excites the hell
15:11 - out of me so I will be doing some neural
15:13 - network stuff and I'm gonna be bringing
15:15 - on best developers in the world on this
15:18 - channel and they're either gonna be
15:21 - helping me build some kind of awesome
15:24 - curriculum for you guys or literally I'm
15:26 - gonna have them make some videos for you
15:27 - guys too so AI or whatever it is that
15:31 - you guys want to learn not a problem
15:37 - here's what I urge everybody to do right
15:40 - now I'm gonna give you like 20 seconds
15:44 - as I go through these q and A's have a
15:47 - pen paper with you because the things
15:50 - that we're gonna be talking about are
15:51 - extremely valuable you don't want to
15:55 - miss them
15:55 - okay I would share the slides with you
15:58 - but again I'm on three different live
16:00 - platforms so I have to respect that
16:02 - because if I share the slides with
16:04 - everybody on YouTube
16:05 - if Instagram doesn't see that and if I
16:07 - share something on Facebook YouTube and
16:09 - Instagram doesn't see that so I have to
16:10 - respect all that so guys go get a piece
16:13 - of paper pen whatever and write these
16:17 - things down because they're gonna be
16:18 - very valuable to you as time Prague
16:20 - makes progress
16:37 - okay so there are two big frameworks in
16:40 - Python but before we talk about
16:41 - framework let's talk about web
16:44 - development in general okay
16:49 - web development has to do with
16:52 - developing things on the web everything
16:54 - you see online and the main one of the
16:57 - main things I want to kind of touch on
16:59 - is web sites versus web apps okay or
17:03 - basically like solutions to problems so
17:07 - regular web sites I want you to think of
17:09 - like imagine I don't know your regular
17:13 - contact me pages your restaurant web
17:16 - sites that are super boring and just I
17:19 - don't know have like static stuff on it
17:22 - you can't really do much there just go
17:23 - just read their menu that's really yet
17:25 - or it maybe has some dudes phone number
17:27 - and you can call them or email somebody
17:29 - that's your static website but those
17:34 - things you can build in WordPress or
17:39 - Squarespace if you guys are not familiar
17:41 - with these open another tab and type
17:44 - this in so you can learn or write these
17:46 - down so you can learn them later you
17:49 - actually don't open and there are other
17:50 - tabs right now I want you guys to pay
17:52 - attention right here to me and just
17:56 - write this down and then later you can
17:57 - open up other tabs and do this okay so
18:00 - WordPress is basically like a
18:02 - point-and-click build a website
18:03 - Squarespace is a point-and-click build a
18:06 - website thing wakes and Weebly similarly
18:08 - those things people don't pay you a lot
18:12 - for those are commodities you can have
18:15 - 12 year old learn it very quickly and
18:20 - and also a lot of those are outsourced
18:23 - and there are a lot of people that can
18:25 - do them ok so any skill that's easy to
18:27 - do you're not gonna get paid for ok but
18:30 - a skill that takes a lot of time and is
18:34 - difficult you're gonna get paid for it
18:36 - and quite a bit because it's hard to
18:40 - replace you like right now and think
18:42 - about this where you are working
18:46 - how easy do you think it is to replace
18:49 - you if the answer is pretty easy then it
18:53 - probably also makes sense what you're
18:55 - getting paid right so if you think
18:59 - you're getting paid some low income and
19:02 - then you think that it's not that hard
19:04 - to replace you put the two and two
19:07 - together and the reason why you're
19:09 - probably making a lower income is cuz
19:11 - that it's easier to replace you
19:13 - but now as you start to get more
19:16 - specialized and as you learn more skills
19:18 - it's harder to replace you okay so
19:20 - generic websites that you can build with
19:23 - web web wordpress or whatever they're
19:26 - not too hard to do so you don't get paid
19:30 - much for it but the things that you do
19:31 - get paid for is for example and I'm
19:35 - gonna use big company name so it you
19:37 - guys can tie that in your head but most
19:40 - of the times when you're starting out
19:41 - you don't have to work with these big
19:43 - companies you can get started with a lot
19:45 - smaller companies that are under the
19:46 - radar and are trying to get their foot
19:49 - off the ground and get going but with
19:52 - the things that you get paid for is for
19:53 - example like Spotify is a music
19:55 - streaming problem and if you can solve
19:58 - it that's something you can get paid for
20:01 - so that's like a web app how about
20:03 - Domino's right where you can go and it'd
20:08 - be really boring if the pizza is just
20:11 - pictures of them were there and you just
20:13 - had to call them and order something but
20:15 - it's pretty dynamic you have to click on
20:18 - it you can order you can increase your
20:20 - order you can change your order when
20:21 - when you're in their app when you put
20:23 - mushrooms on your pizza
20:24 - you can choose if you want to put half
20:26 - on one side and half on the other you
20:29 - can choose what's your quantity you can
20:31 - delete and you can remove so for all of
20:35 - those things and being able to add that
20:37 - functionality that's a solution to a
20:43 - burning problem and the developers that
20:46 - got hard hire to do that would get paid
20:48 - a lot same thing with snapchat there's a
20:51 - huge networking problem there to fix how
20:54 - do you have all these people in the
20:55 - world sending each other pictures it
20:58 - goes fast it doesn't crash and
21:00 - our website and they're able to send
21:02 - pictures and videos like instantly boom
21:04 - boom boom how do you do that
21:06 - without your servers being overloaded
21:10 - right and here's a word I'm gonna give
21:15 - you guys it's called crud so write that
21:18 - down
21:19 - that's one of the things you have to
21:20 - know about as a web developer and be
21:22 - able to do pretty fast
21:25 - crud c ru D in caps so if you guys are
21:35 - here write that in comments and also
21:40 - write that you call caps crud and then
21:45 - I'm gonna tell you guys what it stands
21:47 - for - okay so write that down on your
21:50 - notes and once you guys write this down
21:52 - on your notes or your hands I don't
21:54 - really care write this down
21:57 - then let me know say something like
21:59 - three I don't know three yeah number
22:02 - three just say three once you write it
22:03 - down it'd be better if I just add them
22:07 - say crud
22:18 - cool
22:19 - crud means read it means create just
22:29 - making sure you guys are paying
22:30 - attention it means create read update
22:32 - and delete okay for things I don't know
22:38 - why I do it like I'm in Germany in
22:41 - United States we do it like this for but
22:44 - I think it's just cooler when I do when
22:46 - I do three like this I think it's really
22:47 - cool so I'm gonna keep doing it but
22:50 - that's what that means okay
22:51 - crud create read update delete write
22:54 - that down next to you on a piece of
22:57 - paper preferably and what that has to do
23:01 - with is I'll give I'll give you examples
23:03 - of where it's applied when you're when
23:06 - you're in Domino's app and you're trying
23:08 - to create an order for those of you guys
23:10 - who don't know dominoes dominoes is a
23:12 - company that delivers pizzas this off
23:14 - the pizza problem okay when you create a
23:19 - order for a pizza that's what part of
23:23 - the crud I'm now gonna quiz you guys as
23:26 - you guys watch this live stream when you
23:31 - create the pizza
23:32 - what part of crud do you think that is
23:37 - is it the see is that the or is it the U
23:42 - or the D what mines are taking them so
23:50 - long
23:50 - okay good Eric cool thank you for being
23:53 - the cool one yes good a gamer's pro tube
23:59 - he says who doesn't know Domino's you'd
24:01 - be surprised because for one you
24:03 - misspelled Domino's my friend I think
24:06 - you're talking about the Domino's game
24:08 - Domino's Pizza spelled differently
24:12 - legendary nerd laughs some people say I
24:17 - want to ate now roasted live on clever
24:21 - programmer calm that's what happens to
24:24 - being tried to roast other people get
24:25 - your get your own game in check or
24:27 - anyway sorry got off tangent okay
24:30 - that's the create part now what about
24:32 - being able to let's say you put that
24:35 - order but now you want to change that
24:37 - order okay now you want to make that
24:40 - order something different what part of
24:42 - the crud do you think that is when
24:45 - you've already created the order but now
24:47 - before hitting checkout you're like I
24:50 - don't want pepperonis on my pizza
24:52 - I just want some green peppers and
24:53 - jalapenos what part of crud is that good
25:15 - that's the update part all right and
25:19 - before I go further for those of you
25:21 - guys are like what are we doing web
25:25 - developers get paid a hundred and ten
25:28 - thousand dollars a year and believe it
25:30 - or not this is one of the things that is
25:32 - massively helpful and right now I know
25:35 - I'm having you just like kind of learn
25:36 - it and regurgitate and memorizing it was
25:38 - like oh it doesn't make sense but I
25:39 - promise you right after we're done with
25:42 - this I'm gonna kind of give you examples
25:44 - I'm gonna be giving examples of it and
25:46 - this is this is gonna be one of those
25:47 - things that saves you years of your time
25:49 - and also helps you
25:51 - now it's researchable for you so you can
25:54 - actually look at online tutorials be
25:56 - able to do this and get those jobs that
25:58 - pay you a lot and you don't need years
26:02 - of experience to get these web
26:03 - development jobs like in my PLC - or my
26:07 - video - part two of the master class
26:10 - okay that got launched it's called why
26:12 - most programmers are broke in that one I
26:16 - also share with you what things I was
26:19 - working on and what client paid me
26:21 - twenty thousand one hundred and seventy
26:23 - three dollars and thirty cents for two
26:25 - months of work and it was pretty much
26:28 - just me knowing crud and working on it
26:29 - so now let's continue forward so you
26:33 - guys know you guys have it in your mind
26:36 - why this can be actually really
26:37 - important helpful for you all right now
26:40 - when I am let's say
26:43 - let's just do last one and this is so
26:46 - obvious if I don't want my pizza anymore
26:48 - I'm just angry I don't like I just call
26:50 - Domino's service and that lady just
26:54 - didn't have the right attitude she just
26:56 - pissed me off rubbed me the wrong way
26:57 - and I'm like all right all bets are off
26:59 - and I go and I hit X on that order what
27:03 - part of the crud did I just do yeah oh
27:20 - god damn it was closed sweet good job
27:31 - you guys know your stuff patty
27:35 - that's hilarious patty poo says I do
27:37 - that all the time
27:38 - delete nice that's one of my friends too
27:42 - he always made YouTube videos of guitar
27:43 - and he deleted them and he would have
27:46 - had millions of views but instead he has
27:47 - zero views on his guitar channel yep
27:50 - good job guys it's the delete part so if
27:54 - I delete my order I've deleted so again
27:56 - crud create read update and delete okay
28:00 - and lastly I want to give you an example
28:03 - of the read part what if you have
28:06 - ordered your pizza but you don't know
28:09 - what the heck you ordered and then you
28:11 - go click view order what part of crud is
28:15 - that create read update delete what part
28:19 - of the crud is that you being able to go
28:21 - oh what the heck where what what pizza
28:23 - did i order you know clicking that view
28:25 - button
28:39 - boom
28:40 - man you guys are legends some people say
28:47 - we're lost it's okay if you're lost you
28:50 - just have to probably watch the stream a
28:53 - little bit back but just to keep you
28:55 - up-to-date if you're new right if you
28:57 - just enter the stream right now we're
29:01 - talking about web development and how in
29:02 - web development there's something very
29:05 - big concept called crud and Sanford
29:07 - create read update and delete and now
29:10 - I'm giving examples of Domino's a big
29:13 - company like Domino's uses crud a
29:15 - company like Spotify users crud for
29:17 - example if I want to add a music to the
29:20 - playlist
29:21 - maybe that creates a new music in my
29:23 - playlist so that's create if I click on
29:26 - it that gives me goes into it that's
29:28 - read and if I want to maybe shuffle it I
29:31 - don't know that's like updating it and
29:33 - if I want to remove it from my playlist
29:34 - that's delete okay
29:36 - same way with Netflix same way with
29:39 - YouTube every all of these apps can be
29:42 - pretty much summed up with one word if
29:45 - you want to call it crud okay that's
29:48 - what we're talking about and right now
29:49 - we're just quizzing everybody live on
29:51 - crud and making them understand the
29:54 - concept of this looking at comments just
30:05 - whoa nice okay awesome Tomo is now the
30:15 - moderator of the chat because he bribed
30:18 - us first with some with some super chats
30:21 - no not just kidding he he's doing a good
30:24 - job with the chat wow that's really cool
30:26 - I didn't even know you can make
30:27 - moderators well welcome Domo
30:34 - yeah so crud is love okay so for again
30:39 - for those you guys are new write these
30:41 - things down best development frameworks
30:44 - in Python
30:45 - there's Django and then there's flask
30:48 - write that down I'm gonna come back to
30:50 - that point okay what we're talking about
30:55 - is the big picture view of web
30:57 - development we're talking about how much
30:59 - Python web developers get paid so
31:01 - according to indeed.com if you look at
31:04 - it right now
31:06 - average Django Python developer makes a
31:11 - hundred and ten thousand and six hundred
31:13 - and ten dollars every single year and
31:21 - one of the key concepts their entire job
31:25 - could be summarized in is with one word
31:28 - crud okay so say it with me what the
31:31 - crud I get paid one hundred and ten
31:34 - thousand dollars a year for crud what
31:37 - the crud it's crazy so if you've written
31:42 - down crud if you've written down Django
31:45 - if you've written out flasks all these
31:47 - things you guys can research later also
31:49 - Python web developers and how much they
31:52 - make you could research later we've
31:57 - talked about WordPress and Squarespace
31:59 - being able to build boring sites but
32:03 - Python can help you build web apps okay
32:07 - that can provide solutions these are not
32:10 - things that you can just do in
32:11 - Squarespace and you know point-and-click
32:13 - these are things that you have to use
32:15 - real powerful programming languages for
32:18 - to solve problems things problems with
32:21 - things like Dropbox cloud storage
32:23 - problem solved with Python YouTube video
32:27 - sharing problem solved with Python I've
32:33 - already talked about Spotify reddit a
32:36 - social network for sharing links and
32:38 - threads and I don't even know it's very
32:41 - complicated for me a reddit was a social
32:44 - problem solved with Python
32:47 - Instagram similarly a photo sharing
32:50 - problem solved with Python so you can
32:54 - see that these massive companies are
32:56 - using it Google a search engine problem
32:58 - solved with Python okay so you have to
33:01 - build really custom solutions for it and
33:03 - ultimately again it comes down to crud
33:06 - alright it comes down to kind of one
33:08 - thing and crud is all over in games as
33:13 - well when you're playing video games
33:14 - okay when your character creates a new
33:16 - weapon then being able to see that
33:19 - weapon you click view weapon if you want
33:22 - to then add a little bit of firepower to
33:24 - that weapon so it increases its damage
33:26 - that's what you know be thinking about
33:29 - it so as I ask you just quickly in your
33:31 - mind just be active don't just sit there
33:33 - passively watching it just breathing
33:34 - because if you're just breathing and
33:36 - watching why even beyond the stream
33:39 - you're not getting anything out of it
33:41 - okay so I want to respect you and your
33:43 - time so that's why I tell you to
33:44 - actively learn and as I ask you
33:47 - questions just be quick and be right
33:49 - there have your pen and paper and just
33:50 - write down answers to everything I'm
33:52 - saying kind of like I'm right there with
33:54 - you okay alright what did I just say
33:57 - do you remember I lost my train of
33:59 - thought I got it games right okay so
34:06 - when you add magic to your weapon that's
34:09 - the update part all right and then when
34:12 - you maybe don't want that weapon anymore
34:13 - you don't want that shield anymore you
34:15 - that's the delete part so keep thinking
34:19 - about crud as you're going through life
34:21 - and be looking at things like that
34:23 - because that's another thing that can be
34:27 - helping you build that can be helping
34:31 - you build your own Python freelance
34:33 - character okay you're building the skill
34:35 - points so maybe in your skill tree you
34:37 - have Jango and as you put more time into
34:40 - Jango and build that skill tree right
34:44 - then maybe you learn about things like
34:46 - crud along that Jango tree or that flask
34:51 - tree and you become more and more
34:53 - valuable getting yourself closer to
34:56 - being able to land those jobs that pay
34:57 - you a hundred and ten thousand dollars a
34:59 - year
35:00 - oh look at this proof I went to you told
35:15 - me to show this right proof I went to
35:18 - Oakland Community College look at this
35:21 - it's showing correctly here oh look how
35:27 - a mustache my pen so if you guys are
35:39 - enjoying this so far give me a hell yeah
35:43 - before I continue because if you guys
35:48 - are not super chatting me and paying me
35:49 - money on YouTube
35:51 - you guys got to give me something so I
35:52 - continue
36:15 - let's keep this right here and I just
36:20 - monster has to sponsor me at some point
36:22 - and pay me for this yeah okay good good
36:27 - good good
36:33 - this is awesome man I love these guys
36:35 - could be here like I wish that we could
36:38 - just be in like the seminar place and
36:39 - then I could just like help everybody
36:41 - I'd just be running around be like boom
36:43 - boom boom boom boom and helping you guys
36:44 - build your things Hudson says I love
36:51 - your face no Hudson I love your face
36:53 - more my friend okay so if you sounds
37:02 - like you guys are loving this I want to
37:05 - pause for a moment before I continue
37:07 - again a lot of these things I go into
37:10 - deep in my profitable programmer
37:13 - masterclass which I just launched this
37:16 - class is absolutely free okay free2go
37:27 - and part two is called why the best
37:30 - programmers are broke and then part two
37:33 - again I show you how you can become a
37:36 - Python developer in less than 30 days if
37:38 - you have no time no money no degree and
37:41 - you feel like you're old or whatever and
37:44 - I'm just saying these things so people
37:47 - who jump into the livestream now they
37:49 - know where to go and what to do okay in
37:51 - this part 2 training series you know
37:54 - training video in my profitable
37:57 - programmer training I also go over how I
38:01 - made one hundred and four thousand
38:03 - dollars as a Oakton Community College
38:04 - student and apparently I have this pen
38:06 - too which is cool cuz just proof for you
38:10 - guys mmm not that I know you guys
38:14 - believe me but just want to throw it in
38:16 - there for those of you guys for luck
38:18 - and I go through that and I also show
38:22 - you guys literally
38:23 - my behind-the-scenes code some of it
38:25 - that I used to build this Python app
38:27 - okay for that client who paid me $20,000
38:30 - for two months of work less than two
38:32 - months of work and I got that client in
38:35 - 90 days of me going from zero coding
38:38 - skills knowing nothing about coding
38:41 - knowing not a single line of code to
38:44 - then landing this client in 90 days and
38:46 - then making 20k with this client and
38:49 - then going on to make 100k that one year
38:53 - okay that was my first year I started to
38:55 - code and that was my year yeah I was
38:58 - doing Python freelancing so if that's
39:01 - something that interests you right now
39:03 - pause what you're doing open a new tab
39:05 - click the link below
39:07 - it's called clever programmer 2 slash
39:10 - master class followed by whatever and
39:13 - it'll take you right to the master class
39:15 - so you can sign in sign up for it and
39:17 - then as the three videos that are
39:19 - supposed to get launched they're gonna
39:21 - get sent right to you also in the second
39:24 - video also in this second video I'm
39:29 - gonna be giving you your portfolio as a
39:31 - for a Python freelancer it's built
39:35 - specially for Python freelancers that
39:37 - you can literally download okay and
39:39 - steal from me and then what you can do
39:43 - is it has a my work section so as you
39:44 - continue your journey as a Python
39:46 - freelancer you can plug and chug your
39:49 - Python projects in this portfolio so I'm
39:52 - gonna be just giving away a full on
39:54 - portfolio again by itself this would be
39:58 - like a hundred or two hundred dollar
39:59 - course but I'm giving that portfolio
40:02 - away to you guys for free I'm also
40:04 - sharing the behind-the-scenes code for
40:07 - those of you guys who have missed part
40:09 - one of the training big mistake but it's
40:12 - still up all of these training videos
40:15 - are up for a limited time until I take
40:17 - them down but in part one we cover a lot
40:21 - of things a lot of things what do we
40:23 - cover
40:35 - so in part one like my friend said we
40:39 - show you your Python earning potential
40:41 - and we have put together a calculator
40:45 - for you that can show you what your
40:46 - earning potential for as a Python
40:48 - freelancer would be like okay so for
40:50 - example say that you got one client at
40:53 - $50 an hour you work with that client
40:55 - for ten hours and write this math down
40:58 - to because I'm gonna go through it fast
40:59 - because I've went through it in my last
41:01 - live stream but you again I'm gonna
41:03 - start again fifty dollars an hour you
41:07 - work with this client for ten hours a
41:09 - week and that's one of the lowest rate
41:11 - you can charge the Python freelancer
41:14 - week one you make five hundred dollars
41:17 - and in monthly you make two thousand
41:20 - dollars and yearly from that one client
41:22 - you make twenty four thousand dollars
41:24 - two thousand dollars pays for all this
41:26 - extra stuff phone bills Netflix Hulu
41:28 - whatever office rental stuff car
41:33 - insurance dental insurance I don't know
41:36 - whatever and the twenty four thousand
41:38 - dollars you could be using to start a
41:41 - new startup or put in 401k or Charles
41:43 - Schwab or make that investment you've
41:45 - always wanted to make extra income does
41:47 - not hurt and I help you calculate your
41:50 - Python earning potential by giving you
41:52 - the calculator you could literally steal
41:54 - and download and then also I have a
41:56 - worksheet for you that helps you figure
41:58 - out your Python freelancer lifestyle
42:00 - again all of that is for free
42:03 - unbelievable I can't even believe I give
42:05 - you guys all the stuff for free so just
42:07 - go and take advantage of it all right
42:09 - please would you do that for me if
42:11 - you're here go ahead and do that link is
42:14 - in the description on Facebook the link
42:18 - is in bio on Instagram and link is in
42:21 - description on YouTube now with that
42:25 - shameless plug being out of the way
42:27 - let's continue moving forward
42:39 - okay Sheldon here's what I want you to
42:44 - do on YouTube I see you say when I load
42:47 - the profitable programmer portfolio I
42:49 - only get plain HTML I want you to email
42:54 - us I'm not gonna announce what the email
42:57 - is because then this YouTube video gets
42:59 - launched in the sly stream gets washed
43:01 - and everybody just emails us at once go
43:03 - to my website clever programmer calm at
43:05 - the bottom hit continue to website and
43:08 - then go to the contact page get our
43:11 - email from there and then send me an
43:14 - email and I'll personally get on a call
43:15 - with you and I'll help you figure out
43:17 - how to put that portfolio together for
43:19 - yourself Sheldon okay also for those
43:23 - other people that might be going through
43:25 - the same problem don't take the
43:28 - index.html file out of the folder
43:31 - everybody this is for the people who
43:33 - went through part two of my training
43:35 - which is called why most programmers are
43:37 - broke and in there I let you download a
43:40 - portfolio app that's built specially for
43:43 - Python freelancers and when you open
43:46 - them that portfolio you literally have
43:48 - it you've just stolen it from me like
43:49 - this and I have video instructions on
43:51 - how to copy it but if you take out that
43:54 - index.html file that I gave you in the
43:55 - folder and put it somewhere else and
43:57 - then double click and open it it'll kind
44:00 - of give you wrong stuff meaning it'll
44:02 - give you only a plain HTML file without
44:04 - CSS there meaning the styling so think
44:08 - of it like a human without clothes hTML
44:11 - is like a person without clothes was
44:13 - just naked and then the CSS part the
44:16 - cascading style sheet is what gives you
44:18 - that style puts on that clothing and
44:20 - makes you look good okay so you're still
44:24 - a person meaning your website still
44:25 - exists with HTML you still have links
44:28 - and you have you know words on it
44:31 - but it looks really boring and it
44:33 - doesn't look interesting and it just
44:35 - creeps people out but then when you ask
44:38 - CSS to it then it makes people feel
44:40 - comfortable and actually enjoy spending
44:44 - time on that website okay
44:48 - man we are making some dough for making
44:53 - some money on YouTube man all right
44:58 - monkey says how much money doesn't
45:00 - create apps course cost monkey two three
45:05 - one six again I want you to go to my
45:07 - website hit continue to website go to
45:09 - contact email us it's email us and I
45:13 - will tell you exactly how much the
45:16 - course cost just for you okay if I am on
45:20 - the live stream and if I say how much
45:22 - the course cost if this video is being
45:24 - used later and the course price has
45:26 - changed whether it's down or up it will
45:29 - just confuse the heck out of people so I
45:31 - don't want to do that to people and
45:32 - confuse them I want this video to be up
45:35 - there forever and give value to
45:37 - everybody okay so make sure you go to my
45:39 - website and you email us and what the
45:41 - hell I'll just say it it's support a
45:42 - clever programmer calm okay just email
45:45 - us there I don't care how many people
45:47 - email us there will reply back to most
45:49 - of you it's hard to reply back to
45:51 - everybody cuz there's just so many

46:12 - quizzes is Python the best language for
46:14 - this ok Tiffany I actually have
46:17 - experience with generating leads with
46:20 - creating custom quizzes with Python and
46:24 - without Python here's what I'm gonna
46:27 - tell you if your job requires you to
46:31 - know programming and build this with
46:33 - Python and integrate this with Python
46:35 - then yes Python would be a very good
46:37 - choice to make this happen
46:38 - but if you're just looking to help your
46:41 - clients generate leads so then you
46:43 - become a more profitable consultant or
46:47 - they pay you more and you become that
46:48 - trusted advisor you don't have to do
46:51 - this task on your own you can use an
46:53 - amazing service like typeform comm or
46:55 - you can use Survey Monkey comm to create
46:59 - custom quizzes
47:01 - and qualify leads essentially okay I
47:03 - assume that's what you're trying to do
47:05 - right you're trying to ask your leads if
47:07 - Tiffany asks a question in here just let
47:09 - me know in the stream but basically what
47:12 - you're trying to do I assume is help
47:14 - your clients qualify the leads that
47:17 - they're getting and make sure that
47:20 - they're good leads right these are
47:21 - people who actually will not waste the
47:23 - time of your clients so something like
47:26 - typeform calm is great it was awesome
47:30 - for me when I was trying to get
47:32 - one-on-one students for clever
47:33 - programmer and work with them one-on-one
47:35 - and do mentoring now I don't do as much
47:38 - mentoring I've pretty much I haven't
47:41 - been doing one-on-one mentoring for a
47:42 - while because I want to provide content
47:45 - to all of the students so that's why
47:48 - I've kind of stopped but I was using
47:49 - type form for that hopefully that
47:51 - answers your question Tiffany but again
47:54 - if you want to use something with Python
47:56 - look into Django and you'll be able to
47:58 - put together custom quizzes fairly
48:00 - easily look on Stack Overflow and now
48:02 - point you in the right direction thank
48:03 - you for the $5 donation
48:10 - [Music]
48:20 - yeah qualified leads from social ads I
48:23 - figured yeah cool Glenn says I would
48:32 - like to do a CRM project awesome Glenn
48:37 - you can use Python for a CRM project as
48:40 - well I in my part two video why best
48:44 - programmers are bro or my most
48:46 - programmers were broke
48:47 - I literally show you again that app that
48:49 - I made and I show you some behind the
48:51 - scenes code and that AB that client paid
48:53 - me twenty thousand dollars for that app
48:55 - is actually made with that app I made
48:59 - and the project was on CRM so I built a
49:02 - customer relationship management system
49:04 - for my clients and I give you guys a
49:06 - little sneak peek of the work that I did
49:09 - and some of the work that was involved
49:25 - this last teams livestream song is
49:28 - pretty cool I like answering technical
49:29 - questions it's me going also it's
49:35 - probably the monster Matt you're welcome
49:37 - hey guys um on YouTube or wherever who
49:43 - was able to download the portfolio and
49:45 - it worked well for them just say what
49:51 - should we have them say he always my
49:59 - friend all this comes up with one okay
50:01 - so say one if you were able to download
50:07 - that portfolio and it worked well for
50:09 - you
50:09 - also I'm scared my live stream might die
50:12 - on Instagram let's just check it out 9%
50:16 - keep it reminding me to check it out
50:24 - okay so monkey just monkey monkey three
50:29 - two one six just emailed us so just
50:33 - respond back and let's see what's going
50:37 - on here okay
50:40 - yeah alright so for people it worked for
50:44 - some people it did not work somos thank
50:48 - you so much for moderating the chats he
50:50 - says he has school tomorrow
50:52 - yeah thank you thank you thank you and
50:54 - you did a great job Tomo enjoy your
50:56 - school
50:57 - somebody says 0.5
51:08 - why couldn't you download it Naruto yeah
51:15 - it's supposed to show you the final file
51:17 - and in that final file when you click
51:19 - it's a folder when you click in it it
51:22 - has index.html come here dude just so
51:28 - they can see your face your face looks
51:29 - on point they want to see you from now
51:39 - they're gonna think I'm crazy and I'm
51:40 - just talking to myself just say hi to
51:43 - them they miss you there we go that's my
51:50 - boy Mustapha goes by Clark Co CLU X I
51:55 - owe Glen link is in the description my
52:05 - friend so go ahead and do that
52:16 - guys just go go through the video I've
52:18 - put together for you that will help you
52:21 - get the portfolio alright anyways now
52:25 - let's talk a little bit about Python
52:27 - frameworks so there are two big
52:29 - frameworks Jango and flask like I've
52:31 - mentioned here are my recommendations
52:34 - flask is pretty simple but the problem
52:38 - is that okay let's just talk about
52:41 - quickly what a framework is so if you
52:44 - were to do web development Python you
52:46 - would have to pull out your hair
52:48 - not because of Python Python is awesome
52:50 - but because web development you'd have
52:52 - to write all your own code but if you
52:54 - use a framework with Python like flask
52:58 - the benefit of that is that it does all
53:03 - the big heavy lifting for you that you
53:05 - don't have to worry about anymore so
53:07 - creating servers and making things go
53:09 - online on a website
53:11 - okay make other people be able to see
53:13 - your website it's super easy you can do
53:16 - it with just a few lines of code flask
53:18 - is super light weight again as I'm
53:22 - talking write these things down flask is
53:25 - pretty lightweight and it's cool but the
53:28 - problem is because it's too lightweight
53:29 - sometimes it's you have to write a lot
53:31 - of code to make things work whereas
53:34 - Django is a little bit more advanced
53:37 - looking and can be confusing sometimes
53:40 - but it's what we call batteries included
53:43 - and it comes with a lot of libraries a
53:45 - lot of big things juicy meaty things
53:49 - built in there so think of it like bunch
53:52 - of developers who gave up and had
53:55 - sleepless nights God probably divorces
53:59 - because it works so hard and like got
54:01 - huge eye bags writing all this code and
54:04 - creating this amazing thing for you and
54:06 - now you can just steal it with just a
54:08 - few lines of code and use it okay so
54:11 - think of it think of Django like that
54:13 - and you could build things pretty
54:15 - quickly so me I'm personally more a fan
54:19 - of your mic is too good I can hear you
54:22 - gulping down what are you drinking I'm
54:26 - drinking monster and I did not know you
54:29 - guys could
54:29 - hear me gulp okay somebody just said can
54:33 - we see more cluck Co I don't know guys
54:36 - do you guys want to see more of cluck Co
54:43 - how much would that ya type one all was
54:46 - his idea to type one how much would that
54:47 - suck if they're all like none of us want
54:49 - to see you like they just start typing
54:51 - zero
54:52 - oh yeah we should do that have you
54:58 - delirious
55:02 - yeah create apps and land your first
55:05 - climb with Python course it will be
55:07 - pre-recorded but you'll get each piece
55:10 - of content like a week from now like
55:13 - every week essentially oh man
55:24 - oh man Akash Renaldo all right you heard
55:32 - him this is what they want somebody just
55:37 - says a child's kids yell okay come on in
55:40 - bro what's up everybody how you guys
55:44 - doing clicks you back again welcome back
55:46 - to Ghazis livestream all right click Co
55:53 - so talk about some technical Python
55:55 - stuff and help I will not be able to
55:57 - answer any of those questions but uh if
56:00 - you guys need some photography help
56:02 - YouTube help I got you guys yeah he's
56:05 - just a pretty face
56:06 - for this live stream we both got our
56:10 - like haircuts today I was looking on
56:12 - point my hair is kind of messed up right
56:14 - now yeah I didn't gel it up or anything
56:16 - but straight out of the shower we are
56:17 - looking fresh yeah yeah this guy's been
56:21 - like my brother we we became friends
56:23 - when dude like when we were 10 years old
56:26 - like 10 years old I heard those of you
56:29 - guys who don't know hilarious okay
56:36 - sorry guys all right inappropriate back
56:40 - to the live stream
56:42 - about I I was born in Pakistan and I was
56:46 - born in a very very very small city that
56:48 - most of people don't even know exists
56:49 - its called Peshawar and every time I say
56:52 - that to people they're like ha ha
56:54 - pshh our like a pee shower I always get
56:57 - a kick out of it
56:58 - and he was born in Pakistan as well but
57:00 - he was he's from Karachi okay
57:03 - so literally everybody who comes to
57:06 - united states from Pakistan it's not
57:07 - like two cities okay its Karachi and
57:09 - Islamabad and that's pretty much it
57:11 - every other city nobody makes it out of
57:13 - there and you know nobody does they're
57:17 - all just stay in Pakistan even though to
57:19 - try to come to America I came here at
57:22 - the age of nine and then I met him about
57:24 - when I was ten years old and then we we
57:27 - have known each other since then so it's
57:30 - been a long journey I'm now 23 years old
57:32 - and yeah we used to be like little tiny
57:35 - babies and we used to make these stupid
57:38 - videos and now we grew older and we
57:40 - still are little tiny babies that make
57:42 - stupid videos except now we just have
57:44 - beards oh yeah that's literally the only
57:47 - difference 30 year long time friends
57:50 - damn yeah they know we were that old no
57:53 - no not 30 okay fine I'm not gonna I'm
57:58 - from Kazakhstan exactly it's pretty much
58:00 - the same thing as long as none mean it's
58:02 - just a little spelling difference Wow
58:07 - pom pom laughing emoji love the glasses
58:12 - mine or cozies I'm from India cool cool
58:18 - I'm it's not such a small it's not such
58:21 - a small city Lahore Aslam but I'm from
58:23 - India cool cool pretty cool the shower
58:28 - can now be called a small city grew up
58:32 - in Chicago all right okay so oh we're
58:37 - going offline on Instagram I want to
58:39 - give you value before Instagram goes
58:42 - offline okay so I have one minute and 20
58:44 - something seconds okay give a round of
58:48 - applause to cluck Co so send the
58:50 - clapping emoji okay so web development
58:53 - django developers make about a hundred
58:55 - and ten
58:56 - and dollars a year jingle is my more
58:58 - preferred framework it's a little bit
59:00 - advanced but if it's taught to you the
59:02 - right way you can pick it up fast and
59:05 - then you don't have to look back jingo
59:07 - is my preferred way to go write that
59:10 - down
59:10 - second best text editors or coding
59:15 - editors for python so there are a lot of
59:17 - them there is sublime text there is at
59:20 - hum and then there is PyCharm sublime
59:23 - text and atom you can use
59:26 - interchangeably sublime text that
59:29 - annoying thing is it keeps asking for
59:30 - purchase whereas atom is completely free
59:32 - so you guys can just download atom to
59:35 - write your code in pie chart is my
59:38 - personal favorite IDE or let's just
59:42 - simplify and say coding editor it's my
59:44 - favorite but I would recommend you guys
59:46 - to get into pycharm
59:48 - around the second or third month mark of
59:50 - your coding because it is a little bit
59:52 - more technical and it is a little bit
59:55 - more advanced and in the start it might
59:57 - confuse you more than it helps you
59:58 - because of how big it is but again is
60:01 - just a few practical things you need to
60:03 - know and then boom boom boom you're all
60:04 - caught up look at this how many collapse
60:06 - you're getting all right oh damn it I
60:09 - couldn't give my outro to San Instagram
60:12 - it's okay Instagram still knows we love
60:14 - them
60:15 - ok just saving it and then I'm gonna hit
60:17 - share um coo coo coo coo coo cool
60:22 - alright so for someone who wants to
60:26 - enter into web dev what would you advise
60:29 - them Jango seems challenging with their
60:31 - setups and admin Django is honestly
60:36 - pretty simple to get started with just
60:40 - the starting part is sometimes tricky
60:42 - but once you get past a little bit of
60:44 - starting time it's pretty easy to build
60:46 - things up really fast with Django so
60:49 - again I'm a huge fan of Django but if
60:52 - you have extra time in your life learn a
60:55 - little bit of flask maybe spend a week
60:57 - learning flask and that will show you
61:00 - the things you need to be doing with web
61:04 - development and how you're doing them
61:05 - because you're gonna be writing each
61:07 - line of code yourself you'll get a good
61:09 - grasp
61:10 - what the heck is going on and then when
61:11 - you do them in Django you'll just be
61:13 - like oh it's just like this thing I did
61:14 - in Flast except it's easier now and it
61:16 - won't confuse you okay so that's really
61:18 - it and let's put this or actually I'm
61:30 - sorry I'll just do it okay got it
61:37 - see easy PC selfie stick guys this is
61:43 - awesome by the way boom you can increase
61:46 - it boom like this then it has this
61:52 - remote the Bluetooth so you can press
61:54 - this button to take a picture you can
61:56 - change it landscape or portrait mode for
61:59 - your phone and this Bluetooth thing it's
62:02 - like a remote and it even comes out and
62:04 - then you could put this far away and you
62:06 - could take a picture and then last thing
62:09 - I didn't show you guys this is pretty
62:10 - cool you get actually it has a little
62:12 - tripod and boom you could put it on the
62:16 - table you know and then set it up and
62:19 - there you go and it's very compact once
62:23 - you pack it up looks like this man I
62:25 - should be doing some affiliate marketing
62:30 - all right
62:37 - yeah free advertising unfortunately but
62:44 - feel free to super chat me on YouTube so
62:47 - if you super chat me and pay me money I
62:49 - will love you and I will answer I answer
62:53 - everybody's question but I might go
62:55 - deeper into your question but just make
63:00 - sure it's a good question unfortunately
63:04 - I'm not getting paid to advertise that
63:06 - but I should be um Elias says do you
63:11 - play any video game if so which ones I
63:15 - used to play a lot of video games and
63:18 - love them but again as the title of the
63:21 - stream which has build your own Python
63:23 - freelance character what I realized was
63:28 - my life was like a game and if I built
63:32 - points I could stay with them and they
63:33 - don't like leave you when you end the
63:35 - game and that's when it hit me and I
63:39 - just stopped playing video games and
63:41 - like before I would guilt myself and be
63:45 - like why am I having just a conversation
63:46 - I'm talking about when I was young like
63:48 - twelve thirteen and I'd be like what am
63:50 - I talking with people I could be
63:52 - spending this time in the video game and
63:53 - my character would be leveling off now
63:55 - we're now about to play a video game I'm
63:57 - like why am I gonna level up my
63:58 - character in a video game when I could
64:00 - be leveling up my character in real life
64:02 - me and building those skill points up so
64:05 - now when I closed the game the character
64:08 - is still there and when I sleep and wake
64:10 - up the character is still there and if
64:12 - my hard drive is lost or my playstation
64:14 - is broken or my xbox is broken or my
64:16 - computer is broken or the lights go on
64:18 - out in my house the character is still
64:20 - there and then in life I just had to
64:23 - decide which character I was gonna be
64:26 - building and at some point I was like
64:28 - okay you know Python freelancing from a
64:30 - courier situation I was trying to do IT
64:32 - absolutely hated it and then I'm like
64:35 - okay I'm not gonna be building IT
64:36 - character I hate that freaking character
64:38 - and then I found Python and then in
64:41 - Python I found freelancing and I'm like
64:42 - okay I'm gonna be building a Python
64:44 - freelancing character and boom boom boom
64:46 - let's go and that's when I really
64:48 - stopped playing games
64:49 - laughs hilarious Rose shraddha says Kazi
64:52 - level 23 yes
64:58 - geo says what's your skills besides
65:00 - Python and Django absolutely none I'm
65:03 - useless don't really know anything just
65:05 - get by with luck okay other skills I
65:17 - couldn't see any question so I guess
65:19 - it's time to brag bring out the big guns
65:20 - not really but other skills you kind of
65:23 - have to know as a developer they're not
65:26 - that many but and you can learn them as
65:28 - you go and they're kind of
65:30 - interchangeable and mixed together okay
65:31 - so for example I know multiple skills so
65:35 - when you know Python and you know Django
65:37 - there's some other things that you end
65:39 - up learning along the way without even
65:41 - trying so html/css that's one of those
65:45 - things you end up learning okay maybe
65:47 - you can learn other tools like
65:49 - JavaScript okay
65:51 - and we'll get more into that and maybe
65:54 - later actually in the next livestream
65:56 - I'll talk about api's all right I'll
66:01 - talk about api's I'll talk about HTML
66:04 - and CSS and how it all connects with
66:07 - Python I'm taking these notes so I could
66:09 - talk about this and um got to take them
66:13 - faster
66:19 - actually have a better idea why don't I
66:21 - do things that you guys want instead of
66:23 - coming up with my own things which I'm
66:24 - pretty good at but you guys are better
66:27 - at it because you know what you want
66:28 - more than I do
66:29 - so in the comments for the next
66:32 - livestream why don't you guys tell me
66:34 - what I should cover and what you guys
66:37 - would like to know and if those things
66:38 - were good
66:39 - maybe I'll go over them in the next
66:41 - livestream and just keep looking at the
66:44 - chat whenever you get a chance so we
66:46 - know what things cuz sometimes what
66:47 - happens is we close out and then the
66:49 - last chat goes away and we lose
66:51 - everything
66:51 - oh yeah that's a good one front end back
66:55 - end I forgot yeah that's a good one
66:57 - front end talk about back-end front-end
67:01 - back-end and full stack Jesus okay I
67:11 - also don't want to overwhelm you guys
67:14 - with too much in one so I'm gonna be
67:16 - trying to give you one tip after another
67:18 - and I'm gonna be trying to go live every
67:21 - single day so don't miss out and before
67:25 - I continue forward again guys all of
67:29 - this and more I've put together the
67:31 - profitable programmer masterclass for
67:32 - you so you can learn all of these things
67:34 - and more get your first client in less
67:37 - than 90 days get that first paycheck
67:39 - with Python so go in the link click it
67:43 - and then sign up for the master class
67:45 - I've put together three amazing powerful
67:48 - life-changing videos for you guys in
67:50 - there that will guide you through from
67:52 - what the hell is going on what is web
67:56 - development how much can you be earning
67:58 - what's sure Python earning potential all
68:00 - the way through giving you portfolios
68:03 - that you can literally download and
68:04 - steal learning potential calculators
68:06 - that you can steal and use for yourself
68:07 - so you can figure out what you'll be
68:09 - earning as a Python freelancer along
68:11 - with the roadmap that you can follow to
68:14 - become that Python developer slash
68:16 - freelancer slash somebody who wants to
68:19 - do it as a side hustle or work for big
68:21 - companies in less than 90 days okay
68:25 - without needing a degree without needing
68:27 - any experience without needing any
68:29 - technical skills and without
68:33 - your age being you're in high school or
68:35 - you're about to retire okay so go in the
68:39 - links right now in the description and
68:41 - get on my master class the profitable

68:48 - description click the link on YouTube
68:50 - and do it now
69:08 - okay that's a good one Julian asks how
69:11 - the hell to use github and she says it

70:16 - but if you are ready and you want to
70:18 - just look at it and you're interested go
70:19 - to upward calm and just type in Python
70:21 - jobs okay that will tell you what kind
70:24 - of jobs you could be doing but again
70:26 - these are things that I'm gonna be
70:28 - helping you guys go through step by step
70:30 - and that's my goal to help you get that
70:32 - client and know what framework or what
70:35 - system or what roadmap to follow to be
70:37 - able to do that and get past all those
70:39 - problems
70:44 - Patti Pugh says I would like to know how
70:47 - much if any sequel is used in relation
70:49 - to Python when you use flask you have to
70:53 - know quite a bit of sequel but if you
70:56 - use Django there's something called an
70:59 - ORM there is an ORM in flask as well and
71:02 - it's called it stands for an object
71:06 - relational relation mapper
71:10 - okay so an object relation mapper ORM
71:14 - write this down but this won't be
71:16 - important for you till maybe a few weeks
71:20 - into your web development
71:22 - start working with databases okay this
71:25 - was something that I don't know why the
71:27 - hell nobody's explained on the Internet
71:29 - and it took me literally like so long to
71:31 - figure out how to make apps and put them
71:33 - together and make them come to life
71:37 - so for you I'm gonna be saying this and
71:41 - write this down again when you use an
71:43 - ORM you really don't know you don't have
71:46 - to know how to use sequel and you could
71:48 - be using Django and sequel in and as one
71:52 - so python is sequel as one and ORM lets
71:55 - you combine the two without having to
71:57 - know sequel too much sequel but
72:00 - obviously having the knowledge of it
72:01 - would help you Hadj edge amamiya asks
72:07 - your class enough or have to follow
72:09 - other courses my class will give you the
72:12 - roadmap my course that's coming out
72:14 - mid-november
72:16 - will give you the exact how-to and all
72:19 - the code and everything that goes along
72:20 - with it and that will be enough for you
72:23 - to go from doing zero Python to having
72:26 - apps and having portfolios having the
72:29 - tools and the skill set you need to land
72:31 - your first client and that course will
72:34 - help you land your first client in less
72:36 - than 90 days okay that's the goal of
72:39 - that course along with I'm gonna be
72:41 - interviewing people from places like
72:44 - uber and Google and people who might
72:48 - even have made codecademy and I'm gonna
72:51 - try to interview the best full-time
72:53 - Python developers I'm gonna try to
72:55 - interview the best freelance Python
72:57 - developers Python freelancers and I'm
73:00 - gonna try to put it in a vault for you
73:02 - guys so you guys can also get those
73:05 - interviews and those will be massively
73:08 - valuable Cassandra Blackman says will
73:13 - there be any discussion and how to
73:15 - negotiate pay with people who want to
73:16 - hire you absolutely in the PLC videos I
73:20 - will be covering some of that and my
73:22 - course will go in a lot of detail about
73:24 - this my course will be a lot different
73:27 - because of that 85% of your financial
73:31 - success guys comes from your likability
73:34 - or negotiation skills your commune
73:36 - education skills 15% of it comes from
73:39 - technical knowledge
73:41 - I'm not saying technical knowledge is
73:43 - bad what I am saying is if you want to
73:45 - be able to comfortably support yourself
73:47 - get paid what you deserve
73:49 - travel spend time and your family maybe
73:52 - even be able to support your family and
73:53 - be able to do that as fast as possible
73:56 - you have to put you know when you're
73:59 - building a Python freelancer characters
74:00 - skill tree you want to put those skill
74:02 - points in places that get you paid the
74:05 - fastest okay and have you doing
74:08 - practical things and working on projects
74:10 - and working with companies the fastest
74:12 - and those are the skills I want to give
74:13 - you
74:14 - negotiation is a big big big skill and
74:17 - we're gonna be talking about that so you
74:20 - can learn it and you don't have to worry
74:22 - about it anymore
74:25 - throughout the video someone keeps
74:27 - coughing is another CP team getting sick
74:29 - don't worry too hard guys don't worry
74:32 - guys we drink we drink airborne and that
74:36 - helps us stay on sick actually immune
74:41 - and makes us a mute all right should I
74:46 - continue watching live or watch part 2
74:49 - if you're here sign up right now to the
74:52 - master class and start watching the
74:56 - second video watch the first video and
74:58 - watch the second video they're both very
75:00 - important and they're tied together if
75:02 - you just skip ahead to two you're gonna
75:05 - miss out on what the heck is going on
75:07 - and my friend just put the link in below
75:10 - so go ahead and click that link and join
75:14 - it Elias says I'm a community college
75:20 - student I major in civil engineering but
75:22 - I'd be recently huh I've you recently
75:25 - started to become interested into
75:27 - programming any advice
75:31 - watch and take online courses that might
75:34 - be free so you can just kind of get the
75:36 - idea of it and then if you're interested
75:38 - invest in some courses good quality
75:41 - courses but work on practical skills
75:44 - okay also try to find mentors in real
75:47 - life so places like meetup groups or
75:50 - helpful all right but in the start in
75:52 - the absolute start I want you to spend
75:54 - more time playing and building fun
75:56 - things rather than going through
75:58 - tutorial after tutorial like you have
76:00 - some kind of purpose and burning
76:01 - yourself out so if you're starting out
76:03 - my advice is have fun doesn't matter if
76:06 - it takes you like you know a month or
76:09 - like 15 days to make a simple
76:13 - I don't know age calculator app it
76:15 - doesn't matter what matters is you have
76:18 - fun as you go along you feel like you
76:20 - did it on your own you gain that
76:21 - confidence and you enjoy it
76:23 - you have your full lifetime ahead of you
76:26 - to get better alright and I'll show you
76:28 - guys hacks to get better faster my whole
76:33 - thing is getting fast better faster in
76:35 - months and not years alright and that's
76:39 - what I want to help you do I want to
76:40 - help you become Python developers and
76:42 - freelancers in months and not years
76:50 - zakir says young savage while you
76:52 - trapping so hard well you got a 12 car
76:56 - garage but only got six cars and then I
77:01 - love that song if you guys are here on
77:03 - this live stream right down this is
77:06 - another important note Rockstar I love
77:09 - that song so much and then there's
77:12 - another song that really grew on the
77:13 - entire clever programmer team and
77:15 - whenever it comes on we just go like
77:18 - absolutely nuts it's our new mantra now
77:21 - and it's called honey but PI zero seven
77:25 - zero shake but zero seven zero shake um
77:29 - and I mean I don't know there's
77:32 - something about this song I gotta say
77:34 - it's this song as an investment it's six
77:36 - minutes and thirty seconds long but the
77:39 - more you listen to it it grows on you
77:41 - alright and just go and start listening
77:44 - to it and you you'll know what I'm
77:47 - talking about you'll enjoy it and once
77:51 - it's helpful email us and let us know
77:53 - that it was hopeful
78:02 - so I went 17 minutes above time for you
78:06 - guys because I did not we kept delaying
78:18 - the livestream is supposed to be like 2
78:20 - p.m. then we had to push it to 5 and
78:22 - then we have to push it to 6 thank you
78:24 - guys for still showing up so that's why
78:27 - I'm you know going above time we're
78:29 - supposed to be just hour exactly but I'm
78:32 - going above let me know is this has this
78:34 - been helpful and valuable to you so far
78:39 - somebody says hey honey 0:07 that's not
78:42 - it
79:12 - nice patty Pooh says I can answer that -
79:17 - found him right after I was laid off
79:19 - bored and watching beauty gurus on
79:21 - YouTube been following him since I have
79:24 - hope now awesome
79:26 - patty Pugh glad to hear that and guys
79:29 - here here's one thing I always say is
79:31 - just as easy to stay exactly where you
79:34 - are and it's just as easy to continue
79:36 - growing simple hacks that I have done to
79:40 - get a lot of results and I'm not saying
79:42 - I'm the best I'm not I'm not even a
79:43 - Python expert I just got I had mentors
79:47 - and I followed kind of the you know the
79:49 - right things quote-unquote that just
79:51 - gave me this giant big shortcuts and
79:54 - regardless of me lacking in school and
79:57 - being one of the worst students
79:58 - seriously like really low GPA terrible
80:01 - scores on my high school AC T's and yeah
80:05 - just and these were the things that
80:07 - helped me and some simple things I'll
80:09 - tell you now is it's just as easy to sit
80:11 - while you're eating food and watch
80:13 - stranger things or I don't know I forget
80:15 - what other shows are there sweet suits I
80:18 - always say house of court suits or
80:21 - office Game of Thrones yes thank you
80:24 - there we go it's just as easy to sit
80:27 - there and watch that as eating food and
80:30 - just watching something on Python and it
80:34 - you don't have to make it feel like it's
80:36 - some kind of thing that you have to do
80:38 - and if you don't do it it's like
80:40 - homework assignment it's like work just
80:42 - think of it like oh cool like sweet I
80:45 - get to learn this and right after I'm
80:47 - done eating food you know what I'm just
80:48 - gonna put together something for my
80:50 - friends it's gonna be hilarious it's
80:51 - gonna be an insult generator and it's
80:53 - gonna be hosted on here Okuda in Roku
80:55 - which lets you put your websites online
80:57 - and you could be like they could just go
81:00 - to it and type in and you know type in
81:02 - whatever or type in their name and it
81:04 - automatically generates an insult or
81:06 - maybe it automatically generates a
81:08 - compliment so they go to your little
81:10 - Python app that you made and they type
81:13 - in you know raffia qazi my name is Rafa
81:16 - kasi and it says Rafa cause you are
81:17 - awesome and then and if somebody else
81:20 - types it in you know clucks your Mostafa
81:21 - types it and he goes most of all it says
81:23 - most of
81:24 - you're great or must have a you rock but
81:27 - if you want to create an insult
81:28 - generator it could be like most of how
81:29 - you suck most of your horrible and it
81:31 - could just be hilarious
81:32 - so have fun and have these ideas that
81:35 - make you have fun with it and then
81:36 - you'll improve at the same time having
81:39 - fun and then you'll improve a lot faster
81:43 - it's like how animals learn they don't
81:46 - sit there like the tiger dad is not
81:50 - going like has a whiteboard and this is
81:52 - how you run this is how you hunt they
81:55 - just let the kids run around and have
81:56 - fun and then figure out how to do all
81:59 - that same way if you kind of learn
82:02 - football soccer or basketball instead of
82:05 - having a teacher sit there on chalkboard
82:07 - teaching you theory for also long just
82:10 - go out and kick the damn soccer ball
82:12 - have some fun with it
82:13 - try to do some tricks and mess up try to
82:16 - shoot shoot it in the hoop and mess up
82:18 - its who cares if your form is off who
82:20 - cares if you suck at dancing practice it
82:23 - improve and then when you watch the
82:24 - video you're like oh I'm connecting the
82:27 - dots it's fun and I could be building
82:30 - things as I go along I could be taking
82:31 - things things from my head and putting
82:33 - them out there into the real world that
82:35 - people could use that people could share
82:37 - and could not only be fun little games
82:40 - for my friends and family and for myself
82:41 - and inside jokes which is awesome but
82:44 - could also be something that could make
82:45 - an impact in the world could also be
82:48 - something that makes me money it could
82:50 - also be something that gets me that job
82:51 - that I've always wanted and could also
82:53 - be something that becomes my way of
82:55 - being able to travel and wake up
82:58 - whenever I want to and work from
83:01 - wherever I want to I just had a talk
83:03 - with one of the students from my older
83:05 - courses Opie courses his name is nazar
83:07 - Molly and he told me that he's a cg
83:12 - generalist freelancer and the reason why
83:15 - he loves freelancing for example is that
83:17 - he doesn't have to do a - he doesn't
83:19 - have to do a commute that saves him two
83:21 - hours so one cool thing is he can wake
83:24 - up and boom be at work so he's never
83:25 - late another cool thing is that he's a
83:29 - father and he gets to spend time with
83:31 - his little daughter he gets to see his
83:34 - daughter
83:35 - grow up he doesn't have to miss those
83:37 - moments with his
83:38 - daughter those special moments and
83:42 - that's invaluable I don't know about you
83:45 - but I can't put a price on it and that's
83:47 - what I mean when I talk about a rich
83:48 - life it's not just money but it's other
83:52 - things involved in there and then he
83:55 - went on to make $1200 using Python in
83:59 - four hours so after he took my course he
84:02 - built this thing that he could use to
84:04 - automate these graphics all right and he
84:09 - was telling me that it took the team in
84:11 - Brazil seven days to do this and it took
84:14 - him four hours to do the same thing and
84:15 - he charged the same as that entire
84:18 - Brazilian team charged and he pocketed
84:20 - $1,200 and got it done in four hours so
84:23 - think about that somebody who works as a
84:26 - as a graphic artist or you know somebody
84:29 - who is working on creating animations
84:31 - and graphics and videos gets to use
84:34 - Python to automate it so even whatever
84:37 - you're currently doing you can use it
84:39 - and it could be practical it could help
84:40 - you boost your income even if you love
84:41 - your job it could help you get that
84:43 - promotion maybe you're not ready to just
84:45 - leave your job and jump into Python
84:47 - which I get can be scary I had I read
84:49 - this comment by this girl I forget her
84:52 - name but basically she said I have a job
84:54 - I'm a single mom I have to take care of
84:56 - my son and I have to take care of myself
84:58 - so I can't just leave my job but I want
85:01 - to use Python to earn that side income
85:03 - you could be doing the same thing I get
85:06 - it some of us have a lot of
85:07 - responsibilities and we can't just jump
85:09 - the ship and burn the bridges and storm
85:11 - the boats we have to go one by one so
85:15 - why not integrate Python into your life
85:17 - to become more valuable at your job
85:19 - maybe get a raise if you can't do that
85:21 - maybe do some side projects on the
85:23 - weekends and if you put in ten hours at
85:26 - $50 an hour in one or two days you're
85:29 - bringing in two thousand dollars extra
85:31 - that's twenty four thousand dollars
85:32 - extra per year if you add on another
85:34 - client or you increase your rate all of
85:37 - a sudden you're bringing in three or
85:38 - four thousand dollars extra per month
85:40 - and now you could start to maybe think
85:42 - about changing from your current job and
85:44 - going Python you know all the way
86:05 - alright alright hopefully this was
86:09 - valuable and helpful for you guys
86:12 - we have went well above our time but
86:17 - again I hope that I was able to bring
86:18 - value I was able to be of service to you
86:21 - if you've loved this trust me just take
86:25 - my word for it
86:26 - the master class I've put together for
86:28 - you is gonna absolutely blow your socks
86:30 - off go in the description link click it

86:36 - and I've put together three amazing
86:37 - videos for you that can honestly change
86:40 - your entire life if you're interested in
86:42 - becoming a Python developer Python
86:44 - freelancer or looking to just use this
86:47 - to boost your side income these three
86:49 - videos will take you from literally zero
86:52 - coding skills to giving you the roadmap
86:53 - to becoming that freelancer or Python
86:55 - developer who lands his or her first
86:58 - client in less than 90 days and gets
86:59 - that paycheck so if you're on Facebook
87:02 - the link is in the description if you're
87:05 - on YouTube go ahead Klink click the link

87:48 - it's just these live streams are so
87:52 - tiring whoo thank you for the donation
88:10 - papa bar nice I think it was me jumping
88:14 - around this guy code you hadn't yet
88:18 - hilarious
88:20 - oh yeah but isn't YouTube gonna shut us
88:25 - down
88:26 - hey let's find some like no man let's

88:55 - videos we'll give you credit and
88:56 - everything and I think it'll be cool so
88:59 - email us at support at clever programmer
89:01 - calm and we'll do it no not $12 and one
89:10 - and a half hour but not bad I get to sit
89:13 - here and talk and you know it doesn't
89:16 - seem too hard monkey says I love your

90:45 - and YouTube and Facebook YouTube I'll
90:52 - see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

I'm video hey guys what's up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm we are live on Instagram YouTube Facebook this video we're gonna be covering a little bit more technical stuff related to Python okay so if you have been like hmm when does Kazi gonna teach us some more technical stuff don't worry today we're gonna talk a little bit about more technical things along with the soft skills that are needed okay some of the things that we're gonna be talking about is what is the best web development framework for Python okay what do those frameworks the developers who develop in those frameworks what did they get paid on average and we're gonna be talking about the best code editor for Python alrighty and I'm also gonna be looking at your guys's comments and checking them out do you for them yeah buddy cool cool cool yeah awesome got nobody on Facebook what's going on everybody's sleeping we got some people on Instagram hi Brina Jude what's going on here on YouTube let's check it out let's check it out dude I got a coop for programming all thanks to you what does that mean but I'm happy that happened Jillian Reynolds has nice shirt quasi thank you so much yes finally I'm not looking homeless I get it I also got a haircut I'm looking fresh on point for people who want to feed into my self validation and need for love just telling me that my haircut is looking on point which to be honest it is but it's still nice to read it and it's cause EQ azi I love you guys but you know please guys somebody just spelled my name correctly I get it spelled wrong so many times including the emails or it's written right on top it says Kazi and they're right quasi and then these people wonder why they're not getting the jobs or those interviews that they want details guys they matter pay attention to details it almost says hey man just got finished watching part 2 I love you I love you more Domo thank you and I'm happy that that helped you on point bro somebody says I'm this guy's neighbor that's weird I have a guess who it is the Pasha is that you Pasha are you watching this live stream oh maybe I should turn tone down this guy a little bit wait oh the gain gain is really down so maybe they can't even hear me and in this video we're also gonna be talking about how you can build your own Python freelance character and take your own skills up as a Python freelancer okay if you want to be a Python developer and work with a company or be a site hustler you're also welcome here I'm just gonna be focusing more on this freelancing part and I'm gonna be kind of talking more about that as well Larry says thank you so much love the portfolio guys the second video is out make sure in the description it lets them maybe know that a little bit but guys the second video the part two of the master class is live okay this master class is what shows you how you can become a Python developer in less than 90 days and get that first paycheck this master class is absolutely free and in the first master class we covered a lot of things like soft skills we covered just overall lots of things like for example your Python earning potential how much you could be looking to make okay so if you haven't watched the first one go watch it it's absolutely free and it's in the links in the descriptions below so go enjoy that and I have some other stuff for you guys let me just pull up some of my notes coolly okay make this half on this screen but a BAM bada boom well what did I press being a programmer and all I should really learn how to use my computer this goes here and this goes here and we are golden okay for people who are having trouble opening up the portfolio guys it's just like like literally you know I made it so you can doubleclick and open it or you can just go on and open a new file in Chrome if you're still having trouble google how to open an HTML file that's it just Google how to open an index.html file and Google will give you all your answers okay because in the second video we go over all of that okay so in the second video that got launched today I show you the number one secret to how you can become that developer in less than 90 days okay this is if you don't have degree you don't have money you don't have time and you don't have technical skills it works for all of you guys I also go over how I went from being a 2.0 GPA student and making $100,000 in one year and I kind of give you guys that as well okay so I give you how I did that while being a bad student so some of you guys can relate with that and it would help you knowing that you don't need to be smart enough and see that practical path that's also in there yeah we're gonna do the Q&A for a little bit but yet so the where this live stream where the idea kind of got conceptualized in my mind for this live stream which is I say build your Python freelance character is I remember when I was younger and I would play video games like Sims or like Skyrim or I used to play this one game called Dragon Age Origins and what what a lot of these games have in common is you have a character and whatever you do with this character you get these skill points and your guy becomes better and better in those particular skills so for example if you're playing a game like Dragon Age Origins and your guy is focusing on being a mage and he's doing spells or whatever or if your guy is being an archer or a swordsman whatever as you spend more time with those weapons or those things your guy levels up in those skills or take Sims where when your guy spends more time reading books he becomes better at reading more books and also he becomes more knowledgeable so now he can make new foods that he couldn't make before and he can do a lot of things he couldn't do before or for if he spends more time in the gym your characters get those skill points in the gym he starts getting better and then it takes him longer to get hungry and all that and there was a point in my life where I kind of loved games and then what happened to me was I kind of realized that if you spend time on yourself and you build up those skill points just in life it's kind of the same way even though there's no gamma fication happening you know you're the gooey bars are actually not building up and you can't go somewhere you don't get a notification for it right and when you log into life when you wake up you don't get a little notification that goes Boop you got a hundred points for sleeping on time and getting seven and a half hours of sleep you don't get a little notification for going to the gym today you don't get a little notification for being nice to your parents you don't get a notification for it getting your girlfriend a little gift and what starts to happen is when we don't have that instant gratification we look in other places those other places could be video games those other places could be things like drugs and alcohol and those other places could just be you know whatever like places where you're fine like Netflix you're watching stranger things you're watching house of cards you're binging on some anime you just found and that happens to us a lot and that happens to me at times too and as you compare what you're doing in those video games and in those movies and how the drugs and alcohol might make you feel with where you actually are in real life the contrast it kind of it hurts because one thing is so awesome and fun and instant gratification whereas this other thing you're getting farther and farther from your goals every day you're just sitting there like if I just started going to the gym I had that thought like seven years ago and I thought I was too old to go to the gym seven years ago and if I just done it what would I look like right now or you have that thought oh man I knew I could have done that job or started that business and now my friends doing it and look how well he's doing or I should have started a YouTube channel and look where that would have been now or I should have done this for that and look where that would have been now but then BOOM switch let's watch some stranger things baby let's watch some house of cards let's watch some Fargo forget about everything else and we kind of get caught up in that but here's a cool thing if you can if you can get over that instant gratification thing a little bit and not getting those little notifications in life and you start to really focus every day you take 10 to 15 minutes analyzing where you are your own life is kind of like being that video game character if you spend more time dealing with tough tough conversations maybe you're at work at whatever your current job is and you go in to ask for that promotion it feels uncomfortable your how it hearts pounding your hands are shaking you're sweating whoo scary right but when you go and do it and you get through it and maybe you get that promotion what just happened your skill points improved in negotiation and now you could use those skill points at other jobs isn't it freaking cool like after you kind of realize that why do you need to play Skyrim you kind of don't what happens when you put some time into going to the gym after a little bit weeks you know a few weeks you'll start to see some results and now you're putting points into your own physical fitness and getting better your character in real life is getting better and guess what when you put that controller away the character doesn't go away it's still there with you forever if the lights go out and the game ends or the hard drive crashes and all your saves are gone it doesn't matter because that character is you and that's there forever that doesn't run out of batteries if you spend time coding like Python for example or whatever language and you're coding you're building your coding skills tree you're becoming a better developer and if you spend time doing this and you're building cool projects it literally feels just like playing a game except you might be making six figures doing it isn't that nice now contrast that with playing video games watching stranger things abusing drugs and alcohol and sitting in your mom's basement versus playing this other game called being a developer web development working on projects I feel literally like a game except it's like a glitch in life and people are paying you money money for it and at the end of the day you have something to show for it and you're doing this from a nice apartment overlooking a lake or something I don't know whatever it is that you like to overlook maybe you could be overlooking dumpsters that's your thing I don't know I don't know that is something that excites me these skills if you work on them on your own in real life when everything else goes to these skills are there with you forever they're there with you to stay there with you and you're getting money as a benefit as a bonus and now you can not only support yourself but your family you also don't have to feel like you're you don't have confidence you also don't have to feel like you have that lack of control in life because doing these things and working on yourself gives you that control in life okay so this is something important to keep in mind as you move forward now what we're gonna do is we're gonna talk a little bit about web development and the differences between different frameworks okay so we're gonna get a little bit technical and we're going to talk about Python again in the meantime I'm going to look at some of your guys's what you guys are saying maybe some comments maybe some questions and kind of answer that no questions so far not too many questions I am looking for some questions that I can ask for you guys or answer for you guys can you make neural network tutorial for beginners using Python yes I will be making I will be doing some stuff with machine learning later on not at this moment in time because I'm focusing more on web development with Python but don't worry this is something that excites the hell out of me so I will be doing some neural network stuff and I'm gonna be bringing on best developers in the world on this channel and they're either gonna be helping me build some kind of awesome curriculum for you guys or literally I'm gonna have them make some videos for you guys too so AI or whatever it is that you guys want to learn not a problem here's what I urge everybody to do right now I'm gonna give you like 20 seconds as I go through these q and A's have a pen paper with you because the things that we're gonna be talking about are extremely valuable you don't want to miss them okay I would share the slides with you but again I'm on three different live platforms so I have to respect that because if I share the slides with everybody on YouTube if Instagram doesn't see that and if I share something on Facebook YouTube and Instagram doesn't see that so I have to respect all that so guys go get a piece of paper pen whatever and write these things down because they're gonna be very valuable to you as time Prague makes progress okay so there are two big frameworks in Python but before we talk about framework let's talk about web development in general okay web development has to do with developing things on the web everything you see online and the main one of the main things I want to kind of touch on is web sites versus web apps okay or basically like solutions to problems so regular web sites I want you to think of like imagine I don't know your regular contact me pages your restaurant web sites that are super boring and just I don't know have like static stuff on it you can't really do much there just go just read their menu that's really yet or it maybe has some dudes phone number and you can call them or email somebody that's your static website but those things you can build in WordPress or Squarespace if you guys are not familiar with these open another tab and type this in so you can learn or write these down so you can learn them later you actually don't open and there are other tabs right now I want you guys to pay attention right here to me and just write this down and then later you can open up other tabs and do this okay so WordPress is basically like a pointandclick build a website Squarespace is a pointandclick build a website thing wakes and Weebly similarly those things people don't pay you a lot for those are commodities you can have 12 year old learn it very quickly and and also a lot of those are outsourced and there are a lot of people that can do them ok so any skill that's easy to do you're not gonna get paid for ok but a skill that takes a lot of time and is difficult you're gonna get paid for it and quite a bit because it's hard to replace you like right now and think about this where you are working how easy do you think it is to replace you if the answer is pretty easy then it probably also makes sense what you're getting paid right so if you think you're getting paid some low income and then you think that it's not that hard to replace you put the two and two together and the reason why you're probably making a lower income is cuz that it's easier to replace you but now as you start to get more specialized and as you learn more skills it's harder to replace you okay so generic websites that you can build with web web wordpress or whatever they're not too hard to do so you don't get paid much for it but the things that you do get paid for is for example and I'm gonna use big company name so it you guys can tie that in your head but most of the times when you're starting out you don't have to work with these big companies you can get started with a lot smaller companies that are under the radar and are trying to get their foot off the ground and get going but with the things that you get paid for is for example like Spotify is a music streaming problem and if you can solve it that's something you can get paid for so that's like a web app how about Domino's right where you can go and it'd be really boring if the pizza is just pictures of them were there and you just had to call them and order something but it's pretty dynamic you have to click on it you can order you can increase your order you can change your order when when you're in their app when you put mushrooms on your pizza you can choose if you want to put half on one side and half on the other you can choose what's your quantity you can delete and you can remove so for all of those things and being able to add that functionality that's a solution to a burning problem and the developers that got hard hire to do that would get paid a lot same thing with snapchat there's a huge networking problem there to fix how do you have all these people in the world sending each other pictures it goes fast it doesn't crash and our website and they're able to send pictures and videos like instantly boom boom boom how do you do that without your servers being overloaded right and here's a word I'm gonna give you guys it's called crud so write that down that's one of the things you have to know about as a web developer and be able to do pretty fast crud c ru D in caps so if you guys are here write that in comments and also write that you call caps crud and then I'm gonna tell you guys what it stands for okay so write that down on your notes and once you guys write this down on your notes or your hands I don't really care write this down then let me know say something like three I don't know three yeah number three just say three once you write it down it'd be better if I just add them say crud cool crud means read it means create just making sure you guys are paying attention it means create read update and delete okay for things I don't know why I do it like I'm in Germany in United States we do it like this for but I think it's just cooler when I do when I do three like this I think it's really cool so I'm gonna keep doing it but that's what that means okay crud create read update delete write that down next to you on a piece of paper preferably and what that has to do with is I'll give I'll give you examples of where it's applied when you're when you're in Domino's app and you're trying to create an order for those of you guys who don't know dominoes dominoes is a company that delivers pizzas this off the pizza problem okay when you create a order for a pizza that's what part of the crud I'm now gonna quiz you guys as you guys watch this live stream when you create the pizza what part of crud do you think that is is it the see is that the or is it the U or the D what mines are taking them so long okay good Eric cool thank you for being the cool one yes good a gamer's pro tube he says who doesn't know Domino's you'd be surprised because for one you misspelled Domino's my friend I think you're talking about the Domino's game Domino's Pizza spelled differently legendary nerd laughs some people say I want to ate now roasted live on clever programmer calm that's what happens to being tried to roast other people get your get your own game in check or anyway sorry got off tangent okay that's the create part now what about being able to let's say you put that order but now you want to change that order okay now you want to make that order something different what part of the crud do you think that is when you've already created the order but now before hitting checkout you're like I don't want pepperonis on my pizza I just want some green peppers and jalapenos what part of crud is that good that's the update part all right and before I go further for those of you guys are like what are we doing web developers get paid a hundred and ten thousand dollars a year and believe it or not this is one of the things that is massively helpful and right now I know I'm having you just like kind of learn it and regurgitate and memorizing it was like oh it doesn't make sense but I promise you right after we're done with this I'm gonna kind of give you examples I'm gonna be giving examples of it and this is this is gonna be one of those things that saves you years of your time and also helps you now it's researchable for you so you can actually look at online tutorials be able to do this and get those jobs that pay you a lot and you don't need years of experience to get these web development jobs like in my PLC or my video part two of the master class okay that got launched it's called why most programmers are broke in that one I also share with you what things I was working on and what client paid me twenty thousand one hundred and seventy three dollars and thirty cents for two months of work and it was pretty much just me knowing crud and working on it so now let's continue forward so you guys know you guys have it in your mind why this can be actually really important helpful for you all right now when I am let's say let's just do last one and this is so obvious if I don't want my pizza anymore I'm just angry I don't like I just call Domino's service and that lady just didn't have the right attitude she just pissed me off rubbed me the wrong way and I'm like all right all bets are off and I go and I hit X on that order what part of the crud did I just do yeah oh god damn it was closed sweet good job you guys know your stuff patty that's hilarious patty poo says I do that all the time delete nice that's one of my friends too he always made YouTube videos of guitar and he deleted them and he would have had millions of views but instead he has zero views on his guitar channel yep good job guys it's the delete part so if I delete my order I've deleted so again crud create read update and delete okay and lastly I want to give you an example of the read part what if you have ordered your pizza but you don't know what the heck you ordered and then you go click view order what part of crud is that create read update delete what part of the crud is that you being able to go oh what the heck where what what pizza did i order you know clicking that view button boom man you guys are legends some people say we're lost it's okay if you're lost you just have to probably watch the stream a little bit back but just to keep you uptodate if you're new right if you just enter the stream right now we're talking about web development and how in web development there's something very big concept called crud and Sanford create read update and delete and now I'm giving examples of Domino's a big company like Domino's uses crud a company like Spotify users crud for example if I want to add a music to the playlist maybe that creates a new music in my playlist so that's create if I click on it that gives me goes into it that's read and if I want to maybe shuffle it I don't know that's like updating it and if I want to remove it from my playlist that's delete okay same way with Netflix same way with YouTube every all of these apps can be pretty much summed up with one word if you want to call it crud okay that's what we're talking about and right now we're just quizzing everybody live on crud and making them understand the concept of this looking at comments just whoa nice okay awesome Tomo is now the moderator of the chat because he bribed us first with some with some super chats no not just kidding he he's doing a good job with the chat wow that's really cool I didn't even know you can make moderators well welcome Domo yeah so crud is love okay so for again for those you guys are new write these things down best development frameworks in Python there's Django and then there's flask write that down I'm gonna come back to that point okay what we're talking about is the big picture view of web development we're talking about how much Python web developers get paid so according to indeed.com if you look at it right now average Django Python developer makes a hundred and ten thousand and six hundred and ten dollars every single year and one of the key concepts their entire job could be summarized in is with one word crud okay so say it with me what the crud I get paid one hundred and ten thousand dollars a year for crud what the crud it's crazy so if you've written down crud if you've written down Django if you've written out flasks all these things you guys can research later also Python web developers and how much they make you could research later we've talked about WordPress and Squarespace being able to build boring sites but Python can help you build web apps okay that can provide solutions these are not things that you can just do in Squarespace and you know pointandclick these are things that you have to use real powerful programming languages for to solve problems things problems with things like Dropbox cloud storage problem solved with Python YouTube video sharing problem solved with Python I've already talked about Spotify reddit a social network for sharing links and threads and I don't even know it's very complicated for me a reddit was a social problem solved with Python Instagram similarly a photo sharing problem solved with Python so you can see that these massive companies are using it Google a search engine problem solved with Python okay so you have to build really custom solutions for it and ultimately again it comes down to crud alright it comes down to kind of one thing and crud is all over in games as well when you're playing video games okay when your character creates a new weapon then being able to see that weapon you click view weapon if you want to then add a little bit of firepower to that weapon so it increases its damage that's what you know be thinking about it so as I ask you just quickly in your mind just be active don't just sit there passively watching it just breathing because if you're just breathing and watching why even beyond the stream you're not getting anything out of it okay so I want to respect you and your time so that's why I tell you to actively learn and as I ask you questions just be quick and be right there have your pen and paper and just write down answers to everything I'm saying kind of like I'm right there with you okay alright what did I just say do you remember I lost my train of thought I got it games right okay so when you add magic to your weapon that's the update part all right and then when you maybe don't want that weapon anymore you don't want that shield anymore you that's the delete part so keep thinking about crud as you're going through life and be looking at things like that because that's another thing that can be helping you build that can be helping you build your own Python freelance character okay you're building the skill points so maybe in your skill tree you have Jango and as you put more time into Jango and build that skill tree right then maybe you learn about things like crud along that Jango tree or that flask tree and you become more and more valuable getting yourself closer to being able to land those jobs that pay you a hundred and ten thousand dollars a year oh look at this proof I went to you told me to show this right proof I went to Oakland Community College look at this it's showing correctly here oh look how a mustache my pen so if you guys are enjoying this so far give me a hell yeah before I continue because if you guys are not super chatting me and paying me money on YouTube you guys got to give me something so I continue let's keep this right here and I just monster has to sponsor me at some point and pay me for this yeah okay good good good good this is awesome man I love these guys could be here like I wish that we could just be in like the seminar place and then I could just like help everybody I'd just be running around be like boom boom boom boom boom and helping you guys build your things Hudson says I love your face no Hudson I love your face more my friend okay so if you sounds like you guys are loving this I want to pause for a moment before I continue again a lot of these things I go into deep in my profitable programmer masterclass which I just launched this class is absolutely free okay free2go and part two is called why the best programmers are broke and then part two again I show you how you can become a Python developer in less than 30 days if you have no time no money no degree and you feel like you're old or whatever and I'm just saying these things so people who jump into the livestream now they know where to go and what to do okay in this part 2 training series you know training video in my profitable programmer training I also go over how I made one hundred and four thousand dollars as a Oakton Community College student and apparently I have this pen too which is cool cuz just proof for you guys mmm not that I know you guys believe me but just want to throw it in there for those of you guys for luck and I go through that and I also show you guys literally my behindthescenes code some of it that I used to build this Python app okay for that client who paid me $20,000 for two months of work less than two months of work and I got that client in 90 days of me going from zero coding skills knowing nothing about coding knowing not a single line of code to then landing this client in 90 days and then making 20k with this client and then going on to make 100k that one year okay that was my first year I started to code and that was my year yeah I was doing Python freelancing so if that's something that interests you right now pause what you're doing open a new tab click the link below it's called clever programmer 2 slash master class followed by whatever and it'll take you right to the master class so you can sign in sign up for it and then as the three videos that are supposed to get launched they're gonna get sent right to you also in the second video also in this second video I'm gonna be giving you your portfolio as a for a Python freelancer it's built specially for Python freelancers that you can literally download okay and steal from me and then what you can do is it has a my work section so as you continue your journey as a Python freelancer you can plug and chug your Python projects in this portfolio so I'm gonna be just giving away a full on portfolio again by itself this would be like a hundred or two hundred dollar course but I'm giving that portfolio away to you guys for free I'm also sharing the behindthescenes code for those of you guys who have missed part one of the training big mistake but it's still up all of these training videos are up for a limited time until I take them down but in part one we cover a lot of things a lot of things what do we cover so in part one like my friend said we show you your Python earning potential and we have put together a calculator for you that can show you what your earning potential for as a Python freelancer would be like okay so for example say that you got one client at $50 an hour you work with that client for ten hours and write this math down to because I'm gonna go through it fast because I've went through it in my last live stream but you again I'm gonna start again fifty dollars an hour you work with this client for ten hours a week and that's one of the lowest rate you can charge the Python freelancer week one you make five hundred dollars and in monthly you make two thousand dollars and yearly from that one client you make twenty four thousand dollars two thousand dollars pays for all this extra stuff phone bills Netflix Hulu whatever office rental stuff car insurance dental insurance I don't know whatever and the twenty four thousand dollars you could be using to start a new startup or put in 401k or Charles Schwab or make that investment you've always wanted to make extra income does not hurt and I help you calculate your Python earning potential by giving you the calculator you could literally steal and download and then also I have a worksheet for you that helps you figure out your Python freelancer lifestyle again all of that is for free unbelievable I can't even believe I give you guys all the stuff for free so just go and take advantage of it all right please would you do that for me if you're here go ahead and do that link is in the description on Facebook the link is in bio on Instagram and link is in description on YouTube now with that shameless plug being out of the way let's continue moving forward okay Sheldon here's what I want you to do on YouTube I see you say when I load the profitable programmer portfolio I only get plain HTML I want you to email us I'm not gonna announce what the email is because then this YouTube video gets launched in the sly stream gets washed and everybody just emails us at once go to my website clever programmer calm at the bottom hit continue to website and then go to the contact page get our email from there and then send me an email and I'll personally get on a call with you and I'll help you figure out how to put that portfolio together for yourself Sheldon okay also for those other people that might be going through the same problem don't take the index.html file out of the folder everybody this is for the people who went through part two of my training which is called why most programmers are broke and in there I let you download a portfolio app that's built specially for Python freelancers and when you open them that portfolio you literally have it you've just stolen it from me like this and I have video instructions on how to copy it but if you take out that index.html file that I gave you in the folder and put it somewhere else and then double click and open it it'll kind of give you wrong stuff meaning it'll give you only a plain HTML file without CSS there meaning the styling so think of it like a human without clothes hTML is like a person without clothes was just naked and then the CSS part the cascading style sheet is what gives you that style puts on that clothing and makes you look good okay so you're still a person meaning your website still exists with HTML you still have links and you have you know words on it but it looks really boring and it doesn't look interesting and it just creeps people out but then when you ask CSS to it then it makes people feel comfortable and actually enjoy spending time on that website okay man we are making some dough for making some money on YouTube man all right monkey says how much money doesn't create apps course cost monkey two three one six again I want you to go to my website hit continue to website go to contact email us it's email us and I will tell you exactly how much the course cost just for you okay if I am on the live stream and if I say how much the course cost if this video is being used later and the course price has changed whether it's down or up it will just confuse the heck out of people so I don't want to do that to people and confuse them I want this video to be up there forever and give value to everybody okay so make sure you go to my website and you email us and what the hell I'll just say it it's support a clever programmer calm okay just email us there I don't care how many people email us there will reply back to most of you it's hard to reply back to everybody cuz there's just so many people but we promise we'll try to get back to every single one of you whatever questions you have so monkey 3 2 1 6 thank you for the donation and we are gonna answer your question alright Tiffany and Smith says I want to help clients generate leads creating custom quizzes is Python the best language for this ok Tiffany I actually have experience with generating leads with creating custom quizzes with Python and without Python here's what I'm gonna tell you if your job requires you to know programming and build this with Python and integrate this with Python then yes Python would be a very good choice to make this happen but if you're just looking to help your clients generate leads so then you become a more profitable consultant or they pay you more and you become that trusted advisor you don't have to do this task on your own you can use an amazing service like typeform comm or you can use Survey Monkey comm to create custom quizzes and qualify leads essentially okay I assume that's what you're trying to do right you're trying to ask your leads if Tiffany asks a question in here just let me know in the stream but basically what you're trying to do I assume is help your clients qualify the leads that they're getting and make sure that they're good leads right these are people who actually will not waste the time of your clients so something like typeform calm is great it was awesome for me when I was trying to get oneonone students for clever programmer and work with them oneonone and do mentoring now I don't do as much mentoring I've pretty much I haven't been doing oneonone mentoring for a while because I want to provide content to all of the students so that's why I've kind of stopped but I was using type form for that hopefully that answers your question Tiffany but again if you want to use something with Python look into Django and you'll be able to put together custom quizzes fairly easily look on Stack Overflow and now point you in the right direction thank you for the $5 donation yeah qualified leads from social ads I figured yeah cool Glenn says I would like to do a CRM project awesome Glenn you can use Python for a CRM project as well I in my part two video why best programmers are bro or my most programmers were broke I literally show you again that app that I made and I show you some behind the scenes code and that AB that client paid me twenty thousand dollars for that app is actually made with that app I made and the project was on CRM so I built a customer relationship management system for my clients and I give you guys a little sneak peek of the work that I did and some of the work that was involved this last teams livestream song is pretty cool I like answering technical questions it's me going also it's probably the monster Matt you're welcome hey guys um on YouTube or wherever who was able to download the portfolio and it worked well for them just say what should we have them say he always my friend all this comes up with one okay so say one if you were able to download that portfolio and it worked well for you also I'm scared my live stream might die on Instagram let's just check it out 9% keep it reminding me to check it out okay so monkey just monkey monkey three two one six just emailed us so just respond back and let's see what's going on here okay yeah alright so for people it worked for some people it did not work somos thank you so much for moderating the chats he says he has school tomorrow yeah thank you thank you thank you and you did a great job Tomo enjoy your school somebody says 0.5 why couldn't you download it Naruto yeah it's supposed to show you the final file and in that final file when you click it's a folder when you click in it it has index.html come here dude just so they can see your face your face looks on point they want to see you from now they're gonna think I'm crazy and I'm just talking to myself just say hi to them they miss you there we go that's my boy Mustapha goes by Clark Co CLU X I owe Glen link is in the description my friend so go ahead and do that guys just go go through the video I've put together for you that will help you get the portfolio alright anyways now let's talk a little bit about Python frameworks so there are two big frameworks Jango and flask like I've mentioned here are my recommendations flask is pretty simple but the problem is that okay let's just talk about quickly what a framework is so if you were to do web development Python you would have to pull out your hair not because of Python Python is awesome but because web development you'd have to write all your own code but if you use a framework with Python like flask the benefit of that is that it does all the big heavy lifting for you that you don't have to worry about anymore so creating servers and making things go online on a website okay make other people be able to see your website it's super easy you can do it with just a few lines of code flask is super light weight again as I'm talking write these things down flask is pretty lightweight and it's cool but the problem is because it's too lightweight sometimes it's you have to write a lot of code to make things work whereas Django is a little bit more advanced looking and can be confusing sometimes but it's what we call batteries included and it comes with a lot of libraries a lot of big things juicy meaty things built in there so think of it like bunch of developers who gave up and had sleepless nights God probably divorces because it works so hard and like got huge eye bags writing all this code and creating this amazing thing for you and now you can just steal it with just a few lines of code and use it okay so think of it think of Django like that and you could build things pretty quickly so me I'm personally more a fan of your mic is too good I can hear you gulping down what are you drinking I'm drinking monster and I did not know you guys could hear me gulp okay somebody just said can we see more cluck Co I don't know guys do you guys want to see more of cluck Co how much would that ya type one all was his idea to type one how much would that suck if they're all like none of us want to see you like they just start typing zero oh yeah we should do that have you delirious yeah create apps and land your first climb with Python course it will be prerecorded but you'll get each piece of content like a week from now like every week essentially oh man oh man Akash Renaldo all right you heard him this is what they want somebody just says a child's kids yell okay come on in bro what's up everybody how you guys doing clicks you back again welcome back to Ghazis livestream all right click Co so talk about some technical Python stuff and help I will not be able to answer any of those questions but uh if you guys need some photography help YouTube help I got you guys yeah he's just a pretty face for this live stream we both got our like haircuts today I was looking on point my hair is kind of messed up right now yeah I didn't gel it up or anything but straight out of the shower we are looking fresh yeah yeah this guy's been like my brother we we became friends when dude like when we were 10 years old like 10 years old I heard those of you guys who don't know hilarious okay sorry guys all right inappropriate back to the live stream about I I was born in Pakistan and I was born in a very very very small city that most of people don't even know exists its called Peshawar and every time I say that to people they're like ha ha pshh our like a pee shower I always get a kick out of it and he was born in Pakistan as well but he was he's from Karachi okay so literally everybody who comes to united states from Pakistan it's not like two cities okay its Karachi and Islamabad and that's pretty much it every other city nobody makes it out of there and you know nobody does they're all just stay in Pakistan even though to try to come to America I came here at the age of nine and then I met him about when I was ten years old and then we we have known each other since then so it's been a long journey I'm now 23 years old and yeah we used to be like little tiny babies and we used to make these stupid videos and now we grew older and we still are little tiny babies that make stupid videos except now we just have beards oh yeah that's literally the only difference 30 year long time friends damn yeah they know we were that old no no not 30 okay fine I'm not gonna I'm from Kazakhstan exactly it's pretty much the same thing as long as none mean it's just a little spelling difference Wow pom pom laughing emoji love the glasses mine or cozies I'm from India cool cool I'm it's not such a small it's not such a small city Lahore Aslam but I'm from India cool cool pretty cool the shower can now be called a small city grew up in Chicago all right okay so oh we're going offline on Instagram I want to give you value before Instagram goes offline okay so I have one minute and 20 something seconds okay give a round of applause to cluck Co so send the clapping emoji okay so web development django developers make about a hundred and ten and dollars a year jingle is my more preferred framework it's a little bit advanced but if it's taught to you the right way you can pick it up fast and then you don't have to look back jingo is my preferred way to go write that down second best text editors or coding editors for python so there are a lot of them there is sublime text there is at hum and then there is PyCharm sublime text and atom you can use interchangeably sublime text that annoying thing is it keeps asking for purchase whereas atom is completely free so you guys can just download atom to write your code in pie chart is my personal favorite IDE or let's just simplify and say coding editor it's my favorite but I would recommend you guys to get into pycharm around the second or third month mark of your coding because it is a little bit more technical and it is a little bit more advanced and in the start it might confuse you more than it helps you because of how big it is but again is just a few practical things you need to know and then boom boom boom you're all caught up look at this how many collapse you're getting all right oh damn it I couldn't give my outro to San Instagram it's okay Instagram still knows we love them ok just saving it and then I'm gonna hit share um coo coo coo coo coo cool alright so for someone who wants to enter into web dev what would you advise them Jango seems challenging with their setups and admin Django is honestly pretty simple to get started with just the starting part is sometimes tricky but once you get past a little bit of starting time it's pretty easy to build things up really fast with Django so again I'm a huge fan of Django but if you have extra time in your life learn a little bit of flask maybe spend a week learning flask and that will show you the things you need to be doing with web development and how you're doing them because you're gonna be writing each line of code yourself you'll get a good grasp what the heck is going on and then when you do them in Django you'll just be like oh it's just like this thing I did in Flast except it's easier now and it won't confuse you okay so that's really it and let's put this or actually I'm sorry I'll just do it okay got it see easy PC selfie stick guys this is awesome by the way boom you can increase it boom like this then it has this remote the Bluetooth so you can press this button to take a picture you can change it landscape or portrait mode for your phone and this Bluetooth thing it's like a remote and it even comes out and then you could put this far away and you could take a picture and then last thing I didn't show you guys this is pretty cool you get actually it has a little tripod and boom you could put it on the table you know and then set it up and there you go and it's very compact once you pack it up looks like this man I should be doing some affiliate marketing all right yeah free advertising unfortunately but feel free to super chat me on YouTube so if you super chat me and pay me money I will love you and I will answer I answer everybody's question but I might go deeper into your question but just make sure it's a good question unfortunately I'm not getting paid to advertise that but I should be um Elias says do you play any video game if so which ones I used to play a lot of video games and love them but again as the title of the stream which has build your own Python freelance character what I realized was my life was like a game and if I built points I could stay with them and they don't like leave you when you end the game and that's when it hit me and I just stopped playing video games and like before I would guilt myself and be like why am I having just a conversation I'm talking about when I was young like twelve thirteen and I'd be like what am I talking with people I could be spending this time in the video game and my character would be leveling off now we're now about to play a video game I'm like why am I gonna level up my character in a video game when I could be leveling up my character in real life me and building those skill points up so now when I closed the game the character is still there and when I sleep and wake up the character is still there and if my hard drive is lost or my playstation is broken or my xbox is broken or my computer is broken or the lights go on out in my house the character is still there and then in life I just had to decide which character I was gonna be building and at some point I was like okay you know Python freelancing from a courier situation I was trying to do IT absolutely hated it and then I'm like okay I'm not gonna be building IT character I hate that freaking character and then I found Python and then in Python I found freelancing and I'm like okay I'm gonna be building a Python freelancing character and boom boom boom let's go and that's when I really stopped playing games laughs hilarious Rose shraddha says Kazi level 23 yes geo says what's your skills besides Python and Django absolutely none I'm useless don't really know anything just get by with luck okay other skills I couldn't see any question so I guess it's time to brag bring out the big guns not really but other skills you kind of have to know as a developer they're not that many but and you can learn them as you go and they're kind of interchangeable and mixed together okay so for example I know multiple skills so when you know Python and you know Django there's some other things that you end up learning along the way without even trying so html/css that's one of those things you end up learning okay maybe you can learn other tools like JavaScript okay and we'll get more into that and maybe later actually in the next livestream I'll talk about api's all right I'll talk about api's I'll talk about HTML and CSS and how it all connects with Python I'm taking these notes so I could talk about this and um got to take them faster actually have a better idea why don't I do things that you guys want instead of coming up with my own things which I'm pretty good at but you guys are better at it because you know what you want more than I do so in the comments for the next livestream why don't you guys tell me what I should cover and what you guys would like to know and if those things were good maybe I'll go over them in the next livestream and just keep looking at the chat whenever you get a chance so we know what things cuz sometimes what happens is we close out and then the last chat goes away and we lose everything oh yeah that's a good one front end back end I forgot yeah that's a good one front end talk about backend frontend backend and full stack Jesus okay I also don't want to overwhelm you guys with too much in one so I'm gonna be trying to give you one tip after another and I'm gonna be trying to go live every single day so don't miss out and before I continue forward again guys all of this and more I've put together the profitable programmer masterclass for you so you can learn all of these things and more get your first client in less than 90 days get that first paycheck with Python so go in the link click it and then sign up for the master class I've put together three amazing powerful lifechanging videos for you guys in there that will guide you through from what the hell is going on what is web development how much can you be earning what's sure Python earning potential all the way through giving you portfolios that you can literally download and steal learning potential calculators that you can steal and use for yourself so you can figure out what you'll be earning as a Python freelancer along with the roadmap that you can follow to become that Python developer slash freelancer slash somebody who wants to do it as a side hustle or work for big companies in less than 90 days okay without needing a degree without needing any experience without needing any technical skills and without your age being you're in high school or you're about to retire okay so go in the links right now in the description and get on my master class the profitable program or master class it's in the description on Facebook and it's in the description click the link on YouTube and do it now okay that's a good one Julian asks how the hell to use github and she says it with two exclamation marks okay so we're gonna be going into that in the next few days so keep out be on the lookout monkey says when can you where can you make websites for people for money monkey I love since I love you so much upwork.com is one place to look at but then there are other problems that arise like how do you land a client on up work how do you come up with the job proposal what kind of jobs you have the skills to do now or what kind of job skills you could be looking to do in the next week or two and how to prepare for them so there are a lot of problems that arise but if you are ready and you want to just look at it and you're interested go to upward calm and just type in Python jobs okay that will tell you what kind of jobs you could be doing but again these are things that I'm gonna be helping you guys go through step by step and that's my goal to help you get that client and know what framework or what system or what roadmap to follow to be able to do that and get past all those problems Patti Pugh says I would like to know how much if any sequel is used in relation to Python when you use flask you have to know quite a bit of sequel but if you use Django there's something called an ORM there is an ORM in flask as well and it's called it stands for an object relational relation mapper okay so an object relation mapper ORM write this down but this won't be important for you till maybe a few weeks into your web development start working with databases okay this was something that I don't know why the hell nobody's explained on the Internet and it took me literally like so long to figure out how to make apps and put them together and make them come to life so for you I'm gonna be saying this and write this down again when you use an ORM you really don't know you don't have to know how to use sequel and you could be using Django and sequel in and as one so python is sequel as one and ORM lets you combine the two without having to know sequel too much sequel but obviously having the knowledge of it would help you Hadj edge amamiya asks your class enough or have to follow other courses my class will give you the roadmap my course that's coming out midnovember will give you the exact howto and all the code and everything that goes along with it and that will be enough for you to go from doing zero Python to having apps and having portfolios having the tools and the skill set you need to land your first client and that course will help you land your first client in less than 90 days okay that's the goal of that course along with I'm gonna be interviewing people from places like uber and Google and people who might even have made codecademy and I'm gonna try to interview the best fulltime Python developers I'm gonna try to interview the best freelance Python developers Python freelancers and I'm gonna try to put it in a vault for you guys so you guys can also get those interviews and those will be massively valuable Cassandra Blackman says will there be any discussion and how to negotiate pay with people who want to hire you absolutely in the PLC videos I will be covering some of that and my course will go in a lot of detail about this my course will be a lot different because of that 85% of your financial success guys comes from your likability or negotiation skills your commune education skills 15% of it comes from technical knowledge I'm not saying technical knowledge is bad what I am saying is if you want to be able to comfortably support yourself get paid what you deserve travel spend time and your family maybe even be able to support your family and be able to do that as fast as possible you have to put you know when you're building a Python freelancer characters skill tree you want to put those skill points in places that get you paid the fastest okay and have you doing practical things and working on projects and working with companies the fastest and those are the skills I want to give you negotiation is a big big big skill and we're gonna be talking about that so you can learn it and you don't have to worry about it anymore throughout the video someone keeps coughing is another CP team getting sick don't worry too hard guys don't worry guys we drink we drink airborne and that helps us stay on sick actually immune and makes us a mute all right should I continue watching live or watch part 2 if you're here sign up right now to the master class and start watching the second video watch the first video and watch the second video they're both very important and they're tied together if you just skip ahead to two you're gonna miss out on what the heck is going on and my friend just put the link in below so go ahead and click that link and join it Elias says I'm a community college student I major in civil engineering but I'd be recently huh I've you recently started to become interested into programming any advice watch and take online courses that might be free so you can just kind of get the idea of it and then if you're interested invest in some courses good quality courses but work on practical skills okay also try to find mentors in real life so places like meetup groups or helpful all right but in the start in the absolute start I want you to spend more time playing and building fun things rather than going through tutorial after tutorial like you have some kind of purpose and burning yourself out so if you're starting out my advice is have fun doesn't matter if it takes you like you know a month or like 15 days to make a simple I don't know age calculator app it doesn't matter what matters is you have fun as you go along you feel like you did it on your own you gain that confidence and you enjoy it you have your full lifetime ahead of you to get better alright and I'll show you guys hacks to get better faster my whole thing is getting fast better faster in months and not years alright and that's what I want to help you do I want to help you become Python developers and freelancers in months and not years zakir says young savage while you trapping so hard well you got a 12 car garage but only got six cars and then I love that song if you guys are here on this live stream right down this is another important note Rockstar I love that song so much and then there's another song that really grew on the entire clever programmer team and whenever it comes on we just go like absolutely nuts it's our new mantra now and it's called honey but PI zero seven zero shake but zero seven zero shake um and I mean I don't know there's something about this song I gotta say it's this song as an investment it's six minutes and thirty seconds long but the more you listen to it it grows on you alright and just go and start listening to it and you you'll know what I'm talking about you'll enjoy it and once it's helpful email us and let us know that it was hopeful so I went 17 minutes above time for you guys because I did not we kept delaying the livestream is supposed to be like 2 p.m. then we had to push it to 5 and then we have to push it to 6 thank you guys for still showing up so that's why I'm you know going above time we're supposed to be just hour exactly but I'm going above let me know is this has this been helpful and valuable to you so far somebody says hey honey 007 that's not it nice patty Pooh says I can answer that found him right after I was laid off bored and watching beauty gurus on YouTube been following him since I have hope now awesome patty Pugh glad to hear that and guys here here's one thing I always say is just as easy to stay exactly where you are and it's just as easy to continue growing simple hacks that I have done to get a lot of results and I'm not saying I'm the best I'm not I'm not even a Python expert I just got I had mentors and I followed kind of the you know the right things quoteunquote that just gave me this giant big shortcuts and regardless of me lacking in school and being one of the worst students seriously like really low GPA terrible scores on my high school AC T's and yeah just and these were the things that helped me and some simple things I'll tell you now is it's just as easy to sit while you're eating food and watch stranger things or I don't know I forget what other shows are there sweet suits I always say house of court suits or office Game of Thrones yes thank you there we go it's just as easy to sit there and watch that as eating food and just watching something on Python and it you don't have to make it feel like it's some kind of thing that you have to do and if you don't do it it's like homework assignment it's like work just think of it like oh cool like sweet I get to learn this and right after I'm done eating food you know what I'm just gonna put together something for my friends it's gonna be hilarious it's gonna be an insult generator and it's gonna be hosted on here Okuda in Roku which lets you put your websites online and you could be like they could just go to it and type in and you know type in whatever or type in their name and it automatically generates an insult or maybe it automatically generates a compliment so they go to your little Python app that you made and they type in you know raffia qazi my name is Rafa kasi and it says Rafa cause you are awesome and then and if somebody else types it in you know clucks your Mostafa types it and he goes most of all it says most of you're great or must have a you rock but if you want to create an insult generator it could be like most of how you suck most of your horrible and it could just be hilarious so have fun and have these ideas that make you have fun with it and then you'll improve at the same time having fun and then you'll improve a lot faster it's like how animals learn they don't sit there like the tiger dad is not going like has a whiteboard and this is how you run this is how you hunt they just let the kids run around and have fun and then figure out how to do all that same way if you kind of learn football soccer or basketball instead of having a teacher sit there on chalkboard teaching you theory for also long just go out and kick the damn soccer ball have some fun with it try to do some tricks and mess up try to shoot shoot it in the hoop and mess up its who cares if your form is off who cares if you suck at dancing practice it improve and then when you watch the video you're like oh I'm connecting the dots it's fun and I could be building things as I go along I could be taking things things from my head and putting them out there into the real world that people could use that people could share and could not only be fun little games for my friends and family and for myself and inside jokes which is awesome but could also be something that could make an impact in the world could also be something that makes me money it could also be something that gets me that job that I've always wanted and could also be something that becomes my way of being able to travel and wake up whenever I want to and work from wherever I want to I just had a talk with one of the students from my older courses Opie courses his name is nazar Molly and he told me that he's a cg generalist freelancer and the reason why he loves freelancing for example is that he doesn't have to do a he doesn't have to do a commute that saves him two hours so one cool thing is he can wake up and boom be at work so he's never late another cool thing is that he's a father and he gets to spend time with his little daughter he gets to see his daughter grow up he doesn't have to miss those moments with his daughter those special moments and that's invaluable I don't know about you but I can't put a price on it and that's what I mean when I talk about a rich life it's not just money but it's other things involved in there and then he went on to make $1200 using Python in four hours so after he took my course he built this thing that he could use to automate these graphics all right and he was telling me that it took the team in Brazil seven days to do this and it took him four hours to do the same thing and he charged the same as that entire Brazilian team charged and he pocketed $1,200 and got it done in four hours so think about that somebody who works as a as a graphic artist or you know somebody who is working on creating animations and graphics and videos gets to use Python to automate it so even whatever you're currently doing you can use it and it could be practical it could help you boost your income even if you love your job it could help you get that promotion maybe you're not ready to just leave your job and jump into Python which I get can be scary I had I read this comment by this girl I forget her name but basically she said I have a job I'm a single mom I have to take care of my son and I have to take care of myself so I can't just leave my job but I want to use Python to earn that side income you could be doing the same thing I get it some of us have a lot of responsibilities and we can't just jump the ship and burn the bridges and storm the boats we have to go one by one so why not integrate Python into your life to become more valuable at your job maybe get a raise if you can't do that maybe do some side projects on the weekends and if you put in ten hours at $50 an hour in one or two days you're bringing in two thousand dollars extra that's twenty four thousand dollars extra per year if you add on another client or you increase your rate all of a sudden you're bringing in three or four thousand dollars extra per month and now you could start to maybe think about changing from your current job and going Python you know all the way alright alright hopefully this was valuable and helpful for you guys we have went well above our time but again I hope that I was able to bring value I was able to be of service to you if you've loved this trust me just take my word for it the master class I've put together for you is gonna absolutely blow your socks off go in the description link click it it's just a class you can sign up for it and I've put together three amazing videos for you that can honestly change your entire life if you're interested in becoming a Python developer Python freelancer or looking to just use this to boost your side income these three videos will take you from literally zero coding skills to giving you the roadmap to becoming that freelancer or Python developer who lands his or her first client in less than 90 days and gets that paycheck so if you're on Facebook the link is in the description if you're on YouTube go ahead Klink click the link on the description and sign up once you do sign up type in my friend's favorite thing one okay I'm gonna wait for you and then after this we're gonna be wrapping this up so sign up and once you've done signing up type in that beautiful number one look at what Sheldon loved it oh man it's just these live streams are so tiring whoo thank you for the donation papa bar nice I think it was me jumping around this guy code you hadn't yet hilarious oh yeah but isn't YouTube gonna shut us down hey let's find some like no man let's not play around with that that stuff is scary because YouTube is scary let's find some royaltyfree music hey if any of you guys are artists or something you know we'll give you a shoutout but give us some cool music like I don't know I like dubstep hiphop is cool some cool beats I don't know trap whatever you got give it to us we'll might play through the live streams or we'll play it in our videos we'll give you credit and everything and I think it'll be cool so email us at support at clever programmer calm and we'll do it no not $12 and one and a half hour but not bad I get to sit here and talk and you know it doesn't seem too hard monkey says I love your live streams but I can't make it that early can you try to make them later in the day I can try to make them later in the day this was actually later in the day it's 5 P 6 p.m. right to started CST Chicago time where are you located monkey so this is a good time ok so we'll try to make it a little bit later in the day but to respect the larger audience we have that's around 11 a.m. or 10 so unfortunately we're gonna have to do 1100 1000 or 1100 a.m. these videos will be recorded and generally I leave my live streams up I don't leave my webinars up and I don't leave my master classes up like for example this master class I've put together for you guys this is a limited time only I'll be taking it down in just a few days but something like live streams that are recorded they're up so you can come back and watch them and you'll get value out of them okay so just go on YouTube and it'll be there yeah if I can go this time we will like maybe there are some days we might go twice but generally we're we would like to go in the morning that's when everybody is up all right so we have some other people who are saying the like this time as well all right awesome guys thank you so much for watching as always I love your faces off and YouTube and Facebook YouTube I'll see you in the next video
