00:00 - - Welcome back to Learn Python programming
00:03 - for complete and absolute beginners.
00:05 - The 2019 version.
00:07 - This is the most updated course.
00:10 - So thank you guys for jumping in here.
00:12 - Now, what we're gonna do is,
00:14 - we're just gonna go to
the next step, alright?
00:15 - The next step is,
00:16 - I'm gonna show you how functions work.
00:17 - It's gonna be super simple to understand.
00:19 - (upbeat music)
00:25 - You know how variables are used
to remember certain things,
00:29 - like a credit card number,
00:30 - what's really cool is
you can use functions
00:32 - to remember lines of code.
00:33 - So for example, this over here right,
00:37 - what do all of these
lines of code combined do?
00:40 - When I run this program,
00:41 - if you notice the lines I'm highlighting,
00:43 - from 13 to 20,
00:44 - well what are they really doing, right?
00:48 - What they're actually
doing is making a square.
00:49 - So, I'm gonna write
something called a comment.
00:52 - Alright, comment is
something the computer code
00:54 - doesn't care about.
00:55 - For example, let's say I write
something like this right,
00:58 - my code will break.
00:59 - If I go to the consol,
it gives me an error.
01:01 - It says name comment not defined.
01:03 - Everything breaks.
01:04 - But, if I actually put
a little hashtag here,
01:07 - it knows it's for humans
and it won't break my code.
01:10 - My turtle square still gets made.
01:11 - So I'm gonna make a comment
01:13 - and my comment is just gonna say,
01:14 - this is a square, okay?
01:16 - Now if I run this,
01:17 - it'll make a square and anybody else
01:19 - who is reading your code will go,
01:21 - oh I understand what
this piece of code does.
01:23 - But what would be really cool is,
01:24 - if you wanted to make another square,
01:27 - What would you have to do?
01:28 - You would have to copy all of this
01:30 - and then paste it here
again and then run the code.
01:32 - But that's not such a cool way to do that.
01:34 - So, what we're gonna do is,
01:35 - do a cooler way of doing it.
01:36 - So we're gonna create something
called a function, alright?
01:39 - So, I'm gonna go define and
I'm gonna call this function
01:42 - a square and we're gonna
hit enter like this.
01:45 - Now, there's four spaces here, okay?
01:48 - which you need to pay attention to.
01:50 - When I hit enter, it's indented.
01:52 - And indentation is really important
01:53 - because all of this code is
part of this function, okay?
01:56 - That's the idea.
01:57 - And now, literally, what I can do
01:59 - is I can actually copy
this entire square code
02:03 - and paste it in here
02:05 - and I can certainly remove
it from there, okay?
02:09 - Make sure you highlight all of this
02:11 - and hit tab to indent it so
it's all part of this function.
02:16 - Okay, it's all a part of that.
02:17 - For functions, to make them show up,
02:19 - you have to call the function,
02:21 - just like you have to call the variable.
02:23 - So here, we just defined the function,
02:26 - but now if I do, square like that.
02:28 - Alright, so we have square.
02:29 - Now when I run it, if we go to results,
02:32 - Let's go to, oh whoops,
02:34 - we misspelled it again.
02:36 - Let's go square, man that's bad.
02:39 - Alright, so now that we've got square,
02:41 - you can see that the square actually goes
02:43 - and gets made.
02:44 - So now what's really cool is
02:46 - every time I just say square,
it'll make that square okay?
02:49 - So for example, I can say square
02:51 - and then I can say turtle.forward(300).
02:55 - So what it's gonna do,
02:56 - it's gonna make the square,
02:57 - and then it's gonna walk forward by 300
03:00 - and now I can just say square like this
03:04 - and hit enter, alright?
03:06 - So, now it's gonna make
a square, walk over 300
03:08 - and then make, essentially,
another square.
03:11 - Oh, it's starting that
square from the start,
03:14 - which is not what we want.
03:15 - Because we don't want
a new turtle to be made
03:18 - every time we run this code.
03:20 - We basically, just want the same turtle
03:23 - who keeps making squares.
03:25 - First thing we're gonna do
is we don't want the turtle
03:27 - to keep being made over and over again.
03:29 - We're gonna pop that qazi_turtle
03:32 - all the way at the top, okay?
03:34 - And then what we're gonna do,
03:35 - is we're gonna say,
03:36 - qazi_turtle.forward
03:41 - and then we're gonna say by 100, okay?
03:43 - Now, when I run this, check it out,
03:45 - it makes a square
03:46 - and then qazi is gonna go 100 forward.
03:49 - Well, what we can do is make it,
03:50 - let's say, 200 forward.
03:52 - So, it should make a square,
03:53 - and then it should sprint 200 forward
03:57 - and now what we can do is basically make
04:00 - another square like this and hit enter.
04:04 - So now it should go make a square,
04:07 - go 200 forward,
04:07 - and then make another square.
04:09 - It kinda looks like glasses
04:11 - if you look at it sideways.
04:12 - That's what really cool
about leveraging functions
04:17 - because it makes it easier
to recall your code.
04:20 - It makes it really easy
to understand your code
04:22 - and read for people
04:23 - because if you had those
eight lines of code
04:25 - that were really repetitive,
04:26 - it just kept saying turtle.forward(100),
04:29 - turtle.right(90),
04:30 - and it kept doing that.
04:32 - Well, now you defined it in one spot
04:33 - and you can just keep referring to it.
04:35 - So functions are super powerful,
04:36 - super cool and you can do
a lot of things with them
04:41 - that are much more complicated
than what I'm showing you.
04:44 - But simplicity is very important
04:46 - when you're learning at the start.
04:46 - So with that said,
04:47 - thank you so much for watching.
04:49 - More videos are gonna be coming out
04:51 - that are gonna be
teaching you all of this.
04:52 - If you haven't already,
04:54 - How to automate stuff course
will be opening up soon.
04:56 - So, in the description
below, sign up to that.
04:59 - Lastly, I have all your
notes in this one called
05:03 - How do functions work?
05:05 - So, this is the URL for it, just in case.
05:08 - And if you go to it,
05:09 - then you can have access
to all of my code.
05:11 - You can just run it,
05:12 - use it however you want
05:13 - and it's also gonna be
in the descriptions below
05:15 - so you can leverage it.
05:17 - Okay, with that said,
05:18 - thank you so much for watching.
05:19 - I love your face
05:20 - and I'll see you in the next video.
