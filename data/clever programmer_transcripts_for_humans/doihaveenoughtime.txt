00:01 - okay so somebody so he just said um you
00:06 - have a wife and she needs time to and of
00:08 - course she does but also keep in mind
00:11 - people like Gary Vaynerchuk or people
00:14 - like Grant Cardone
00:15 - also have a wife but they're run like
00:18 - multiple businesses there are multi
00:21 - millionaires they change the lives of
00:23 - millions of people they work non-stop

00:31 - with their health they still spend
00:33 - quality time with their children and to
00:35 - still spend quality time with their
00:38 - family so don't lie to yourself that you
00:40 - don't have time I'm not gonna lie to
00:44 - myself that I don't have time we mess up
00:47 - but we just need to be honest with why
00:49 - we're making those mistakes okay that's
00:52 - where your real change is gonna come
00:54 - from if you can't look at yourself in
00:57 - the mirror and be honest with yourself
00:58 - don't expect anybody else to change your
01:01 - life I can't change your life that
01:03 - person next to you can't change your
01:05 - life and if you're not gonna be honest
01:07 - with yourself you can't change your life
01:09 - either so start from there start from
01:14 - being honest with yourself exactly where
01:16 - you are in your relationship in your
01:19 - career in your life your friends near
01:24 - you write your girlfriend/boyfriend
01:29 - your wife husband whatever start there

01:34 - what level each of those things are at
01:37 - are you happy making the money or making
01:39 - every year are you happy being able to
01:43 - just go from paycheck to paycheck
01:45 - are you happy doing things in a way
01:49 - that's average where you know you could
01:51 - be doing better if you're not then there
01:58 - are things that need to change and to
02:01 - start that change you need to start by
02:03 - being honest with yourself okay because
02:06 - if you make excuses and if you let
02:08 - yourself off the hook and you say things
02:10 - like oh but I have this
02:13 - so that needs time too while that is
02:15 - true you have those 24 hours if you
02:19 - juice them and you melt them you can get
02:21 - a lot done all right you can get a lot
02:25 - done like I'm gonna tell you from my
02:29 - personal experience and I'm not amazing

02:35 - college kid and now I'm just a kid who's
02:38 - trying to run clever programmer and make
02:40 - sure you guys get massive value out of
02:41 - it but when I was building clever
02:46 - programmer you know this is the fastest
02:48 - channel to go from zero to a hundred
02:50 - thousand subscribers for coding ever how
02:54 - did that happen
02:54 - was was there magic involved no I was
02:57 - spending like hundreds of hours a week I
03:00 - was still spending time with my family I
03:03 - still kept up with my friends you guys
03:06 - still see my friends in my Instagram
03:08 - Facebook stories on snapchat and even on

03:31 - going to kindergarten to students who
03:36 - were 45 years old and doing their PhD
03:39 - program for analytics and needed to use
03:42 - Python for machine learning I was also
03:47 - playing chess competitively at the time
03:49 - and going to tournaments I was also
03:52 - going to ping pong tournaments at the
03:55 - same time I was building this channel

04:27 - and get value out of it maybe clever
04:29 - programmer will be able to provide value
04:31 - to other people maybe I can help
04:33 - somebody who's not just me and a lot of
04:36 - these things that I learned I can share
04:37 - this with other people because I was I
04:39 - don't want to hold this to myself
04:41 - because I thought what's the point of
