01:24 - new skills, and what I mean by 80% fun
01:25 - is take the code, take this
knowledge that you've learned
01:28 - about coding, and have 80% fun with it,
01:31 - build your own things with
it, break things with it,
01:33 - like nothing's gonna
happen, go crazy, right?

02:08 - We actually ended up
procrastinating the snooker playing,

instead of scrolling
02:28 - through Facebook, and blah, blah, blah,
