06:00 - crazy how flat it is though it's really
06:02 - really flat
06:03 - i'm surprised on that portion i will say
06:06 - yeah because for the processor
06:08 - now it's replaced by amazon 11.5
06:11 - millimeters
06:12 - that's the now that's thin that is thin
06:15 - it's a shortened design and one chip the
06:16 - system
06:18 - and when i took its processor graphics
06:19 - into a single chip that's awesome i love
06:21 - that portion
06:23 - um what else i love their just website
06:26 - design by the way it's just oh whoa whoa
06:27 - whoa whoa whoa whoa
06:27 - that color look at this oh that's like
06:30 - that's like a magnet oh [ __ ] easily
06:33 - attaches via magnets i like that
06:35 - animation that's cool animation right
06:39 - yeah brilliant 4.5 4.5 key right on
06:43 - display
06:44 - what wow that is sick
06:48 - let's see what else we got they also
06:50 - released like the
06:51 - pro display like the apple pro display i
06:54 - don't know
06:55 - how did they do that bro sorry for
06:58 - interrupting you but
06:58 - this user experience is crazy like
07:00 - you're scrolling down
07:03 - how do they think that is insane dude
07:05 - that is insane sorry bro so what were
07:07 - you saying man
07:09 - i was saying that they also released
07:11 - some display like prores displays like
07:13 - apple sells their own display i guess
07:15 - yeah yeah yeah they have some
07:16 - improvements on that too yeah yeah yeah
07:21 - turkish stun is like 4.5 key display i
07:24 - don't know
07:25 - would be cool for us to be able to
07:27 - figure out how we can do this in css or
07:29 - like
07:29 - like that's possible i'm sure it's [ __ ]
07:30 - is what what is what's going on here
07:32 - they're zooming in
07:33 - it says it's screaming but the thing is
07:35 - it's not a screen like keep scrolling up
07:37 - like in the beginning it's not a screen
07:38 - like scroll up scroll down i mean no no
07:39 - no
07:40 - scroll the other way so at first it's
07:42 - like the typical
07:43 - css transition or when you scroll down
07:46 - you see like the background image
07:47 - right like scroll down sorry sorry when
07:51 - i say scroll down i mean like go down on
07:52 - the website
07:53 - yeah so it's just like the typical
07:55 - background image as an embedded yeah
07:56 - yeah yeah
07:57 - yeah and then when they zoom out and
07:58 - they make it look like the screen that
08:00 - looks james james foreman says it's a 3d
08:02 - library that's really interesting yeah
08:04 - yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah do you
08:07 - happen to know what a library
08:09 - is yeah yeah yeah this is cool
08:12 - holy [ __ ] i just don't like this does i
08:15 - don't
08:16 - like this division right here this is
08:17 - what i don't like the color
08:19 - no there's division between the this
08:21 - right here you see the division between
08:22 - the
08:23 - yellow and the white i don't like this
08:25 - division it just looks odd to me
08:28 - that's it you know hey neil patel just
08:31 - said they want to see this clone
08:33 - we gotta close this dude
08:36 - that'd be a good challenge man wait so

08:55 - [ __ ] this stuff you know look how tiny
08:58 - these things are bro like it has to fit
09:00 - into
09:01 - how thin that thing is i don't oh yeah
09:03 - that's insane to me the sound system on
09:05 - amex brings an incredible room filling
09:07 - audio to any space
09:09 - yeah i guess i just don't my macbook pro
09:12 - goes like
09:13 - two days of battery life without dying
09:15 - what's up

09:19 - days of battery life without dying
09:22 - two days on battery without dying wow
09:25 - yeah that's do you have the ammo do you

10:16 - second it wanted me it was like all this
10:18 - guy's trying to find uh you know the

10:26 - so hold on hold on if i refresh this
10:31 - that's so interesting

10:56 - take out the actual
10:57 - i'm gonna undock it right here so here's
11:00 - we have now got the code right here
11:04 - so if we have this code okay
11:07 - right here okay so what's going on here
11:10 - let's see
11:11 - we have here this and as i scroll
11:14 - it transforms so you can see on the
11:17 - right
11:17 - they they have this matrix right here so
11:20 - they do in order for us to be able to
11:22 - properly see transformation
11:24 - they have a matrix look at this bro you
11:26 - see this
11:28 - they have a matrix yeah you have a
11:31 - matrix
11:32 - and i'm doing transform so as i scroll
11:35 - opacity changes you see
11:38 - yep and then this is a little javascript
11:42 - bro i 100 know it and then it's cool
11:44 - wait the [ __ ] the image does not change

12:09 - change right yes it does change it
12:10 - that's the crazy part
12:11 - look at this that looks nice dude
12:15 - it looks like the waterfall effect
12:18 - how the f [ __ ]
12:22 - that transition is just so smooth i
12:24 - don't know how they do it
12:26 - so crispy clean because here it is it's
12:28 - it's this thing
12:29 - oh right here so it'll they're all doing
12:32 - through something called the matrix
12:34 - look at this i just wanna um let me go
12:36 - put this on here
12:37 - oh wait it's all going through a matrix
12:41 - so if i scroll on here see there's
12:43 - something called transform matrix
12:45 - if i go here it's the h2 so as i scroll
12:50 - boom dude that's cool crazy man it's
12:52 - crazy how
12:54 - crazy css has gotten to where
12:58 - css takes care of some of those
12:59 - animations yeah i know
13:01 - things you could start to do you know
13:02 - can i do transform trans
13:04 - form matrix on here so if i did if i do
13:08 - matrix transform
13:10 - let's see transforming matrix in css so
13:13 - css
13:13 - css2d transforms is what you're going to
13:15 - use matrix for so if i do okay
13:18 - so i can rotate
13:21 - i can rotate i can skew
13:25 - is there like uh what about what about
13:29 - matrix though
13:31 - like a matrix set what the [ __ ] is the
13:32 - matrix i don't know click on it let's
13:34 - see where it takes us
13:35 - i won't click oh i need to find it first
13:38 - there it is right there the matrix
13:39 - method combines
13:40 - all the 2d transform methods into one ah
13:43 - okay it's like the skill the skew the
13:45 - skill y
13:46 - all the translate watch oh so translate
13:48 - what is the last one
13:50 - that's like when you when i go into here
13:52 - let me go back into my code the code now
13:54 - i'm like about their code
13:55 - you see this right here stays the same
13:58 - but what's actually going on is this
14:00 - number this is translate why
14:02 - this right here is changing the y on the
14:05 - this
14:05 - so basically for those of you who are
14:07 - listening i really wish we had more
14:08 - people

15:36 - david what is going on brother oh
15:41 - this is within clever programmer by the
15:42 - way so you can if you guys simply just
15:44 - go ahead and join clever program that's
15:45 - all you gotta you guys gotta do awesome
15:46 - sweet so
15:47 - that's cool i like that so i make has
15:49 - apps just about everything
15:51 - mac iphone i'm actually i want to ask
15:54 - you a question what do you think about
15:55 - this whole
15:56 - m1 chip system because it's running a
15:58 - completely different system right
16:00 - like even for example for all these
16:02 - other apps they have to use emulators
16:05 - like what do you think about this i'm
16:06 - curious like the future of
16:08 - of what apple just did with the m1 chip
16:11 - gotcha so so i guess i
16:13 - do you mean it's basically a different
16:15 - os and it runs the emulator of
16:17 - the old one or whatever the os right now
16:19 - is the same right the last right now is
16:21 - the same
16:22 - it's what has changed is is very simple
16:26 - what has changed is i think
16:29 - the i don't know how
16:32 - it because for example it's kind of like
16:34 - a different less system because
16:36 - for example if i you know it's kind of
16:40 - like when i do ubuntu
16:41 - and if i want to run a windows
16:42 - application i use an emulator
16:45 - they're doing that with the m1 chip on
16:47 - the mac os system
16:49 - so for any for example yeah so for any
16:52 - for example
16:53 - um you know for any not
16:56 - project but for any application that is
16:58 - not m1 chip compatible
17:00 - they're they emulate oh that's dope dude
17:04 - that is dope because now they have more
17:06 - compatibility with the whole thing's got
17:07 - you
17:08 - exactly yo that is cool i didn't know
17:10 - that was what was going on really
17:12 - didn't know that you didn't know that
17:14 - yeah so like i just i just thought the
17:15 - m1 chip was just
17:16 - jacked and it was like super powerful i
17:18 - didn't know it was all not
17:19 - backwards compatible so so to deal with
17:22 - backwards compatibility
17:23 - meaning to deal with applications that
17:25 - wouldn't be able to use this new
17:27 - technology
17:28 - what they did is they run the old
17:30 - applications on emulators
17:31 - yeah yeah yeah yeah you didn't know that
17:34 - really
17:35 - crazy dude yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
17:37 - so fun part is
17:38 - that the ability applications are
17:40 - actually running
17:41 - faster than the actual intel application
17:43 - no way dude
17:45 - wait what'd you say so you see
17:48 - emulated emulated apps are running way
17:50 - more faster than the original apps which
17:52 - are used in the intel mobile
17:53 - yeah so like they need the new yeah the
17:55 - new ones are just running a lot more
17:56 - faster yeah so let's see the m1 chip is
17:57 - an air on processor
17:59 - not x86 processor it integrates more
18:01 - components than
18:02 - an intel cpu yeah together you see so
18:05 - that's why it has to has to run it
18:06 - differently
18:07 - double one one also integrates around
18:09 - the same package it features rosetta
18:11 - dynamic binary translation
18:12 - the tube boasts eight cpu cores in
18:15 - addition to the integrated gpu
18:17 - it is manufactured using five nanometer
18:18 - processors that has 16 billion resistors
18:20 - that's a lot of resistors actually
18:22 - um dude that's jacked bro that's all
18:24 - that's that's crazy crazy i actually
18:26 - didn't know that was what was going on
18:28 - man yeah no bro yeah that's awesome we
18:31 - have do you want a person one person
18:32 - abrar in the clubhouse let's go
18:37 - yeah let's just talk to him let's see go
18:39 - ahead and wait to sleep
18:40 - he's
18:50 - i feel like david should be able to just
18:52 - pop up to the top
18:53 - yeah yeah david dear what's up
18:58 - my friend what are you saying bro
19:01 - [Laughter]
19:03 - m1 um non-compatible
19:09 - double applications
19:14 - too good to be true plenty so they're
19:15 - not compatible yes respond you have to
19:16 - check i want capability for a mac with
19:18 - this yeah
19:20 - there is no app that is not compatible
19:22 - with it
19:23 - there's the rosetta which does the
19:26 - heartbreak
19:27 - yes there's a lot like even photoshop is
19:29 - compatible as now
19:31 - yeah yeah i i mean it's going to take
19:33 - them time
19:34 - it's going to take time for all these
19:35 - applications to be compatible but yeah
19:37 - uh
19:38 - for those those that are not compatible
19:39 - it's ready running rosetta stone
19:41 - rosetta stone to be able to make them
19:43 - competitive basically it's an emulator
19:44 - rosetta stone
19:45 - i think it's called rosetta stone what
19:47 - is that what it's
19:50 - that something totally called or is that
19:53 - a
19:54 - rosetta stone is like to learn a
19:55 - language dude
19:57 - you want to pick up spanish you get the
19:59 - rosetta stone
20:01 - somebody says no doubt apple's worth
20:03 - 2.23 trillion dollars yes
20:05 - i i i would not be um yeah
20:08 - it is worth a lot i will say guys it is
20:10 - worth a lot
20:11 - a lot exactly but just dropped
20:15 - that i don't look at that i don't look
20:18 - at i don't look
20:19 - at the short uh yeah i look at the long
20:22 - term the long term from apple has always
20:24 - been up so
20:25 - that to me doesn't matter too much
20:27 - exactly so let me see i mean short term
20:30 - after every apple even it drops so yeah
20:33 - emulator
20:35 - oh i just i just buy my apples from
20:37 - costco that's
20:38 - it looks apple silicon
20:41 - m1 mla x86 is still faster than every
20:43 - other mac and single core benchmark no
20:45 - [ __ ] way
20:57 - wow that's insane the first native
20:59 - benchmarks of apple
21:00 - appeared on the green bench uh site last
21:02 - week showing impressive native
21:04 - performance
21:04 - today new benchmarks have begun showing
21:07 - up for the m1
21:08 - chip emulating x86 under rosetta two
21:11 - separate other two is what
21:12 - what what it's called right yes um so
21:15 - let's take a look at it
21:19 - thank you intel for playing yeah good
21:22 - luck
21:23 - good luck so we have what so the eight
21:27 - chords are the what
21:28 - the that's crazy wow
21:35 - what's up what's up no there's a ssd
21:39 - problem in this mac
21:40 - like the swap usage is waste way too
21:42 - much and people are complaining about
21:45 - this
21:45 - is getting degraded quickly really
21:47 - that's interesting yeah but the swap
21:48 - usage is only
21:49 - only big if you are doing heavy workload
21:52 - and you only have the eight gigabyte ram
21:54 - version
21:55 - so if you have the 16 it's all good
21:58 - yeah i mean i didn't have any issues but
22:00 - people on twitter are just going like
22:01 - boom like
22:02 - yeah yeah yeah yeah i've never had this
22:05 - max
22:05 - so the new rosetta 2 geekbench results
22:07 - uploaded showed that the m1 chip running
22:09 - a macbook air with 8 gigs of ram has a
22:11 - single
22:12 - core and multi-scores of one thousand
22:13 - hundred and five thousand eight hundred
22:15 - eighty three respectively
22:16 - since this version of geekbench is
22:18 - running through apple's translation
22:19 - layers are the two
22:20 - an input performance as to be expected
22:22 - reset the two running x86 appears to be
22:24 - achieving
22:25 - 78 percent the performance of native
22:28 - apple silicon code
22:29 - wow that's crazy despite the impact on
22:32 - performance
22:33 - the single core resulted to rise up to
22:35 - scores though still outperforms any
22:37 - other intel mac including 2020
22:39 - no [ __ ] way so
22:42 - basically we need to get the m1
22:46 - oh yeah what are we doing bro let's go
22:48 - get the m1 get the m1 chip put it on
22:50 - everything
22:51 - i mean i mean my macbook is doing great
22:53 - is yours m1
22:54 - no no it's intel damn but yeah funny
22:58 - story about a funny story about my
23:00 - funny story i kind of actually actually
23:02 - tell the story
23:07 - yeah it kind of came free by surprise
23:11 - surprise anyways yeah so uh
23:14 - okay cool cool cool that's awesome yeah
23:16 - so yeah so what do you think about i'm
23:18 - very curious like what what do you think
23:20 - about
23:20 - you know where this m1 chip is going to
23:22 - go this m1
23:24 - um you know um like what are they doing
23:27 - to the industry
23:29 - the next thing is the m2 bro obviously i
23:31 - have two i mean i get it i get it but
23:33 - like
23:34 - what do you think is gonna happen like
23:36 - because i think what i've done is
23:37 - something really interesting right
23:38 - uh they've completely outperformed any
23:41 - any other
23:42 - what's it called um you know processor
23:44 - processor out there pretty much
23:46 - right um yeah but if you think about it
23:48 - like they
23:49 - already have it in the iphone in the
23:51 - ipad like
23:52 - it's the same architecture
23:55 - yeah like every other phone is there
23:59 - that's true that's true they have it in
24:01 - the in the iphone they add
24:02 - in and so forth i just think that what's
24:05 - really cool for me
24:07 - is just seeing the future of this right
24:10 - because
24:10 - yeah the thing is the thing is this just
24:14 - kind of showed everybody how intel sucks
24:16 - right so um exactly right i need to
24:19 - i mean intro could do it too i mean
24:22 - or maybe this can lead to intel creating
24:24 - their own computer
24:28 - like in their future plans they don't
24:31 - have any
24:32 - um based processor in the in the coming
24:34 - years
24:35 - like they have just announced it wait
24:36 - wait what are you saying what are you
24:38 - saying
24:40 - i mean they don't plan to make arm-based
24:42 - chips in like the near future
24:45 - oh they don't plan to make any more
24:47 - processors in the near future
24:49 - no no our arm arm base like this this
24:52 - kind of process like the m1
24:54 - because right now like like you said uh
24:57 - the ram
24:58 - and the processor is on the same chip
24:59 - with the m1 yeah
25:01 - and and and intel is only selling
25:04 - standalone chips
25:06 - and that's why that's why it gets
25:08 - outperformed
25:09 - [Music]
25:13 - interesting interesting oh look at what
25:15 - they just released by the way
25:17 - look at the they released it the ipad
25:20 - pro got an
25:21 - update right there so the ipad pro m1
25:23 - chip 12.9 inch liquid retina
25:25 - xdr that's on
25:33 - with center stage what is that supposed
25:35 - to mean dude
25:37 - that's like the firm facing camera is
25:39 - gonna follow you if you move around and
25:41 - when you are on facebook
25:43 - do you see this bro the animations the
25:46 - amazing so
25:47 - good but i mean it's all software
25:50 - because it's an ultraviolet camera and
25:53 - they just software-based like crop in
25:55 - focus hold on hold on david david we're
25:58 - we're talking about the ui experience
26:02 - here on this on this on this on this
26:04 - website look at this
26:06 - this is by far the most insane
26:08 - experience i've ever had
26:10 - oh [ __ ]
26:14 - wow oh my god it gets
26:18 - better wait wait wait
26:22 - oh oh oh oh
26:25 - oh omg on the last one bro omg 5g
26:29 - omg oh my god guys who think this is who
26:33 - who thinks
26:34 - who wants to see this clone guys it
26:36 - might be like a video
26:38 - playing in the background when you
26:39 - scroll it
26:42 - wow oh that's a good point do you hear
26:43 - what he said yeah what's up what's up
26:45 - it's just a video i don't think it's i
26:46 - don't know no it's not really because it
26:48 - look
26:48 - it's scrollable you see so like i don't
26:51 - know i don't think yeah
26:52 - oh you think so like that you can scroll
26:54 - it and i'll pull up the code again pull
26:56 - up the code again
26:57 - doesn't see it looks like it's a video
26:59 - let's see we're gonna
27:00 - test it by looking at the code oh
27:04 - no it's an image no these are all images
27:07 - that are just
27:09 - this is all crazy animations
27:13 - all right
27:18 - this is sticky overflow do you see
27:20 - anything changing cause i don't see
27:21 - anything anything changing
27:23 - in terms of matrix wise bro they're
27:25 - hiding it
27:27 - they're good they're [ __ ] good as
27:30 - well i'll tell you
27:31 - like yeah because what we're looking at
27:33 - right now is just all these animations
27:34 - that are going on when you when you're
27:35 - on the ipad page
27:36 - and there's just there's just honestly
27:41 - how are you doing hi hold on you gotta
27:43 - invite them bro
27:44 - chill i thought cause my dance teacher
27:47 - by the way
27:48 - oh listen she's at my dance teacher in
27:50 - uh
27:51 - in michigan nice
27:54 - this is awesome wow
28:00 - i know she left it's cause the people
28:03 - that join us in clubhouse
28:04 - yeah yeah if they're coming from not
28:07 - from youtube like from clubhouse
28:08 - yeah they don't know we're just on
28:11 - youtube
28:11 - experiencing this i think we just have
28:13 - to figure out like a better integration
28:15 - with cl
28:15 - like i love the fact that we could bring
28:16 - people into clubhouse like atari and
28:18 - then just have a conversation
28:20 - we have to figure out something there
28:21 - with the audio video okay i think
28:24 - i mean i mean because he also sees
28:26 - everything a couple seconds behind than
28:27 - we do
28:28 - that is sure true that's true but you
28:30 - know we'll figure something out that's
28:31 - okay we'll fix it
28:32 - so it looks like we're looking right now
28:33 - it says faster performance and and
28:35 - graphics the 8 core cpu m1 delivers up
28:37 - to 50 percent faster
28:38 - what i'm curious about is actually not
28:40 - this processor speed i'm not just
28:42 - curious about the battery life on this
28:44 - thing
28:44 - damn look at all those it's more than
28:46 - like two days like it's two days
28:50 - my my board my macbook pro doesn't die i
28:53 - mean it
28:53 - never dies i feel like i feel like the
28:55 - ipad would
28:56 - last
29:09 - what's up man i'm doing great how are
29:12 - you guys then chilling out on clubhouse
29:14 - i guess
29:15 - yeah on youtube too
29:18 - oh [ __ ] you guys are on youtube yeah
29:20 - yeah you just got recorded
29:21 - cussing on youtube amanda good job oh
29:24 - [ __ ] do you see this
29:25 - so what's going on is it moving hold on
29:27 - as he's moving it's moving the camera
29:30 - yeah that's what david that is so smart
29:33 - yeah that's what i said
29:35 - oh [ __ ] you guys are watching the apple
29:37 - event huh yeah
29:52 - like the imac like that's the best thing
29:54 - like
29:58 - yeah yeah yeah this is awesome this is
30:00 - so good i love this portion
30:02 - so lighter the lighter scanner measures
30:04 - how long it takes light to reflect
30:05 - back from objects so they can create a
30:07 - depth map of any space you're in
30:09 - and unlock immersive immersive with
30:12 - immersive ar experiences
30:14 - and it works with the powerful asp to
30:16 - market guys if by the way guys if you
30:18 - guys have any questions let us know in
30:19 - the comments below
30:20 - we'll definitely be able to you know
30:21 - we'll definitely uh talk with you about
30:23 - that so
30:24 - a thunderbolt a port that's ready to
30:26 - rumble that's interesting
30:28 - that's interesting for sure let me see
30:30 - what's my next call my next close by one
30:32 - thirty so i'm good
30:33 - okay thunderbolt ported to rumble yeah
30:36 - thunderball is just crazy i will say
30:37 - that
30:38 - it's a crazy crazy insane is this a
30:41 - thunderbolt now
30:41 - you got the m1 on an ipad what the hell
30:44 - is better oh they finally have the
30:47 - the white version of the keyboard
30:50 - damn i don't think did they have the
30:52 - white version of the keyboard beforehand
30:53 - or no
30:55 - yeah it's a new it's new it's a new one
30:57 - right
30:58 - hell yeah yeah that's awesome now their
31:01 - keyboards have like touch id for the
31:02 - imacs
31:04 - yeah wow i mean
31:07 - we have that right now so like that's
31:08 - what this is right here but
31:10 - it's not as cool as this one wow
31:14 - it doesn't have an animation with it
31:16 - yeah i also see a lot of future
31:18 - in the ipad west sn2 by the way like
31:21 - i now use my ipad as a macbook as a
31:24 - computer now because like i can do the
31:25 - whole command space searching
31:27 - i can shift normally between different
31:29 - different things like you know like this
31:30 - stuff right here
31:31 - i can shift normally it's so it's so
31:34 - seamless it's so easy like it's
31:35 - literally almost like you're making it
31:36 - it's literally almost on my microphone
31:37 - like
31:38 - damn okay i can have my windows open
31:41 - everything
31:44 - something you said now with the m1 you
31:46 - could be like color grading videos and
31:49 - video editing stuff
31:50 - there's a new reconfiguration offers
31:52 - more two terabytes
31:55 - [ __ ] dude go to the pricing bro let's
31:58 - let's let's jack it up and see how let's
32:00 - do it
32:01 - gonna do it the most expensive one what
32:03 - do we got here 12.9 inch
32:05 - okay so first of all let's do some
32:07 - spaces
32:09 - two terabytes two terabytes
32:12 - let's
32:19 - that will only decrease the cost that
32:20 - won't decrease two thousand two thousand
32:22 - four hundred that's not bad
32:32 - oh my god
32:35 - sonny said do you know what library to
32:38 - use to make these cool transitions i
32:39 - mean i mean you know
32:41 - there's multiple libraries you can use
32:42 - we can definitely definitely do like a
32:44 - podcast at some point to figure out what
32:46 - library you can use together
32:47 - something like this yeah do you know
32:49 - there's like a video editing library for
32:51 - javascript
32:52 - what's up there is a video editing
32:55 - library for javascript
32:58 - oh yeah i know i i thought it was coming
33:01 - out
33:01 - coming out recently um it was like
33:05 - wait what was that name actually i
33:06 - couldn't remember that's so cool we had
33:08 - like five people
33:09 - we have my thumb people come and go
33:14 - come on guys oh someone just jumped on
33:17 - where
33:17 - oh he did oh man thank him who's maitam
33:34 - do i know you dude we went to uh
33:38 - we all done together we had uh me you
33:41 - and um
33:42 - that was a steve and robert
33:48 - [Laughter]
33:50 - oh [ __ ] damn it's been a while
33:55 - it's bad amazing
33:59 - no remember holy [ __ ] how you doing man
34:04 - i'm doing really good i uh still in the
34:07 - blocking world
34:08 - are you still in the blockchain world
34:12 - dude that's crazy she's absolutely not
34:13 - are you in dogecoin
34:17 - you know like i every time i'm like you
34:19 - know i should put money in it
34:21 - i'm literally working in this business
34:22 - bro just put the [ __ ] money into it
34:25 - man don't wait
34:27 - gotta gotta learn how to take rent i put
34:30 - in uh let me see i put it myself
34:33 - i put in 500 into into dosh coin
34:37 - and then show them the money i put into
34:40 - 100
34:40 - i mean it is currently i put in 500 it
34:43 - is i am
34:44 - up 2 800 right now damn son that's all
34:48 - right
34:49 - that's crazy that's not bad huh i mean
34:52 - that's
34:53 - pretty good that's not bad at all i mean
34:54 - compared to some people who have like
34:55 - eighty thousand dollars you know that's
34:57 - up you know so like you make some crazy
35:00 - cash on this
35:06 - i'm like what the hell i know i mean
35:09 - just didn't
35:09 - say 500 and you got like 2008 2 800 from
35:13 - the yeah
35:13 - right 2 800 return yeah yeah yeah yeah
35:16 - black magic of something yeah it was
35:19 - literally
35:20 - what is it like a third of a cent like a
35:24 - month ago like two months ago
35:25 - and now it's thirty three steps
35:30 - i think it will go up to a dollar
35:33 - you think so what do you think
35:36 - i mean you you choice i mean i mean
35:39 - daniel you trade stocks here daniel
35:40 - yeah i don't i don't trade crypto though
35:43 - ah it's the same [ __ ]
35:46 - it's the same stuff it's the same thing
35:48 - i mean not same stuff but you know
35:50 - but yeah yeah the market is the market
35:52 - the market is the market
35:53 - yeah i mean i don't know go ahead
35:58 - [Music]
36:02 - [Laughter]
36:10 - circle church he was just collecting the
36:14 - commissions that's what he was doing
36:18 - not going to that axis so now guys so
36:20 - guys raise your hand here
36:21 - uh who is a believer in in in uh
36:25 - in coins when you say raise your hand
36:27 - here crypto
36:28 - are you tying youtube are you talking
36:29 - clubhouse you too and clubhouse you can
36:31 - raise your hand too right
36:33 - oh yeah you could raise your hand on
36:34 - clubhouse you can raise your hand you
36:35 - see so raise your hand
36:36 - on android i cannot change my hand but
36:38 - yeah here we go
36:42 - do you believe in crypto i'm on android
36:43 - i'm gonna do that thing yeah
36:45 - yeah blockchain's pretty dope yeah yeah

37:19 - for some guy and crypto or some some
37:21 - stuff like that correct

37:50 - yeah yeah yeah yeah but anyways so what
37:52 - do you what do you do right now tell me
37:54 - mathem
37:55 - okay so back back in the day i used to
37:58 - do like
37:58 - straight ups about mixing if you want to
38:00 - build something on ethereum i would say
38:02 - that
38:12 - like temporary project manager role
38:14 - right um i gotta come up with a lot of
38:16 - banks
38:17 - like traditional institutions and
38:20 - these guys were like all across europe
38:22 - all across asia
38:24 - i went to korea a few times lived in
38:27 - europe for like about a year
38:30 - um so that was like that was living the
38:32 - highlight but dude
38:33 - i spent like every amount of money i
38:35 - made i just spent a party
38:38 - wait you split you spent on what
38:41 - partying
38:42 - partying like yeah oh so you're a party
38:46 - all the time
38:48 - i was partying like here's the thing
38:52 - if you want to become a consultant it's
38:53 - not about what you know about who you
38:55 - know
38:55 - and the way i got science was straight
38:58 - up going to party and meeting these like
39:00 - crypto guys and like having fun with
39:02 - them
39:03 - and then like if they like you they'll
39:05 - give you their business
39:07 - so so so what did you say in terms of
39:09 - because in terms of consulting
39:11 - did you basically basically help them
39:12 - start a coin like have their own you
39:15 - know
39:15 - ico you you know what what did you have
39:18 - them start with
39:19 - initially with ico ico sure okay
39:24 - but then what i transitioned into was
39:27 - helping helping traditional institutions
39:30 - get out of blockchain
39:31 - yeah and that might have included like
39:34 - one of my olympic clients was they
39:37 - wanted to build an exchange
39:38 - for tokenized securities like poker
39:41 - night stocks
39:42 - tokenized companies chairs and
39:45 - they needed to be fcc regulated and they
39:49 - also needed to work with blockchain
39:50 - so bridging that gap between regulation
39:53 - and
39:54 - blockchain technology was kind of my job
39:56 - yeah
39:57 - let's see what you like i literally went
39:59 - read like
40:00 - act like like law passed by congress
40:03 - like straight up started reading like
40:04 - 500 pages
40:06 - and kind of like talked with
40:09 - both the bullyers and the technology
40:11 - guys come up with a plan
40:13 - yeah um so it was getting a
40:16 - pretty good knowledge how much let me
40:19 - ask this question
40:20 - how much were you making how much will
40:22 - we make it per month on the consulting
40:25 - i was i remember
40:28 - 14 20 sometimes 20
40:31 - 000 that was for one year though yeah so
40:35 - 20 000 a month you're making from
40:36 - consulting on uh ico
40:39 - that was max that was like the knack
40:41 - that made first that's not bad yeah
40:44 - yeah from consult consulting for
40:46 - consulting coins
40:48 - it's not bad at all yeah okay you get to
40:50 - party and make 20k bro that's that's
40:52 - a good life wait are you are you in usa
40:55 - right now i know
40:58 - yeah i'm in detroit actually oh detroit
41:00 - oh [ __ ]
41:01 - well i'll come out here to la you know
41:02 - whenever you never get the chance
41:05 - i know i know you're in like you look at
41:07 - your linkedin profile
41:09 - you're uh dude i i knew you're always
41:11 - like you're
41:12 - you're always saying how you want to
41:14 - teach people i remember that
41:16 - i really had that fire you need to do it
41:18 - yeah
41:19 - and you're doing that right yeah yeah
41:22 - that's what we do is
41:23 - we now we now teach people what
41:24 - basically some somebody said mr beast is
41:27 - here
41:27 - oh let's go mr beast
41:28 - [Laughter]
41:32 - yeah like i mean it's it's been crazy
41:34 - it's been one of my for some reason from
41:36 - one of my goals in life has always been
41:38 - to teach for some reason i don't know
41:39 - why
41:40 - but and and i loved it and because
41:44 - my mom was actually a teacher when i was
41:47 - in her belly
41:48 - like when i was just pregnant with me
41:50 - she was teaching
41:51 - damn so it's in your bed bro it's
41:53 - literally in my blood you know
41:56 - and then i kind of started out that
41:58 - would make sense why not as a really
42:00 - good teacher
42:02 - like he's he from
42:05 - the womb he got the teaching skills
42:07 - exactly exactly
42:11 - and it was crazy you know what's crazy
42:12 - is that i went
42:14 - um at one point i think two months ago i
42:16 - was talking with my mom
42:17 - and we kind of shared our experiences in
42:19 - terms of how our teaching styles
42:22 - and we didn't know this but apparently
42:24 - we have the exact same teaching styles
42:26 - mean her
42:28 - oh [ __ ] yeah you picked them up from the
42:31 - womb bro
42:33 - from you from anybody in your in your by
42:35 - the way uh
42:37 - david not daniel [ __ ] david's not here
42:40 - daniel anybody from your you know from
42:43 - your family does like engineering it's

42:47 - engineering bro your whole family is
42:48 - yeah
42:49 - oh really yeah interesting all of them
42:53 - now it's starting to make sense it's
42:55 - like my dad and my grandson
42:57 - and everybody has been in sales and
42:59 - marketing
43:01 - now it makes everything adds up really
43:03 - for me
43:04 - because i love more marketing than
43:06 - software development
43:07 - it's interesting it's different here
43:10 - it's different here my parents are
43:12 - doctors but i'm not

45:12 - commitments
45:14 - at the air tech today yeah apple is
45:18 - global corporate operations with all of
45:20 - our offices

46:41 - credit scores
46:42 - i don't know when there were two holders

48:40 - there's a lot of future with that
48:42 - you know that that's gonna go forward um
48:44 - [Music]
48:46 - i'm really excited about where the
48:47 - future heads out with
48:49 - all these like uh you know more m1
48:51 - products
48:52 - i'm on i mean apple's really kind of
48:54 - really kind of gotten really good at
48:56 - what they're doing
48:56 - with other products however i really
48:58 - hope they don't like they make the
48:59 - macbook pro colorful
49:01 - like how they did the imac bro you don't
49:03 - like it no
49:04 - man i just don't like it so is that the
49:06 - only negative review you have right now
49:07 - just the
49:08 - just the colors just the color what do
49:09 - you think i don't know man
49:12 - maybe i'm sad they don't have the pink
49:14 - color
49:17 - bad news they are going to redesign the
49:19 - macbooks later this year
49:20 - no man don't tell me that come on
49:24 - and and they are going to remove the
49:26 - dirty bar
49:27 - that's fine i hate the touch bar yeah
49:30 - i don't use it i don't use it at all but
49:33 - yeah i don't lose at all
49:34 - but anyways yeah i think i think yeah i
49:36 - mean what usually happens is we we
49:39 - usually we say
49:39 - we usually say something about it
49:41 - something bad and then we usually get
49:43 - used to it right away
49:44 - normalize it that's usually what happens
49:46 - so you know you kind of have to
49:47 - something to set the trend sometimes for
49:49 - like for example the usb thunderbolt
49:52 - right that became like a
49:53 - like a trend right pretty much anything
49:55 - else became a trend right so
49:57 - um i think just a matter of you know
49:59 - just a matter of time that's it
50:01 - so that's that's recapping this whole
50:03 - podcast trendsetter
50:05 - yeah what's up companies follow apple so
50:09 - if they are going to bring out this
50:11 - colorful max then every single company

something this is if this is really cool for you i think this is awesome that hinge wait can i get like another view okay let's see let's see it says hello say hello to the new imac inspired by the best of apple transformed by the m1 chip uh stands out in my space profits perfectly into your life yes yes yes that's not bad honestly from 29 that's not bad at [Laughter] i all know about are you taking it back or whatnot i don't know about this guys [Laughter] i don't know i don't know what changed your mind dude you were so hyped on it what happened i was hyped on it but i'm looking at these colors for those of you who are on audio experience i'm looking at all these colors right now and i don't know it just looks like cha childish yeah i thought it looks like childhood but i guess they have a silver version like i said where's the silver version because i'll buy that version this whole thing with like the white and like this portion oh man i don't know i mean i don't know what do you guys think what do you guys think what do you guys think let us know in the comments below what you guys think of this i'm very curious crazy how flat it is though it's really really flat i'm surprised on that portion i will say yeah because for the processor now it's replaced by amazon 11.5 millimeters that's the now that's thin that is thin it's a shortened design and one chip the system and when i took its processor graphics into a single chip that's awesome i love that portion um what else i love their just website design by the way it's just oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa that color look at this oh that's like that's like a magnet oh [ __ ] easily attaches via magnets i like that animation that's cool animation right yeah brilliant 4.5 4.5 key right on display what wow that is sick let's see what else we got they also released like the pro display like the apple pro display i don't know how did they do that bro sorry for interrupting you but this user experience is crazy like you're scrolling down how do they think that is insane dude that is insane sorry bro so what were you saying man i was saying that they also released some display like prores displays like apple sells their own display i guess yeah yeah yeah they have some improvements on that too yeah yeah yeah turkish stun is like 4.5 key display i don't know would be cool for us to be able to figure out how we can do this in css or like like that's possible i'm sure it's [ __ ] is what what is what's going on here they're zooming in it says it's screaming but the thing is it's not a screen like keep scrolling up like in the beginning it's not a screen like scroll up scroll down i mean no no no scroll the other way so at first it's like the typical css transition or when you scroll down you see like the background image right like scroll down sorry sorry when i say scroll down i mean like go down on the website yeah so it's just like the typical background image as an embedded yeah yeah yeah yeah and then when they zoom out and they make it look like the screen that looks james james foreman says it's a 3d library that's really interesting yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah do you happen to know what a library is yeah yeah yeah this is cool holy [ __ ] i just don't like this does i don't like this division right here this is what i don't like the color no there's division between the this right here you see the division between the yellow and the white i don't like this division it just looks odd to me that's it you know hey neil patel just said they want to see this clone we gotta close this dude that'd be a good challenge man wait so auto balance studio quality mics oh [ __ ] okay well the new macbook pros have the studio quality mics as well so you know they always heard that yeah six speaker sound system audio that really fills a room whoa six speakers what the [ __ ] this stuff you know look how tiny these things are bro like it has to fit into how thin that thing is i don't oh yeah that's insane to me the sound system on amex brings an incredible room filling audio to any space yeah i guess i just don't my macbook pro goes like two days of battery life without dying what's up does what my macbook pro goes like two days of battery life without dying two days on battery without dying wow yeah that's do you have the ammo do you have the m1 chip at harvard yeah he just said he did yeah i have that oh that's awesome that is sick is that shown on top in the live yeah okay gotcha so that okay okay cool yeah let's make sure yeah it's showing us yeah so what do we got what do we have uh so we got this m1 and big sur with great power i do love the m1 chips that's awesome that means safari faster than ever i mean of course but i don't use safari that's for sure even the transition that as you're scrolling down and it's showing like other things what the how i like it dude how you see you guys see this right here i mean i mean if we can actually take a look at how how does this is done like like if you want the user experience wait it's stopped hold on oh it's the second it wanted me it was like all this guy's trying to find uh you know the loophole into how we do this stuff he's on to us he's on to us oh so hold on hold on if i refresh this that's so interesting what's up frankie hey what's up everybody how are we doing hey beautiful beautiful all right so let's see what else do we got let's see give me one two yeah okay so look okay so i see okay i got this guy so i got this i'm gonna go i'm gonna do it like this okay i'm gonna take out the inspect element i'm gonna take out the actual i'm gonna undock it right here so here's we have now got the code right here so if we have this code okay right here okay so what's going on here let's see we have here this and as i scroll it transforms so you can see on the right they they have this matrix right here so they do in order for us to be able to properly see transformation they have a matrix look at this bro you see this they have a matrix yeah you have a matrix and i'm doing transform so as i scroll opacity changes you see yep and then this is a little javascript bro i 100 know it and then it's cool wait the [ __ ] the image does not change like there's also some json data into that html what else changes hold on whoa oh no this is this is interesting this is this will be a good those of you guys who are listening to this would be awesome for you guys to take a look take a look at this actually um yeah and when we scroll it will change right yes it does change it that's the crazy part look at this that looks nice dude it looks like the waterfall effect how the f [ __ ] that transition is just so smooth i don't know how they do it so crispy clean because here it is it's it's this thing oh right here so it'll they're all doing through something called the matrix look at this i just wanna um let me go put this on here oh wait it's all going through a matrix so if i scroll on here see there's something called transform matrix if i go here it's the h2 so as i scroll boom dude that's cool crazy man it's crazy how crazy css has gotten to where css takes care of some of those animations yeah i know things you could start to do you know can i do transform trans form matrix on here so if i did if i do matrix transform let's see transforming matrix in css so css css2d transforms is what you're going to use matrix for so if i do okay so i can rotate i can rotate i can skew is there like uh what about what about matrix though like a matrix set what the [ __ ] is the matrix i don't know click on it let's see where it takes us i won't click oh i need to find it first there it is right there the matrix method combines all the 2d transform methods into one ah okay it's like the skill the skew the skill y all the translate watch oh so translate what is the last one that's like when you when i go into here let me go back into my code the code now i'm like about their code you see this right here stays the same but what's actually going on is this number this is translate why this right here is changing the y on the this so basically for those of you who are listening i really wish we had more people on in clubhouse guys if you are on clubhouse guys join us on the club clever programmer can we share it somehow can i share this actually this link somehow um if you could copy it to your computer you could drop it in that chat let me see yeah go ahead search room not andrew audio quality normal you guys interested join this room right here is it not coping into your mac or what so i thought just air drop it to your mac then air drop come on air drop come on copy all right okay that's gonna work nope give us one second guys we're getting that link for you guys get you guys on clubhouse if you guys i mean okay please send the chat link okay you got it guys send a airdrop let's see copy copy pasta text it to yourself texting myself i don't i don't do texting here i do copy pasta my pro this one is that yours would you a pasta copy pasta i got it okay i got it i got it got it got it got it right here here i'll give you guys the link right here guys so you guys can see it boom that's the room for those of you who are interested okay pasta yo david what is going on brother oh this is within clever programmer by the way so you can if you guys simply just go ahead and join clever program that's all you gotta you guys gotta do awesome sweet so that's cool i like that so i make has apps just about everything mac iphone i'm actually i want to ask you a question what do you think about this whole m1 chip system because it's running a completely different system right like even for example for all these other apps they have to use emulators like what do you think about this i'm curious like the future of of what apple just did with the m1 chip gotcha so so i guess i do you mean it's basically a different os and it runs the emulator of the old one or whatever the os right now is the same right the last right now is the same it's what has changed is is very simple what has changed is i think the i don't know how it because for example it's kind of like a different less system because for example if i you know it's kind of like when i do ubuntu and if i want to run a windows application i use an emulator they're doing that with the m1 chip on the mac os system so for any for example yeah so for any for example um you know for any not project but for any application that is not m1 chip compatible they're they emulate oh that's dope dude that is dope because now they have more compatibility with the whole thing's got you exactly yo that is cool i didn't know that was what was going on really didn't know that you didn't know that yeah so like i just i just thought the m1 chip was just jacked and it was like super powerful i didn't know it was all not backwards compatible so so to deal with backwards compatibility meaning to deal with applications that wouldn't be able to use this new technology what they did is they run the old applications on emulators yeah yeah yeah yeah you didn't know that really crazy dude yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so fun part is that the ability applications are actually running faster than the actual intel application no way dude wait what'd you say so you see emulated emulated apps are running way more faster than the original apps which are used in the intel mobile yeah so like they need the new yeah the new ones are just running a lot more faster yeah so let's see the m1 chip is an air on processor not x86 processor it integrates more components than an intel cpu yeah together you see so that's why it has to has to run it differently double one one also integrates around the same package it features rosetta dynamic binary translation the tube boasts eight cpu cores in addition to the integrated gpu it is manufactured using five nanometer processors that has 16 billion resistors that's a lot of resistors actually um dude that's jacked bro that's all that's that's crazy crazy i actually didn't know that was what was going on man yeah no bro yeah that's awesome we have do you want a person one person abrar in the clubhouse let's go yeah let's just talk to him let's see go ahead and wait to sleep he's i feel like david should be able to just pop up to the top yeah yeah david dear what's up my friend what are you saying bro [Laughter] m1 um noncompatible double applications too good to be true plenty so they're not compatible yes respond you have to check i want capability for a mac with this yeah there is no app that is not compatible with it there's the rosetta which does the heartbreak yes there's a lot like even photoshop is compatible as now yeah yeah i i mean it's going to take them time it's going to take time for all these applications to be compatible but yeah uh for those those that are not compatible it's ready running rosetta stone rosetta stone to be able to make them competitive basically it's an emulator rosetta stone i think it's called rosetta stone what is that what it's that something totally called or is that a rosetta stone is like to learn a language dude you want to pick up spanish you get the rosetta stone somebody says no doubt apple's worth 2.23 trillion dollars yes i i i would not be um yeah it is worth a lot i will say guys it is worth a lot a lot exactly but just dropped that i don't look at that i don't look at i don't look at the short uh yeah i look at the long term the long term from apple has always been up so that to me doesn't matter too much exactly so let me see i mean short term after every apple even it drops so yeah emulator oh i just i just buy my apples from costco that's it looks apple silicon m1 mla x86 is still faster than every other mac and single core benchmark no [ __ ] way wow that's insane the first native benchmarks of apple appeared on the green bench uh site last week showing impressive native performance today new benchmarks have begun showing up for the m1 chip emulating x86 under rosetta two separate other two is what what what it's called right yes um so let's take a look at it thank you intel for playing yeah good luck good luck so we have what so the eight chords are the what the that's crazy wow what's up what's up no there's a ssd problem in this mac like the swap usage is waste way too much and people are complaining about this is getting degraded quickly really that's interesting yeah but the swap usage is only only big if you are doing heavy workload and you only have the eight gigabyte ram version so if you have the 16 it's all good yeah i mean i didn't have any issues but people on twitter are just going like boom like yeah yeah yeah yeah i've never had this max so the new rosetta 2 geekbench results uploaded showed that the m1 chip running a macbook air with 8 gigs of ram has a single core and multiscores of one thousand hundred and five thousand eight hundred eighty three respectively since this version of geekbench is running through apple's translation layers are the two an input performance as to be expected reset the two running x86 appears to be achieving 78 percent the performance of native apple silicon code wow that's crazy despite the impact on performance the single core resulted to rise up to scores though still outperforms any other intel mac including 2020 no [ __ ] way so basically we need to get the m1 oh yeah what are we doing bro let's go get the m1 get the m1 chip put it on everything i mean i mean my macbook is doing great is yours m1 no no it's intel damn but yeah funny story about a funny story about my funny story i kind of actually actually tell the story yeah it kind of came free by surprise surprise anyways yeah so uh okay cool cool cool that's awesome yeah so yeah so what do you think about i'm very curious like what what do you think about you know where this m1 chip is going to go this m1 um you know um like what are they doing to the industry the next thing is the m2 bro obviously i have two i mean i get it i get it but like what do you think is gonna happen like because i think what i've done is something really interesting right uh they've completely outperformed any any other what's it called um you know processor processor out there pretty much right um yeah but if you think about it like they already have it in the iphone in the ipad like it's the same architecture yeah like every other phone is there that's true that's true they have it in the in the iphone they add in and so forth i just think that what's really cool for me is just seeing the future of this right because yeah the thing is the thing is this just kind of showed everybody how intel sucks right so um exactly right i need to i mean intro could do it too i mean or maybe this can lead to intel creating their own computer like in their future plans they don't have any um based processor in the in the coming years like they have just announced it wait wait what are you saying what are you saying i mean they don't plan to make armbased chips in like the near future oh they don't plan to make any more processors in the near future no no our arm arm base like this this kind of process like the m1 because right now like like you said uh the ram and the processor is on the same chip with the m1 yeah and and and intel is only selling standalone chips and that's why that's why it gets outperformed interesting interesting oh look at what they just released by the way look at the they released it the ipad pro got an update right there so the ipad pro m1 chip 12.9 inch liquid retina xdr that's on with center stage what is that supposed to mean dude that's like the firm facing camera is gonna follow you if you move around and when you are on facebook do you see this bro the animations the amazing so good but i mean it's all software because it's an ultraviolet camera and they just softwarebased like crop in focus hold on hold on david david we're we're talking about the ui experience here on this on this on this on this website look at this this is by far the most insane experience i've ever had oh [ __ ] wow oh my god it gets better wait wait wait oh oh oh oh oh omg on the last one bro omg 5g omg oh my god guys who think this is who who thinks who wants to see this clone guys it might be like a video playing in the background when you scroll it wow oh that's a good point do you hear what he said yeah what's up what's up it's just a video i don't think it's i don't know no it's not really because it look it's scrollable you see so like i don't know i don't think yeah oh you think so like that you can scroll it and i'll pull up the code again pull up the code again doesn't see it looks like it's a video let's see we're gonna test it by looking at the code oh no it's an image no these are all images that are just this is all crazy animations all right this is sticky overflow do you see anything changing cause i don't see anything anything changing in terms of matrix wise bro they're hiding it they're good they're [ __ ] good as well i'll tell you like yeah because what we're looking at right now is just all these animations that are going on when you when you're on the ipad page and there's just there's just honestly how are you doing hi hold on you gotta invite them bro chill i thought cause my dance teacher by the way oh listen she's at my dance teacher in uh in michigan nice this is awesome wow i know she left it's cause the people that join us in clubhouse yeah yeah if they're coming from not from youtube like from clubhouse yeah they don't know we're just on youtube experiencing this i think we just have to figure out like a better integration with cl like i love the fact that we could bring people into clubhouse like atari and then just have a conversation we have to figure out something there with the audio video okay i think i mean i mean because he also sees everything a couple seconds behind than we do that is sure true that's true but you know we'll figure something out that's okay we'll fix it so it looks like we're looking right now it says faster performance and and graphics the 8 core cpu m1 delivers up to 50 percent faster what i'm curious about is actually not this processor speed i'm not just curious about the battery life on this thing damn look at all those it's more than like two days like it's two days my my board my macbook pro doesn't die i mean it never dies i feel like i feel like the ipad would last what's up man i'm doing great how are you guys then chilling out on clubhouse i guess yeah on youtube too oh [ __ ] you guys are on youtube yeah yeah you just got recorded cussing on youtube amanda good job oh [ __ ] do you see this so what's going on is it moving hold on as he's moving it's moving the camera yeah that's what david that is so smart yeah that's what i said oh [ __ ] you guys are watching the apple event huh yeah like the imac like that's the best thing like yeah yeah yeah this is awesome this is so good i love this portion so lighter the lighter scanner measures how long it takes light to reflect back from objects so they can create a depth map of any space you're in and unlock immersive immersive with immersive ar experiences and it works with the powerful asp to market guys if by the way guys if you guys have any questions let us know in the comments below we'll definitely be able to you know we'll definitely uh talk with you about that so a thunderbolt a port that's ready to rumble that's interesting that's interesting for sure let me see what's my next call my next close by one thirty so i'm good okay thunderbolt ported to rumble yeah thunderball is just crazy i will say that it's a crazy crazy insane is this a thunderbolt now you got the m1 on an ipad what the hell is better oh they finally have the the white version of the keyboard damn i don't think did they have the white version of the keyboard beforehand or no yeah it's a new it's new it's a new one right hell yeah yeah that's awesome now their keyboards have like touch id for the imacs yeah wow i mean we have that right now so like that's what this is right here but it's not as cool as this one wow it doesn't have an animation with it yeah i also see a lot of future in the ipad west sn2 by the way like i now use my ipad as a macbook as a computer now because like i can do the whole command space searching i can shift normally between different different things like you know like this stuff right here i can shift normally it's so it's so seamless it's so easy like it's literally almost like you're making it it's literally almost on my microphone like damn okay i can have my windows open everything something you said now with the m1 you could be like color grading videos and video editing stuff there's a new reconfiguration offers more two terabytes [ __ ] dude go to the pricing bro let's let's let's jack it up and see how let's do it gonna do it the most expensive one what do we got here 12.9 inch okay so first of all let's do some spaces two terabytes two terabytes let's that will only decrease the cost that won't decrease two thousand two thousand four hundred that's not bad oh my god sonny said do you know what library to use to make these cool transitions i mean i mean you know there's multiple libraries you can use we can definitely definitely do like a podcast at some point to figure out what library you can use together something like this yeah do you know there's like a video editing library for javascript what's up there is a video editing library for javascript oh yeah i know i i thought it was coming out coming out recently um it was like wait what was that name actually i couldn't remember that's so cool we had like five people we have my thumb people come and go come on guys oh someone just jumped on where oh he did oh man thank him who's maitam do i know you dude we went to uh we all done together we had uh me you and um that was a steve and robert [Laughter] oh [ __ ] damn it's been a while it's bad amazing no remember holy [ __ ] how you doing man i'm doing really good i uh still in the blocking world are you still in the blockchain world dude that's crazy she's absolutely not are you in dogecoin you know like i every time i'm like you know i should put money in it i'm literally working in this business bro just put the [ __ ] money into it man don't wait gotta gotta learn how to take rent i put in uh let me see i put it myself i put in 500 into into dosh coin and then show them the money i put into 100 i mean it is currently i put in 500 it is i am up 2 800 right now damn son that's all right that's crazy that's not bad huh i mean that's pretty good that's not bad at all i mean compared to some people who have like eighty thousand dollars you know that's up you know so like you make some crazy cash on this i'm like what the hell i know i mean just didn't say 500 and you got like 2008 2 800 from the yeah right 2 800 return yeah yeah yeah yeah black magic of something yeah it was literally what is it like a third of a cent like a month ago like two months ago and now it's thirty three steps i think it will go up to a dollar you think so what do you think i mean you you choice i mean i mean daniel you trade stocks here daniel yeah i don't i don't trade crypto though ah it's the same [ __ ] it's the same stuff it's the same thing i mean not same stuff but you know but yeah yeah the market is the market the market is the market yeah i mean i don't know go ahead [Laughter] circle church he was just collecting the commissions that's what he was doing not going to that axis so now guys so guys raise your hand here uh who is a believer in in in uh in coins when you say raise your hand here crypto are you tying youtube are you talking clubhouse you too and clubhouse you can raise your hand too right oh yeah you could raise your hand on clubhouse you can raise your hand you see so raise your hand on android i cannot change my hand but yeah here we go do you believe in crypto i'm on android i'm gonna do that thing yeah yeah blockchain's pretty dope yeah yeah so methamphetamine why why are you so why are you so into crypto tell me okay so first of all i've wanted to get out of script for a while and give it to ai dude the money's too good it's just like i'm like i hate what i do and i want to move but like they sell cash in my face i'm like god damn it again wait what do you what are you still what are you still doing because i i remember the last time is that you were traveling around like europe or some or some something i remember and you were and you had you were like you were doing i could already forgot you do consulting for some guy and crypto or some some stuff like that correct what i actually meant making like a long time ago back when we were doing some stuff with robert and steve actually like guys how are you finding me robert was on the youtube live call yesterday it's crazy you're on clubhouse today with me i need to get steve on here now you got the uh people yeah yeah yeah wow isn't he already on what's up i think these are let me look at i think steven is following me yeah yeah yeah yeah but anyways so what do you what do you do right now tell me mathem okay so back back in the day i used to do like straight ups about mixing if you want to build something on ethereum i would say that like temporary project manager role right um i gotta come up with a lot of banks like traditional institutions and these guys were like all across europe all across asia i went to korea a few times lived in europe for like about a year um so that was like that was living the highlight but dude i spent like every amount of money i made i just spent a party wait you split you spent on what partying partying like yeah oh so you're a party all the time i was partying like here's the thing if you want to become a consultant it's not about what you know about who you know and the way i got science was straight up going to party and meeting these like crypto guys and like having fun with them and then like if they like you they'll give you their business so so so what did you say in terms of because in terms of consulting did you basically basically help them start a coin like have their own you know ico you you know what what did you have them start with initially with ico ico sure okay but then what i transitioned into was helping helping traditional institutions get out of blockchain yeah and that might have included like one of my olympic clients was they wanted to build an exchange for tokenized securities like poker night stocks tokenized companies chairs and they needed to be fcc regulated and they also needed to work with blockchain so bridging that gap between regulation and blockchain technology was kind of my job yeah let's see what you like i literally went read like act like like law passed by congress like straight up started reading like 500 pages and kind of like talked with both the bullyers and the technology guys come up with a plan yeah um so it was getting a pretty good knowledge how much let me ask this question how much were you making how much will we make it per month on the consulting i was i remember 14 20 sometimes 20 000 that was for one year though yeah so 20 000 a month you're making from consulting on uh ico that was max that was like the knack that made first that's not bad yeah yeah from consult consulting for consulting coins it's not bad at all yeah okay you get to party and make 20k bro that's that's a good life wait are you are you in usa right now i know yeah i'm in detroit actually oh detroit oh [ __ ] well i'll come out here to la you know whenever you never get the chance i know i know you're in like you look at your linkedin profile you're uh dude i i knew you're always like you're you're always saying how you want to teach people i remember that i really had that fire you need to do it yeah and you're doing that right yeah yeah that's what we do is we now we now teach people what basically some somebody said mr beast is here oh let's go mr beast [Laughter] yeah like i mean it's it's been crazy it's been one of my for some reason from one of my goals in life has always been to teach for some reason i don't know why but and and i loved it and because my mom was actually a teacher when i was in her belly like when i was just pregnant with me she was teaching damn so it's in your bed bro it's literally in my blood you know and then i kind of started out that would make sense why not as a really good teacher like he's he from the womb he got the teaching skills exactly exactly and it was crazy you know what's crazy is that i went um at one point i think two months ago i was talking with my mom and we kind of shared our experiences in terms of how our teaching styles and we didn't know this but apparently we have the exact same teaching styles mean her oh [ __ ] yeah you picked them up from the womb bro from you from anybody in your in your by the way uh david not daniel [ __ ] david's not here daniel anybody from your you know from your family does like engineering it's like that i mean not like my whole family's engineering bro your whole family is yeah oh really yeah interesting all of them now it's starting to make sense it's like my dad and my grandson and everybody has been in sales and marketing now it makes everything adds up really for me because i love more marketing than software development it's interesting it's different here it's different here my parents are doctors but i'm not there you go you change that you change the game you change the game be like nope not going you're out not good by the way who knows before the i'm curious for the apple that we have madonna today was it live or was it like uh people in there um no it was i think like it was like a prerecorded because you guys do you guys know how good these prerecorded ones are they're [ __ ] amazing let me show you it's not like a hollywood movie is it really hollywood is it really that good let's watch it yeah and uh too good and there was a scene where that guy went let's just watch it together hold on hold on hold on is there is there any audio here or no i hope there is i mean we cannot see anything clubhouse look at this wow all these animations this is insane what music oh there you go oh that's not that that's that no oh it is that holy moly look at this so they basically wow this is a new campus or what yeah this is a new campus yeah yeah oh my god it's so good first event after the challenges of this past year optimistic that brighter days are just in front of us okay let's see as we move forward we feel it's important that apple continues to make a difference in people's lives through our products and our values yes so we're glad you could join us today for some exciting updates and i love it this week martial i thought they did it outside it's really cool and i couldn't be more proud of the environmental initiatives and commitments at the air tech today yeah apple is global corporate operations with all of our offices stores and data centers running on 100 renewable energy wow and by 2030 apple will be 100 carbon neutral across our entire endtoend footprint including our supply chain and the use of our products that's cool this month i love the little german sounds in partnership with conservation international and goldman sachs this pioneering new investment fund will provide returns that are measured not only financially but by the tons of atmospheric carbon removed by each investment our goal is to remove more than one million tons of carbon every year at apple that was a lot of value they drive us it's like he's trying to read the next line because he probably has a prompter you know and more enjoyable and like no i'd like to turn to something like no editor do the whole thing beginning with apple car i do it with apple card we set out to completely reinvent the credit card i didn't enable so good to live a healthier finance love it what's the difference our customers are like i can really see my monthly like transactions where i spend most of my money like the most successful categories so good i love it one of the things that became apparent to us in the beginning was a lack of fairness in the way the industry calculated credit scores i don't know when there were two holders of a credit card real quick one got the benefit of and then turn up the volume again nathan what we're saying nathan what are you saying oh i said i use the wallet the apple wallet i don't know functionality no no we're talking about the apple cart it's a little bit different so what's the apple wallet that's usually if a wall is just your normal standard apple wallet you can put your credit cards in there your credit card so if i if i double click on this thing see you've got all these apple i have look at this from my apple cart i have got 443 dollars from cashback cash because it's three percent yeah cash back it's three percent cash back three percent cash back on things like you buy from apple and a few other different things like oh but what's like the regular cash back two percent two percent oh [ __ ] that's not bad enough that's really good actually that's right so yeah so like 400 look i got 450 cashback cash back damn bro that's insane anyways let's continue on yeah building a good a really credit history what do you what do you say nathan sorry if you guys want a really good credit card american express blue cash preferred gives you six percent back on groceries oh wow um i've been using that dude it's it's just printing money oh gotcha gotcha gotcha interesting yeah for sure okay for sure for sure money man print that money these credit cards i love it but yeah it's pretty cool i think what they've done so like well i do like really like the air tech and stuff like that i think that's really cool that would be awesome wow wow wow wow listen i'm gonna i'm gonna let me know definitely come back come in come back okay all right awesome cool well i mean i think this has been a uh a fun one we have definitely you know this epi one is really interesting i think we've talked about the m1 chip i think there's a lot of future with that you know that that's gonna go forward um i'm really excited about where the future heads out with all these like uh you know more m1 products i'm on i mean apple's really kind of really kind of gotten really good at what they're doing with other products however i really hope they don't like they make the macbook pro colorful like how they did the imac bro you don't like it no man i just don't like it so is that the only negative review you have right now just the just the colors just the color what do you think i don't know man maybe i'm sad they don't have the pink color bad news they are going to redesign the macbooks later this year no man don't tell me that come on and and they are going to remove the dirty bar that's fine i hate the touch bar yeah i don't use it i don't use it at all but yeah i don't lose at all but anyways yeah i think i think yeah i mean what usually happens is we we usually we say we usually say something about it something bad and then we usually get used to it right away normalize it that's usually what happens so you know you kind of have to something to set the trend sometimes for like for example the usb thunderbolt right that became like a like a trend right pretty much anything else became a trend right so um i think just a matter of you know just a matter of time that's it so that's that's recapping this whole podcast trendsetter yeah what's up
