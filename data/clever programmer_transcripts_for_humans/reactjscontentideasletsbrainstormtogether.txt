01:20 - do you want to see do you want to see us
01:23 - talk about server side or client-side
01:24 - rendering do you want to see us talk
01:26 - more about firebase and authentication

02:25 - on abhishek says server side rendering
02:28 - abhishek says apis okay
02:31 - server side rendering good morning all
02:34 - right it seems like a lot
02:36 - of people are interested in node
02:39 - okay nice yeah yeah go i'm going sorry
02:43 - yeah i was just gonna say that it seems
02:45 - like a lot of people are actually
02:46 - interested in learning about
02:48 - um learning about server side
02:53 - yes yeah yeah i saw a few nodes
02:56 - node.js's and i also saw react with
02:59 - typescript so that's good yeah okay
03:04 - let me see am i all right when i go on
03:06 - this yep my screen is looking
03:09 - beautiful okay so maybe some laps
03:13 - so okay what we're gonna do is we're
03:14 - gonna you guys are gonna code along with
03:16 - us or just watch us code and make some
03:18 - stuff
03:19 - and then as we do that keep typing your
03:22 - ideas
03:22 - uh in here and if you could actually
03:24 - type in as a youtube
03:26 - comment that would be really phenomenal
03:28 - because
03:29 - um then the top voted comments we can
03:31 - just easily see
03:32 - what you guys are looking for or david
03:34 - we can make like a little form
03:36 - and they can submit their whatever i
03:38 - think even
03:39 - easier is to put our instagram handle on
03:42 - the screen
03:43 - and then just have people vms
03:46 - how about that that's not that becomes
03:49 - like then we have to go through all of
03:51 - them i want it in a way where we can
03:52 - easily see you know what i mean like
03:54 - what ideas they like the best we have
03:56 - some people saying
03:58 - um node and apis yeah we have more node
04:04 - jwt and aws lamba lambda
04:07 - [Music]
04:09 - nice okay okay let's
04:12 - uh we got a ton of django projects okay
04:14 - okay or we have
04:15 - one person who's telling who's like kind
04:18 - of django projects
04:19 - so let's just let's just while we sit
04:21 - here and
04:22 - chat let's build something and work on
04:25 - this together with them so like people
04:27 - can learn some skills as well
04:29 - and just have fun so one of the things i
04:31 - see a lot that happen in interviews and
04:33 - even a lot of the interviews i'm
04:34 - conducting
04:36 - is i'm checking for your skills
04:38 - obviously with like algorithms i'm also
04:40 - checking your skills and how you deal
04:41 - with apis
04:43 - api is like one of the common things
04:44 - interviewers are going to check you on
04:46 - and it's also one of the most important
04:47 - parts of your job
04:49 - so yes 100 it's probably good that you
04:52 - should know about them and are
04:54 - comfortable with them
04:56 - yeah so yeah like apis are so powerful
04:58 - like you don't have to code up all those
05:00 - kind of stuff you just like
05:02 - api and that's that's it works
05:05 - right so let's uh create react app and
05:08 - let's create a react
05:09 - app here so i'm going to remove this
05:11 - file because react at will complain if
05:14 - you have a file
05:14 - let's try it now okay cool so it should
05:17 - be working
05:19 - and then let's open up chrome bring that
05:23 - also i just made a super quick form
05:26 - on to so that you guys can actually
05:29 - submit so i will drop it in the chat
05:31 - right now so bang
05:35 - just guys go ahead uh check out that
05:38 - link i'll drop it like
05:39 - two or three times in there so you guys
05:41 - can actually see it
05:43 - and just drop whatever technology or
05:45 - something you guys are interested in
05:47 - and then we can like see it okay oh
05:49 - that's smart
05:50 - that's really really smart awesome let
05:53 - me actually click on that so we can show
05:55 - it to people
05:56 - yeah that's a really good way yeah
05:59 - exactly that's
06:00 - so simple i love it so guys yeah just go
06:02 - here to this form
06:04 - uh the url is right there
06:07 - i mean hopefully it's in the youtube
06:09 - description or in the comments add it to
06:11 - the youtube description if you could
06:12 - please
06:13 - okay and just drop in like what are you
06:16 - interested in right so it's like
06:17 - next js is it typescript is it
06:21 - um you know it's you want to see airbnb
06:23 - clone
06:24 - um whatsapp clone you know
06:27 - uh what discord clone a lot of them
06:30 - we've already done
06:31 - tesla clone um so it's it's not just
06:35 - clones but it's also like
06:36 - what types of projects do you want to
06:38 - see what type of tech stack do you want
06:40 - to see
06:40 - do you want to see payment
06:42 - authentication in there do you want to
06:43 - see stripe do you want to see
06:46 - you know different types of back ends
06:50 - like mongodb versus what what else like
06:52 - some people
06:53 - yeah firebase just a comparison of
06:56 - all the databases right
07:01 - awesome so that's right there for you
07:03 - guys check it out whenever you want
07:05 - david i was going to tell you actually
07:07 - one thing that's super cool that i found
07:08 - is called uh
07:09 - json placeholder.typeycode do you know
07:12 - about this
07:14 - not really so um what's super cool about
07:17 - this website is
07:19 - you can go and get fake apis that you
07:21 - can like request right away
07:23 - bang yes that's good so for
07:26 - teaching people this is really really
07:28 - helpful so for example if we want people
07:30 - to get more comfortable with apis and
07:32 - how they work let's say i want to get
07:33 - this
07:34 - post i want to get all of the posts
07:38 - right so let's say that i'm here on this
07:40 - and it has
07:43 - a bunch of posts it seems like it has a
07:45 - hundred posts on here right
07:48 - so if i want to be able to get all of
07:50 - these hundred posts
07:52 - let's go inside of our app.js and uh
07:55 - what we'll do
07:56 - is i'll do yarn start so we'll whip this
07:59 - app up real quick
08:02 - and i want you guys to get a lot of
08:03 - practice with these things because the
08:05 - more practice you get the better you're
08:06 - gonna become
08:07 - at it exactly it's all about the reps
08:13 - cool so we got this and if i
08:16 - make it smaller david is it still easy
08:18 - for you to be able to see my screen
08:20 - uh quickly check can you guys still read
08:24 - my code easily
08:27 - yeah i think it's good okay awesome
08:31 - so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go
08:33 - ahead and
08:35 - you know when i'm reading data from an
08:37 - api request
08:39 - there are simple ways to do it and one
08:42 - of the ways is really easy to just write
08:44 - fetch
08:45 - and then call your whatever
08:48 - you have uh so let's let me get my url
08:52 - this one right there yeah
08:55 - so that's the first thing i want to do
08:57 - and then
08:58 - i can just do that then and
09:02 - chain it with things okay exactly
09:05 - so here
09:10 - let's see i think that's
09:13 - one of the things they also
09:18 - that's the thing that i always like i
09:20 - have a code where i have all these fat
09:22 - stuff
09:23 - yeah and i always just copy paste that
09:26 - thing
09:27 - i can't remember this let me go like
09:29 - this inspect
09:30 - and let's see what we get back so right
09:33 - now
09:33 - we're getting you might want to move us
09:35 - from the corner of the screen because it
09:38 - literally covers oh my bad
09:41 - yeah boom oh yeah there we go and just
09:44 - zoom in
09:45 - a bit onto my code or what oh oh in the
09:48 - in the comments on the on the console
09:50 - yeah
09:52 - cool
09:55 - boom that's lit all right dang
09:59 - so what what what did we get back here
10:01 - we got some promised state
10:03 - from this but if i actually want to get
10:06 - data from it in real time i think you
10:10 - need to return it
10:11 - i need to return it but also one thing i
10:14 - want to show here for everybody
10:15 - here is because it's a promise you don't
10:18 - want to call it
10:19 - after you you know you get the data back
10:22 - from it because you're not getting the
10:23 - data back you get the promise back and
10:25 - you print it out
10:26 - so where you actually want to add your
10:28 - console log statement
10:29 - is right here
10:34 - oh yeah yeah and we're gonna remove
10:37 - the initial console log statement
10:39 - because we don't
10:41 - we don't need that anymore so here's our
10:43 - fetch request
10:45 - and let's see what we get back
10:55 - what is it giving me cool
10:58 - so we have we have a lot of our results
11:01 - in here like
11:02 - every single thing that we wanted we're
11:04 - getting that
11:05 - back right you see that zero we got post
11:08 - one we got post two
11:10 - so all the posts that we actually need
11:12 - we're able to get back
11:14 - and another thing if you guys are having
11:17 - trouble coming up with this
11:18 - this place can also be a good place for
11:20 - you to go to to just get that initial
11:22 - thing so boom right like
11:26 - yeah type that right so if you can't
11:28 - remember
11:29 - you can go here and get that like
11:31 - initial request so
11:33 - i'm just gonna do post still because i
11:35 - don't want to do the to-do's and let's
11:37 - see what it
11:38 - uh gets us back let's hit refresh
11:42 - boom so i got an array with 100 items
11:46 - and what are those items
11:51 - all those i think user
11:54 - yeah yep we have user and then uh we
11:57 - have a post from each person so 100
11:59 - posts
12:01 - bang yeah and sick
12:06 - how many users do we have actually if
12:07 - you actually look we have
12:11 - i only see ones and twos so user id if
12:14 - you see user ids
12:15 - they actually go from one to ten so
12:18 - there are a hundred basically what this
12:20 - is telling us there's a hundred posts
12:21 - made by ten users
12:26 - you see what i'm saying david yeah yeah
12:29 - oh i need to
12:30 - crank up the resolution resolution how
12:33 - is
12:33 - my screen uh i don't know uh i was
12:36 - watching in a youtube
12:38 - and i was just uh at 480p uh-huh
12:41 - but now it's now it's good okay now now
12:43 - i see everything
12:45 - try to watch it from ecam instead of
12:47 - zoom because
12:49 - or i'm sorry because instead of youtube
12:51 - because you're not going to see it in
12:52 - real time
12:54 - oh that's right you'll be like 40
12:57 - seconds behind
12:58 - everything all right so
13:02 - i want to ask everybody who's here live
13:04 - who
13:05 - feels comfortable being able to
13:08 - fetch data from an api
13:13 - if you don't feel comfortable you should
13:16 - work
13:17 - you should practice it okay i highly
13:20 - recommend that and somebody's saying
13:21 - something really smart abishik says
13:23 - qazi i think you should use use effect
13:24 - because that's what's happening when the
13:25 - page first loads up
13:27 - so good so whenever you guys are doing
13:30 - these types of
13:31 - api requests it's a good idea to use
13:33 - usefx so it only fires off
13:35 - once so david is writing the import
13:40 - statement for
13:41 - is it use effect that's correct cool
13:48 - yeah and then what we'll do is we'll
13:51 - take
13:51 - we'll make a use effect and
13:56 - i'm just gonna close it here and we'll
13:58 - give it a second argument of
14:00 - empty give it an empty dependency
14:06 - yeah but you need to rub yes well i
14:08 - thought it was like a one line implicit
14:10 - return
14:11 - type of action going on but all good
14:13 - cool that's why
14:14 - that's why you should use es7 snippets
14:18 - boom so there we go
14:22 - now it's looking good we have it firing
14:26 - off it only fires off once because of
14:28 - use effect
14:29 - and it's showing up okay so we have all
14:32 - of the 100 posts now if we wanted to we
14:34 - could take the post and we could show it
14:36 - off
14:37 - on the screen
14:41 - so where do you want to go from here
14:43 - david do you want to take these posts
14:45 - and start showing them
14:47 - on the screen i think we could do that
14:50 - yeah in some sort of a table way or
14:54 - i just want to i just want to show it
14:55 - like almost like an interview okay so
14:57 - imagine
14:58 - i'm interviewing you so let's just do
14:59 - like a live interview
15:01 - between you and me okay ouch
15:04 - so let's say that i want you to i want
15:07 - you to
15:07 - just um show me the title of each post
15:12 - and just like throw it on the screen i i
15:13 - don't care about styling or anything
15:15 - i just want you to like splat the title
15:18 - on the screen
15:20 - okay so what i will definitely do
15:23 - is i will create a use state
15:26 - over here on the top because i want to
15:29 - save it somewhere
15:30 - obviously so use state first
15:34 - i need to import it if i learn how to
15:37 - type
15:39 - and now i will just say const and
15:44 - how should i call it um maybe data
15:47 - yeah yeah yeah i'll call it data and
15:50 - then i'll have a set
15:52 - data by the way somebody somebody wrote
15:55 - a pretty awesome comment that said um
15:58 - whoa hold on hold on somebody donated
16:00 - your first donation
16:01 - yeah so we got our first donation thank
16:03 - you so much for that thank you so much
16:05 - really appreciate it and
16:07 - here's a really cool comment so by vocal
16:09 - and vocal says
16:11 - i just started learning react two days
16:12 - ago i'm a larval developer and i went to
16:14 - a job interview and i was asked to write
16:16 - react code i was stunned anyways i
16:19 - decided to start learning
16:21 - react yes let's go i'm so happy that you
16:25 - started learning react okay
16:26 - great that happens a lot guys people are
16:29 - gonna
16:29 - ask you to see your skills so many
16:32 - people are gonna come to you
16:33 - in interviews and ask to see your skills
16:37 - that have you code from scratch so
16:38 - really important exactly you're able to
16:40 - do that and yeah jump on in you're in
16:42 - the right place so keep going david so
16:44 - you got your you got your um using
16:47 - hooks here yes i just
16:51 - declared this hook over here and what i
16:53 - will do
16:54 - is i will add uh the set data
16:58 - over here so i'll just make it a
17:00 - two-liner
17:02 - thing yeah like that and
17:05 - what i will do like after i console
17:07 - logged it
17:08 - i will set the data to j uh and i will
17:12 - throw in json so if i see the correct
17:15 - data
17:16 - happening in the console i will have the
17:19 - correct data
17:20 - in uh in the data hook
17:24 - yeah so as soon as we see this data it
17:27 - seems like you're
17:28 - um you're storing it in data right
17:32 - that's correct exactly that's correct
17:34 - got it okay
17:36 - and next up what i will do is
17:39 - i'll actually get rid of oh no i'll make
17:43 - a line
17:44 - uh after this link
17:47 - in the learn react one and i will just
17:50 - add a p
17:51 - tag hold on no
17:54 - uh before i do that i will
17:58 - because i'm using jsx uh i will start
18:01 - typing in javascript
18:02 - inside of this why don't you remove the
18:05 - entire um
18:06 - react logo and everything do you want to
18:08 - do that or no
18:10 - uh you could leave it if i actually want
18:12 - i actually want to keep the logo
18:14 - but everything else can go okay cool
18:17 - i like the logo me too me too
18:21 - i like the way it looks yeah and
18:24 - i'll just type in data map
18:28 - and can you please open up the console

19:58 - um can i see all of these posts
20:01 - like so so for example i want to see
20:04 - it's a post
20:06 - uh one like that and then post
20:09 - two and post three and so on you see
20:11 - what i'm saying
20:12 - so it should say all the way up to post
20:14 - 100 like that
20:17 - okay um so because we have an
20:21 - id in there which actually indicates uh
20:24 - the number
20:25 - of the post i will use that and what i
20:28 - will do
20:29 - is inside of the p tag i will actually
20:32 - just for styling's sake i will add a
20:35 - strong tag
20:36 - and that was a post and then i'll just
20:39 - throw in
20:40 - the item dot id
20:43 - i think yes and a colon
20:48 - and yeah
20:51 - there you go okay good nice
20:56 - i'm getting all of them give me the
20:58 - emoji you know i like my finger pointing
21:00 - emoji
21:01 - forget about that colon it's too
21:03 - professional for us
21:06 - so okay what kind of image do you want
21:09 - rocket no no no the finger pointing the
21:12 - pointing the finger to the right the one
21:14 - i had
21:15 - okay nice rocket
21:18 - point right yeah that's the one
21:22 - let's see it nice okay clean
21:26 - there we go awesome so
21:29 - we have
21:32 - we have all the titles going on
21:36 - right we have all the titles going on so
21:38 - this is something that
21:39 - in interviews they'll commonly ask you
21:42 - to be able to do
21:43 - guys you would be so surprised how many
21:47 - people fail at this
21:48 - like you will be so surprised how many
21:51 - developers
21:52 - who are working with react apparently
21:54 - for a year
21:56 - and have been doing more or more
21:59 - and went to a boot camp and paid 15
22:02 - 000 can't do something like this
22:06 - like they'll see this and that's like
22:09 - they'll crumble under the pressure or
22:11 - whatever it is but like they won't be
22:13 - able to do something like this now
22:14 - regardless of whether it's because
22:16 - you're scared or because you lack the
22:18 - skill to be able to do this
22:20 - both of them are just as bad so
22:23 - you're gonna need to get used to it and
22:25 - get used to that skill of being able to
22:27 - do it under pressure
22:29 - yeah marla gaming says this is basic
22:32 - isn't it
22:33 - i mean it pretty much is but the reality
22:36 - is that
22:37 - we've interviewed so many people and
22:39 - literally people were failing at this
22:41 - yes so yeah that's
22:44 - it yeah go ahead yeah yeah
22:47 - and just wanted to throw in a an advice
22:50 - to anybody who who actually feel
22:52 - feels like this could be challenging at
22:54 - this point like
22:55 - you saw what i did i was commenting on
22:58 - what i was doing and that actually
22:59 - bought me a little bit of time
23:01 - to think over what i will be doing next
23:04 - and that also gives the interviewer
23:08 - a view of what is going on inside of
23:10 - your head
23:11 - and if if you're going the wrong
23:13 - direction they might
23:15 - might help you because why not yeah
23:18 - that's that's that's pretty important
23:20 - what you just said because
23:22 - if you don't talk out loud
23:25 - it hurts you more than it helps you
23:27 - because exactly
23:29 - i'm gonna be on your side as an
23:30 - interviewer as long as i can hear your
23:32 - thought process
23:33 - i will help you out and you know go
23:35 - along the way because
23:37 - if you're let's say that you know that
23:40 - you have to sum an array right
23:42 - exactly yeah and let's say that you
23:44 - don't remember what the
23:46 - function is called in javascript because
23:48 - in python it's just the function
23:50 - is called sum but in javascript it's
23:51 - like math.sum yeah
23:53 - so if you don't i don't know yeah are
23:56 - you asking
23:58 - no i'm telling you that's what it's
23:59 - called the javascript is called math.sum
24:01 - that's the function for summing an array
24:05 - right right you just do mat that sum and
24:06 - you call it an array you following me so
24:08 - far
24:10 - yeah yeah well what i'm saying is let's
24:12 - just say that like
24:14 - you um you've you forgot what the term
24:18 - for it was now if you're quiet and
24:21 - you're not talking out loud
24:23 - i have no idea what you're looking for
24:25 - so
24:26 - as an interviewer i can't really help
24:28 - you with anything
24:29 - but if you were talking out loud and
24:31 - you're like okay so at this point i need
24:32 - to sum an array and oh man i can't
24:34 - remember the function to sum an array in
24:37 - javascript
24:38 - if you say that out loud now i might
24:41 - just actually tell you oh yeah the
24:42 - syntax for it is math.sum with
24:44 - javascript to do it
24:46 - yeah so or they might just tell you like
24:50 - bro use google and
24:53 - that's something that you wouldn't think
24:54 - of during an interview i guess
24:56 - yeah that's something let me see what we
25:00 - got
25:02 - yeah buddy guys this is gonna be
25:05 - exciting because
25:06 - we're gonna start doing a lot more lives
25:09 - and another thing i wanted to tell you
25:10 - is we're also gonna be doing a challenge
25:14 - for react js this month
25:17 - and this challenge is going to be really
25:19 - really crazy and in the upcoming days
25:21 - we're going to be building some big
25:22 - projects too
25:23 - so like for example uh if you guys have
25:26 - ever wanted to see the amazon clone
25:28 - with redux implemented you're going to
25:31 - be able to see that
25:32 - if you wanted to see airbnb with redux
25:35 - you're going to be able to see that
25:37 - so we're going to be working on some
25:38 - really epic projects
25:41 - along the upcoming days and today we
25:43 - wanted to
25:44 - engage with you and start getting your
25:46 - feedback on like
25:47 - what type of content you're looking for
25:50 - and what you're
25:51 - interested in as well and that's why we
25:52 - created a forum uh where you guys can go
25:55 - and actually
25:56 - type in what it is that you are
25:59 - interested in looking for so here's the
26:00 - form
26:01 - all right that's the url go there
26:05 - type in and let us know what it is what
26:08 - are the things that you're excited about
26:09 - what type of technology you're excited
26:10 - about
26:11 - the more of these we get that's the type
26:13 - of stuff we're gonna make content on so
26:14 - you're gonna you wanna see some banger
26:16 - ass content
26:17 - pop it in here we're gonna make it
26:19 - because you know
26:20 - we deliver all right exactly we already
26:24 - have
26:24 - 20 submissions so that's amazing
26:28 - wow keep it going keep it going this is
26:31 - awesome
26:32 - jonathan says just wanted to say
26:35 - um let me read it here so you guys can
26:37 - see my face he says uh
26:39 - oh let's bring this here too you want to
26:41 - say i found your channel i'm almost done
26:43 - with
26:43 - build slack clone video i managed to
26:46 - follow along and customize that myself
26:48 - learn so much thank you for your efforts
26:50 - beautiful day that's what's up hey
26:52 - that's awesome let's go
26:55 - hey amanita is here let's go
26:59 - let's go modest hey
27:03 - um marlega says is redux overkill for
27:06 - hobby projects
27:08 - i would say yes for 100
27:12 - for squad hold on i would also say that
27:14 - oh sorry
27:15 - okay okay okay okay so i would say if
27:19 - you're
27:19 - building just for the sake of building
27:22 - stuff
27:22 - and to have fun and to learn redux i
27:25 - would say it's an amazing stuff
27:27 - and to just put it onto portfolio and
27:29 - then you can show that okay i can work
27:31 - with redux
27:32 - that is a really that's a really good
27:34 - point so if you want to add it to your
27:36 - portfolio and you want to learn it so
27:37 - that you could do it for a company later
27:39 - yes absolutely learn it but if you're
27:42 - doing it for
27:43 - a freelance project or a hobby project
27:46 - and you're not doing it for a purpose of
27:48 - learning you're using it for a purpose
27:50 - of building something
27:52 - that's not necessary at all i would
27:54 - highly recommend to
27:56 - not work and use redux because
27:59 - dan abramoff the creator of redux wrote
28:03 - five to ten pieces of articles on like
28:05 - why you should not use redux
28:07 - when to use redux when to not use redux
28:09 - read those
28:11 - what you're gonna find out is that
28:15 - it's really good for medium-sized to
28:17 - large-sized applications
28:19 - the boilerplate for simple projects is
28:21 - not that helpful
28:23 - ben ayowa who's another youtuber he made
28:26 - a video
28:27 - called why no longer use redux and in
28:30 - that video he actually talked about
28:32 - that instead of redux and redux saga
28:36 - and redux forms he changed his stack
28:39 - completely
28:40 - what he switched to is he switched to
28:43 - formic
28:44 - f-o-r-m-i-k for forms it's supposed to
28:47 - make your tears go away and all the
28:49 - frustration that comes around forms
28:52 - and he switched from redux to unstated
28:56 - which is a state management library but
28:58 - it makes managing states
28:59 - so easy that you don't even see that
29:02 - you're managing state it literally feels
29:04 - like you're just using hooks
29:05 - and it allows you to manage a global
29:07 - state of your application
29:09 - so maybe for your hobby projects a good
29:12 - stack for you can be formic and unstated
29:14 - um this is a recommendation from ben a
29:17 - watt so
29:19 - wow i didn't even know about these it's
29:22 - amazing
29:23 - yeah so let's see where your projects
29:25 - are the easier you can go back to it
29:27 - later
29:28 - hold on let me um take this thing and
29:30 - move it
29:31 - over real quick so i can show everybody
29:34 - all right so here's
29:35 - so formic build react build forms and
29:38 - react without the
29:39 - so this is so formic is going to make
29:42 - your forms really easy
29:44 - and then you got all the code right here
29:46 - for the form
29:47 - and super super simple looking form i
29:49 - mean this is
29:51 - probably the easiest form you'll ever
29:52 - see and
29:54 - then wait what do they actually have uh
29:57 - do they have uh
29:59 - form validation by the time kaz is
30:01 - searching on the page
30:03 - just quick question drop it in the chat
30:04 - please if you guys are interested in
30:06 - building some sort of project with
30:08 - this because i actually got hyped with
30:10 - formic
30:12 - yeah oh yeah 4mx is sick all right so
30:15 - this is really good
30:16 - now the other thing is unstated
30:20 - okay so let's go here
30:23 - they have our actual website front
30:25 - stated let's click here
30:27 - all right so here's unstated states so
30:31 - simple it goes without
30:32 - saying okay it's so simple they didn't
30:35 - even build a website for it
30:38 - yeah so
30:41 - um what they say is this okay is this
30:44 - better
30:45 - than is unstated better than redux by
30:48 - the way
30:49 - um david clip this part out what i'm
30:52 - about to say right now because this
30:53 - could be a great video with this title
30:56 - okay sounds good okay is unstated
31:00 - better than redux uh it's
31:03 - smaller 40 times smaller it's
31:06 - faster componentize the problem
31:09 - performance
31:10 - it's easier to learn you already will
31:13 - have
31:14 - uh to know react hooks in context just
31:16 - use them to rock
31:17 - it's easier to integrate integrate one
31:19 - component at a time and easily integrate
31:21 - with every react library
31:24 - it's easier to test it's easier to type
31:26 - check its minimal
31:27 - is just react this is how you install it
31:31 - and you guys can see that the usage of
31:33 - it looks
31:34 - simple and uh you know here you're
31:37 - making a container which is kind of like
31:39 - a
31:40 - you know it sounds like a redux store
31:42 - and uh you got your initial state
31:44 - and you're using hooks instead of using
31:48 - stores and reducers and middleware
31:51 - and utilities and all of that so much
31:55 - much much simpler at least in my opinion
31:57 - dang that's so cool yeah
32:01 - so if you want to use it for yourself i
32:04 - think it's a really good idea
32:07 - 100 like definitely have redux on your
32:11 - portfolio
32:12 - if you know it yeah but like for hobby
32:15 - projects forget about that
32:18 - hey yeah for sure
32:22 - let's see what people are saying uh-huh
32:26 - someone wants to build an operating
32:28 - system
32:30 - react hook forms for the when julio says
32:32 - let's see react
32:34 - hook arms
32:42 - performant and excellent easy to
32:44 - validate
32:45 - oh [ __ ] they're like 17
32:48 - 000 uh stars that's dope
32:52 - take a look at four make two and see if
32:54 - you still like these better if you still
32:55 - like these better then definitely go
32:56 - with them
32:57 - go with this
33:01 - that looks pretty dope too yeah they're
33:03 - fun
33:06 - i like their front end that they did for
33:08 - this they did a great job
33:10 - yeah oh [ __ ] look at that
33:15 - look at that touched feels will display
33:17 - here touched
33:19 - oh [ __ ] if i touch mobile number they'll
33:22 - show me
33:24 - dang damn
33:28 - that's pretty cool hosted on versal and
33:31 - versailles is amazing for hosting
33:33 - i'm like such a such a huge fan
33:36 - performance is an important aspect of
33:37 - using terms of building you will have
33:38 - the ability to subscribe to individual
33:39 - input changes without re-rendering the
33:41 - entire form
33:42 - watching damn
33:46 - for marketing that's really really good
33:51 - okay this is a really good find thank
33:54 - you for that
33:54 - i appreciate that uh bishal says i use
33:59 - formic yup for form validation
34:02 - hey let's go got some people in here who
34:06 - know what they're talking about
34:08 - that's what's up let's go
34:12 - uh-huh
34:15 - nice
34:19 - i'm a complete beginner by the way still
34:21 - struggling
34:22 - don't worry like literally join these
34:25 - sessions and just make a habit yes
34:28 - of yourself coding every single day two
34:32 - hours
34:32 - i know you have two hours like screw
34:35 - watching movies and netflix
34:37 - yeah spend some time coding every single
34:39 - day you'll become
34:41 - so good you'll become you'll enjoy it
34:45 - and yeah i mean those are two most
34:48 - important things
34:49 - you just get in the habit of it by
34:52 - doing it then you'll hopefully start
34:54 - enjoying it
34:56 - exactly and by the way we have almost 30
34:59 - submissions for the forum
35:01 - guys it is down below in the description
35:03 - one simple question
35:04 - nothing crazy whatever you want us to
35:07 - build for you
35:08 - i'll drop it there can you send me the
35:11 - form in
35:12 - chat david so i can see where it is oh

35:24 - cool just send it to me yeah i'll lead
35:27 - you to it
35:33 - bam invite by link
35:41 - the use of java and react together we'll
35:44 - not show probably java and react
35:46 - together but we might at some point show
35:48 - python and react together
35:52 - that would be sick yeah cause i know a
35:55 - lot of people
35:56 - love the idea of that yeah just sent you
35:59 - the
36:00 - uh airtable invitation on skype
36:04 - okay let's so you can join

36:25 - yep so thank you guys you guys are
36:26 - making your submissions i'm loving that
36:29 - really really appreciate those so we got
36:32 - people saying
36:33 - typescript uh next.js apis blog with
36:37 - mern
36:38 - react redux okay data science with
36:42 - python
36:44 - charts nice web development okay
36:51 - beautiful aws
36:54 - paypal api is a good one yeah disney oh
36:58 - disney clone yo we should make disney
37:01 - clone with netcast that is
37:02 - hot hot hot that is fire
37:06 - everyone i think we actually have it
37:09 - some in some kind of planning
37:11 - so it's kind of in the works okay cool
37:14 - yeah cause i was gonna say this
37:16 - dope uh robin hood clone but done
37:19 - correctly with bang
37:20 - because we had a lot of technical
37:22 - difficulties on that one
37:24 - i mean robin hood has a probably a good
37:27 - amount of difficulties so we we maybe
37:29 - should just go with weeble
37:34 - all right cool let's see we got django
37:38 - tutorials i think they will do well too
37:39 - let's see what else typescript
37:43 - real-time apis okay
37:46 - how to make code editor headless
37:49 - e-commerce yeah so i was actually
37:51 - looking into this too
37:52 - a lot which is um like strappy and
37:55 - sanity i o are great headless cms
37:58 - platforms and you can use that to create
38:00 - a react
38:01 - type of uh store so yeah i think this
38:04 - could be
38:04 - this could be actually a good one and
38:06 - then it's good projects to put on your
38:08 - resume as well
38:10 - machine learning using css what the [ __ ]
38:14 - [Laughter]

40:58 - daily or as close to daily as possible
41:00 - let us know drop it in the comments oh
41:03 - yeah like
41:05 - just some having fun sessions yeah
41:08 - just coding up some stuff yeah and then
41:11 - i mean yeah there are going to be a lot
41:12 - of times we're going to be a lot more
41:13 - intense where we're going to be coding
41:14 - up
41:15 - full on projects from scratch so we
41:18 - already have some projects in the
41:20 - pipelines like uh
41:21 - we have a crazy airbnb project that i
41:23 - was already showing so we're gonna
41:25 - we're gonna build that and then also
41:27 - build amazon from the ground up
41:29 - but using redux yeah everybody's
41:32 - dropping yes daily yes yes
41:35 - did it with search kit okay bang
41:39 - like when you say search kit you mean
41:40 - like um
41:42 - oh you use this thing okay cool there's
41:44 - something called uh
41:45 - reactive something too look at that
41:48 - it's called a reactive
41:53 - search yeah this one so check this one
41:57 - out too
41:57 - because this one is really good as well
41:59 - but i mean hold on
42:01 - search mate bro you're not sharing your
42:04 - screen by the way oh my bad my bad my
42:06 - bad my bad
42:07 - so there's uh this which you guys can
42:10 - wow
42:10 - check out reactive search and it's like
42:13 - point and click and it gives you ui
42:16 - from point and click gives you a full on
42:18 - ui but it's like
42:20 - fast as [ __ ] ui it's full
42:23 - react ui as well um
42:27 - so that's what i love about that one and
42:29 - then this is the one that he recommended
42:31 - search kit so let's see
42:40 - out of the box components okay cool oh
42:42 - so it seems like you use the
42:44 - an out of the box component for it dope
42:47 - oh okay their github is popping too
42:51 - nice so yeah they're both going to be
42:53 - really good so you can try out
42:55 - either either one i like reactive search
42:57 - because
42:59 - i don't want to sit down and write
43:01 - elastic search
43:02 - code um so
43:06 - by pointing and clicking and making and
43:08 - it's super super helpful
43:11 - guys kazi is the laziest co-editor ever
43:14 - yeah and outside of that for search you
43:16 - guys should really look into using
43:18 - algolia
43:19 - this is fast as hell and it's just so
43:22 - powerful

Cleaned transcript:

how's it going this is your boy qazi from cleverprogrammer.com i really hope that you guys are excited because we're going to be doing a lot of brainstorming and coming up with ideas together today and learning some react.js today i have the privilege to be here with what's up everybody this is uh this is david from cover programmer and i had some echo going on but i'm super excited to get the get on this journey so let's go let's go is your echo good now yep yeah yeah awesome so super super sick i'm excited to be doing these again with you guys and we're going to be doing a lot more of these and get back in the flow but what i want to talk to you guys about is a few things so few important things so one let me actually go like this right so a few important things one is we want to come up with some amazing ideas to actually build uh react projects on and what you guys are trying to learn because there's a lot of things that we want to teach but we want to make sure these are things that you want to learn so for example we're thinking about technologies like next js do you want to see projects with next do you want to see projects with gatsby do you want to see do you want to see us talk about server side or clientside rendering do you want to see us talk more about firebase and authentication there are a lot of ways we can go but it's important that we get your feedback on it what do you think about that david yes 100 i think we are 100 uh about for you guys and we work for you so we would really really appreciate whatever feedback you guys have and just deliver on the content that you think would be valuable for you yeah so whatever is up let's get it yeah so one thing i want to do is i actually want to go on to youtube and see also like be able to connect with the live stream and see what's going on because i forgot to open that up normally i open that up right away so we'll have that up and running just so we can see everybody that's in here welcome welcome everybody so freaking nice to have you guys here and it's really nice to be able to do this again yo what's up akash yo lucas what's going on abhishek says server side rendering abhishek says apis okay server side rendering good morning all right it seems like a lot of people are interested in node okay nice yeah yeah go i'm going sorry yeah i was just gonna say that it seems like a lot of people are actually interested in learning about um learning about server side yes yeah yeah i saw a few nodes node.js's and i also saw react with typescript so that's good yeah okay let me see am i all right when i go on this yep my screen is looking beautiful okay so maybe some laps so okay what we're gonna do is we're gonna you guys are gonna code along with us or just watch us code and make some stuff and then as we do that keep typing your ideas uh in here and if you could actually type in as a youtube comment that would be really phenomenal because um then the top voted comments we can just easily see what you guys are looking for or david we can make like a little form and they can submit their whatever i think even easier is to put our instagram handle on the screen and then just have people vms how about that that's not that becomes like then we have to go through all of them i want it in a way where we can easily see you know what i mean like what ideas they like the best we have some people saying um node and apis yeah we have more node jwt and aws lamba lambda nice okay okay let's uh we got a ton of django projects okay okay or we have one person who's telling who's like kind of django projects so let's just let's just while we sit here and chat let's build something and work on this together with them so like people can learn some skills as well and just have fun so one of the things i see a lot that happen in interviews and even a lot of the interviews i'm conducting is i'm checking for your skills obviously with like algorithms i'm also checking your skills and how you deal with apis api is like one of the common things interviewers are going to check you on and it's also one of the most important parts of your job so yes 100 it's probably good that you should know about them and are comfortable with them yeah so yeah like apis are so powerful like you don't have to code up all those kind of stuff you just like api and that's that's it works right so let's uh create react app and let's create a react app here so i'm going to remove this file because react at will complain if you have a file let's try it now okay cool so it should be working and then let's open up chrome bring that also i just made a super quick form on to so that you guys can actually submit so i will drop it in the chat right now so bang just guys go ahead uh check out that link i'll drop it like two or three times in there so you guys can actually see it and just drop whatever technology or something you guys are interested in and then we can like see it okay oh that's smart that's really really smart awesome let me actually click on that so we can show it to people yeah that's a really good way yeah exactly that's so simple i love it so guys yeah just go here to this form uh the url is right there i mean hopefully it's in the youtube description or in the comments add it to the youtube description if you could please okay and just drop in like what are you interested in right so it's like next js is it typescript is it um you know it's you want to see airbnb clone um whatsapp clone you know uh what discord clone a lot of them we've already done tesla clone um so it's it's not just clones but it's also like what types of projects do you want to see what type of tech stack do you want to see do you want to see payment authentication in there do you want to see stripe do you want to see you know different types of back ends like mongodb versus what what else like some people yeah firebase just a comparison of all the databases right awesome so that's right there for you guys check it out whenever you want david i was going to tell you actually one thing that's super cool that i found is called uh json placeholder.typeycode do you know about this not really so um what's super cool about this website is you can go and get fake apis that you can like request right away bang yes that's good so for teaching people this is really really helpful so for example if we want people to get more comfortable with apis and how they work let's say i want to get this post i want to get all of the posts right so let's say that i'm here on this and it has a bunch of posts it seems like it has a hundred posts on here right so if i want to be able to get all of these hundred posts let's go inside of our app.js and uh what we'll do is i'll do yarn start so we'll whip this app up real quick and i want you guys to get a lot of practice with these things because the more practice you get the better you're gonna become at it exactly it's all about the reps cool so we got this and if i make it smaller david is it still easy for you to be able to see my screen uh quickly check can you guys still read my code easily yeah i think it's good okay awesome so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go ahead and you know when i'm reading data from an api request there are simple ways to do it and one of the ways is really easy to just write fetch and then call your whatever you have uh so let's let me get my url this one right there yeah so that's the first thing i want to do and then i can just do that then and chain it with things okay exactly so here let's see i think that's one of the things they also that's the thing that i always like i have a code where i have all these fat stuff yeah and i always just copy paste that thing i can't remember this let me go like this inspect and let's see what we get back so right now we're getting you might want to move us from the corner of the screen because it literally covers oh my bad yeah boom oh yeah there we go and just zoom in a bit onto my code or what oh oh in the in the comments on the on the console yeah cool boom that's lit all right dang so what what what did we get back here we got some promised state from this but if i actually want to get data from it in real time i think you need to return it i need to return it but also one thing i want to show here for everybody here is because it's a promise you don't want to call it after you you know you get the data back from it because you're not getting the data back you get the promise back and you print it out so where you actually want to add your console log statement is right here oh yeah yeah and we're gonna remove the initial console log statement because we don't we don't need that anymore so here's our fetch request and let's see what we get back what is it giving me cool so we have we have a lot of our results in here like every single thing that we wanted we're getting that back right you see that zero we got post one we got post two so all the posts that we actually need we're able to get back and another thing if you guys are having trouble coming up with this this place can also be a good place for you to go to to just get that initial thing so boom right like yeah type that right so if you can't remember you can go here and get that like initial request so i'm just gonna do post still because i don't want to do the todo's and let's see what it uh gets us back let's hit refresh boom so i got an array with 100 items and what are those items all those i think user yeah yep we have user and then uh we have a post from each person so 100 posts bang yeah and sick how many users do we have actually if you actually look we have i only see ones and twos so user id if you see user ids they actually go from one to ten so there are a hundred basically what this is telling us there's a hundred posts made by ten users you see what i'm saying david yeah yeah oh i need to crank up the resolution resolution how is my screen uh i don't know uh i was watching in a youtube and i was just uh at 480p uhhuh but now it's now it's good okay now now i see everything try to watch it from ecam instead of zoom because or i'm sorry because instead of youtube because you're not going to see it in real time oh that's right you'll be like 40 seconds behind everything all right so i want to ask everybody who's here live who feels comfortable being able to fetch data from an api if you don't feel comfortable you should work you should practice it okay i highly recommend that and somebody's saying something really smart abishik says qazi i think you should use use effect because that's what's happening when the page first loads up so good so whenever you guys are doing these types of api requests it's a good idea to use usefx so it only fires off once so david is writing the import statement for is it use effect that's correct cool yeah and then what we'll do is we'll take we'll make a use effect and i'm just gonna close it here and we'll give it a second argument of empty give it an empty dependency yeah but you need to rub yes well i thought it was like a one line implicit return type of action going on but all good cool that's why that's why you should use es7 snippets boom so there we go now it's looking good we have it firing off it only fires off once because of use effect and it's showing up okay so we have all of the 100 posts now if we wanted to we could take the post and we could show it off on the screen so where do you want to go from here david do you want to take these posts and start showing them on the screen i think we could do that yeah in some sort of a table way or i just want to i just want to show it like almost like an interview okay so imagine i'm interviewing you so let's just do like a live interview between you and me okay ouch so let's say that i want you to i want you to just um show me the title of each post and just like throw it on the screen i i don't care about styling or anything i just want you to like splat the title on the screen okay so what i will definitely do is i will create a use state over here on the top because i want to save it somewhere obviously so use state first i need to import it if i learn how to type and now i will just say const and how should i call it um maybe data yeah yeah yeah i'll call it data and then i'll have a set data by the way somebody somebody wrote a pretty awesome comment that said um whoa hold on hold on somebody donated your first donation yeah so we got our first donation thank you so much for that thank you so much really appreciate it and here's a really cool comment so by vocal and vocal says i just started learning react two days ago i'm a larval developer and i went to a job interview and i was asked to write react code i was stunned anyways i decided to start learning react yes let's go i'm so happy that you started learning react okay great that happens a lot guys people are gonna ask you to see your skills so many people are gonna come to you in interviews and ask to see your skills that have you code from scratch so really important exactly you're able to do that and yeah jump on in you're in the right place so keep going david so you got your you got your um using hooks here yes i just declared this hook over here and what i will do is i will add uh the set data over here so i'll just make it a twoliner thing yeah like that and what i will do like after i console logged it i will set the data to j uh and i will throw in json so if i see the correct data happening in the console i will have the correct data in uh in the data hook yeah so as soon as we see this data it seems like you're um you're storing it in data right that's correct exactly that's correct got it okay and next up what i will do is i'll actually get rid of oh no i'll make a line uh after this link in the learn react one and i will just add a p tag hold on no uh before i do that i will because i'm using jsx uh i will start typing in javascript inside of this why don't you remove the entire um react logo and everything do you want to do that or no uh you could leave it if i actually want i actually want to keep the logo but everything else can go okay cool i like the logo me too me too i like the way it looks yeah and i'll just type in data map and can you please open up the console so i can see exactly what are the um fields in there uh okay cool you have access to my local host but okay got it oh yeah all right so there these are the fields this is what it looks like okay so because i say data.map i will get back some sort of item and i want to start working with that item and because you asked only for the title i will just add the p tag now the p that comes and i will just throw in uh the item dot title i think let's try that out oh [ __ ] bang all right nice well let's give it up for am i hired hold on hey nice okay so you're not hired you're not gonna be hired yet i still have i still will have more questions for you as we keep going along today and i don't get it but what i but what i would say is okay nice job so it seems like you're taking the titles of each post and you're printing it out now what i would like to see is something like this okay so um can i see all of these posts like so so for example i want to see it's a post uh one like that and then post two and post three and so on you see what i'm saying so it should say all the way up to post 100 like that okay um so because we have an id in there which actually indicates uh the number of the post i will use that and what i will do is inside of the p tag i will actually just for styling's sake i will add a strong tag and that was a post and then i'll just throw in the item dot id i think yes and a colon and yeah there you go okay good nice i'm getting all of them give me the emoji you know i like my finger pointing emoji forget about that colon it's too professional for us so okay what kind of image do you want rocket no no no the finger pointing the pointing the finger to the right the one i had okay nice rocket point right yeah that's the one let's see it nice okay clean there we go awesome so we have we have all the titles going on right we have all the titles going on so this is something that in interviews they'll commonly ask you to be able to do guys you would be so surprised how many people fail at this like you will be so surprised how many developers who are working with react apparently for a year and have been doing more or more and went to a boot camp and paid 15 000 can't do something like this like they'll see this and that's like they'll crumble under the pressure or whatever it is but like they won't be able to do something like this now regardless of whether it's because you're scared or because you lack the skill to be able to do this both of them are just as bad so you're gonna need to get used to it and get used to that skill of being able to do it under pressure yeah marla gaming says this is basic isn't it i mean it pretty much is but the reality is that we've interviewed so many people and literally people were failing at this yes so yeah that's it yeah go ahead yeah yeah and just wanted to throw in a an advice to anybody who who actually feel feels like this could be challenging at this point like you saw what i did i was commenting on what i was doing and that actually bought me a little bit of time to think over what i will be doing next and that also gives the interviewer a view of what is going on inside of your head and if if you're going the wrong direction they might might help you because why not yeah that's that's that's pretty important what you just said because if you don't talk out loud it hurts you more than it helps you because exactly i'm gonna be on your side as an interviewer as long as i can hear your thought process i will help you out and you know go along the way because if you're let's say that you know that you have to sum an array right exactly yeah and let's say that you don't remember what the function is called in javascript because in python it's just the function is called sum but in javascript it's like math.sum yeah so if you don't i don't know yeah are you asking no i'm telling you that's what it's called the javascript is called math.sum that's the function for summing an array right right you just do mat that sum and you call it an array you following me so far yeah yeah well what i'm saying is let's just say that like you um you've you forgot what the term for it was now if you're quiet and you're not talking out loud i have no idea what you're looking for so as an interviewer i can't really help you with anything but if you were talking out loud and you're like okay so at this point i need to sum an array and oh man i can't remember the function to sum an array in javascript if you say that out loud now i might just actually tell you oh yeah the syntax for it is math.sum with javascript to do it yeah so or they might just tell you like bro use google and that's something that you wouldn't think of during an interview i guess yeah that's something let me see what we got yeah buddy guys this is gonna be exciting because we're gonna start doing a lot more lives and another thing i wanted to tell you is we're also gonna be doing a challenge for react js this month and this challenge is going to be really really crazy and in the upcoming days we're going to be building some big projects too so like for example uh if you guys have ever wanted to see the amazon clone with redux implemented you're going to be able to see that if you wanted to see airbnb with redux you're going to be able to see that so we're going to be working on some really epic projects along the upcoming days and today we wanted to engage with you and start getting your feedback on like what type of content you're looking for and what you're interested in as well and that's why we created a forum uh where you guys can go and actually type in what it is that you are interested in looking for so here's the form all right that's the url go there type in and let us know what it is what are the things that you're excited about what type of technology you're excited about the more of these we get that's the type of stuff we're gonna make content on so you're gonna you wanna see some banger ass content pop it in here we're gonna make it because you know we deliver all right exactly we already have 20 submissions so that's amazing wow keep it going keep it going this is awesome jonathan says just wanted to say um let me read it here so you guys can see my face he says uh oh let's bring this here too you want to say i found your channel i'm almost done with build slack clone video i managed to follow along and customize that myself learn so much thank you for your efforts beautiful day that's what's up hey that's awesome let's go hey amanita is here let's go let's go modest hey um marlega says is redux overkill for hobby projects i would say yes for 100 for squad hold on i would also say that oh sorry okay okay okay okay so i would say if you're building just for the sake of building stuff and to have fun and to learn redux i would say it's an amazing stuff and to just put it onto portfolio and then you can show that okay i can work with redux that is a really that's a really good point so if you want to add it to your portfolio and you want to learn it so that you could do it for a company later yes absolutely learn it but if you're doing it for a freelance project or a hobby project and you're not doing it for a purpose of learning you're using it for a purpose of building something that's not necessary at all i would highly recommend to not work and use redux because dan abramoff the creator of redux wrote five to ten pieces of articles on like why you should not use redux when to use redux when to not use redux read those what you're gonna find out is that it's really good for mediumsized to largesized applications the boilerplate for simple projects is not that helpful ben ayowa who's another youtuber he made a video called why no longer use redux and in that video he actually talked about that instead of redux and redux saga and redux forms he changed his stack completely what he switched to is he switched to formic formik for forms it's supposed to make your tears go away and all the frustration that comes around forms and he switched from redux to unstated which is a state management library but it makes managing states so easy that you don't even see that you're managing state it literally feels like you're just using hooks and it allows you to manage a global state of your application so maybe for your hobby projects a good stack for you can be formic and unstated um this is a recommendation from ben a watt so wow i didn't even know about these it's amazing yeah so let's see where your projects are the easier you can go back to it later hold on let me um take this thing and move it over real quick so i can show everybody all right so here's so formic build react build forms and react without the so this is so formic is going to make your forms really easy and then you got all the code right here for the form and super super simple looking form i mean this is probably the easiest form you'll ever see and then wait what do they actually have uh do they have uh form validation by the time kaz is searching on the page just quick question drop it in the chat please if you guys are interested in building some sort of project with this because i actually got hyped with formic yeah oh yeah 4mx is sick all right so this is really good now the other thing is unstated okay so let's go here they have our actual website front stated let's click here all right so here's unstated states so simple it goes without saying okay it's so simple they didn't even build a website for it yeah so um what they say is this okay is this better than is unstated better than redux by the way um david clip this part out what i'm about to say right now because this could be a great video with this title okay sounds good okay is unstated better than redux uh it's smaller 40 times smaller it's faster componentize the problem performance it's easier to learn you already will have uh to know react hooks in context just use them to rock it's easier to integrate integrate one component at a time and easily integrate with every react library it's easier to test it's easier to type check its minimal is just react this is how you install it and you guys can see that the usage of it looks simple and uh you know here you're making a container which is kind of like a you know it sounds like a redux store and uh you got your initial state and you're using hooks instead of using stores and reducers and middleware and utilities and all of that so much much much simpler at least in my opinion dang that's so cool yeah so if you want to use it for yourself i think it's a really good idea 100 like definitely have redux on your portfolio if you know it yeah but like for hobby projects forget about that hey yeah for sure let's see what people are saying uhhuh someone wants to build an operating system react hook forms for the when julio says let's see react hook arms performant and excellent easy to validate oh [ __ ] they're like 17 000 uh stars that's dope take a look at four make two and see if you still like these better if you still like these better then definitely go with them go with this that looks pretty dope too yeah they're fun i like their front end that they did for this they did a great job yeah oh [ __ ] look at that look at that touched feels will display here touched oh [ __ ] if i touch mobile number they'll show me dang damn that's pretty cool hosted on versal and versailles is amazing for hosting i'm like such a such a huge fan performance is an important aspect of using terms of building you will have the ability to subscribe to individual input changes without rerendering the entire form watching damn for marketing that's really really good okay this is a really good find thank you for that i appreciate that uh bishal says i use formic yup for form validation hey let's go got some people in here who know what they're talking about that's what's up let's go uhhuh nice i'm a complete beginner by the way still struggling don't worry like literally join these sessions and just make a habit yes of yourself coding every single day two hours i know you have two hours like screw watching movies and netflix yeah spend some time coding every single
