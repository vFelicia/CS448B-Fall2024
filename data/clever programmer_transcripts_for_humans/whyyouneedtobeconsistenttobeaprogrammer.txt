00:31 - into it
00:33 - [Music]
00:43 - the main thing I want to talk about
00:45 - today is consistency right now this is a
00:48 - topic that a lot of people don't find it
00:50 - sexy and you don't always want to talk
00:52 - about it because it's not your
00:54 - get-rich-quick or get something done in
00:57 - a very short amount of time kind of
00:59 - thing right it takes a second to to
01:03 - actually implement this in your life
01:04 - because you have to be consistent
01:06 - because a lot of the times what happens
01:07 - is let's say as programmers right as
01:09 - people who are trying to learn how to
01:10 - code whether it's Python PHP Java
01:13 - whatever it is trying you're trying to
01:15 - learn web development or even if some
01:18 - you're doing something out of
01:19 - programming what it takes is incremental
01:22 - effort to get better at it right a lot
01:25 - of the times what happens with me is
01:27 - sometimes when I want to learn something
01:29 - new I see one of my friends do it and
01:32 - they're really good at it right I'm like
01:34 - holy like this person is really
01:36 - good at it right then what happens to me
01:38 - is I want to get there immediately and
01:41 - if I don't get there immediately
01:43 - I will feel discouraged disappointed and
01:46 - I'll kind of identified entity myself
01:49 - with that but it's important to
01:51 - understand that you know that that
01:54 - person it took them a long time of
01:56 - consistent effort consistent small
01:59 - failures yeah yeah we can we can have
02:00 - that thank you so much you know it just
02:03 - takes a long time oh that looks
02:06 - delicious
02:07 - thank you how good does that look
02:10 - yeah so we're gonna eat in a second my
02:16 - good friend clucks you most of is
02:18 - recording this for me you guys should
02:20 - check out some of his photography on his
02:22 - Instagram well link it in the
02:23 - description below but let's not get
02:26 - sidetracked so you know we feel like we
02:30 - have to get there immediately and if we
02:32 - don't get there immediately like we get
02:34 - kind of upset about it right or do get
02:36 - disappointed and then what happens it
02:38 - kills your journey so let's say you want
02:41 - to learn how to play pool right like the
02:43 - snooker or pool and you see your friend
02:45 - play really well now you get smoked by
02:47 - and blown out of the water and you just
02:49 - get really frustrated
02:51 - what can you do to improve yourself well
02:53 - start by slowly you know working on your
02:57 - strokes start by slowly like working on
03:00 - potting a few balls right and enjoy that
03:05 - process make small goals and enjoy that
03:08 - process and be consistent with it
03:10 - same thing with computer programming
03:11 - let's say you're getting frustrated with
03:13 - it and it's hurting your brain and
03:15 - you're like I can't do this
03:17 - this is too difficult so what happens
03:20 - you stop enjoying the process and then
03:22 - after that every second of it feels like
03:24 - work and then that leads to you quitting
03:27 - so for you to be consistent you have to
03:30 - associate that with something that's fun
03:33 - right and then after that what you want
03:36 - to do is just make small consistent
03:38 - effort ok day in and day out Brett you
03:41 - know I can tell you sometimes it doesn't
03:42 - feel like fun sometimes it just feels
03:45 - like crap right you just won't feel good
03:47 - you'll be coding you'll be trying to UM
03:50 - you know like get through a specific
03:53 - problem work on a specific project or
03:55 - just get through a tutorial and it'll
03:57 - just feel like painful grind pulling
04:00 - your teeth but you gotta get through it
04:02 - okay so certain times what you want to
04:04 - do is just okay I want to spend one hour
04:07 - every day to work on this skill whether
04:10 - it's fun or not so you want to try to
04:12 - make it as fun as possible but if you

04:26 - know a really good win one day and
04:29 - you'll just have success and everything
04:30 - will be making sense you in programming
04:32 - it'll be smoking this project and
04:34 - working really well at on it right well
04:36 - there's a Python app you're developing
04:37 - or or whatever and then the next day you
04:40 - just feel like you're stuck in this
04:41 - problem can't get through it spend six
04:43 - hours and haven't improved at all and
04:45 - you just feel like Plateau right and you
