00:01 - nice um
00:03 - so with that said we're going to go
00:04 - ahead and style
00:06 - the video card so what we did initially
00:10 - was we said
00:11 - that the the video is too big right it's
00:13 - just way too big so i'm going to go
00:14 - ahead and give the video player
00:16 - so if i go ahead and do video on sponsor
00:18 - player
00:20 - what i'm going to first do is go ahead
00:21 - and give it a height and width of a
00:22 - hundred percent
00:24 - right so if i go and do that you see now
00:25 - the videos fits perfectly inside right
00:28 - so it fits perfectly inside of that and
00:30 - what i'm going to now do is also
00:32 - is because if you scroll through it now
00:36 - you'll notice that it's the snapping
00:38 - doesn't work
00:40 - yep it doesn't work right now yeah so it
00:42 - doesn't work right
00:44 - so we kind of had oh so firstly actually
00:46 - a good there's a good point now so i
00:47 - need to add the video card twice so let
00:49 - me add two video cards or three
00:50 - so we can actually visually see if there
00:52 - are two or three in there so i'm going
00:53 - to go ahead and add three
00:55 - so now you can see if i even wait it
00:57 - doesn't
00:58 - ever snap so it doesn't snap right
01:02 - so we set the parents or app videos we
01:04 - set the
01:05 - the scroll snapping behavior there but
01:07 - we need to set it to the child
01:08 - so now inside a video card we gave it
01:11 - video
01:12 - player right so inside of videocard.css
01:14 - what i'm going to do now is go over and
01:16 - target the parent container so video
01:18 - and i need to add the following lines i
01:20 - need to say give it a heightened width
01:22 - of 100 pixels
01:23 - and give it the scroll snap align
01:27 - start property right so these are
01:30 - crucial in order to get that work right
01:32 - so what this is saying is it will take
01:34 - up 100
01:35 - width this is huge i'm sorry to just
01:36 - keep interrupting but this is too good
01:38 - to not
01:39 - share bob's craig
01:42 - says let me uh he goes join profit with
01:45 - javascript it was the best decision of
01:48 - my life you're the best channel on
01:49 - youtube clever programmer
01:51 - and you have helped me so much on my
01:53 - self-taught journey
01:55 - bro that's amazing right that is
01:58 - freaking crazy
01:59 - welcome to the community hopefully you
02:01 - even had a call with sunny
02:03 - but yeah yes thanks so much for just
02:05 - your vote of confidence and being a part
02:08 - of this community bob
02:09 - we love you appreciate you and thank you
02:11 - for saying that
02:13 - exactly and like honestly like i want to
02:15 - speak to each and every single one of
02:17 - you guys if i haven't already so
02:19 - we do the coaching calls i do my
02:21 - coaching call every tuesday so make sure
02:22 - you're there
02:23 - and i would love to chat to you uh in
02:25 - person on that zoom call so that'll be
02:27 - amazing yeah
02:28 - thank you dude um it's pretty nice so we
02:30 - just added that code
02:32 - which said that we would add a width of
02:34 - a height of 100
02:36 - and scroll snap a line start right so
02:39 - now what we're going to do is because if
02:40 - you go ahead and scroll
02:42 - let's see if it's if it snaps
02:46 - it doesn't snap right now should it
02:51 - okay i just saved it anyways and i'm
02:52 - going to refresh and i'll try again
02:56 - not snapping right now no so we need to
02:59 - actually give it a position
03:00 - of relative right and this will make it
03:02 - relative to its parent
03:04 - container so if we do that we should see
03:07 - some snapping behavior
03:09 - so let's go ahead and try oh oops okay
03:12 - this threw me off this drew me up big
03:14 - time
03:14 - okay so it's because we actually changed
03:17 - the class names of video
03:18 - to video card right so inside a video
03:21 - card i need to actually go and do video
03:22 - card
03:24 - video oh man that's why yeah that's what
03:27 - i do
03:27 - [Music]
03:29 - okay nice awesome
03:32 - so if we go ahead and do that and then
03:34 - what we need to do also for video player
03:36 - i want to add you see it crops a little
03:37 - bit i want to make your object
03:39 - fit fill and what that does is it
03:41 - actually goes and fills the container
03:42 - all right
03:43 - so let's go ahead and scroll now
03:49 - yep there we go
03:54 - hold on let's see yep now it's snapping
03:58 - awesome so you see we get that snapping
04:00 - behavior guys yeah
04:01 - that was fast yeah it's crazy right like
04:05 - this is such a neat little trick that i
04:07 - will always and guys this is what i want
04:09 - you to learn
04:09 - when you figure this out like a snapping
04:11 - sort of tutorial or you find something
04:13 - good
04:14 - hold on to that because that will help
04:16 - you in
04:17 - so many situations like if i had known
04:19 - this it would have made my life
04:21 - so much easier and so many other jobs i
04:23 - had worked on so
04:24 - take like add this to your portfolio and
04:26 - then have also have it as a reference to
04:28 - go back to you in the future when you're
04:30 - stuck on things and that sort of stuff
04:31 - because
04:32 - it will save you a bunch of time in your
04:33 - in your work
04:35 - i'm also going to add a border one pixel
04:37 - solid black to the card
04:39 - so that it's very apparent when we
04:40 - scroll through that there's a little
04:42 - border around it
04:43 - so that should help out a bit more in
04:45 - terms of
04:46 - visually seeing what's going on okay but
04:48 - with that said the styling is done
04:50 - okay for that uh what i'm going to go
04:52 - ahead and do is go back to the video
04:54 - card
04:55 - and
