With timestamps:

00:00 - in this video we're gonna be building
00:02 - the ubereats wet 3 Clone with nexjs
00:05 - we're gonna be using infuro to connect
00:07 - it to the ethereum blockchain now we are
00:09 - going to be creating a bunch of nfts
00:11 - that will give you discounts in this app
00:13 - and we will be able to check whether the
00:15 - user has it or doesn't and then
00:17 - calculate the subtotal we're also going
00:20 - to have a bunch of goodies in this app
00:22 - so with that said let's go ahead and get
00:24 - started okay so as usual we're going to
00:26 - be using the clever programmer custom
00:29 - CLI tool that we built for you so just
00:31 - make sure you are on the latest version
00:33 - and let's go ahead and just type in npx
00:36 - lover programmer pop in your email then
00:39 - your name and then we're gonna be
00:40 - selecting the solidity Uber Eats option
00:43 - and while that takes a while it'll also
00:46 - open up
00:47 - infuri for you so just make sure you
00:49 - have an account if you don't have one
00:50 - already and create a new
00:54 - new project but in the mean what
00:56 - meantime the terminal is apparently done
00:58 - and it opened up vs code so that's nice
01:02 - so let's just check out how the app
01:03 - looks like
01:05 - or don't
01:06 - and let's just go ahead create a new API
01:09 - key on inferior so we're going to be
01:11 - selecting the web3 API that is their
01:13 - combined all the chains that you will
01:16 - ever need a type of API so just name it
01:19 - whatever ubereats but just make sure you
01:22 - don't have space in between them because
01:24 - later on when you try to connect it to
01:26 - your vs code it is better not to have
01:29 - space in the project now it'll take a
01:32 - little bit to load and then this is what
01:34 - you're gonna see if you select endpoints
01:36 - that's all your RPC URLs that you will
01:39 - need all right let's go back to our code
01:42 - vs code and let's actually connect it to
01:45 - our vs code so if you don't have truffle
01:49 - already installed into your vs code now
01:52 - is the time to go ahead and do it it's a
01:54 - free extension it's just where every
01:56 - other extension is and just make sure
01:58 - you disconnect all the networks and then
02:00 - you just reconnect so you're starting
02:02 - this session with a fresh connection
02:05 - so go ahead straight away just connect
02:08 - to your infuria and uberes will pop up
02:10 - immediately and there you go that is
02:13 - everything you will need for this one
02:15 - now straight away let's go into our Uber
02:18 - Eats discount
02:19 - nft.sol file that is created by the CLI
02:23 - tool so let's go ahead and get started
02:26 - with that too let's set out the nft
02:28 - collection so we're going to be using
02:30 - solidity version zero eight zero so just
02:33 - make sure you specify that version
02:35 - and then we're going to be importing a
02:37 - couple of things from open Zeppelin so
02:40 - this is going to be an ERC 1155
02:42 - compliant token so let's import that and
02:45 - also you want to make sure that whenever
02:47 - you're importing in previous builds we
02:49 - already have these issues when you're
02:51 - importing
02:52 - you want to import from open sapling
02:54 - contracts not just contract okay and
02:57 - we're going to be importing ownable
02:59 - because these nfts will have someone who
03:02 - owns them
03:03 - and let's actually create the ubereats
03:07 - discount nft that is an ownable ERC 1155
03:11 - token so this is going to be a child to
03:14 - those now we're going to create a string
03:16 - that's going to be a public string and
03:18 - that will be the token URI and we're
03:22 - also going to go ahead create a
03:23 - Constructor this is actually like
03:25 - standard and ft procedures so you need a
03:28 - token URI you're gonna need the
03:30 - Constructor because that's how you
03:32 - whenever you're minting that's what's
03:34 - gonna run Constructor string memory
03:36 - token URI and then it's going to be ERC
03:39 - 1155 and then we're gonna have a mint
03:42 - function passing in the account the
03:44 - amount and this is going to be a payable
03:47 - minting function meaning the user has to
03:51 - pay for these nfts to be minted so we're
03:53 - gonna make sure that the user at least
03:55 - sends 0.01 ether otherwise we're gonna
04:00 - have to reject this minting and we're
04:03 - gonna be minting the nfts into his or
04:06 - her account
04:08 - and we're also going to be passing in a
04:10 - couple of other attributes alongside
04:12 - with the amount so with that said that
04:15 - is your Uber Eats discount nft let's go
04:18 - ahead and move on to the next step
04:22 - all right so let's actually set up a
04:24 - couple of things for this nft
04:26 - so first off we're going to be going
04:28 - ahead and opening up our Chrome
04:30 - and we're going to be creating a ipfs
04:33 - API key the reason is when you have an
04:36 - nft you will have to sort the image
04:38 - somewhere and that's usually going on
04:40 - ipfs now
04:41 - again just don't leave any spaces in the
04:44 - project name so there you have it and
04:47 - now what we're going to be doing is
04:48 - we're going to be enabling dedicated
04:50 - gateways because that's something
04:52 - inferior can do and it's super cool so
04:54 - just pop in knit your name clever
04:56 - programmer whatever you really want to
05:00 - but what this will enable you to do is
05:03 - that it will create a sub domain under
05:05 - infuro's ipfs and that is going to be
05:08 - your own dedicated Gateway
05:11 - so once you save it
05:13 - you can go back to your vs code
05:16 - and we're going to be opening a terminal
05:20 - but you want to also make sure that you
05:23 - open it under the data folder so by
05:26 - default vs code only opens it under
05:28 - ubereats infuro so basically the project
05:31 - and then you can either CD into so just
05:35 - say CD data or just open it in the data
05:39 - folder directly
05:41 - so in there's this nice little
05:42 - Lamborghini image and the nft Json so
05:45 - the nft Json is going to contain all
05:49 - your NFC metadata and this is what we'll
05:50 - be using later so let's just rename it
05:53 - so it will be Uber Eats subscription
05:55 - description again a subscription for
05:58 - ubereats whatever you can that doesn't
06:01 - really matter but that's what you're
06:02 - going to show on show up on openc
06:04 - and you can also pop in your uh sub
06:07 - domain so basically what we're going to
06:09 - be doing is inside the terminal we're
06:11 - going to say inferior auth this is going
06:13 - to be creating a variable equals and
06:15 - then just the project ID column API
06:18 - Secret
06:20 - so that's exactly what's happening I
06:23 - will just save it into your terminal
06:24 - session and then you can invoke it later
06:26 - so you don't have to always copy paste
06:28 - these and then we're going to say curlex
06:30 - post so basically an API call to using
06:33 - the inferior auth indication to this
06:36 - ipfs that impure is providing pure uh
06:39 - ipf is the same dot impure.io column 501
06:43 - API v0 add
06:46 - and then we're going to be attaching the
06:48 - file so we're going to say that Lambo
06:51 - nft and the reason why and this is where
06:53 - it becomes important that you are in the
06:55 - correct folder
06:57 - with your terminal otherwise the lambo
06:59 - nft will obviously not be found so what
07:03 - this gun is going to do is this will
07:05 - just upload the image to the ipfs now
07:08 - we're gonna have to because ipfs cleared
07:11 - itself and if you pin it it won't clear
07:13 - that particular file
07:16 - so now what we're going to say is going
07:18 - to be another a post call but to slash
07:21 - API v0 pin slash add and in the
07:25 - arguments we're going to be popping in
07:27 - the ipfs we're going to say slash ipfs
07:30 - slash and whatever comes back as your
07:32 - hash as a response from the previous
07:34 - requests just paste that there and that
07:37 - should be good to go once again this
07:39 - hash goes right here if it wasn't clear
07:42 - and then you will see your pins that is
07:46 - supposed to be the same hash that just
07:49 - came back or that you just pinned so
07:52 - now you can go ahead and put that at the
07:55 - end of the link and you will also want
07:58 - to make sure that you are copying your
08:01 - dedicated Gateway because that's the
08:04 - reason why we have it just paste it
08:06 - there and that will be your URL for the
08:10 - image so nice that works perfectly
08:13 - now we're gonna repeat this exact same
08:17 - process but instead of the image we're
08:20 - going to be uploading and then pinning
08:22 - the nft Json file so I'm just going to
08:25 - go through this fast so we're going to
08:27 - say so instead of file Lambo and nft
08:29 - whereas a nft the Json the reason is
08:32 - for now we only uploaded the image but
08:35 - we haven't uploaded the metadata so now
08:37 - we created the metadata file but we have
08:39 - to upload and pin that and that's what's
08:42 - going to be used by the nft okay we
08:45 - uploaded it now let's go ahead and pin
08:47 - that guy okay there seems to be some
08:50 - sort of error
08:51 - oh and that is because there was a typo
08:53 - so if you type ifura instead of infuria
08:57 - that's obviously not going to work
09:00 - okay and now there you go it is working
09:02 - perfectly
09:04 - and
09:06 - now we're gonna create the pins XD file
09:09 - and we're just gonna paste the two we're
09:12 - just gonna paste the metadata
09:14 - location so that whenever we are
09:17 - creating the NFC we'll be pasting this
09:21 - link in there so that should be good to
09:23 - go let's move on to the next part
09:26 - oh all right so let's now start
09:30 - converting the US dollar values into Wei
09:33 - and ether
09:34 - the currency of the blockchain
09:37 - so if you're going to cart.jsx on 944
09:40 - there is a const USD to way function
09:44 - it's going to be super simple super
09:46 - quick basically you're just gonna say
09:48 - const E equals USD USD to eth and on
09:53 - line 36 as you can see it's already
09:56 - defined what that is so you can just
09:59 - change that it's not the scope of this
10:01 - project to include the live updating so
10:03 - just move on
10:05 - now we're going to be converting it to
10:07 - way and that's going to be
10:10 - using the ethers Library so we're going
10:12 - to say
10:14 - ethers.utls.parse ether and then just
10:16 - pass in the eth.to string or the eighth
10:20 - value as as a string because otherwise
10:22 - it might be a
10:24 - because otherwise it's a number and then
10:26 - just return way done
10:28 - nowhere it's going to be even easier to
10:30 - convert USD to eth because we've already
10:33 - done that so just copy that one line and
10:36 - we should be good to go
10:38 - all right so let's actually deploy these
10:41 - nfts or deploy these contracts not
10:43 - enough these obviously
10:45 - so you already have your inferior set up
10:48 - if not you can scroll back and I'm
10:50 - showing you earlier how to set it up but
10:53 - if you're this at this part of the video
10:56 - just smash the like button because
10:57 - you've already seen that
10:59 - now you can hit that deploy button there
11:02 - and that will pop up open the little
11:05 - window that you can see right now and
11:07 - we're going to be using the girly
11:08 - Network so just select that and it will
11:12 - start going ahead and deploying and
11:14 - building our contract hold on a second
11:16 - there's some interesting things
11:17 - happening there
11:19 - so it looks like there is some sort of
11:22 - issues with the import
11:25 - and the reason is we have contracts
11:28 - twice so just remove the second one or
11:30 - first one whichever basically opens up
11:33 - contract and that should be good in
11:35 - theory
11:36 - all right let's try to run it again
11:39 - looks like it's working wait a second
11:42 - okay now Uber Uber its discount nft has
11:46 - some sort of issues
11:48 - and that looks like that's a typo so
11:51 - instead of discount you want to go with
11:53 - discount with t
11:56 - all right let's try again
11:58 - looking good so far
12:00 - okay so looks like we made that same
12:04 - mistake again let's fix that oh yeah two
12:07 - more places line seven and eight
12:09 - hopefully you didn't make these mistakes
12:11 - and you're already deployed but that's
12:13 - all right if you did now is the time for
12:16 - you to debug again
12:18 - interesting
12:20 - oh okay so there's you all right
12:23 - I'll learn to type at some point I'm
12:25 - sorry that's all right so looking good
12:27 - this looks way more promising and
12:31 - there it is I think
12:34 - yes okay yeah execute command finish
12:37 - running command so that means deployment
12:39 - is completed and we are good to move on
12:42 - to the next step
12:44 - all right so now we're gonna go ahead
12:46 - and check whether the user has a
12:48 - discount nft or doesn't
12:50 - so what we're going to do is inside of
12:52 - our cart jsx there is a use effect
12:56 - which is the check which is a which has
12:58 - a check discount function in there so
13:01 - you just want to pop in a try catch and
13:03 - obviously if if it fails then just
13:05 - console log the error
13:07 - and in a try Clause you just want to say
13:10 - provider and it will be new ethers
13:12 - provider and then pass in windowed at
13:14 - ethereum that's the code snippet that uh
13:17 - metamask passes into the browser and
13:19 - injects it in there
13:21 - then we're going to go ahead create the
13:22 - signer which is going to be
13:24 - provider.getsigner
13:27 - and we're going to be saving the
13:30 - discount nft address
13:33 - it's going to be Uber discount
13:35 - nft.networks five which is the Gurley
13:37 - Network and then dot address so we're
13:41 - going to be looking there
13:43 - and we're going to have the discount nft
13:45 - contract passing in the discount of the
13:47 - address passing in the ABI and the
13:51 - signer
13:52 - now we're going to say cons to balance
13:54 - equals await discount nft contract dot
13:58 - balance off and then passing the signer
14:00 - dot get signer
14:02 - sign in to get address and xero
14:06 - so we're gonna console log it
14:08 - and they previously declared yeah you
14:11 - state we're gonna we're gonna save the
14:13 - actual balance so set this counted and
14:16 - we're going to be converting whatever we
14:17 - get back to a number and we're gonna say
14:20 - balance.2 string so what's gonna happen
14:23 - is we're gonna get back the balance
14:26 - we're going to convert it to string
14:29 - because otherwise it's a big number
14:31 - and convert that into an actual number
14:34 - that we can work with and if that is
14:36 - greater than zero
14:38 - and we're going to be saving a true or
14:40 - false clause whether that is greater
14:42 - than or less than zero so that's what's
14:45 - going to be in the set discounted state
14:49 - so with that said let's check it out so
14:52 - we're gonna go ahead refresh the app and
14:55 - so there's one item in the cart
14:57 - I'm gonna go ahead connect metamask with
15:00 - the lovely rainbow kit
15:02 - and the balance is currently zero
15:04 - meaning that I do not have the nft so
15:07 - obviously there is zero discount being
15:09 - applied and now that's actually a mint
15:12 - the nft
15:13 - all right so let's mint the nfds so
15:18 - moving it into the mint nft function in
15:21 - cart jsx we're going to go ahead create
15:24 - a provider in the try clause
15:27 - the usual drill just fetch the ethers
15:30 - provider using the injected code from
15:33 - metamask then we're going to go ahead
15:35 - create a signer which is going to be
15:37 - provider.getsigner and then create the
15:39 - address structure the address so that
15:42 - basically the girly deployment address
15:45 - of the Uber Eats discount nft and we're
15:48 - gonna be saying we're gonna go ahead
15:50 - create a contract instance so discount
15:53 - nft contract equals new ethers.contract
15:56 - passing the address pass in the ABI and
16:00 - then pass in the signer then we're going
16:02 - to go ahead and generate the transaction
16:04 - which will be discount nft contract so
16:07 - we're going to be using the Min function
16:09 - of the NFC contract passing the user
16:13 - address which we get from rainbow kit by
16:16 - the way then we're gonna be passing in
16:18 - the value so that's how much we're going
16:21 - to be paying for the the nft so that's
16:24 - going to be 0.00 ether and then we're
16:26 - going to passing it as the payload and
16:29 - now we're just waiting so await
16:32 - transaction.weight function that's an
16:34 - async function take some time blockchain
16:37 - isn't the fastest thing in the world
16:39 - and we're gonna we're gonna console log
16:42 - once the nft is minted so let's take a
16:44 - look at that connecting the wallet and
16:48 - minting and it's actually and there you
16:51 - go there is the balance now mind you
16:53 - that is in way I believe so there you
16:56 - have it the nft now is minted
17:00 - all right now let's actually handle the
17:02 - purchase and once this is done we are
17:05 - actually finished with this app so there
17:07 - is a handle purchase function now inside
17:11 - there usual try catch because we are
17:13 - working with blockchain so in the try
17:15 - clause
17:17 - we're gonna go ahead create the usual
17:19 - provider we've already done this now it
17:22 - comes the address instance or the
17:25 - contract contract instance but this is
17:26 - going to be the ubereats instance on the
17:29 - other one so pass in the address ABI
17:32 - signer yada yada and now we're going to
17:35 - go ahead and calculate the total cart
17:38 - value so this is something new that we
17:40 - haven't done before now this is going to
17:42 - be this is going to reduce a function
17:45 - called reduce from the job from
17:47 - JavaScript I'm sure you're familiar with
17:49 - it but basically all it does is it Loops
17:51 - through an array and then just adds
17:53 - everything up or does a certain thing
17:56 - and then we're gonna have two variables
17:58 - that we pass in and basically add those
18:00 - two together and we are going to have
18:03 - a starter value which is going to be
18:06 - zero so basically all that's happening
18:07 - is we have the current value and the
18:10 - previous value and we're just going to
18:12 - add the current value to the previous
18:13 - value and therefore it will be summed up
18:16 - and we always start with zero so that is
18:19 - going to be your total USD value now
18:21 - we're going to be converting in into so
18:25 - that's using the USD to wave function
18:27 - that we've already built earlier and we
18:31 - will now check whether the user has the
18:34 - nft these content ft so we're going to
18:38 - set everything up
18:39 - for that so we're going to create the
18:41 - discount nft instance using the address
18:44 - the ABI and the signer
18:46 - and we're going to check the balance so
18:49 - we're going to pass in the signer
18:50 - signer's address and then zero and that
18:53 - will return the balance of that specific
18:56 - nft in the user's bullet so if the user
19:00 - has more than zero then we're going to
19:02 - be applying the discount on the total
19:06 - value or like the total whale total way
19:09 - of value that was hard to say so we're
19:13 - going to say total way and then just get
19:15 - the get 70 and we're going to be
19:17 - multiplying it with 70 and then divided
19:20 - by 100 so that will give us the 70 that
19:23 - we're looking for so the 30 discount and
19:28 - we're going to be setting the set
19:29 - discounted to true and that will update
19:32 - the dollar amount and now we're going to
19:34 - go ahead and create the transaction so
19:38 - wait Uber Eats contracts dot by cart
19:41 - passing the total weight value that
19:45 - either gets modified or it doesn't so if
19:48 - it does if if it doesn't it is going to
19:51 - be the full value if it does then it's
19:53 - going to be the 70 of that value
19:57 - and the parameters are going to be value
20:01 - total away gas limit a hundred thousand
20:04 - let's just increase it from the usual 30
20:07 - 000 just so we have like extra room it's
20:10 - also it's free so it's whatever
20:12 - and we're going to be setting the gas
20:14 - price to null now
20:17 - we're going to create the receipt and
20:20 - we're going to be waiting for it and if
20:23 - everything goes successfully
20:26 - we'll just route back to the initial
20:28 - page of this app so this page
20:31 - technically all right now let's add all
20:34 - these things to our cart and now what
20:37 - we're going to do is as you can see
20:38 - because we've already minted this nft
20:40 - the discount is already applied you
20:43 - don't even have to worry about it and so
20:45 - now we can just say place order and
20:48 - that's the
20:49 - eighth equivalent of the
20:52 - 4.4.90 so let's go ahead hit place that
20:55 - order and as you can see the loading
20:57 - screen works and it just threw you back
20:59 - straight to the home page so with that
21:01 - said that pretty much wraps up this
21:04 - build thank you so much for watching as
21:06 - always if you have any questions let us
21:07 - know in the comment section down below
21:09 - with that said I'm signing out peace

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're gonna be building the ubereats wet 3 Clone with nexjs we're gonna be using infuro to connect it to the ethereum blockchain now we are going to be creating a bunch of nfts that will give you discounts in this app and we will be able to check whether the user has it or doesn't and then calculate the subtotal we're also going to have a bunch of goodies in this app so with that said let's go ahead and get started okay so as usual we're going to be using the clever programmer custom CLI tool that we built for you so just make sure you are on the latest version and let's go ahead and just type in npx lover programmer pop in your email then your name and then we're gonna be selecting the solidity Uber Eats option and while that takes a while it'll also open up infuri for you so just make sure you have an account if you don't have one already and create a new new project but in the mean what meantime the terminal is apparently done and it opened up vs code so that's nice so let's just check out how the app looks like or don't and let's just go ahead create a new API key on inferior so we're going to be selecting the web3 API that is their combined all the chains that you will ever need a type of API so just name it whatever ubereats but just make sure you don't have space in between them because later on when you try to connect it to your vs code it is better not to have space in the project now it'll take a little bit to load and then this is what you're gonna see if you select endpoints that's all your RPC URLs that you will need all right let's go back to our code vs code and let's actually connect it to our vs code so if you don't have truffle already installed into your vs code now is the time to go ahead and do it it's a free extension it's just where every other extension is and just make sure you disconnect all the networks and then you just reconnect so you're starting this session with a fresh connection so go ahead straight away just connect to your infuria and uberes will pop up immediately and there you go that is everything you will need for this one now straight away let's go into our Uber Eats discount nft.sol file that is created by the CLI tool so let's go ahead and get started with that too let's set out the nft collection so we're going to be using solidity version zero eight zero so just make sure you specify that version and then we're going to be importing a couple of things from open Zeppelin so this is going to be an ERC 1155 compliant token so let's import that and also you want to make sure that whenever you're importing in previous builds we already have these issues when you're importing you want to import from open sapling contracts not just contract okay and we're going to be importing ownable because these nfts will have someone who owns them and let's actually create the ubereats discount nft that is an ownable ERC 1155 token so this is going to be a child to those now we're going to create a string that's going to be a public string and that will be the token URI and we're also going to go ahead create a Constructor this is actually like standard and ft procedures so you need a token URI you're gonna need the Constructor because that's how you whenever you're minting that's what's gonna run Constructor string memory token URI and then it's going to be ERC 1155 and then we're gonna have a mint function passing in the account the amount and this is going to be a payable minting function meaning the user has to pay for these nfts to be minted so we're gonna make sure that the user at least sends 0.01 ether otherwise we're gonna have to reject this minting and we're gonna be minting the nfts into his or her account and we're also going to be passing in a couple of other attributes alongside with the amount so with that said that is your Uber Eats discount nft let's go ahead and move on to the next step all right so let's actually set up a couple of things for this nft so first off we're going to be going ahead and opening up our Chrome and we're going to be creating a ipfs API key the reason is when you have an nft you will have to sort the image somewhere and that's usually going on ipfs now again just don't leave any spaces in the project name so there you have it and now what we're going to be doing is we're going to be enabling dedicated gateways because that's something inferior can do and it's super cool so just pop in knit your name clever programmer whatever you really want to but what this will enable you to do is that it will create a sub domain under infuro's ipfs and that is going to be your own dedicated Gateway so once you save it you can go back to your vs code and we're going to be opening a terminal but you want to also make sure that you open it under the data folder so by default vs code only opens it under ubereats infuro so basically the project and then you can either CD into so just say CD data or just open it in the data folder directly so in there's this nice little Lamborghini image and the nft Json so the nft Json is going to contain all your NFC metadata and this is what we'll be using later so let's just rename it so it will be Uber Eats subscription description again a subscription for ubereats whatever you can that doesn't really matter but that's what you're going to show on show up on openc and you can also pop in your uh sub domain so basically what we're going to be doing is inside the terminal we're going to say inferior auth this is going to be creating a variable equals and then just the project ID column API Secret so that's exactly what's happening I will just save it into your terminal session and then you can invoke it later so you don't have to always copy paste these and then we're going to say curlex post so basically an API call to using the inferior auth indication to this ipfs that impure is providing pure uh ipf is the same dot impure.io column 501 API v0 add and then we're going to be attaching the file so we're going to say that Lambo nft and the reason why and this is where it becomes important that you are in the correct folder with your terminal otherwise the lambo nft will obviously not be found so what this gun is going to do is this will just upload the image to the ipfs now we're gonna have to because ipfs cleared itself and if you pin it it won't clear that particular file so now what we're going to say is going to be another a post call but to slash API v0 pin slash add and in the arguments we're going to be popping in the ipfs we're going to say slash ipfs slash and whatever comes back as your hash as a response from the previous requests just paste that there and that should be good to go once again this hash goes right here if it wasn't clear and then you will see your pins that is supposed to be the same hash that just came back or that you just pinned so now you can go ahead and put that at the end of the link and you will also want to make sure that you are copying your dedicated Gateway because that's the reason why we have it just paste it there and that will be your URL for the image so nice that works perfectly now we're gonna repeat this exact same process but instead of the image we're going to be uploading and then pinning the nft Json file so I'm just going to go through this fast so we're going to say so instead of file Lambo and nft whereas a nft the Json the reason is for now we only uploaded the image but we haven't uploaded the metadata so now we created the metadata file but we have to upload and pin that and that's what's going to be used by the nft okay we uploaded it now let's go ahead and pin that guy okay there seems to be some sort of error oh and that is because there was a typo so if you type ifura instead of infuria that's obviously not going to work okay and now there you go it is working perfectly and now we're gonna create the pins XD file and we're just gonna paste the two we're just gonna paste the metadata location so that whenever we are creating the NFC we'll be pasting this link in there so that should be good to go let's move on to the next part oh all right so let's now start converting the US dollar values into Wei and ether the currency of the blockchain so if you're going to cart.jsx on 944 there is a const USD to way function it's going to be super simple super quick basically you're just gonna say const E equals USD USD to eth and on line 36 as you can see it's already defined what that is so you can just change that it's not the scope of this project to include the live updating so just move on now we're going to be converting it to way and that's going to be using the ethers Library so we're going to say ethers.utls.parse ether and then just pass in the eth.to string or the eighth value as as a string because otherwise it might be a because otherwise it's a number and then just return way done nowhere it's going to be even easier to convert USD to eth because we've already done that so just copy that one line and we should be good to go all right so let's actually deploy these nfts or deploy these contracts not enough these obviously so you already have your inferior set up if not you can scroll back and I'm showing you earlier how to set it up but if you're this at this part of the video just smash the like button because you've already seen that now you can hit that deploy button there and that will pop up open the little window that you can see right now and we're going to be using the girly Network so just select that and it will start going ahead and deploying and building our contract hold on a second there's some interesting things happening there so it looks like there is some sort of issues with the import and the reason is we have contracts twice so just remove the second one or first one whichever basically opens up contract and that should be good in theory all right let's try to run it again looks like it's working wait a second okay now Uber Uber its discount nft has some sort of issues and that looks like that's a typo so instead of discount you want to go with discount with t all right let's try again looking good so far okay so looks like we made that same mistake again let's fix that oh yeah two more places line seven and eight hopefully you didn't make these mistakes and you're already deployed but that's all right if you did now is the time for you to debug again interesting oh okay so there's you all right I'll learn to type at some point I'm sorry that's all right so looking good this looks way more promising and there it is I think yes okay yeah execute command finish running command so that means deployment is completed and we are good to move on to the next step all right so now we're gonna go ahead and check whether the user has a discount nft or doesn't so what we're going to do is inside of our cart jsx there is a use effect which is the check which is a which has a check discount function in there so you just want to pop in a try catch and obviously if if it fails then just console log the error and in a try Clause you just want to say provider and it will be new ethers provider and then pass in windowed at ethereum that's the code snippet that uh metamask passes into the browser and injects it in there then we're going to go ahead create the signer which is going to be provider.getsigner and we're going to be saving the discount nft address it's going to be Uber discount nft.networks five which is the Gurley Network and then dot address so we're going to be looking there and we're going to have the discount nft contract passing in the discount of the address passing in the ABI and the signer now we're going to say cons to balance equals await discount nft contract dot balance off and then passing the signer dot get signer sign in to get address and xero so we're gonna console log it and they previously declared yeah you state we're gonna we're gonna save the actual balance so set this counted and we're going to be converting whatever we get back to a number and we're gonna say balance.2 string so what's gonna happen is we're gonna get back the balance we're going to convert it to string because otherwise it's a big number and convert that into an actual number that we can work with and if that is greater than zero and we're going to be saving a true or false clause whether that is greater than or less than zero so that's what's going to be in the set discounted state so with that said let's check it out so we're gonna go ahead refresh the app and so there's one item in the cart I'm gonna go ahead connect metamask with the lovely rainbow kit and the balance is currently zero meaning that I do not have the nft so obviously there is zero discount being applied and now that's actually a mint the nft all right so let's mint the nfds so moving it into the mint nft function in cart jsx we're going to go ahead create a provider in the try clause the usual drill just fetch the ethers provider using the injected code from metamask then we're going to go ahead create a signer which is going to be provider.getsigner and then create the address structure the address so that basically the girly deployment address of the Uber Eats discount nft and we're gonna be saying we're gonna go ahead create a contract instance so discount nft contract equals new ethers.contract passing the address pass in the ABI and then pass in the signer then we're going to go ahead and generate the transaction which will be discount nft contract so we're going to be using the Min function of the NFC contract passing the user address which we get from rainbow kit by the way then we're gonna be passing in the value so that's how much we're going to be paying for the the nft so that's going to be 0.00 ether and then we're going to passing it as the payload and now we're just waiting so await transaction.weight function that's an async function take some time blockchain isn't the fastest thing in the world and we're gonna we're gonna console log once the nft is minted so let's take a look at that connecting the wallet and minting and it's actually and there you go there is the balance now mind you that is in way I believe so there you have it the nft now is minted all right now let's actually handle the purchase and once this is done we are actually finished with this app so there is a handle purchase function now inside there usual try catch because we are working with blockchain so in the try clause we're gonna go ahead create the usual provider we've already done this now it comes the address instance or the contract contract instance but this is going to be the ubereats instance on the other one so pass in the address ABI signer yada yada and now we're going to go ahead and calculate the total cart value so this is something new that we haven't done before now this is going to be this is going to reduce a function called reduce from the job from JavaScript I'm sure you're familiar with it but basically all it does is it Loops through an array and then just adds everything up or does a certain thing and then we're gonna have two variables that we pass in and basically add those two together and we are going to have a starter value which is going to be zero so basically all that's happening is we have the current value and the previous value and we're just going to add the current value to the previous value and therefore it will be summed up and we always start with zero so that is going to be your total USD value now we're going to be converting in into so that's using the USD to wave function that we've already built earlier and we will now check whether the user has the nft these content ft so we're going to set everything up for that so we're going to create the discount nft instance using the address the ABI and the signer and we're going to check the balance so we're going to pass in the signer signer's address and then zero and that will return the balance of that specific nft in the user's bullet so if the user has more than zero then we're going to be applying the discount on the total value or like the total whale total way of value that was hard to say so we're going to say total way and then just get the get 70 and we're going to be multiplying it with 70 and then divided by 100 so that will give us the 70 that we're looking for so the 30 discount and we're going to be setting the set discounted to true and that will update the dollar amount and now we're going to go ahead and create the transaction so wait Uber Eats contracts dot by cart passing the total weight value that either gets modified or it doesn't so if it does if if it doesn't it is going to be the full value if it does then it's going to be the 70 of that value and the parameters are going to be value total away gas limit a hundred thousand let's just increase it from the usual 30 000 just so we have like extra room it's also it's free so it's whatever and we're going to be setting the gas price to null now we're going to create the receipt and we're going to be waiting for it and if everything goes successfully we'll just route back to the initial page of this app so this page technically all right now let's add all these things to our cart and now what we're going to do is as you can see because we've already minted this nft the discount is already applied you don't even have to worry about it and so now we can just say place order and that's the eighth equivalent of the 4.4.90 so let's go ahead hit place that order and as you can see the loading screen works and it just threw you back straight to the home page so with that said that pretty much wraps up this build thank you so much for watching as always if you have any questions let us know in the comment section down below with that said I'm signing out peace
