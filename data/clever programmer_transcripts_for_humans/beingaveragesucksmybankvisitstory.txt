00:00 - hey guys what's up this is Kazi from
00:02 - clever programmer calm I wanted to talk
00:05 - about being dangerous and not in danger
00:11 - this concept is inspired by Grant
00:13 - Cardone who is somebody I follow and
00:15 - he's one of the top 10 most influential
00:18 - CEOs of all time unbelievable
00:22 - personality should follow him and I was
00:25 - reading his book be obsessed or be
00:27 - average which is another thing I want to
00:31 - talk about too many people in this world
00:33 - are just okay with being average and the
00:37 - part that sucks is that they have the
00:39 - potential to not to be average and I'm
00:42 - not just talking about from everything
00:45 - is perfect and the sky is amazing and
00:48 - everything is unbelievable I mean
00:50 - actually from like I know people
00:53 - genuinely who are very talented very
00:55 - skilled and undersell themselves and
01:00 - also people who will refuse to be more
01:06 - helpful to other people so today for
01:09 - example I went to my bank I have a few
01:14 - bank accounts some of them happen to be
01:17 - at Chase and then at Bank of America and
01:20 - I went to chase and I chases a great
01:24 - Bank unbelievable I've had great
01:26 - customer service with them but today in
01:28 - particular I talked with one of their
01:32 - people and I had a question and after I
01:37 - asked him this question this person this
01:40 - guy he would not even try to help me
01:45 - like after I asked the question he
01:48 - pretty much said sorry he pretty much
01:53 - said
01:54 - oh wow I really wish I could I could
01:58 - help you you know but it's just uh it's
02:00 - just kind of my hand out of my hands and
02:02 - I'm like hey hey look I'm just asking
02:05 - you for your advice if you could just
02:06 - think outside the box here for a second
02:08 - and just give me a tip here because
02:11 - that's why I really came I know I could
02:13 - have just done this online but I'm
02:15 - actually looking for a little bit of an
02:17 - opinion here and it would be really
02:19 - helpful
02:20 - he just says uh you know I would love to
02:24 - help you but you know maybe maybe go to
02:28 - Bank of America and you can talk with
02:30 - them I'm like how would that be any
02:33 - different then he says you know to be
02:37 - honest uh you could Google nowadays
02:42 - Google is unbelievable and it's always
02:45 - surprising the kind of stuff I can find
02:47 - up there so and I'm just looking at this
02:51 - guy in his eyes like are you actually
02:54 - serious right now
02:56 - like I I don't know Google and how that
02:59 - works and I didn't bought like do you
03:02 - know how condescending and patronizing
03:04 - you're being by talking like that to
03:06 - your customer but when I was sitting
03:09 - there I didn't say anything I said okay
03:12 - no problem
03:13 - um like
03:18 - how about even just point me in the
03:20 - right direction have me talk to a
03:22 - manager just say hey look man I don't
03:24 - have this information go to this person
03:28 - like a lot of this house what I find is
03:30 - people will do exactly what it says like
03:32 - in the bullet points of their job
03:34 - description and then just not do
03:36 - anything outside of it whereas they can
03:39 - provide so much value if you guys
03:40 - watched the route and a rejection
03:42 - challenged by this guy who did a TED
03:44 - talk on it he would do he would ask
03:47 - crazy things to people at customer
03:50 - service or any random people to do crazy
03:52 - things that he wanted them to say no so
03:55 - he could get rejected and recorded but
03:58 - he went to this one Dunkin Donuts and
04:00 - asked her hey once you're done making
04:02 - these Donuts for me can you put him in
04:05 - an Olympic shaped rings and she looked
04:08 - at him and she went in this deep
04:12 - deliberate thought for like 5-10 minutes
04:16 - and she actually was brainstorming ways
04:20 - these crazy ways how she can actually do
04:23 - this for him and ultimately she took 20
04:26 - or 30 extra minutes and she gave him
04:31 - Olympic shaped Donuts do you think
04:36 - that's part of her job description do
04:38 - you think it actually says when did
04:40 - they're hiring her in the interviewing
04:41 - process like we're gonna hire you for X
04:44 - dollars an hour one of your job
04:46 - descriptions is to actually make Olympic
04:49 - shape donuts no that was not part of it
04:53 - but she still went and did it
04:56 - see I think people have the ability to
04:58 - do things that are beyond your scope but
05:01 - it always starts with I can't versus how
05:05 - can I and that's one of my videos I
05:07 - think that's actually going those
05:10 - launched recently so check it out
05:14 - I can't versus how can I too many people
05:21 - do that to them that guy he could have
05:23 - been more helpful like look if you don't
05:26 - have to answer right up in here and you
05:28 - can't give me an answer like this is
05:29 - fine how about you problem solved with
05:31 - me like a human being that's what I do
05:34 - with people like there are many times
05:36 - where I don't know the answer but I have
05:38 - never given up on the person I will
05:41 - spend like if the call ends and I
05:43 - couldn't help that person I will find a
05:46 - solution and then call you back a few
05:48 - days later when I'm working with clients
05:49 - and if I can't get their business and
05:51 - they said no I will spend days and weeks
05:55 - figuring out how can I provide a service
05:57 - for them that is so valuable for them
06:00 - like what's their perspective here and I
06:02 - would keep coming back with counter
06:04 - proposals and there have been some crazy
06:06 - times where these clients were just gone
06:08 - and I was able to work with them again
06:12 - it goes beyond like money or whatever
06:14 - for me I have to solve the problem and
06:17 - give my utmost best when I'm and when
06:19 - I'm at work or really doing anything so
06:23 - stop being average because of that right

06:31 - overcome being average you guys have the
06:34 - fortitude to do that by just trying to
