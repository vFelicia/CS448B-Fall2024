00:01 - hey guys what's up this is ky from
00:03 - clever program.com and today I want to
00:07 - talk about how you should use and think
00:10 - about your
00:12 - money
00:14 - so one tip I would like to offer you
00:18 - that will hopefully change your
00:20 - perspective on how you think about this
00:22 - is like a lot of people think about it
00:25 - as this very like static thing that you
00:29 - just pile up or save and then you use it
00:32 - for whatever reason like purchasing
00:35 - something but you should think of money
00:42 - as something that you can trade for
00:44 - another thing right and I know it sounds
00:47 - obvious or like duh yeah I trade my
00:49 - money in to go to Best Buy to buy some
00:51 - electronic equipment or trade it in for
00:53 - a car but I mean that you should start
00:56 - focusing on trading your money for skill
01:01 - so one thing that helped me a lot and
01:04 - how I was able to get a lot better in
01:08 - programming in a much shorter amount of
01:11 - time was as I started learning about
01:15 - programming I would do my other job
01:17 - where I would do where I would coach
01:18 - people in chess and then I wanted to get
01:21 - better at
01:22 - programming so what I did was I was like
01:27 - okay if I'm making certain amount of
01:29 - money money from teaching my
01:31 - chess I can trade that money trade that
01:37 - skill for the skill of programming so
01:41 - I'm using my chess skill and then I
01:43 - would take that money and I would give
01:45 - it to somebody else so they could teach
01:47 - me about the skill of computer
01:50 - programming and while I was learning on
01:52 - my own I was using this thing to help me
01:56 - boost because then I was able to work
01:57 - with like professional software
01:58 - Developers and learn the uh skills and
02:02 - the trades that they
02:04 - had or if I wanted to vice versa learn
02:07 - about Chess and I already knew
02:10 - programming I would start using my
02:12 - programming money like in a dynamic way
02:15 - to trade it for a skill so we a lot of
02:18 - the times use money to purchase things
02:20 - purchase static things which you know a
02:22 - lot of the times don't have a return
02:23 - value on them like you don't have an Roi
02:26 - or a return on your investment you'll
02:27 - just purchase some kind of liability or
02:29 - or maybe sometimes you purchase an asset
02:31 - you'll purchase a property or uh put it
02:34 - into stock most of the times we'll spend
02:36 - it on either buying clothes buying a
02:38 - jacket purchasing gloves or whatever
02:40 - right some random thing but if you start
02:42 - using your money to trade it for
02:45 - skill now you start getting to the next
02:48 - level and what a lot of the times
02:51 - happens is that you'll think okay I'm I
02:53 - I just got paid like $30 or $50 from
02:58 - somebody else I don't want to put that
03:02 - much money in but essentially how you
03:04 - should think of it
03:05 - is I just gave somebody my time for
03:09 - chess or for something like Photoshop
03:12 - and now I'm trading it in for learning
03:15 - about a skill in Final Cut Pro or I'm
03:17 - learning about a skill in some kind of
03:19 - business thing or cooking or arts and
03:22 - crafts painting whatever right you're
03:24 - trading one skill for
03:27 - another and this way you can start
03:30 - adding on and boosting up your skills
03:32 - really fast and again when you invest in
03:34 - learning and quality learning right not
03:37 - just I hate to say it like this and I
03:40 - don't want to sound like I'm against all
03:42 - schooling and colleges again I think
03:44 - there's a lot of value there but when I
03:47 - for example paid $1,500 for a course at
03:50 - my college
03:55 - where I knew more than my
03:58 - teacher and a lot of people did as well
04:02 - and that teacher really wasn't even a
04:03 - computer science teacher in the first
04:05 - place now that's money that I'm not
04:07 - getting my value back
04:09 - on right but if you trade it in with
04:13 - somebody who's skilled at that task and
04:16 - even if it costs you a little bit more
04:19 - you're now getting value back and again
04:21 - how I thought about it is if I did
04:23 - computer programming right and I worked
04:26 - at like for example I got a computer
04:27 - programming client who I worked for and
04:30 - they paid me money for Designing their
04:32 - website designing a invoicing system and
04:35 - a calendaring system for them for
04:36 - example
04:37 - right and when I would get paid by them
04:41 - I would trade it in and to to learn from
04:44 - a professional developer because how I
04:47 - thought of about it is like I'm trading
04:49 - my
04:50 - really you know crappy skill set for a
04:55 - much higher and a crazy higher level
04:58 - skill set right I didn't think about it
05:00 - like oh let me just keep my money I got
05:02 - my money and I'm just GNA keep it for
05:04 - myself right like whatever money I was
05:06 - getting I was like I'm going to use it
05:09 - to learn from somebody else and if you
05:10 - can hire somebody who you're not paying
05:14 - so much for like you can even hire some
05:16 - people from different countries there
05:18 - are websites that allow you to do like
05:19 - upwork.com for example you can hire
05:22 - people for much cheaper because they're
05:23 - they're in a different country and so if
05:25 - you pay them in their currency it's a
05:27 - lot of
05:28 - money so so essentially like let's say
05:31 - you're getting paid I don't know $10 an
05:33 - hour or $50 an hour $40 an hour right
05:36 - let's say you're getting paid $40 an
05:37 - hour or
05:39 - whatever if you hire somebody else from
05:41 - another country and you're paying them
05:43 - 20 bucks or 30 bucks an hour I mean
05:45 - think of it like holy crap I'm trading
05:47 - in my really terrible skill set you know
05:51 - for a really high level skill set and
05:53 - I'm getting two hours from this person
05:55 - so essentially I'm just learning a new
05:57 - skill becoming an amazing aming
06:00 - programmer amazing whatever right
06:01 - whatever things you're interested in
06:03 - Better Business
06:06 - person for free and as a matter of fact
06:09 - I'm making more money on top of
06:12 - it right even if you're trading in
06:15 - literally 100% of the money you're
06:16 - getting and then giving it and acquiring
06:18 - a new skill but I understand can't do
06:20 - that you got to pay your bills you got
06:21 - to pay for other stuff right that's fine
06:24 - but if you have money left over and you
06:26 - trade it in for a skill I mean you'll be
06:29 - increasing ing so fast in the things
06:32 - that you do because you'll save years of
06:35 - your time and sometimes it's more than
06:37 - years of your time it's a lifetime like
06:40 - when I was Landing my first Consulting
06:43 - gig for software
06:45 - development I had a mentor his name is
06:49 - Nick and if Nick ever watches this video
06:51 - Nick I love you you're awesome I'm still
06:53 - in touch with Nick uh he's actually one
06:56 - of the teachers at full stack Academy uh
06:59 - which is a programming boot camp and
07:01 - it's a really good boot camp um and how
07:04 - programming boot camps work is that in 3
07:06 - months you spend some money there like I
07:09 - don't know a few thousand $10,000 or
07:10 - something and then they pretty much
07:12 - change your life and they will do their
07:15 - best to land you a job and a lot of
07:17 - people actually did end up getting job
07:18 - right off full Academy and Nick helped
07:20 - with that and Nick was one of my mentor
07:23 - who I didn't even you know I wasn't
07:24 - paying him but just because I was such a
07:26 - good student I was crazy I would be like
07:28 - working learning programming and coding
07:30 - skills like 20 hours a day so when I had
07:33 - Nick to help me
07:35 - out he helped me with my Consulting gig
07:38 - and told me what rate I should charge
07:40 - them and because I started off with a
07:42 - really high rate cuz thanks to Nick he
07:44 - told me what to charge I just saved five
07:47 - years of my time maybe more and I had a
07:50 - head start in front of everybody
07:52 - else and it was because I wasn't afraid
07:55 - to take my money give it to somebody who
07:58 - knew much better than me right like I
07:59 - had such a you know shitty skill
08:03 - set and I traded in for a superior high
08:07 - quality trained professional skill set
08:11 - so that's amazing it's essentially like
08:14 - I worked for one
08:15 - hour and somebody with the trained and a
08:18 - high level of skill set was essentially
08:20 - when they give you one hour of their
08:22 - time that's like 20 hours of your time
08:24 - or more so I was almost thinking of it
08:26 - like oh my God I'm earning time I'm
08:28 - saving so much time I'm literally like
08:31 - getting 10 to 20 hours or more per day
08:34 - and I could use that time to either hang
08:38 - out with people I liked and had fun or
08:42 - take that time and just boost myself so
08:44 - much so I could catch up with people who
08:46 - are years ahead of me right you'll hear
08:48 - most people rely on their
08:51 - experience
08:53 - as something that's very important
08:55 - you'll go to a job and people will just
08:57 - try to uh show their super superiority
09:00 - based on their experience and that's
09:01 - because that's how most people learn
09:04 - very linearly right like like this very
09:08 - linearly in one day their skill set is
09:10 - here in two day their skill set is here
09:11 - in three days skill set is here but when
09:14 - you work with somebody who's really good
09:15 - or you trade in your skill for another
09:17 - skill to improve and somebody who's a
09:19 - professional can teach you you're just
09:21 - learning exponentially like your curve
09:22 - is almost like absurd so you catch up to
09:25 - those people they're very fast and and
09:26 - then you end up becoming better than
09:28 - them and then it's not about experience
09:30 - anymore but that's the only way they
09:31 - know how it works that's why sometimes
09:34 - you'll hear in jobs like oh there's so
09:36 - much politics going on and these people
09:37 - think they're better than me even though
09:39 - I'm more skilled and that's the reason
09:41 - why it happens people are like well he
09:43 - spent 10 years you spend one year so it
09:45 - just doesn't make sense how you could
09:47 - have caught up to
09:48 - him but if you think about the skill set
09:51 - and if you use this way of learning yes
09:54 - it does make sense how you caught up to
09:55 - this person so again for me I just spent
09:58 - relent time I'm like I'm I'm a
10:01 - borderline obsessive right when I am
10:03 - learning about a new skill like if it's
10:05 - Jiu-Jitsu I'm just watching Jiu-Jitsu
10:07 - videos while I'm eating I'm just
10:08 - watching Jiu-Jitsu videos while I'm
10:10 - walking around thinking about things I'm
10:12 - watching Jiu-Jitsu videos when I was on
10:14 - my train on Metro like that's what it's
10:16 - about I'm ordering books on Jiu-Jitsu
10:18 - I'm talking to Jiu-Jitsu coaches I got a
10:20 - Jiu-Jitsu membership like it's like my
10:22 - whole world is that and so I just I
10:24 - would pick it up really fast I would try
10:26 - to get a mentor in Jiu-Jitsu as well
10:28 - with Pro programming you know you could
10:31 - use that
10:33 - to learn very quickly and don't be
10:35 - afraid of investing a lot of time in one
10:38 - place because then your rewards are so
10:40 - much better too like you don't have to
10:42 - go about it in such a systematic way
10:43 - like one hour a day for like the next 30
10:46 - days you can do that that's fine but
10:48 - then just understand that the results
10:50 - you're going to get are also going to be
10:52 - in the next 30 or 60 days rather than in
10:54 - one week or whatever right
10:58 - so
11:00 - trade your skill set think of your money
11:04 - that you can actually invest it to earn
11:07 - skills that'll put a very different spin
11:10 - on how you think of money and how you
11:12 - can use it uh I hope this video wasn't
11:15 - lightning I know some of the stuff may
11:17 - seem
11:17 - obvious um and it might be I don't know
11:21 - that's just how I picked up a lot of the
11:24 - things really fast in whatever field I
11:28 - worked in or or started enjoying that's
11:31 - something I wanted to share with you
11:33 - guys maybe you'll find it helpful maybe
11:35 - it'll help
11:36 - you let me know if this helps you uh
11:40 - maybe I can speak more on this subject
11:42 - but the video is getting long so I'm
11:43 - going to stop but thank you guys for
11:45 - listening thank you guys for being here
11:47 - and I can't believe it we're over 10,000
11:50 - subscribers that's amazing and you guys
11:53 - are
11:54 - amazing I have released a new course
11:57 - where I teach you guys how to to create
11:59 - python apps in 30 days or less so if
12:02 - you're wondering if you want to create
12:04 - learn how to create apps or you know um
12:08 - without having to know a million things
12:11 - about theory in Python and start to do
12:14 - some practical
12:15 - projects that's a great course for you
12:18 - to start taking we have a community of
12:21 - coders in our slack channel so everybody
12:24 - who's actually part of that course is
12:25 - also in the slack Channel and then they
12:29 - you guys can talk with each other so you
12:30 - don't get stuck I am always in that
12:32 - slack channel so I'll personally jump in
12:34 - and help you out if you're getting stuck
12:36 - on
12:37 - anything and yeah just check it out you
12:40 - know um I also have bunch of free videos
12:43 - in there that you can like click preview
12:46 - if you don't want to pay for the course
12:47 - that's fine there's a Learn Python
12:49 - course that's free we have thousands of
12:51 - students enrolled in there so you can
12:53 - check out the Learn Python course before
12:56 - you know if you before you want to jump
12:58 - into the oop Learn Python oop course
13:01 - which is a paid
13:03 - course and yeah you have 30-day money
13:06 - back guarantee so if you want to get in
13:07 - there for a few days test some things
13:09 - out if it's too advanced for you you
13:13 - know you can um you know get your money
13:16 - back or you should just ask me first
13:19 - like hey is this too advanced for me but
13:20 - if you know basic python like for this
13:24 - course honestly we haven't even jumped
13:26 - into statements yet in this course cuz
13:28 - we're constantly adding more videos more
13:30 - modules more exercises and projects and
13:33 - we also have live webinars soot live
13:35 - training we haven't even jumped
13:38 - into um like lots of things that have to
13:40 - do with if statements or whatever but if
13:42 - you do if statements and if you do some
13:44 - functions like basic function knowledge
13:45 - that would be helpful to you so those
13:47 - are like uh things that are very
13:49 - supplemental but I think you can pick up
13:52 - most of those things while you're taking
13:53 - the course as well so check that course
13:57 - out out if you have any questions ask me
14:00 - about it we have about I think 20
14:02 - students in that course now so you can
14:05 - ask those students questions about it as
14:07 - well and how they're doing they built
14:09 - some really cool stuff so far uh that
14:12 - they're shared and I'm going to put that
14:14 - actually in the course so like what the
14:16 - students are able to create they're
14:18 - learning like professional development
14:20 - workflows so like how do you put Sublime
14:23 - Text on one side how do you put the
14:25 - command line on one side and then how do
14:27 - you run python script
14:29 - rpts and how can you start working on
14:32 - GUI development into ker how do you
14:35 - install packages and
14:36 - libraries so lots of practical knowledge
14:40 - that will be something that you can
14:42 - actually put on your portfolio as well
14:45 - because that's where I would like to
14:46 - take it you know you go from basic basic
14:49 - basic python like where you don't know
14:51 - no anything don't know nothing it's
14:53 - called and Learn Python and you learn
14:55 - some basic things then we build projects
14:58 - and then maybe you know I want to put
15:00 - some course together for you guys
15:01 - that'll show you how to actually uh like
15:04 - step byep create a website where you can
15:06 - take those projects and put it as a
15:08 - portfolio and then how you Market
15:10 - yourself and how should you train for
15:14 - interviews and how should you position
15:16 - yourself so you have a much higher
15:17 - chance of get getting and Landing either
15:21 - uh independent job as a freelancer or
15:23 - Landing a job at a company and how you
15:25 - can actually use the briefcase technique
15:28 - and help them as well
15:29 - so lots of cool things coming up check
15:32 - it out again thank you for everything
15:34 - thank you for being here um and yeah

15:47 - okay I love you guys take care and I'll
15:49 - see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys what's up this is ky from clever program.com and today I want to talk about how you should use and think about your money so one tip I would like to offer you that will hopefully change your perspective on how you think about this is like a lot of people think about it as this very like static thing that you just pile up or save and then you use it for whatever reason like purchasing something but you should think of money as something that you can trade for another thing right and I know it sounds obvious or like duh yeah I trade my money in to go to Best Buy to buy some electronic equipment or trade it in for a car but I mean that you should start focusing on trading your money for skill so one thing that helped me a lot and how I was able to get a lot better in programming in a much shorter amount of time was as I started learning about programming I would do my other job where I would do where I would coach people in chess and then I wanted to get better at programming so what I did was I was like okay if I'm making certain amount of money money from teaching my chess I can trade that money trade that skill for the skill of programming so I'm using my chess skill and then I would take that money and I would give it to somebody else so they could teach me about the skill of computer programming and while I was learning on my own I was using this thing to help me boost because then I was able to work with like professional software Developers and learn the uh skills and the trades that they had or if I wanted to vice versa learn about Chess and I already knew programming I would start using my programming money like in a dynamic way to trade it for a skill so we a lot of the times use money to purchase things purchase static things which you know a lot of the times don't have a return value on them like you don't have an Roi or a return on your investment you'll just purchase some kind of liability or or maybe sometimes you purchase an asset you'll purchase a property or uh put it into stock most of the times we'll spend it on either buying clothes buying a jacket purchasing gloves or whatever right some random thing but if you start using your money to trade it for skill now you start getting to the next level and what a lot of the times happens is that you'll think okay I'm I I just got paid like $30 or $50 from somebody else I don't want to put that much money in but essentially how you should think of it is I just gave somebody my time for chess or for something like Photoshop and now I'm trading it in for learning about a skill in Final Cut Pro or I'm learning about a skill in some kind of business thing or cooking or arts and crafts painting whatever right you're trading one skill for another and this way you can start adding on and boosting up your skills really fast and again when you invest in learning and quality learning right not just I hate to say it like this and I don't want to sound like I'm against all schooling and colleges again I think there's a lot of value there but when I for example paid $1,500 for a course at my college where I knew more than my teacher and a lot of people did as well and that teacher really wasn't even a computer science teacher in the first place now that's money that I'm not getting my value back on right but if you trade it in with somebody who's skilled at that task and even if it costs you a little bit more you're now getting value back and again how I thought about it is if I did computer programming right and I worked at like for example I got a computer programming client who I worked for and they paid me money for Designing their website designing a invoicing system and a calendaring system for them for example right and when I would get paid by them I would trade it in and to to learn from a professional developer because how I thought of about it is like I'm trading my really you know crappy skill set for a much higher and a crazy higher level skill set right I didn't think about it like oh let me just keep my money I got my money and I'm just GNA keep it for myself right like whatever money I was getting I was like I'm going to use it to learn from somebody else and if you can hire somebody who you're not paying so much for like you can even hire some people from different countries there are websites that allow you to do like upwork.com for example you can hire people for much cheaper because they're they're in a different country and so if you pay them in their currency it's a lot of money so so essentially like let's say you're getting paid I don't know $10 an hour or $50 an hour $40 an hour right let's say you're getting paid $40 an hour or whatever if you hire somebody else from another country and you're paying them 20 bucks or 30 bucks an hour I mean think of it like holy crap I'm trading in my really terrible skill set you know for a really high level skill set and I'm getting two hours from this person so essentially I'm just learning a new skill becoming an amazing aming programmer amazing whatever right whatever things you're interested in Better Business person for free and as a matter of fact I'm making more money on top of it right even if you're trading in literally 100% of the money you're getting and then giving it and acquiring a new skill but I understand can't do that you got to pay your bills you got to pay for other stuff right that's fine but if you have money left over and you trade it in for a skill I mean you'll be increasing ing so fast in the things that you do because you'll save years of your time and sometimes it's more than years of your time it's a lifetime like when I was Landing my first Consulting gig for software development I had a mentor his name is Nick and if Nick ever watches this video Nick I love you you're awesome I'm still in touch with Nick uh he's actually one of the teachers at full stack Academy uh which is a programming boot camp and it's a really good boot camp um and how programming boot camps work is that in 3 months you spend some money there like I don't know a few thousand $10,000 or something and then they pretty much change your life and they will do their best to land you a job and a lot of people actually did end up getting job right off full Academy and Nick helped with that and Nick was one of my mentor who I didn't even you know I wasn't paying him but just because I was such a good student I was crazy I would be like working learning programming and coding skills like 20 hours a day so when I had Nick to help me out he helped me with my Consulting gig and told me what rate I should charge them and because I started off with a really high rate cuz thanks to Nick he told me what to charge I just saved five years of my time maybe more and I had a head start in front of everybody else and it was because I wasn't afraid to take my money give it to somebody who knew much better than me right like I had such a you know shitty skill set and I traded in for a superior high quality trained professional skill set so that's amazing it's essentially like I worked for one hour and somebody with the trained and a high level of skill set was essentially when they give you one hour of their time that's like 20 hours of your time or more so I was almost thinking of it like oh my God I'm earning time I'm saving so much time I'm literally like getting 10 to 20 hours or more per day and I could use that time to either hang out with people I liked and had fun or take that time and just boost myself so much so I could catch up with people who are years ahead of me right you'll hear most people rely on their experience as something that's very important you'll go to a job and people will just try to uh show their super superiority based on their experience and that's because that's how most people learn very linearly right like like this very linearly in one day their skill set is here in two day their skill set is here in three days skill set is here but when you work with somebody who's really good or you trade in your skill for another skill to improve and somebody who's a professional can teach you you're just learning exponentially like your curve is almost like absurd so you catch up to those people they're very fast and and then you end up becoming better than them and then it's not about experience anymore but that's the only way they know how it works that's why sometimes you'll hear in jobs like oh there's so much politics going on and these people think they're better than me even though I'm more skilled and that's the reason why it happens people are like well he spent 10 years you spend one year so it just doesn't make sense how you could have caught up to him but if you think about the skill set and if you use this way of learning yes it does make sense how you caught up to this person so again for me I just spent relent time I'm like I'm I'm a borderline obsessive right when I am learning about a new skill like if it's JiuJitsu I'm just watching JiuJitsu videos while I'm eating I'm just watching JiuJitsu videos while I'm walking around thinking about things I'm watching JiuJitsu videos when I was on my train on Metro like that's what it's about I'm ordering books on JiuJitsu I'm talking to JiuJitsu coaches I got a JiuJitsu membership like it's like my whole world is that and so I just I would pick it up really fast I would try to get a mentor in JiuJitsu as well with Pro programming you know you could use that to learn very quickly and don't be afraid of investing a lot of time in one place because then your rewards are so much better too like you don't have to go about it in such a systematic way like one hour a day for like the next 30 days you can do that that's fine but then just understand that the results you're going to get are also going to be in the next 30 or 60 days rather than in one week or whatever right so trade your skill set think of your money that you can actually invest it to earn skills that'll put a very different spin on how you think of money and how you can use it uh I hope this video wasn't lightning I know some of the stuff may seem obvious um and it might be I don't know that's just how I picked up a lot of the things really fast in whatever field I worked in or or started enjoying that's something I wanted to share with you guys maybe you'll find it helpful maybe it'll help you let me know if this helps you uh maybe I can speak more on this subject but the video is getting long so I'm going to stop but thank you guys for listening thank you guys for being here and I can't believe it we're over 10,000 subscribers that's amazing and you guys are amazing I have released a new course where I teach you guys how to to create python apps in 30 days or less so if you're wondering if you want to create learn how to create apps or you know um without having to know a million things about theory in Python and start to do some practical projects that's a great course for you to start taking we have a community of coders in our slack channel so everybody who's actually part of that course is also in the slack Channel and then they you guys can talk with each other so you don't get stuck I am always in that slack channel so I'll personally jump in and help you out if you're getting stuck on anything and yeah just check it out you know um I also have bunch of free videos in there that you can like click preview if you don't want to pay for the course that's fine there's a Learn Python course that's free we have thousands of students enrolled in there so you can check out the Learn Python course before you know if you before you want to jump into the oop Learn Python oop course which is a paid course and yeah you have 30day money back guarantee so if you want to get in there for a few days test some things out if it's too advanced for you you know you can um you know get your money back or you should just ask me first like hey is this too advanced for me but if you know basic python like for this course honestly we haven't even jumped into statements yet in this course cuz we're constantly adding more videos more modules more exercises and projects and we also have live webinars soot live training we haven't even jumped into um like lots of things that have to do with if statements or whatever but if you do if statements and if you do some functions like basic function knowledge that would be helpful to you so those are like uh things that are very supplemental but I think you can pick up most of those things while you're taking the course as well so check that course out out if you have any questions ask me about it we have about I think 20 students in that course now so you can ask those students questions about it as well and how they're doing they built some really cool stuff so far uh that they're shared and I'm going to put that actually in the course so like what the students are able to create they're learning like professional development workflows so like how do you put Sublime Text on one side how do you put the command line on one side and then how do you run python script rpts and how can you start working on GUI development into ker how do you install packages and libraries so lots of practical knowledge that will be something that you can actually put on your portfolio as well because that's where I would like to take it you know you go from basic basic basic python like where you don't know no anything don't know nothing it's called and Learn Python and you learn some basic things then we build projects and then maybe you know I want to put some course together for you guys that'll show you how to actually uh like step byep create a website where you can take those projects and put it as a portfolio and then how you Market yourself and how should you train for interviews and how should you position yourself so you have a much higher chance of get getting and Landing either uh independent job as a freelancer or Landing a job at a company and how you can actually use the briefcase technique and help them as well so lots of cool things coming up check it out again thank you for everything thank you for being here um and yeah so let me know what you thought about this video if you found anything helpful and I'll jump in there and talk to you okay I love you guys take care and I'll see you in the next video
