00:00 - - Hey you,
00:01 - I am coming to you live from Miami Beach.
00:04 - In this video I'm gonna talk about
00:06 - why you should learn
Python programming in 2019.
00:09 - And thank you, somebody
gave me actually help
00:11 - even with that title as well
00:12 - 'cause that's not one of my strengths.
00:14 - But what I do wanna talk about is
00:16 - why that's gonna be so
important and I wanna talk about
00:18 - a few predictions into the upcoming years.
00:21 - So a little about it is job
opportunity, like overall,
00:24 - why you should actually
give a shit, the big reason,
00:27 - and then we can talk about
some the nerdy reasons
00:30 - why Python is cool.
00:31 - That's the part where I get excited about.
00:33 - Why learn Python?
00:34 - Without any further ado,
let's jump right into it.
00:38 - Why learn Python?
00:39 - Well, what I want to talk about is
00:41 - why learn programming
first of all in general.
00:44 - You wanna be able to
have more job security,
00:47 - you wanna have a job
that most of the world
00:50 - is gonna be moving towards,
but more importantly,
00:53 - you wanna do something that's exciting,
00:54 - you wanna build or create
something from your head
00:56 - and get paid for it.
00:57 - Those are the reasons why I
like programming in general.
01:00 - But if you look at Forbes, I
was reading something on Forbes
01:04 - and it said, by the time its 2030,
01:06 - 800 million jobs will
actually be taken over by AI.
01:12 - For example, your Uber or
your Lyft and all these things
01:15 - that self checkout services.
01:16 - All of these things are
gonna be done by something
01:19 - with AI and probably
not gonna have drivers
01:21 - or people at the cash registry.
01:23 - So what that means is the
worlds gonna be moving to people
01:27 - who can actually program
and create those things.
01:29 - So the job opportunity for
people who are programming
01:33 - will be improving in the upcoming years
01:36 - and the upcoming decades, all right?
01:37 - So that's gonna be one exciting part.
01:40 - Now, why Python specifically,
01:42 - well because most of this is
gonna require data science,
01:45 - machine learning,
01:46 - and Python is actually one of
the best languages for that,
01:51 - and it's becoming hotter and
hotter for those reasons.
01:54 - So its becoming the most common
than norm for when it comes
01:59 - to data science, machine
learning, what have you.
02:01 - That's gonna a skills sets
that's gonna be tougher
02:03 - for you to learn but if you learn it,
02:04 - you're gonna be pretty much unstoppable
02:07 - in the upcoming years.
02:08 - So that's one huge reason
I mentioned Python.
02:11 - Other reasons why I mentioned Python,
02:13 - I mentioned it in lots of my other videos
02:15 - like Top Four Programming
Languages to Learn First
02:17 - or Top Five Programming
Languages to Learn First,
02:20 - but the reason I mention Python so much
02:22 - is because its ease of use,
02:24 - how close it is to reading like English,
02:28 - the writing is a lot easier
and its just lots of things,
02:31 - just work common scenically.
02:33 - For example, if you're
doing something in C, C++,
02:36 - you gotta tell the
freaking thing what type,
02:38 - what data type you expect
this function to return.
02:41 - Sometimes if you don't do that,
02:43 - the function will break down.
02:44 - So these are more of
the nerdy things, right?
02:46 - And if you are new to coding,
that thing can stop you
02:49 - in your tracks because if you're new,
02:51 - you don't freaking know
what data types even are,
02:54 - much less what the data type
the function is gonna return.
02:57 - So good luck learning about
a function which requires you
03:00 - to know data types when
you don't know data types.
03:02 - So, it just adds more complexity
03:04 - and that's just one example of it.
03:07 - Python, there's such
simple tools you can use
03:10 - to actually run Python.
03:11 - For example, if you look up
Repl.it, R-E-P-L-dot-I-T,
03:15 - the CEO and founder of Repl.it
03:18 - actually worked on lots of other things.
03:20 - Like he was an engineer at Facebook,
03:22 - and he founded, obviously,
Repl.it, which is now used
03:25 - by many, many different
companies including Google.
03:28 - Amajad made a fantastic tool.
03:32 - You can go on this tool
03:32 - and you can use some
other languages too there.
03:36 - One of the languages that's
really easy to use online there
03:39 - is Python, and you can
actually just run your code.
03:42 - You don't have to install anything,
03:43 - you can just get started.
03:45 - So it's really good for
if you're a beginner,
03:48 - and its also really good if you are
03:50 - even a more intermediate developer
03:53 - because the skill set of
this will take you forever
03:56 - to master, right?
03:56 - 'Cause programming ultimately thinking,
03:59 - the syntax doesn't matter so much.
04:00 - But you also don't want the
syntax to stop you from learning
04:04 - or improving and getting better faster.
04:07 - So those are a lot of the reasons
04:08 - why I am such a big proponent of Python.
04:13 - The community of Python is fantastic.
04:15 - If you go to events like Pycon
that take place every year,
04:18 - I mean, those are some of
the most amazing events
04:23 - you can go to, and when it comes
to lots of other languages,
04:26 - they have their own, but Pycon
is personally my favorite.
04:31 - Other than that, besides having
better job opportunities,
04:37 - salaries for developers
04:38 - ranging from $60,000 to $70,000 a year
04:42 - all the way to about
$300,000 a year or more,
04:44 - but it depends what type of
job you're doing obviously.
04:47 - For example, if you are
doing something very basic,
04:50 - you are not very good at Python,
04:53 - something that most other
people are dealing with,
04:55 - just for example, if you're
doing web development,
04:57 - which is still a useful skill
but there's so many people
05:01 - that are web developers.
05:03 - You can be making between
$16,000 to $100,000 a year.
05:08 - But, if you are a quant and
you're a data scientist,
05:12 - then its very possible you
could actually be making
05:15 - around $200,000, $300,000 a year or more.
05:19 - Like at Wall Street,
05:20 - some of these quants are
making $500,000 a year.
05:24 - That's a really high number
but I actually wanna tell you
05:27 - what that range can look like,
05:29 - depending on your skill set,
05:31 - your ability to be irreplaceable,
05:33 - like how hard it is to replace you, right,
05:36 - And then how good you are at what you do.
05:38 - This is something Bob Proctor
talks about which I love,
05:41 - and he said, "Three things
will determine your income.
05:46 - "One is the demand for
what it is that you do,
05:50 - "second is how good you are at that thing,
05:53 - "and third, which is actually
one of the most important,
05:56 - the third thing is, how
hard is it to replace you?
06:01 - So Python, there's huge demand.
06:03 - If you take the time
and become good at it,
06:05 - that's gonna be amazing, right?
06:06 - If you can take the time
to become good at it.
06:08 - And number three, if you become
so good that its really hard
06:13 - to replace you or you're
doing something so difficult
06:16 - that its really hard to replace you,
06:18 - you're automatically gonna be at a point
06:20 - where you can demand a much higher income
06:23 - without being irreplaceable.
06:25 - So those are a lot of the
reasons why I love Python.
06:28 - Now, some of the more
technical reasons are that
06:30 - its a very well developed language
06:32 - with an amazing community.
06:34 - So for a lot of things,
you can go on GitHub
06:36 - and you can look up these projects
06:38 - that are already completed,
06:39 - and there's a big community support,
06:42 - so you can actually just
use a lot of those libraries
06:45 - to make things work for yourself
06:47 - and most of it is really straightforward.
06:50 - Most of the stuff you
can just do pip install
06:52 - and install these new packages,
06:54 - you can bring in new
libraries into your own code
06:57 - and be able to work on
these much bigger projects
07:00 - without running into even
installation problems.
07:04 - Then other nerdy reasons
that are good is that
07:07 - you don't have to compile
code to make it run,
07:09 - you can run it on the fly.
07:12 - So yes, overall it makes the speed
07:14 - of your code a little bit slower
07:16 - but there are packages that
can take your Python code,
07:18 - your particular Python code,
07:20 - and almost make it as fast as
a programming language like C.
07:24 - So its not like you're
really losing speed either.
07:27 - And other reasons is because its easier,
07:29 - it allows you as a developer
to be more effective
07:34 - and productive so you can
actually be doing a lot more
07:38 - with your time because
if you are learning,
07:41 - or you're doing something
with another language,
07:43 - sometimes a language
itself can slow you down,
07:46 - and you have to create lots
of things from scratch.
07:48 - For example, take something like C;
07:49 - you have to create almost
everything from scratch.
07:53 - It doesn't encourage you to use
a lot of existing libraries.
07:55 - So, it's good in its own way
07:58 - depending on the type of
projects you're doing.
08:01 - But for most of the other
things you're doing,
08:03 - whether it's web development,
front end development,
08:05 - back end development,
08:06 - you're doing regular software development,
08:08 - Python is really powerful
because it makes you
08:11 - much more effective and
productive at writing at code.
08:15 - You don't have to do
everything from scratch.
08:17 - You can leverage a lot
of the existing tools.
08:21 - Now, other reasons I mentioned
in many of my other videos,
08:24 - but if you're new to the
channel, first of all,
08:25 - I just wanna say thank you for being here.
08:27 - Consider subscribing.
08:28 - There's a lot of tools, tips and tricks,
08:30 - motivational stuff, negotiation stuff,
08:32 - everything to help you
become a better developer,
08:35 - land a job and be on your path
08:37 - to become a six-figure developer.
08:38 - Now with that said, let me continue.
08:40 - So, those are other reasons,
but in my other videos,
08:43 - what I have said a lot is that
08:45 - lots of companies are using it as well.
08:48 - So, you wanna see what companies
08:49 - are using your programming
language and how popular it is.
08:52 - For example, there programming languages
08:55 - that are not used a lot.
08:56 - Scheme is not used that much.
08:58 - PHP is an ugly language and
most people are kinda going away
09:03 - from it even though a big
part of the world is doing it,
09:06 - but the scope of it in the
future is not looking that great.
09:10 - Then you have other
languages which are smaller
09:12 - and hot and upcoming but
you look at something
09:14 - that has data in the past and
has a higher upward trend.
09:18 - Python has that, and Python is used.
09:21 - Google is mainly developed by Python.
09:25 - Sergey Brin says, "Python
where we can, C where we must."
09:30 - So the founder of Google says that.
09:33 - He's trying to use
Python wherever they can
09:35 - and then C where they must.
09:36 - So that should tell you that
its an awesome language.
09:39 - Google is using it, Instagram
is built mainly off of Python,
09:44 - Quora is is built off of Python,
09:46 - Dropbox is built off of Python, Hipmunk,
09:50 - and the list continues to go on.
09:52 - But my point with telling
you these things is that,
09:54 - look, big companies are using it,
09:57 - the predictions in terms of
what's gonna be happening
09:59 - in the future with programming
10:01 - and how programming is gonna
be taking over lots of jobs
10:03 - and things are gonna
be moving more and more
10:05 - to web development and data
science and machine learning
10:08 - and all of that, Python is predisposed
10:11 - to be powerful in that
and is becoming the norm
10:14 - for all of those.
10:15 - So that's gonna give you a bigger trend.
10:17 - In 2018, it was Google'd
more than Kim Kardasian,
10:20 - I should also tell you its pretty popular.
10:22 - With all, and Python programming,
10:24 - we're not talking about python snake.
10:26 - So if you take all of
these things into account,
10:29 - what you get is a powerful language
10:32 - that will give you job stability,
10:33 - which gives you a strong future,
10:36 - which makes sure none
of your time is wasted
10:38 - into actually learning it,
Which puts you in a place
10:41 - where you can potentially
be earning a high income,
10:43 - let's say in a few years,
10:45 - and you can even get on your path
10:47 - to making six figures or more.
10:48 - Again, that depends on
what your overall goal is.
10:51 - It gives you opportunities
to work as a freelancer,
10:54 - a consultant, a full-time developer;
10:56 - its a language that has all
those options open for you.
11:00 - And if go deep into it and
work on just problem solving
11:04 - and becoming a better developer,
11:05 - the future for you is
very, very, very bright.
11:09 - Now, you can be in any language.
11:11 - The most important things
are to understand concepts.
11:13 - I get that, but I want
you to pick something
11:16 - and work on a language
where you're not worrying
11:18 - about the syntax so much.
11:20 - You can just do what you
came here to fucking do,
11:24 - build projects, build real
world practical applications
11:27 - as fast as humanly possible,
be as effective, productive,
11:31 - and efficient as fast as possible.
11:33 - And the computer and programming,
11:36 - its like a genie on your side.
11:37 - You have infinite power.
11:39 - If you tell the computer
what to do it will do it,
11:42 - but you need a tool to
be able to speak to it.
11:44 - So it's like genie with infinite powers,
11:47 - but the only way to speak to it
11:49 - is though programming language.
11:50 - Why not pick a language that's the easiest
11:53 - to speak to the computer
with instead of a language
11:55 - that's really hard.
11:56 - Like, you can speak to people in Mandarin
11:59 - or you can speak to people
in Spanish, or English,
12:02 - or some other language in real life.
12:04 - You wanna start off with
the easier language,
12:06 - then maybe learn Mandarin, right,
12:08 - 'cause Mandarin is gonna be a lot harder.
12:10 - So, similarly, when it comes
to programming and development,
12:14 - learn to express your
thoughts, emotions, feelings,
12:17 - real world applications and all that
12:18 - through a programming
language that's easier
12:21 - and has an amazing future.
12:23 - And then, if you wanna branch out
12:25 - and learn some other stuff, go for it.
12:27 - That's gonna be awesome.
12:30 - That's what I wanted to share with you.
12:31 - Thank you so much for watching.
12:32 - As always, I love you face
12:34 - and I'll see you in the next video.
12:37 - I have an incredible video
that I want you to go and see
12:40 - that I've put together, okay?
12:40 - This video is unbelievable.
12:42 - This video will show you how
I went from being a dumb,
12:45 - broke Oaktan Community College student,
12:47 - to making $104,000 a year as a developer.
12:50 - What would it mean for you
12:51 - if you made your first $1,000 from coding?
12:55 - What would it mean for
you if I reveal to you
12:57 - my step-by-step system that I used to go
13:01 - from completely broke to
then learning how to code
13:05 - in just a few months, landing
my contract as a freelancer
13:10 - with Python and being able to make $20,000
13:13 - while I was a terrible Oakton
Community College student.
13:17 - And to then being able to
live the lifestyle I want
13:20 - on my own terms and have the
ability to have my own time,
13:24 - freedom, money, and have the
ability to make an impact
13:27 - on the world.
13:28 - And at the same time,
travel with my friends,
13:30 - be there for my family when
we hit 300,000 subscribers,
13:33 - go to all these events,
even now I'm in Miami,
13:36 - 10X Growth con with Grant Cardone.
13:39 - How does that lifestyle come about?
13:41 - As a Python developer,
13:43 - I was able to create that
lifestyle for myself.
13:45 - And in this video I wanna show you the,
13:47 - how you can do that for yourself.
13:49 - Take students like, for
example John Navarro,
13:52 - who went from working
with me from complete zero
13:54 - to becoming a senior data scientist.
13:57 - Or Nazar Mally, who
landed $130,000 contract
14:01 - and now he is moved to
Germany with his family
14:03 - and living an amazing life.
14:04 - Or Afrin Shaik who was
able to make $20,000
14:08 - after she took one of our programs.
14:10 - But before we continue,
I do wanna talk about
14:13 - the opportunity that exists
in 2019 and moving forward
14:17 - as a Python developer.
14:19 - So please go watch this video.
14:21 - Its an epic video I've put together,
14:23 - click on the link below
in the description,
14:26 - and its gonna take you to it.
14:27 - With that said, thank
you so much for watching.
14:29 - As always, I love your face
14:30 - and I'll see you in that other video.
14:32 - So go click there. I'll
see you right there.
14:34 - Click there. Do it.
14:36 - Do it, do it, do it.
14:42 - (upbeat bouncy music)

Cleaned transcript:

Hey you, I am coming to you live from Miami Beach. In this video I'm gonna talk about why you should learn Python programming in 2019. And thank you, somebody gave me actually help even with that title as well 'cause that's not one of my strengths. But what I do wanna talk about is why that's gonna be so important and I wanna talk about a few predictions into the upcoming years. So a little about it is job opportunity, like overall, why you should actually give a shit, the big reason, and then we can talk about some the nerdy reasons why Python is cool. That's the part where I get excited about. Why learn Python? Without any further ado, let's jump right into it. Why learn Python? Well, what I want to talk about is why learn programming first of all in general. You wanna be able to have more job security, you wanna have a job that most of the world is gonna be moving towards, but more importantly, you wanna do something that's exciting, you wanna build or create something from your head and get paid for it. Those are the reasons why I like programming in general. But if you look at Forbes, I was reading something on Forbes and it said, by the time its 2030, 800 million jobs will actually be taken over by AI. For example, your Uber or your Lyft and all these things that self checkout services. All of these things are gonna be done by something with AI and probably not gonna have drivers or people at the cash registry. So what that means is the worlds gonna be moving to people who can actually program and create those things. So the job opportunity for people who are programming will be improving in the upcoming years and the upcoming decades, all right? So that's gonna be one exciting part. Now, why Python specifically, well because most of this is gonna require data science, machine learning, and Python is actually one of the best languages for that, and it's becoming hotter and hotter for those reasons. So its becoming the most common than norm for when it comes to data science, machine learning, what have you. That's gonna a skills sets that's gonna be tougher for you to learn but if you learn it, you're gonna be pretty much unstoppable in the upcoming years. So that's one huge reason I mentioned Python. Other reasons why I mentioned Python, I mentioned it in lots of my other videos like Top Four Programming Languages to Learn First or Top Five Programming Languages to Learn First, but the reason I mention Python so much is because its ease of use, how close it is to reading like English, the writing is a lot easier and its just lots of things, just work common scenically. For example, if you're doing something in C, C++, you gotta tell the freaking thing what type, what data type you expect this function to return.

This is something Bob Proctor talks about which I love, and he said, "Three things will determine your income. "One is the demand for what it is that you do, "second is how good you are at that thing, "and third, which is actually one of the most important, the third thing is, how hard is it to replace you? So Python, there's huge demand. If you take the time and become good at it, that's gonna be amazing, right? If you can take the time to become good at it. And number three, if you become so good that its really hard to replace you or you're doing something so difficult that its really hard to replace you, you're automatically gonna be at a point where you can demand a much higher income without being irreplaceable. So those are a lot of the reasons why I love Python. Now, some of the more technical reasons are that its a very well developed language with an amazing community. So for a lot of things, you can go on GitHub and you can look up these projects that are already completed, and there's a big community support, so you can actually just use a lot of those libraries to make things work for yourself and most of it is really straightforward. Most of the stuff you can just do pip install and install these new packages, you can bring in new libraries into your own code and be able to work on these much bigger projects without running into even installation problems. Then other nerdy reasons that are good is that you don't have to compile code to make it run, you can run it on the fly. So yes, overall it makes the speed of your code a little bit slower but there are packages that can take your Python code, your particular Python code, and almost make it as fast as a programming language like C. So its not like you're really losing speed either. And other reasons is because its easier, it allows you as a developer to be more effective and productive so you can actually be doing a lot more with your time because if you are learning, or you're doing something with another language, sometimes a language itself can slow you down, and you have to create lots of things from scratch. For example, take something like C; you have to create almost everything from scratch. It doesn't encourage you to use a lot of existing libraries. So, it's good in its own way depending on the type of projects you're doing. But for most of the other things you're doing, whether it's web development, front end development, back end development, you're doing regular software development, Python is really powerful because it makes you much more effective and productive at writing at code. You don't have to do everything from scratch. You can leverage a lot of the existing tools. Now, other reasons I mentioned in many of my other videos, but if you're new to the channel, first of all, I just wanna say thank you for being here. Consider subscribing. There's a lot of tools, tips and tricks, motivational stuff, negotiation stuff, everything to help you become a better developer, land a job and be on your path to become a sixfigure developer. Now with that said, let me continue. So, those are other reasons, but in my other videos, what I have said a lot is that lots of companies are using it as well. So, you wanna see what companies are using your programming language and how popular it is. For example, there programming languages that are not used a lot. Scheme is not used that much. PHP is an ugly language and most people are kinda going away from it even though a big part of the world is doing it, but the scope of it in the future is not looking that great. Then you have other languages which are smaller and hot and upcoming but you look at something that has data in the past and has a higher upward trend. Python has that, and Python is used. Google is mainly developed by Python. Sergey Brin says, "Python where we can, C where we must." So the founder of Google says that. He's trying to use Python wherever they can and then C where they must. So that should tell you that its an awesome language. Google is using it, Instagram is built mainly off of Python, Quora is is built off of Python, Dropbox is built off of Python, Hipmunk, and the list continues to go on. But my point with telling you these things is that, look, big companies are using it, the predictions in terms of what's gonna be happening in the future with programming and how programming is gonna be taking over lots of jobs and things are gonna be moving more and more to web development and data science and machine learning and all of that, Python is predisposed to be powerful in that and is becoming the norm for all of those. So that's gonna give you a bigger trend. In 2018, it was Google'd more than Kim Kardasian, I should also tell you its pretty popular. With all, and Python programming, we're not talking about python snake. So if you take all of these things into account, what you get is a powerful language that will give you job stability, which gives you a strong future, which makes sure none of your time is wasted into actually learning it, Which puts you in a place where you can potentially be earning a high income, let's say in a few years, and you can even get on your path to making six figures or more. Again, that depends on what your overall goal is. It gives you opportunities to work as a freelancer, a consultant, a fulltime developer; its a language that has all those options open for you. And if go deep into it and work on just problem solving and becoming a better developer, the future for you is very, very, very bright. Now, you can be in any language. The most important things are to understand concepts. I get that, but I want you to pick something and work on a language where you're not worrying about the syntax so much. You can just do what you came here to fucking do, build projects, build real world practical applications as fast as humanly possible, be as effective, productive, and efficient as fast as possible. And the computer and programming, its like a genie on your side. You have infinite power. If you tell the computer what to do it will do it, but you need a tool to be able to speak to it. So it's like genie with infinite powers, but the only way to speak to it is though programming language. Why not pick a language that's the easiest to speak to the computer with instead of a language that's really hard. Like, you can speak to people in Mandarin or you can speak to people in Spanish, or English, or some other language in real life. You wanna start off with the easier language, then maybe learn Mandarin, right, 'cause Mandarin is gonna be a lot harder. So, similarly, when it comes to programming and development, learn to express your thoughts, emotions, feelings, real world applications and all that through a programming language that's easier and has an amazing future. And then, if you wanna branch out and learn some other stuff, go for it. That's gonna be awesome. That's what I wanted to share with you. Thank you so much for watching. As always, I love you face and I'll see you in the next video. I have an incredible video that I want you to go and see that I've put together, okay? This video is unbelievable. This video will show you how I went from being a dumb, broke Oaktan Community College student, to making $104,000 a year as a developer. What would it mean for you if you made your first $1,000 from coding? What would it mean for you if I reveal to you my stepbystep system that I used to go from completely broke to then learning how to code in just a few months, landing my contract as a freelancer with Python and being able to make $20,000 while I was a terrible Oakton Community College student. And to then being able to live the lifestyle I want on my own terms and have the ability to have my own time, freedom, money, and have the ability to make an impact on the world. And at the same time, travel with my friends, be there for my family when we hit 300,000 subscribers, go to all these events, even now I'm in Miami, 10X Growth con with Grant Cardone. How does that lifestyle come about? As a Python developer, I was able to create that lifestyle for myself. And in this video I wanna show you the, how you can do that for yourself. Take students like, for example John Navarro, who went from working with me from complete zero to becoming a senior data scientist. Or Nazar Mally, who landed $130,000 contract and now he is moved to Germany with his family and living an amazing life. Or Afrin Shaik who was able to make $20,000 after she took one of our programs. But before we continue, I do wanna talk about the opportunity that exists in 2019 and moving forward as a Python developer. So please go watch this video. Its an epic video I've put together, click on the link below in the description, and its gonna take you to it. With that said, thank you so much for watching. As always, I love your face and I'll see you in that other video. So go click there. I'll see you right there. Click there. Do it. Do it, do it, do it. (upbeat bouncy music)
