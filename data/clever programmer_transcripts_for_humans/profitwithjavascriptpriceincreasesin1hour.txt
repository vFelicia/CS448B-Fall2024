04:56 - difference between
04:58 - [Music]
05:03 - all right let me actually remove this
05:05 - comment here
05:08 - right there all right and i will pop up
05:11 - my
05:12 - this is my instagram by the way guys so
05:14 - you guys can hit me up right here
05:16 - all right i'm looking here guys question
05:18 - welcome zachary he says my dudes
05:21 - we got noob master rashav rashaf says
05:23 - what's the difference
05:24 - there in the pwg course now than it was
05:26 - before
05:28 - so that's a good question so
05:32 - what we're going to be doing with pwj is
05:33 - we're going to be adding ton of projects
05:35 - and going deeper into them so these were
05:37 - some of the projects
05:38 - you guys saw us put on
05:41 - youtube but in our profit with
05:43 - javascript course we're going to be
05:44 - going
05:45 - more deep into them and we want to be
05:49 - even covering things like
05:50 - typescript and more of the backend
05:53 - functionality right so for example the
05:55 - amazon project that we have on youtube
05:57 - is pretty good
05:58 - but mostly it's the front end
06:01 - in our course we're gonna put the entire
06:03 - backend with cloud functions
06:05 - and server less architecture and the
06:08 - whole nine and it'll be able to accept
06:10 - credit card payments and have stripe
06:12 - functionality and all of that so
06:16 - that's really the point we just go
06:18 - deeper in the profitable javascript
06:20 - program
06:21 - what's up bro how you doing what's up
06:23 - nice shirt nice shirt
06:25 - uh what's up guys we got about 208
06:28 - viewers
06:28 - that is very nice so these are all the
06:31 - technologies we would be covering right
06:33 - javascript
06:34 - react node [ __ ] express redux
06:37 - next and the list goes on
06:41 - and you know you guys got some nice
06:43 - javascript instructors but i want to
06:44 - take on your guys's questions i don't
06:45 - want to just go over what's on the page
06:47 - i mean you guys can read it
06:48 - it's in the description so let's see
06:50 - what questions you guys got
06:53 - what math should i focus on
06:56 - this course so come on in
06:59 - us so for this course
07:03 - you guys don't really need i'll try to
07:05 - put this here
07:07 - you guys don't really need to be live
07:11 - and available
07:11 - just it's a pre-recorded course so you
07:14 - can take it at your own pace
07:16 - you're welcome to take at your own pace
07:19 - the live coaching calls that's what you
07:21 - have to be there live for
07:22 - three of those happen one is with nas
07:25 - one is with sunny and then i think one
07:27 - of them is with success coaches but
07:30 - you know we also record those so if
07:32 - you're not able to make
07:34 - it to them you're able to watch them but
07:38 - we also so we also recently just added
07:40 - another
07:41 - coaching call we said another coaching
07:43 - call where basically guys
07:46 - we review your resumes so every saturday
07:49 - we review your resume so we have
07:51 - literally people from pwj
07:53 - they come in they send us their resume
07:56 - they sent us their resume right and then
07:59 - from that we go ahead
08:00 - me daniel or sonny we together we look
08:03 - at your resume we tell you what you need
08:04 - to improve
08:05 - hey
08:06 - [Music]
08:11 - all right that's what happens by the way
08:13 - every single time a
08:14 - a student joins profit with javascript i
08:16 - have a nice ringtone by dj khaled and he
08:18 - says another one and another one
08:20 - oh we can't do it
08:26 - it's we're pumped guys so everyone's
08:29 - saying
08:29 - every single time a student joins shout
08:32 - out to
08:33 - barticus weber he just joined prophet
08:39 - right javascript and then we also got
08:41 - harsh just joined profit with javascript
08:43 - welcome welcome
08:44 - yeah yeah but what i was going on is we
08:47 - now do coaching calls and resumes so
08:49 - you bring your resume and we tell you we
08:50 - need to improve and we literally even
08:52 - at a lot of the times we will write it
08:55 - for you we write parts of it for you
08:57 - so you can see a great example of how a
08:59 - resume should be like
09:01 - when you're trying to get jobs at
09:03 - companies and so forth
09:05 - and that has been amazing and so helpful
09:08 - for the students
09:16 - all right i'm looking for questions
09:19 - how much time does it take to learn
09:21 - react
09:23 - um honestly
09:26 - look at that just keep going
09:30 - let's go hey so
09:33 - for react guys it takes um
09:37 - i would say you know i if you join the
09:40 - course profit with javascript
09:42 - try to put in between 10 to 40 hours per
09:46 - week
09:46 - those are those that's the number where
09:49 - we see students getting good results
09:52 - and success with the program because
09:55 - oftentimes people think it's some kind
09:57 - of magic pill
10:00 - and it and it isn't um
10:03 - it requires you know a lot of work
10:07 - a lot of hard work and a lot of our
10:09 - students go through
10:10 - they keep trying like our best students
10:13 - will keep trying a lot of things
10:14 - they'll keep failing they'll show up to
10:18 - the live coaching calls
10:20 - hey welcome welcome
10:25 - who is it who joined one second let's
10:28 - see who joined just now
10:31 - wait but bartacus has already joined so
10:33 - why did it play again
10:37 - i don't know maybe you just played for
10:38 - him twice
10:40 - or maybe if you don't look at it it will
10:42 - play it at the second time oh
10:44 - yeah okay so yeah you guys
10:47 - can um 10 to 40 hours right not a magic
10:51 - pill you're gonna have to put in a lot
10:53 - of like hard work
10:55 - and a lot of our best students they fail
10:57 - many many many times but they keep going
11:00 - they come back
11:01 - to the community they come to the live
11:03 - coaching calls
11:05 - they fail again then they try again and
11:07 - it's just a cycle
11:09 - of error correction and very
11:12 - what seems like very slow and
11:13 - frustrating improvement but they just
11:15 - never
11:15 - quit they just keep showing up again and
11:17 - again and again
11:19 - and then they end up getting the results
11:20 - and it's most of the times for
11:22 - if you're committed it's not a matter of
11:24 - if it's often a matter of when
11:29 - sure how much can i make as a freelancer
11:32 - if i complete the course
11:34 - um if you really apply a lot of the
11:38 - things that we show you in the course i
11:39 - mean you should be
11:41 - it really depends on you right like we
11:44 - have students like lem
11:45 - kennedy who for example made um he made
11:48 - fifteen hundred dollars in his first
11:49 - three weeks in the program
11:51 - we have students like michael lecomp
11:52 - that cleared about six or seven thousand
11:55 - dollars in their first
11:56 - two months or three months of the
11:57 - program
12:00 - everybody is on a different pace now if
12:02 - you have you know somebody who's more
12:03 - advanced
12:04 - ryan noble who messaged me today and i
12:07 - keep telling him to get his ass on these
12:09 - calls
12:11 - and he never does because he's busy
12:14 - bro yeah so
12:17 - he's busy killing it and maybe i yeah so
12:20 - here here is here's ryan right
12:27 - so this guy messaged me and i was like
12:30 - yo i just ordered
12:31 - a mac pro and i gave him some tips and
12:33 - then he's like
12:35 - blah blah and then i replied to him i'm
12:37 - in blue right there and i said
12:39 - epic yo going live in an hour hour would
12:41 - mean the world if you could hop on and
12:43 - he goes lol if we can figure out a good
12:45 - time
12:48 - he goes i don't mind at all
12:54 - but he goes it's my mom's birthday and
12:56 - i'll record a video for you
12:59 - so this guy ryan noble he
13:03 - is one of the students that's more
13:06 - advanced
13:06 - and he's doing about twenty eight
13:08 - thousand dollars to forty thousand
13:10 - dollars
13:10 - per month on upwork so he's like
13:14 - really really crushing it and another
13:15 - level
13:17 - and so every student is going to be on
13:19 - at their own
13:20 - pace and going to be doing their own
13:23 - things
13:27 - for you like i can't i can't control you
13:30 - like we can't control you put in the
13:32 - work as
13:32 - much as ryan is right we can give you
13:35 - the guidance and we can give you the
13:36 - strategy
13:37 - and we can go here are all the tools for
13:40 - you to go and succeed
13:41 - and then it's really up to you how you
13:43 - actually put them to use and leverage
13:45 - them and how
13:46 - many hours and how much effort can you
13:48 - put in ryan was putting in
13:50 - you know probably 30 to 40 hours or more
13:53 - per week
13:54 - when i was coding and i got results and
13:56 - i got my first job
13:58 - you know within the first three to four
14:00 - months i was
14:01 - coding for 15 to 16 hours
14:05 - every single day so you know in my three
14:09 - months
14:10 - i covered as much coding experience as
14:13 - somebody would
14:14 - with one or two years of experience just
14:17 - because i put in as many hours as
14:19 - they would
14:25 - mish t mistake says is this one time
14:28 - payment method or can i pay
14:30 - on installment so we have a three-month
14:32 - payment plan
14:33 - if you want to take that you can also
14:35 - use a three-month payment plan
14:42 - here oh
14:45 - [Music]
14:47 - what's up in my alarms
14:55 - oh you guys can hear me now right yeah
14:57 - you guys can yeah
14:59 - that's really that's real make sure you
15:00 - get close and make sure it's like picks
15:02 - you up a lot yeah
15:03 - yeah they can hear me right now yeah i
15:05 - think should be fine
15:07 - what's up guys how you guys doing
15:11 - so good to see all of your amazing yeah
15:14 - what's up raha
15:15 - how you doing raha sanath
15:18 - hello hello we've got
15:23 - like george's question right there you
15:25 - see that
15:26 - george says as a person with very little
15:28 - experience
15:30 - in programming how many months would it
15:31 - take to get a job if i started studying
15:34 - every day
15:35 - um you can be very realistically looking
15:38 - at a job between
15:40 - the three month to six month mark so
15:43 - yeah if we and you can talk about this
15:47 - two nods but essentially
15:48 - where's my handy little app
15:53 - there we go all right so
15:56 - hopefully you guys can see this but
16:01 - if you're here george and right now like
16:03 - you're there's zero experience
16:05 - zero months of experience this is let's
16:07 - say three months of experience
16:10 - what is this all right and then let's
16:13 - say that this is like six months here
16:15 - right
16:17 - if you spend a lot of your time
16:20 - here and you make sure that you
16:24 - master the basics
16:29 - in the first month and then from month
16:32 - one to three
16:33 - so for those next two months you just
16:35 - build
16:36 - projects
16:42 - and i'm talking about the projects that
16:44 - you know
16:45 - that we show you in this program uh
16:48 - so of that caliber even if you don't
16:50 - join the program if you just build
16:51 - projects of the caliber of like a
16:53 - spotify clone or airbnb
16:55 - or hulu or netflix or tinder or tick
16:58 - tock
16:59 - or any of those that we show you how to
17:01 - build if you do that in the first three
17:03 - months
17:06 - then just for the next three months from
17:08 - the month three to month six
17:14 - simply just focus on actually trying to
17:17 - apply for a job
17:21 - and that should be pretty good
17:24 - yeah but i would also add to that i
17:26 - would also added that really quickly
17:28 - really depends on kind of a job you're
17:29 - trying to apply for like what you're
17:31 - talking about here is like a full-time
17:33 - job or a potentially freelancing job
17:35 - right
17:35 - mm-hmm but we have a lot of students for
17:37 - example like i mean
17:39 - yeah or a lot of students who came in
17:42 - with
17:42 - pretty much zero experience and one of
17:45 - the things they started doing guys
17:47 - is they started they learned a little
17:49 - bit they were going for
17:50 - they probably pretty much probably took
17:51 - about a month or so to learn
17:53 - and then what they did is they started
17:55 - coaching others who had zero experience
17:57 - right
17:57 - right and that to them was work right
18:00 - that's yeah that was their first kind of
18:01 - game-changing
18:02 - that was their first monetary value they
18:06 - got from what they learned
18:07 - right so even though you probably might
18:09 - not be making as much as i get a
18:11 - full-time job
18:12 - but right but by coaching
18:16 - number one number one listen closely you
18:19 - will
18:20 - you will earn money number two
18:23 - you will also learn more skills
18:26 - you will learn even more because by
18:29 - teaching
18:30 - you are also learning that's that's
18:33 - another
18:33 - thing that's also very important to kind
18:35 - of point out
18:37 - you know right
18:45 - those skills are important those skills
18:48 - are really important
18:50 - and it says nas not audible and sound of
18:53 - gnaws is
18:54 - fluctuating oh there we go now it's good
18:57 - were you muted yeah i was damn it oh
19:00 - [ __ ] all this time that i was talking
19:02 - talk talk again yeah so what i was
19:04 - talking about guys is
19:06 - what kazi was talking about is that the
19:08 - zero to three months from three to three
19:10 - to six months
19:11 - that kind of gets you to that gets you
19:14 - to a full-time job or a freelancing job
19:16 - but a lot of times what we have when
19:19 - when students come into our program
19:21 - for example like a model isn't a great
19:22 - example yeah right
19:24 - um they come into a program they take
19:26 - the first month
19:27 - to learn right the skills those basic
19:30 - skills that that causes highlighting
19:31 - right now
19:32 - and then what they do is they teach
19:34 - other people who have
19:36 - zero experience or they have less
19:38 - experience than what they do
19:40 - so they coach and so what happens then
19:42 - is not only number one
19:44 - not only do they earn money right but
19:46 - number two
19:48 - they are also increasing their skills
19:50 - even higher
19:52 - right why because my friends
19:55 - by learning by teaching i'm sorry
19:59 - you are also learning because when you
20:02 - teach
20:02 - when you teach right you actually have
20:04 - to know your stuff so you'll
20:06 - you will have to be forced to really
20:08 - understand
20:09 - what is the full understanding of like
20:10 - for example right in react.js what are
20:13 - what is components or anything along
20:15 - the lines of like right getting deep
20:17 - down to
20:18 - the knowledge right and that's it
20:22 - yep all right so that should have been
20:26 - good i think they heard you
20:27 - there yeah they did um
20:34 - question if i am someone who's already
20:36 - gone through a
20:37 - boot camp can you tell me the advantage
20:41 - or
20:41 - differences benefits to relearn
20:46 - i think just as long as you just stay
20:48 - towards focusing on making real world
20:51 - projects and

23:10 - you jay asked a good question do you see
23:12 - that
23:12 - huh jay asked a question right there
23:16 - what's the question i have a learn to
23:18 - react react native
23:20 - created a whole tinder app with react
23:21 - native but i don't didn't know
23:24 - i don't know how to get a job i'm in my
23:26 - first year of college
23:29 - okay so
23:32 - what's what's stopping you i mean i
23:35 - don't know your
23:36 - situation but it seems like what's
23:37 - probably stopping you from getting a job
23:39 - is i just
23:40 - have a hunch that you haven't applied
23:43 - enough
23:46 - you know and i don't know how many call
23:48 - with calls with like recruiters you've
23:50 - gotten with or
23:51 - job applications you have sent out do
23:53 - let us know if you have tried that
23:55 - but yeah because if you've done those
23:58 - things i think i mean you should be able
24:00 - to get
24:00 - some kind of job or interview or
24:03 - something
24:04 - yeah i think like for example i'll give
24:06 - you guys an example for me
24:08 - and i had a good amount of experience
24:10 - for me
24:11 - i applied i'm not kidding to probably
24:14 - 50 50 jobs like like when i was
24:18 - like i caught on it yeah yeah 50 jobs
24:21 - i applied when i was trying to get my
24:22 - first kind of like the internship my
24:24 - foot in the door
24:24 - mm-hmm after the start-up company 50
24:27 - jobs guys
24:28 - 50 different resumes that's a lot of
24:31 - jobs
24:32 - yeah before i actually collected one
24:35 - yeah so if you haven't applied to 50
24:38 - jobs keep going yeah
24:43 - thank you so much appreciate it man
24:46 - murder stack or mean stack or django for
24:48 - web
24:51 - um oh
24:54 - myrn stack or mean stack or jingle for
24:56 - web he asked
24:57 - i think just pick one doesn't matter
25:00 - yeah
25:00 - like as long as you can do it like i
25:02 - think you as long as you just pick one
25:04 - and stick with it and build things
25:06 - you'll be fine
25:07 - because there's there like you can do i
25:09 - mean you can even do
25:10 - django with combine it with the react
25:14 - like you'll be fine yeah so it
25:18 - you're gonna be good just pick one and
25:20 - get good at it yo bojack how's it going
25:22 - man
25:23 - hey bulldog what's up man yeah
25:26 - probably put your gain up now because i
25:28 - see you and you never go to yellow which
25:30 - means you're probably just really how
25:32 - about now dude
25:33 - things better right there yeah there you
25:35 - go going to like yellow especially yeah
25:37 - yeah
25:37 - things should be good now
25:46 - well your profit syrup says um
25:51 - nas please tell us what's inside the
25:53 - course and then delicious
25:55 - where can i find the detailed syllabus
25:57 - of the course
25:58 - we have right there i think you you if
26:01 - you go
26:02 - to how about this let's send them here
26:07 - oh that's interesting okay so if you
26:10 - guys want to see
26:11 - a detailed like what's in the course
26:14 - go to this url with slash pwjs
26:18 - at the end of it so i dropped it in the
26:22 - chat
26:24 - go here and here you'll actually see
26:28 - a more detailed syllabus of the course
26:32 - meaning there's the modules right there
26:34 - this section
26:35 - is going to show you what's in the
26:37 - modules yeah
26:38 - but we have more modules coming up
26:42 - yeah without more modules coming up but
26:44 - here you can
26:45 - see so for example you'll start
26:49 - off with you know what's like we're
26:52 - gonna actually develop a personalized
26:54 - roadmap
26:54 - for you because i think this is a really
26:57 - important thing if you're starting as a
26:58 - developer which is
27:01 - do you what do you even want to do do
27:04 - you want to do
27:04 - freelancing do you want to do full time
27:08 - do you want to do part-time or do you
27:10 - want to maybe coach other people
27:12 - and a lot of that depends on your
27:14 - personality type
27:16 - for example if you have a more
27:19 - risk-averse personality type meaning you
27:22 - want to run away from risk
27:24 - you are probably designed to do more
27:28 - full-time work rather than freelancing
27:31 - work
27:32 - yeah but if you have a more risk
27:34 - tolerant personality
27:36 - then freelancing might be a better way
27:38 - to go for you because there's
27:40 - higher risk and higher reward
27:43 - and so in the program we even like
27:46 - actually
27:46 - help you identify your own personality
27:49 - type
27:50 - what kind of lifestyle you want to have
27:53 - how much money do you want to make and
27:55 - so the first module is all about that
27:57 - roadmap does that make sense guys now
28:02 - once we move past that and we help you
28:05 - develop your road map
28:06 - yo what's up logan he goes risk versus
28:09 - hey logan what's up man
28:11 - once we help you do that you know and
28:14 - guys
28:14 - so the program is designed with complete
28:17 - beginners in mind so if you are a
28:19 - complete beginner
28:20 - just know that we're going to be
28:22 - covering the javascript crash course so
28:24 - this is all the javascript basics that
28:26 - you need to know
28:27 - are going to be here after that
28:30 - we get into things like problem solving
28:34 - dom environment for javascript
28:38 - developers
28:38 - so this is where
28:42 - a lot of the stuff is going to be in one
28:44 - place for all of you guys
28:46 - which you know you might have trouble
28:47 - finding through just
28:49 - like random youtube tutorials because
28:51 - all of this stuff i think it helps when
28:52 - it's in one place so for example
28:55 - you know setting up your zsh terminal
28:58 - and setting up your environment
29:00 - well uh alfred so alfred is like this
29:05 - [ __ ] incredible productivity tool
29:07 - especially if you're using
29:08 - mac yeah it's like spotlight but on
29:11 - steroids
29:12 - yes exactly that we're gonna and we're
29:15 - gonna give you
29:16 - alternate um alternatives if you're
29:18 - using windows
29:19 - um spectacle this is a window management
29:21 - tool so for example like
29:23 - you know when i'm moving around how do i
29:25 - put this on half here or half here
29:28 - or make it bigger like this you know
29:29 - when i'm like coding how do i do this
29:31 - you guys have probably seen me do my
29:33 - window management a lot
29:35 - i'm using spectacle uh visual studio
29:38 - code
29:39 - so what are the exact extensions you
29:41 - need to use for example like prettier
29:44 - or es7 snippets so you can do the rfce
29:48 - hack
29:48 - and then your react component is like
29:50 - automatically completed
29:52 - brackets which is another extension in
29:54 - vs code which allows you to have the
29:56 - color matching at the end so when you're
29:58 - using javascript you know
30:00 - what's where something is starting and
30:02 - where it ends
30:04 - um i'll show you guys how to use vim
30:07 - so this is like a really powerful
30:11 - tool that most people don't use but if
30:14 - you actually learn it it just like
30:16 - supercharges you i love it
30:17 - it's like one of my favorite things to
30:19 - show you guys i'm okay with it i know i
30:22 - know kazuya likes it i'm i'm like i'm
30:24 - like okay you use it
30:25 - i sucked very rarely
30:29 - because kazuya know loves it so and i
30:31 - love it
30:33 - um and then things like dropler so
30:37 - you know if you are even trying to
30:39 - communicate with your team
30:41 - it's one of those tools that makes you
30:44 - so
30:45 - damn invaluable on a team so like for
30:48 - example if you want to work with your
30:50 - team on web development
30:51 - you're like hey this testimonial here
30:56 - should go down to the bottom right
30:59 - uh can we take this one and maybe center
31:03 - align it
31:05 - and instead write top five programming
31:09 - languages
31:12 - at the top boom so i'll do this
31:16 - now when i hit paste check it out right
31:19 - this is what's cool
31:21 - it's already a link so when i send it to
31:23 - my teammates
31:24 - on slack it'll automatically expand so
31:26 - if you're working on a team of
31:27 - developers guys
31:29 - this is very useful to be able to
31:31 - communicate like that does that make
31:32 - sense
31:35 - so tools like that all right let me go
31:39 - your modules
31:45 - all right and then of course stack
31:47 - overflow deeper into stack overflow and
31:49 - deeper into
31:50 - git and lots of hacks of course you're
31:53 - gonna build
31:53 - a bunch of mini projects projects like
31:56 - blackjack app
31:57 - or twitter clone google maps api
32:02 - with nas chandragashi
32:05 - arthur thanks so much for the donation
32:06 - my friend yeah yeah yeah
32:08 - 20 rupees i think yeah
32:12 - this chrome extension and how do you
32:14 - actually submit
32:15 - a chrome extension so that's another
32:17 - thing so them says the new landing page
32:19 - rocks yeah i agree
32:21 - thank you i want to send people here but
32:22 - then we they don't see our projects that
32:24 - we have
32:25 - no we don't this is now we know yeah
32:28 - yeah so that's the only thing about it
32:31 - yeah
32:32 - we'll be we'll probably update it at
32:33 - some point not at some point probably
32:34 - update it and actually
32:36 - test this one out i'm sure i i just you
32:39 - have to custom code it you know it just
32:41 - takes forever i know
32:43 - the custom code is not the best part
32:44 - guys yeah
32:46 - that that that says a lot like for
32:48 - example if you're if you
32:49 - if you have a client right and you're
32:51 - trying to build a project with them
32:53 - right
32:54 - the custom code is not always the best
32:55 - solution yeah
32:57 - all right i think that just shows there
32:58 - for example because like for example
32:59 - right this was
33:00 - built right we were the client right
33:02 - this was built for us yeah
33:03 - right and so and so now because it's
33:06 - custom coded
33:07 - like it's hard for us to change anything
33:09 - but yeah just a small tip right there
33:11 - exactly
33:12 - and guys the price of the program in
33:15 - one hour and 24 minutes exactly will go
33:19 - up to 6.97
33:21 - guys will never come down guys get it
33:24 - while
33:24 - it's there guys this price will never be
33:27 - like this
33:28 - again sachin sharma says hey qazi do you
33:31 - cover
33:32 - know it and react in these modules as
33:34 - well so

36:39 - questions
36:40 - i sent you i sent you a question when it
36:42 - was 397 back in jail
36:45 - i'll take your questions like actually
36:46 - but let me i'm going to
36:48 - read it out right now yeah so clear
36:50 - programmer so
36:52 - callofons asks what are the minimal
36:54 - skills for a junior developer
36:56 - and do you need to know design patterns
36:58 - and systems design
37:00 - what are the minimum skills for your
37:02 - junior developer
37:04 - minimum skills for a junior developer i
37:06 - feel like
37:07 - no some kind of full stack and be able
37:10 - to put together
37:11 - apps i think that would be pretty good
37:14 - yeah
37:14 - be able to do back end and front end you
37:17 - don't have to be
37:18 - like crazy high level with it you don't
37:20 - need to know like next js and server
37:23 - side rendering and all that stuff but i
37:24 - think if you can put together
37:26 - uh if you know uh backend front end if
37:29 - you know things like api
37:32 - um that's pretty good yeah i would say
37:36 - if you're someone who can take an idea
37:39 - um develop an idea and if you can go
37:42 - ahead and actually take that idea and
37:43 - develop that into a project
37:45 - so basically for example build a build a
37:47 - front end and build a back end
37:49 - um i will sell you i would i would say
37:51 - at this point you're pretty much a dream
37:53 - developer
37:54 - yeah you're dream developer then so
37:57 - that's
37:57 - so knowing the front end how to build up
38:00 - and but most importantly also
38:01 - knowing how to hey what's up beast rwa
38:05 - how's it going man um so
38:08 - knowing how to actually take a project
38:10 - and actually divide it up into small
38:11 - pieces
38:12 - and to actually start it because that's
38:13 - one of the things that a lot of
38:15 - newer newcomers have like issues
38:19 - with the newcomers um difficulties i'm
38:21 - trying to say
38:22 - yeah yeah but once you get kind of get
38:25 - past that that's when you're like okay
38:26 - you know what
38:27 - i got this hell yeah
38:31 - but then like even like what makes you
38:32 - like a like a scene developer like it's
38:34 - just like
38:35 - honestly it's so hard to exactly know
38:38 - yeah unless you sip big ass tea
38:42 - hey look at that uh
38:46 - huh uh donji's gonna get blocked in the
38:49 - chat oh yeah

39:20 - syntax text editor or
39:22 - so which text editor do i use personally
39:24 - i use visual studio code when it comes
39:27 - to react and within
39:31 - visual studio code i use vim
39:34 - on top of it so then i feel like i get
39:36 - best of the both worlds i get the visual
39:38 - studio code and all the modern world
39:40 - beautiful
39:41 - gui that i get with it the extensions
39:44 - along with vim you don't need to use vim

54:49 - tick tock or learning how to make like
54:51 - netflix
54:52 - you know like cool [ __ ] like that oh
54:54 - that was you guys
54:55 - hell yeah bro that was us oh damn who
54:57 - else a little bit ago i
54:59 - i totally forgot about that yeah hey
55:01 - youtube never forgets
55:02 - that's why the pop didn't you recommend
55:04 - it bro
55:06 - yeah it's been a minute i didn't know
55:07 - we're busy
55:09 - yeah so yeah so that's cool you so you
55:12 - did build those apps
55:14 - no no not build them but i thought your
55:16 - streams about those all right
55:18 - yeah are you gonna ever build them
55:21 - [Laughter]
55:23 - i mean you guys already did it so
55:26 - um do you have a question for us if
55:28 - you're talking about like um
55:31 - my apps that like replicate it maybe
55:34 - okay
55:34 - and do you have and do you have any
55:37 - question
55:38 - for us while we are here if we can
55:41 - provide you with any value in anything
55:45 - [Music]
55:46 - um
55:48 - how did you guys come up with the idea
55:49 - to copy those apps and then
55:52 - make them and then you know
55:55 - process like that okay that's a good
55:58 - question so yeah
55:58 - how did we come up with the idea to make
56:02 - those apps and then put them up on
56:04 - youtube right
56:05 - yeah basically okay so we wanted to do
56:09 - something where we were like okay
56:10 - we are making tons of like tutorials but
56:13 - like kind of nobody was watching them
56:14 - and we're like what the [ __ ] like
56:16 - we're just we're spending all this time
56:18 - but it's not even helping anybody
56:20 - so we thought what are some hot ideas
56:23 - that we could come up with where we
56:25 - could get a lot of people's attention
56:27 - but then at the same time bring them a
56:29 - lot of value
56:30 - so that's how sunny and i were
56:32 - brainstorming
56:33 - and we came up with the idea of what if
56:36 - we started making like
56:38 - apps like real world apps like things
56:41 - that everybody knows and like plays with
56:43 - like netflix and spotify and
56:45 - twitter and tick tock and tinder so
56:47 - we're like okay
56:49 - let's do that and that's essentially how
56:53 - we came up with the idea and then as
56:54 - soon as we started dropping them
56:56 - it just started like banging hard it was
56:59 - like
57:00 - people you know went from like us
57:01 - getting like 3 000 views on the channel
57:03 - to like
57:03 - hundred thousand people would be
57:04 - watching you know 300 000 we're like
57:06 - okay
57:07 - we're it's helping people and then
57:11 - especially when people started using it
57:12 - to get jobs that's when we got really
57:15 - hooked on it because we're like all
57:16 - right
57:16 - let's keep doing this and not stop
57:21 - oh that's pretty good yeah no um
57:32 - um recommendation in terms of what uh an
57:35 - app
57:36 - that you guys could do if you guys want
57:38 - oh okay
57:39 - you have a recommendation for us yeah um
57:42 - have you done uh discord
57:46 - or telegram no we have not done a
57:49 - discord or a telegram actually
57:51 - yeah i think uh the discord one would be
57:53 - really cool because that's like
57:55 - a lot more unique all right and a little
57:58 - bit different dude this is [ __ ] cool
58:00 - right he's like yo i got a request for
58:02 - you like that's cool like that makes me

58:05 - nice okay yeah there was one that i i
58:07 - used for
58:08 - uh my internship a couple years ago and
58:11 - i'm drawing a blank on it would be
58:12 - perfect for you guys because it's like a
58:14 - chatting app

70:37 - uh yeah i've been thinking of this of
70:40 - course to join
70:41 - for long actually like for a month or so
70:44 - but i was you know i was just thinking
70:47 - of uh
70:48 - looking for free stuff but i was not
70:52 - fully invested in that
70:53 - and this course seems nice you guys have
70:56 - looked familiar friendly
70:58 - all factors you know vision and i find
71:01 - this
71:02 - course you know under uh
71:06 - um underpriced and i just joined
71:10 - i lost my job basically and
71:13 - with the help i'm gonna make some money
71:16 - so you lost your job
71:17 - recently what was it that caused you to
71:20 - lose your job
71:23 - um because of this coronal lay down was
71:26 - uh layup was going on yeah and
71:34 - yeah i think a lot of people are even in
71:36 - the united states a ton of people in our
71:38 - community are like
71:39 - they're furloughed from their work or a
71:41 - bunch of them are let go
71:44 - so it's you know yeah i don't know if
71:46 - you were there for the live stream we
71:48 - did earlier today when we had jen on
71:51 - she they had to let go 25 junior
71:55 - developers
71:56 - um and she was making about 50 000 a
71:59 - year she was
72:00 - one of the people that was let go
72:02 - because of
72:03 - covet like layoffs and then
72:07 - about a week later she got a job offer
72:12 - for um ninety six thousand dollars
72:16 - in the program
72:19 - so uh i want to you know
72:22 - thank you for doing this uh like for
72:25 - people like us to
72:27 - learn your technology in such a
72:30 - quick and easy way and
72:33 - you guys are so entertaining also at the
72:36 - same time
72:36 - you sonny everyone
72:40 - yeah we try we try to just be
72:43 - um as entertaining as possible and just
72:45 - make it fun
72:46 - because a lot of people you know they
72:49 - don't
72:50 - do that and i always wish that i learned
72:53 - from a place where
72:54 - not only was i learning good and correct
72:57 - information but i also wanted it to be
73:02 - fun
73:05 - i really wish uh the program will become
73:08 - number one
73:09 - you know yeah coding channel
73:14 - that's the goal and you must be getting
73:16 - a lot of love from india yeah
73:18 - a lot of love from india we really
73:20 - appreciate that
73:24 - yeah seriously thank you so much for
73:26 - being on the call saurabh
73:27 - we really really appreciate you and we
73:30 - will see you
73:31 - on the coaching calls yes indeed yes
73:34 - indeed
73:35 - thank you thank you all right take care
73:37 - saurabh
73:38 - appreciate you
73:42 - all right that was epic
73:46 - teja says saurabh man 43 000 is a huge
73:49 - amount you've spent especially since
73:51 - now you have been furloughed
73:56 - yep it is a huge amount it's no
73:59 - small amount to be able to spend that
74:02 - but if you have a source that you trust
74:06 - if you don't trust the source right then
74:07 - of course like you're never going to
74:09 - spend
74:09 - but if you have a source that you trust
74:11 - and you also trust
74:12 - your self it's an investment because
74:15 - what other vehicle is there right like
74:18 - if you lose your job well then your
74:20 - income goes to zero
74:21 - and if you don't change something
74:24 - ain't nothing gonna change no so you
74:28 - have to
74:30 - change the way things are going and
74:31 - maybe sometimes it means like
74:33 - making an investment in yourself getting
74:35 - coaching or getting help
74:36 - from people who can actually help you
74:38 - get out of there
74:40 - and then boom you're on the right track
74:41 - again maybe you just need that little
74:43 - push that little right advice at the
74:45 - right time and then boom just go flying
74:46 - yeah and i think it's very important
74:49 - guys to understand that
74:50 - the coaching and then the investment
74:52 - that you're making to yourself
74:54 - in terms of knowledge-wise an investment
74:58 - where you go ahead you know either take
75:00 - lessons or you take coaching
75:02 - or you know you buy a course to increase
75:04 - your knowledge
75:05 - what you understand is knowledge will be
75:08 - there
75:09 - for the rest of your life right yeah
75:12 - so what you're learning is simply just
75:14 - going to be there with you to
75:15 - to to increase your value increase your
75:19 - self-worth
75:20 - and so much more than whatever that
75:22 - you're going to put in
75:24 - money-wise right now right you might be
75:27 - able to put in right now
75:29 - the cost of the program which is
75:30 - currently 5.97
75:33 - but the return on that after maybe
75:36 - even potentially a month or two it's
75:38 - gonna be twice that three times death
75:40 - four times that ten times that and it
75:42 - keeps going and going and going
75:44 - so just keep that always in your mind
75:47 - yep
75:48 - abhinav says it's a good opportunity for
75:50 - soro
75:51 - he can put his all his time and effort
75:54 - into this course and he will learn so
75:56 - much which is difficult with the job
75:59 - so in a way i would actually argue that
76:01 - that's good that this happened
76:03 - with saurabh because it actually just
76:06 - allows him to have
76:07 - full-time focus on improving his skill
76:10 - set
76:10 - so then the next job you get you should
76:14 - be looking sore up to get a job that'll
76:15 - pay you
76:17 - twice as much right just like jen she
76:19 - went from
76:20 - 40k after losing her job she was at i
76:23 - think 40 something k
76:25 - and then she went when she went back she
76:28 - got a 96k
76:30 - um job so i want you to be
76:34 - on a similar path where you get on a job
76:36 - and this is usd
76:37 - by the way right usd uh so
76:40 - i want you to in a similar path like
76:42 - that sort of
76:45 - somebody says can you make your paypal
76:47 - clone that would be interesting 40
76:48 - minutes by the way
76:50 - that would be interesting i think that
76:52 - would be sick agreed
76:54 - yeah ready dev says hey
76:58 - i saw your ig story about making a
77:00 - challenge we're learning about
77:02 - starting a youtube brand hell yeah we
77:03 - want that yeah so that was an
77:05 - interesting one
77:06 - i i think you heard me making a story
77:09 - and i was like guys
77:10 - if you would be interested in like kind
77:13 - of how we grew clever programmer as a
77:14 - personal brand

77:17 - in that i was thinking about doing a 10
77:19 - or like a 30 day challenge okay to tell
77:22 - people like exactly what
77:24 - videos to make exactly how to make them
77:27 - whether they have a budget

83:59 - [ __ ] oh
84:01 - nice what is that nano leaves now
84:05 - and i'm doing up an office next door so
84:08 - everything's gonna be nice dude
84:16 - it's not long enough right no
84:19 - logan says name a more famous jail sonny
84:21 - plus the tommy hilfiger hoodies
84:35 - i finished the airbnb spotify cover

84:38 - nice add that to your portfolio
84:42 - and have a awesome resume that is that's
84:44 - dope man
84:48 - okay tiffany y says i saw that pwg
84:50 - program projects are on
84:52 - youtube is a youtube or training course
84:54 - that is not available on youtube
84:55 - available exclusively in pwj
84:57 - so that's actually a really good
84:59 - question so think of it this way
85:00 - yes you get all the content that you get
85:02 - on youtube plus we pretty much go
85:04 - much further in depth plus if you don't
85:05 - know how to code we're going to teach
85:07 - you
85:07 - everything so all the fundamentals
85:09 - everything and on top of that we then go
85:11 - ahead and layer it with react
85:12 - and then add on the coaching course so
85:15 - coaching calls are pretty much going to
85:16 - be where you actually learn to
85:18 - make money with the skills so right now
85:20 - obviously we show you guys clones on
85:21 - youtube but we're not actually showing
85:22 - you really
85:23 - you know like the ins and outs because
85:25 - we're limited by time we're limited by
85:26 - those things but on the coaching calls
85:28 - we can go ahead and go
85:29 - really in depth and show you guys
85:32 - how to make money to land clients all
85:34 - that sort of stuff
85:35 - exactly and you know i said this earlier
85:38 - but imagine for example if on youtube we
85:40 - had
85:41 - the amazon clone but it's heavily
85:44 - focused towards the front end
85:46 - then in the course what we're gonna add
85:48 - for you is
85:49 - also back-end functionality meaning you
85:51 - can accept
85:53 - payments you can add cloud functions
85:56 - a server-less architecture to your app
85:58 - and actually have
85:59 - a scalable app that can do everything
86:03 - so we'll go deeper in the program
86:07 - gabriel graves goes headphone cord
86:09 - wasn't long enough yep that's the
86:10 - problem
86:12 - you two would be hugging that's
86:19 - nasa's headphone cord nas was asking me
86:23 - just come closer bro oh is that where
86:26 - you plug it in the front
86:27 - you could do that bro oh nice i'll just
86:28 - move the camera a little bit
86:34 - oh
86:37 - holy hell damn
86:40 - you want to get a smaller cord next time
86:44 - i control that i'm having a doubt is i
86:47 - saw this course before
86:48 - okay pro vfx if you've seen the course
86:50 - before and you've seen it now
86:51 - open again then we're going to go
86:53 - lightly because in a week
86:55 - we pretty much close the doors to the
86:56 - same course that you just you're talking
86:58 - about so
86:59 - um we choose to like very carefully
87:01 - decide when we open and close the doors
87:03 - but if you're on the fence right now
87:05 - literally 30 minutes to save yourself
87:07 - money so make sure you go ahead and jump
87:10 - in you can save yourself that deal
87:12 - yeah yeah next week we're actually
87:14 - closing the doors to the program so
87:17 - that's another another one
87:21 - all right now let's make sure your head
87:23 - is in the your phone came through right
87:28 - there oh [ __ ] oh look at that because
87:29 - otherwise you won't be
87:31 - being picked up yeah yeah it's a
87:34 - funny situation we got over here
87:40 - this isn't easy bro let's go complicated
87:44 - scratch i wish your record was longer
87:47 - i wish too
87:55 - i think you guys know why or left
87:58 - so mdrana says sorry to say that i can't
88:01 - see this live because i'm on a deadline
88:03 - to complete the amazon clone okay
88:05 - aj says before joining this course i
88:07 - just wanted to know whether you guys
88:08 - teach a system design also what do you
88:10 - what do you mean by system design also
88:14 - and what i would say from experience all
88:16 - that stuff that you'd learn like system
88:18 - design or like drawing out those
88:20 - what are they called uml diagrams and
88:22 - stuff like that you learn that in
88:23 - university and
88:24 - nobody uses that [ __ ] in real life like
88:26 - that's the truth like as in like
88:28 - well rarely ever you use that stuff i
88:30 - mean like you
88:31 - the best thing you'll get to is like a
88:33 - white boarding exercise where you pretty
88:35 - much have like a whiteboard and you just
88:36 - have a few developers around
88:38 - throwing out a plan like it really goes
88:40 - down to like
88:41 - what's going to get you from a to b
88:43 - regardless of all the fancy sort of
88:45 - stuff
88:45 - so that's my advice on that on the topic
88:48 - yeah
88:49 - yeah exactly
88:57 - charles says saw the ig store is there a
88:59 - limit for the coaching calls three
89:01 - months or more
89:01 - so the coaching calls how we're deciding
89:04 - to do them
89:04 - is if you join the program you kind of
89:08 - get unlimited coaching calls now
89:12 - we can't legally say that because
89:15 - i don't know like what if some of one of
89:18 - us something god forbid something
89:19 - happens to right because we're human
89:21 - beings
89:22 - but um yeah so you are going to get
89:25 - coaching calls
89:27 - again unless something that we haven't
89:29 - thought about happens
89:31 - that we hadn't predicted you're going to
89:33 - be getting coaching calls
89:34 - for the for the whole year if not more
89:38 - when you join the profit with javascript
89:40 - program and that's kind of what makes it
89:42 - a very ridiculous deal
89:43 - and it's three to four coaching calls a
89:45 - week
89:46 - what's also worth mentioning is you
89:48 - actually get all the coaching calls
89:50 - uh that have already happened as well so
89:52 - you'll get that as a recording
89:53 - yeah mm-hmm really literally going back
89:56 - to like
89:57 - months and months and months back to
89:58 - when it started
90:00 - yeah yeah harvard's in the house what's
90:04 - up
90:07 - that's fine that's fine oh okay it's
90:09 - fine all right
90:11 - we want to see they see they see enough
90:12 - of my face every single day all right
90:14 - i mean if you don't care about your face
90:16 - then i can just be more comfortable
90:26 - 27 minutes guys guys 27 minutes
90:34 - we go
90:38 - no nas domonsky
90:41 - logs trange without specs
90:45 - such
90:57 - google is offering job are you all
91:00 - serious
91:03 - krishna krishna asks i joined pwj if i
91:06 - work harder can i become
91:08 - a teacher to teach other success coaches
91:11 - as course says yeah if you
91:15 - you're not going to teach other success
91:16 - coaches i mean that's silly but you're
91:18 - going to teach
91:18 - like other people you know like you can
91:22 - teach people on
91:23 - yzant or you can put an ad on craigslist
91:26 - and you can be like
91:27 - hey i can build a to-do list app with
91:29 - react
91:30 - if you're a beginner i can teach you how
91:31 - to do that they will
91:33 - give you money and you will teach them
91:36 - how to do that or you will teach them
91:38 - how to do
91:38 - basic for loops variables functions
91:42 - arrays all that stuff to teach it to
91:46 - people and they will
91:46 - they will in exchange pay you exactly
91:49 - and we actually show you
91:50 - a lot of techniques as to how to do that
91:53 - um because a lot of us do coaching
91:56 - rajit says i joined pwj
91:59 - let's go yo let's go
92:04 - it's so funny we have al al nasheen says

93:55 - but right now it's at 243 payments you
93:58 - just click here
93:58 - join now and that's what will get you
94:00 - there
94:02 - exactly also guys a little tip actually
94:04 - if you want to
94:05 - sort of if you have paypal paypal for
94:08 - six month finance and the link
94:09 - link is in the description by the way
94:11 - just in case that wasn't clear
94:12 - or cleverprogrammer.com pwj but sonny
94:15 - what were you what were you saying
94:17 - no i was just going to say somebody
94:20 - somebody says nas is eating the mic
94:22 - but um yeah if you here we go
94:26 - if you uh if you have paper available in
94:28 - your area
94:29 - make sure you actually go ahead and take
94:30 - advantage of something called paypal
94:32 - credit is zero percent interest
94:33 - like finance option and you get six
94:35 - months spreading it
94:37 - so that's actually something without any
94:39 - interest by the way
94:40 - yeah without any interest vibe lovers
94:43 - says
94:44 - guys i literally don't have money to
94:47 - join now will the price
94:49 - be cut or will there be a discount for
94:51 - thanksgiving or
94:52 - christmas and the answer to that
94:56 - is that we know
94:59 - that if we undervalue the program on
95:02 - thanksgiving or christmas or black
95:05 - friday
95:06 - what happens is that's what people wait
95:09 - for
95:10 - then and that's actually what the value
95:13 - of the course is in people's eyes
95:15 - so we never want to tarnish the brand
95:18 - that profit with javascript
95:20 - is and how much effort it took us to
95:22 - make it what it is and
95:24 - give you guys a premium quality service
95:26 - so no unfortunately
95:28 - there will never be a lower price ever
95:31 - for this program
95:32 - than this and we are very carefully
95:34 - right we move it up like
95:36 - if you guys remember when we launched it
95:38 - was at 197 last year
95:40 - those who joined it got that deal and it
95:42 - was amazing
95:44 - then we moved it up to 297 then we moved
95:47 - it up to 397 and it was at 397 for a
95:50 - really long time
95:52 - then in the last month we moved it to
95:54 - 497
95:55 - and now it's at 597 and it's still a
95:58 - steal
95:59 - i think if you can get it for under 5
96:01 - 000
96:02 - i think it's a steal because most coding
96:05 - boot camps that are even worth
96:06 - 15 000 most students tell us that it is
96:10 - worth more than those fifteen thousand
96:12 - dollars
96:13 - boot camps so if you can get it for less
96:16 - than five thousand
96:17 - i think it's a steal and you should jump
96:20 - on it
96:21 - and you shouldn't flinch if you have any
96:23 - amount of
96:24 - seriousness that you think that your
96:26 - career is important
96:28 - i think you should jump on it and take
96:31 - the course
96:32 - yeah guys most boot camps are actually
96:35 - like three
96:36 - three thousand pounds in the uk or like
96:38 - upwards from three thousand pounds
96:40 - and they're very much like you don't get
96:42 - the one-on-one sort of aspect of it it's
96:44 - like a classroom
96:45 - yeah and yeah like you're not gonna be
96:48 - able to get like that personalized video
96:49 - feedback all of those extra things that
96:51 - we've kind of thrown in
96:52 - you know like i also saw john just
96:54 - joined welcome john
96:56 - well how are you seeing this this comes
96:58 - through on
96:59 - slack so i think the web hook fires off
97:01 - us
97:02 - got it oh i see md md islam just joined
97:07 - i seen that okay okay yeah mine was just
97:10 - like slower for some reason
97:12 - oh yeah yeah i just got that one nice oh
97:15 - and we got another one
97:16 - uh tiffany yang oh nice another one
97:22 - another one all right so yeah
97:26 - jon snow says
97:29 - i think it'll be better if you raise
97:30 - your camera a bit so i need to get a
97:32 - better view i don't exactly know what
97:34 - that means gabriel
97:35 - graves gabriel were you the person who
97:37 - was like
97:38 - telling other people to step it up he
97:41 - goes do you have
97:42 - many videos or plan in the future that
97:44 - use react as a friend
97:45 - and django as a back-end for api if not
97:49 - i'm going to invest
97:50 - in node.js or whatever you guys are
97:52 - teaching yeah i think we're going to be
97:53 - going no
97:54 - js route in this program yeah yep
97:58 - zachary asks by the way guys i'm
97:59 - currently doing game dev
98:01 - should i still join just for the
98:03 - community support mike is pulling
98:05 - through
98:06 - nasa's mic is pulling through but you
98:09 - can't hear him from
98:10 - skype okay yeah yeah yeah it's a bit
98:13 - complicated here
98:15 - yeah yeah i'm currently doing game dev
98:17 - should i still join
98:18 - just for the community support and
98:20 - motivation because the web dev isn't
98:22 - really my target anymore
98:24 - um should you join for for if you just
98:28 - did join for the support and the
98:30 - motivation and the community
98:31 - yeah it's up to you one more question i
98:33 - was out yes
98:35 - here's here's my answer to that it's
98:36 - really quick
98:38 - really quickly yes why and it's not just
98:41 - because we want you to join the course
98:43 - but maybe we do but like
98:44 - it's also because one of the most
98:46 - valuable things that you can have in
98:48 - any development guys is the network that
98:51 - you have around yourself
98:53 - so who knows you might be doing game dev
98:56 - right
98:57 - you might not be doing web dev but check
99:00 - this out maybe there's someone in the
99:01 - community
99:02 - who has or is doing a
99:06 - game damn or game development or has a
99:08 - company with game development
99:09 - or has an opportunity with game
99:11 - development next thing you know
99:13 - you you're connected you're contacted
99:16 - and then you've got a game development
99:17 - position
99:19 - so yeah it's not so much just web dev
99:21 - game it doesn't matter what kind of
99:23 - development you want to do
99:24 - the community will provide what you need
99:27 - yes there's a lot of unknown questions
99:29 - as well in coding like because in people
99:31 - might not have no idea where to begin
99:34 - where to start with in some kind of
99:36 - community at least you can
99:37 - get like a direction for that because
99:42 - out of those 2 000 members i get another
99:44 - one
99:46 - i'm a pop star i'm not a doctor
99:51 - hey i like that song in here bro i can

100:51 - i'm curious
100:52 - how what made you pull the trigger to
100:55 - join profit with javascript today
101:00 - uh well um in the past i had um
101:04 - i have got like um i started learning a
101:06 - bit of flutter
101:08 - and i've always been interested in
101:10 - making like um
101:12 - some applications like just having to
101:14 - code once
101:15 - yeah and maybe like make a website or
101:18 - something
101:18 - and like kevin like being able to use
101:21 - that code to like make an application as
101:23 - well
101:24 - and i've always been pretty interested
101:25 - in freelancing i tried freelancing one
101:28 - time and
101:29 - wasn't really successful at it yeah and
101:32 - during that time
101:34 - i was trying to build uh build uh
101:36 - applications natively
101:37 - so i had the code once in java then code
101:41 - the entire app again
101:43 - in uh swift so that was a bit of a
101:45 - hassle
101:46 - so and i um i saw react and that was
101:49 - pretty interesting
101:50 - how did you see react was it you came
101:53 - and watched um
101:55 - one of our like clones or builds we were
101:57 - doing
101:59 - um well i once since i started flutter
102:02 - um i had heard about react i heard that
102:05 - was kind of hard
102:06 - and i i did see that you got i did see
102:09 - you guys um
102:10 - doing something live and that was pretty
102:12 - interesting yep
102:13 - did you i mean when you say we i saw you
102:16 - guys are you talking about me
102:17 - and nas me and sonny who are you talking
102:19 - about

102:47 - um i really i'm really interested in the
102:48 - freelancing thing
102:50 - yeah nice dope man i'm trying to
102:53 - i'm trying to not make this song you're
102:56 - not you're trying not to what
102:58 - i try not to make this awkward oh no man
103:00 - you're totally fine
103:01 - i didn't know i was going to get a call
103:04 - yeah okay
103:05 - no surprise it's all good man
103:09 - the the person who needed to make it
103:11 - awkward already did it before he was
103:13 - vaibhav and we called him and he was
103:14 - like talking to us and they were like
103:16 - you're live on youtube like tell us why
103:18 - you joined prophet javascript then he's
103:19 - just like
103:20 - nothing silence i'm like i see we're on
103:23 - the call
103:24 - like it says 41 seconds on the call 42
103:28 - 42 44.
103:29 - i was like way above are you there and
103:31 - then he just like hung up after 20
103:32 - seconds i was like damn that was weird
103:35 - but you're fine yeah have um i have a
103:38 - spell into a rabbit hole
103:39 - just like trying to figure out which
103:42 - framework to use
103:44 - like uh which javascript framework yeah
103:47 - and
103:48 - i'm like an absolute move and i kind of
103:50 - just like got stuck
103:52 - yeah i shouldn't even be worried about
103:53 - that right now i should be worrying
103:55 - about
103:55 - learning the fundamentals first and then
103:57 - worry about that later yup
103:59 - that makes sense um
104:02 - yeah i think in this program just focus
104:06 - on learning the fundamentals and then
104:10 - building the projects
104:12 - if you do just those two things you will
104:14 - be in a re
104:15 - like in a better place than almost
104:17 - anybody else but it just requires a lot
104:19 - of like focus
104:20 - and discipline okay
104:23 - and you will have coaching calls with
104:25 - nas and sunny and these guys will
104:27 - help you build those projects along with
104:30 - what's inside the course
104:32 - and then step three for you you know
104:35 - step one being learn the basics and
104:36 - fundamentals step two build projects and
104:38 - step three just
104:39 - very simple we're gonna start helping
104:42 - you apply
104:43 - to jobs and then you're gonna land a job
104:47 - okay yeah exactly and we'll pretty much
104:50 - like in those coaching calls you can ask
104:52 - the question so the way you way i kind
104:54 - of say is like you go away you kind of
104:56 - work on the modules you build stuff out
104:58 - you figure out what works for you
105:00 - your sort of learning style and then on
105:01 - the coaching course it's very like
105:03 - critique based so like
105:04 - literally i kind of ask students like
105:06 - what's working for you what's not
105:07 - working for you
105:08 - we dive deep we go into like deep
105:10 - questions like if you wanna if everyone
105:12 - wants to land clients
105:13 - we'll go ahead and focus the entire core
105:15 - on how to land the client
105:16 - um or like how to land a student so all
105:19 - of that stuff
105:20 - make sure i'd say honestly if you could
105:21 - take something away from the course
105:23 - the main thing would be like take away
105:25 - the community and those coaching calls
105:27 - because
105:27 - the material you can always do at your
105:29 - own pace but you're going to get gold in

118:12 - live call with us today

118:44 - for you react
118:46 - native loads of stuff coming your way
118:48 - guys yeah in
118:49 - outside the course that's right
118:52 - so guys is there anything you want to
118:55 - say sunny
118:56 - to end it off with i want to say guys
119:00 - you guys are awesome and if you haven't
119:03 - already had a chance
119:05 - i mean see if the price i know a lot of
119:07 - people even when it did
119:08 - increase last time somehow they managed
119:10 - to get the old link yeah so uh
119:12 - and actually atarva actually joined that
119:14 - way so yeah make sure you guys go ahead
119:16 - and
119:16 - smart about it and like we said guys you
119:19 - cause
119:19 - the one thing i want to shout is cause
119:21 - he said you won't get your time back
119:23 - right
119:23 - that's the one thing that like you're
119:25 - just not gonna get back so
119:27 - rather than thinking as an investment in
119:29 - the course think of it as like investing
119:31 - your time somewhere
119:32 - important right so that's something
119:33 - which is which is going to change your
119:34 - life
119:35 - and it's the only way you can actually
119:36 - change your life so do something big
119:39 - do it today yep because what's the
119:42 - alternative
119:43 - yeah what is the alternative you spend
119:46 - worst case scenario you spend the 600
119:48 - investment 597
119:50 - investment and it doesn't turn out you
119:52 - tried
119:53 - right yeah but what happens on the other
119:55 - side if you spend 597
119:58 - and you can actually get a job that pays
120:00 - you between thirty thousand dollars or
120:02 - fifty thousand dollars or eighty
120:04 - thousand dollars or more per year
120:06 - that is where your win is at you should
120:09 - be like
120:10 - bullheadedly focus on the value that
120:13 - exists
120:14 - you can get out of it even when i was
120:16 - starting my business at clever
120:18 - programmer like
120:19 - i took debt to take a four thousand
120:22 - dollar course i used my credit card
120:24 - with debt to take a four thousand dollar
120:25 - course and it's not [ __ ] you can
120:27 - actually go to youtube and like actually
120:28 - go to 2017 and then drop the video in
120:31 - january which talks about me
120:33 - buying a 4 000 course and actually buy
120:36 - it live in the video
120:38 - and so it was an investment and i took a
120:40 - risk
120:41 - to grow clever programmer to have that
120:44 - vision and like
120:45 - just keep going if you invest in
120:48 - yourself
120:49 - it's rarely a thing that like it's a
120:51 - thing that can't be taken away from you
120:53 - it's not clothes it's not a car
120:55 - it's not something that somebody can
120:57 - strip away from you it's a skill that's
120:59 - there
121:00 - with you forever and money is just a
121:02 - lagging indicator of skill and value
121:05 - so if sonny knows the skill of react it
121:08 - doesn't matter what happens to him today
121:09 - or tomorrow if he loses his job
121:12 - he has the skill set to be able to get a
121:15 - job
121:15 - at any time any place and get a high
121:17 - paying job
121:19 - exactly guys and yeah i think the key
121:21 - one there is money
121:23 - the money is a lagging indicator like
121:24 - that's huge like it is so true guys
121:27 - focus on the skill
121:28 - build up that skill and then it really
121:29 - doesn't matter what position you're in
121:31 - covet covered
121:32 - or not like you can pretty much save
121:34 - yourself in any situation with that yeah
121:36 - yeah i think i think for me personally
121:39 - kind of what
121:40 - drives my decisions guys is what kazu
121:43 - said which is
121:45 - what is the alternative if you think
121:47 - about the alternative to
121:48 - buying this course is not buying and
121:51 - basically
121:52 - going the same path that you were going
121:54 - before
121:55 - that's the path of right being stuck in
121:58 - the youtube tutorial hell
121:59 - not knowing the road map not being able
122:02 - to get a job
122:03 - and not being able to get a freelancing
122:06 - gig or not have a community
122:08 - when i every time i ask myself this
122:10 - question and i get a bad answer
122:13 - because the alternative of not doing
122:14 - something i want to do
122:16 - it's like heck no i don't want to go
122:19 - that route i don't want to go the route
122:20 - of the scene that i've been going for
122:21 - the past
122:23 - months the past years what requires
122:26 - is a change and this can be your change
122:30 - that's it exactly with that said guys

right let me actually remove this comment here right there all right and i will pop up my this is my instagram by the way guys so you guys can hit me up right here all right i'm looking here guys question welcome zachary he says my dudes we got noob master rashav rashaf says what's the difference there in the pwg course now than it was before so that's a good question so what we're going to be doing with pwj is we're going to be adding ton of projects and going deeper into them so these were some of the projects you guys saw us put on youtube but in our profit with javascript course we're going to be going more deep into them and we want to be even covering things like typescript and more of the backend functionality right so for example the amazon project that we have on youtube is pretty good but mostly it's the front end in our course we're gonna put the entire backend with cloud functions and server less architecture and the whole nine and it'll be able to accept credit card payments and have stripe functionality and all of that so that's really the point we just go deeper in the profitable javascript program what's up bro how you doing what's up nice shirt nice shirt uh what's up guys we got about 208 viewers that is very nice so these are all the technologies we would be covering right javascript react node [ __ ] express redux next and the list goes on and you know you guys got some nice javascript instructors but i want to take on your guys's questions i don't want to just go over what's on the page i mean you guys can read it it's in the description so let's see what questions you guys got what math should i focus on this course so come on in us so for this course you guys don't really need i'll try to put this here you guys don't really need to be live and available just it's a prerecorded course so you can take it at your own pace you're welcome to take at your own pace the live coaching calls that's what you have to be there live for three of those happen one is with nas one is with sunny and then i think one of them is with success coaches but you know we also record those so if you're not able to make it to them you're able to watch them but we also so we also recently just added another coaching call we said another coaching call where basically guys we review your resumes so every saturday we review your resume so we have literally people from pwj they come in they send us their resume they sent us their resume right and then from that we go ahead me daniel or sonny we together we look at your resume we tell you what you need to improve hey all right that's what happens by the way every single time a a student joins profit with javascript i have a nice ringtone by dj khaled and he says another one and another one oh we can't do it it's we're pumped guys so everyone's saying every single time a student joins shout out to barticus weber he just joined prophet right javascript and then we also got harsh just joined profit with javascript welcome welcome yeah yeah but what i was going on is we now do coaching calls and resumes so you bring your resume and we tell you we need to improve and we literally even at a lot of the times we will write it for you we write parts of it for you so you can see a great example of how a resume should be like when you're trying to get jobs at companies and so forth and that has been amazing and so helpful for the students all right i'm looking for questions how much time does it take to learn react um honestly look at that just keep going let's go hey so for react guys it takes um i would say you know i if you join the course profit with javascript try to put in between 10 to 40 hours per week those are those that's the number where we see students getting good results and success with the program because oftentimes people think it's some kind of magic pill and it and it isn't um it requires you know a lot of work a lot of hard work and a lot of our students go through they keep trying like our best students will keep trying a lot of things they'll keep failing they'll show up to the live coaching calls hey welcome welcome who is it who joined one second let's see who joined just now wait but bartacus has already joined so why did it play again i don't know maybe you just played for him twice or maybe if you don't look at it it will play it at the second time oh yeah okay so yeah you guys can um 10 to 40 hours right not a magic pill you're gonna have to put in a lot of like hard work and a lot of our best students they fail many many many times but they keep going they come back to the community they come to the live coaching calls they fail again then they try again and it's just a cycle of error correction and very what seems like very slow and frustrating improvement but they just never quit they just keep showing up again and again and again and then they end up getting the results and it's most of the times for if you're committed it's not a matter of if it's often a matter of when sure how much can i make as a freelancer if i complete the course um if you really apply a lot of the things that we show you in the course i mean you should be it really depends on you right like we have students like lem kennedy who for example made um he made fifteen hundred dollars in his first three weeks in the program we have students like michael lecomp that cleared about six or seven thousand dollars in their first two months or three months of the program everybody is on a different pace now if you have you know somebody who's more advanced ryan noble who messaged me today and i keep telling him to get his ass on these calls and he never does because he's busy bro yeah so he's busy killing it and maybe i yeah so here here is here's ryan right so this guy messaged me and i was like yo i just ordered a mac pro and i gave him some tips and then he's like blah blah and then i replied to him i'm in blue right there and i said epic yo going live in an hour hour would mean the world if you could hop on and he goes lol if we can figure out a good time he goes i don't mind at all but he goes it's my mom's birthday and i'll record a video for you so this guy ryan noble he is one of the students that's more advanced and he's doing about twenty eight thousand dollars to forty thousand dollars per month on upwork so he's like really really crushing it and another level and so every student is going to be on at their own pace and going to be doing their own things for you like i can't i can't control you like we can't control you put in the work as much as ryan is right we can give you the guidance and we can give you the strategy and we can go here are all the tools for you to go and succeed and then it's really up to you how you actually put them to use and leverage them and how many hours and how much effort can you put in ryan was putting in you know probably 30 to 40 hours or more per week when i was coding and i got results and i got my first job you know within the first three to four months i was coding for 15 to 16 hours every single day so you know in my three months i covered as much coding experience as somebody would with one or two years of experience just because i put in as many hours as they would mish t mistake says is this one time payment method or can i pay on installment so we have a threemonth payment plan if you want to take that you can also use a threemonth payment plan here oh what's up in my alarms oh you guys can hear me now right yeah you guys can yeah that's really that's real make sure you get close and make sure it's like picks you up a lot yeah yeah they can hear me right now yeah i think should be fine what's up guys how you guys doing so good to see all of your amazing yeah what's up raha how you doing raha sanath hello hello we've got like george's question right there you see that george says as a person with very little experience in programming how many months would it take to get a job if i started studying every day um you can be very realistically looking at a job between the three month to six month mark so yeah if we and you can talk about this two nods but essentially where's my handy little app there we go all right so hopefully you guys can see this but if you're here george and right now like you're there's zero experience zero months of experience this is let's say three months of experience what is this all right and then let's say that this is like six months here right if you spend a lot of your time here and you make sure that you master the basics in the first month and then from month one to three so for those next two months you just build projects and i'm talking about the projects that you know that we show you in this program uh so of that caliber even if you don't join the program if you just build projects of the caliber of like a spotify clone or airbnb or hulu or netflix or tinder or tick tock or any of those that we show you how to build if you do that in the first three months then just for the next three months from the month three to month six simply just focus on actually trying to apply for a job and that should be pretty good yeah but i would also add to that i would also added that really quickly really depends on kind of a job you're trying to apply for like what you're talking about here is like a fulltime job or a potentially freelancing job right mmhmm but we have a lot of students for example like i mean yeah or a lot of students who came in with pretty much zero experience and one of the things they started doing guys is they started they learned a little bit they were going for they probably pretty much probably took about a month or so to learn and then what they did is they started coaching others who had zero experience right right and that to them was work right that's yeah that was their first kind of gamechanging that was their first monetary value they got from what they learned right so even though you probably might not be making as much as i get a fulltime job but right but by coaching number one number one listen closely you will you will earn money number two you will also learn more skills you will learn even more because by teaching you are also learning that's that's another thing that's also very important to kind of point out you know right those skills are important those skills are really important and it says nas not audible and sound of gnaws is fluctuating oh there we go now it's good were you muted yeah i was damn it oh [ __ ] all this time that i was talking talk talk again yeah so what i was talking about guys is what kazi was talking about is that the zero to three months from three to three to six months that kind of gets you to that gets you to a fulltime job or a freelancing job but a lot of times what we have when when students come into our program for example like a model isn't a great example yeah right um they come into a program they take the first month to learn right the skills those basic skills that that causes highlighting right now and then what they do is they teach other people who have zero experience or they have less experience than what they do so they coach and so what happens then is not only number one not only do they earn money right but number two they are also increasing their skills even higher right why because my friends by learning by teaching i'm sorry you are also learning because when you teach when you teach right you actually have to know your stuff so you'll you will have to be forced to really understand what is the full understanding of like for example right in react.js what are what is components or anything along the lines of like right getting deep down to the knowledge right and that's it yep all right so that should have been good i think they heard you there yeah they did um question if i am someone who's already gone through a boot camp can you tell me the advantage or differences benefits to relearn i think just as long as you just stay towards focusing on making real world projects and actual apps that are useful and then applying to work you're heading in the right direction so i wouldn't worry about just like relearning and being a professional student forever see another question how can a tent somebody ask a question i hate it oh okay yeah cause spam okay never mind yeah don't spam guys you'll get blocked yeah come on we're all just be all rolled nice here be nice be kind ah sure next block socket next block guys if you copy paste your question you're going to get blocked from chat so don't copy paste your questions um and if you guys want to send me projects that you guys have to review like if you guys want us to review any of your projects send uh it to us on instagram i think that would be dope project to review that'd be interesting yeah i think that'd be cool if you guys have any more valuable questions like that that might help you guys out definitely feel free to ask them but please do not do not copy and paste i see it muhammad i see you on here muhammad i see you bro this is not the way to do it man is up with these people dude does anybody want to moderate chat if you guys if any of you want a moderate chat and you're up for it just let us know so we can like kill the low quality like somebody says this course can also land ncp team hey kazzy can you rap somebody asked a question hell yeah you know it bro oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa i have you muted on like interesting so on these different mics i had you muted but now i should be good uh jitha says i can moderate okay thank you jay asked a good question do you see that huh jay asked a question right there what's the question i have a learn to react react native created a whole tinder app with react native but i don't didn't know i don't know how to get a job i'm in my first year of college okay so what's what's stopping you i mean i don't know your situation but it seems like what's probably stopping you from getting a job is i just have a hunch that you haven't applied enough you know and i don't know how many call with calls with like recruiters you've gotten with or job applications you have sent out do let us know if you have tried that but yeah because if you've done those things i think i mean you should be able to get some kind of job or interview or something yeah i think like for example i'll give you guys an example for me and i had a good amount of experience for me i applied i'm not kidding to probably 50 50 jobs like like when i was like i caught on it yeah yeah 50 jobs i applied when i was trying to get my first kind of like the internship my foot in the door mmhmm after the startup company 50 jobs guys 50 different resumes that's a lot of jobs yeah before i actually collected one yeah so if you haven't applied to 50 jobs keep going yeah thank you so much appreciate it man murder stack or mean stack or django for web um oh myrn stack or mean stack or jingle for web he asked i think just pick one doesn't matter yeah like as long as you can do it like i think you as long as you just pick one and stick with it and build things you'll be fine because there's there like you can do i mean you can even do django with combine it with the react like you'll be fine yeah so it you're gonna be good just pick one and get good at it yo bojack how's it going man hey bulldog what's up man yeah probably put your gain up now because i see you and you never go to yellow which means you're probably just really how about now dude things better right there yeah there you go going to like yellow especially yeah yeah things should be good now well your profit syrup says um nas please tell us what's inside the course and then delicious where can i find the detailed syllabus of the course we have right there i think you you if you go to how about this let's send them here oh that's interesting okay so if you guys want to see a detailed like what's in the course go to this url with slash pwjs at the end of it so i dropped it in the chat go here and here you'll actually see a more detailed syllabus of the course meaning there's the modules right there this section is going to show you what's in the modules yeah but we have more modules coming up yeah without more modules coming up but here you can see so for example you'll start off with you know what's like we're gonna actually develop a personalized roadmap for you because i think this is a really important thing if you're starting as a developer which is do you what do you even want to do do you want to do freelancing do you want to do full time do you want to do parttime or do you want to maybe coach other people and a lot of that depends on your personality type for example if you have a more riskaverse personality type meaning you want to run away from risk you are probably designed to do more fulltime work rather than freelancing work yeah but if you have a more risk tolerant personality then freelancing might be a better way to go for you because there's higher risk and higher reward and so in the program we even like actually help you identify your own personality type what kind of lifestyle you want to have how much money do you want to make and so the first module is all about that roadmap does that make sense guys now once we move past that and we help you develop your road map yo what's up logan he goes risk versus hey logan what's up man once we help you do that you know and guys so the program is designed with complete beginners in mind so if you are a complete beginner just know that we're going to be covering the javascript crash course so this is all the javascript basics that you need to know are going to be here after that we get into things like problem solving dom environment for javascript developers so this is where a lot of the stuff is going to be in one place for all of you guys which you know you might have trouble finding through just like random youtube tutorials because all of this stuff i think it helps when it's in one place so for example you know setting up your zsh terminal and setting up your environment well uh alfred so alfred is like this [ __ ] incredible productivity tool especially if you're using mac yeah it's like spotlight but on steroids yes exactly that we're gonna and we're gonna give you alternate um alternatives if you're using windows um spectacle this is a window management tool so for example like you know when i'm moving around how do i put this on half here or half here or make it bigger like this you know when i'm like coding how do i do this you guys have probably seen me do my window management a lot i'm using spectacle uh visual studio code so what are the exact extensions you need to use for example like prettier or es7 snippets so you can do the rfce hack and then your react component is like automatically completed brackets which is another extension in vs code which allows you to have the color matching at the end so when you're using javascript you know what's where something is starting and where it ends um i'll show you guys how to use vim so this is like a really powerful tool that most people don't use but if you actually learn it it just like supercharges you i love it it's like one of my favorite things to show you guys i'm okay with it i know i know kazuya likes it i'm i'm like i'm like okay you use it i sucked very rarely because kazuya know loves it so and i love it um and then things like dropler so you know if you are even trying to communicate with your team it's one of those tools that makes you so damn invaluable on a team so like for example if you want to work with your team on web development you're like hey this testimonial here should go down to the bottom right uh can we take this one and maybe center align it and instead write top five programming languages at the top boom so i'll do this now when i hit paste check it out right this is what's cool it's already a link so when i send it to my teammates on slack it'll automatically expand so if you're working on a team of developers guys this is very useful to be able to communicate like that does that make sense so tools like that all right let me go your modules all right and then of course stack overflow deeper into stack overflow and deeper into git and lots of hacks of course you're gonna build a bunch of mini projects projects like blackjack app or twitter clone google maps api with nas chandragashi arthur thanks so much for the donation my friend yeah yeah yeah 20 rupees i think yeah this chrome extension and how do you actually submit a chrome extension so that's another thing so them says the new landing page rocks yeah i agree thank you i want to send people here but then we they don't see our projects that we have no we don't this is now we know yeah yeah so that's the only thing about it yeah we'll be we'll probably update it at some point not at some point probably update it and actually test this one out i'm sure i i just you have to custom code it you know it just takes forever i know the custom code is not the best part guys yeah that that that says a lot like for example if you're if you if you have a client right and you're trying to build a project with them right the custom code is not always the best solution yeah all right i think that just shows there for example because like for example right this was built right we were the client right this was built for us yeah right and so and so now because it's custom coded like it's hard for us to change anything but yeah just a small tip right there exactly and guys the price of the program in one hour and 24 minutes exactly will go up to 6.97 guys will never come down guys get it while it's there guys this price will never be like this again sachin sharma says hey qazi do you cover know it and react in these modules as well so great question let me actually take you right over here hey vabov what hey another another one gabriel if you guys actually bought it from here from a single student that joins on this we will give you a call yes yeah so let's just call gabriel graves and let's see what happens let's do that are they on uh facetime or i'll see what happens calling gabriel graves who just joined that should be interesting just like the yo gabriel kazi here my man hey how's it going hey dude welcome to profit with javascript and you are actually live on the show with us right now we are on youtube right now oh man damn so tell us man what made you join profit with i'm a javascript programmer and i just recently went into django yeah okay i was like okay i need something printed i've been too long and tshirt for like 10 years yeah so then i was like okay let's try angular yeah let's try boo and i want to react it's like oh i kind of like this so then i came across your guys's stuff on youtube about let's see a month ago yeah and immediately i started learning even more damn wow that is amazing and what made you pull the trigger right now not some other day like what was it today that made you go man i'll join it like today um i'm on the live feed on youtube oh no way right now really yeah and i was probably about 13 minutes behind so like okay hey dude that's awesome that's right if you go to the live right now you'll actually see us talking with you yeah i need to catch back up that is awesome wow nice well gabriel welcome my man to profit with javascript we are very excited to have you and we can't wait to see you on those live coaching calls perfect gabriel we'll see you on slack and we'll see you on the coaching cause okay get ready for some dancing too okay sounds good all right brother take care have a good one oh that was sick damn that's awesome that was sick man that was sick that was sick yeah all right guys so we are at one hour and 21 minutes left um nas if you want to take on any questions i sent you i sent you a question when it was 397 back in jail i'll take your questions like actually but let me i'm going to read it out right now yeah so clear programmer so callofons asks what are the minimal skills for a junior developer and do you need to know design patterns and systems design what are the minimum skills for your junior developer minimum skills for a junior developer i feel like no some kind of full stack and be able to put together apps i think that would be pretty good yeah be able to do back end and front end you don't have to be like crazy high level with it you don't need to know like next js and server side rendering and all that stuff but i think if you can put together uh if you know uh backend front end if you know things like api um that's pretty good yeah i would say if you're someone who can take an idea um develop an idea and if you can go ahead and actually take that idea and develop that into a project so basically for example build a build a front end and build a back end um i will sell you i would i would say at this point you're pretty much a dream developer yeah you're dream developer then so that's so knowing the front end how to build up and but most importantly also knowing how to hey what's up beast rwa how's it going man um so knowing how to actually take a project and actually divide it up into small pieces and to actually start it because that's one of the things that a lot of newer newcomers have like issues with the newcomers um difficulties i'm trying to say yeah yeah but once you get kind of get past that that's when you're like okay you know what i got this hell yeah but then like even like what makes you like a like a scene developer like it's just like honestly it's so hard to exactly know yeah unless you sip big ass tea hey look at that uh huh uh donji's gonna get blocked in the chat oh yeah oh dang inglo thanks so much for the donation my friend thank you for the donation england user he goes autofix syntax text editor manual decode for beginners what though also which text editor do you use personally i'll be signing up after this video so sign up right now don't sign up after the wedding video sign up right now code um i'm i don't understand see auto effects syntax text editor or so which text editor do i use personally i use visual studio code when it comes to react and within visual studio code i use vim on top of it so then i feel like i get best of the both worlds i get the visual studio code and all the modern world beautiful gui that i get with it the extensions along with vim you don't need to use vim but that's what i use personally yeah and we would love to see you inside of the program don't wait to the end this video just do it now you know for joet moore says hey i'm at module 3. i just freaking loved in this course dude joined fast thank you so much man okay awesome thank you somebody somebody said um the best part uh sashim shanwa said the best part is the community who is there to help you out 24 7 no matter how small or large the problem is yeah that's true so i think that i think that's probably one of the biggest uh key points takeaways from this course courses in general where is like i wanna i wanna play some dramatic music guys i'm looking for some dramatic so there's you see us as system uh okay where no i mean i'm trying to find dramatic music i know how to play it popular suspense let me see suspense where right there uhhuh nice oh crap there we go what oh is it playing through the okay nice yo this is sick i mean i wish you could hear it but you know we'll have the shore mics on wednesday i think oh yeah that'll be that'll be cool now you we have three people at the same time that would be awesome yeah with some epic music guys if you're enjoying this smash that like button and subscribe guys for more videos like this guys and also very important share this with your friends share this channel with your friends we are doing some epic stuff here we are at one hour and 16 minutes left we will be live until this countdown timer goes to zero because it is our duty to make sure as many of you get into the best javascript course on the planet as we possibly can help get into this program oh ushi cash oh yeah what's up russian cash my bad my bad all right icon can only learning javascript make me land a job in fang so i no what will make you be able to land a job in big companies is that ultimately your problem solving skills along with what type of projects you can build and so you have to make sure that you get good at one problem solving and two being able to build projects that you have on your portfolio yeah portfolio will give you that interview they'll give you the chance to get past the recruiter they'll give you the chance for the interviewer to get impressed by you then in the interview your problem solving skills will help you get past the technical coding interview right that gives you the chance to then be able to land the job we are currently live guys live one hour left between before pwj price increases in one hour we're gonna be live on youtube me and kazi let's go let's go guys hey oh yeah sunny can go live on i'll go live on instagram as well because why not all right

when i went ahead and i interviewed with with the with google and they finished their faces showing in the yeah and they flew me down to california right they they only all they tell you is they're like just tell us what language you want to code in and that's it they don't care what language you know what they mostly care about is number one number one your experience okay number two how can you kind of like cause it because you already said this right how can you go how can you take a problem and divide this up into smaller pieces and how can you go out of the box to solve the problem right that is what they're looking for not so much what language you even know honestly xiaomi thanks so much for the awesome comment man i love your channel sonia kazi and nasa one of the best

real life bro uh it's mike i kind of just popped in i had no idea what's going on nice mike pumped to have you on the live call man i appreciate it so just give us a little bit about you i guess uh i work a lot it's kind of it um uh yeah what is your stream about man damn so have you been following clever programmer for a little while or just randomly youtube popped it on your recommended you jumped on oh it was only recommended and then i saw the stream and then uh something about a phone number just held up for a quick second just put my phone number in there are you interested in coding uh yeah damn okay um i have um some java experience so got it and are you are you interested in learning web development or things like that uh in what sense like http or yeah like making apps like tinder app or tick tock or learning how to make like netflix you know like cool [ __ ] like that oh that was you guys hell yeah bro that was us oh damn who else a little bit ago i i totally forgot about that yeah hey youtube never forgets that's why the pop didn't you recommend it bro yeah it's been a minute i didn't know we're busy yeah so yeah so that's cool you so you did build those apps no no not build them but i thought your streams about those all right yeah are you gonna ever build them [Laughter] i mean you guys already did it so um do you have a question for us if you're talking about like um my apps that like replicate it maybe okay and do you have and do you have any question for us while we are here if we can provide you with any value in anything um how did you guys come up with the idea to copy those apps and then make them and then you know process like that okay that's a good question so yeah how did we come up with the idea to make those apps and then put them up on youtube right yeah basically okay so we wanted to do something where we were like okay we are making tons of like tutorials but like kind of nobody was watching them and we're like what the [ __ ] like we're just we're spending all this time but it's not even helping anybody so we thought what are some hot ideas that we could come up with where we could get a lot of people's attention but then at the same time bring them a lot of value so that's how sunny and i were brainstorming and we came up with the idea of what if we started making like apps like real world apps like things that everybody knows and like plays with like netflix and spotify and twitter and tick tock and tinder so we're like okay let's do that and that's essentially how we came up with the idea and then as soon as we started dropping them it just started like banging hard it was like people you know went from like us getting like 3 000 views on the channel to like hundred thousand people would be watching you know 300 000 we're like okay we're it's helping people and then especially when people started using it to get jobs that's when we got really hooked on it because we're like all right let's keep doing this and not stop oh that's pretty good yeah no um um recommendation in terms of what uh an app that you guys could do if you guys want oh okay you have a recommendation for us yeah um have you done uh discord or telegram no we have not done a discord or a telegram actually yeah i think uh the discord one would be really cool because that's like a lot more unique all right and a little bit different dude this is [ __ ] cool right he's like yo i got a request for you like that's cool like that makes me want to get on there now nice okay yeah there was one that i i used for uh my internship a couple years ago and i'm drawing a blank on it would be perfect for you guys because it's like a chatting app yeah um like the company that i worked for for a little bit they used it i can't remember what it was it was like um it was like a basic chatting app i can't remember the name of it got it okay no worries my man but you want to see disc you want to see us make discord right yeah that'd be cool because it's like unique and it's a hot idea it would be a good idea it should be harder too okay dope so we'll make we'll make discord i think this week or the next week yeah it'd be kind of cool man i want to see where you guys take it on it okay all right we'll do it man thanks so much for your call and really appreciate your idea to actually make an app man that's awesome yeah no i'm sorry man i completely forgot that like um i was watching your videos of uh the skype and then all the other ones that you guys said yeah yeah um yeah and i'm surprised you too um that you guys saw my number in there yeah i don't know what your process is uh getting those numbers but it's really cool yeah you just dropped it in the chat and we called and this is really our first time doing it nas came up with the idea yeah so we're like let's do it all right thanks so much man thanks for calling into the clever programmer show we appreciate you brother have a good one and i'll see

i'm also very excited to be with you yeah dude thank you so much for being a supporter for the channel for a while and i think we've seen you in the youtube live streams in the chat and everything you've been jumping on those right for a while yeah and i love all your you know the team is so so loving and so entertaining and you know this this course is really worth it oh yeah someone from india wants to join in please don't wait damn he said it he's like if somebody from india wants to join you should join in he loves the team and how entertaining it is and how loving it is so thanks so much for that those kind of words man yeah i'm planning to join python also oh you're planning to join the python course as well yeah nice man we would be we would love to have you inside that program as well so what made you join profit with javascript today because i know you've been following us for a while but what was it that made you pull the trigger today uh yeah i've been thinking of this of course to join for long actually like for a month or so but i was you know i was just thinking of uh looking for free stuff but i was not fully invested in that and this course seems nice you guys have looked familiar friendly all factors you know vision and i find this course you know under uh um underpriced and i just joined i lost my job basically and with the help i'm gonna make some money so you lost your job recently what was it that caused you to lose your job um because of this coronal lay down was uh layup was going on yeah and yeah i think a lot of people are even in the united states a ton of people in our community are like they're furloughed from their work or a bunch of them are let go so it's you know yeah i don't know if you were there for the live stream we did earlier today when we had jen on she they had to let go 25 junior developers um and she was making about 50 000 a year she was one of the people that was let go because of covet like layoffs and then about a week later she got a job offer for um ninety six thousand dollars in the program so uh i want to you know thank you for doing this uh like for people like us to learn your technology in such a quick and easy way and you guys are so entertaining also at the same time you sonny everyone yeah we try we try to just be um as entertaining as possible and just make it fun because a lot of people you know they don't do that and i always wish that i learned from a place where not only was i learning good and correct information but i also wanted it to be fun i really wish uh the program will become number one you know yeah coding channel that's the goal and you must be getting a lot of love from india yeah a lot of love from india we really appreciate that yeah seriously thank you so much for being on the call saurabh we really really appreciate you and we will see you on the coaching calls yes indeed yes indeed thank you thank you all right take care saurabh appreciate you all right that was epic teja says saurabh man 43 000 is a huge amount you've spent especially since now you have been furloughed yep it is a huge amount it's no small amount to be able to spend that but if you have a source that you trust if you don't trust the source right then of course like you're never going to spend but if you have a source that you trust and you also trust your self it's an investment because what other vehicle is there right like if you lose your job well then your income goes to zero and if you don't change something ain't nothing gonna change no so you have to change the way things are going and maybe sometimes it means like making an investment in yourself getting coaching or getting help from people who can actually help you get out of there and then boom you're on the right track again maybe you just need that little push that little right advice at the right time and then boom just go flying yeah and i think it's very important guys to understand that the coaching and then the investment that you're making to yourself in terms of knowledgewise an investment where you go ahead you know either take lessons or you take coaching or you know you buy a course to increase your knowledge what you understand is knowledge will be there for the rest of your life right yeah so what you're learning is simply just going to be there with you to to to increase your value increase your selfworth and so much more than whatever that you're going to put in moneywise right now right you might be able to put in right now the cost of the program which is currently 5.97 but the return on that after maybe even potentially a month or two it's gonna be twice that three times death four times that ten times that and it keeps going and going and going so just keep that always in your mind yep abhinav says it's a good opportunity for soro he can put his all his time and effort into this course and he will learn so much which is difficult with the job so in a way i would actually argue that that's good that this happened with saurabh because it actually just allows him to have fulltime focus on improving his skill set so then the next job you get you should be looking sore up to get a job that'll pay you twice as much right just like jen she went from 40k after losing her job she was at i think 40 something k and then she went when she went back she got a 96k um job so i want you to be on a similar path where you get on a job and this is usd by the way right usd uh so i want you to in a similar path like that sort of somebody says can you make your paypal clone that would be interesting 40 minutes by the way that would be interesting i think that would be sick agreed yeah ready dev says hey i saw your ig story about making a challenge we're learning about starting a youtube brand hell yeah we want that yeah so that was an interesting one i i think you heard me making a story and i was like guys if you would be interested in like kind of how we grew clever programmer as a personal brand if any of you guys would be interested in that i was thinking about doing a 10 or like a 30 day challenge okay to tell people like exactly what videos to make exactly how to make them whether they have a budget profit with javascript prakash sunnis also jump on in a second prakash if you are here in the comments drop below the yo i just bought the course and we will call you my friend let's go yup welcome let's see precautions on i'm trying i'm gonna try to call him let's see what happens 40 more minutes guys 39 more minutes after this the price increases and 6.97 guys hey ali hassan uh mark alien says 40 minutes for what 40 minutes until the price increases permanently of the profit with javascript course yes signing out um priyanju is super pumped so yuri is here oh sayuri what's up sayuri so yuri what time is it there i feel like it's very late all right let's see if we can get sunny on hey please god don't give me those weird problems that happen when sunny comes on please oh sonny sadio we're going to be bringing on sunny guys it works what's up sonny something on your hand it's a very quiet day look at that inner men says five dollar donation thank you so much for that you go should i choose react or view choose react oh that reminds um we can't hear sunny at all it's like really quiet oh speak now hey i mean i can hear a little echo no no we're good we're good it's a little complicated you know the road caster you got like freaking i got my bluetooth phone connected i got my music thing i got the usb for the system audio so i had to just turn up the system audio i had it really low all right dude share your ecam just otherwise it's like super trippy all right bro bro we just broke 2 thousand members in pwj oh 2005. 2005. hey yo guys we got sunny on us everybody gets serious right now i gotta time that music right all right here i have to stop this because you and the music is coming from the system audio sunny dude welcome on the live stream prompt to have you here you're on on the instagram live right now you should get a headset so you can plug it in here otherwise you're just going to not know that you should get a headset plug it in no it's just like all right bro yeah how was the ig live that you did yo what's up corey good man yeah it's good we broke uh corey came on um we had preet came on so sarah and a few others yeah sorry jumped on pretty good dude damn i see people are joining that's awesome to see man no i actually got an epic idea now you have a word frank you have an iphone cable that you can connect um here and then to the iphone no iphone 2 usb yeah that's not just usb just a regular iphone yet cable that would connect here because then i'll be able to use this as a source what were you saying sunny my bad um i can't remember i wasn't i was just going live on instagram right yeah yeah yeah um i'm never usually up at this time and then i woke up randomly and i was like oh damn let me see and i was like oh they're live and then i was like oh and we have an hour left i was like what the hell it's like the gods are finally playing on our side yeah yeah dude let's just give everyone the best deal man seriously man yeah guys so you can see here 34 minutes left after this the price does increase we want to address any questions you have any concerns you have or if you even want to just jump on a call with us you can actually oh wait sunny's not showing up on this one boom pop that let's go and if you guys want to show up on if you guys want to get on a call with sunny and myself then drop your numbers and we can get on calls krishna says i joined pwg yesterday and really excited to learn i look forward to chatting in the coaching course dude make sure you're there every tuesday i run my coaching call so i'll be dope dude welcome to the team yeah welcome yeah dude i would love to okay man this is really cool yeah i just randomly decided to go live um at night yeah i was just feeling it we got a few oh yeah here we go we should dude we got a studio upgrade as well now who did it oh for early birthday present went ahead and grabbed me this look oh [ __ ] oh nice what is that nano leaves now and i'm doing up an office next door so everything's gonna be nice dude it's not long enough right no logan says name a more famous jail sonny plus the tommy hilfiger hoodies i finished the airbnb spotify cover tracker and amazon damn dude nice add that to your portfolio and have a awesome resume that is that's dope man okay tiffany y says i saw that pwg program projects are on youtube is a youtube or training course that is not available on youtube available exclusively in pwj so that's actually a really good question so think of it this way yes you get all the content that you get on youtube plus we pretty much go much further in depth plus if you don't know how to code we're going to teach you everything so all the fundamentals everything and on top of that we then go ahead and layer it with react and then add on the coaching course so coaching calls are pretty much going to be where you actually learn to make money with the skills so right now obviously we show you guys clones on youtube but we're not actually showing you really you know like the ins and outs because we're limited by time we're limited by those things but on the coaching calls we can go ahead and go really in depth and show you guys how to make money to land clients all that sort of stuff exactly and you know i said this earlier but imagine for example if on youtube we had the amazon clone but it's heavily focused towards the front end then in the course what we're gonna add for you is also backend functionality meaning you can accept payments you can add cloud functions a serverless architecture to your app and actually have a scalable app that can do everything so we'll go deeper in the program gabriel graves goes headphone cord wasn't long enough yep that's the problem you two would be hugging that's nasa's headphone cord nas was asking me just come closer bro oh is that where you plug it in the front you could do that bro oh nice i'll just move the camera a little bit oh holy hell damn you want to get a smaller cord next time i control that i'm having a doubt is i saw this course before okay pro vfx if you've seen the course before and you've seen it now open again then we're going to go lightly because in a week we pretty much close the doors to the same course that you just you're talking about so um we choose to like very carefully decide when we open and close the doors but if you're on the fence right now literally 30 minutes to save yourself money so make sure you go ahead and jump in you can save yourself that deal yeah yeah next week we're actually closing the doors to the program so that's another another one all right now let's make sure your head is in the your phone came through right there oh [ __ ] oh look at that because otherwise you won't be being picked up yeah yeah it's a funny situation we got over here this isn't easy bro let's go complicated scratch i wish your record was longer i wish too i think you guys know why or left so mdrana says sorry to say that i can't see this live because i'm on a deadline to complete the amazon clone okay aj says before joining this course i just wanted to know whether you guys teach a system design also what do you what do you mean by system design also and what i would say from experience all that stuff that you'd learn like system design or like drawing out those what are they called uml diagrams and stuff like that you learn that in university and nobody uses that [ __ ] in real life like that's the truth like as in like well rarely ever you use that stuff i mean like you the best thing you'll get to is like a white boarding exercise where you pretty much have like a whiteboard and you just have a few developers around throwing out a plan like it really goes down to like what's going to get you from a to b regardless of all the fancy sort of stuff so that's my advice on that on the topic yeah yeah exactly charles says saw the ig store is there a limit for the coaching calls three months or more so the coaching calls how we're deciding to do them is if you join the program you kind of get unlimited coaching calls now we can't legally say that because i don't know like what if some of one of us something god forbid something happens to right because we're human beings but um yeah so you are going to get coaching calls again unless something that we haven't thought about happens that we hadn't predicted you're going to be getting coaching calls for the for the whole year if not more when you join the profit with javascript program and that's kind of what makes it a very ridiculous deal and it's three to four coaching calls a week what's also worth mentioning is you actually get all the coaching calls uh that have already happened as well so you'll get that as a recording yeah mmhmm really literally going back to like months and months and months back to when it started yeah yeah harvard's in the house what's up that's fine that's fine oh okay it's fine all right we want to see they see they see enough of my face every single day all right i mean if you don't care about your face then i can just be more comfortable 27 minutes guys guys 27 minutes we go no nas domonsky logs trange without specs such google is offering job are you all serious krishna krishna asks i joined pwj if i work harder can i become a teacher to teach other success coaches as course says yeah if you you're not going to teach other success coaches i mean that's silly but you're going to teach like other people you know like you can teach people on yzant or you can put an ad on craigslist and you can be like hey i can build a todo list app with react if you're a beginner i can teach you how to do that they will give you money and you will teach them how to do that or you will teach them how to do basic for loops variables functions arrays all that stuff to teach it to people and they will they will in exchange pay you exactly and we actually show you a lot of techniques as to how to do that um because a lot of us do coaching rajit says i joined pwj let's go yo let's go it's so funny we have al al nasheen says i have an exam after 25 minutes whoa look at this and we have exactly 25 minutes left no way oh man and exactly 25 minutes but i i joined this live because i love your [ __ ] faces qazi sunny and nas nice man this is why your face is so important us in the video i guess that's what i've been trying to say the whole time look at how awkward dude because you guys should see how awkward this is right now nasa's like do you have another one of those headsets because my headset you know i have that like the stretchy cord i was like do you have another one of those headsets and i'm like yeah and he's like where and i pointed to sonny's headphones i was like uk yep priyancho was like the ukrainian guy is getting weird uh thomas says guys i'm still pumped i've learned a lot nice and if you guys want to jump on a call with us you can drop your phone number in the youtube chat and we will call you and nas me and sunny will get on a call with you charles christian says i want to join but my card won't let me pay 500 usd in one day how can a joy join uh the monthly so you can actually do the um the three month payment plan gonna show it oh nice um so you can actually do somebody join sunny yeah it popped up we have md so there this is the payment plan and this payment plan price will actually increase as well in 23 minutes but right now it's at 243 payments you just click here join now and that's what will get you there exactly also guys a little tip actually if you want to sort of if you have paypal paypal for six month finance and the link link is in the description by the way just in case that wasn't clear or cleverprogrammer.com pwj but sonny what were you what were you saying no i was just going to say somebody somebody says nas is eating the mic but um yeah if you here we go if you uh if you have paper available in your area make sure you actually go ahead and take advantage of something called paypal credit is zero percent interest like finance option and you get six months spreading it so that's actually something without any interest by the way yeah without any interest vibe lovers says guys i literally don't have money to join now will the price be cut or will there be a discount for thanksgiving or christmas and the answer to that is that we know that if we undervalue the program on thanksgiving or christmas or black friday what happens is that's what people wait for then and that's actually what the value of the course is in people's eyes so we never want to tarnish the brand that profit with javascript is and how much effort it took us to make it what it is and give you guys a premium quality service so no unfortunately there will never be a lower price ever for this program than this and we are very carefully right we move it up like if you guys remember when we launched it was at 197 last year those who joined it got that deal and it was amazing then we moved it up to 297 then we moved it up to 397 and it was at 397 for a really long time then in the last month we moved it to 497 and now it's at 597 and it's still a steal i think if you can get it for under 5 000 i think it's a steal because most coding boot camps that are even worth 15 000 most students tell us that it is worth more than those fifteen thousand dollars boot camps so if you can get it for less than five thousand i think it's a steal and you should jump on it and you shouldn't flinch if you have any amount of seriousness that you think that your career is important i think you should jump on it and take the course yeah guys most boot camps are actually like three three thousand pounds in the uk or like upwards from three thousand pounds and they're very much like you don't get the oneonone sort of aspect of it it's like a classroom yeah and yeah like you're not gonna be able to get like that personalized video feedback all of those extra things that we've kind of thrown in you know like i also saw john just joined welcome john well how are you seeing this this comes through on slack so i think the web hook fires off us got it oh i see md md islam just joined i seen that okay okay yeah mine was just like slower for some reason oh yeah yeah i just got that one nice oh and we got another one uh tiffany yang oh nice another one another one all right so yeah jon snow says i think it'll be better if you raise your camera a bit so i need to get a better view i don't exactly know what that means gabriel graves gabriel were you the person who was like telling other people to step it up he goes do you have many videos or plan in the future that use react as a friend and django as a backend for api if not i'm going to invest in node.js or whatever you guys are teaching yeah i think we're going to be going no js route in this program yeah yep zachary asks by the way guys i'm currently doing game dev should i still join just for the community support mike is pulling through nasa's mic is pulling through but you can't hear him from skype okay yeah yeah yeah it's a bit complicated here yeah yeah i'm currently doing game dev should i still join just for the community support and motivation because the web dev isn't really my target anymore um should you join for for if you just did join for the support and the motivation and the community yeah it's up to you one more question i was out yes here's here's my answer to that it's really quick really quickly yes why and it's not just because we want you to join the course but maybe we do but like it's also because one of the most valuable things that you can have in any development guys is the network that you have around yourself so who knows you might be doing game dev right you might not be doing web dev but check this out maybe there's someone in the community who has or is doing a game damn or game development or has a company with game development or has an opportunity with game development next thing you know you you're connected you're contacted and then you've got a game development position so yeah it's not so much just web dev game it doesn't matter what kind of development you want to do the community will provide what you need yes there's a lot of unknown questions as well in coding like because in people might not have no idea where to begin where to start with in some kind of community at least you can get like a direction for that because out of those 2 000 members i get another one i'm a pop star i'm not a doctor hey i like that song in here bro i can i can hear it dennis ficklin yo what's up dennis there we go dennis dicklin just joined prophet with javascript bro let's actually try to call him i'm going to call him right now i hope he doesn't do the what vip of this to us just hangs up on us yo dennis how's it going man you just jumped into profit with javascript oh yeah yeah hey nice man qazi here from clever programmer nice to meet you we are excited to have you um and you are actually live on youtube uh i'm curious how what made you pull the trigger to join profit with javascript today uh well um in the past i had um i have got like um i started learning a bit of flutter and i've always been interested in making like um some applications like just having to code once yeah and maybe like make a website or something and like kevin like being able to use that code to like make an application as well and i've always been pretty interested in freelancing i tried freelancing one time and wasn't really successful at it yeah and during that time i was trying to build uh build uh applications natively so i had the code once in java then code the entire app again in uh swift so that was a bit of a hassle so and i um i saw react and that was pretty interesting how did you see react was it you came and watched um one of our like clones or builds we were doing um well i once since i started flutter um i had heard about react i heard that was kind of hard and i i did see that you got i did see you guys um doing something live and that was pretty interesting yep did you i mean when you say we i saw you guys are you talking about me and nas me and sonny who are you talking about yeah yeah yeah you guys yeah um i saw you guys doing the live um so me and me and sonny oh by the way sonny's on the call too what's up dude welcome to the team what's up how you doing well good dude welcome to the family yeah it's um yeah hopefully learn a lot from you guys um i really i'm really interested in the freelancing thing yeah nice dope man i'm trying to i'm trying to not make this song you're not you're trying not to what i try not to make this awkward oh no man you're totally fine i didn't know i was going to get a call yeah okay no surprise it's all good man the the person who needed to make it awkward already did it before he was vaibhav and we called him and he was like talking to us and they were like you're live on youtube like tell us why you joined prophet javascript then he's just like nothing silence i'm like i see we're on the call like it says 41 seconds on the call 42 42 44. i was like way above are you there and then he just like hung up after 20 seconds i was like damn that was weird but you're fine yeah have um i have a spell into a rabbit hole just like trying to figure out which framework to use like uh which javascript framework yeah and i'm like an absolute move and i kind of just like got stuck yeah i shouldn't even be worried about that right now i should be worrying about learning the fundamentals first and then worry about that later yup that makes sense um yeah i think in this program just focus on learning the fundamentals and then building the projects if you do just those two things you will be in a re like in a better place than almost anybody else but it just requires a lot of like focus and discipline okay and you will have coaching calls with nas and sunny and these guys will help you build those projects along with what's inside the course and then step three for you you know step one being learn the basics and fundamentals step two build projects and step three just very simple we're gonna start helping you apply to jobs and then you're gonna land a job okay yeah exactly and we'll pretty much like in those coaching calls you can ask the question so the way you way i kind of say is like you go away you kind of work on the modules you build stuff out you figure out what works for you your sort of learning style and then on the coaching course it's very like critique based so like literally i kind of ask students like what's working for you what's not working for you we dive deep we go into like deep questions like if you wanna if everyone wants to land clients we'll go ahead and focus the entire core on how to land the client um or like how to land a student so all of that stuff make sure i'd say honestly if you could take something away from the course the main thing would be like take away the community and those coaching calls because the material you can always do at your own pace but you're going to get gold in those calls a lot of time okay cool um do you guys i know you guys um you delve in the firebase correct like you get into that yep um of course and he also get into other forms of back end like um like uh like node.js stuff like that yep we do node [ __ ] express all of that yeah wow that sounds cool i had like butterflies in my stomach right now i literally did not expect that is awesome dennis nice i love it damn bro we are pumped this live stream is so high quality it's like crazy i didn't even know this was possible but like sunny is in on skype in uk on a call with you i am you know in l.a you're somewhere else on a phone call

guys pwj guys two minutes link's in the description dude i'm actually excited the price goes up like it never comes down like i'm actually excited about that oh that's gonna be so good it's gonna be insane dude we've worked hard for this moment it's true actually it's kind of exciting right like that countdown's getting me a bit bummed up yeah cause like we've i mean i want to get to those when it gets to zero minutes you know because like we have worked so tremendously hard to make it truly the best experience like the bentley or the rollsroyce or the louis vuitton when it comes to programming material and make it so different and like upper echelon and give you a vip experience and even give you success coaches personalized and dedicated to you they give you video feedback on everything you do i mean it is just it is dialed in i mean it's a extremely sophisticated program and it's pretty pretty amazing how we were able to form a team together to economically make it work where we could literally take a program that should be 15 000 and provide it for 600 right like that is actually um it's it's fascinating exactly one more minute guys oh that's true actually dude like the amount of value they're getting for the price second how we've managed to actually get it down to that price like it's it's insane the value we can deliver off the price of the course oh jose mcguire just got charged um i just joined okay so we're gonna see that notification probably come through shortly and welcome jose appreciate jumping having you jump in here guys 42 seconds if there was a time the time is now to join profit with javascript before the price has changed and you can still get in and you still see that price and if it's available i highly recommend that you jump in and take that chance on yourself 20 seconds guys 20 seconds what are you waiting for my friends keep going jump in the program 10 seconds exactly eight seven six five four three two one damn guys wow thank you guys for being on here with us we appreciate you so damn much i mean we are very excited for the future of this program profit with javascript where we're taking it um i appreciate you guys jumping on the live call with us today our goal is in a week from now we're gonna be shutting down the enrollment to profit with javascript and then what we want to do is essentially just focus on every single student that's inside of the program and we just want to help you get massive results in your career and we're gonna be also back to our massive value bomb use youtube live streams that we normally do exactly i'm gonna be dropping those guys for you react native loads of stuff coming your way guys yeah in outside the course that's right so guys is there anything you want to say sunny to end it off with i want to say guys you guys are awesome and if you haven't already had a chance i mean see if the price i know a lot of people even when it did increase last time somehow they managed to get the old link yeah so uh and actually atarva actually joined that way so yeah make sure you guys go ahead and smart about it and like we said guys you cause the one thing i want to shout is cause he said you won't get your time back right that's the one thing that like you're just not gonna get back so rather than thinking as an investment in the course think of it as like investing your time somewhere important right so that's something which is which is going to change your life and it's the only way you can actually change your life so do something big do it today yep because what's the alternative yeah what is the alternative you spend worst case scenario you spend the 600 investment 597 investment and it doesn't turn out you tried right yeah but what happens on the other side if you spend 597 and you can actually get a job that pays you between thirty thousand dollars or fifty thousand dollars or eighty thousand dollars or more per year that is where your win is at you should be like bullheadedly focus on the value that exists you can get out of it even when i was starting my business at clever programmer like i took debt to take a four thousand dollar course i used my credit card with debt to take a four thousand dollar course and it's not [ __ ] you can actually go to youtube and like actually go to 2017 and then drop the video in january which talks about me buying a 4 000 course and actually buy it live in the video and so it was an investment and i took a risk to grow clever programmer to have that vision and like just keep going if you invest in yourself it's rarely a thing that like it's a thing that can't be taken away from you it's not clothes it's not a car it's not something that somebody can strip away from you it's a skill that's there with you forever and money is just a lagging indicator of skill and value so if sonny knows the skill of react it doesn't matter what happens to him today or tomorrow if he loses his job he has the skill set to be able to get a job at any time any place and get a high paying job exactly guys and yeah i think the key one there is money the money is a lagging indicator like that's huge like it is so true guys focus on the skill build up that skill and then it really doesn't matter what position you're in covet covered or not like you can pretty much save yourself in any situation with that yeah yeah i think i think for me personally kind of what drives my decisions guys is what kazu said which is what is the alternative if you think about the alternative to buying this course is not buying and basically going the same path that you were going before that's the path of right being stuck in the youtube tutorial hell not knowing the road map not being able to get a job and not being able to get a freelancing gig or not have a community when i every time i ask myself this question and i get a bad answer because the alternative of not doing something i want to do it's like heck no i don't want to go that route i don't want to go the route of the scene that i've been going for the past months the past years what requires is a change and this can be your change that's it exactly with that said guys thank you so much for being on here and being with us we love your beautiful face this is qazi this is nas this is sunny and we will see you in the next video you
