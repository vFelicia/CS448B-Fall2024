With timestamps:

00:00 - now so like a hundred days of
00:01 - documentation right
00:03 - which means like documentary is the
00:04 - journey and amanat is really one of
00:06 - those people who does it
00:07 - right they do it he does it as you
00:08 - should because he's had days where he's
00:10 - been stuck
00:11 - on debugging he's been days on things
00:13 - have gone really well
00:14 - and he documents everything because
00:16 - that's the reality guys and that's
00:17 - actually what happens
00:19 - so whether it's instagram facebook
00:21 - youtube
00:22 - um and also this i really want to add up
00:24 - and add on to this right
00:25 - by just writing some content as whether
00:28 - it be like
00:28 - i don't know how to write a component in
00:30 - react whether it be like
00:32 - how to style something with flexbox by
00:34 - writing that out and by teaching someone
00:36 - else it
00:37 - you're going to actually reinforce your
00:39 - knowledge of it massively
00:41 - right and that's exactly the benefit
00:45 - exactly it's like it's like that um when
00:48 - you actually teach someone you actually
00:50 - learn much more than when you try to
00:52 - learn by yourself so when you try to
00:53 - teach someone you know a certain thing
00:55 - let's say you want to
00:56 - let's say that you know you want to post
00:58 - a an instagram post
01:00 - on you know react to basics right yeah
01:03 - you know you're going to learn
01:05 - the you know the really big fundamentals
01:07 - the very important amount because you
01:08 - know you got to teach that right you
01:10 - have to know that before you teach yeah
01:12 - and so that actually forces you to learn
01:13 - even better
01:14 - right so that's why you say like record
01:16 - your entire journey post things online i
01:18 - know ahmad is doing a great job right
01:20 - amanda for example he
01:22 - is from with all that he is doing he's
01:24 - also now
01:25 - getting coaching clients literally and
01:27 - is actually
01:28 - making money at that point so yeah crazy
01:30 - stuff seriously
01:31 - do it and trust me you were um i don't
01:35 - think you will not regret that
01:36 - yeah exactly our lovely comment by here
01:39 - he said
01:40 - sunny is going to inspire me thanks a
01:41 - lot bro because of you i'm not oh that's
01:43 - good
01:43 - thank you so much amanda and i really
01:45 - love your journey and keep doing what
01:47 - you're doing bro
01:48 - nice um uh we also want to add one more
01:51 - thing here guys
01:52 - uh it's not just about like sharing the
01:54 - journey right
01:56 - by doing that without realizing you're
01:58 - actually going to be
01:59 - building like your own personal brand
02:02 - okay
02:02 - so there's one thing working in a
02:04 - company there's one thing freelancing
02:05 - and doing this sort of stuff
02:07 - but if you just get involved and you
02:09 - start sharing your journey
02:10 - i promise you guys without even trying
02:12 - you're going to actually slowly build a
02:14 - bit of momentum and traction
02:15 - as to our following you're going to get
02:17 - a natural following of people who are
02:19 - interested in coding
02:20 - and interest and you're going to get
02:21 - like a more like-minded people sort of
02:23 - naturally start to surround you
02:25 - why this becomes really useful is
02:27 - because when you start growing your
02:28 - social media presence
02:30 - let's say you start offering coaching
02:31 - sessions and you want to have you want
02:33 - to start teaching people one-to-one and
02:34 - you want to make a little bit of extra
02:35 - pocket money
02:36 - you just need to add one story on
02:38 - instagram and immediately you've got a
02:39 - thousand people
02:40 - that are gonna see that right and
02:42 - they're all coding people they're all
02:43 - like people in the developer community
02:45 - and i guarantee if you just get one
02:47 - person who replies to you that's
02:48 - potentially one person you can start
02:50 - teaching
02:50 - and you can start making that income
02:52 - from so it's not only going to benefit
02:54 - you in terms of learning
02:55 - it's actually another source of income
02:57 - so it's actually going to be a really
02:58 - powerful thing for you
03:01 - exactly exactly just there's so much
03:02 - opportunity guys seriously
03:04 - there's a ton of opportunity out there
03:06 - on social media online
03:07 - use it for your own good go out there
03:09 - put yourself out there right because the
03:11 - only way that people can see you is if
03:12 - you put yourself out there
03:14 - right and so if you do it you are more
03:16 - likely to get something back something
03:18 - like
03:19 - you know there's a there's a saying put
03:21 - good energy out and good energy will
03:22 - come back
03:23 - exactly i live in that right now and
03:26 - like nars is living
03:27 - there he's living breathing proof of
03:29 - this guys like if you go to one of his
03:31 - coaching course
03:32 - you come out of it feeling like you're
03:33 - about to wake up like it's crazy

07:03 - some salsa
07:04 - oh i'm not like right now
07:08 - all right fine fine all right none of
07:10 - the time but anyways guys let's go ahead
07:11 - and answer some questions
07:13 - you know if you guys want you know if
07:15 - your question is you know
07:16 - let's let's get signed to dance that's a
07:18 - good question as well but
07:21 - but yeah let's see what questions
07:24 - will come up because like you know what
07:26 - one thing one thing i know is like
07:27 - uh oh somebody asked nakul asked i want
07:30 - to
07:30 - do you want to put in i was like i want
07:32 - to apply for react.js internship what
07:33 - strong part should i should i have
07:35 - like what strong suits should i have do
07:37 - you have issues the question really good
07:38 - question yeah so
07:40 - uh react.js internship what strong parts
07:42 - should i have so it's really good
07:43 - question thanks for asking that call
07:45 - i would recommend that you pretty much
07:47 - um
07:48 - understand so in react you have two
07:50 - types of uh
07:51 - two ways of writing components right you
07:54 - have class based
07:55 - class based and you have functional the
07:57 - first thing is i would recommend that
07:58 - you learn
07:59 - uh very very thoroughly how to use
08:02 - both right because that becomes an
08:04 - immediate valuable skill to have
08:06 - you can go into a company and you can
08:07 - say right even if the code base is class
08:10 - based and and the difference here guys
08:12 - is one is just the older way of writing
08:13 - things one is the newer way of writing
08:15 - things but
08:15 - the newer way is really nice but most
08:17 - code bases have the older way
08:19 - so a lot of companies actually pay you
08:21 - to come in and just go ahead and change
08:22 - everything to the new uh
08:24 - the new stuff without breaking things in
08:25 - between right so if you can do that
08:27 - then uh that's definitely a valuable
08:29 - skill so i would recommend learning
08:30 - about class based and functional
08:32 - and then i would go ahead and pick up
08:35 - all of the fundamentals like react hooks
08:37 - i would look at the react context api so
08:40 - um
08:41 - for many of you guys who haven't used
08:42 - react before this could sound like buzz
08:44 - words
08:44 - um but if you are looking at react then
08:46 - just get a pen and paper on
08:48 - these down so it's react context api
08:49 - react hooks um
08:51 - and once you know about react hooks i
08:52 - would look at something called redux and
08:54 - once you know redux yes
08:55 - you're at a point where you're pretty
08:56 - much ready to jump into your first
08:58 - position
08:58 - so once you overcome that pattern and if
09:00 - you guys do want to look at an example
09:02 - of redux
09:02 - yesterday's live build of amazon we
09:04 - actually cover that so
09:06 - go and check it out if you are
09:07 - interested yeah and
09:09 - i would also say react jsx right jsx
09:12 - yeah right that's the one right yeah
09:13 - reactive effect which is the way
09:14 - a way to to write html using using
09:17 - basically react
09:18 - using javascript basically using react
09:20 - that's another another big point i think
09:22 - yeah i think to learn yeah that's that's
09:24 - definitely that's actually quite an
09:26 - essential thing you need to understand
09:27 - how to use jsx
09:28 - yeah yeah and what is the css i forgot
09:31 - because i used to use css where i
09:33 - actually used
09:33 - i built i built css with javascript as
09:36 - well what is that
09:37 - that one called i forgot um oh so
09:39 - there's a few there's css
09:41 - is sas that you made no no no there's
09:44 - one was like
09:44 - react build i forgot about that
09:51 - [Applause]
09:54 - style sheet anyways maybe i could bring
09:56 - up some later time
09:57 - yeah okay so um if you if you guys have
10:00 - any questions around that drop them in
10:01 - the comments because that's actually a
10:02 - really good question
10:03 - somebody actually said something um i
10:05 - tried to pin it okay yeah this one here
10:07 - vikrant seth said help so there are
10:10 - times when coding we feel
10:11 - like giving up in between what should we
10:13 - do at that time
10:14 - so nashville take that one
10:18 - yeah so actually a lot a lot of students
10:19 - will actually actually get this a lot
10:21 - from students
10:22 - um in terms of you know hey i don't kind
10:24 - of you know i feel
10:26 - i feel like i just can't do it
10:29 - um like my answer my answer to this is
10:32 - is honestly like i'm not trying to think
10:34 - kind of what to say in terms of
10:35 - like you know to actually give you some
10:37 - actionable things to do
10:39 - um one thing one thing i would say is
10:41 - this is not an actual one but like
10:43 - one is don't put so much pressure on
10:46 - yourself
10:47 - like why are you putting so much
10:48 - pressure on yourself that you know
10:50 - because the reason why you don't feel
10:51 - like you know you feel like giving up is
10:53 - because you put so much pressure
10:55 - and you know on building something or
10:57 - you put so much pressure that you need
10:58 - to understand something so quickly
11:00 - that now you feel like well you know i
11:02 - can't really get it that fast
11:04 - and so now should i even learn it at
11:05 - that point right yeah
11:07 - but if you don't put too much pressure
11:09 - and you make it so much more about
11:11 - hey this is a fun thing to do let me see
11:14 - how i can learn it and let me put myself
11:17 - to the challenge to actually try and get
11:18 - it
11:19 - okay if you think of it more so it's
11:21 - just a fun thing that i'm going to learn
11:23 - instead of putting so much pressure i
11:24 - have to know this
11:25 - i have to get this to get a job and
11:26 - everything then it becomes a lot harder
11:29 - yeah but if you are stuck in that
11:32 - position where you know what i feel like
11:33 - i feel like giving up one release
11:35 - yourself of that pressure
11:36 - two two find um
11:40 - like i said find may potentially find a
11:44 - actually here's one thing that i would
11:45 - say is find small wins
11:48 - yeah because wins give you confidence so
11:50 - for example let's say
11:52 - actually i would recommend this
11:53 - situation do like a small
11:55 - youtube tutorial for example okay and
11:57 - code along with that person
11:59 - maybe join a course like part of a
12:01 - javascript link in the description
12:06 - join the course for example right and
12:08 - start getting small wins
12:10 - okay maybe it's you built a small
12:11 - program maybe you built a small you know
12:13 - uh card for example maybe you build a
12:16 - small
12:17 - a small like a weather weather
12:19 - application right anything that gives
12:21 - you like a win
12:22 - like sparks interest it's like hey i got
12:24 - this let me get
12:25 - let me see what else i can get i got
12:26 - this let me see what else i can get
12:28 - and by giving yourself momentum right by
12:30 - giving him this momentum
12:32 - you can basically br you can basically
12:34 - go a lot further and now use the
12:36 - momentum basically just keep going and
12:38 - keep going and keep going
12:39 - so that is kind of like i said i would
12:40 - say my answer to that yeah what about
12:42 - you
12:42 - really really nice like how you put that
12:44 - um i would say like perseverance guys
12:47 - for me is is gonna be the number one key
12:49 - thing because like
12:50 - in coding like that you you are i'm just
12:52 - like i'm gonna put it out there you are
12:54 - going to hit
12:55 - some really tough times where you will
12:57 - be at your computer for hours
12:59 - like you will be stuck at your company
13:00 - of hours and it doesn't matter if it's
13:02 - like a very simple error or like
13:04 - a really sort of complicated era like
13:06 - i've been stuck on my computer sometimes
13:07 - for the most
13:08 - basic things guys i've probably spent
13:11 - like eight hours once like
13:13 - figuring out like how to loop through an
13:15 - array properly
13:16 - right like i said and i was like oh my
13:18 - god like and now
13:20 - you'd see me like and this is what i
13:21 - want to really sort of like kind of
13:23 - draw a straight line over is that you're
13:24 - going to see me now in tutorials and
13:26 - like nars coding
13:27 - and you're going to be like wow they
13:28 - just seem to like know everything they
13:29 - know how to write all their code but
13:31 - like
13:31 - guys that's after going through like god
13:33 - knows how many hours of like
13:35 - sitting there banging our heads against
13:36 - the keyboard like like oh my god i want
13:38 - to quit i want to give up i'm not built
13:40 - out for this like
13:41 - it's a normal feeling and the number one
13:43 - thing i will say is just
13:44 - keep on moving forward like keep on
13:46 - going like don't just
13:48 - do not quit because i guarantee and this
13:50 - is why i love coding so much that rush
13:52 - that you get
13:53 - when you overcome that problem finally
13:55 - at the end that rush is unlike anything
13:57 - else like i
13:58 - to be honest i'm yet to find something
13:59 - which matches it like when i'm sat there
14:02 - bugging for like eight hours and i
14:03 - finally get my code working
14:06 - and then you deploy it and you do all
14:07 - your stuff and then you can go about a
14:09 - day
14:09 - it just sets you off from such a good
14:11 - mood and it's like the best i know
14:14 - yeah it's like it's like you realize oh
14:16 - man
14:17 - i missed a semicolon and that took you
14:19 - about eight hours to figure out
14:20 - yeah like at one point you're like
14:22 - really mad but you're also like
14:24 - hell yeah yeah exactly like in the
14:26 - beginning you're kind of like in this
14:28 - this weird place of like i'm really
14:30 - angry and disappointed with myself but
14:32 - i'm also like the most happiest i've
14:34 - ever been
14:36 - yeah yeah there's a lot and i think
14:38 - there's a very big joy i get personally
14:40 - like from building like a project like
14:42 - like like right now for example guys
14:44 - like really cool project that we're
14:46 - building right now with
14:47 - students actually check this out hold on
14:49 - maybe i can send you a link hold on hold
14:51 - on maybe you can actually share this
14:52 - let me see um we're building kobe
14:55 - tracker guys we are building a covey
14:57 - tracker and it's actually me and sunny
14:58 - are going to be doing by the way
15:01 - this is like a really cool announcement
15:02 - me and son are going to be doing a cover
15:04 - tracker building a cover tracker with
15:06 - react next monday next monday
15:09 - so drop in the comment below if would be
15:11 - excited
15:12 - to build something like this because
15:14 - it's something that's completely new
15:15 - right
15:16 - it's going to look amazing it might
15:18 - actually look something like this so
15:19 - actually let me see
15:20 - let me let me give you a link that you
15:22 - can probably show to them as well
15:23 - yeah uh so guys let us know in the
15:27 - comments while nars is finding that if
15:29 - you're excited to build a covert tracker
15:31 - uh it looks amazing this app looks
15:33 - really nice and we're going to show you
15:34 - how to build it
15:35 - and this is a complete beginner tutorial
15:37 - guys so it doesn't matter if you don't
15:38 - know how to code
15:39 - you can go along with us and you can
15:40 - build this as well and you can add it to
15:42 - your portfolio
15:43 - so okay go ahead right let me open this
15:47 - up for you guys
15:48 - so we've got no here we go
15:52 - so this is something that currently our
15:54 - students are building right
15:55 - in the profit of javascript so again if
15:57 - you want to build something like this
15:58 - and know that deep down on how to build
16:00 - this in the live coaching call so
16:02 - for example with me and sunny right we
16:04 - get to ask questions
16:05 - link is in the body make sure you profit
16:07 - with javascript
16:08 - you will not regret it yeah so here we
16:11 - have it guys
16:12 - um we have the covid 19 tracker so you
16:15 - can see like
16:16 - we can select countries from the drop
16:18 - down so if i go ahead and click this
16:21 - well you refresh it you're refreshing
16:23 - refresh it hold on okay refresh it
16:24 - start amazing and you're just not
16:25 - showing the actual case there we go
16:27 - there we go so hold on is it it's still
16:30 - not
16:30 - no i mean it might just be a delay i
16:34 - think my
16:35 - could be the internet connection
16:39 - is it working on your machine guys yeah
16:42 - yeah yeah interesting maybe uh
16:46 - sort of like but what you basically can
16:50 - do guys is you can you can select from
16:51 - this drop down you'll be able to select
16:53 - like
16:53 - the united states or the uk and it will
16:56 - show you not only it will show you like
16:57 - a live
16:58 - breakdown of country by country with
16:59 - your number of covert cases
17:01 - but it would also zoom into the map
17:03 - dynamically so imagine like it would
17:04 - literally zoom into the map at different
17:06 - points
17:07 - highlight the uk with this really nice
17:09 - circle illustration of depending on how
17:11 - many people
17:12 - have been infected with uh coronavirus
17:14 - and it will show you
17:15 - like stats of that thing and you can
17:16 - basically from this drop down click like
17:18 - international
17:19 - and this map reacts dynamically to that
17:21 - so it's going to be a really really nice
17:23 - build and again you guys will be able to
17:24 - add this
17:25 - to your portfolio so let us know in the
17:27 - comments if you find that exciting and
17:29 - if you are ready to do that
17:31 - and we will build that for you guys on
17:32 - monday can you open this up in safari
17:35 - try this up in safari actually yeah
17:37 - let's give that a go
17:39 - yeah let's try it i'm very curious why
17:43 - it's not showing up the cases on your
17:44 - side this will be interesting
17:46 - let's have a look um
17:49 - [Music]
17:51 - no let's go ahead and check if there's
17:54 - any errors
17:55 - coming back see guys
17:58 - this is this is the magic of coding guys
18:02 - there you go jquery is on jquery is is
18:05 - not different it's not defined
18:07 - interesting um
18:11 - oh maybe the shot oh maybe because it's
18:13 - very location
18:14 - based because i'm getting there's a cdn
18:15 - that's getting jquery
18:17 - [Music]
18:21 - okay all right okay okay oh
18:24 - nice yeah javascript
18:28 - yeah guys if you haven't already check
18:29 - this out make sure that you guys go
18:31 - ahead and check the link in the
18:33 - description
18:34 - uh if you've enjoyed the video so far
18:36 - and you found that some of the advice
18:37 - that we gave you is pretty useful
18:39 - then you can go ahead and check out this
18:41 - is pretty much where me and nars live
18:43 - we live inside of the community and guys
18:46 - we own this course
18:48 - yeah we live here like very much inside
18:50 - of this course
18:51 - like we offer a bunch of so not only do
18:53 - you get personalized video feedback from
18:55 - all of the homework submissions that nas
18:57 - sets
18:57 - every week in your coaching course so
18:59 - you get live
19:00 - feedback you get success coaches you get
19:03 - weekly
19:03 - javascript and react training calls so
19:05 - that's all of the javascript
19:07 - fundamentals and pretty much from a to z
19:09 - in javascript
19:10 - with nars and with me you'll be building
19:12 - uh fun little react apps that we can
19:13 - pretty much go in and
19:14 - and guys like when you build these apps
19:16 - you pretty much have like you can
19:17 - message me on slack you can come and
19:19 - show me your code
19:20 - i love to see what you guys build and
19:22 - yeah you can message us through slack
19:24 - and also guys these are it's all cool
19:25 - knowing how to learn how to code in
19:27 - javascript right but the main thing we
19:28 - want to do is show you
19:30 - how to make a killing with that through
19:32 - those skills yeah
19:33 - we're going to show you how to go from
19:35 - um being able because like this is the
19:37 - problem i find in most of these
19:38 - tutorials they teach you how to do stuff
19:40 - but they don't actually teach you how to
19:43 - actually go ahead and make some money
19:44 - with it right so we have plenty of
19:46 - different methods
19:47 - and our students are actually making a
19:49 - fair amount of money a lot of the
19:50 - students right now which is really nice
19:52 - like i love seeing um when students
19:54 - share their success stories with us um
19:56 - so yeah if you do want to go ahead and
19:58 - like you can just come check this page
20:00 - out it's in the link in the description
20:01 - and you guys can go and check that out
20:03 - for yourself awesome
20:05 - yeah check it out if you're interested
20:06 - if you by the way we do have it we have
20:08 - a 30 day money back
20:09 - so if you don't like it return it but
20:11 - you know i think i like it in either
20:13 - case
20:13 - trust me just yeah yeah you're going to
20:15 - like it just just trust me just trust us
20:18 - exactly nice um
20:21 - let's have a look at some of these uh
20:23 - things uh comments so we've got i spent
20:25 - a week
20:26 - okay so devin gray devin grey actually
20:29 - joined
20:29 - the other day so he's new to the course
20:30 - i believe um so he said i
20:32 - was a week trying to deploy my website
20:35 - to a server wondering why i can see it
20:36 - my euro only to find out my website was
20:38 - pointing
20:39 - to the wrong url yeah and then he and
20:41 - then he said he added another one he
20:43 - goes i was laughing at 4 am
20:45 - from happiness when i finally
20:49 - [Music]
20:52 - oh man the happiness you probably got
20:54 - this is it's so good
20:56 - yeah exactly like it's really gonna take
20:58 - you like it makes you so happy guys
21:00 - let's have a look um oh no this one
21:03 - might be good for you like uh so what
21:05 - are the best ways
21:06 - of flying or finding uh clients for your
21:08 - product so yeah
21:09 - i think we'll answer this in the way of
21:11 - finding clients
21:12 - um for like uh freelance projects
21:16 - yeah yeah so i think i think that in
21:18 - terms of finding clients for your
21:19 - freelance projects and i've done
21:21 - freelancing for a year
21:22 - the number one thing that i would say is
21:25 - honestly probably when you're first
21:26 - starting out it is
21:28 - through people that you know like you'd
21:30 - be surprised like how big your network
21:32 - is
21:32 - like what i would say and this is pretty
21:34 - much how i started is i literally
21:35 - started asking people like that i know
21:37 - hey do you know anybody who needs some
21:39 - work done hey do you need anybody who
21:41 - needs some
21:42 - freelance client work okay and the
21:44 - reason why
21:45 - the reason why you ask that question you
21:48 - basically you ask around for
21:49 - the people you know is because it's the
21:51 - trust factor
21:53 - yeah you're a lot more likely to get a
21:55 - job if someone trusts you
21:57 - versus if you're like hey i don't know
21:58 - who this guy is i'm not gonna i'm not
22:00 - gonna pay him
22:01 - right so the biggest thing in
22:03 - freelancing guys is honestly
22:05 - trust like that that is what
22:08 - that is basically if i if there's
22:10 - someone who
22:11 - you know there's someone who i know okay
22:14 - who maybe is a bit
22:15 - more expensive okay versus someone who i
22:18 - don't know but it's actually cheaper
22:20 - i'm gonna go with someone who i know
22:22 - yeah right
22:23 - so trust is a big fight so the first way
22:25 - is to find is through people you know
22:26 - that's part one
22:27 - part two is you can go on on websites
22:30 - like freelancer.com
22:31 - and upload.com and you can find them
22:33 - there but most important thing is
22:35 - build that connection build that network
22:37 - go to meetups
22:38 - see other people that is how you're
22:41 - going to get your freelance clients
22:43 - so yeah that is going to be my answer
22:44 - for that items honestly yeah and that's
22:46 - so
22:46 - powerful and i said because like guys
22:48 - like i thought initially there would be
22:50 - websites
22:51 - i'd have to go to but the truth is when
22:52 - i started freelancing it was all through
22:54 - word of mouth
22:55 - like everything was through word of
22:56 - mouth and i was like whoa like it was
22:57 - just somebody would randomly give me a
22:59 - call and say like oh hey
23:00 - you know so and so and i know that you
23:02 - can code and you can do stuff and i'll
23:04 - be like oh yeah sure like i can take
23:05 - this on let's have a look
23:06 - and you just start a conversation and
23:08 - before you know it like things are
23:09 - happening
23:10 - and you start working on these projects
23:11 - so like no i said go to these meetups go
23:14 - to
23:14 - these conferences and sort of be a part
23:16 - of these groups and communities
23:18 - and you will naturally start to see
23:19 - those conversations start to come about
23:22 - exactly exactly yeah awesome let's have
23:25 - a look at some more questions
23:28 - um right
23:33 - somebody said there's something said do
23:34 - i have to learn javascript in depth like
23:36 - recursion a lot all like to get a job
23:38 - and react
23:39 - uh do you see that yeah yeah so this one
23:42 - right here
23:43 - so ajinkya said do i have to learn
23:46 - javascript in depth like like recursion
23:49 - and look okay so good question
23:50 - so honestly recursion not necessarily
23:55 - is it a a valuable skill to have yes is
23:57 - a valuable skill to have i mean like
23:59 - it's cool to know
24:00 - how often do i actually use recursion i
24:02 - mean that's how often do you use
24:03 - recursion
24:05 - like clearly i use recursion you know
24:08 - how many times a day
24:10 - zero times a day
24:11 - [Laughter]
24:13 - it's one of those cool to it's cool to
24:15 - know how to do it but actually using it
24:17 - yeah i mean
24:18 - i i don't really use recursion too much
24:21 - i mean that the one time when i do find
24:23 - i actually need to use recursion
24:24 - it'll be super rare and then i would be
24:26 - like oh that's pretty cool i
24:28 - i use prevention that day like it's one
24:30 - of those things it's not it's definitely
24:31 - not an essential
24:32 - so i would actually focus on the
24:33 - fundamentals and then go ahead and jump
24:35 - into react
24:36 - and you can sort of have some fun yeah
24:39 - yeah i would say i would say
24:40 - recursion um things like that is that
24:42 - actually going to be very important
24:44 - when you guys get into interviewing with
24:45 - big companies like google and like
24:47 - facebook
24:48 - when you get into that zone you will
24:50 - have to know like algorithms you know
24:51 - recursion right
24:53 - you know um basically you know uh
24:55 - breadth first search depth first search
24:57 - binary surgeries all that stuff that you
25:00 - know
25:00 - i hate i don't like and that i don't use
25:03 - you're gonna still have to know that
25:05 - unfortunately for the
25:06 - for the interviews so yeah if you're
25:09 - gonna if your goal is to look at you
25:11 - know big companies
25:13 - you are going to have to learn it i'm
25:14 - sorry but you will
25:16 - you know especially for companies like
25:18 - google facebook and things like that
25:20 - but to be honest like i would very i'd
25:22 - really recommend because like even
25:23 - though i said you started with smaller
25:25 - startup companies and i did the same
25:26 - thing i started with
25:27 - smaller startup companies and then i
25:28 - ended up going the freelancing route and
25:30 - then i joined the team
25:31 - um so it really you really need to kind
25:33 - of decide as to like what's your sort of
25:35 - goal like if you do if your goal is to
25:37 - get into companies like google
25:39 - then i would recommend i would always
25:40 - kind of recommend just
25:42 - just like we said guys just stop just
25:45 - start get the fundamentals down
25:46 - to start getting those things ahead and
25:48 - then when you need to know those things
25:50 - start to address them then right like if
25:52 - you're going to apply to google
25:54 - know that yes you're probably going to
25:56 - need to know about like a bunch of
25:57 - different algorithms and efficient ways
25:59 - of doing things
26:00 - but before that a startup company that's
26:02 - getting off the ground that has a bit of
26:04 - funding
26:05 - isn't really going to be asking you
26:06 - about algorithms they just want to know
26:08 - can you help them build their product or
26:09 - not
26:10 - all right so and they're gonna be
26:11 - begging you they'll be begging you
26:12 - please help us
26:14 - yeah they'll be begging you and at that
26:15 - point they'll be like right like if you
26:16 - can start tomorrow like start tomorrow
26:18 - if you've got the skills to do it like
26:20 - so there's literally like that's the
26:22 - sort of conversations that you need to
26:23 - be focused about before those ones
26:24 - yeah um ashkan just dropped a really
26:27 - nice comment he goes i've joined the
26:28 - course a few days ago and i strongly
26:30 - recommend it to people who lost
26:31 - in tons of tutorials amazing stuff dude
26:34 - you'll thank me
26:35 - this is all you need better than boot
26:36 - camps amazing if you guys want to go and
26:38 - check the
26:39 - the course out link is in the
26:40 - description by the way nice
26:44 - love it love it i love seeing stuff guys
26:46 - wait who by the way drop in the comments
26:48 - below
26:48 - who has actually just got the course
26:51 - today i'm just curious
26:53 - if you actually in the court if you got
26:54 - the course today drop in the comments
26:56 - below i'm very curious
26:57 - yeah love to see that definitely would
26:59 - love to see that
27:00 - um okay this is an interesting one nice
27:03 - so stoichio
27:04 - says how you guys started programming
27:08 - so okay okay i'm gonna go first uh yeah
27:11 - i'll give it a go so
27:12 - when i was i started coding when i was
27:14 - 17
27:15 - i believe or 16 or 17. um i always found
27:18 - that the it class so like excel
27:20 - spreadsheets and things like that in
27:21 - school
27:22 - was just never challenging enough i kind
27:24 - of was naturally
27:25 - like enjoyed it so much but i wanted to
27:27 - like start to build things on my own
27:28 - accord and
27:29 - the first programming language that one
27:31 - of my teachers showed me was pascal
27:33 - now i really like sort of like yeah i
27:36 - couldn't invest out here
27:38 - like pascal was my first language and
27:40 - then i was like okay this is kind of
27:42 - cool like it's a bit challenging i like
27:43 - what you can do with this
27:45 - and then i literally bought a book off i
27:48 - had an ipad at the time like the first
27:49 - ever ipad and i bought a
27:51 - java book and i pretty much sat there
27:54 - went through that java book and i pretty
27:56 - much just
27:56 - i literally learned a fundamental about
27:59 - how to do something in java
28:00 - and i wrote a little loop and i
28:02 - basically made it loop ten times i made
28:03 - it
28:04 - 100 times and then i tried an if
28:06 - statement and i was like if this loop is
28:07 - on
28:08 - the 50th iteration don't show it like
28:10 - are you
28:11 - just making how many how many loops did
28:13 - you write sunny how many
28:15 - i went loop crazy i wrote so many loops
28:17 - and i just did so many weird things but
28:19 - like it helped me learn java
28:20 - and then i just took it and i ran with
28:23 - it like i built
28:24 - i reached out to one of my cousins who
28:26 - had a car shop right there the car
28:27 - manufacturing shop
28:28 - and i was like oh like you're currently
28:30 - using like a you just everything's paper
28:32 - based so i went ahead and i built them
28:34 - a java like a java interface like that
28:37 - like a
28:38 - nice like little ui and that had a sql
28:40 - backend and i basically
28:42 - so i took all the information so i
28:44 - actually ended up gathering like user
28:46 - stories
28:47 - from them without realizing at the time
28:50 - and
28:50 - i didn't know what user story was i
28:52 - didn't know what any of that stuff was i
28:53 - just kind of started
28:54 - asking what their requirements were and
28:56 - i just built them a system and the guys
28:58 - and that was the first time i realized
28:59 - like i kind of the way i looked it was i
29:02 - was like
29:02 - i've seen this done before like i've
29:04 - seen websites that do the similar things
29:06 - so i know it's possible
29:07 - so how do i get there and i just kept
29:09 - going with that and every time i wanted
29:10 - to do something i was like
29:11 - i know you can push data into a database
29:13 - i've seen it happen before but how do i
29:15 - get there
29:16 - and i just kept doing that before you
29:17 - know i had a full build and uh
29:20 - and yes that took a lot of frustration
29:22 - and several
29:23 - million hours that they had to compete
29:26 - but that got my journey started and then
29:28 - yeah like i just pretty much from that
29:30 - point on
29:31 - i did go to university wow i would say
29:34 - uh you don't need to like guys
29:36 - it's all about practical knowledge and
29:38 - sort of learning that way how about enos
29:41 - first thing actually before i continue
29:42 - with mine actually guys
29:44 - drop some fire in the comments because
29:46 - that was one heck of a story
29:48 - drop some fire in the comments for sunny
29:50 - because that was one heck of a story
29:52 - and especially my i would drop there's
29:55 - i would drop some fire for sunny for
29:58 - you him building making user stories
30:01 - because that shit's good
30:03 - yeah yeah i didn't even know what jesus
30:06 - story was for that man
30:10 - um but yeah like like for me basically
30:14 - i would say it's actually a very
30:14 - interesting story as well like i kind of
30:16 - started in high school so i think when i
30:18 - was like 16 years old 16 years old
30:20 - and and i started in high school right
30:22 - and
30:24 - and we had in high school we had one web
30:27 - design course so this is at the time i
30:28 - was still figuring out who who was gonna
30:30 - be like what i wanted to learn
30:31 - yeah and we had only one web design
30:33 - course this is a course that we use
30:34 - for dreamers so we use dreamweaver we
30:36 - are in this course yeah and we built
30:38 - some very basic html sites
30:41 - okay so i took the course initially
30:43 - enough i
30:44 - loved that course so much i just i love
30:46 - this idea of like
30:48 - you know taking this thing in your mind
30:50 - and this idea that you have like an idea
30:51 - in your mind and actually putting it to
30:53 - good use
30:54 - yeah like that was like blown
30:57 - like that blew my mind yeah you know
31:00 - like
31:00 - like yeah so like i love that part and i
31:03 - just kept doing it i kept doing i can't
31:04 - building size capability size with
31:06 - gmover
31:07 - i remember like this this course that i
31:09 - had this one course
31:10 - you're only allowed to take this course
31:12 - only once
31:13 - like only one semester yeah and that's
31:16 - it
31:17 - i'm like but i want to take more i want
31:20 - to do more
31:21 - so i literally i kept asking my teacher
31:23 - like what can i do what can i do
31:25 - can i retake this course again again
31:27 - again yeah and guess what
31:29 - yeah i can't retake it i kept retaking
31:31 - the exact same course
31:33 - every single semester
31:37 - for two straight years i just can't
31:38 - retake
31:40 - exactly the same because i wanted to at
31:42 - least be in this right
31:43 - i didn't want to just stop i literally
31:46 - want to be in this
31:47 - and i just kept retaking i kept retaking
31:49 - and basically the next thing you know
31:50 - next thing you know basically what i end
31:52 - up doing is like um
31:54 - and they initially enough i got to a
31:56 - point where like they didn't have any
31:57 - seats for me
31:58 - because i could not register for the
31:59 - course i had to register manually
32:01 - yeah and so what i ended up doing is i
32:03 - ended up buying myself a laptop
32:05 - yeah and they they had like a storage as
32:09 - like a locker room like a storage room
32:11 - right
32:12 - on the side and that's actually where i
32:15 - will learn so i will basically the
32:16 - beginning of the class i'll go into the
32:18 - storage room
32:18 - yeah i'll bring up my laptop and i would
32:20 - actually work and study from that laptop
32:22 - in the storage room
32:23 - really dude they we need to make a film
32:26 - about you that's
32:27 - that's crazy man holy crap
32:30 - yeah yeah so so and literally and like
32:33 - basically what i end up doing is like i
32:34 - end up helping helping the teacher i was
32:35 - the two teachers assistant
32:37 - you know building more websites and then
32:39 - final year
32:40 - my senior year and in high school guys
32:43 - my senior year in high school
32:44 - i decided to make to rebuild the
32:47 - school's website like the whole high
32:48 - school website i decided to rebuild it
32:50 - for fun
32:51 - like i didn't even tell my teacher i
32:53 - didn't even tell my teacher
32:54 - i just literally came in one day i'm
32:55 - like yeah so yeah i built the school's
32:58 - website you know i wanted to see how it
32:59 - looked like she's like
33:01 - what you did what
33:04 - what she loved it like she loved it
33:07 - and it got to a point where like
33:09 - basically i ended up basically
33:10 - working with another student and we made
33:12 - that site mobile friendly
33:14 - and together we rebuilt the whole
33:17 - school's website and that site was
33:19 - on the school's website for three years
33:21 - straight man damn bro oh
33:23 - we actually went up holy crap that's

35:00 - guys maybe maybe there's a face mask you
35:02 - know yeah i mean how did who knows right
35:05 - yeah you read everywhere let's have a
35:07 - look any more comments
35:09 - oh man this is good guys love the
35:11 - comments love it love your uh
35:13 - i love the fire they give you guys they
35:14 - gave you so much fun i love the fire
35:16 - yeah i love seeing that honestly
35:20 - i didn't know pascal was your first
35:21 - language i'm sorry i'm sorry son
35:23 - honestly i know man like i remember
35:26 - writing now i was like
35:27 - even like i can't remember i think like
35:30 - you thought like a semicolon was strict
35:32 - if you code in pascal
35:33 - like that is unforgiving and i i've
35:36 - coded in c
35:36 - plus plus and and like yeah i mean oh to
35:38 - be fair c
35:39 - plus is uh that's a that's an
35:42 - interesting language if anyone
35:44 - if any of you guys have coded in c plus
35:46 - plus let me know in the comments because
35:48 - that's uh that's a tricky language to
35:50 - get your head around yeah
35:53 - yeah no no no no that's one of those
35:57 - ones that you use it to get like uh i
35:59 - made this little embed little
36:00 - you know circuit boards i coded yeah of
36:03 - course the c
36:04 - plus plus on it right and it had like a
36:05 - motion sensor attached to it really
36:08 - and then when you walk in the room it
36:09 - just triggers a motion sensor
36:11 - and then through that little circuit
36:12 - board it's connected to the internet and
36:14 - it pings off a message
36:16 - to like something called a it's called
36:18 - an mqtt server right
36:20 - and then you just have it i had a little
36:22 - raspberry pi running python which you're
36:23 - just listening
36:24 - and then if it started listening it
36:26 - turned on the webcam and it started
36:27 - recording the room
36:29 - really so it's like basically like a
36:30 - live camera yeah yeah and i have the
36:32 - whole
36:34 - security camera yeah i had the whole
36:36 - thing required
36:38 - i won't do it now because on youtube but
36:40 - it's on a private youtube link so
36:42 - i send that to you afterwards it's crazy
36:45 - yeah really do it i want to see that i
36:48 - want to see that man
36:49 - yeah it was a university assignment so
36:51 - i'm definitely i look a bit
36:52 - different but it's a funny thing
36:56 - nice actually what if you can show it to
36:59 - everybody
36:59 - maybe drop the link for everybody to see
37:01 - yeah yeah i can drop that thing
37:12 - a video from like a few years ago to be
37:15 - fair i look very similar to how i
37:17 - i know a little bit slimmer in the face
37:23 - oh man so that's that's actually a
37:25 - really good question what should i be
37:26 - what should i um what should be my
37:29 - approach to become a full stack
37:31 - developer and a good competitive
37:32 - programmer i like that that's a good
37:34 - question
37:35 - yep so what should be on my approach to
37:37 - become a full-stack developer
37:38 - and a good competitive programmer um now
37:41 - do you got any insight for that
37:44 - um yeah i got an answer you wanna start
37:46 - this out
37:47 - start this out yeah so okay so for me a
37:49 - full stack developer so
37:50 - initially when i went into my first row
37:53 - i wasn't prepared to be honest
37:55 - for a full stack row i was more prepared
37:57 - for like i had done a bunch of back end
37:59 - developments so i was actually really
38:00 - weak on the front end
38:02 - so my background was java so i actually
38:04 - did a lot of stuff in java
38:06 - um but then they required full stack
38:08 - they required like you'd know java and
38:10 - you knew javascript and things like that
38:12 - and guys just if you get confused front
38:13 - end is what you're seeing on the website
38:15 - back end is what you typically have on
38:17 - the um
38:18 - on the sort of server stuff and um
38:21 - what i would recommend is just keep your
38:23 - like keep that mindset open at all times
38:26 - but what's really nice now guys is that
38:28 - if you learn something like javascript
38:30 - right
38:30 - you can use it for the front end and for
38:32 - the back end which is really cool
38:34 - right so like that full stacks problem
38:37 - that we used to face as to like
38:39 - oh i can use like web dev i can do like
38:41 - html css and javascript from the front
38:43 - end but my java is super weak
38:44 - that problems kind of got a little bit
38:46 - lifted now because you can code in
38:48 - javascript
38:49 - you have no js now for the back end um
38:52 - so you can
38:52 - transfer that knowledge and then while
38:54 - you're building your front end and
38:56 - you're sort of
38:56 - building your javascript skill set that
38:59 - can be transferred to the back end and
39:00 - then
39:01 - you vice versa like so you can sort of
39:03 - alleviate that now so what i would say
39:04 - is my approach here would be
39:06 - pick and stick with one language like we
39:08 - said earlier so
39:09 - in this case i would pick javascript and
39:12 - just
39:12 - really harness your skill set on that
39:15 - because you can actually become a really
39:16 - good full stack developer
39:18 - just with javascript yeah yeah
39:21 - sure that how about you know that
39:25 - yeah i would say i would say like the
39:27 - role path like the road map to kind of
39:28 - like becoming a full stack developer is
39:30 - that
39:30 - obviously guys right in the full stack
39:32 - developer what do you have
39:34 - you have the front end right which is
39:36 - what you see on the website that's the
39:37 - front
39:37 - guys and then you have the back end that
39:40 - is where the server
39:41 - logic be that's where all the server
39:43 - logic is so if you think of facebook
39:44 - okay i think of facebook facebook what
39:47 - has the front-end application that's
39:49 - what you see the back-end logic is
39:52 - where all your information is stored it
39:54 - is basically
39:55 - you know how you get information you
39:57 - know that's how basically your front end
39:59 - shows all the data you know shows the
40:00 - news feed it shows your pictures right
40:02 - it is because all of that and all the
40:04 - logic is actually saved on the server on
40:05 - the back inside and the backend api
40:08 - and if you want to learn basically both
40:11 - the front end and the backing which i
40:12 - highly recommend because both of us are
40:13 - full stack developers
40:14 - and it's actually very valuable
40:16 - knowledge uh to have and
40:18 - actually has got me you know a lot of
40:20 - great opportunities
40:21 - is like if you let's say if you're doing
40:24 - javascript okay
40:25 - if you're doing javascript okay and
40:27 - you're learning how to do frontend and
40:29 - you're learning for example react
40:30 - now try you do a node.js which by the
40:33 - way actually something we teach
40:34 - in profit or javascript we teach you
40:36 - guys how to become a full stack
40:37 - developer we teach you guys how to build
40:39 - apis
40:40 - using node.js okay so first you want to
40:43 - learn for example react to frontend and
40:44 - then you want to couple that with a
40:46 - backend
40:47 - which is for example like node.js and
40:49 - build apis with that
40:50 - so those are two parts if you want to go
40:52 - the route now
40:54 - another route you can go is you can be i
40:56 - can build reactor yes
40:58 - but i can also go the jingle route and
41:00 - actually build my back end with
41:02 - django okay with django as a back-end
41:05 - api
41:06 - now i would highly recommend for you
41:09 - just to make it simpler
41:10 - start do node.js okay build your backup
41:13 - with node.js if that if you started out
41:15 - with
41:16 - javascript if you start out with
41:17 - javascript i'd highly recommend
41:19 - try on node.js like literally guys so
41:21 - many companies use that you have no idea
41:23 - honestly one great example is netflix i
41:25 - don't know if you know
41:26 - but netflix actually actually used
41:28 - node.js for the whole backend api system
41:31 - oh nice all of their logic all their
41:33 - logic is built
41:34 - in node.js which is really cool awesome
41:37 - so
41:38 - exactly so hold on i just yeah so i
41:40 - literally was looking i was
41:41 - looking at that and i found it out i'm
41:42 - like holy [ __ ] that's cool you know nice
41:44 - but but yeah but like like if you're
41:47 - doing javascript
41:48 - you know learn javascript learn front
41:50 - end and then you know build the back end
41:52 - and then once you've got those two parts
41:55 - my friend
41:56 - you are sailing exactly you are sailing
42:00 - and that's pretty much it like you know
42:01 - there's not much more to it yes
42:03 - you just you you just there's not much
42:05 - to it you have to know both parts and
42:06 - that's it
42:07 - yeah and the more projects now you the
42:09 - more projects you now do with those bold
42:11 - parts the more experience you get with
42:12 - that
42:12 - like in profit the javascript for
42:14 - example we teach you how to build a blog
42:17 - with a front end and a back and use
42:19 - node.js we teach you how to
42:21 - a google maps store locator with a front
42:23 - end and a back end
42:24 - we teach you how to build a twitter
42:26 - clone with a front end and a back end
42:28 - we teach you how to also make how to
42:30 - also make a chrome extension with a
42:32 - front-end and a back-end so
42:34 - you can see a lot of the repetitiveness
42:36 - of front-end
42:37 - and the back-end which gets to full
42:39 - stack development
42:41 - yeah so yeah drop in the comments below
42:43 - who wants to become a full stock
42:44 - developer because i know you guys are
42:46 - who wants to come to the post a

44:04 - yeah
44:04 - nice yeah so um
44:07 - i actually i just saw a really good
44:09 - question but i've completely
44:11 - lost that uh if it comes back got some
44:13 - good questions we got some good
44:14 - questions out here man oh
44:16 - that's it right so nars actually just
44:18 - mentioned guys about
44:19 - netflix right and how netflix use uh uh
44:22 - node.js for the backend
44:23 - uh if you guys are always wondering and
44:25 - you've got like some kind of curiosity
44:26 - it's like
44:27 - how do you build netflix like the front
44:29 - end how do you build the back end
44:30 - guys we actually did that we did that i
44:32 - think it was like a few days ago oh yeah
44:34 - and uh so if you're going you can go
44:36 - ahead and right now you can go check out
44:38 - this link right here
44:39 - so um if you literally pause the video
44:41 - here if you go to this link
44:43 - right there at the top of the screen you
44:44 - can actually go ahead and see this and
44:46 - this is live and this is something we
44:47 - built
44:48 - and guys it's a complete fully
44:50 - functional working netflix app
44:52 - so we built this and this is built in
44:53 - react um so like just to go to show you
44:56 - sort of what you can build
44:58 - by harnessing and yeah like you can do
45:00 - all of this and
45:01 - guys like we said like this front end
45:03 - was built with react
45:05 - but the back end is also like you can
45:07 - have the whole backing powered in
45:08 - node.js
45:09 - so really really powerful stuff by just
45:11 - harnessing your skill set on on
45:13 - javascript
45:13 - he was telling us he was watching
45:14 - netflix with amberly the other day
45:17 - and he uh funny story happened so he was
45:20 - watching it
45:21 - and he had the netflix clone open on the
45:23 - right and the actual
45:25 - netflix opened on the left and he kept
45:26 - clicking it wondering why it wasn't
45:28 - opening the film
45:30 - and he was like oh my god i'm on the
45:32 - netflix club
45:33 - so uh i know the story so when you get
45:35 - those kind of problems you know you
45:36 - built a decent website
45:39 - that's good that is good stuff man oh my
45:41 - gosh
45:43 - that is good stuff awesome um
45:47 - right so best platform for mobile apps
45:49 - guys it's really good question here
45:51 - uh we can actually mention something
45:53 - here called react native so if you do
45:55 - let him react guys
45:57 - you can actually transfer all of that
45:59 - skill all of those skills over
46:00 - to something called react native which
46:02 - is whereby you pretty much code the same
46:04 - code base so you have react
46:07 - but it basically compiles so your code
46:10 - one code base
46:11 - gets like translated into two different
46:13 - co code sets so you've got
46:14 - like ios and an android app from one
46:17 - codebase which is really nice and i've
46:18 - coded in that before
46:20 - uh and actually interesting story so my
46:22 - first job that i went to
46:23 - i knew react i was in i barely knew
46:26 - react i kind of just got in there
46:28 - and they sort of learned on the fly but
46:30 - i had no exposure to react native but
46:32 - because i knew react you can pretty much
46:34 - pick up react native really quickly
46:36 - um so yeah so that if that was an answer
46:38 - to your question it's a really
46:40 - really nice way of doing it yeah
46:44 - um cool go ahead and see
46:47 - is it necessary is it necessary to learn
46:52 - javascript for web programming or
46:54 - learning django
46:55 - is enough uh
46:58 - what is that question uh
47:01 - let's see avinash avinash asked the
47:04 - question
47:06 - do you see it
47:10 - yeah oh yeah yeah there we go you got it
47:13 - okay
47:15 - so it isn't necessary to learn
47:17 - javascript
47:18 - for web programming or learning django
47:20 - is enough
47:22 - um what would you say to that sunny so
47:25 - personally i don't actually know django
47:28 - so i have not coded in django before um
47:31 - i've done
47:32 - i've done python work so i've done a lot
47:34 - of python coding um but not actually
47:36 - touched on django so not at all
47:38 - um is it like my my answer to this would
47:41 - be
47:42 - if you want to go into web development i
47:44 - would really recommend that yes you
47:46 - would probably need to know javascript
47:48 - because it's the
47:49 - main language around the web development
47:50 - space um
47:52 - and and like the whole sort of market
47:55 - share is going towards
47:57 - like sort of react right now as the most
48:00 - wanted
48:01 - library right now guys uh and it's
48:03 - powered
48:04 - by javascript um so i would really
48:07 - recommend
48:08 - it's not really a case of is it
48:10 - necessary it's kind of
48:11 - the whatever the market goes towards so
48:14 - if like react is popular now
48:16 - and then like let's say in a year's time
48:17 - or in two years time something else
48:19 - becomes popular
48:20 - like it probably will be based around
48:22 - javascript
48:23 - because javascript is getting more and
48:25 - more powerful um so i would recommend uh
48:28 - an answer to this pretty simply yes i
48:30 - would recommend that you do learn
48:31 - javascript
48:32 - um and if you currently know django then
48:35 - really cool like
48:36 - uh that's really really like it will
48:38 - actually give you a head start if
48:39 - anything because you're

Cleaned transcript:

now so like a hundred days of documentation right which means like documentary is the journey and amanat is really one of those people who does it right they do it he does it as you should because he's had days where he's been stuck on debugging he's been days on things have gone really well and he documents everything because that's the reality guys and that's actually what happens so whether it's instagram facebook youtube um and also this i really want to add up and add on to this right by just writing some content as whether it be like i don't know how to write a component in react whether it be like how to style something with flexbox by writing that out and by teaching someone else it you're going to actually reinforce your knowledge of it massively right and that's exactly the benefit exactly it's like it's like that um when you actually teach someone you actually learn much more than when you try to learn by yourself so when you try to teach someone you know a certain thing let's say you want to let's say that you know you want to post a an instagram post on you know react to basics right yeah you know you're going to learn the you know the really big fundamentals the very important amount because you know you got to teach that right you have to know that before you teach yeah and so that actually forces you to learn even better right so that's why you say like record your entire journey post things online i know ahmad is doing a great job right amanda for example he is from with all that he is doing he's also now getting coaching clients literally and is actually making money at that point so yeah crazy stuff seriously do it and trust me you were um i don't think you will not regret that yeah exactly our lovely comment by here he said sunny is going to inspire me thanks a lot bro because of you i'm not oh that's good thank you so much amanda and i really love your journey and keep doing what you're doing bro nice um uh we also want to add one more thing here guys uh it's not just about like sharing the journey right by doing that without realizing you're actually going to be building like your own personal brand okay so there's one thing working in a company there's one thing freelancing and doing this sort of stuff but if you just get involved and you start sharing your journey i promise you guys without even trying you're going to actually slowly build a bit of momentum and traction as to our following you're going to get a natural following of people who are interested in coding and interest and you're going to get like a more likeminded people sort of naturally start to surround you why this becomes really useful is because when you start growing your social media presence let's say you start offering coaching sessions and you want to have you want to start teaching people onetoone and you want to make a little bit of extra pocket money you just need to add one story on instagram and immediately you've got a thousand people that are gonna see that right and they're all coding people they're all like people in the developer community and i guarantee if you just get one person who replies to you that's potentially one person you can start teaching and you can start making that income from so it's not only going to benefit you in terms of learning it's actually another source of income so it's actually going to be a really powerful thing for you exactly exactly just there's so much opportunity guys seriously there's a ton of opportunity out there on social media online use it for your own good go out there put yourself out there right because the only way that people can see you is if you put yourself out there right and so if you do it you are more likely to get something back something like you know there's a there's a saying put good energy out and good energy will come back exactly i live in that right now and like nars is living there he's living breathing proof of this guys like if you go to one of his coaching course you come out of it feeling like you're about to wake up like it's crazy like it's like a rave in those coaching calls it's so we are dancing guys we are dancing those coaching calls by the way you like in description profile javascript linking by you check it out but literally we are dancing those coaching calls well and we have a dance party at the end of the coaching call obviously we get down to business which is a very important part but at the end of all those we have to have we have some fun you know we put getting put you know what we do right now is this crazy stuff you know what we do right now is we have this thing right now where basically we i put on a song and then we have we have to switch it up but one person will lead everybody else the move they have to do so let's say like like i'm doing this move everybody else will have to do this move for during the dance and then and then i put other people on the spotlight so basically we do rotation okay here you do it now you do it now and so everybody basically just gets to like lead the lead the whole uh leave the life that's cool dude i don't know how nars does it i finished my coaching course and i'm like exhausted and everyone's like where's our dance why aren't we dancing seriously yeah and i'm like god damn it okay let's start put somebody blow the track let's get it going it's so funny up in here you know yeah oh yeah that's too good man that's too good then yeah so guys if you found that useful make sure you let us know in the comment section and smash the thumbs up button uh we would love to just take some time out now to actually do a q a and let you guys just ask whatever questions you want to fire at us and guys feel free to ask whatever you want and we can just go ahead and pick them off right now how's that sound yeah let's go ahead get some questions and then we'll give you the answer you give us the questions and we'll hopefully give you the answers exactly just do that by the way by the way uh sunny there's a request here yeah i think sunny should dance by miraban so so sunny so sunny i'm gonna put you on the spot look how many likes are we at like if this video hits a certain number of likes then i'll do a dance no no no no no no don't make it out of this no no no that's not how it's gonna be that's my girlfriend's stirring trouble right there come on come on show us what you got come on well i i did let's do something let's go up oh roll it roll it guys i just can't compete like nas is a dancer my girlfriend's a dancer i'm a coda i i i swim around in my chair that's me oh that's so funny sunny you come to l.a i teach you how to dance no problem i'll tell you what i'll take you up on that now so we'll do that we'll do that okay okay okay okay i can actually i can do salsa oh no it looks like it's lagging i'll use an excuse oh man that is so funny oh man that was hilarious but seriously let's let's do some salsa nice you wanna do it you wanna do some salsa uh when i come to l.a we'll do some salsa oh i'm not like right now all right fine fine all right none of the time but anyways guys let's go ahead and answer some questions you know if you guys want you know if your question is you know let's let's get signed to dance that's a good question as well but but yeah let's see what questions will come up because like you know what one thing one thing i know is like uh oh somebody asked nakul asked i want to do you want to put in i was like i want to apply for react.js internship what strong part should i should i have like what strong suits should i have do you have issues the question really good question yeah so uh react.js internship what strong parts should i have so it's really good question thanks for asking that call i would recommend that you pretty much um understand so in react you have two types of uh two ways of writing components right you have class based class based and you have functional the first thing is i would recommend that you learn uh very very thoroughly how to use both right because that becomes an immediate valuable skill to have you can go into a company and you can say right even if the code base is class based and and the difference here guys is one is just the older way of writing things one is the newer way of writing things but the newer way is really nice but most code bases have the older way so a lot of companies actually pay you to come in and just go ahead and change everything to the new uh the new stuff without breaking things in between right so if you can do that then uh that's definitely a valuable skill so i would recommend learning about class based and functional and then i would go ahead and pick up all of the fundamentals like react hooks i would look at the react context api so um for many of you guys who haven't used react before this could sound like buzz words um but if you are looking at react then just get a pen and paper on these down so it's react context api react hooks um and once you know about react hooks i would look at something called redux and once you know redux yes you're at a point where you're pretty much ready to jump into your first position so once you overcome that pattern and if you guys do want to look at an example of redux yesterday's live build of amazon we actually cover that so go and check it out if you are interested yeah and i would also say react jsx right jsx yeah right that's the one right yeah reactive effect which is the way a way to to write html using using basically react using javascript basically using react that's another another big point i think yeah i think to learn yeah that's that's definitely that's actually quite an essential thing you need to understand how to use jsx yeah yeah and what is the css i forgot because i used to use css where i actually used i built i built css with javascript as well what is that that one called i forgot um oh so there's a few there's css is sas that you made no no no there's one was like react build i forgot about that style sheet anyways maybe i could bring up some later time yeah okay so um if you if you guys have any questions around that drop them in the comments because that's actually a really good question somebody actually said something um i tried to pin it okay yeah this one here vikrant seth said help so there are times when coding we feel like giving up in between what should we do at that time so nashville take that one yeah so actually a lot a lot of students will actually actually get this a lot from students um in terms of you know hey i don't kind of you know i feel i feel like i just can't do it um like my answer my answer to this is is honestly like i'm not trying to think kind of what to say in terms of like you know to actually give you some actionable things to do um one thing one thing i would say is this is not an actual one but like one is don't put so much pressure on yourself like why are you putting so much pressure on yourself that you know because the reason why you don't feel like you know you feel like giving up is because you put so much pressure and you know on building something or you put so much pressure that you need to understand something so quickly that now you feel like well you know i can't really get it that fast and so now should i even learn it at that point right yeah but if you don't put too much pressure and you make it so much more about hey this is a fun thing to do let me see how i can learn it and let me put myself to the challenge to actually try and get it okay if you think of it more so it's just a fun thing that i'm going to learn instead of putting so much pressure i have to know this i have to get this to get a job and everything then it becomes a lot harder yeah but if you are stuck in that position where you know what i feel like i feel like giving up one release yourself of that pressure two two find um like i said find may potentially find a actually here's one thing that i would say is find small wins yeah because wins give you confidence so for example let's say actually i would recommend this situation do like a small youtube tutorial for example okay and code along with that person maybe join a course like part of a javascript link in the description join the course for example right and start getting small wins okay maybe it's you built a small program maybe you built a small you know uh card for example maybe you build a small a small like a weather weather application right anything that gives you like a win like sparks interest it's like hey i got this let me get let me see what else i can get i got this let me see what else i can get and by giving yourself momentum right by giving him this momentum you can basically br you can basically go a lot further and now use the momentum basically just keep going and keep going and keep going so that is kind of like i said i would say my answer to that yeah what about you really really nice like how you put that um i would say like perseverance guys for me is is gonna be the number one key thing because like in coding like that you you are i'm just like i'm gonna put it out there you are going to hit some really tough times where you will be at your computer for hours like you will be stuck at your company of hours and it doesn't matter if it's like a very simple error or like a really sort of complicated era like i've been stuck on my computer sometimes for the most basic things guys i've probably spent like eight hours once like figuring out like how to loop through an array properly right like i said and i was like oh my god like and now you'd see me like and this is what i want to really sort of like kind of draw a straight line over is that you're going to see me now in tutorials and like nars coding and you're going to be like wow they just seem to like know everything they know how to write all their code but like guys that's after going through like god knows how many hours of like sitting there banging our heads against the keyboard like like oh my god i want to quit i want to give up i'm not built out for this like it's a normal feeling and the number one thing i will say is just keep on moving forward like keep on going like don't just do not quit because i guarantee and this is why i love coding so much that rush that you get when you overcome that problem finally at the end that rush is unlike anything else like i to be honest i'm yet to find something which matches it like when i'm sat there bugging for like eight hours and i finally get my code working and then you deploy it and you do all your stuff and then you can go about a day it just sets you off from such a good mood and it's like the best i know yeah it's like it's like you realize oh man i missed a semicolon and that took you about eight hours to figure out yeah like at one point you're like really mad but you're also like hell yeah yeah exactly like in the beginning you're kind of like in this this weird place of like i'm really angry and disappointed with myself but i'm also like the most happiest i've ever been yeah yeah there's a lot and i think there's a very big joy i get personally like from building like a project like like like right now for example guys like really cool project that we're building right now with students actually check this out hold on maybe i can send you a link hold on hold on maybe you can actually share this let me see um we're building kobe tracker guys we are building a covey tracker and it's actually me and sunny are going to be doing by the way this is like a really cool announcement me and son are going to be doing a cover tracker building a cover tracker with react next monday next monday so drop in the comment below if would be excited to build something like this because it's something that's completely new right it's going to look amazing it might actually look something like this so actually let me see let me let me give you a link that you can probably show to them as well yeah uh so guys let us know in the comments while nars is finding that if you're excited to build a covert tracker uh it looks amazing this app looks really nice and we're going to show you how to build it and this is a complete beginner tutorial guys so it doesn't matter if you don't know how to code you can go along with us and you can build this as well and you can add it to your portfolio so okay go ahead right let me open this up for you guys so we've got no here we go so this is something that currently our students are building right in the profit of javascript so again if you want to build something like this and know that deep down on how to build this in the live coaching call so for example with me and sunny right we get to ask questions link is in the body make sure you profit with javascript you will not regret it yeah so here we have it guys um we have the covid 19 tracker so you can see like we can select countries from the drop down so if i go ahead and click this well you refresh it you're refreshing refresh it hold on okay refresh it start amazing and you're just not showing the actual case there we go there we go so hold on is it it's still not no i mean it might just be a delay i think my could be the internet connection is it working on your machine guys yeah yeah yeah interesting maybe uh sort of like but what you basically can do guys is you can you can select from this drop down you'll be able to select like the united states or the uk and it will show you not only it will show you like a live breakdown of country by country with your number of covert cases but it would also zoom into the map dynamically so imagine like it would literally zoom into the map at different points highlight the uk with this really nice circle illustration of depending on how many people have been infected with uh coronavirus and it will show you like stats of that thing and you can basically from this drop down click like international and this map reacts dynamically to that so it's going to be a really really nice build and again you guys will be able to add this to your portfolio so let us know in the comments if you find that exciting and if you are ready to do that and we will build that for you guys on monday can you open this up in safari try this up in safari actually yeah let's give that a go yeah let's try it i'm very curious why it's not showing up the cases on your side this will be interesting let's have a look um no let's go ahead and check if there's any errors coming back see guys this is this is the magic of coding guys there you go jquery is on jquery is is not different it's not defined interesting um oh maybe the shot oh maybe because it's very location based because i'm getting there's a cdn that's getting jquery okay all right okay okay oh nice yeah javascript yeah guys if you haven't already check this out make sure that you guys go ahead and check the link in the description uh if you've enjoyed the video so far and you found that some of the advice that we gave you is pretty useful then you can go ahead and check out this is pretty much where me and nars live we live inside of the community and guys we own this course yeah we live here like very much inside of this course like we offer a bunch of so not only do you get personalized video feedback from all of the homework submissions that nas sets every week in your coaching course so you get live feedback you get success coaches you get weekly javascript and react training calls so that's all of the javascript fundamentals and pretty much from a to z in javascript with nars and with me you'll be building uh fun little react apps that we can pretty much go in and and guys like when you build these apps you pretty much have like you can message me on slack you can come and show me your code i love to see what you guys build and yeah you can message us through slack and also guys these are it's all cool knowing how to learn how to code in javascript right but the main thing we want to do is show you how to make a killing with that through those skills yeah we're going to show you how to go from um being able because like this is the problem i find in most of these tutorials they teach you how to do stuff but they don't actually teach you how to actually go ahead and make some money with it right so we have plenty of different methods and our students are actually making a fair amount of money a lot of the students right now which is really nice like i love seeing um when students share their success stories with us um so yeah if you do want to go ahead and like you can just come check this page out it's in the link in the description and you guys can go and check that out for yourself awesome yeah check it out if you're interested if you by the way we do have it we have a 30 day money back so if you don't like it return it but you know i think i like it in either case trust me just yeah yeah you're going to like it just just trust me just trust us exactly nice um let's have a look at some of these uh things uh comments so we've got i spent a week okay so devin gray devin grey actually joined the other day so he's new to the course i believe um so he said i was a week trying to deploy my website to a server wondering why i can see it my euro only to find out my website was pointing to the wrong url yeah and then he and then he said he added another one he goes i was laughing at 4 am from happiness when i finally oh man the happiness you probably got this is it's so good yeah exactly like it's really gonna take you like it makes you so happy guys let's have a look um oh no this one might be good for you like uh so what are the best ways of flying or finding uh clients for your product so yeah i think we'll answer this in the way of finding clients um for like uh freelance projects yeah yeah so i think i think that in terms of finding clients for your freelance projects and i've done freelancing for a year the number one thing that i would say is honestly probably when you're first starting out it is through people that you know like you'd be surprised like how big your network is like what i would say and this is pretty much how i started is i literally started asking people like that i know hey do you know anybody who needs some work done hey do you need anybody who needs some freelance client work okay and the reason why the reason why you ask that question you basically you ask around for the people you know is because it's the trust factor yeah you're a lot more likely to get a job if someone trusts you versus if you're like hey i don't know who this guy is i'm not gonna i'm not gonna pay him right so the biggest thing in freelancing guys is honestly trust like that that is what that is basically if i if there's someone who you know there's someone who i know okay who maybe is a bit more expensive okay versus someone who i don't know but it's actually cheaper i'm gonna go with someone who i know yeah right so trust is a big fight so the first way is to find is through people you know that's part one part two is you can go on on websites like freelancer.com and upload.com and you can find them there but most important thing is build that connection build that network go to meetups see other people that is how you're going to get your freelance clients so yeah that is going to be my answer for that items honestly yeah and that's so powerful and i said because like guys like i thought initially there would be websites i'd have to go to but the truth is when i started freelancing it was all through word of mouth like everything was through word of mouth and i was like whoa like it was just somebody would randomly give me a call and say like oh hey you know so and so and i know that you can code and you can do stuff and i'll be like oh yeah sure like i can take this on let's have a look and you just start a conversation and before you know it like things are happening and you start working on these projects so like no i said go to these meetups go to these conferences and sort of be a part of these groups and communities and you will naturally start to see those conversations start to come about exactly exactly yeah awesome let's have a look at some more questions um right somebody said there's something said do i have to learn javascript in depth like recursion a lot all like to get a job and react uh do you see that yeah yeah so this one right here so ajinkya said do i have to learn javascript in depth like like recursion and look okay so good question so honestly recursion not necessarily is it a a valuable skill to have yes is a valuable skill to have i mean like it's cool to know how often do i actually use recursion i mean that's how often do you use recursion like clearly i use recursion you know how many times a day zero times a day [Laughter] it's one of those cool to it's cool to know how to do it but actually using it yeah i mean i i don't really use recursion too much i mean that the one time when i do find i actually need to use recursion it'll be super rare and then i would be like oh that's pretty cool i i use prevention that day like it's one of those things it's not it's definitely not an essential so i would actually focus on the fundamentals and then go ahead and jump into react and you can sort of have some fun yeah yeah i would say i would say recursion um things like that is that actually going to be very important when you guys get into interviewing with big companies like google and like facebook when you get into that zone you will have to know like algorithms you know recursion right you know um basically you know uh breadth first search depth first search binary surgeries all that stuff that you know i hate i don't like and that i don't use you're gonna still have to know that unfortunately for the for the interviews so yeah if you're gonna if your goal is to look at you know big companies you are going to have to learn it i'm sorry but you will you know especially for companies like google facebook and things like that but to be honest like i would very i'd really recommend because like even though i said you started with smaller startup companies and i did the same thing i started with smaller startup companies and then i ended up going the freelancing route and then i joined the team um so it really you really need to kind of decide as to like what's your sort of goal like if you do if your goal is to get into companies like google then i would recommend i would always kind of recommend just just like we said guys just stop just start get the fundamentals down to start getting those things ahead and then when you need to know those things start to address them then right like if you're going to apply to google know that yes you're probably going to need to know about like a bunch of different algorithms and efficient ways of doing things but before that a startup company that's getting off the ground that has a bit of funding isn't really going to be asking you about algorithms they just want to know can you help them build their product or not all right so and they're gonna be begging you they'll be begging you please help us yeah they'll be begging you and at that point they'll be like right like if you can start tomorrow like start tomorrow if you've got the skills to do it like so there's literally like that's the sort of conversations that you need to be focused about before those ones yeah um ashkan just dropped a really nice comment he goes i've joined the course a few days ago and i strongly recommend it to people who lost in tons of tutorials amazing stuff dude you'll thank me this is all you need better than boot camps amazing if you guys want to go and check the the course out link is in the description by the way nice love it love it i love seeing stuff guys wait who by the way drop in the comments below who has actually just got the course today i'm just curious if you actually in the court if you got the course today drop in the comments below i'm very curious yeah love to see that definitely would love to see that um okay this is an interesting one nice so stoichio says how you guys started programming so okay okay i'm gonna go first uh yeah i'll give it a go so when i was i started coding when i was 17 i believe or 16 or 17. um i always found that the it class so like excel spreadsheets and things like that in school was just never challenging enough i kind of was naturally like enjoyed it so much but i wanted to like start to build things on my own accord and the first programming language that one of my teachers showed me was pascal now i really like sort of like yeah i couldn't invest out here like pascal was my first language and then i was like okay this is kind of cool like it's a bit challenging i like what you can do with this and then i literally bought a book off i had an ipad at the time like the first ever ipad and i bought a java book and i pretty much sat there went through that java book and i pretty much just i literally learned a fundamental about how to do something in java and i wrote a little loop and i basically made it loop ten times i made it 100 times and then i tried an if statement and i was like if this loop is on the 50th iteration don't show it like are you just making how many how many loops did you write sunny how many i went loop crazy i wrote so many loops and i just did so many weird things but like it helped me learn java and then i just took it and i ran with it like i built i reached out to one of my cousins who had a car shop right there the car manufacturing shop and i was like oh like you're currently using like a you just everything's paper based so i went ahead and i built them a java like a java interface like that like a nice like little ui and that had a sql backend and i basically so i took all the information so i actually ended up gathering like user stories from them without realizing at the time and i didn't know what user story was i didn't know what any of that stuff was i just kind of started asking what their requirements were and i just built them a system and the guys and that was the first time i realized like i kind of the way i looked it was i was like i've seen this done before like i've seen websites that do the similar things so i know it's possible so how do i get there and i just kept going with that and every time i wanted to do something i was like i know you can push data into a database i've seen it happen before but how do i get there and i just kept doing that before you know i had a full build and uh and yes that took a lot of frustration and several million hours that they had to compete but that got my journey started and then yeah like i just pretty much from that point on i did go to university wow i would say uh you don't need to like guys it's all about practical knowledge and sort of learning that way how about enos first thing actually before i continue with mine actually guys drop some fire in the comments because that was one heck of a story drop some fire in the comments for sunny because that was one heck of a story and especially my i would drop there's i would drop some fire for sunny for you him building making user stories because that shit's good yeah yeah i didn't even know what jesus story was for that man um but yeah like like for me basically i would say it's actually a very interesting story as well like i kind of started in high school so i think when i was like 16 years old 16 years old and and i started in high school right and and we had in high school we had one web design course so this is at the time i was still figuring out who who was gonna be like what i wanted to learn yeah and we had only one web design course this is a course that we use for dreamers so we use dreamweaver we are in this course yeah and we built some very basic html sites okay so i took the course initially enough i loved that course so much i just i love this idea of like you know taking this thing in your mind and this idea that you have like an idea in your mind and actually putting it to good use yeah like that was like blown like that blew my mind yeah you know like like yeah so like i love that part and i just kept doing it i kept doing i can't building size capability size with gmover i remember like this this course that i had this one course you're only allowed to take this course only once like only one semester yeah and that's it i'm like but i want to take more i want to do more so i literally i kept asking my teacher like what can i do what can i do can i retake this course again again again yeah and guess what yeah i can't retake it i kept retaking the exact same course every single semester for two straight years i just can't retake exactly the same because i wanted to at least be in this right i didn't want to just stop i literally want to be in this and i just kept retaking i kept retaking and basically the next thing you know next thing you know basically what i end up doing is like um and they initially enough i got to a point where like they didn't have any seats for me because i could not register for the course i had to register manually yeah and so what i ended up doing is i ended up buying myself a laptop yeah and they they had like a storage as like a locker room like a storage room right on the side and that's actually where i will learn so i will basically the beginning of the class i'll go into the storage room yeah i'll bring up my laptop and i would actually work and study from that laptop in the storage room really dude they we need to make a film about you that's that's crazy man holy crap yeah yeah so so and literally and like basically what i end up doing is like i end up helping helping the teacher i was the two teachers assistant you know building more websites and then final year my senior year and in high school guys my senior year in high school i decided to make to rebuild the school's website like the whole high school website i decided to rebuild it for fun like i didn't even tell my teacher i didn't even tell my teacher i just literally came in one day i'm like yeah so yeah i built the school's website you know i wanted to see how it looked like she's like what you did what what she loved it like she loved it and it got to a point where like basically i ended up basically working with another student and we made that site mobile friendly and together we rebuilt the whole school's website and that site was on the school's website for three years straight man damn bro oh we actually went up holy crap that's amazing oh my god that's so cool and i got coupon code and i got a coupon for buffalo and i know you love coupons sonny so guys if you're wondering why now i said that so before the the the sort of software that we're using to stream this right now i went ahead and bought the prophet like the pro version right and i was like yo nas have you got a coupon code for this right now and he was just cracking up because guys i mean it doesn't matter how much you make if you can use a coupon code use the coupon code we should be sponsored by honey you know that extension you know right that's an amazing story nars and honestly guys if you found that super cool let nas know in the comments because that is amazing man how like you can actually have your own like creation on your school website that's so sad yeah that was really nice that was that was super cool yeah and like the basically got congratulated by by i was actually i almost i almost got detention it almost got suspended from school but that suspension turned into into getting it shaky like the coupon code it was weird it was like and then the principal liked it just like it was weird man but it was good it was good that's crazy and uh tarik said a very nice king nas and saying the same time oh that's wicked thank you very much frank the bunny says you can't fool me that's not cozy yeah we maybe we are kazzy maybe we are kind of maybe guys maybe maybe there's a face mask you know yeah i mean how did who knows right yeah you read everywhere let's have a look any more comments oh man this is good guys love the comments love it love your uh i love the fire they give you guys they gave you so much fun i love the fire yeah i love seeing that honestly i didn't know pascal was your first language i'm sorry i'm sorry son honestly i know man like i remember writing now i was like even like i can't remember i think like you thought like a semicolon was strict if you code in pascal like that is unforgiving and i i've coded in c plus plus and and like yeah i mean oh to be fair c plus is uh that's a that's an interesting language if anyone if any of you guys have coded in c plus plus let me know in the comments because that's uh that's a tricky language to get your head around yeah yeah no no no no that's one of those ones that you use it to get like uh i made this little embed little you know circuit boards i coded yeah of course the c plus plus on it right and it had like a motion sensor attached to it really and then when you walk in the room it just triggers a motion sensor and then through that little circuit board it's connected to the internet and it pings off a message to like something called a it's called an mqtt server right and then you just have it i had a little raspberry pi running python which you're just listening and then if it started listening it turned on the webcam and it started recording the room really so it's like basically like a live camera yeah yeah and i have the whole security camera yeah i had the whole thing required i won't do it now because on youtube but it's on a private youtube link so i send that to you afterwards it's crazy yeah really do it i want to see that i want to see that man yeah it was a university assignment so i'm definitely i look a bit different but it's a funny thing nice actually what if you can show it to everybody maybe drop the link for everybody to see yeah yeah i can drop that thing a video from like a few years ago to be fair i look very similar to how i i know a little bit slimmer in the face oh man so that's that's actually a really good question what should i be what should i um what should be my approach to become a full stack developer and a good competitive programmer i like that that's a good question yep so what should be on my approach to become a fullstack developer and a good competitive programmer um now do you got any insight for that um yeah i got an answer you wanna start this out start this out yeah so okay so for me a full stack developer so initially when i went into my first row i wasn't prepared to be honest for a full stack row i was more prepared for like i had done a bunch of back end developments so i was actually really weak on the front end so my background was java so i actually did a lot of stuff in java um but then they required full stack they required like you'd know java and you knew javascript and things like that and guys just if you get confused front end is what you're seeing on the website back end is what you typically have on the um on the sort of server stuff and um what i would recommend is just keep your like keep that mindset open at all times but what's really nice now guys is that if you learn something like javascript right you can use it for the front end and for the back end which is really cool right so like that full stacks problem that we used to face as to like oh i can use like web dev i can do like html css and javascript from the front end but my java is super weak that problems kind of got a little bit lifted now because you can code in javascript you have no js now for the back end um so you can transfer that knowledge and then while you're building your front end and you're sort of building your javascript skill set that can be transferred to the back end and then you vice versa like so you can sort of alleviate that now so what i would say is my approach here would be pick and stick with one language like we said earlier so in this case i would pick javascript and just really harness your skill set on that because you can actually become a really good full stack developer just with javascript yeah yeah sure that how about you know that yeah i would say i would say like the role path like the road map to kind of like becoming a full stack developer is that obviously guys right in the full stack developer what do you have you have the front end right which is what you see on the website that's the front guys and then you have the back end that is where the server logic be that's where all the server logic is so if you think of facebook okay i think of facebook facebook what has the frontend application that's what you see the backend logic is where all your information is stored it is basically you know how you get information you know that's how basically your front end shows all the data you know shows the news feed it shows your pictures right it is because all of that and all the logic is actually saved on the server on the back inside and the backend api and if you want to learn basically both the front end and the backing which i highly recommend because both of us are full stack developers and it's actually very valuable knowledge uh to have and actually has got me you know a lot of great opportunities is like if you let's say if you're doing javascript okay if you're doing javascript okay and you're learning how to do frontend and you're learning for example react now try you do a node.js which by the way actually something we teach in profit or javascript we teach you guys how to become a full stack developer we teach you guys how to build apis using node.js okay so first you want to learn for example react to frontend and then you want to couple that with a backend which is for example like node.js and build apis with that so those are two parts if you want to go the route now another route you can go is you can be i can build reactor yes but i can also go the jingle route and actually build my back end with django okay with django as a backend api now i would highly recommend for you just to make it simpler start do node.js okay build your backup with node.js if that if you started out with javascript if you start out with javascript i'd highly recommend try on node.js like literally guys so many companies use that you have no idea honestly one great example is netflix i don't know if you know but netflix actually actually used node.js for the whole backend api system oh nice all of their logic all their logic is built in node.js which is really cool awesome so exactly so hold on i just yeah so i literally was looking i was looking at that and i found it out i'm like holy [ __ ] that's cool you know nice but but yeah but like like if you're doing javascript you know learn javascript learn front end and then you know build the back end and then once you've got those two parts my friend you are sailing exactly you are sailing and that's pretty much it like you know there's not much more to it yes you just you you just there's not much to it you have to know both parts and that's it yeah and the more projects now you the more projects you now do with those bold parts the more experience you get with that like in profit the javascript for example we teach you how to build a blog with a front end and a back and use node.js we teach you how to a google maps store locator with a front end and a back end we teach you how to build a twitter clone with a front end and a back end we teach you how to also make how to also make a chrome extension with a frontend and a backend so you can see a lot of the repetitiveness of frontend and the backend which gets to full stack development yeah so yeah drop in the comments below who wants to become a full stock developer because i know you guys are who wants to come to the post a developer also if you want to become a foster developer what are you still doing here join profit javascript you're not you don't want to miss out on that trust me exactly and for those of you guys who are a bit confused as to like how do you join you just go ahead and you just go ahead and tap that button right there after clicking the link in the description and it will take you to the next step to join the course um and also guys just worth mentioning we do have a 30 30day moneyback guarantee so there's actually nothing to lose here guys like just join it give it a month and on the 29th day you can cancel it if you're not happy with it you can completely just go ahead get your money back and it's as simple as that like literally you can do that and you have lost nothing and if anything you've got 29 days worth of free training right there so i would like at this point i i mean like if you haven't already check that out go ahead and click the link and and give that a try yeah and i guarantee once you're in there we like you'll see just how much value is actually given and it's just on yeah guys yeah yeah and even if like i said like if you don't like it you can always just refund it 30 days money back guarantee you know while you're in there you have the coaching call so you can pretty much just learn from us during those 30 days but i would you know you're going to be you're going to want to go more than 30 days trust me that's just like that's not even a question but anyways yeah nice yeah so um i actually i just saw a really good question but i've completely lost that uh if it comes back got some good questions we got some good questions out here man oh that's it right so nars actually just mentioned guys about netflix right and how netflix use uh uh node.js for the backend uh if you guys are always wondering and you've got like some kind of curiosity it's like how do you build netflix like the front end how do you build the back end guys we actually did that we did that i think it was like a few days ago oh yeah and uh so if you're going you can go ahead and right now you can go check out this link right here so um if you literally pause the video here if you go to this link right there at the top of the screen you can actually go ahead and see this and this is live and this is something we built and guys it's a complete fully functional working netflix app so we built this and this is built in react um so like just to go to show you sort of what you can build by harnessing and yeah like you can do all of this and guys like we said like this front end was built with react but the back end is also like you can have the whole backing powered in node.js so really really powerful stuff by just harnessing your skill set on on javascript he was telling us he was watching netflix with amberly the other day and he uh funny story happened so he was watching it and he had the netflix clone open on the right and the actual netflix opened on the left and he kept clicking it wondering why it wasn't opening the film and he was like oh my god i'm on the netflix club so uh i know the story so when you get those kind of problems you know you built a decent website that's good that is good stuff man oh my gosh that is good stuff awesome um right so best platform for mobile apps guys it's really good question here uh we can actually mention something here called react native so if you do let him react guys you can actually transfer all of that skill all of those skills over to something called react native which is whereby you pretty much code the same code base so you have react but it basically compiles so your code one code base gets like translated into two different co code sets so you've got like ios and an android app from one codebase which is really nice and i've coded in that before uh and actually interesting story so my first job that i went to i knew react i was in i barely knew react i kind of just got in there and they sort of learned on the fly but i had no exposure to react native but because i knew react you can pretty much pick up react native really quickly um so yeah so that if that was an answer to your question it's a really really nice way of doing it yeah um cool go ahead and see is it necessary is it necessary to learn javascript for web programming or learning django is enough uh what is that question uh let's see avinash avinash asked the question do you see it yeah oh yeah yeah there we go you got it okay so it isn't necessary to learn javascript for web programming or learning django is enough um what would you say to that sunny so personally i don't actually know django so i have not coded in django before um i've done i've done python work so i've done a lot of python coding um but not actually touched on django so not at all um is it like my my answer to this would be if you want to go into web development i would really recommend that yes you would probably need to know javascript because it's the main language around the web development space um and and like the whole sort of market share is going towards like sort of react right now as the most wanted library right now guys uh and it's powered by javascript um so i would really recommend it's not really a case of is it necessary it's kind of the whatever the market goes towards so if like react is popular now and then like let's say in a year's time or in two years time something else becomes popular like it probably will be based around javascript because javascript is getting more and more powerful um so i would recommend uh an answer to this pretty simply yes i would recommend that you do learn javascript um and if you currently know django then really cool like uh that's really really like it will actually give you a head start if anything because you're
