00:00 - the biggest difference between somebody
00:03 - who is just doing a job and trying to
00:06 - run a company or create our channel like
00:09 - YouTube or whatever you guys know what
00:13 - it is now the biggest difference is your
00:20 - tolerance to ambiguity okay your
00:25 - tolerance to ambiguity and how much can
00:29 - you handle not knowing that's what
00:33 - defines an entrepreneur versus somebody
00:36 - who's just doing a job okay and you can
00:39 - be entrepreneur even doing a job for
00:42 - example if you're a Python developer you
00:44 - can be an entrepreneur and you can be
00:46 - getting different clients and who you're
00:47 - working with you can land jobs not just
00:50 - by sitting and sending resumes maybe you
00:53 - can start networking with people around
00:54 - you there are a lot of ways to be an
00:56 - entrepreneur but again it's a lot about
00:59 - handling that uncertainty and how do you
01:02 - deal with it you have this feeling in
01:04 - your stomach like you're gonna puke not
01:07 - knowing or can you be like this is okay
01:11 - I'm gonna find out what the road is
01:14 - ahead I'm gonna plan something out I'm
01:16 - gonna have a vision and I'm gonna trust
01:17 - my instincts okay so it's a lot of that
01:20 - you know I failed multiple businesses I
01:22 - used to have a channel called chest a
01:23 - steak that has like 150 subs it's dead
01:26 - now go look at it
01:27 - bye I started other things other YouTube
01:31 - videos right remember we would make so
01:33 - many YouTube videos we were trying to do
01:35 - this Hostgator affiliate marketing stuff
01:37 - so many we would literally spend hours
01:39 - upon hours we've spent weeks recording
01:42 - these videos scripting it out trying to
01:44 - make this business how many businesses
01:46 - have we gone through we started Amazon
01:47 - FBA business we started quantum boroughs
01:52 - we started developer products which was
01:55 - about like launching products we reached
01:59 - out to like so many manufacturers in
02:01 - China and built all these relationships
02:03 - only to not lead anywhere and fail but
02:06 - those failures other people see and they
02:09 - go to take a sip of their they go
02:12 - told you so yeah right to take a sip of
02:15 - their little told you soap
02:17 - whereas for us it's a learning
02:20 - experience and kind of battle scars so
02:24 - to speak without those you don't like we
02:28 - won't be here this channel wouldn't be
02:30 - here those references yeah you have to
02:32 - get those references without them you
02:33 - don't really know where you're going and
02:35 - I mean great like they didn't build the
02:39 - platform like chess Tasik and failed but
02:42 - that's the difference between let's say
02:43 - me and somebody else or maybe you know
02:46 - maybe you and somebody else right
02:48 - maybe you both were let's say thirty at
02:51 - some point and then you became thirty
02:53 - one Dave went from being thirty to
02:55 - thirty one without failing and you went
02:57 - from thirty thirty one while failing a
02:59 - few things okay and there's a lot of
03:01 - honor in failure failure is the only way
03:05 - to proceed forward when you go to the
03:07 - gym and if you're picking up five pound
03:08 - dumbbells and curling with them you're
03:12 - never gonna be failing so that's great
03:14 - but are you gonna be making any progress
03:16 - there's gonna be zero progress that
03:19 - you're gonna be making okay so failure
03:22 - is actually your indicator that you're
03:26 - going in the right direction I'm gonna
03:29 - say it again
03:29 - failure is your indicator that you're
03:32 - going in the right direction okay
03:35 - failure is your GPS in life failure and
03:38 - feeder is your GPS in life not Google
03:41 - Maps not ways not Apple Maps not
03:46 - whatever other maps that exist
03:47 - definitely not Apple Maps even though I
03:50 - love Apple they just didn't do a very
03:52 - good job with that freaking app failure
03:54 - and fear is your navigation in life all
03:59 - right as long as you can stand making
04:02 - yourself uncomfortable you're growing
04:04 - when you're very comfortable where you
04:07 - are you are not growing not growing is
04:10 - not wrong but not growing is not making
04:13 - progress if you're okay with that
04:16 - good for you I'm not okay with that my
04:20 - friend is not okay with that
04:21 - my other friend is not okay with that
04:24 - we're okay with going with sleepless
04:26 - nights I bags and all kinds of crazy
04:31 - stuff question is are you if you do want
04:34 - all those results and things that you
04:37 - say you want and the lifestyle that you
04:39 - say you want and the job that you say
04:42 - you want and the impact that you want to
04:44 - make on this world that you say you want
04:47 - why aren't you willing to put in the
04:50 - work that gets you those things do you
04:53 - know it's as easy being exactly where
04:55 - you are as it is going towards your
04:58 - goals in the directions you want to go
05:00 - to it takes the same amount of work as
05:02 - being lazy as it takes to be successful
05:05 - okay
05:07 - lazy person has to go through making
05:10 - these excruciatingly excuses every
05:13 - single goddamn day they go I couldn't do
05:17 - this because I'm busy I couldn't do this
05:20 - because I had all these other tasks and
05:23 - obligations I couldn't go to the gym and
05:25 - make myself look and feel better because
05:27 - I don't know I had to pick up my kids
05:30 - right I couldn't put in this extra work
05:33 - I couldn't update my portfolio I
05:36 - couldn't upgrade my LinkedIn I couldn't
05:39 - I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't I
05:40 - couldn't and is just as giant barrage of
05:44 - excuses and when this are sitting there
05:46 - looking you dead and I telling you this
05:48 - you know they're bullshitting you and
05:52 - actually them to know that they're lying
05:54 - you both know but you make this non
05:58 - verbal agreement with your eyes that
06:01 - you're just gonna both agree to look the
06:03 - other way make each other feel
06:05 - comfortable where you are you're not fat
06:09 - you're just but it's like people will
06:12 - say things like that okay and it's not
06:14 - true if you're fat in your shape that's
06:16 - something you need to work on if you're
06:18 - not financially secure if you're not
06:20 - doing the job you need to be doing or
06:22 - you want to be doing or the things you
06:24 - need to be doing that's something that
06:25 - has to change
06:26 - and you need friends and other people
06:28 - around you kind of calling you out on
06:31 - that regardless you have all these
06:33 - people getting this fake cushion this
06:36 - fake whatever
06:37 - yet you go to all these places it's like
06:40 - hospitals and they interview people who
06:42 - are about to die and they're right down
06:44 - what were the last things on their mind
06:46 - and what's the last thing they're
06:49 - leaving this planet with and you know
06:51 - what's a number one thing people say
06:53 - they say it's regret what kind of regret
06:57 - regret of doing too much or regret of
07:03 - not doing too much and you know what the
07:05 - regret most of the times is its of not
07:08 - doing too much of wishing that they
07:11 - tried to do the things and expand
07:13 - themselves to places where they thought
07:16 - they couldn't and things in then never
07:19 - really took a chance and tried them
07:22 - never gave themselves the confidence
07:24 - believed in something then themselves
07:25 - enough to do those things okay and not
07:29 - taking those chances so it's a morbid
07:32 - topic but I do want you to sometimes
07:35 - think of that because for some of us it
07:38 - can jolt us I know it jolts me and gets
07:41 - me moving but that's that initial spark
07:44 - that initial motivation then later you
07:46 - have to find your why for why you're
07:47 - doing something and that's gonna keep
07:49 - you going it's kind of when you open a
07:51 - door you need that initial energy but to
07:54 - keep the door open you need a doorknob
07:55 - in place so right now maybe you're in a
07:57 - place where you're procrastinating and
07:59 - you're not you're just scurrying along
08:01 - and you're just doing your 9:00 to 5:00
08:03 - and you're just stuck in this in this
08:05 - limbo and you need that initial push so
08:09 - this something that I might say that
08:11 - might be coming off a little harsh but
08:13 - it might be that push that you need then
08:15 - later what you need to do is develop a
08:17 - system for why you're doing this okay
08:19 - maybe you're doing this for your family
08:20 - I know I am doing this and a lot of
08:22 - things for getting my parents or
08:24 - retirement I'm doing this to give my
08:27 - family support because when I got to
08:31 - United States we got in a crazy car
08:33 - accident where everybody in the family
08:35 - came out okay except for my mom she had
08:37 - two disks or two back disks broken and
08:41 - we couldn't afford her surgery so guess
08:46 - what we waited 12 years and in those 12
08:48 - years you know what happened because her
08:50 - back disc was
08:51 - broken she couldn't really move a lot
08:53 - she ended up developing diabetes
08:54 - diabetes she ended up gaining a lot of
08:57 - weight that came with a whole set of
08:59 - another all these other types of
09:01 - problems and seeing that it's kind of
09:04 - broke me as I was growing up because it
09:06 - made me have this really deep feeling of
09:09 - helplessness and I want you guys to
09:13 - understand that it's possible to get out
09:16 - of that okay like for me when I was
09:19 - feeling that deep feeling of
09:20 - helplessness I'm like how could I get
09:21 - out of this what's my why what's my why
09:24 - that could keep me going and doing the
09:26 - things that I'm doing
09:27 - for example staying up till 5:00 a.m.
09:29 - getting two hours of sleep and then just
09:31 - going the next day I'm thinking about
09:33 - those things I don't want that to happen
09:36 - to anybody who's close to me where I
09:38 - literally can't if like if not help them
09:41 - financially something like surgery if we
09:44 - could have gone if we had the money we
09:45 - could have gone this a lot earlier like
09:47 - one night in the hospital was something
09:49 - like thirty thousand dollars and we just
09:51 - couldn't afford it and that really
09:54 - really really really really really blows
09:57 - that just sucks somebody who's so close
10:00 - to you somebody who you love so much and
10:01 - you just watch them agonize over this
10:04 - long course of 12 years so again for me
10:10 - that's what keeps me going that's what
10:12 - keeps me motivated I don't want this to
10:14 - happen to anybody again and that's why
10:15 - I'm like I want to be making a lot of
10:18 - money so I don't have just enough for
10:20 - myself for but for other people around
10:22 - me and maybe that could be your Y or
10:25 - something like this could be your Y as
10:26 - well you know you need that initial push
10:28 - to get going and then you have that Y
10:30 - that's like that door knob that keeps
10:32 - that door open okay that keeps your
10:35 - motivation in place it's the system that
10:37 - keeps you going so kind of think about
10:40 - those things
10:42 - enjoy that and move on from that and
10:47 - understand that when you look at life
10:50 - from that perspective where everything
10:52 - is so macroscopic and that's such a
10:55 - massive scale you'll start to see your
10:57 - little problems as these very little
10:59 - things if you look at this universe and
11:02 - how it's like there's multi
11:04 - universe is going on that little drama
11:06 - that you might have going on with
11:07 - somebody like at work or a family member
11:09 - or a friend that's nothing that doesn't
11:12 - even exist like the universe doesn't
11:13 - care about that so for you if you can
11:16 - start to see all these things at this
11:18 - high of a level you can start ignoring
11:20 - all the little things that are nagging
11:22 - at you and you can start focusing and
11:24 - going to the things that actually really
11:27 - matter all right

Cleaned transcript:

the biggest difference between somebody who is just doing a job and trying to run a company or create our channel like YouTube or whatever you guys know what it is now the biggest difference is your tolerance to ambiguity okay your tolerance to ambiguity and how much can you handle not knowing that's what defines an entrepreneur versus somebody who's just doing a job okay and you can be entrepreneur even doing a job for example if you're a Python developer you can be an entrepreneur and you can be getting different clients and who you're working with you can land jobs not just by sitting and sending resumes maybe you can start networking with people around you there are a lot of ways to be an entrepreneur but again it's a lot about handling that uncertainty and how do you deal with it you have this feeling in your stomach like you're gonna puke not knowing or can you be like this is okay I'm gonna find out what the road is ahead I'm gonna plan something out I'm gonna have a vision and I'm gonna trust my instincts okay so it's a lot of that you know I failed multiple businesses I used to have a channel called chest a steak that has like 150 subs it's dead now go look at it bye I started other things other YouTube videos right remember we would make so many YouTube videos we were trying to do this Hostgator affiliate marketing stuff so many we would literally spend hours upon hours we've spent weeks recording these videos scripting it out trying to make this business how many businesses have we gone through we started Amazon FBA business we started quantum boroughs we started developer products which was about like launching products we reached out to like so many manufacturers in China and built all these relationships only to not lead anywhere and fail but those failures other people see and they go to take a sip of their they go told you so yeah right to take a sip of their little told you soap whereas for us it's a learning experience and kind of battle scars so to speak without those you don't like we won't be here this channel wouldn't be here those references yeah you have to get those references without them you don't really know where you're going and I mean great like they didn't build the platform like chess Tasik and failed but that's the difference between let's say me and somebody else or maybe you know maybe you and somebody else right maybe you both were let's say thirty at some point and then you became thirty one Dave went from being thirty to thirty one without failing and you went from thirty thirty one while failing a few things okay and there's a lot of honor in failure failure is the only way to proceed forward when you go to the gym and if you're picking up five pound dumbbells and curling with them you're never gonna be failing so that's great but are you gonna be making any progress there's gonna be zero progress that you're gonna be making okay so failure is actually your indicator that you're going in the right direction I'm gonna say it again failure is your indicator that you're going in the right direction okay failure is your GPS in life failure and feeder is your GPS in life not Google Maps not ways not Apple Maps not whatever other maps that exist definitely not Apple Maps even though I love Apple they just didn't do a very good job with that freaking app failure and fear is your navigation in life all right as long as you can stand making yourself uncomfortable you're growing when you're very comfortable where you are you are not growing not growing is not wrong but not growing is not making progress if you're okay with that good for you I'm not okay with that my friend is not okay with that my other friend is not okay with that we're okay with going with sleepless nights I bags and all kinds of crazy stuff question is are you if you do want all those results and things that you say you want and the lifestyle that you say you want and the job that you say you want and the impact that you want to make on this world that you say you want why aren't you willing to put in the work that gets you those things do you know it's as easy being exactly where
