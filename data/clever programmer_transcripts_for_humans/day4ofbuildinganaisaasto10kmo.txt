00:02 - month so far we've made $ Z with this
00:04 - app the app that we're building takes
00:06 - YouTube videos and turns them into
00:08 - emails n spoke with an expert yesterday
00:10 - but that expert gave him a pretty
00:12 - complicated solution that involves
00:14 - chunking and Vector databases and I kind
00:16 - of disagree with that approach and I
00:17 - don't think it's going to work so let's
00:19 - call Nas and have a conversation with
00:21 - him about it bro the solution that
00:22 - you're coming up with I just feel like
00:23 - it's Overkill dude chunking and you guys
00:25 - are doing summarizing and like you're
00:26 - going to get back garbage dude bro I
00:28 - feel like you're not me I seriously you
00:31 - don't know what the talking about
00:32 - you think you know AI but you haven't
00:35 - learned we need to with these AI experts
00:37 - let just do this you do your way I do my
00:39 - my way and that's it so I got to work on
00:41 - trying to prove him wrong and started
00:42 - working on a model and Claw 3's Opus
00:45 - model gave me way better results than
00:47 - the GPT garbage that it was spewing so
00:49 - yeah suck it now if you want to be on
00:52 - this journey with us follow for day five
