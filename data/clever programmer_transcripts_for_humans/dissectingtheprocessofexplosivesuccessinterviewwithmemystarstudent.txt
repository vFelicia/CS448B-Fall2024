00:00 - welcome to the happy mindset show
00:02 - episode number 2
00:03 - today's episode is entitled believe in
00:05 - the process and today I have the
00:07 - pleasure of being joined by Cassie from
00:10 - clever programmer I first came across
00:13 - Cassie at the start of this year and
00:15 - what impressed me most about him was his
00:16 - energy and passion for teaching and just
00:19 - for helping other people and as a result
00:21 - that editor decided to sign up as a
00:22 - student with clever programmer and I
00:24 - took the opportunity to get one-to-one
00:27 - mentoring with Cassie so Cassie for
00:29 - anybody who doesn't know who you are yet
00:31 - and what you do could you give us a
00:33 - brief introduction to this yeah for sure
00:35 - so I am I was a college student then I
00:39 - kind of stopped going to college I was
00:42 - because I started clever programmer and
00:44 - clever programmer is all about teaching
00:47 - people how to code and also the soft
00:50 - skills that are around it it's the
00:52 - negotiation skills that you know a lot
00:54 - of the times are not taught even in
00:56 - schools so that's why you have a lot of
00:58 - students who go through colleges come
01:00 - out with a lot of loan $50,000 $100,000
01:04 - worth loans and yet they can't find a
01:06 - job when they come out so clever
01:08 - programmer is about like cutting the fat
01:10 - and teaching you the practical technical
01:12 - skills so you can get started and then
01:15 - get started actually making money with
01:17 - coding and now you know we started last
01:20 - year we had a zero students and I had
01:22 - zero subscribers on my youtube channel
01:24 - and to fast forward one year almost
01:27 - exactly one year actually and we have
01:30 - 50,000 students enrolled in our programs
01:32 - of clever programmer and I we have
01:35 - almost hundred thousand subscribers on
01:37 - YouTube and what started off with just
01:41 - what my initial dream was you know
01:43 - dreams of a young college student turned
01:47 - into like now a company we have about
01:49 - five or six people working and yeah it's
01:53 - been an amazing journey and that's what
01:55 - clever programmer is about you know
01:57 - helping people learn the practical
01:58 - skills so they can get jobs with
02:00 - software development to actually well
02:03 - when I'm hearing you there and how did
02:06 - you start up how did it like how did you
02:07 - get over the procrastination
02:09 - I suppose not believing in yourself at
02:12 - some state I'm presuming you didn't
02:14 - believe in yourself to the extent that
02:15 - you believe in yourself now so how did
02:17 - you get the momentum going from day one
02:18 - how did you why did it look like looking
02:20 - back in it now yeah odd to be honest the
02:24 - number one thing was what I was
02:27 - surrounded by and one of the things that
02:30 - was really important for me to
02:31 - understand was that none of my thoughts
02:33 - are my own and all of our thoughts are
02:36 - actually not our own you know so if
02:38 - you're watching this video you know
02:40 - whatever you're thinking right now you
02:41 - might think it's your own and unique but
02:43 - it's not it's really just affected by
02:45 - whatever you're around so if you're
02:48 - around a lot of people are kind of
02:49 - negative or whatever you're gonna be
02:52 - having those types of thoughts and same
02:53 - way for around positive happy upbeat
02:55 - people you're gonna have those thoughts
02:57 - so for me that was important to realize
03:00 - because I was just in this loop of go to
03:03 - school go to work come back home maybe
03:08 - watch something and then go to sleep and
03:10 - then rinse and repeat and then I started
03:13 - reading books and I realized that
03:15 - everybody who became a millionaire
03:17 - everybody can't became a billionaire
03:18 - everybody who became famous everybody
03:21 - who became a leader a public speaker
03:24 - influenced her greater relationships all
03:27 - of those people had to break out of
03:29 - these norms these normal cycles that
03:33 - everybody you know just finds acceptable
03:36 - and like these are your norms
03:39 - essentially and what I found out was
03:43 - that those were the people I was
03:46 - surrounded by you know everybody who
03:47 - kind of thought in a regular normal way
03:50 - and as long as that happened everything
03:53 - in your life would just be average you
03:56 - know so first I had to make the decision
03:58 - that in certain areas of my life I
04:00 - didn't want to be average anymore that
04:02 - started with you know in business I
04:03 - didn't want to be average in you know
04:05 - starting a YouTube channel I didn't want
04:07 - to be average and then what I started
04:09 - doing was listening to books and
04:14 - changing my habits so those were the key
04:17 - things for me that got me started so you
04:20 - know if I do you want me to expound on
04:22 - that a little bit more yeah
04:23 - a habit in there how'd you start up my
04:25 - experience of habits is that it builds
04:27 - on each other you don't just kind of go
04:28 - straight in trying to fix everything you
04:30 - just get a little habit and it builds
04:32 - momentum so what was your experience
04:33 - with that what habits and changing it
04:36 - around yeah yeah so the main thing that
04:40 - was for me was when I would go to
04:43 - college I had to wake up at a certain
04:46 - time like 7 8 a.m. and get on the train
04:48 - and the first habit that I started with
04:51 - and that was I think the most valuable
04:53 - was that free time I had instead of
04:57 - music I started listening to audible
05:00 - inaudible for those of you who don't
05:01 - know it's like books but audio version
05:03 - cuz it's really hard for me to just sit
05:05 - there and read the book cuz it takes
05:07 - like I'm I feel like I'm not doing
05:09 - anything else but just reading the book
05:11 - whereas when I'm inaudible when I'm
05:14 - driving to when I was driving to the
05:16 - train station I was listening to the
05:18 - book when I was walking to the train
05:21 - before going to college I was listening
05:24 - to my audiobook and then when I was on
05:26 - the train I would be listening to it and
05:29 - when I would get off the train and onto
05:32 - the bus I would still be listening to it
05:33 - so it's a lot of like listening to the
05:37 - book and kind of immersing myself so
05:39 - from the higher picture perspective it
05:42 - was replacing music with audible that
05:46 - was what was amazing and then the second
05:49 - habit that I changed was when I would be
05:51 - eating food instead of watching you know
05:53 - shows like Rick and Morty or Family Guy
05:56 - or house a cars Game of Thrones all I
06:00 - did was that during those 30 minutes
06:02 - that I would be eating I would watch
06:04 - tutorials so that was something that
06:07 - also helped me become the top 1% in the
06:10 - world for chess that was something that
06:11 - helped me become better at Jiu Jitsu
06:13 - like learning to fight that was
06:16 - something I did to become better at
06:17 - coding and essentially I almost felt
06:21 - like I didn't even have to spend any
06:22 - extra time so to speak it was just like
06:24 - these small habits and those were
06:28 - brought the biggest returns
06:31 - yeah very good at like how important is
06:35 - being a generalist like you've mentioned
06:36 - you you're you used to be number one in
06:39 - chess and you're on about jiu-jitsu and
06:40 - you've seen to have a very kind of broad
06:42 - spectrum of interests
06:44 - how important is being a generous to
06:46 - become a really good specialist because
06:47 - for me I see you as a specialist in
06:49 - coding and Python in particular but I
06:52 - also know you know a lot of other
06:53 - languages but Freya for you how
06:55 - important is having a general
06:57 - big-picture view on things to become a
06:59 - really good specialist yeah there was a
07:03 - book I was reading Rich Dad Poor Dad and
07:05 - he in that book his rich dad says being
07:09 - being a specialist is for I don't know I
07:12 - forgot what the term you used but it's
07:14 - supposed to be like condescending or
07:17 - derogatory to the specialist and
07:19 - essentially says that you should be a
07:21 - little bit of a generalist so because
07:24 - it's very important to know the things
07:27 - that you don't know yet because here's
07:30 - the thing like let's say you're being a
07:32 - specialist right you'll only be
07:34 - improving very linearly and
07:36 - incrementally but sometimes when you
07:39 - look at a completely new technique or a
07:42 - new way of thinking or you go in some
07:44 - completely different direction
07:46 - you might explode explosively so you
07:50 - know for example you could be a
07:51 - Instagram specialist but then you start
07:53 - making YouTube videos and you get like
07:55 - millions of viewers on YouTube versus
07:57 - Instagram so you know it's like you get
08:01 - that explosive growth without you kind
08:03 - of even knowing that that was possible
08:05 - so I think that it's important to be a
08:09 - specialist but I don't think that you
08:13 - know well if you can if you go too deep
08:17 - too deep within something it's kind of
08:20 - like the law of diminishing returns so
08:22 - to speak so I think at some point you
08:25 - have to brighten broaden your horizons
08:27 - and check out what other possibilities
08:29 - are out there that you might not have
08:30 - known of and you could really get that
08:32 - explosive growth ooh and do you find
08:36 - like yes sorry yeah yeah like I'm gonna
08:39 - expand on that just a little bit more
08:40 - like for example I would be coding right
08:43 - so let's say something
08:45 - like just programming I'd be sitting
08:46 - there coding all day for 18 hours but
08:48 - then what I started doing was I got into
08:50 - lifting and health and I would spend a
08:53 - lot of time at the gym so I didn't even
08:54 - have to add much time to coat time to
08:56 - code so I went from like coding for
08:59 - let's say 18 or 15 hours a day to like
09:01 - 10 hours or 8 hours but in that 8 to 10
09:05 - hours I was actually more productive and
09:08 - produce better results and learned a lot
09:11 - more because of lifting hmm you know
09:14 - working out so that's kind of like one
09:17 - aspect of broadening your horizons and
09:19 - how they can help you even in the things
09:21 - you're not we're supposed to be
09:22 - specializing in but they kind of help
09:24 - you from the peripheral yeah it gives
09:28 - you a break and it gives you more
09:29 - balance that that's been more yeah it
09:31 - even exactly it even helped me more than
09:33 - just spending more time doing coding
09:35 - problems you know yeah and I would
09:41 - imagine in your line of work you're an
09:43 - entrepreneur you've got a new business
09:44 - how do you deal with the facing the
09:47 - unknown because it's inevitable when
09:48 - you're innovating all the time when
09:49 - you're trying new things how do you deal
09:52 - with that how do you embrace that and
09:53 - accept that yep so the difference
09:57 - between somebody is an entrepreneur and
09:59 - somebody who just follows the normal
10:01 - path you know like elementary school
10:03 - high school college job promotion and
10:07 - then you die somebody who follows that
10:10 - path versus somebody who goes on a
10:13 - completely new path the only difference
10:15 - between the two and somebody who starts
10:19 - a business is that their tolerance to
10:23 - ambiguity that's really what it comes
10:25 - down to how much can you stand the
10:30 - unknown you know because you know it's
10:33 - scary like when I'm spending time making
10:35 - content and it takes me like I spend
10:38 - let's say one hour of just speaking fast
10:40 - you know I'm like I speak fast so in my
10:42 - videos where I'm coding
10:43 - I'm giving so much knowledge and so much
10:46 - value in it make an hour-long video and
10:48 - then as soon as I'm done I'm about to
10:50 - edit it and I find out that I forgot to
10:53 - hit record on my audio you know yeah
10:58 - and and then like I've already come back
11:01 - I just got back from school and work and
11:03 - it was exhausting and then I do this and
11:06 - this is what happens and I got to do it
11:07 - again and I have zero followers at the
11:09 - time is your subscribers like I don't
11:11 - know if it's gonna turn into anything I
11:13 - don't even know if I'm gonna make money
11:15 - off of it and yeah it's super scary so
11:19 - but it's like how much of that can you
11:22 - tolerate and that what will that's what
11:25 - will determine what will make you
11:26 - successful because before our clever
11:28 - programmer got successful and to
11:30 - everybody it looks like oh it's like an
11:31 - overnight success I mean you know maybe
11:34 - but also there were other businesses
11:36 - that have started that failed like one
11:38 - example is chess tastic which was my
11:40 - chess business that started and
11:41 - hopefully if you're watching this I
11:43 - still have the domain name so if you go
11:45 - on chess tastic com spelled see H es s
11:49 - ta stic com
11:51 - my website is still up and I would be
11:55 - literally spending I was 16 at that time
11:58 - 16 or 17 and I was trying to start this
12:00 - company and I would just be calling
12:02 - libraries all day just left and right
12:06 - you know hey hey this is Kazi from chess
12:09 - tastic I would love to start a chess
12:10 - program you know for students from six
12:13 - to ten years old and every phone call
12:16 - was just like sorry no sorry no sorry no
12:20 - and it took hundreds of those calls till
12:22 - one day we landed a program for chessick
12:26 - in a school and since I couldn't just do
12:32 - this alone it was really hard to get the
12:34 - right sources for where to call because
12:36 - a lot of schools also had already had
12:39 - programs there or didn't even have like
12:41 - any extracurricular activities for
12:43 - younger kids I had to actually learn
12:45 - computer programming that's where I
12:47 - started learning computer programming
12:50 - because what I did was programmatically
12:53 - go through a list of schools and get the
12:56 - ones that had extracurricular activities
12:58 - didn't already have a chess program and
13:02 - basically I brought all of those on like
13:06 - a Google spreadsheet with all their
13:08 - phone numbers and then I sorted by
13:11 - distance and how far they were from my
13:13 - house so so that's how you got into
13:16 - programming I didn't actually know that
13:18 - I go to that yeah we came from practical
13:20 - need that you wanted to become more
13:22 - efficient in finding people for exotic
13:24 - exactly yeah and and I remember I went
13:29 - to a computer programmer in those days I
13:31 - hired him because I couldn't program
13:33 - this on my own and I was pushing
13:35 - programming capabilities of Google
13:37 - Spreadsheets because Google spreadsheet
13:38 - you can code in it too but I was pushing
13:41 - those to the max and it couldn't do it
13:43 - anymore so I'm like okay I need to hire
13:44 - a programmer and remind you at this
13:48 - point I hadn't landed any schools yet
13:50 - any work yet so we had made $0 profit
13:53 - from this and I paid that programmer
13:54 - $400 to write a script like this for me
13:57 - and I remember I was working with and I
13:59 - was like holy Sh this is amazing oh my
14:02 - god like I was just getting so excited
14:04 - and he's like what like this is normal
14:06 - like he's just typing it I was like it's
14:08 - not a big deal but for me it was like
14:11 - wow you could do this with code it's
14:15 - like the most intelligent human being on
14:17 - the planet is by your side at all times
14:20 - for free why wouldn't you take advantage
14:24 - of that so when that happened you know
14:28 - you have to understand like the level of
14:30 - tolerance it takes is somebody who's not
14:32 - even making that much money
14:33 - it was young and I'm spending so much
14:35 - time into my chest a stick business
14:37 - making YouTube videos that weren't even
14:39 - getting that many views building a
14:41 - website taking a risk to call so many
14:45 - schools and hire a programmer for $400
14:47 - and then we ended up getting our first
14:49 - client which you know who paid us $1,200
14:53 - and so we made the money back later same
14:56 - thing when I was starting my clever
14:57 - programmer business I didn't have any
15:00 - money and I was taking out loans to
15:02 - freakin get my iMac so I can record
15:04 - video for you guys that make him high
15:05 - quality without even knowing I was gonna
15:07 - get any money on my return I bought
15:09 - lights professional lights my brother
15:11 - his name is will cause cause II he like
15:14 - edits videos for Netflix and stuff and
15:16 - he's really good at what he does so I
15:18 - remember asking him okay what kind of
15:21 - lights should I get
15:22 - equipment should I get and he was
15:24 - telling me that now I was paying buying
15:28 - those like essentially on loans so again
15:31 - more risk and more ambiguity like I
15:34 - don't know
15:36 - and then eventually you know it started
15:40 - picking up at some point like just a sec
15:42 - failed after like a year of hard work
15:44 - working with the team and everything but
15:47 - then for a clever programmer worked out
15:49 - well so how did you deal with just ethic
15:51 - failing did you look at it from a point
15:53 - of view of what did I learn here and
15:54 - move forward or did it actually hurt or
15:56 - was a mixture of gold oh I absolutely
15:58 - loved the whole experience and
16:01 - absolutely loved it I don't even
16:03 - understand when people are like like you
16:06 - know I had other people around me and
16:07 - they'd be like well you know what
16:09 - happened with your last business so why
16:13 - don't you just relax and hang out with
16:15 - us and I was just like what are you
16:17 - kidding me I learned skills that a CEO
16:21 - want or like when they're getting
16:22 - trained training companies have to pay
16:24 - like millions of dollars to train these
16:26 - people to teach them these skills
16:28 - essentially in my mind I was like
16:30 - becoming a millionaire like I put
16:32 - monetary value in my head to everything
16:35 - just to make it tangible so for example
16:40 - you know I'll be hanging out with
16:42 - somebody who had who has a lot of
16:45 - knowledge about things and even I'm
16:46 - hanging out with them and learning from
16:47 - them I'm thinking holy crap somebody
16:49 - like this who's in this position would
16:51 - be charging $500 to $1,000 an hour for
16:55 - this information during let's say a
16:57 - lesson or a meeting and I'm getting to
17:01 - hang out with them and learn all this so
17:02 - why shouldn't I spend more time with
17:04 - them it's essentially by spending five
17:05 - hours with them I've made $5,000 like
17:08 - I'm rich as hell so what like what is
17:12 - your view and money like from what I'm
17:14 - getting from listening to you it seems
17:15 - like you're approaching things from like
17:17 - it's an adventure and you don't seem to
17:18 - have as much fear around money and and
17:20 - paying things and and seeing the value
17:23 - to people and mentors and all this kind
17:25 - of stuff and real life experience so
17:27 - what is your kind of view on money and
17:29 - as well how important are mentors in the
17:32 - process and even paying a mentor to get
17:33 - valuable information
17:34 - how do you approach these things how
17:36 - would you look at it money is for me it
17:40 - was kind of like this play toy and the
17:43 - reason is cuz I never really had a
17:45 - normal job like I never had a
17:48 - nine-to-five ever and I never will and
17:52 - there was a point in my life when I was
17:54 - about 16 or 17 something like that and I
17:59 - was gonna either go to or maybe 15 I
18:02 - can't remember but I was either gonna go
18:05 - the route of you know what my family
18:07 - always started off with which was like
18:08 - getting a security job or getting a
18:12 - chest job but the chest job was more
18:15 - like hourly and like more like
18:16 - freelancing and the pay difference was
18:19 - the chest job paid me $35 an hour
18:22 - whereas the other job paid me like $8 an
18:25 - hour or 825 an hour you know but it was
18:27 - full-time and I remember going the chest
18:32 - job route and even that job was kind of
18:35 - like entrepreneurial like you never know
18:37 - what classes you're gonna get you
18:38 - actually have to work really hard to
18:39 - land other schools for the company so
18:41 - you can actually teach at those schools
18:43 - and even when you're running the class
18:45 - it's like I thought of it like public
18:47 - speaking so I was getting the chance to
18:49 - public speak did you have a public
18:52 - speaking in any stage or is that
18:54 - something to get over was that for
18:55 - something you didn't think of I still
19:00 - have fear of public speaking but I know
19:08 - like got more con when I start speaking
19:11 - I lose the fear I kind of know what
19:14 - makes me lose the fear which is like
19:16 - when I start talking and moving that
19:18 - helps me lose the fear but yeah I had
19:20 - not it's not that bad anymore we'll see
19:23 - when I'm in front of a crowd you know
19:25 - that would be a little bit different
19:26 - yeah but I think I'll be okay
19:29 - but yeah my it's you know it's hard to
19:31 - handle kids who are like 5 to 10 years
19:34 - old they're brutal they won't listen to
19:36 - you like you have to be authoritative
19:37 - and you have to show them that you can
19:39 - and you have to navigate through a lot
19:42 - of weird funky social situations with
19:45 - younger kids some of them just don't
19:48 - list
19:48 - and they don't care they're like human
19:51 - beings but without any politeness or
19:54 - political correctness so it's like
19:56 - you're dealing with either like really
19:58 - amazing or really like evil little human
20:01 - beings who have no fear and so once you
20:04 - get good at dealing with that you get
20:06 - good at dealing with a lot of difficult
20:08 - situations and public speaking
20:10 - situations and you had another question
20:13 - that I wanted to answer the mint or the
20:17 - the mentors yeah how important are they
20:20 - to you and yeah
20:21 - how important are they yeah so mint okay
20:26 - so the money thing that we were talking
20:28 - about earlier you know money was always
20:29 - like this I want to finish that off and
20:32 - then jump off to them onto the mentor
20:35 - question yeah but how I always saw money
20:38 - was this like really dynamic thing and
20:41 - it was basically an exchange of value
20:44 - that was happening so like let's say I
20:46 - was teaching you a lesson you know and
20:48 - I'm charging you fifty hundred dollars
20:50 - an hour or if you figured out a way to
20:52 - hang out with me essentially are making
20:55 - 100 dollars an hour every freaking hour
20:57 - without doing any work
20:59 - so you're becoming really rich but
21:02 - people just think of money in this super
21:04 - static way like you get money and you
21:06 - just collect it and you just save it up
21:08 - save it up and that's the only thing
21:10 - they know is money and how do you bet it
21:12 - you work a nine to five job and you just
21:14 - keep stashing this thing away yeah or
21:17 - you could hang out with really valuable
21:21 - people who could give you lots of
21:23 - freaking amazing valuable things that
21:25 - would cost you tens or twenty thousand
21:27 - dollars to get by yourself like there
21:30 - are people who are cha charge you $5,000
21:33 - or $10,000 for one consultation now
21:36 - imagine you get to hang out with those
21:37 - people you're essentially making five to
21:40 - ten thousand dollars all the time sounds
21:44 - like a creative way to look at money and
21:46 - one thing yeah just one thing don't
21:47 - think you've know when I'm because a few
21:49 - years ago I was kind of thinking how do
21:50 - I find these mentors and then it's gonna
21:51 - be so hard how did you looking back and
21:54 - how did you come across these mentors
21:55 - how does it actually naturally come into
21:57 - your life as you mind moving towards
21:58 - things money I used money I what I did
22:01 - is
22:02 - instead of just stashing money like just
22:04 - big Tower and sitting on it what I did
22:07 - instead was all the money that I got
22:09 - let's say that I got money for four
22:13 - chests people were paying me $50 an hour
22:16 - or $35 an hour to do chess and it's not
22:18 - just for an hour I mean it's mostly 3-4
22:20 - hours because drive time they're coming
22:22 - back but what I did is all the money
22:25 - that I got then let's say I wanted to
22:27 - learn a skill of table tennis or coding
22:30 - I hired mentor for coding and I paid
22:33 - them 35 or 50 dollars an hour you know
22:38 - system therapy up so uh yeah I was like
22:40 - one hour of my chess skill got me one
22:43 - hour of coding skill yeah and then what
22:45 - I wanted to do was get clients where I
22:48 - was charging more money so then if I
22:50 - just got to charge hundred dollars an
22:52 - hour to a client essentially I was
22:53 - getting two hours of a good programmers
22:56 - time yeah
22:58 - for one hour of my time and also if I
23:03 - got a good programmer at a cheaper price
23:04 - like let's say $30 $40 an hour
23:08 - essentially for you know one hour of my
23:11 - time I was getting two to three hours of
23:12 - somebody else's time now and I you know
23:15 - so people a lot of that times they'll be
23:18 - like oh why should I pay a lot of money
23:21 - let me just try to find the cheapest
23:23 - person possible but they forget that
23:26 - it's okay it's actually less valuable to
23:31 - you because if you get somebody for
23:33 - eight to ten dollars like they're not
23:35 - gonna be that great at their skill and
23:38 - you're losing like two to three hours of
23:41 - your time learning something that would
23:43 - have taken 15 minutes from somebody
23:45 - who's really good it's your time over
23:48 - money pretty much exactly yeah so
23:53 - instead of asking how could I hire
23:55 - somebody for really cheap think to
23:57 - yourself how can I make more money so I
23:59 - can hire more valuable person like
24:01 - that's really what it is and then you
24:03 - get your skills a lot faster in a
24:05 - shorter period of time
24:07 - exactly money the last thing I want to
24:11 - say end it off that that one with his
24:13 - money is just one way to hire a mentor
24:15 - that's what I was doing earlier now I'm
24:18 - becoming much better with just social
24:21 - skills and I'm trying to put myself in
24:23 - situations where I'm always either
24:25 - uncomfortable or challenged or feel
24:28 - intimidated and that's how I'm now
24:30 - connecting with really valuable people
24:32 - like you know even in LA that's what I'm
24:34 - trying to do so I'm connecting with
24:36 - people where they're making a lot of
24:37 - money or we're really successful and
24:40 - famous and now I'm learning those skills
24:42 - like that that's how I'm acquiring
24:44 - mentors now so either use money or use
24:47 - social skills perfect so let's get over
24:51 - to the technical skills no so if I want
24:52 - to learn a new skill one thing I've seen
24:55 - you do is talk about reverse engineering
24:56 - it so you look at the angle and you walk
24:58 - backwards could you explain that in the
25:00 - context of learning a coding programming
25:03 - language like Python for example just
25:05 - for the listeners what do you mean by
25:07 - reverse engineering so say for example
25:09 - what I did when I was working with you
25:10 - is that I wanted to learn Python we had
25:14 - a project we picked flasks and and I
25:15 - look at flasks and they broke it down
25:16 - into well you got the front end in the
25:19 - backend for the front-end of bootstrap
25:21 - okay when I went forward to go I know
25:24 - what you make you know I know what you
25:26 - mean okay so here's how I think of
25:29 - learning and I think the academic system
25:31 - has it completely dumb an unnatural way
25:34 - which I disagree with which is okay you
25:39 - want to learn soccer for your first time
25:41 - okay let's do this come to my class and
25:44 - then I'm gonna have go on my white chalk
25:47 - board and then I'm gonna write down
25:48 - notes and Syrian history about soccer
25:51 - for like the first few weeks and then
25:53 - the next week we go to kick the soccer
25:56 - ball and actually play with it what why
26:01 - no it's not gonna make any sense to you
26:03 - if you try to theoretically learn how to
26:07 - play soccer they're not gonna improve
26:08 - you have to play what soccer ball first
26:11 - then if you learn about it it's very
26:13 - relevant and everything makes sense so I
26:16 - think with learning what I try to do
26:20 - with coding when I'm teaching somebody
26:22 - coding I don't want to just start you
26:25 - off with bitwise operators and like
26:27 - weird esoteric knowledge
26:29 - that is only helpful for itself I want
26:32 - to start you off with let's see
26:33 - something complicated like a full
26:34 - website we make the entire website now
26:37 - you know holy crap like you can make a
26:39 - website with coding and oh my god this
26:41 - is real this is tangible you're excited
26:43 - and you've gone to play with it so
26:45 - everything makes sense in context now
26:48 - now what I do is now I take you and
26:50 - teach you bitwise operators and they're
26:52 - really boring stuff and guess what the
26:53 - boring stuff is not boring anymore
26:55 - because everything you're learning now
26:57 - you're like oh and I could use this to
26:59 - add this to my website or I could use
27:01 - this to add to this part of the code and
27:03 - it'll work so everything is in context
27:05 - not boring and it's relevant and you
27:09 - learn a lot faster like this so that's
27:11 - yeah so reverse engineer the way that
27:13 - you learn play bill learn I call it my
27:16 - eighty fifteen five instead of eighty
27:18 - twenty eighty percent of the time should
27:20 - be spent playing with something if you
27:21 - want to learn it like just naturally
27:23 - think about how animals learn to run to
27:26 - walk to hunt fifteen percent of the time
27:29 - should be spent actually trying to build
27:30 - something meaningful with it and five
27:32 - percent of the time should be spend just
27:34 - boring dry learning through a textbook
27:36 - or just watching a video passively
27:39 - perfect it actually now when you're
27:41 - talking about it the first thing I can
27:43 - remember when I did your beginners
27:44 - course in Python was the turtle module
27:46 - like remember kind of when I saw it like
27:48 - this is incredibly it was after a few
27:49 - days and that's where I really went like
27:50 - I can do this now so there's a huge
27:53 - thing for me I mean it's you getting
27:55 - immediate feedback too with the turtle
27:57 - because visually things are happening
27:59 - whereas most courses will have things
28:01 - we're just like some quantitative you
28:03 - have to get this math formula right and
28:05 - half the time you don't even know what
28:06 - you get the right result or the wrong
28:07 - result a visual that you can see what's
28:10 - happening and so it leads you in the
28:11 - right direction
28:12 - the other thing actually I do like about
28:13 - you too is that you recommend other
28:15 - courses and that actually supplement the
28:17 - knowledge that you recommend it courses
28:18 - in Udacity and Coursera and our other
28:21 - platforms which kind of supplement as I
28:23 - move along so it's not just all all
28:25 - action and stuff if there is some theory
28:27 - that's supplementing when I can
28:29 - understand it from the context that's
28:32 - right I know what I like and yes thing
28:34 - is I suppose how important it like from
28:36 - clever programming there's a community
28:37 - there the students there how important
28:39 - are other student
28:40 - than being in an environment where
28:41 - everybody's facing in the same direction
28:42 - everybody wants to learn a new skill oh
28:45 - and how do I find that if I feel like
28:47 - I'm in an area where nobody else is
28:49 - interested in programming how do I get
28:51 - over that and how do I find these people
28:54 - yeah oh my god it's so helpful like if
28:58 - you learned something by yourself
29:00 - something that would take you 15 days to
29:02 - learn let's say or 12 this learn by
29:04 - yourself if you're around people you'll
29:06 - learn that same thing in like two days
29:08 - maybe faster because oh so how you can
29:14 - actually get that where you can have
29:16 - those people around you is like I was at
29:18 - home and I would be learning this and I
29:22 - realized that it's gonna be really slow
29:24 - if I just learned this by myself so I'm
29:25 - gonna learn this with people and what I
29:27 - did is I got access to a co-working
29:29 - space I'm not sure if you know people
29:32 - who are watching this know what it is
29:33 - and if you don't know what it is
29:35 - co-working spaces are just like these
29:37 - places where you can pay hundred 200
29:39 - ollars a month and essentially everybody
29:43 - just goes to work there so some of these
29:45 - people are like professionals that like
29:46 - you know maybe they're professional
29:48 - coders maybe they're professional video
29:49 - editors whatever they all go to this one
29:52 - space to work and you can just go there
29:55 - and work and so you'll find a lot of
29:57 - people who do coding there and you can
30:00 - learn from them and some of these are
30:01 - gonna mentor you that's how I found my
30:03 - first true mentor his name is Nick and
30:06 - I'm not so much in touch with him now
30:08 - I'm probably gonna call him soon after
30:11 - this maybe now that I remember but he
30:14 - was the reason I was able to learn
30:15 - programming so fast because he saw me
30:17 - and he took me under his wing and I met
30:20 - him at a place called ps1 in Chicago and
30:22 - it's a co-working space you can find
30:24 - spaces for even cheaper than hundred
30:26 - dollars a month but yeah co-working
30:28 - spaces are great and if you don't have
30:30 - the money for that meetup.com sorry man
30:32 - it's free it's like use it use those
30:36 - things go to those events they put
30:38 - events there you can go for free and
30:40 - also you can host your own meetup I have
30:43 - my own made up for clever programmer and
30:45 - I was getting people to my personal
30:47 - meetup and I got some clients that way
30:49 - as well
30:51 - hmm yeah I know I used me to quite a bit
30:52 - to add is a good recommendation now that
30:54 - you say that there's a co-working space
30:56 - that just open up and wrap mine is there
30:57 - recently that I saw and I didn't know
31:00 - that the term it was co-working spaces
31:02 - yeah I suppose the other thing is that I
31:06 - hear you talk about systems a lot and
31:08 - could you explain like how do i how
31:09 - would I develop a learning system is
31:11 - there something I can create straight
31:12 - away or is there something that develops
31:13 - over time okay so can you you want to be
31:18 - a little bit more specific than what
31:19 - you're asking I want to make sure that I
31:20 - answer specifically yeah like I suppose
31:23 - I want to learn I want to learn Python
31:26 - programming I'm starting off beginner
31:28 - level I've done the beginners course I
31:29 - want to take it further but I also wants
31:31 - to start developing a system so it makes
31:33 - it easier for me to keep doing it
31:35 - consistently every day and like half of
31:37 - this Pat carrot of carob doubt but I
31:40 - don't really know how to set up a system
31:42 - or I don't really even know what that
31:43 - means properly it yeah I guess I see
31:46 - what you're saying
31:47 - odd so I'm gonna give you a more general
31:49 - rule for this that's what I think you
31:51 - know um your viewers will also find very
31:53 - valuable it's the same thing with that
31:56 - you have with willpower and motivation
31:58 - and here's one example
32:01 - so willpower it's really hard to get
32:05 - that all the time and if you have your
32:07 - brain making decisions all the time
32:09 - you're gonna get exhausted and you're
32:11 - gonna make the easier decision okay
32:13 - let's say you're trying to diet and you
32:15 - keep having to make the decision to not
32:16 - eat cake you're gonna get exhausted
32:19 - you're gonna eat that damn cake now on
32:21 - the other hand let's say there's no cake
32:23 - at home at the house so you don't even
32:26 - have to make the decision yes or no
32:27 - that's better that's a system for
32:30 - getting healthier just don't have that
32:32 - food in your house don't let yourself
32:34 - you don't even give yourself that option
32:36 - same thing with willpower and motivation
32:39 - you know willpower is kind of like the
32:41 - energy you need to get the door moving
32:45 - and opening and a system or a system is
32:49 - like putting a doorknob once that door
32:51 - is open and now that door just stays
32:53 - opened okay so so let's say in the start
32:57 - you had to use willpower and a lot of
32:59 - energy to get you know start coding okay
33:04 - you have to learn a lot
33:05 - to make sure that it was the right thing
33:07 - for you you have to make sure that you
33:08 - weren't too dumb to learn it and once
33:12 - you start making progress in it that one
33:14 - day you decide to actually commit now
33:16 - that's you pushing and opening the door
33:18 - right the door is opening now what you
33:20 - have to do is put a doorknob in there
33:22 - because if you just keep holding it
33:24 - you're gonna get tired and the doors
33:25 - gonna close at some point so now
33:28 - doorknob is building a system in place
33:31 - that system for you could be scheduling
33:34 - it you know where you have it in your
33:37 - calendar that you're gonna be coding
33:40 - this time block so it's not even a
33:42 - choice like you just have to be doing it
33:44 - but let's say you don't have that
33:45 - discipline yet you need accountability
33:47 - so the other system you could put in
33:49 - place is go to meetup.com and for the
33:52 - next few weeks just booked out the damn
33:54 - events in advance so they're already in
33:57 - your calendar they're already booked out
33:58 - and you know you're gonna be going there
34:00 - and coding with them they have coding
34:02 - hours and they just have free working
34:04 - hours and you can go there just code
34:05 - during that time or book out a you know
34:09 - hire once a week you can do hourly
34:12 - session with a mentor online and even
34:15 - good mentor will cost you something like
34:16 - $50 an hour and you could do one session
34:19 - a week that's $200 a month it's not that
34:22 - much just freaking sell one thing on
34:24 - ebay every month extra and you get that
34:26 - $200 or put in a few extra hours at work
34:30 - and now you have one hour of mentoring
34:34 - every day already in your schedule you
34:36 - know you have to show up for it because
34:38 - you've paid for it and that's another
34:40 - trick to hold yourself accountable by
34:42 - paying for something so yeah those are
34:44 - the tools you can use and the systems
34:47 - you can build to make sure that that
34:49 - door is open and that doorknob is always
34:51 - there perfect for another thing that I
34:56 - think that you would have experienced
34:57 - would be compound compound learning and
35:00 - a lot of people we know about
35:01 - compounding in finance but I've also
35:03 - realized this compounding is applicable
35:04 - to learning and still starts building on
35:06 - top of each other and you've got points
35:08 - of references that you learned in other
35:09 - fields could you just speak a little bit
35:11 - about that kind of what's been your
35:12 - experience in the acceleration curve for
35:14 - learning new things because you've
35:16 - already learned
35:16 - things that are similar and you got
35:19 - strong reference points to learn a new
35:20 - thing from oh this is what I feel like
35:25 - the reason why for me it's better to
35:27 - code a lot at one point right like spend
35:31 - a lot of time doing that one thing
35:32 - rather than a little bit of time every
35:34 - day because um what happens with
35:38 - learning is that once it starts to click
35:40 - you start learning super fast like let's
35:42 - say that you just started off in chess
35:45 - and you have no idea how anything moves
35:47 - you have no idea how the rules work
35:49 - learning is very tough nothing makes
35:52 - sense if you even watch other people
35:54 - playing you're not gonna be learning it
35:56 - just hurts your head um but once let's
35:58 - see you get to a certain point where you
36:00 - go to your first tournament or maybe you
36:02 - just learned how to play how the pieces
36:03 - move in everything now you know other
36:06 - people other people are doing things
36:08 - you're a being you're like oh that's
36:10 - that trick they're using oh now I get
36:12 - what's happening so it's essentially
36:15 - like once you have that initial
36:17 - framework you start learning really fast
36:20 - and the better you are in something the
36:22 - faster you learn it and improve more so
36:27 - you know when you're trying to pick up a
36:29 - skill you want to get to that level
36:31 - where it's deep then when you're sort
36:33 - learning fast don't get frustrated in
36:35 - the start when you can't learn expect to
36:36 - not be able to learn in the start you
36:38 - know a lot of people will start picking
36:40 - up a skill like playing pool and right
36:42 - in there for a first game when they lose
36:43 - you know I'm talking about pool like
36:45 - snooker and when they lose they'll get
36:47 - really frustrated they're like oh I suck
36:49 - but once you lose like 50 games or 2030
36:53 - games that's when you'll hit a point
36:54 - where you'll start learning fast and
36:56 - that's when you actually start improving
36:58 - super fast you just have to have that
37:00 - patience and go through that failure and
37:02 - the start and then you hit that sweet
37:04 - spot you go oh perfect so your view of
37:08 - the other is quite quite a bit different
37:10 - to the conventional senses it's oh dude
37:13 - I love failure I absolutely love failure
37:15 - if you don't fit like let's say you go
37:17 - to the gym and you're lifting like five
37:19 - pound dumbbells of course you're never
37:21 - failing but you're never improving
37:23 - you'll go home looking the same every
37:24 - time
37:25 - so if you can if you're failing you know
37:30 - when you're
37:30 - Jim for example if you're failing that's
37:32 - how you know that that's a weight you
37:34 - have to go to you know you have to work
37:36 - your way to I don't know why people see
37:39 - failure is so bad honestly if I don't
37:40 - fail at something I don't even like I
37:43 - don't even want to do it cuz I'm like
37:45 - that's all there is to it there's no
37:47 - depth to this thing so yeah enjoy
37:50 - failure use failure as your beacon to
37:53 - where you need to go it's like your GPS
37:55 - failure and fear is your GPS to life as
37:59 - well as the path to growth to its growth
38:01 - its growth is that my opinion a growth
38:03 - is what we're searching for and failure
38:05 - is a part of growth yes yes pretty much
38:08 - it yeah so where you are now what's the
38:10 - what's the current vision of recovery
38:12 - program are moving forward and what's
38:13 - the next thing that's coming up and both
38:15 - and some of the new things I want to do
38:19 - now is like run do public speaking
38:21 - events for a clever programmer where I'm
38:24 - meeting people in real life in different
38:26 - countries in different cities I don't
38:28 - even care if I get two people to show up
38:29 - at a certain spot like I want to go out
38:33 - there and like physically meet clever
38:35 - program or fans or just new people who
38:37 - are trying to learn because the
38:39 - difference that it makes being live is
38:41 - so much more than just even seeing video
38:44 - um and I want to try to do that and and
38:49 - help as many people as I can help myself
38:51 - in the process to like I'm learning more
38:54 - than even you guys you know in my videos
38:56 - when I'm speaking him that's why I like
38:57 - teaching because you learn so much and
39:00 - to be honest like I'm focusing less on
39:02 - actually the technical programming side
39:04 - because there's so much there's so many
39:08 - learning opportunities because what I'm
39:10 - realizing more and more is that it's not
39:12 - the technical things that are stopping
39:13 - people it's that behavior change to
39:15 - start learning coding programming to
39:18 - make a decision to do something to take
39:20 - action like those are the things that
39:22 - are stopping people I want to be
39:24 - specific more to the realm of computer
39:26 - programming so no not just general
39:28 - motivation like I want to motivate you
39:30 - guys to do coding you know become
39:32 - software developers but like I want to
39:34 - help people
39:34 - aim higher than just a job you know like
39:38 - I met this one friend who's making
39:41 - almost quarter-million dollars and he's
39:43 - about to work at snapchat now
39:44 - who's worked at Google and he's a
39:45 - software developer so I want to help
39:47 - people and tell them that they're it's
39:49 - not just six-figure is not your barrier
39:51 - a software developer you can even make
39:52 - more money and then also that you can
39:55 - start your own company as a software
39:56 - developer you know so I want to teach
39:59 - people programming then later I'm gonna
40:02 - teach you how to maybe scale a
40:03 - freelancing agency that's one of the
40:05 - things I did in college I got so many
40:08 - clients for software development that I
40:09 - hired people who were high quality
40:11 - people and I basically was a middleman
40:14 - and just managed them and they did some
40:16 - of the software development and I was
40:17 - making money essentially just being a
40:20 - college so there are you know first you
40:24 - start off as a software developer then
40:26 - you can have your own freelancing agency
40:28 - if you want or run your own business and
40:32 - that's kind of the things that I want to
40:34 - teach people where I see the future of
40:36 - clever programmer going and I'm honestly
40:39 - really excited for it I even want to do
40:41 - boot camps with students where you know
40:43 - they fly out and we do like a boot camp
40:45 - with a group of students live you know
40:47 - just immersive like two to three days
40:50 - ten hours a day you know the whole life
40:53 - is about coding for those two or three
40:54 - days so yeah there are a lot of big
40:56 - things that I want to do moving forward
40:59 - yeah sounds great and what came up there
41:02 - now is what's your opinion on boot camps
41:05 - and the conventional computer science
41:06 - degree well what were you but where do
41:09 - you see it see things now do we need to
41:10 - glue them or I would say boot camps are
41:14 - better than I mean it's always tough but
41:18 - boot camps I prefer more than a college
41:22 - degree now I know there will be somebody
41:24 - will be like but college degrees for
41:26 - years long at boot camp is three months
41:28 - long well take the boot camp and then
41:30 - still keep learning don't stop learning
41:31 - you know just because a school system or
41:34 - a teacher is not teaching you it doesn't
41:35 - mean you stop learning also another
41:38 - important point I want to make it's
41:39 - college or both coding boot camp it's
41:41 - just one source of learning so always
41:44 - have multiple sources of learning like
41:46 - be learning by watching videos be
41:47 - learning by reading books be learning by
41:49 - building projects and then will be
41:51 - learning from a coding boot camp and be
41:53 - learning from a college so between
41:55 - college and coding boot camp
41:57 - prefer bootcamp because it's so
41:59 - immersive but just remember that after
42:02 - those three months still keep learning
42:04 - moving forward and bootcamp teaches you
42:07 - relevant skills it's always like
42:09 - up-to-date most of the times and they
42:12 - teach you how to get a job right away
42:14 - whereas college focus is very little on
42:17 - the aspect of getting a job which is
42:19 - super weird because the only reason
42:21 - people graduate yes is to become
42:23 - knowledgeable but ultimately to get work
42:25 - and started getting paid for the things
42:27 - that they're doing you know yeah um yeah
42:30 - so my final question is what's your
42:33 - favorite book and and why because I
42:36 - happy I won is it that we were big on
42:37 - books and we love books and reading so I
42:39 - have so many favorite books can I
42:41 - mention multiple yep go freak
42:43 - go for it okay
42:47 - so depends where you are in life that's
42:49 - the important thing about books and what
42:52 - you need at that time so sometimes it's
42:54 - motivation you need and you'll recognize
42:56 - that when you're feeling low when you
42:58 - can't drag yourself out of bed when you
43:00 - can't produce content and you need that
43:02 - willpower and you can't say no to your
43:04 - friend who wants to hang out because you
43:07 - know you should be making the content or
43:09 - you should be writing a blog or you
43:11 - should be working on something but
43:12 - you're just like yeah okay fine let's go
43:14 - out let's do let's hang out for
43:16 - motivation and getting [ __ ] done read
43:19 - 10x by Grant Cardone amazing book one of
43:23 - the books that really changed my life
43:25 - for software developments just soft
43:28 - skills of software development and being
43:32 - more well-rounded getting the kick in
43:34 - the ass and then also kind of starting
43:36 - your own thing like YouTube channels and
43:38 - things like that
43:38 - Reid so software developers manual life
43:44 - manual by Johnson m'as okay I'm actually
43:47 - reading out of his books at the moment -
43:48 - the complete software developers go
43:50 - ahead and I really find this stuff
43:51 - insightful it's not just coding it's
43:53 - also just your way of looking at things
43:55 - in Southfield and everything it's kind
43:56 - of combined into one hell yeah that was
43:59 - a reason my channel started by the way
44:00 - he's my he was my hero that's why my
44:04 - channel is called clever programmer
44:06 - sounds awfully similar to simple
44:08 - programmer
44:09 - and yeah now I'm gonna have more subs on
44:12 - him soon which is amazing because when I
44:14 - started I was I had zero and he was that
44:17 - like whatever subs um and hopefully I'll
44:19 - get to meet him one day and I'll I still
44:21 - see him as my mentor and I still respect
44:23 - him a lot so that's the second book I
44:25 - recommend if you want to become you know
44:27 - financially more financially independent
44:33 - and have better ways of thinking about
44:35 - money and life lessons I read Rich Dad
44:37 - Poor Dad
44:39 - unbelievable book completely will change
44:41 - your mind and how you think of money
44:44 - Rich Dad Poor Dad amazing book mmm
44:49 - 21 sleeping strategies I think it's
44:53 - called and that's a book that was
44:54 - another one that helped change my life
44:56 - because I started sleeping at 10 p.m.
44:57 - and I started waking up at 5:30 a.m. and
45:00 - the stuff that I got done by 10 or 11
45:03 - a.m. I was already ahead of like 90% of
45:05 - the people in the world and then I had
45:09 - the rest of the day to conquer
45:10 - everything you know I'm 23 years old and
45:13 - from the last few years I've been
45:16 - hitting six figures doing software
45:17 - development now my business is hitting
45:19 - six figures and hopefully next year
45:21 - we'll be hitting seven figures so
45:23 - there's a sign that you know some of it
45:25 - is successful and has been giving me
45:27 - good results so that book is really good
45:29 - and then a few other books that aren't
45:32 - coming in my head right now but does
45:35 - that kind of answer the question well
45:37 - that's pretty well relman trees a good
45:38 - number to and I'll put the links to
45:40 - everything in the end in the notes in
45:43 - the video too even to your camera
45:44 - programmer calm is the site and if you
45:47 - want to go there and check out what
45:48 - Cassie is doing yeah I think that's a
45:52 - lot of information for one day it's
45:53 - really insightful stuff for for my
45:55 - Lister's in my audience and yeah just
45:57 - like thank our - thank you again for
45:59 - taking the time to talk to us today and
46:01 - to give us your insights into how you've
46:03 - come about creating such a great a great
46:05 - thing in the world because people are
46:07 - actually doing more what you want to do
46:08 - that's what I've seen
46:09 - clever program where people are coming
46:11 - there they're also getting social skills
46:13 - is not just technical skills they're
46:15 - getting both they're getting a good
46:16 - balance so yeah thanks again for
46:19 - talking to us today no thanks so much
46:22 - this was unbelievable this brings so
46:24 - much value I want to be doing this
46:27 - actually more often honestly like this
46:29 - was freaking awesome
46:30 - yeah it's gonna bring so much value to
46:32 - your viewers like this was so good I'm
46:35 - gonna be watching this and getting value
46:36 - out of this yeah this is great and I
46:40 - want to use this for clever programmer
46:41 - as well as that cool yeah it's good with
46:43 - me
46:43 - perfect so until the next time and the
46:46 - next episode have fun and enjoy the
46:48 - process

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to the happy mindset show episode number 2 today's episode is entitled believe in the process and today I have the pleasure of being joined by Cassie from clever programmer I first came across Cassie at the start of this year and what impressed me most about him was his energy and passion for teaching and just for helping other people and as a result that editor decided to sign up as a student with clever programmer and I took the opportunity to get onetoone mentoring with Cassie so Cassie for anybody who doesn't know who you are yet and what you do could you give us a brief introduction to this yeah for sure so I am I was a college student then I kind of stopped going to college I was because I started clever programmer and clever programmer is all about teaching people how to code and also the soft skills that are around it it's the negotiation skills that you know a lot of the times are not taught even in schools so that's why you have a lot of students who go through colleges come out with a lot of loan $50,000 $100,000 worth loans and yet they can't find a job when they come out so clever programmer is about like cutting the fat and teaching you the practical technical skills so you can get started and then get started actually making money with coding and now you know we started last year we had a zero students and I had zero subscribers on my youtube channel and to fast forward one year almost exactly one year actually and we have 50,000 students enrolled in our programs of clever programmer and I we have almost hundred thousand subscribers on YouTube and what started off with just what my initial dream was you know dreams of a young college student turned into like now a company we have about five or six people working and yeah it's been an amazing journey and that's what clever programmer is about you know helping people learn the practical skills so they can get jobs with software development to actually well when I'm hearing you there and how did you start up how did it like how did you get over the procrastination I suppose not believing in yourself at some state I'm presuming you didn't believe in yourself to the extent that you believe in yourself now so how did you get the momentum going from day one how did you why did it look like looking back in it now yeah odd to be honest the number one thing was what I was surrounded by and one of the things that was really important for me to understand was that none of my thoughts are my own and all of our thoughts are actually not our own you know so if you're watching this video you know whatever you're thinking right now you might think it's your own and unique but it's not it's really just affected by whatever you're around so if you're around a lot of people are kind of negative or whatever you're gonna be having those types of thoughts and same way for around positive happy upbeat people you're gonna have those thoughts so for me that was important to realize because I was just in this loop of go to school go to work come back home maybe watch something and then go to sleep and then rinse and repeat and then I started reading books and I realized that everybody who became a millionaire everybody can't became a billionaire everybody who became famous everybody who became a leader a public speaker influenced her greater relationships all of those people had to break out of these norms these normal cycles that everybody you know just finds acceptable and like these are your norms essentially and what I found out was that those were the people I was surrounded by you know everybody who kind of thought in a regular normal way and as long as that happened everything in your life would just be average you know so first I had to make the decision that in certain areas of my life I didn't want to be average anymore that started with you know in business I didn't want to be average in you know starting a YouTube channel I didn't want to be average and then what I started doing was listening to books and changing my habits so those were the key things for me that got me started so you know if I do you want me to expound on that a little bit more yeah a habit in there how'd you start up my experience of habits is that it builds on each other you don't just kind of go straight in trying to fix everything you just get a little habit and it builds momentum so what was your experience with that what habits and changing it around yeah yeah so the main thing that was for me was when I would go to college I had to wake up at a certain time like 7 8 a.m. and get on the train and the first habit that I started with and that was I think the most valuable was that free time I had instead of music I started listening to audible inaudible for those of you who don't know it's like books but audio version cuz it's really hard for me to just sit there and read the book cuz it takes like I'm I feel like I'm not doing anything else but just reading the book whereas when I'm inaudible when I'm driving to when I was driving to the train station I was listening to the book when I was walking to the train before going to college I was listening to my audiobook and then when I was on the train I would be listening to it and when I would get off the train and onto the bus I would still be listening to it so it's a lot of like listening to the book and kind of immersing myself so from the higher picture perspective it was replacing music with audible that was what was amazing and then the second habit that I changed was when I would be eating food instead of watching you know shows like Rick and Morty or Family Guy or house a cars Game of Thrones all I did was that during those 30 minutes that I would be eating I would watch tutorials so that was something that also helped me become the top 1% in the world for chess that was something that helped me become better at Jiu Jitsu like learning to fight that was something I did to become better at coding and essentially I almost felt like I didn't even have to spend any extra time so to speak it was just like these small habits and those were brought the biggest returns yeah very good at like how important is being a generalist like you've mentioned you you're you used to be number one in chess and you're on about jiujitsu and you've seen to have a very kind of broad spectrum of interests how important is being a generous to become a really good specialist because for me I see you as a specialist in coding and Python in particular but I also know you know a lot of other languages but Freya for you how important is having a general bigpicture view on things to become a really good specialist yeah there was a book I was reading Rich Dad Poor Dad and he in that book his rich dad says being being a specialist is for I don't know I forgot what the term you used but it's supposed to be like condescending or derogatory to the specialist and essentially says that you should be a little bit of a generalist so because it's very important to know the things that you don't know yet because here's the thing like let's say you're being a specialist right you'll only be improving very linearly and incrementally but sometimes when you look at a completely new technique or a new way of thinking or you go in some completely different direction you might explode explosively so you know for example you could be a Instagram specialist but then you start making YouTube videos and you get like millions of viewers on YouTube versus Instagram so you know it's like you get that explosive growth without you kind of even knowing that that was possible so I think that it's important to be a specialist but I don't think that you know well if you can if you go too deep too deep within something it's kind of like the law of diminishing returns so to speak so I think at some point you have to brighten broaden your horizons and check out what other possibilities are out there that you might not have known of and you could really get that explosive growth ooh and do you find like yes sorry yeah yeah like I'm gonna expand on that just a little bit more like for example I would be coding right so let's say something like just programming I'd be sitting there coding all day for 18 hours but then what I started doing was I got into lifting and health and I would spend a lot of time at the gym so I didn't even have to add much time to coat time to code so I went from like coding for let's say 18 or 15 hours a day to like 10 hours or 8 hours but in that 8 to 10 hours I was actually more productive and produce better results and learned a lot more because of lifting hmm you know working out so that's kind of like one aspect of broadening your horizons and how they can help you even in the things you're not we're supposed to be specializing in but they kind of help you from the peripheral yeah it gives you a break and it gives you more balance that that's been more yeah it even exactly it even helped me more than just spending more time doing coding problems you know yeah and I would imagine in your line of work you're an entrepreneur you've got a new business how do you deal with the facing the unknown because it's inevitable when you're innovating all the time when you're trying new things how do you deal with that how do you embrace that and accept that yep so the difference between somebody is an entrepreneur and somebody who just follows the normal path you know like elementary school high school college job promotion and then you die somebody who follows that path versus somebody who goes on a completely new path the only difference between the two and somebody who starts a business is that their tolerance to ambiguity that's really what it comes down to how much can you stand the unknown you know because you know it's scary like when I'm spending time making content and it takes me like I spend let's say one hour of just speaking fast you know I'm like I speak fast so in my videos where I'm coding I'm giving so much knowledge and so much value in it make an hourlong video and then as soon as I'm done I'm about to edit it and I find out that I forgot to hit record on my audio you know yeah and and then like I've already come back I just got back from school and work and it was exhausting and then I do this and this is what happens and I got to do it again and I have zero followers at the time is your subscribers like I don't know if it's gonna turn into anything I don't even know if I'm gonna make money off of it and yeah it's super scary so but it's like how much of that can you tolerate and that what will that's what will determine what will make you successful because before our clever programmer got successful and to everybody it looks like oh it's like an overnight success I mean you know maybe but also there were other businesses that have started that failed like one example is chess tastic which was my chess business that started and hopefully if you're watching this I still have the domain name so if you go on chess tastic com spelled see H es s ta stic com my website is still up and I would be literally spending I was 16 at that time 16 or 17 and I was trying to start this company and I would just be calling libraries all day just left and right you know hey hey this is Kazi from chess tastic I would love to start a chess program you know for students from six to ten years old and every phone call was just like sorry no sorry no sorry no and it took hundreds of those calls till one day we landed a program for chessick in a school and since I couldn't just do this alone it was really hard to get the right sources for where to call because a lot of schools also had already had programs there or didn't even have like any extracurricular activities for younger kids I had to actually learn computer programming that's where I started learning computer programming because what I did was programmatically go through a list of schools and get the ones that had extracurricular activities didn't already have a chess program and basically I brought all of those on like a Google spreadsheet with all their phone numbers and then I sorted by distance and how far they were from my house so so that's how you got into programming I didn't actually know that I go to that yeah we came from practical need that you wanted to become more efficient in finding people for exotic exactly yeah and and I remember I went to a computer programmer in those days I hired him because I couldn't program this on my own and I was pushing programming capabilities of Google Spreadsheets because Google spreadsheet you can code in it too but I was pushing those to the max and it couldn't do it anymore so I'm like okay I need to hire a programmer and remind you at this point I hadn't landed any schools yet any work yet so we had made $0 profit from this and I paid that programmer $400 to write a script like this for me and I remember I was working with and I was like holy Sh this is amazing oh my god like I was just getting so excited and he's like what like this is normal like he's just typing it I was like it's not a big deal but for me it was like wow you could do this with code it's like the most intelligent human being on the planet is by your side at all times for free why wouldn't you take advantage of that so when that happened you know you have to understand like the level of tolerance it takes is somebody who's not even making that much money it was young and I'm spending so much time into my chest a stick business making YouTube videos that weren't even getting that many views building a website taking a risk to call so many schools and hire a programmer for $400 and then we ended up getting our first client which you know who paid us $1,200 and so we made the money back later same thing when I was starting my clever programmer business I didn't have any money and I was taking out loans to freakin get my iMac so I can record video for you guys that make him high quality without even knowing I was gonna get any money on my return I bought lights professional lights my brother his name is will cause cause II he like edits videos for Netflix and stuff and he's really good at what he does so I remember asking him okay what kind of lights should I get equipment should I get and he was telling me that now I was paying buying those like essentially on loans so again more risk and more ambiguity like I don't know and then eventually you know it started picking up at some point like just a sec failed after like a year of hard work working with the team and everything but then for a clever programmer worked out well so how did you deal with just ethic failing did you look at it from a point of view of what did I learn here and move forward or did it actually hurt or was a mixture of gold oh I absolutely loved the whole experience and absolutely loved it I don't even understand when people are like like you know I had other people around me and they'd be like well you know what happened with your last business so why don't you just relax and hang out with us and I was just like what are you kidding me I learned skills that a CEO want or like when they're getting trained training companies have to pay like millions of dollars to train these people to teach them these skills essentially in my mind I was like becoming a millionaire like I put monetary value in my head to everything just to make it tangible so for example you know I'll be hanging out with somebody who had who has a lot of knowledge about things and even I'm hanging out with them and learning from them I'm thinking holy crap somebody like this who's in this position would be charging $500 to $1,000 an hour for this information during let's say a lesson or a meeting and I'm getting to hang out with them and learn all this so why shouldn't I spend more time with them it's essentially by spending five hours with them I've made $5,000 like I'm rich as hell so what like what is your view and money like from what I'm getting from listening to you it seems like you're approaching things from like it's an adventure and you don't seem to have as much fear around money and and paying things and and seeing the value to people and mentors and all this kind of stuff and real life experience so what is your kind of view on money and as well how important are mentors in the process and even paying a mentor to get valuable information how do you approach these things how would you look at it money is for me it was kind of like this play toy and the reason is cuz I never really had a normal job like I never had a ninetofive ever and I never will and there was a point in my life when I was about 16 or 17 something like that and I was gonna either go to or maybe 15 I can't remember but I was either gonna go the route of you know what my family always started off with which was like getting a security job or getting a chest job but the chest job was more like hourly and like more like freelancing and the pay difference was the chest job paid me $35 an hour whereas the other job paid me like $8 an hour or 825 an hour you know but it was fulltime and I remember going the chest job route and even that job was kind of like entrepreneurial like you never know what classes you're gonna get you actually have to work really hard to land other schools for the company so you can actually teach at those schools and even when you're running the class it's like I thought of it like public speaking so I was getting the chance to public speak did you have a public speaking in any stage or is that something to get over was that for something you didn't think of I still have fear of public speaking but I know like got more con when I start speaking I lose the fear I kind of know what makes me lose the fear which is like when I start talking and moving that helps me lose the fear but yeah I had not it's not that bad anymore we'll see when I'm in front of a crowd you know that would be a little bit different yeah but I think I'll be okay but yeah my it's you know it's hard to handle kids who are like 5 to 10 years old they're brutal they won't listen to you like you have to be authoritative and you have to show them that you can and you have to navigate through a lot of weird funky social situations with younger kids some of them just don't list and they don't care they're like human beings but without any politeness or political correctness so it's like you're dealing with either like really amazing or really like evil little human beings who have no fear and so once you get good at dealing with that you get good at dealing with a lot of difficult situations and public speaking situations and you had another question that I wanted to answer the mint or the the mentors yeah how important are they to you and yeah how important are they yeah so mint okay so the money thing that we were talking about earlier you know money was always like this I want to finish that off and then jump off to them onto the mentor question yeah but how I always saw money was this like really dynamic thing and it was basically an exchange of value that was happening so like let's say I was teaching you a lesson you know and I'm charging you fifty hundred dollars an hour or if you figured out a way to hang out with me essentially are making 100 dollars an hour every freaking hour without doing any work so you're becoming really rich but people just think of money in this super static way like you get money and you just collect it and you just save it up save it up and that's the only thing they know is money and how do you bet it you work a nine to five job and you just keep stashing this thing away yeah or you could hang out with really valuable people who could give you lots of freaking amazing valuable things that would cost you tens or twenty thousand dollars to get by yourself like there are people who are cha charge you $5,000 or $10,000 for one consultation now imagine you get to hang out with those people you're essentially making five to ten thousand dollars all the time sounds like a creative way to look at money and one thing yeah just one thing don't think you've know when I'm because a few years ago I was kind of thinking how do I find these mentors and then it's gonna be so hard how did you looking back and how did you come across these mentors how does it actually naturally come into your life as you mind moving towards things money I used money I what I did is instead of just stashing money like just big Tower and sitting on it what I did instead was all the money that I got let's say that I got money for four chests people were paying me $50 an hour or $35 an hour to do chess and it's not just for an hour I mean it's mostly 34 hours because drive time they're coming back but what I did is all the money that I got then let's say I wanted to learn a skill of table tennis or coding I hired mentor for coding and I paid them 35 or 50 dollars an hour you know system therapy up so uh yeah I was like one hour of my chess skill got me one hour of coding skill yeah and then what I wanted to do was get clients where I was charging more money so then if I just got to charge hundred dollars an hour to a client essentially I was getting two hours of a good programmers time yeah for one hour of my time and also if I got a good programmer at a cheaper price like let's say $30 $40 an hour essentially for you know one hour of my time I was getting two to three hours of somebody else's time now and I you know so people a lot of that times they'll be like oh why should I pay a lot of money let me just try to find the cheapest person possible but they forget that it's okay it's actually less valuable to you because if you get somebody for eight to ten dollars like they're not gonna be that great at their skill and you're losing like two to three hours of your time learning something that would have taken 15 minutes from somebody who's really good it's your time over money pretty much exactly yeah so instead of asking how could I hire somebody for really cheap think to yourself how can I make more money so I can hire more valuable person like that's really what it is and then you get your skills a lot faster in a shorter period of time exactly money the last thing I want to say end it off that that one with his money is just one way to hire a mentor that's what I was doing earlier now I'm becoming much better with just social skills and I'm trying to put myself in situations where I'm always either uncomfortable or challenged or feel intimidated and that's how I'm now connecting with really valuable people like you know even in LA that's what I'm trying to do so I'm connecting with people where they're making a lot of money or we're really successful and famous and now I'm learning those skills like that that's how I'm acquiring mentors now so either use money or use social skills perfect so let's get over to the technical skills no so if I want to learn a new skill one thing I've seen you do is talk about reverse engineering it so you look at the angle and you walk backwards could you explain that in the context of learning a coding programming language like Python for example just for the listeners what do you mean by reverse engineering so say for example what I did when I was working with you is that I wanted to learn Python we had a project we picked flasks and and I look at flasks and they broke it down into well you got the front end in the backend for the frontend of bootstrap okay when I went forward to go I know what you make you know I know what you mean okay so here's how I think of learning and I think the academic system has it completely dumb an unnatural way which I disagree with which is okay you want to learn soccer for your first time okay let's do this come to my class and then I'm gonna have go on my white chalk board and then I'm gonna write down notes and Syrian history about soccer for like the first few weeks and then the next week we go to kick the soccer ball and actually play with it what why no it's not gonna make any sense to you if you try to theoretically learn how to play soccer they're not gonna improve you have to play what soccer ball first then if you learn about it it's very relevant and everything makes sense so I think with learning what I try to do with coding when I'm teaching somebody coding I don't want to just start you off with bitwise operators and like weird esoteric knowledge that is only helpful for itself I want to start you off with let's see something complicated like a full website we make the entire website now you know holy crap like you can make a website with coding and oh my god this is real this is tangible you're excited and you've gone to play with it so everything makes sense in context now now what I do is now I take you and teach you bitwise operators and they're really boring stuff and guess what the boring stuff is not boring anymore because everything you're learning now you're like oh and I could use this to add this to my website or I could use this to add to this part of the code and it'll work so everything is in context not boring and it's relevant and you learn a lot faster like this so that's yeah so reverse engineer the way that you learn play bill learn I call it my eighty fifteen five instead of eighty twenty eighty percent of the time should be spent playing with something if you want to learn it like just naturally think about how animals learn to run to walk to hunt fifteen percent of the time should be spent actually trying to build something meaningful with it and five percent of the time should be spend just boring dry learning through a textbook or just watching a video passively perfect it actually now when you're talking about it the first thing I can remember when I did your beginners course in Python was the turtle module like remember kind of when I saw it like this is incredibly it was after a few days and that's where I really went like I can do this now so there's a huge thing for me I mean it's you getting immediate feedback too with the turtle because visually things are happening whereas most courses will have things we're just like some quantitative you have to get this math formula right and half the time you don't even know what you get the right result or the wrong result a visual that you can see what's happening and so it leads you in the right direction the other thing actually I do like about you too is that you recommend other courses and that actually supplement the knowledge that you recommend it courses in Udacity and Coursera and our other platforms which kind of supplement as I move along so it's not just all all action and stuff if there is some theory that's supplementing when I can understand it from the context that's right I know what I like and yes thing is I suppose how important it like from clever programming there's a community there the students there how important are other student than being in an environment where everybody's facing in the same direction everybody wants to learn a new skill oh and how do I find that if I feel like I'm in an area where nobody else is interested in programming how do I get over that and how do I find these people yeah oh my god it's so helpful like if you learned something by yourself something that would take you 15 days to learn let's say or 12 this learn by yourself if you're around people you'll learn that same thing in like two days maybe faster because oh so how you can actually get that where you can have those people around you is like I was at home and I would be learning this and I realized that it's gonna be really slow if I just learned this by myself so I'm gonna learn this with people and what I did is I got access to a coworking space I'm not sure if you know people who are watching this know what it is and if you don't know what it is coworking spaces are just like these places where you can pay hundred 200 ollars a month and essentially everybody just goes to work there so some of these people are like professionals that like you know maybe they're professional coders maybe they're professional video editors whatever they all go to this one space to work and you can just go there and work and so you'll find a lot of people who do coding there and you can learn from them and some of these are gonna mentor you that's how I found my first true mentor his name is Nick and I'm not so much in touch with him now I'm probably gonna call him soon after this maybe now that I remember but he was the reason I was able to learn programming so fast because he saw me and he took me under his wing and I met him at a place called ps1 in Chicago and it's a coworking space you can find spaces for even cheaper than hundred dollars a month but yeah coworking spaces are great and if you don't have the money for that meetup.com sorry man it's free it's like use it use those things go to those events they put events there you can go for free and also you can host your own meetup I have my own made up for clever programmer and I was getting people to my personal meetup and I got some clients that way as well hmm yeah I know I used me to quite a bit to add is a good recommendation now that you say that there's a coworking space that just open up and wrap mine is there recently that I saw and I didn't know that the term it was coworking spaces yeah I suppose the other thing is that I hear you talk about systems a lot and could you explain like how do i how would I develop a learning system is there something I can create straight away or is there something that develops over time okay so can you you want to be a little bit more specific than what you're asking I want to make sure that I answer specifically yeah like I suppose I want to learn I want to learn Python programming I'm starting off beginner level I've done the beginners course I want to take it further but I also wants to start developing a system so it makes it easier for me to keep doing it consistently every day and like half of this Pat carrot of carob doubt but I don't really know how to set up a system or I don't really even know what that means properly it yeah I guess I see what you're saying odd so I'm gonna give you a more general rule for this that's what I think you know um your viewers will also find very valuable it's the same thing with that you have with willpower and motivation and here's one example so willpower it's really hard to get that all the time and if you have your brain making decisions all the time you're gonna get exhausted and you're gonna make the easier decision okay let's say you're trying to diet and you keep having to make the decision to not eat cake you're gonna get exhausted you're gonna eat that damn cake now on the other hand let's say there's no cake at home at the house so you don't even have to make the decision yes or no that's better that's a system for getting healthier just don't have that food in your house don't let yourself you don't even give yourself that option same thing with willpower and motivation you know willpower is kind of like the energy you need to get the door moving and opening and a system or a system is like putting a doorknob once that door is open and now that door just stays opened okay so so let's say in the start you had to use willpower and a lot of energy to get you know start coding okay you have to learn a lot to make sure that it was the right thing for you you have to make sure that you weren't too dumb to learn it and once you start making progress in it that one day you decide to actually commit now that's you pushing and opening the door right the door is opening now what you have to do is put a doorknob in there because if you just keep holding it you're gonna get tired and the doors gonna close at some point so now doorknob is building a system in place that system for you could be scheduling it you know where you have it in your calendar that you're gonna be coding this time block so it's not even a choice like you just have to be doing it but let's say you don't have that discipline yet you need accountability so the other system you could put in place is go to meetup.com and for the next few weeks just booked out the damn events in advance so they're already in your calendar they're already booked out and you know you're gonna be going there and coding with them they have coding hours and they just have free working hours and you can go there just code during that time or book out a you know hire once a week you can do hourly session with a mentor online and even good mentor will cost you something like $50 an hour and you could do one session a week that's $200 a month it's not that much just freaking sell one thing on ebay every month extra and you get that $200 or put in a few extra hours at work and now you have one hour of mentoring every day already in your schedule you know you have to show up for it because you've paid for it and that's another trick to hold yourself accountable by paying for something so yeah those are the tools you can use and the systems you can build to make sure that that door is open and that doorknob is always there perfect for another thing that I think that you would have experienced would be compound compound learning and a lot of people we know about compounding in finance but I've also realized this compounding is applicable to learning and still starts building on top of each other and you've got points of references that you learned in other fields could you just speak a little bit about that kind of what's been your experience in the acceleration curve for learning new things because you've already learned things that are similar and you got strong reference points to learn a new thing from oh this is what I feel like the reason why for me it's better to code a lot at one point right like spend a lot of time doing that one thing rather than a little bit of time every day because um what happens with learning is that once it starts to click you start learning super fast like let's say that you just started off in chess and you have no idea how anything moves you have no idea how the rules work learning is very tough nothing makes sense if you even watch other people playing you're not gonna be learning it just hurts your head um but once let's see you get to a certain point where you go to your first tournament or maybe you just learned how to play how the pieces move in everything now you know other people other people are doing things you're a being you're like oh that's that trick they're using oh now I get what's happening so it's essentially like once you have that initial framework you start learning really fast and the better you are in something the faster you learn it and improve more so you know when you're trying to pick up a skill you want to get to that level where it's deep then when you're sort learning fast don't get frustrated in the start when you can't learn expect to not be able to learn in the start you know a lot of people will start picking up a skill like playing pool and right in there for a first game when they lose you know I'm talking about pool like snooker and when they lose they'll get really frustrated they're like oh I suck but once you lose like 50 games or 2030 games that's when you'll hit a point where you'll start learning fast and that's when you actually start improving super fast you just have to have that patience and go through that failure and the start and then you hit that sweet spot you go oh perfect so your view of the other is quite quite a bit different to the conventional senses it's oh dude I love failure I absolutely love failure if you don't fit like let's say you go to the gym and you're lifting like five pound dumbbells of course you're never failing but you're never improving you'll go home looking the same every time so if you can if you're failing you know when you're Jim for example if you're failing that's how you know that that's a weight you have to go to you know you have to work your way to I don't know why people see failure is so bad honestly if I don't fail at something I don't even like I don't even want to do it cuz I'm like that's all there is to it there's no depth to this thing so yeah enjoy failure use failure as your beacon to where you need to go it's like your GPS failure and fear is your GPS to life as well as the path to growth to its growth its growth is that my opinion a growth is what we're searching for and failure is a part of growth yes yes pretty much it yeah so where you are now what's the what's the current vision of recovery program are moving forward and what's the next thing that's coming up and both and some of the new things I want to do now is like run do public speaking events for a clever programmer where I'm meeting people in real life in different countries in different cities I don't even care if I get two people to show up at a certain spot like I want to go out there and like physically meet clever program or fans or just new people who are trying to learn because the difference that it makes being live is so much more than just even seeing video um and I want to try to do that and and help as many people as I can help myself in the process to like I'm learning more than even you guys you know in my videos when I'm speaking him that's why I like teaching because you learn so much and to be honest like I'm focusing less on actually the technical programming side because there's so much there's so many learning opportunities because what I'm realizing more and more is that it's not the technical things that are stopping people it's that behavior change to start learning coding programming to make a decision to do something to take action like those are the things that are stopping people I want to be specific more to the realm of computer programming so no not just general motivation like I want to motivate you guys to do coding you know become software developers but like I want to help people aim higher than just a job you know like I met this one friend who's making almost quartermillion dollars and he's about to work at snapchat now who's worked at Google and he's a software developer so I want to help people and tell them that they're it's not just sixfigure is not your barrier a software developer you can even make more money and then also that you can start your own company as a software developer you know so I want to teach people programming then later I'm gonna teach you how to maybe scale a freelancing agency that's one of the things I did in college I got so many clients for software development that I hired people who were high quality people and I basically was a middleman and just managed them and they did some of the software development and I was making money essentially just being a college so there are you know first you start off as a software developer then you can have your own freelancing agency if you want or run your own business and that's kind of the things that I want to teach people where I see the future of clever programmer going and I'm honestly really excited for it I even want to do boot camps with students where you know they fly out and we do like a boot camp with a group of students live you know just immersive like two to three days ten hours a day you know the whole life is about coding for those two or three days so yeah there are a lot of big things that I want to do moving forward yeah sounds great and what came up there now is what's your opinion on boot camps and the conventional computer science degree well what were you but where do you see it see things now do we need to glue them or I would say boot camps are better than I mean it's always tough but boot camps I prefer more than a college degree now I know there will be somebody will be like but college degrees for years long at boot camp is three months long well take the boot camp and then still keep learning don't stop learning you know just because a school system or a teacher is not teaching you it doesn't mean you stop learning also another important point I want to make it's college or both coding boot camp it's just one source of learning so always have multiple sources of learning like be learning by watching videos be learning by reading books be learning by building projects and then will be learning from a coding boot camp and be learning from a college so between college and coding boot camp prefer bootcamp because it's so immersive but just remember that after those three months still keep learning moving forward and bootcamp teaches you relevant skills it's always like uptodate most of the times and they teach you how to get a job right away whereas college focus is very little on the aspect of getting a job which is super weird because the only reason people graduate yes is to become knowledgeable but ultimately to get work and started getting paid for the things that they're doing you know yeah um yeah so my final question is what's your favorite book and and why because I happy I won is it that we were big on books and we love books and reading so I have so many favorite books can I mention multiple yep go freak go for it okay so depends where you are in life that's the important thing about books and what you need at that time so sometimes it's motivation you need and you'll recognize that when you're feeling low when you can't drag yourself out of bed when you can't produce content and you need that willpower and you can't say no to your friend who wants to hang out because you know you should be making the content or you should be writing a blog or you should be working on something but you're just like yeah okay fine let's go out let's do let's hang out for motivation and getting [ __ ] done read 10x by Grant Cardone amazing book one of the books that really changed my life for software developments just soft skills of software development and being more wellrounded getting the kick in the ass and then also kind of starting your own thing like YouTube channels and things like that Reid so software developers manual life manual by Johnson m'as okay I'm actually reading out of his books at the moment the complete software developers go ahead and I really find this stuff insightful it's not just coding it's also just your way of looking at things in Southfield and everything it's kind of combined into one hell yeah that was a reason my channel started by the way he's my he was my hero that's why my channel is called clever programmer sounds awfully similar to simple programmer and yeah now I'm gonna have more subs on him soon which is amazing because when I started I was I had zero and he was that like whatever subs um and hopefully I'll get to meet him one day and I'll I still see him as my mentor and I still respect him a lot so that's the second book I recommend if you want to become you know financially more financially independent and have better ways of thinking about money and life lessons I read Rich Dad Poor Dad unbelievable book completely will change your mind and how you think of money Rich Dad Poor Dad amazing book mmm 21 sleeping strategies I think it's called and that's a book that was another one that helped change my life because I started sleeping at 10 p.m. and I started waking up at 530 a.m. and the stuff that I got done by 10 or 11 a.m. I was already ahead of like 90% of the people in the world and then I had the rest of the day to conquer everything you know I'm 23 years old and from the last few years I've been hitting six figures doing software development now my business is hitting six figures and hopefully next year we'll be hitting seven figures so there's a sign that you know some of it is successful and has been giving me good results so that book is really good and then a few other books that aren't coming in my head right now but does that kind of answer the question well that's pretty well relman trees a good number to and I'll put the links to everything in the end in the notes in the video too even to your camera programmer calm is the site and if you want to go there and check out what Cassie is doing yeah I think that's a lot of information for one day it's really insightful stuff for for my Lister's in my audience and yeah just like thank our thank you again for taking the time to talk to us today and to give us your insights into how you've come about creating such a great a great thing in the world because people are actually doing more what you want to do that's what I've seen clever program where people are coming there they're also getting social skills is not just technical skills they're getting both they're getting a good balance so yeah thanks again for talking to us today no thanks so much this was unbelievable this brings so much value I want to be doing this actually more often honestly like this was freaking awesome yeah it's gonna bring so much value to your viewers like this was so good I'm gonna be watching this and getting value out of this yeah this is great and I want to use this for clever programmer as well as that cool yeah it's good with me perfect so until the next time and the next episode have fun and enjoy the process
