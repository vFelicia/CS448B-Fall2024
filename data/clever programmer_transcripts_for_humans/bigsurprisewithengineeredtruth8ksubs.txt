00:02 - clever programmer calm first of all I
00:04 - just wanted to say thank you so much for
00:06 - freaking eight thousand subscribers this
00:09 - is unbelievable I don't even know how
00:11 - fast for going and the craziest crap
00:15 - happened I just cannot believe that this
00:16 - has happened and I just wanted to share
00:18 - this with you guys the second I found it
00:19 - so i was watching engineer truth which
00:23 - is a awesome channel you guys should
00:25 - definitely watch it too he's sitting
00:27 - just over 150,000 subscribers and he
00:29 - said how much money does a youtuber with
00:32 - hundred fifty thousand subscribers make
00:33 - so I was like sure let's go and find out
00:36 - because as you guys know I started my
00:38 - youtube channel pretty recently about a
00:40 - few months ago and I wanted to see what
00:42 - the heck is going on and how much money
00:45 - does a youtuber make with over 150,000
00:48 - subscribers those cool videos watching
00:49 - it and then this happened yes you value
00:53 - titles you look at popular videos it's
00:56 - how did you do so how to code and how to
00:58 - prepare for Dominic okay so I saw this
01:02 - and I called over my friend Tenzin and I
01:05 - was like dude check this out this is
01:07 - crazy because where he says how to teach
01:09 - yourself code that's exactly the title
01:12 - of my video so we were both looking at
01:15 - this and we thought that was a really
01:16 - crazy coincidence because his video at
01:19 - the top one it says how to teach
01:21 - yourself code and the second one is how
01:23 - to prepare for a job interview so seeing
01:25 - the first one I was like that's crazy
01:27 - because one of my videos has the same
01:29 - title and then I kept watching and then
01:33 - this happened those two titles have very
01:36 - strong SEO value and if you type in
01:40 - those keywords that how those titles in
01:42 - to youtube I they believe my videos are
01:44 - number one at this time though of course
01:47 - it could always change okay see you my
01:49 - morning okay I get it that you gotta
01:51 - have these SEO friendly titles but how
01:53 - did you get your your video to be number
01:55 - one oh my god do you guys see that do
02:01 - you guys see that so I saw this and a
02:05 - totally freaking blew my mind I was like
02:08 - what I mean that is a pretty big title
02:11 - how to teach yourself code but more
02:13 - more than that well it's so crazy is
02:15 - that I pop up third so I was I mean I
02:21 - don't even know what to say it was
02:22 - blowing my mind so here's what I want
02:25 - you guys to do I left him a comment at
02:28 - the top and I want you to go and I just
02:31 - want you to smash that like button
02:33 - that's what I want you to do whoo it's
