00:05 - with my
00:06 - friend hey how's it going everybody I'm
00:09 - David uh or people call me Dr M and what
00:14 - are we going to be building today
00:16 - Frankie yo today we're going to teach
00:18 - them how to build Facebook clone with
00:21 - the mer stack so this is the app that
00:23 - you guys are going to build and David
00:25 - and I are going to show you I'm going to
00:27 - ask a few questions um pretty much a
00:29 - begin in coding hopefully I can bring
00:32 - light to you guys and ask David a few
00:33 - questions so as you can see we have
00:35 - Google authentication right here to sign
00:37 - in and I'm going to go ahead and sign
00:40 - in after that we can see all of this so
00:43 - what are we seeing on screen
00:45 - David so we see on the
00:49 - screen uh firstly the stories of course
00:53 - and then you can actually go ahead and
00:56 - like add a new post yep like if I go
01:00 - ahead and like type in
01:02 - Yo and hit the return it should update
01:05 - automatically because this thing is
01:08 - actually real time awesome yeah I saw
01:11 - you post it I just posted one too exctly
01:14 - let's
01:15 - see seems like it takes a little bit of
01:17 - time right
01:21 - mhm what do you mean it takes a little
01:24 - oh no it's it's right there I don't see
01:27 - mine let's see so I'll do yo and then
01:30 - what I'm going to do is type in yo
01:34 - what's up and then you can also add an
01:37 - image to it and then click
01:46 - enter so in the demonstration here guys
01:49 - apparently I can't see it refresh let me
01:52 - actually just reload the whole page
01:53 - because this is what you guys are going
01:54 - to be building right so there's three
01:55 - columns to it after you sign in with
01:57 - your actual Google account you should be
02:00 - loog prompt into this you you log in
02:03 - with your Google account once you're
02:05 - inside you can see what I was just
02:08 - posting so it's yo yo so it takes a
02:10 - little bit of time just cu the database
02:13 - has to be refreshed that one was a
02:14 - little bit faster so I typed in yo
02:17 - what's up people and then what I'm going
02:20 - to do is I'm going to add an image to it
02:22 - and I drag it there let's see how it
02:25 - appears
02:26 - boom so now you can see that I put the
02:29 - image and I'm like what's up people a
02:31 - little bit of a typo here so what are
02:33 - these three columns David this is kind
02:35 - of like um navigation we have a sidebar
02:39 - on the left with all the buttons from
02:43 - the actual Facebook and then in the
02:45 - middle we have the whole feed with all
02:48 - the
02:49 - posts and on the right hand side we have

02:57 - right yes on the right side so
03:00 - nice
03:03 - awesome so you want to you want to go
03:06 - into the build you want to show them how
03:07 - to build this so let's go let's do it
03:10 - awesome man so what I'm going to do then
03:12 - uh I think I think our live chat just

05:37 - I got a new link here let me share it
05:39 - with you on Skype here we go sorry for
05:43 - the technical difficulties guys stick
05:45 - with us you guys are going to learn how
05:46 - to build Facebook with the M Stack this
05:49 - is you know this is part of being a
05:50 - developer guys you know sometimes you
05:52 - need to have your environment ready and
05:55 - sometimes it gives you a little bit of
05:56 - problems but it's just a reflection of
05:57 - what goes on in the real world
06:01 - exactly like this couldn't get any more
06:03 - Reed that's what I always say exactly
06:07 - exactly problems are are part of our
06:10 - Lives okay now I'm connecting I'm
06:13 - joining the collab session awesome
06:15 - awesome so I'm going to go ahead and
06:17 - play a little bit more with the with the
06:19 - actual demo demo is awesome so one of
06:22 - the things that I like the most off the
06:24 - bat it's the way that it's organized
06:26 - right so you guys can see here all of
06:28 - these little icons I believe these were
06:30 - made with materialized right
06:33 - materialized yeah everything is uh
06:35 - actually let's talk a little bit about
06:37 - uh the stack that we will be using
06:41 - so for the front end we are using react
06:46 - as you uh as you
06:48 - know but um we also use material UI for
06:54 - all the icons up there and we are using
06:58 - uh material UI input uh when we are uh
07:02 - uploading
07:04 - files and we also will be using the
07:07 - react context API which is uh kind of
07:11 - new for me too so I'll try to explain it
07:14 - the best I can uh but if something is
07:19 - not clear I highly recommend everybody
07:21 - goes ahead and watches uh Sun's video
07:24 - because he is the react master of our
07:27 - team um but we will be using react
07:30 - context API and then let's turn to the
07:33 - back end so on the back end as you
07:36 - already know we will be using mongod DB
07:40 - we will be using expressjs and nodejs
07:44 - and we will also be using something
07:46 - called The Grid FS of uh mongod DB and
07:52 - grid FS actually will allow us to upload
07:56 - images to mongod DB Direct directly so
08:00 - until up until this time we were using
08:04 - uh Firebase to upload images and then we
08:06 - used the links that Firebase generated
08:11 - but this time we will take it another
08:13 - level deeper and we will be
08:17 - using um mongod DB completely for uh
08:22 - storing every single thing right I I
08:26 - remember this is this was a highly
08:28 - requested
08:30 - um highly requested feature to do so we
08:34 - here you guys we are building it for you
08:38 - today um once I'll be able to join the
08:44 - collab
08:46 - session progress here
08:49 - disconnection um I'm not in
08:53 - there
08:58 - um
09:00 - let's go and let's try
09:08 - to something on
09:11 - the connection part is not working
09:16 - out some people are saying that my voice
09:19 - is low is it low guys let me see I'm
09:21 - going to move it a little bit up so
09:24 - hopefully this sounds a little bit
09:26 - better maybe inside wrong editor window
09:28 - somebody
09:35 - saying okay so for some reason the live
09:38 - share doesn't seem to be
09:41 - working um maybe we can start it from
09:44 - scratch yeah yeah let's do it let's
09:46 - let's start it from scratch oh hold on
09:48 - it just uh loaded for me now WIS code is
09:52 - opening at the moment and let's hope it
09:56 - sets up great and and we will be able to
10:00 - start the build awesome I see that you
10:03 - joined okay now I'm following you
10:06 - awesome yo back in the game guys this is
10:10 - how we do it exactly so you guys already
10:14 - saw what we're going to build it looks
10:16 - pretty freaking fun make sure to stick
10:18 - around you guys are going to be building
10:19 - this the Facebook clone with a M Stack
10:21 - ey frame over here the stories over here
10:23 - we're going to be using mongod DB and as
10:26 - you were saying David what is the M
10:28 - Stack contain what does it mean so M
10:31 - Stack is made out of mongod DB expressjs
10:37 - reactjs and um no JS sorry I had to
10:42 - think a little okay let me see I'm going
10:44 - write that down so the bur stack pretty
10:46 - much consists of mongod DB that's right
10:51 - and then it also I'm going to actually
10:54 - Express
10:55 - JS so Express whoops
11:02 - okay during that time I'll start
11:05 - deleting all these files and so we can
11:09 - start the
11:10 - build
11:13 - thenb then it's also
11:17 - expressjs
11:19 - Express
11:21 - JS then it's
11:25 - also Redux what's the r on the mer no re
11:30 - uh react react it is react react reactjs
11:34 - and nodejs is the last
11:37 - one and
11:39 - nodejs so all of these things are going
11:42 - to be things that we're going to be
11:43 - using today all of these Technologies
11:45 - and so that pretty much is the mer stack
11:48 - it is one of the most used and popular
11:50 - stacks for for actual what's it called
11:54 - web development right now so David I
11:57 - wasn't following you now I'm following
11:59 - you soing out the space for
12:02 - everybody okay uh now I'll try to delete
12:05 - all these
12:06 - files and actually start typing in the
12:15 - terminal are you sharing the terminal
12:17 - too let me see so share terminal so sh
12:23 - terminal there's one and then I
12:26 - click bash yeah read and right uh it
12:29 - should be
12:32 - good okay um I don't see let's actually
12:35 - not mess around with the terminal if you
12:37 - can go ahead and type in npx create
12:40 - react

12:47 - app and like name it Facebook
12:51 - M
12:54 - um oh oops I how did I click enter so
12:58 - after the okay okay so it will be named
13:01 - my react app uh it's all good so you

14:19 - going to get a little bit impatient but
14:22 - if not guys we got it all handled you
14:24 - know like I said before this is all part
14:27 - of the coding environment sometimes you
14:28 - run into to problems but it's you know
14:31 - what makes you stick through those
14:32 - problems that gives you that skill gives
14:34 - you that you know that actual that
14:38 - actual will to keep on coding and keep
14:40 - on getting better with your skills so
14:42 - right now we're just waiting for David

20:45 - terminal one okay I see you now let's
20:48 - see okay awesome awesome okay so I'll go
20:51 - ahead and delete yo. JS cuz we don't
20:54 - need that that was just for testing
20:56 - purposes and now as in the terminal I
21:00 - will uh start creating the react app now
21:03 - guys thanks you so much if you stick
21:05 - with us and and you're here with us now
21:09 - uh it finally looks like that we were
21:11 - able to troubleshoot every single thing
21:14 - because we had issues with audio we had
21:16 - issues with connection we had issues
21:17 - with live share but now it's all set and
21:21 - that deserves an air horn I believe
21:25 - exactly love that nice
21:29 - let's jump into okay yeah let's jump in
21:31 - okay so we will be starting uh up
21:35 - the we will be starting building the app
21:39 - with the front end so let's actually
21:42 - everybody go ahead and create a react
21:44 - app with the good old MPX create react
21:48 - app um command and I'll be calling the
21:53 - project name uh Facebook react and I
21:58 - think that's a pretty good name and I'll
22:01 - just go ahead and like hit return now
22:04 - it's going to take a little bit of time
22:06 - while it loads uh but don't worry this
22:09 - will do everything for us now uh on the
22:12 - left hand side you can see that it's
22:15 - already creating a folder with the
22:18 - package.json
22:20 - file
22:22 - and yeah um so on the front end we will
22:28 - be using like I said react we will be
22:31 - using react context API we will be using
22:35 - uh material UI and we will build the
22:39 - whole thing with lots of
22:42 - components um so while actually that is
22:46 - loading yo what's up with the phone
22:49 - Instagram stories let's go Facebook live
22:52 - hey what's up so I think you can go
22:57 - ahead and and open up a browser and
23:00 - start setting up our database so if you
23:03 - could go ahead and open up
23:05 - Chrome and share it with everybody
23:09 - um so let's go to mongodb
23:14 - domcom because we will be using mongodb
23:20 - right so mongod db.com is the thing yeah
23:25 - and I have no clue if if you guys have a
23:30 - have an account or not but in the middle
23:33 - there is a start here button you can uh
23:35 - go ahead and easily sign up right
23:38 - there um and it's actually a free nosql
23:42 - database service that we are going to be
23:46 - using
23:49 - so Frankie you want to go ahead and set
23:52 - up mongodb so how do we go ahead and do
23:54 - that just give me direction let's go and
23:56 - let's go and just uh hit the middle
23:58 - button uh the start here button uh right
24:02 - in the middle of the screen it yep
24:06 - that's the one and you can go with
24:08 - Google sign in that's going to be the
24:10 - easiest way to go about
24:13 - it and select whatever account you want
24:17 - to go
24:21 - with
24:23 - and okay now it's going to take a little
24:25 - time yeah just accept everything thing
24:28 - and submit guys this is literally the
24:30 - process of signing up to mongod DV so if
24:33 - you haven't already this is how it looks
24:36 - like and this is a stepbystep uh guide
24:41 - on how to go ahead and start up with
24:44 - your first very first mongod DB database
24:48 - right so up here it shows like uh let's
24:52 - get your account set up you just want to
24:54 - go ahead and uh click JavaScript down
24:57 - there
24:58 - there and just go with the green button
25:01 - uh on the bottom right hand side uh and
25:04 - you want to go with the create free
25:07 - cluster and that is what we will be
25:10 - using so there is nothing to set up here
25:14 - uh you can leave everything just the way
25:16 - it is now and you can just go ahead and
25:19 - uh create the
25:21 - cluster awesome this is awesome if you
25:24 - guys are barely starting out you can see
25:25 - the whole process from the beginning so
25:28 - right now we're setting up mongod
25:30 - DB exactly
25:33 - exactly
25:36 - um okay uh
25:40 - B yeah
25:46 - and oh I think I think I I think we see
25:49 - saw everything
25:54 - okay okay for some reason the great
25:57 - react app
25:59 - um just
26:03 - failed uh okay so now it's going to uh
26:07 - take a little while while it loads
26:10 - up
26:13 - uh so mongodb is pretty much what is it
26:17 - the database right so yeah exactly it's
26:19 - it's like a it's a no SQL database right
26:23 - so something like
26:25 - firee exactly so this is a no SQL
26:28 - database we are not going to be using
26:31 - any kind of uh SQL stuff like normally
26:34 - you would use with uh with of course SQL
26:39 - uh it's a lot more easier to set up
26:42 - and and it's a lot easier to work with
26:47 - uh in my opinion and for beginners I
26:50 - think it's um it's a it's a great way to
26:53 - start uh working with databases right
26:56 - what's your what's your take on on that
26:58 - to be honest the only experience that I
27:00 - have with these nosql databases is
27:03 - Firebase and you know I like it a lot
27:06 - just because it's it's very real time so
27:09 - it doesn't you know everybody can use it
27:11 - it's free you know for most personal
27:13 - projects it's free and it's a good
27:15 - combination to use with react but today
27:17 - you know we wanted to switch it up a bit
27:18 - for you guys and actually teach you guys
27:20 - how to use the mer stack and so you know
27:24 - exactly actually we will be making
27:26 - mongod DB real time as well so that's if
27:30 - if uh if you're pumped about that just
27:32 - drop some love in the comment section or
27:35 - something drop a fire Emoji if you're
27:38 - pumped about
27:40 - um making the mango DB uh real time and
27:47 - actually at the at this
27:50 - time um the create react app is
27:55 - running and I think it should be done in
27:59 - any
28:00 - minute and hopefully it will be very
28:03 - soon so this is still running right here
28:06 - so we're just waiting for that as well
28:08 - exactly yeah yeah so right now what is
28:10 - it doing is it connecting between these
28:12 - two nope uh so on mango mongod DB is
28:17 - currently building the cluster where uh
28:20 - all the where we will be so it's
28:22 - basically setting up a server to run our
28:25 - database uh and great rack app is like
28:29 - going a totally other
28:31 - way uh it's just creating uh a front and
28:34 - application for
28:37 - us other than that uh so these are not
28:40 - connecting at the
28:43 - moment um but yeah we will be connecting
28:46 - them very soon two different processes
28:49 - going on at the same
28:52 - time oh your computer
28:55 - is sing too
28:59 - a I see I see okay uh now it's
29:02 - installing all the note packages as far
29:05 - as I can see yeah okay by the time
29:09 - so
29:11 - actually uh the cluster got set up so
29:14 - you can go back to mongod DB and let's
29:18 - actually set the whole thing up so on
29:20 - the left hand side there is a network
29:22 - access uh button you can go ahead and
29:24 - click that says network access on the
29:29 - left hand side yeah in the in the nav
29:32 - bar here we go yeah so you want to click
29:34 - network access and just go ahead and add
29:37 - an IP address and it will pop up a
29:41 - little screen but just go ahead and hit
29:44 - allow access from
29:46 - anywhere uh it's up yeah that's the one
29:49 - and if it's 0000 Z that's good just go
29:52 - ahead and confirm
29:55 - that and
30:01 - loading up pending that's cool that's
30:04 - good and you can go on the database
30:07 - access as
30:10 - well now my connection is lost again
30:13 - to
30:15 - the live share yeah live share and it
30:19 - says the same thing uh the host host of
30:22 - the workspace seems to be
30:24 - offline which is uh qu so let's let's
30:28 - set this up first and then I'll go ahead
30:29 - and just redo the same process okay so
30:32 - let's go and just uh add a new database
30:35 - user and then you can just type in admin
30:39 - uh right there exactly and like create
30:42 - autogenerate a cql password that's uh
30:46 - yep and you want to go ahead and copy
30:48 - that and yeah and just save it somewhere
30:50 - save because this is the last time you
30:53 - will be able to do this and we will be
30:55 - using it uh once we want to to connect
30:58 - to uh mongod DB right so you want to
31:02 - have it uh somewhere safe and just go
31:04 - ahead and add
31:06 - the uh add add the
31:09 - user with the green button at the uh
31:13 - buttom yeah that's the one you want to
31:15 - click it's going to go ahead and create
31:18 - all the stuff now it's actually um
31:23 - creating the rule uh to
31:29 - creating the rule uh to be able to um
31:33 - connect the database from anywhere with
31:36 - that user MH and right now it's uh my vs
31:41 - code says I'm unable to connect to to
31:45 - the host so we got the database ready
31:47 - what I'm going to do is I'm actually
31:48 - going to X command Q out of it and I'm
31:50 - going to reop it so visual studio code
31:54 - and then wait up till it loads after
31:57 - we're in here what I'm going to do is
31:58 - I'm going to start a collaboration
32:00 - session command shift p and then start
32:03 - collaboration session that's right I'm
32:06 - starting
32:07 - it uh so youone need to sign in with
32:10 - GitHub sign in with GitHub let's
32:14 - go yeah
32:17 - and yeah I think you can use Club
32:21 - programmer that's cool and
32:25 - authorize and with the
32:29 - done okay cool was this computer reset
32:33 - by the way started maybe yeah MH I see
32:39 - okay uh now you should be able to uh
32:42 - drop me a link I'll drop you the new
32:44 - link let's drop it in chat for you so
32:47 - now what I'm doing is I'm inviting David
32:48 - to the collaboration session again
32:50 - apparently it seems like it cuts off
32:51 - after a little bit of a while of
32:53 - inactivity so we're about to join the
32:56 - same coding session and from there we're
32:59 - going to teach you guys how to build the
33:00 - Facebook merge stch so now we got the
33:03 - mongodb database set up right David
33:07 - exactly yeah right I see here that you
33:09 - just joined the collaboration session
33:11 - okay and I think I'm going to need uh
33:14 - read write access to the so I'm share
33:17 - server with you right no it popped up on
33:20 - the bottom right and you can go ahead
33:22 - and make the terminal read and right
33:24 - okay awesome
33:28 - okay uh Focus terminal it's not
33:31 - currently editing assured document
33:34 - says yeah
33:39 - um okay now for and also cre react app
33:44 - failed for some
33:46 - reason
33:49 - um so I see you now I'm following you
33:52 - now okay perfect I see that you wrote
33:54 - the names Facebook react
33:57 - or Dash that's a problem because that's

34:20 - M front
34:25 - and and let's go ahead and hit
34:30 - return okay now it's starting up the
34:33 - react project again because for some
34:35 - reason it just failed last
34:39 - time sorry guys for all the technical
34:43 - difficulties part of the journey exactly
34:46 - now you learn learn from our mistakes
34:48 - don't make these mistakes
34:51 - guys
34:52 - yeah so right now we're giving it a
34:55 - little bit of time for the react app to
34:58 - load yeah but like I mean everybody has
35:01 - now time to follow us and actually guys
35:03 - if you have any questions drop them in
35:05 - the chat and now is the time to answer
35:08 - some stuff I think yeah also guys if you
35:11 - guys are enjoying this content which we
35:13 - still haven't gotten into the meet make
35:15 - sure to follow us on Instagram IG David
35:18 - ri. JS he's dropping amazing content
35:22 - there for JavaScript and just I just
35:24 - want to say David you know your skills
35:26 - in in react and JavaScript and
35:27 - everything have been you know very
35:31 - refined uh you know throughout these few
35:33 - months it's it's amazing the skill level
35:35 - that you
35:37 - require yeah I I'll I tried my best to
35:42 - uh reach as as high as
35:45 - possible um so yeah but I mean it
35:48 - required crazy amount of work yeah right
35:51 - you can't there's no there's no such
35:53 - thing like a shortcut I mean there's no
35:55 - shortcut in coding
35:57 - you have to put in the work guys you
35:58 - have to put in the time you know it's
36:01 - all pretty much process of repetition
36:03 - and you know that's what's going to
36:05 - build your
36:06 - skill exactly I know David has been
36:09 - going live you know this past week with
36:11 - sunny creating crazy amounts of builds
36:14 - and now this is going to be a really
36:16 - really good one as
36:19 - well okay so now it says I have to
36:23 - agree uh the X code license agreement
36:28 - um space space yeah space space space
36:32 - lot of
36:33 - space okay uh so it's
36:37 - running I think it's needed for for the
36:41 - Git Version Control I
36:46 - see oh
36:52 - okay agreeing admin privileges okay uh
36:57 - we might need
36:58 - to um rerun the
37:07 - thing do you have xcode installed on the
37:09 - computer by the way xcode I mean I
37:12 - should but we need X code that's uh just
37:16 - to yeah just open it up uh I think I
37:19 - think it's because uh xcode was updated
37:22 - so just open it up and you need to agree
37:26 - all the licenses so everybody yeah go
37:29 - ahead and just
37:30 - agree and you will need like an admin
37:33 - password to agree there and guys if you
37:35 - are on Mac and you have xcode installed
37:39 - and it's
37:40 - updated uh then probably you will need
37:43 - to go through this process as well I've
37:45 - I've had to do it with both of my Macs
37:49 - and and yeah uh without that you are not
37:52 - able to create a g version controlled uh
37:56 - project
37:57 - so yeah by the time do we got any
38:00 - questions so why are we using xcode
38:02 - because xcode is used to make you know
38:04 - iOS development apps right so yeah so
38:07 - it's actually just because we are using
38:10 - MacBook and when you're using a Mac uh
38:14 - git is built into xcode and and the part
38:17 - of uh Apple's infrastructure and it was
38:21 - recently updated uh to I think I think
38:24 - xcode 12 is the new version so you can
38:27 - you know that you have the fresh version
38:30 - if the hammer on the icon is black so if
38:33 - it's still silver you don't have to
38:35 - worry about all this stuff uh you only
38:37 - have to worry about it if you have it uh
38:40 - have the hammer black right makes sense
38:44 - so we just need to do that and
38:47 - like yeah it's kind of like the Apple
38:50 - stuff yeah I've actually used X code
38:52 - before it's it's really good it's kind
38:54 - of a heavy IDE to use but to be honest
38:57 - with you compared to you know Android
38:58 - Studio which was what I was using before
39:00 - that man Android Studio is so heavy it's
39:03 - so exact yeah compared to Android Studio
39:07 - it's a simple ID yeah exactly Android
39:10 - Studio is just it's like coding in Java
39:13 - like you just need so so
39:15 - much yeah like actually there are a lot
39:18 - of memes where people like putting uh
39:21 - some meat on their computer when before
39:24 - opening Android Studio because it's
39:26 - going to uh heat up so
39:29 - much oh yeah meme time I'm guessing yeah
39:33 - let SP out something so this is still
39:35 - loading guys it's going to take a little
39:37 - bit of a time I see actually xed out of
39:40 - it let's see where it's
39:43 - at so now here we go so we're a little
39:47 - bit more than halfways done so yeah okay
39:51 - cool now let's let's respond to a few
39:53 - questions cuz I know you guys are very
39:54 - active right now know yeah exactly let
39:58 - me so hope continue the back end with
40:01 - Mongoose do we use Mong in this we will
40:04 - be using Mongol that is right we will be
40:06 - using Mongol and we will be using grid
40:10 - FS with
40:13 - um for for [ __ ] TB and the back end
40:16 - stuff
40:19 - awesome so okay let's see another
40:22 - question so Rak rukaya asks why
40:26 - functional components over class
40:29 - components um guess what man we got a $5
40:32 - donation by tane Blake thank you so much
40:35 - that deserves an air horn let's get
40:39 - it awesome thank you so much to Dane
40:42 - appreciate you man you w to you want to
40:45 - answer that question what's it saying
40:46 - what's it saying uh let's first answer
40:48 - the question the first one okay so why
40:51 - not class class-based components first
40:54 - I'm not too confident with class based
40:56 - comp components that's the main reason
40:58 - probably but second of all actually
41:01 - functional components are are the future
41:04 - right clause-based components are
41:07 - outdated uh nobody is you like yeah
41:10 - there are lots of companies which are
41:12 - still using cloudbased components but
41:15 - they will be uh starting to trans uh
41:18 - transcode everything to
41:20 - functional uh we just I mean the world
41:23 - is changing everything is changing the
41:25 - way you code is changing and everything
41:28 - is moving towards to functional
41:31 - components right and it's much easier uh
41:34 - to learn and to master
41:38 - because I mean functional components are
41:41 - so much easier to write and with with
41:44 - class-based components that's what uh
41:46 - sunny and I are always laugh at that is
41:48 - the this keyword and you have to put it
41:51 - some random uh places and it's just not
41:53 - beginner friendly at all so we're just
41:56 - not not doing that uh up here I think we
41:59 - will be dropping a couple of contents on
42:02 - how to how to use that um but just later
42:06 - on all right uh let's see another one
42:10 - let's see the donation question danne
42:12 - Blake he donated $5 thank you so much
42:15 - man he asks thanks a lot hey let me
42:17 - actually take a picture of it so you
42:18 - guys can actually see this so he asks
42:21 - hey first time catching a live
42:23 - stream nice up welcome dude see if I can
42:28 - actually zoom into it so you guys can
42:29 - check it
42:32 - out
42:37 - mhm saying hey first time catching a
42:40 - live stream discover this channel couple
42:42 - days ago thanks for all the videos I'm
42:43 - learning a lot thank you so much man
42:46 - make sure to stick around bro cuz we're
42:48 - going heavy on the content this past
42:51 - month we were having a a conference
42:53 - meeting a little bit ago and we realized
42:55 - that we put out 100 videos on YouTube
42:59 - the last 3 months pretty much is almost
43:02 - every day dropping videos every day so
43:04 - you know that's that's our plan still
43:06 - we're going to continue doing that right
43:07 - now we're waiting for this the xcode to
43:11 - install its component so that we can
43:13 - proceed with the code but you know this
43:15 - is one of the builds that you guys are
43:17 - going to be building the Facebook mer
43:18 - stack build and it's actually the new
43:21 - Facebook UI right David that's correct
43:25 - that's correct we are not not going with
43:26 - the old stuff we are always going the
43:30 - with the newest stack and the newest
43:31 - stuff so yeah we normally try to see you
43:36 - know what what is the most popular thing
43:37 - in in the industry what type of you know
43:40 - market share you know each programming
43:42 - language has I know that right now the
43:44 - mer stack is really one of the most
43:46 - popular Stacks Tech stacks for web
43:48 - development and you know we're tackling
43:51 - all of the projects that we've made
43:52 - before with react and Firebase but now
43:55 - using the M
43:57 - Stack that is right that is right so
44:00 - okay it's almost finished installing
44:03 - it's almost like what 80% nice nice
44:06 - awesome awesome so let's take a few
44:08 - questions as that is loading so somebody
44:11 - asks Mr H asks hey guys do you have any
44:16 - resources to learn how to catch a
44:20 - Donley uh what never mind a I don't know
44:24 - what that is if anybody knows what that
44:26 - is drop it in the comments below he will
44:29 - please explain what's that uh I see the
44:32 - last one is tagging me yeah David could
44:35 - you please explain how to update the
44:36 - active status of the context on Real
44:38 - Time
44:39 - basis so the active status of okay can
44:44 - you like make it like
44:48 - huge then we'll make it
44:52 - big okay could you please explain how do
44:55 - you update the AC status of status
44:58 - contacts on a real time basis um I don't
45:02 - think I catch the question the essence
45:05 - of what you're trying to ask but we will
45:08 - be using the react context API and we
45:12 - will be uh shooting into it every single
45:15 - time when the uh application reloads and
45:19 - we will be adding the new uh signed in
45:23 - person but because react actually has
45:26 - like a short-term memory whenever you
45:29 - refresh it will be wiped out and you
45:31 - will need to sign in again and that is
45:34 - the thing uh that is the user that we
45:36 - will be adding to the context API I hope
45:39 - it answered your question by the
45:42 - way awesome then aara says maybe you
45:45 - could use
45:47 - sockets are we using soet we could we
45:50 - could use sockets but that's a lot of
45:53 - headache to set up so we we we will be
45:57 - using uh Pusher to make [ __ ] DB real
46:01 - time okay MX
46:04 - create um now I'm just testing out if
46:07 - it's working in the
46:12 - background make sure I have that so that
46:14 - everybody can see npx
46:16 - create-react-app yeah I'm just trying to
46:19 - create the app again and delete the
46:21 - other one that was uh that stopped uh
46:26 - there and FAL asks can you please save
46:29 - the stream when you guys are done yes so
46:32 - all of these streams are going to be
46:34 - uploaded to our YouTube channel if you
46:36 - guys want to see it you know on your own
46:38 - time you can just always go back to it
46:40 - and you know make sure to leave a
46:42 - comment if you guys are getting any you
46:43 - know good things to learn from it also
46:47 - you know the love that you guys bring to
46:48 - us you know we love this community it's
46:50 - insane really just drives us to to build
46:54 - more and more projects right David
46:57 - exactly that's right that's
47:00 - right okay
47:02 - um now it's loading I think we will cut
47:06 - this part out uh from the uploaded
47:09 - version mhm just so we can save you guys
47:11 - a little bit of time yeah exactly if
47:14 - somebody wants to rewatch it uh you can
47:17 - just watch the watch the uh cut version
47:20 - so right now um so right now what are we
47:23 - doing is it's we're working on what
47:26 - specifically so we are creating another
47:28 - react app uh with the accepted
47:32 - stuff uh so we are setting up the front
47:34 - end at the moment okay so I'm going to
47:36 - put that so that people can see setting
47:39 - up front
47:42 - end and awesome so we will be working on
47:46 - the look and fail of the
47:51 - app yeah uh you can actually X out that
47:55 - file that you're in at the
47:57 - moment
47:59 - um I'm creating a new
48:02 - one
48:04 - nice
48:07 - and you can accept that
48:12 - too okay I hope I really hope this time
48:16 - will be going cool and I think we
48:19 - accepted everything so we we should be
48:22 - good to go
48:24 - now

52:52 - that's what we wanted to see so guys if
52:54 - you are at this point it's a good place
52:56 - to be that is where we will be start
52:59 - going off okay uh let's go back to vs
53:03 - code right now and let's actually do our
53:06 - cleanup process awesome should I follow
53:08 - you so now yeah now now you should be
53:10 - following me so I'll be showing around
53:14 - uh you guys and if you pass a command J
53:18 - we will close up the terminal and if you
53:20 - press a command B it will close up the
53:22 - left bar so we will have more uh space
53:25 - on the screen for the
53:27 - code and actually if you could uh put
53:30 - the uh running react app next to the
53:32 - code that would be awesome Okay cool so
53:35 - we got this here and then running react
53:38 - app
53:39 - here yeah that's awesome
53:45 - okay there we go so this is react app ex
53:49 - out of the terminal um press command j
53:52 - instead I don't know if it stops the
53:54 - terminal or not
53:56 - just okay awesome okay so I'll be um
54:00 - I'll be showing the um cleanup process
54:04 - so first thing first we need to delete
54:08 - uh the second line which is importing
54:10 - the logo then we will need to actually
54:13 - delete everything uh inside of the div
54:16 - and I just uh like to start up the
54:18 - project with a H1 and like say hello
54:23 - clever programmers
54:26 - and now I saved it it should be some it
54:30 - should be rerender the whole page on the
54:32 - right hand side on of uh Frankie screen
54:37 - we saw right now that it it made it had
54:39 - a little bit of an error when you
54:40 - started typing and then all of a sudden
54:42 - it's refresh right yeah let's let's do a
54:46 - refresh I think it should be good
54:49 - now L clev programmers nice that's the
54:53 - one that that's the thing we wanted to
54:54 - see okay now let's go back to WS
54:57 - code and press command
55:01 - B okay and let's show the F let's show
55:05 - them the files because currently we are
55:08 - deleting all the test files so there was
55:10 - an app. test.js file I've already went
55:13 - ahead and deleted that now I'm actually
55:16 - deleting the setup test.js file right so
55:20 - we do not need those files you can just
55:23 - go ahead and get rid of them and now I'm
55:25 - also deleting the logo.svg file and this
55:30 - is something that we call the cleanup
55:34 - process so now we can actually uh
55:38 - hide the left hand side uh pressing
55:42 - command
55:43 - B and now we have all the things ready
55:47 - okay so I'm just going to go ahead and
55:49 - like mask things out um so we're
55:52 - starting off doing the front end right
55:55 - exactly I'm just going to sketch out a
55:57 - couple of stuff so that we know what we
56:00 - will be building so the app actually
56:02 - consists of three main parts one of them
56:06 - will be the
56:08 - sidebar uh the next one will be the
56:11 - actual feed and the third one will be
56:15 - it's kind of like the
56:17 - widgets and actually we're getting short
56:19 - in time so I'll be running uh pass
56:22 - through it like pretty fast uh the front
56:25 - and
56:26 - stuff so that everybody is getting as
56:29 - much value as possible guys feel free to
56:32 - stop the video at any time and just uh
56:35 - go ahead and try to build it at your own
56:39 - base but I actually recommend everybody
56:41 - just watching it and then uh try out the
56:45 - whole thing again after the live right
56:48 - and now it's the time for you to ask
56:50 - questions uh Sunny if you can go ahead
56:53 - and uh pop me any questions and like
56:56 - stop me at any time that would be
56:57 - awesome awesome with that said let's
57:01 - jump straight into building it okay so
57:06 - we will actually first have a
57:08 - Heather uh which is not in the jotting
57:11 - down so I'll just uh pop in header right
57:14 - here uh
57:17 - nice and let's actually create a
57:22 - folder uh which you can do by opening up
57:25 - the left side with command
57:27 - B and there is up top there is a little
57:32 - uh button which you can hit and say uh
57:37 - like name name the new folder components
57:39 - which I'm doing right now so we have a
57:43 - new folder called components I think
57:45 - yeah it's it's right inside of source
57:47 - nice and I'm adding a header. JS
57:52 - file and as well as a a
57:55 - header uh.
57:58 - CSS so guys with the um throughout this
58:03 - build we will be using es7 Snippets it's
58:06 - actually a nice little extension um that
58:10 - you can download for free for vs code
58:12 - and it allows me to code very quickly so
58:15 - if I go ahead and type in R off R
58:20 - afce uh that will create a react Arrow
58:23 - function component and will export it
58:26 - right so it's literally the initials of
58:28 - these words so if you kind of like know
58:31 - what your uh what you want to build uh
58:33 - you can actually create like a react
58:35 - class based component I think which is
58:39 - RCC right so that's actually a
58:41 - class-based component but uh and what
58:43 - Sunny likes to use is a
58:46 - react uh functional
58:48 - component and but I I actually prefer
58:52 - rafc because that will create an error
58:55 - function uh which for some reason what's
58:58 - up what's an arrow function for those
59:00 - that don't know yeah exactly exactly
59:03 - that's the as6 standard okay with that
59:07 - done I have actually created the header.
59:11 - JS
59:12 - file and now is the time to open up the
59:15 - terminal once again and I will stop the
59:18 - application from
59:21 - running can you open up the terminal
59:23 - with the command J
59:25 - there we go okay perfect and now I'm
59:28 - going to go ahead and start uh start
59:32 - importing a couple of dependencies so
59:34 - first thing first I'll be importing
59:38 - um material UI so I'm just going to go
59:41 - ahead and type in mpm install uh at
59:46 - oh mpm install at
59:49 - Material uh-
59:52 - UI oh um what's happening in the
59:59 - terminal oh okay so it's just uh bugging
60:02 - out for me mpmi at
60:06 - material-ui
60:08 - uh is it oh okay I see I see okay and
60:14 - and slash
60:15 - call and I think now we should be good
60:19 - and it's installing right rolled back
60:22 - failed
60:23 - op okay now it's what's
60:26 - up seems like it's okay mhm okay so it's
60:30 - installing nice nice awesome awesome so
60:33 - let's see if somebody dropped a question
60:35 - that's worth answering somebody asks
60:39 - what is the extension name
60:41 - again so it's called es7 react Redux
60:45 - graph QA Snippets but if you start
60:48 - typing in es7 Snippets and maybe put
60:52 - react uh it will give you give it it to
60:54 - you uh as the first one
61:00 - right okay so that's that's like a super
61:02 - powerful tool it saves you crazy amount
61:06 - of time actually uh and you want to go
61:09 - with uh saving time okay now we got that
61:13 - installed but we also need to install um
61:16 - material UI icons so I'm just going to
61:19 - go ahead and use the exact same uh
61:22 - command and just delete call from the
61:24 - end and type in icons
61:29 - instead so we are getting that as
61:34 - well yeah material UI icons is one of
61:36 - the most popular icons right now right
61:38 - in the it's a it's a very powerful um
61:42 - what's it called CSS Library exactly
61:46 - exactly exactly it's super powerful and
61:49 - it takes you after to the next level
61:51 - actually yeah you can pretty much find
61:53 - everything there it's awesome exactly I
61:56 - also heard that bootstrap stopped using
61:57 - material
61:59 - UI oh yeah so they have their own icons
62:01 - now right going on yeah exactly I mean
62:04 - it's so much better than than bootstrap
62:07 - right okay uh now with that
62:10 - done what we want to do is we kind of
62:14 - want to have like a
62:16 - logo um oh and we also be using BM
62:20 - naming convention so if you don't know
62:22 - what that is I highly recommend going
62:24 - going ahead and uh Googling it
62:27 - up uh but we will be using uh the BM
62:30 - naming convention and inside of the
62:32 - first div we will just name it um we
62:36 - will name it header right so that's part
62:39 - of the b b naming convention okay next
62:43 - up we kind of want to
62:45 - have uh a a logo and we want to have
62:50 - another div which will contain this logo
62:53 - right so I'm just going going to I have

62:58 - a new div and I've searched up the
63:01 - Wikipedia uh Facebook
63:04 - logo add in an ALT text of Facebook logo
63:08 - and I should be able to see it uh on the
63:12 - app which is not running at the moment
63:14 - so I'm just going to go ahead and type
63:15 - in mpm start and it will fire up uh
63:19 - on uh on Frankie's
63:22 - screen um with that done let's actually
63:25 - go ahead and import that into our app.js
63:29 - file right so I'm just going to go and
63:32 - start typing in
63:34 - header and it
63:37 - will it will or will not show up okay so
63:41 - it's not showing up at the moment so I
63:43 - have to import it manually so I'm going
63:45 - to go ahead and type in up top import

72:57 - buttons and that will make the whole
72:59 - thing like have like a nice little
73:01 - squiggle or like this uh nice effect so
73:05 - if you go ahead and like try clicking
73:07 - those icons on the right hand side that
73:09 - would be awesome to like show off uh how
73:12 - it actually looks like so let me
73:14 - actually it
73:17 - up see oh damn so I'm sharing it on my
73:21 - other screen I just want you guys to see
73:23 - it
73:24 - you can like make the
73:28 - um make the top smaller uh okay yeah so
73:32 - now if we click these right it's what
73:35 - David is talking about yeah exactly
73:38 - behavor super
73:39 - dope okay so I think with that done we
73:44 - are done with heather. JS for
73:49 - now uh what we want to do is we want to
73:52 - actually style
73:54 - this so let's go and actually import up
73:58 - top the uh header the uh CSS file
74:05 - nice uh and with that let's actually go
74:08 - into header at
74:10 - CSS and nice so we will be we will be uh
74:16 - adding like a couple of styling
74:20 - stuff so first thing first uh the whole
74:23 - header needs to have display Flex
74:27 - right
74:30 - um something
74:32 - is header CSS cannot found header
74:39 - CSS oh I think I I think I know what I
74:42 - uh where I made a mistake I need to add
74:45 - this uh at the actual bath okay
74:49 - nice um so we we adding this display
74:53 - Flex We will be adding uh 15 pixels top
74:57 - and bottom and we are adding 20 pixels
75:01 - right and left hand side padding uh for
75:04 - the whole uh thing we will be using
75:07 - justify content space between to
75:09 - actually space uh things nicely out uh
75:13 - we are making the header stick to the uh
75:16 - stick to the top so we are using
75:18 - position
75:19 - sticky uh we are setting the background
75:23 - color to white the Zen index is going to
75:26 - be 100 top is going to be zero because
75:29 - we actually want this to snap to the uh
75:32 - top and we actually want to uh give it
75:36 - like a nice little box Shadow this will
75:38 - all make sense when we uh style
75:40 - everything out okay so let's actually
75:43 - get that Facebook logo in order so we
75:47 - will need to have two uh two more
75:51 - styling stuff so up
75:54 - here uh we have the header left which is
75:57 - going to be display Flex right uh we
76:00 - have the justify content which is spaced
76:03 - evenly and right uh when I added the he
76:07 - of uh head for the image the logo uh to
76:11 - 40 pixels it actually all rendered out
76:15 - uh the way I want it to look like so as
76:18 - you can see it's currently it is display
76:20 - Flex
76:22 - right
76:24 - awesome um do we got any questions
76:27 - Frankie or are we good to go see
76:33 - Umar kusum Mani asks hey clever
76:36 - programmer can I make content for you
76:38 - guys yes my friend right now we're
76:40 - looking for developers that can actually
76:44 - you know speak in front of camera show
76:46 - other people how to you know build their
76:48 - skills as programmers if you guys are
76:50 - that person whether you know JavaScript
76:52 - maybe even in Python you know reach out
76:54 - to cazi at on Instagram and we'll be in
76:59 - touch you know review whether your
77:01 - skills are are good if you're a good fit
77:03 - for you know the company or everything
77:05 - but if you guys are interested in
77:06 - creating content for us you know we are
77:08 - currently looking for developers right
77:10 - David yeah that's right that's
77:13 - right okay with that said actually let's
77:17 - go and style the input awesome so we
77:20 - will be uh adding like a header input uh
77:25 - which is like we want the whole thing to
77:27 - be like Flex right so as you can see on
77:30 - the right hand side uh everything
77:34 - is so the whole
77:38 - um display uh or whole input uh got
77:42 - aligned into a row yeah and we want the
77:46 - items to be aligned in the center that's
77:48 - why it's like in the uh middle uh we
77:51 - want to set the background color to this
77:54 - E2 F5 uh nice little color thing
77:59 - because that's actually the exact same
78:01 - color that Facebook uses uh for their uh
78:04 - input fields we also want like a 10
78:07 - pixel of padding uh margin on the left
78:10 - as well and the Border radius of 33
78:14 - pixels now we also want that uh ugly
78:18 - looking input field to like kind of like
78:21 - be transparent
78:24 - and we will be just adding like a header
78:27 - input uh and like actually notice that
78:30 - I'm in um I'm targeting the input inside
78:34 - of header input right so I set the
78:36 - bordered none background color to
78:38 - transparent and the outline width to
78:42 - zero nice uh next up we have the header
78:46 - Center which we actually want to have
78:50 - display Flex again and we wrote Flex one
78:55 - here because we want the uh the header
78:58 - Center to take use as much space as it
79:01 - needs as possible and we just want
79:05 - everything to be uh in the center okay
79:10 - nice and if we go back to header. JS now
79:15 - um here is something I want to call your
79:18 - uh attention to so we are adding header
79:21 - options inside of header center right
79:24 - and that's what we are going to be
79:25 - targeting right now so for header
79:28 - options of course we want to have
79:31 - display flx we want to have them aligned
79:34 - to the center we want to uh add zero
79:37 - padding uh top and bottom I actually
79:41 - added a little bit of cheat sheet over
79:43 - here uh Frankie can you scroll up a bit
79:46 - uh in the CSS
79:49 - file nice so so the comment in here here
79:53 - is actually a bit of a cheat sheet um oh
79:57 - I think I lost the connection to the
79:59 - editor
80:01 - again to live sh yeah uh that's weird I
80:06 - still see you
80:07 - here can you actually follow
80:11 - me no you're not following me because
80:13 - I'm clicking around I see let me see try
80:17 - again yeah I think I see
80:20 - you are you in Justified
80:23 - content um nope I'm actually not in the
80:26 - file now it says uh the host seems to be
80:30 - offline again that's weird we kept
80:33 - getting that connection problem so
80:36 - should we do the same thing that I just
80:38 - did yeah yeah let's actually restart the
80:40 - whole vs code on your end and won't take
80:43 - long so let's just command Q out of X
80:46 - code I mean sorry Visual Studio code
80:48 - then open it up
80:50 - again waiting for it to load awesome
80:54 - what we're going to do now is invite
80:55 - David again seems like we're losing
80:58 - connection yeah seems like we need to do
81:00 - it a couple of times so start
81:03 - collaboration session
81:05 - done sign in with
81:07 - GitHub let's get
81:12 - it currently signing in with GitHub once
81:16 - again let's see so I'm just doing this
81:20 - on my other screen guys so you guys
81:21 - don't have to you know go through the
81:22 - whole process
81:25 - again yeah like I mean live share was
81:28 - such an awesome tool and then it started
81:31 - to have all these bugs I think it's
81:33 - actually a bug on their side yeah I I we
81:36 - had this issue with the sunny last time
81:40 - uh for some reason L the okay got the
81:45 - new got the new link nice open it
81:51 - up
81:57 - okay so I'm joining at the moment as we
82:01 - speak I see you're
82:03 - here okay nice um it says you left
82:07 - though once
82:11 - again it says
82:14 - joining now you joined again okay nice
82:18 - awesome awesome yeah I see all the files
82:21 - now okay perfect
82:23 - okay uh can you follow
82:26 - me Target is not currently editing a
82:28 - shared
82:30 - document uh that's not
82:35 - true okay um let's try that I go into
82:38 - header.
82:40 - JS still I'm in header. CSS now there we
82:45 - go so I think okay sure now I'm
82:47 - following you yep now I'm following you
82:50 - okay nice okay so what I what I left off
82:53 - is that I left a little bit of cheat
82:55 - sheet over here so if you add these two
82:58 - properties into petting it will mean
83:00 - that the first number is going to be uh
83:03 - for top and bottom and the second one is
83:05 - going to be for left and right and we
83:07 - are going to be using that again with
83:10 - the header
83:11 - options so uh I'm just going to pop it
83:14 - in so header option we have a display
83:16 - Flex uh we will be aligning them into
83:19 - the center um we are adding padding like
83:22 - no padding up top and down below and we
83:26 - will have 30 pixels of padding like uh
83:29 - in between them and whenever we hover
83:32 - them hover over them we want the cursor
83:34 - to be a
83:35 - pointer okay next up let's actually make
83:39 - it look super nice whenever we hover
83:42 - over them so uh whenever you hover over
83:46 - like actually we need to add like a
83:49 - colon here uh with a hover Word file
83:52 - following so first up we got uh we want
83:55 - to set the background color to the
83:58 - Facebook
83:59 - Gray uh I'm just going to call it
84:01 - Facebook Gray from now on uh we want to
84:03 - set the Border radius to 10 pixels uh
84:07 - align them Center of course um with the
84:11 - same padding and we want to
84:14 - disable uh B border and buttom right and
84:18 - one thing that we want to do as well is
84:23 - to set nicely and blue uh set those apps
84:29 - to completely blue oh I think uh I think
84:32 - we need to fire up the application again
84:35 - because it's not updating can you give
84:37 - me yeah
84:39 - perfect okay so I'm typing in mpm start
84:43 - yeah it goes ahead and does
84:46 - oh um sear file
84:50 - directory oh I see see okay yeah I I
84:53 - know what happens so I wasn't in the
84:56 - correct
84:59 - folder yeah B and
85:02 - PM uh start
85:05 - nice so now we should be able to see it
85:10 - updating on the right hand side as I do
85:15 - decoding so let's wait a little while it
85:19 - starts the development
85:20 - server and
85:24 - so it's loading up the page again right
85:26 - what's up it's loading up the page again
85:29 - yeah yeah ah yeah that's the one uh can
85:32 - you full screen it yes so what we just
85:35 - done is uh those Center icons right so
85:39 - you can see that uh the one that we
85:42 - actually uh made active is now uh the
85:46 - Facebook blue because uh I'll be
85:48 - explaining it a little
85:50 - bit and we also also have those uh hover
85:54 - over effects right so it can just hover
85:56 - over uh one of the icons nice so that
86:00 - that's the other thing we did two things
86:02 - right it's it's the it's two things on
86:04 - the hover over it's one it makes the
86:06 - mouse a pointer and two exactly it makes
86:09 - the background gray so you know you want
86:12 - to make design very much intuitive
86:15 - because sometimes you know you add icons
86:17 - but you don't add the hover effects like
86:19 - this and it doesn't give directions to
86:20 - your user to let them know that you can
86:22 - actually click on these icons exactly
86:26 - that's right that's right okay let's go
86:29 - back to the
86:30 - code so down here I've actually added
86:34 - this uh mui SG icon D root and that is
86:40 - actually a class name which is
86:43 - automatically added to all the uh icons
86:47 - inside of material UI so if you don't
86:49 - know what this is this is basically
86:51 - targeting thing all the um material UI
86:56 - icons inside of the header option active
87:01 - class right that's all you need to that
87:04 - that's how you need to translate it for
87:06 - yourself okay we also want to add uh to
87:11 - the active icon some nice little uh
87:15 - border button so it will actually show
87:19 - that this is the active stuff uh can you
87:22 - full screen the uh current build yes
87:28 - go nice so you can actually now see if I
87:32 - go ahead and remove that for a bit um it
87:37 - just it just disappeared that little uh
87:40 - blue line right on the
87:44 - home yeah now it should be there very
87:49 - soon
87:51 - um so let's refresh the app so see it I
87:55 - couldn't save it actually
88:00 - okay oh
88:03 - damn uh you can remove the uh command oh
88:08 - connection is lost again from live share
88:12 - mhm what is happening with live share
88:13 - today man it's crazy I don't know I have
88:17 - no clue dude let see I'm going to invite
88:19 - you again here's the link I'm not get to
88:22 - x out of it this time though
88:30 - okay
88:31 - okay it says you you seem to be offline
88:34 - again okay so when that what is going on
88:37 - yeah when that happens what I have to do
88:39 - then is just cancel find Visual Studio
88:42 - code this this has been working so let's
88:45 - continue doing
88:46 - it and save you guys a little bit of
88:49 - time and then start collaboration set
88:52 - session there we
88:53 - go and here should be the next link
88:58 - David you go
89:01 - bro okay let's try it
89:07 - out okay nice it's loading okay hey

89:15 - like five times
89:18 - yeah oh cool I just saw you join let me
89:22 - see let me actually follow you okay nice
89:26 - okay so I'm just removing command from

90:02 - yeah
90:03 - so oh my God the other one just
90:07 - died we got so many sessions
90:13 - open
90:16 - okay so with
90:20 - that okay nice so I've just added two
90:23 - more
90:24 - um two more properties here one of them
90:28 - is going to uh trigger all these
90:32 - um all these material UI icons and make
90:36 - them gray all the other ones right yeah
90:39 - so the active is going to be blue and
90:41 - all the other ones are going to be gray
90:43 - uh gray and we actually want them to
90:46 - turn blue whenever you hover over them
90:49 - so if you can go ahead and demo that
90:51 - that would be awesome awesome so let's
90:53 - actually make this full screen so you
90:54 - guys can check it out should I reload it

92:36 - you can see they turn blue that's it
92:38 - right that's the that's the thing we
92:40 - wanted to uh see okay uh let's go and

98:50 - you okay so I'm here now I'm in the
98:52 - folder
98:54 - right yeah yeah yeah okay um let's go
98:59 - ahead and create a new file called
99:03 - sidebar. JS uh with a capital S inside
99:06 - of source
99:09 - and uh inside source and components so
99:12 - let's click components components uh
99:15 - it's it's right yeah okay so that's
99:16 - where you want to go ahead and create a
99:18 - new
99:20 - file yeah and that's going to be uh
99:22 - sideb the JS with a capital S at the
99:24 - front uh no no no uh like the Side Bar
99:30 - yeah yeah uh just simple J yep perfect
99:34 - and what I want you to do uh paste in
99:37 - there is going to be a snip
99:42 - it
99:48 - um okay I just uh sent you the snippet
99:51 - on

99:55 - what so let's go ahead copy everything
99:58 - from there and just uh Chuck it in there
100:02 - nice so what this is so up top we are
100:06 - actually importing all Lads of kind of
100:09 - emojis and um and all those icons that
100:14 - uh we are going to be using inside of
100:18 - the um inside of the component and then
100:23 - we are actually creating the component
100:26 - so actually there is a line that we do
100:29 - not need so con user dispatch uh line 15
100:34 - you can delete that we will be adding
100:36 - that later on okay
100:40 - um
100:42 - so uh and we also okay so it's going to
100:46 - freak out because uh the sidebar row is
100:49 - not actually created

100:53 - so uh the first cbar row
100:58 - has uh user photo URL we don't need

102:21 - help other beginner people you know
102:24 - other beginner developers answer the
102:25 - questions and Joel green says at Daniel
102:28 - capitalize your document names it's how
102:30 - react can know it's a file and can be
102:33 - used as a JS tag exactly exactly that's
102:37 - why I had to capitalize the s in the
102:38 - sidebar. JS file that's
102:44 - right were you able to jump in was it
102:47 - loading uh it is actually loading as we
102:50 - speak Peak awesome that's cool I've just
102:52 - sent you the new snippet uh let's
102:54 - actually change everything to that cool
102:56 - let's see what the new snippet is got it
103:00 - okay nice and just uh delete everything
103:02 - and and chck that in okay so I'm going

110:27 - currently we haven't built just yet um
110:30 - but we will be do it very soon so the

111:11 - component
111:14 - nice see okay set by row that's the
111:16 - component
111:18 - jsjs okay so open up in the
111:22 - files .js here we go boom yeah and just

111:30 - importing Avatar and we are importing
111:33 - the Side Bar the JS file um and inside
111:37 - and there is like we're destructuring
111:40 - everything that we are passing through
111:42 - inside to this component
111:46 - right um and then we are uh creating a
111:50 - div uh which will have the Avatar and
111:54 - which will
111:56 - receive uh a source and if we have an
112:00 - icon we are uh dropping in the icon
112:05 - which is also popped into uh as a
112:09 - dependency to the uh component okay so
112:13 - with that said actually if you could go
112:15 - ahead and uh start running the server

127:13 - dependencies which would have taken
127:15 - crazy amount of time if you zip them
127:19 - so while
127:20 - you're uh loading up your vs code to
127:25 - share it I'll just go ahead and um set
127:30 - everything

132:59 - okay okay I have it have everything
133:02 - zoomed okay guys so uh I'm just in
133:05 - before uh the things went crazy before
133:09 - creating the sidebar so I'm just going
133:10 - to go ahead and do the sidebar thing
133:12 - again so I'm creating a sidebar. JS I'm
133:16 - doing the RFC who
133:18 - I'm I'm doing the
133:20 - RFC rafc stuff uh that we have already
133:27 - done
133:29 - um and I'm going to be creating so I'm
133:32 - going to be importing a bunch of stuff
133:35 - uh which are essentially all the
133:38 - material UI icons that we are using
133:41 - throughout this
133:44 - um this very um what you call it
133:47 - component right and down here I'm
133:51 - actually adding a class name of
133:56 - uh of
133:58 - sidebar and that's what we uh we will
134:01 - have here okay and I'm also adding a
134:05 - couple of uh sidebar uh elements uh
134:08 - hopefully this time we will uh we will
134:11 - have everything uh
134:14 - working uh and the title is going to be
134:16 - Frankie
134:18 - nice and we also need to import the CSS
134:22 - file which I haven't created just
134:28 - yet and let's do it right now and we
134:31 - also need yeah uh so we have the side
134:35 - barow so I'm actually dividing it up a
134:38 - bit so guys you can actually go ahead
134:41 - and copy this uh code so what I'm doing
134:44 - here I'm importing react with the normal
134:46 - rafc uh type of stuff I'm importing the
134:50 - sidebar row component which is not
134:52 - defined yet but we will get there in a
134:54 - bit uh I'm importing all these icons
134:57 - which are going to be used in here and
134:59 - essentially these are going to be on the
135:01 - left hand side uh where uh all the
135:05 - sidebar is going to sidebar stuff is
135:06 - going to happen uh we have all this text
135:10 - in there that we want uh want it to
135:13 - display I'm removing all these lines and
135:16 - the first line essentially is going to
135:18 - be the one that will have a icon uh
135:23 - which
135:24 - will show the logged in person's uh face
135:29 - and the name but we are actually mocking
135:32 - these out with uh with a couple of um
135:37 - data So currently it should be sunny
135:40 - Sunny's face and Frankie's name which is
135:43 - kind of crazy but that's what I had on
135:44 - my
135:46 - clipboard okay let's go ahead ahead and
135:48 - create the side whoops uh let's go ahead
135:50 - and create the side uh bar. CSS file
135:54 - which we are already importing and we
135:57 - have already
135:59 - um have it okay nice so we are actually
136:02 - adding a padding uh up top and down
136:05 - below at 25 pixels and 10 pixels to the
136:08 - right and the left and we are also
136:11 - adding a
136:12 - flux uh of 33 nice so with that done I'm
136:18 - just going to go ahead and uh close that
136:20 - and let's see if actually it this thing
136:23 - loads up but this doesn't load up
136:25 - because I haven't imported it into
136:27 - app.js so now is the time to go ahead
136:29 - create a new row and go ahead and type
136:32 - your uh sidebar and if you can oh
136:36 - damn uh sidebar so I want you to see it
136:40 - on the right hand side that it is saying
136:43 - Auto Import so it's actually importing
136:46 - it right right here so you need to add
136:49 - that line if it doesn't import it for
136:51 - you but because it did for me uh I don't
136:54 - have to worry about that can you
136:55 - actually zoom in a little bit more on
136:56 - the code David oh yeah sure uh is it
137:00 - cool okay nice
137:03 - um something is going yeah uh because I
137:07 - don't have the sidebar uh row file ready
137:10 - just yet but I'm just going to go ahead
137:13 - and create that so sidebar row. Js nice
137:19 - uh I'm just going to go RFC
137:23 - perfect so with that done this is how
137:26 - the application looks like right now why
137:29 - it's not showing anything uh good good
137:32 - question because we are importing this
137:34 - stuff uh which doesn't actually have any
137:38 - single thing uh inside of uh there right
137:41 - so if you go ahead like sidebar o
137:44 - doesn't actually do anything so actually
137:48 - what I'm going to be doing
137:50 - is I will be adding all this stuff so we
137:54 - are actually capturing the source which
137:56 - will be the link uh for the Avatar right
138:00 - so you can see it right here I'm uh I'm
138:03 - also passing in an icon and a title uh
138:07 - which will be used for the actual
138:13 - um the actual uh yeah so this is what h
138:17 - what is happening at the moment right
138:20 - and actually one thing that we forgot
138:23 - with the um C no no no with with the
138:27 - cleanup process at the very beginning
138:29 - which is my mistake uh is cleaning up
138:32 - app.css so we just go ahead and delete
138:35 - everything from app. CSS I'm sorry guys
138:38 - uh this is being a rough day and we also
138:42 - need to add a star uh which is margin
138:47 - zero uh to the index. CSS okay now uh we
138:53 - should be good to go yeah so now
138:56 - everything is getting uh in order uh we
139:00 - got Sunny's face we got Frankie we got
139:02 - all these uh logos so it's getting good
139:07 - actually believe it or not we are going
139:09 - to be on track do we got any show the
139:12 - app on the side of the
139:14 - code um yeah I can do then
139:18 - boom okay
139:20 - nice uh and I will actually make it a
139:24 - little bit smaller and then I can so I
139:27 - can okay so is the code easily readable
139:30 - yes nice okay uh so we have the
139:34 - application on the right hand side I
139:35 - will just make it bigger once we are uh
139:38 - once I'm showing something and otherwise
139:40 - it will be like this small okay so now I
139:43 - will be actually going ahead and
139:45 - creating the
139:48 - uh
139:50 - sidebar row. CSS
139:53 - file uh and closing that
139:57 - thing and I'm actually importing it
140:00 - because we're going to be using that for
140:02 - the
140:03 - styling and for the sidebar row uh we
140:07 - have a couple of stuff going on so
140:09 - notice that uh on the right hand side uh
140:13 - we actually had these things done
140:17 - right so what essentially
140:21 - happens is that we added a display Flex
140:25 - to the whole thing so every single row
140:27 - will be uh flexibly displayed that means
140:31 - it will be passed into a one row
140:33 - everything is going to be aligned to
140:34 - Center ping is going to be 10 10 pixels
140:36 - cursor pointer uh Side by row hover so
140:40 - whenever I hover over them you see this
140:42 - is the animation that that you got
140:45 - right and so that's the light gray
140:50 - background and the Border radius of Thum
140:52 - pixels so notice it's not not too huge
140:55 - but you can actually see uh that there
140:58 - is a border radius
141:01 - right so
141:04 - that's H that's crazy
141:08 - okay um nice and we also added uh every
141:13 - single row like 20 pixels margin left
141:16 - and the font weight of 00 nice and we
141:19 - also targeted all the uh material UI
141:23 - icons right so remember all these uh all
141:28 - these little icons have a have this uh
141:31 - class name where and we targeted them to
141:34 - be extra large and we added them the
141:37 - Facebook blue color nice with that done
141:41 - uh we can say that we are done with the
141:44 - Side Bar hey that serves an air
141:50 - horn air horn on the
141:53 - time nice okay uh let's actually go
141:57 - ahead and start covering up the
142:00 - feed so what are we going to be doing
142:03 - the with the feed uh we actually have
142:06 - the H whoa there is some party going on
142:09 - in here so the feed is going to be this
142:12 - part uh where we have all these stories
142:16 - we have
142:17 - um we actually have couple more
142:20 - components this is one
142:23 - uh uh big uh big component which will
142:27 - have a couple more components right we
142:31 - also have this as the message sender
142:34 - component and we also have this huge po
142:38 - which will have a couple more smaller
142:40 - components so I hope this visual
142:42 - breakdown helped a lot for you
142:45 - guys and actually this is what we are
142:48 - going to be working with uh right now so
142:52 - I'm just going to go back to my local
142:54 - one and let's actually go ahead and
142:58 - create uh the necessary stuff so we will
143:02 - have a feed. JS
143:05 - file which
143:08 - will which will have a couple of stuff
143:10 - inside of it okay so let's start up with
143:14 - an
143:16 - rafc
143:19 - awesome and we will be importing a
143:22 - couple of stuff but let's just not uh
143:25 - worry about those for
143:27 - now um what we will have
143:31 - is basically
143:35 - um boom so we will have we will give a
143:39 - class name of
143:41 - feed
143:43 - um right here we will be uh importing
143:46 - the story real uh which is actually uh
143:51 - this
143:52 - part all right so that whole
143:54 - thing uh which will like have more stuff
143:58 - we will have the message sender which is
144:01 - this
144:02 - part and this is something that we will
144:05 - be do later on all right so uh let's
144:11 - actually add a bog
144:14 - post instead of this and we will be
144:18 - using it later on when we have the back
144:20 - end ready right so so let's actually
144:24 - create the story real first and the
144:26 - message sender
144:27 - first um so let's create a story real.
144:33 - JS file and
144:36 - the uh message sender. JS file
144:42 - nice um so I'm going to be
144:45 - adding
144:48 - this is not going to be used yeah okay
144:51 - perfect so now we have a not crashing
144:54 - application that's a good uh good sign
144:59 - um store
145:01 - real what's up that's always a good
145:04 - sign yeah exactly I love the story today
145:08 - right I love the story real components
145:10 - because they make it so that it's not
145:12 - just you know a blank kind of like an
145:15 - input bar and you like you know it seems
145:18 - it adds so much layout to it it adds
145:20 - like almost Dimension to it other like
145:23 - otherwise it would look a little bit Tod
145:25 - in my opinion so it's good
145:28 - experience yeah so I actually got these
145:30 - crazy images from the internet I just uh
145:33 - typed in obstruct portrait I think and
145:38 - got all these uh all this stuff okay so
145:42 - what we will be having inside of here is
145:44 - basically a
145:47 - class name which will be story real
145:51 - right because we somehow we need to uh
145:53 - Target all this stuff and we will
145:55 - actually adding more uh components
145:59 - inside of here right so we want to have
146:01 - like a story which has a couple of stuff
146:04 - like an image a profile pick whoops
146:09 - profile pick and a name which will be a
146:14 - title this
146:15 - time so this is what we want to have now
146:25 - um okay
146:29 - so perfect uh what we want to have is
146:33 - create a new file which will be story.
146:38 - JS we got a tons of components this time
146:42 - guys this is
146:43 - crazy okay so the story is basically
146:47 - importing the Avatar right because
146:50 - that's what we will be using for the
146:53 - person's Avatar Photo on the story we're
146:56 - going to have the H1 that's going to be
146:58 - the title which is going to be the name
147:01 - and this is where we are putting the
147:05 - um stories so sorry the person's profile
147:09 - Source
147:11 - right okay
147:15 - um and we ALS o want to have like a
147:18 - background image uh for the whole uh div
147:22 - which will be the image URL which we are
147:25 - passing in from the story rail right and
147:28 - we are currently notice that we are
147:30 - using inline
147:32 - styling which is literally like adding a
147:35 - style to the div which we uh and we're
147:38 - adding the background image which is
147:40 - going to be have a URL and we are
147:43 - passing in the actual URL into that uh
147:48 - styling right and the class name is
147:50 - going to be story so that we can style
147:52 - the whole thing nicely now let's
147:55 - actually uh go ahead
147:59 - and import and make it look nice but
148:04 - first um let's actually
148:08 - import is the background image the the
148:10 - art pictures that you got exactly
148:13 - exactly exactly so I went back to app.js
148:17 - so that we can actually check this thing
148:19 - out later on when it works not now of
148:23 - course uh but notice that I've imported
148:26 - it again with Auto Import
148:29 - okay all right
148:31 - um so inside a
148:34 - feed so message sender is not def
148:38 - yeah uh what happened is
148:41 - that story real wasn't important as well
148:47 - as uh message sender
148:58 - either yeah so I'm Auto importing
149:01 - everything you need to have these two
149:03 - lines of code to in order to make this
149:06 - app working nice so now we have it so
149:11 - store real uh we basically want to go
149:14 - ahead and import a story right it's
149:18 - again it's going to be Auto
149:20 - importing and we will be passing in a
149:23 - couple of stuff that we just had in here
149:26 - right so image profile source and title
149:30 - those are the stuff that we want to uh
149:33 - import inside of there um and I actually
149:37 - have these uh
149:40 - ready um story
149:44 - real so
149:48 - uh we will be adding those like this so
149:52 - we're adding the image which is going to
149:54 - be um story.
149:59 - CSS um because I haven't created it just
150:02 - yet so this is currently how our story
150:05 - looks like kind of ugly
150:09 - MH uh but yeah and I'm adding two
150:13 - more and you can literally like pass in
150:16 - whatever kind of image you want in here
150:19 - and whatever profile Source you want in
150:21 - here and the name again doesn't really
150:23 - matter as long as you're passing in
150:26 - these three uh properties right so and
150:31 - so the story is just going to go ahead
150:33 - and render everything everything out
150:35 - nicely uh on the right hand side
150:39 - okay so let's actually go ahead and
150:42 - create this story so create all the uh
150:46 - CSS files that we will be uh needing so
150:49 - we will need a message sender. CSS we
150:54 - will need a story. CSS um story real
151:01 - CSS and I think everything has a CSS and
151:04 - ajs pair
151:09 - nice so
151:14 - um so the story real but CSS is
151:17 - basically not going to be uh super
151:20 - complicated we just want it to be
151:23 - display flex but in order for to make it
151:26 - actually work uh we need
151:29 - to we need to actually go ahead and
151:32 - Import in right import
151:35 - um story real. CSS
151:39 - right so now we have everything in one
151:43 - row nice that is perfect
151:47 - yeah
151:51 - exactly uh okay with that done um let's
151:56 - actually go to the story. CSS file and
152:01 - let's make the story look super nice so
152:04 - what we want to have is basically uh add
152:08 - a position
152:10 - relative uh we want to like Center the
152:13 - background like this we want to go ahead
152:17 - and and like have the image uh cover the
152:21 - whole background
152:23 - right uh so that's going to be
152:24 - background size because remember we
152:28 - actually
152:30 - uh added it as an inline styling so the
152:34 - background image is going to be the
152:35 - image we pass in right so the uh it
152:40 - needs to cover it doesn't repeat we want
152:43 - to make sure that it only shows up once
152:45 - the width is going to be 120 pixels head
152:49 - is going to be 200 pixels uh we are
152:51 - adding a nice little box shadow of uh
152:55 - with these uh properties and we are
152:59 - actually adding a border radius of temp
153:04 - pixels um with a margin right of 10
153:07 - pixels as well cursor pointer uh cursor
153:11 - needs to be a pointer right so when I
153:14 - hover over uh you you can see it turns
153:17 - to a
153:18 - pointer
153:21 - right okay and we also want like a nice
153:25 - little transition yeah which we will be
153:28 - adding just now so if I go ahead and
153:31 - hover over it uh it should be scaling
153:35 - right beautiful yeah you can even see
153:37 - the Shadows under it so the Shadows
153:39 - actually make those images pop up a
153:41 - little bit more they're very subtle but
153:43 - if you see under the images you can see
153:45 - a little bit of Gray gray right there's
153:47 - a little bit of gray gives a dimension
153:49 - makes it seem like they're pop out plus
153:51 - the animation is called ease in and so
153:55 - that's that's what you're seeing right
153:57 - now okay so this is how we created all
154:01 - these stories
154:03 - nice we also want to Target the story
154:07 - Avatar uh and add the margin of 10
154:10 - pixels and the border of five pixels we
154:13 - want to make it uh we want to make it
154:15 - like really look like like Facebook is
154:17 - so notice that there is uh that nice
154:21 - little uh
154:23 - border we also added a little bit of uh
154:28 - margin here and
154:30 - here and we also made the Border look
154:34 - the Facebook blue and it's actually
154:37 - right uh like true here H as well
154:41 - as it's true over
154:44 - here nice
154:47 - and we also want to uh position the text
154:52 - nicely so we we add the position
154:56 - absolute uh the bottom is going to be
154:59 - like we want it uh 20 pixels from the
155:02 - bottom we want uh 20 pixels from the
155:05 - left hand side and we add a white color
155:09 - to
155:10 - it just like this right
155:14 - so this is the uh left 20 pixels this is
155:18 - bottom 20 pixels looks white and yeah
155:23 - that's pretty much uh setting up the
155:26 - individual stories that's setting up the
155:29 - names right on those on those covers
155:32 - yeah and and actually the story is is
155:34 - this we now we need to uh move the story
155:38 - real up there uh it's going to be
155:41 - happening very soon
155:44 - awesome okay
155:47 - um so to actually put the story reel
155:50 - next to uh the sidebar what we need to
155:54 - do is go into app.css
155:57 - whoops we need to go into app.css and we
156:02 - actually want to make the background
156:04 - like this uh this Facebook is white
156:08 - oops and we want to have we want to add
156:12 - the app. body to have a display
156:16 - Flex which is for some reason doesn't
156:19 - seem to be uh nicely loading but we will
156:22 - get there very
156:25 - soon okay
156:28 - um nice
156:31 - perfect okay that's CSS uh we now want
156:35 - to go ahead
156:37 - into
156:43 - um
156:44 - yep so we are kind of done with uh these
156:49 - stories let's actually figure out why
156:53 - these are not uh going next to
156:57 - the
156:58 - um right
157:14 - there
157:17 - okay we will we we will figure it out uh
157:20 - in just a bit let's actually go and go
157:24 - ahead and create the message
157:26 - sender um so the message sender is going
157:30 - to be where you make the posts pretty
157:32 - much right on the Facebook exactly yeah
157:35 - that's right so the message sender is
157:38 - going to be this part we will be working
157:41 - on this part right
157:44 - now
157:46 - okay
157:47 - [Music]
157:52 - um so the we are actually in the message
157:56 - sender uh. JS right
158:00 - now and kind of like what we want to do
158:04 - is uh just let's just first uh make it
158:07 - look nice so we pretty much
158:11 - have uh we want to add the class naming
158:18 - which is going to be uh message sender
158:22 - of
158:23 - course
158:24 - um we want so it is it's actually
158:28 - divided to two parts there is a top and
158:31 - a bottom as you can see on the right
158:33 - hand side uh I'll be zooming in a bit
158:37 - somebody in the comments says is says or
158:41 - is mail says app.js add class name appor

159:05 - the actual dirt that you forget to you
159:07 - know have a bigger vision of what's
159:09 - going on it's it's very
159:12 - natural oh hold
159:14 - on
159:16 - okay
159:17 - something oh because I've add added the
159:19 - header inside
159:21 - there okay there we go there we go I
159:24 - just fix it awesome man okay so what I
159:27 - did uh and thank you so much for the
159:29 - comment so I added this uh class name
159:32 - the app. body and I just wrapped the
159:36 - sideb and the feed and later on the
159:38 - widgets that are going to come here as
159:39 - well inside of here and what you need to
159:42 - uh make sure is that the header is
159:45 - outside right so as you can see it's not
159:48 - in the app. body
159:52 - okay um let's actually go back to the
159:55 - message sender. JS nice so what we will
160:00 - have we will have a message sender uh
160:04 - top and that will contain an
160:09 - avatar oh I'm going to hide the left
160:12 - side so we will have an avatar which
160:16 - will have a source uh I'm just going to
160:19 - pop
160:22 - in
160:23 - um the usual Sunny
160:28 - image yeah
160:30 - and yeah it's right there uh you can
160:33 - already see it it's right there
160:37 - nice and we also want to have a
160:42 - form uh which
160:44 - will pretty much contain an input
160:49 - actually uh two inputs one of them is
160:52 - going to be a text and the other one is
160:55 - going to be for a file so we will
160:57 - literally go ahead and we will be
161:01 - uploading files to mongod DB right so so
161:06 - the input so the text input is going to
161:09 - be a type of
161:11 - text
161:13 - um we will have a place holder with them
161:16 - what's on your mind and on change we
161:19 - will be triggering off the E uh we will
161:23 - be setting the input so we want to save
161:26 - the input so we need to introduce a UST
161:29 - State
161:30 - hook right and that's something we
161:33 - haven't imported
161:35 - yet so we need to import them of course
161:38 - and that is kind of and that is actually
161:40 - a way of um saving like like adding
161:46 - variables to react so we will have a
161:49 - const
161:50 - input
161:52 - um and set input and we will be using it
161:57 - as a use
161:59 - State uh and initially this will be
162:04 - completely empty right so inside of here
162:08 - uh the input field is going to be a type
162:10 - of text we'll have the class name uh
162:13 - we'll have the placeholder what's in
162:15 - your mind
162:15 - the value is going to be from this state
162:19 - and whenever we hit a button we want to
162:23 - have
162:25 - uh we want to uh set the input to this
162:30 - uh thing right so whatever we press we
162:33 - want to save it inside of input yo
162:36 - what's up yeah I was just saying that
162:38 - it's it's taring targeting the value
162:40 - that you're inputting right exactly
162:43 - exactly that's right that's right
162:46 - so next up what we want to
162:49 - do
162:53 - is import uh the input as well so it's
162:57 - going to be a material UI
162:59 - input and what we need to do is Define
163:04 - the uh Define what how we will be
163:07 - uploading files so we will need to
163:12 - have the input with the type file with
163:16 - the this uh class name and we will be uh
163:21 - introducing an on handle change function
163:25 - which is essentially not going to be
163:27 - doing uh something super fancy it's
163:30 - basically going to be uh setting the
163:34 - image which is going to be an other
163:38 - um and that's going to be other
163:41 - um uh use state so what oops once these
163:46 - are done we just want them want to uh sa
163:51 - whatever is in input and whatever we
163:54 - uploaded to the uh file uh to the as a
163:59 - file okay next up we will be creating
164:02 - the sub Handle Sub submit which is
164:05 - essentially not going to be doing
164:07 - anything for now uh only when we
164:14 - um when we created the back end okay so
164:17 - it's just going to conso like submitting
164:20 - and that's kind of it so notice that on
164:22 - the right this is how it looks like at
164:25 - the moment but we will be adding a nice
164:28 - little uh styling in just a
164:33 - bit okay and we also want to have the
164:36 - button right which will trigger the
164:39 - handle submit uh and we also want this
164:42 - button to be completely hidden
164:46 - done okay so with that done let's
164:49 - actually go ahead and style this part so
164:54 - uh oops uh one thing we need to go ahead
164:57 - and import it because otherwise it's not
164:59 - going to work so message sender. CSS
165:04 - nice
165:07 - um nice perfect
165:10 - and there we can see it yeah so we want
165:15 - the whole thing to have like a display
165:18 - Flex We want to have like a margin on
165:21 - the top
165:23 - um we also want the flex direction to be
165:27 - column uh white background color 15%
165:30 - border radius a nice little um box
165:34 - Shadow so on the right hand side you can
165:37 - actually I think you can actually see
165:39 - all this stuff going on and with a width
165:41 - of 100% nice and we won the top
165:45 - uh to have display flexed like as you
165:47 - see everything sna into uh
165:51 - order and we want to have a uh give it a
165:56 - little border one pixel solid and this
165:59 - uh this type of white
166:01 - whsh uh pading bottom is going to be 15
166:04 - pixels and a and a general pading is
166:08 - going to be 15 pixels I don't think that
166:10 - line of code is actually going to be
166:12 - necessary ni so the padding of 15 pixels
166:16 - is that just padding all the way around
166:19 - exactly so if you're just adding that
166:21 - one thing it's going to be add it all
166:23 - the way around
166:25 - MH okay and we want to go ahead and
166:28 - Target the form and want this to be use
166:31 - up as much space as
166:34 - possible and we want to have it a
166:36 - display Flex right so it's uh actually
166:40 - updating as as I save the file right
166:44 - this is how it looks
166:45 - uh at this moment and we want to
166:48 - actually go ahead and Target the actual
166:52 - input and like
166:55 - literally design it like this so give it
166:59 - a background color of this Facebook is
167:02 - gray uh we want to have a border radius
167:07 - of 999 pixels we want to uh remove the
167:12 - margin from above and below
167:15 - and add 10 pixels to both
167:18 - sides and the padding uh it's going to
167:21 - be five pixels up and down and 20 pixels
167:24 - on both sides and we want to disable the
167:27 - borders and the outline width so that's
167:31 - kind of how it's going to be looking
167:33 - like okay nice
167:37 - and we literally want the message sender
167:40 - to be like little tiny little uh we want
167:44 - this to be uh
167:46 - not like just 20 pixels that's all we
167:50 - need and we also want the button uh to
167:54 - be completely uh
167:57 - unseeable so we will be just adding
168:01 - these uh stuff and it's done it's gone
168:05 - so the height is zero width is zero uh
168:07 - background color T transparent color
168:10 - transparent and borders
168:12 - none that's kind of what how we uh uh
168:15 - disable the button one thing which is
168:20 - um which I don't like is that this form
168:23 - is not looking like how I want it to
168:26 - look
168:27 - like
168:30 - um as it's under the
168:33 - form uh let me actually check the other
168:37 - file
168:43 - oh
168:46 - yeah so here we
168:48 - go
168:50 - um so we should be actually using up as
168:54 - much space as possible but instead well
168:57 - we are just not doing it okay okay uh
169:01 - and one thing I forgot to
169:03 - add
169:06 - is is we need to make the message sender
169:10 - input uh to be uh Flex one which means
169:14 - you use up as much space as possible and
169:17 - as we need
169:19 - right okay and now let's go ahead and
169:23 - actually create the
169:26 - bottom
169:27 - so the bottom is going to be it's not
169:31 - going to be super
169:33 - uh super hard to code but that's
169:37 - actually I have a snippet of code with
169:40 - all this stuff so what we are
169:43 - essentially doing is
169:46 - is uh basically we have the message
169:50 - message sender btom uh we have like
169:53 - message sender options inside of here so
169:55 - it's actually div inside of another div
169:58 - uh we have these uh video camera icons
170:01 - which are not imported just yet but we
170:03 - will be doing that very soon uh we want
170:07 - to add the title like actual text that
170:10 - will be rendered next to it and we are
170:13 - literally setting the color
170:15 - now I'll be going ahead and importing
170:18 - all these
170:20 - stuff yeah it's freaking out uh right so
170:25 - this is literally the uh only thing that
170:27 - you will need to import so the video cam
170:31 - icon photo library icon and the insert
170:33 - OT icon and these are the paths so it's
170:37 - pretty easy it literally tells you what
170:40 - to import and you will have all these uh
170:44 - lovely code uh icons right there so the
170:48 - red
170:49 - camera photos and the
170:53 - feing nice they look exactly like the
170:56 - Facebook ones it's awesome right so I
170:58 - bet Facebook uses a lot of material UI
171:00 - right yeah I I I actually think so I
171:04 - actually think they they really do
171:07 - it okay um
171:13 - oops
171:16 - okay so let's go back to our CSS file
171:18 - and make that look nice as well so
171:24 - um so the message sender button it
171:26 - should be display Flex again and we
171:30 - should like uh evenly uh justify the
171:34 - content right and evenly distribute the
171:38 - space and we also want to add a 20 pixel
171:43 - padding to all these uh buttons like all
171:47 - around uh we want to
171:49 - have we want to uh make them display
171:52 - Flex align everything to the center uh
171:55 - give the text uh of a gray
171:59 - color and the margin to be five
172:03 - pixels uh and let's actually set the
172:09 - um option let's actually design these
172:13 - Tex stuff so notice that uh I added a
172:17 - font size of medium right so I made it a
172:20 - bit smaller and I added a margin so
172:26 - right now there is no space in between
172:29 - here but uh as I'm adding this there is
172:33 - our space right 10 pixels I think it
172:36 - breathe I like it yeah exactly and now
172:40 - it literally looks like if it was
172:42 - Facebook yeah yeah when you don't do
172:44 - that that it looks a little bit less
172:46 - like easy to
172:47 - read yeah after you have the spacing
172:49 - then it's easier to read yeah like I
172:52 - mean it's it gives the whole thing like
172:54 - a little bit of breeding as you
172:57 - said okay um with that
173:02 - done um we also want these two uh light
173:08 - like have a little bit of background so
173:10 - if notice that if I go here it has a
173:12 - little background and and if I go here
173:15 - there's no background so I want to have
173:18 - like a
173:19 - border um no I I want to have a hover
173:24 - stuff I'm talking stupid stuff so I want
173:28 - whenever I'm hovering over I want the B
173:31 - uh background color to be set to this
173:33 - Facebook Gray and the Border radius to
173:36 - be 20 pixels right that's kind of how we
173:41 - do
173:42 - it it's super simple
173:45 - okay uh do we actually see any questions
173:49 - by the way as of now I don't see any
173:54 - inent questions people have been
173:56 - dropping guys if you guys have any
173:58 - questions you know David and I are here

174:17 - the Strong R yeah we we are actually
174:20 - 124 strong hey I mean that's the core
174:24 - team imagine imagine a room full of 128

174:40 - you're still here with us uh even
174:44 - through these hard times when we are
174:46 - facing all these technical difficulties
174:50 - right that's right let's see I think I
174:52 - got a I got a question here okay from
174:55 - yuf he says clar programmer is CSS in
174:59 - react component scoped meaning if CSS
175:02 - styling is applied only to the component
175:04 - it is imported to yes that is correct
175:07 - but don't forget that you can actually
175:11 - import the same CSS file to over all the
175:16 - components so normally so the CSS is
175:20 - only applied to that component where you
175:23 - uh import it but you can go ahead and
175:26 - import it to several other components as
175:31 - well okay
175:34 - um
175:36 - nice let's actually uh go on and I think
175:42 - we are done with the message sender we
175:44 - are done
175:45 - with uh stories let's go what's left the
175:49 - right I think right side bar our right
175:52 - side bar is definitely left and we we
175:56 - need the posts don't forget about the
175:59 - posts the post yeah that's
176:01 - right so we have all this stuff going on
176:04 - here but what we need now is going to be
176:10 - the
176:12 - um so so the
176:15 - post. JS right we also have the post.
176:22 - CSS so notice that whenever I I'm
176:25 - creating a JS file I'm uh immediately
176:29 - creating the uh CSS file to it so that
176:33 - we have it also uh the div should
176:36 - automatically include uh the class
176:39 - name that we want to use which is at
176:42 - this moment is going to be be post and
176:45 - I'm already importing the uh post. CSS
176:50 - file so I want forget it and let me
176:55 - actually see if we are missing
176:58 - anything so yeah we have the story we
177:02 - have the message sender now we need to
177:05 - go with the post so let's actually go
177:09 - ahead and import post now I'm Auto
177:12 - importing again so up uh it's going to
177:15 - be
177:17 - here and what I need to do is basically
177:21 - uh pass in a couple of stuff so we are
177:25 - literally passing in the profile pick
177:27 - because a post has a user which uh who
177:31 - who actually has the profile pick right
177:34 - oh damn hold on uh so I'm going to
177:40 - be uh adding the usual uh SU
177:44 - pick and we also will have a
177:48 - message which is going to be yo this is
177:52 - a message nice can you hit command B to
177:55 - hide the side what's up can you hit
177:57 - command B oh yeah yeah right thanks
177:59 - thanks yeah we are also going to have a
178:02 - time stamp which we will be using to
178:05 - sort everything so that the most recent
178:08 - one is going to be up top and all the
178:10 - others are going to be down below but
178:13 - right now let's just go with
178:15 - time and we will have an image name I
178:18 - will explain that later on why we need
178:20 - that but we need to get the front end
178:23 - working first like looking nice and then
178:25 - we can jump into the back end and then I
178:27 - can explain why it's uh the way it is so
178:31 - the image name is going to be uh image
178:34 - name for
178:36 - now and we will have a
178:39 - username uh which is going to be uh
178:43 - let's let's go with with Frankie because
178:45 - Frankie's name and Sunny's picture is
178:47 - the best
178:49 - combo Best of Both
178:51 - Worlds yeah
178:53 - exactly nice so we literally have a uh
178:59 - post ready for us which is not getting
179:02 - rendered out because the post is
179:04 - actually empty so
179:08 - um what we are going to be doing is
179:11 - basically destructure everything that
179:13 - that we receive we can do that like this
179:17 - so we are putting these quiggly braces
179:19 - profile pick image name username time
179:21 - stamp message all this kind of
179:23 - stuff uh nice and what we will be doing
179:29 - is so the post actually has two
179:32 - parts again actually yeah yeah two
179:37 - parts so one of them is going to be the
179:42 - um post
179:46 - top uh which will include an
179:49 - avatar uh which is going to be so the
179:52 - source is going to be the actual profile
179:55 - pick right that's what we are passing in
179:59 - and the class name is going to be post
180:04 - aat Avatar right
180:09 - nice so yep and next up we will have
180:13 - have a post top info which is literally
180:17 - not going to uh include too much stuff
180:20 - it's basically going to include the Tim
180:22 - stamp and the user's name right so not
180:28 - nothing super fancy but we will have it
180:31 - uh so that it yeah so that it functions
180:36 - nicely
180:37 - so what we are doing here so we we have
180:40 - the Avatar right here we we have the
180:44 - username the h3e right here which is
180:48 - Frankie and we have this line of code
180:50 - which I'm explaining just
180:53 - now so what we are doing here is we
180:56 - basically grab this Tim stamp we will be
180:59 - parsing it into an integer I will
181:02 - explain that later uh when we have the
181:05 - co uh backend code ready so we will be
181:09 - uh creating we will be uh having uh time
181:13 - stamp something like uh it starts with
181:15 - 116 and then like comes random numbers
181:19 - this basically means that the how much
181:22 - seconds have uh passed since I think
181:27 - 1980 Something Right 198 something yeah
181:30 - yeah Unix time time date I don't know
181:34 - what it's called yeah yeah exactly and
181:37 - we will be um passing that into here but
181:42 - we are going to be storing it as a
181:44 - string inside of our database so first
181:46 - we need to forse it into an
181:49 - integer uh and we will make it a date
181:52 - format right so new date and we want to
181:56 - uh display it as a UTC string so notice
182:00 - that over here how it looks
182:04 - like boom that's what we will have and I
182:08 - think UTC string for those that don't
182:11 - know so UTC is the winter time of
182:17 - Britain so you know uh all the time
182:20 - zones are adjusted to uh England's time
182:24 - zone but actually England switches a
182:27 - time zone between summer and winter and
182:30 - so that everybody has like a standard
182:33 - only uh like time zone that doesn't
182:36 - switch all around because United States
182:38 - actually changes times uh at a different
182:41 - like I think two weeks ahead of Europe
182:44 - or after Europe I don't know so there is
182:46 - a two we Delay from for uh one of
182:51 - those uh when you're switching to summer
182:54 - time or or the Standard Time interesting
182:58 - I didn't know that yeah and the UTC is
183:01 - basically the the winter time zone of
183:05 - England right so it's kind of like
183:07 - that's what so if you're have like an
183:09 - international business and you you're
183:14 - setting up servers you want to go with
183:15 - UTC times always and you want to convert
183:18 - the UTC time uh uh according to where
183:23 - the information is relevant so actually
183:27 - this is kind of like what type of uh how
183:30 - it looks like uh I don't think I can
183:33 - show uh that too much but let's try it
183:37 - this way so I just uh flashlight it on
183:42 - this uh line of string I think I'm going
183:45 - to just go ahead grab it and so that you
183:48 - guys are going to be able to see how
183:51 - things change when I'm passing that
183:56 - um so this number instead of time so
184:01 - notice that right now it's yeah so it
184:04 - was invalid but as soon as I pass this
184:07 - thing in it turned into this stuff
184:11 - right it's pretty pretty sick
184:14 - and it actually shows it in GMT time
184:17 - zone
184:18 - nice um so with that
184:24 - done uh we kind of have one post
184:30 - ready uh yeah
184:33 - perfect
184:34 - and we will be adding more stuff uh once
184:39 - we have our back end so for now uh let's
184:43 - not worry about the image
184:45 - name uh and all those kind of stuff uh
184:48 - for now let's actually add the reaction
184:53 - things so let's just make a note here so
184:57 - image has is coming
185:03 - later so yeah it's freaking out again
185:05 - because I have all these icons not
185:08 - imported but let's just uh do that right
185:12 - now
185:17 - so here we go
185:21 - nice and we have all these icons right
185:25 - here so it's pretty much just adding the
185:28 - thumbs up with the uh text and we had
185:32 - the post option or we could like
185:34 - literally say post reaction and notice
185:37 - that there is another uh class which is
185:39 - post options it's plural so we are
185:42 - adding all this stuff nice okay
185:47 - uh I will be zooming out a bit out of it
185:51 - let's actually go ahead and style
185:56 - it okay so the whole post will have a
186:00 - width of 100% margin or radius 15 pixels
186:05 - uh
186:07 - background I think it should be
186:09 - color uh
186:11 - White and like give it a box Shadow nice
186:16 - uh we will have the post image later on
186:19 - don't worry about it for now it's going
186:21 - to be a width of 100% and nothing
186:24 - else uh Post stop we want that to be
186:28 - display
186:29 - Flex um oh damn I think
186:34 - I screw yeah uh I
186:38 - think oh okay so I added a post options
186:42 - inside side of post
186:46 - um post top info and post top so I want
186:50 - that to be out of that right right just
186:54 - like that okay so this is how I want
186:56 - this to look like for
186:59 - now nice okay uh so post up
187:05 - and we actually want the post Avatar to
187:09 - have a margin R of 10
187:11 - pixels and we want the posttop info so
187:15 - literally the name we want that to have
187:18 - the font size of
187:19 - medium and the we want the time stamp
187:26 - which is under the P tag we want it to
187:29 - be gray and we want that to be
187:32 - small so and the post button I think
187:36 - that's going to be the
187:38 - image so let's just add it to here and
187:41 - once we have the back end ready we will
187:43 - be working with the post
187:46 - button so it's going to have a margin
187:48 - top of 10 pixels margin buttom 10 pixels
187:51 - and the padding uh uh top and below is
187:55 - going to be 15 pixels and 25 right and
187:58 - the left nice okay and the post options
188:02 - which we have just
188:04 - added it's going to have a padding of
188:08 - 10% uh 10 pixels uh one pixel solid
188:12 - light gray uh border
188:15 - top uh literally that thing over there
188:19 - uh we want them to be display Flex so
188:22 - they are right next to each other uh
188:24 - justify content space evenly and font
188:27 - size
188:29 - medium and we also want the color to be
188:31 - gray and the cursors to be pointer and
188:34 - the padding of 15 pixels
188:37 - nice uh we also wanton the post
188:42 - option
188:44 - uh each and every one of them so that we
188:46 - have the text like right next to the
188:49 - them uh we want them to be centered in
188:53 - every single way so vertically and
188:55 - horizontally and we also want the P also
188:58 - want to give them a pading of five
189:00 - pixels and we want them to uh
189:05 - float nice uh so
189:10 - post
189:11 - whoops so post option
189:15 - b uh we we are actually literally
189:17 - targeting the text uh Tex stuff going on
189:22 - here right so only only the like
189:28 - right I hope it's clear uh only and only
189:31 - the comment so not uh we're not
189:35 - targeting this time um the icon so it's
189:40 - crossed out wow I love love this screen
189:44 - brush thing that is amazing okay yeah
189:48 - okay uh
189:51 - oops and once we hover over we want to
189:56 - give it the usual uh Facebook Gray and
189:59 - the Border radius of 10 pixels so just
190:02 - that
190:03 - thing okay nice uh I think we kind of
190:07 - are
190:09 - done uh with designing how it looks like
190:14 - for now really nice really really nice
190:17 - so what does it mean when it's
190:19 - floating um I think it's kind of like
190:23 - floating above uh it would be my guess
190:26 - soing on the bottom it's what's up like
190:30 - the padding or the little like it gives
190:31 - it space on the
190:33 - bottom I think it's like a 3D animation
190:36 - ah I see I see yeah yeah yeah um one
190:40 - thing though we haven't added
190:43 - is the actual
190:47 - um post message so we need that in
190:50 - between the post top and the post
190:53 - options boom there we go that's going to
190:55 - be the message
190:58 - right and inside of the post button
191:01 - there that's where the image is actually
191:04 - going to come later on
191:07 - Boom here we go so for now post is done
191:12 - uh but we will be working on it a bit uh
191:15 - very
191:16 - soon okay nice
191:19 - um and let's actually I think the last
191:22 - thing last to
191:24 - do uh on the front end side is going to
191:26 - be the
191:29 - widget I mean I I think so going to be
191:32 - the right the right side bar yeah
191:35 - exactly that's actually we will be
191:37 - calling that the
191:39 - widget um. JS nice
191:43 - and what we will have here is
191:45 - essentially an an
191:48 - iframe which we are so let's actually
191:51 - first add the class
191:55 - name so it's going to be
191:58 - widgets and what we have here is
192:01 - basically an iframe which is kind of
192:03 - like embedding another uh web page to
192:06 - your website right so we're um so you
192:10 - can literally go ahead Google it up like
192:13 - uh Facebook embed iframe I think this
192:17 - three keywords if it's in your Google
192:19 - search it will show it up and Facebook
192:22 - is literally giving you this code and I
192:24 - set up the width to uh 340 head uh, 1500
192:30 - and inline styling so just you know like
192:33 - there is the CSS kind of styling and
192:34 - there is the inline styling we kind of
192:36 - want to show you
192:38 - both uh so the style of border is going
192:40 - to be none overflow so whenever it's um
192:44 - going
192:45 - over uh on those 1500 pixels we just
192:48 - want that to be hidden uh we don't want
192:51 - it to scroll uh frame border is going to
192:53 - be zero uh transparency un encrypted
192:57 - media so these are literally like stuff
193:00 - that Facebook is giving you and the
193:02 - reason why Facebook gives you that link
193:05 - is because we chose to share what's in
193:08 - right now our
193:10 - live uh Facebook of
193:13 - clever programmer right so yeah exactly
193:16 - the the items that are going to populate
193:18 - inside of that if frame that David right
193:21 - now is writing is actually the real
193:23 - things that are being posted on our
193:25 - Facebook feed that's what you guys are
193:27 - going to see exactly and Whoa man two
193:30 - donations at the same time it's like
193:31 - they paired up at the same
193:33 - time thank you thank you so much man he
193:35 - says you guys are doing great and then a
193:37 - ro says you guys are great let me see
193:39 - you guys are great keep up the good work
193:41 - thank you so much
193:43 - thank you so much thank you so much lit
193:46 - that's the core team that we still have
193:48 - yeah that's what we core team of 109
193:52 - people thank you guys literally if you
193:55 - like it stay with us yep yep stay till
193:58 - the end guys you guys are going to pick
193:59 - up a few great
194:01 - skills yeah
194:04 - exactly okay um and please do not spam
194:08 - the chat because I will block you I
194:10 - already blocked rush rush
194:15 - yeah okay um I think with that said we
194:20 - can literally go ahead
194:22 - and start up the backend stock so
194:27 - Frankie actually set up a mongod DB but
194:31 - I'm just going to go ahead and show it
194:32 - because there was so many stuff going on
194:35 - and things were like crashing and all
194:37 - this kind of stuff I'm just going to
194:39 - show everything once again this is uh
194:42 - actually the live applications database
194:45 - at the moment I just refreshed it and
194:47 - there is all this stuff going
194:50 - on so
194:52 - yep uh so what you can do uh is
194:55 - literally create a new project I will be
194:58 - uh going ahead and name it like FB
195:02 - M uh I think that's going to be more
195:05 - than enough I'm not adding any members
195:09 - uh over here so that's where you could
195:11 - add like uh if I
195:12 - I can
195:14 - actually uh invite
195:16 - Frankie
195:18 - um to join if he wants to nice and I can
195:24 - actually like literally add like uh read
195:27 - write manager and access admin and I'll
195:31 - be the um project owner so it's kind of
195:35 - nice so we both will be able to work on
195:39 - this project thank you nice anytime
195:44 - dude so let's go ahead and create the uh
195:48 - project let's go build the cluster it's
195:51 - um popping this question to me every
195:53 - single time but Pro most of the times it
195:56 - just doesn't do it it's just for some
195:58 - reason for me it does it uh and you want
196:02 - to go ahead and create a free cluster we
196:05 - don't need all these feny stuff we're is
196:07 - going to go with precluster you don't
196:09 - need to worry about any of this stuff
196:11 - going on and what I'm just going to do
196:13 - is create a cluster with the
196:17 - button nice uh and it's going to act so
196:21 - it says it's going to take 1 to three
196:23 - minutes but it actually usually does a
196:25 - bit more uh by that time I will be going
196:29 - ahead and uh hitting network access that
196:33 - button over there and I'll be uh adding
196:37 - an IP address nice so this time I will
196:41 - be adding allow access from any anywhere
196:47 - but
196:50 - disclaimer do not do it in production do
196:53 - not do it with any kind of client
196:58 - because this literally means that I
197:00 - could hack your database and I could do
197:02 - whatever I wanted to do inside of it and
197:04 - that's kind of like losing money so you
197:06 - don't want to do this in production you
197:09 - always want to get the IP address of the
197:12 - server that is going to be using it and
197:14 - add it inside of here you can literally
197:17 - add the comment I will be naming
197:20 - everyone uh but you can add it add like
197:24 - whatever server so the client name uh
197:27 - server uh and you can actually set it to
197:31 - uh six hour long
197:33 - whoops too much stuff uh six hour long
197:37 - so it's GNA expire but I'm just gonna
197:39 - not do that for
197:40 - now okay so it's going to uh work for a
197:45 - bit uh it's still deploying CH uh my
197:48 - changes and by the time I will be going
197:51 - ahead and uh set up the database access
197:54 - which is
197:55 - essentially uh creating a database
197:59 - user um so I'll be naming it uh Facebook
198:04 - client um aut to generate a SQL password
198:09 - and you want to go ahead and copy that
198:11 - as much times as possible so that you
198:14 - will have that on your clipboard I'm
198:17 - using offred so I'll I'm having it in a
198:21 - safe place but if you're not using
198:23 - offred you definitely well first you
198:25 - want to go ahead and download it or just
198:28 - go ahead and like add somewhere safe
198:30 - inside of your code so that you will
198:32 - have it because this is the last time
198:34 - you will actually see this
198:36 - password and let's go and hit user or
198:40 - add user nice
198:42 - so going back to the Clusters it's still
198:44 - being created it's doing its stuff nice
198:47 - uh but by the time let's actually go
198:50 - ahead and create our
198:55 - um backend stuff right so first thing
199:01 - first we will
199:04 - be what is this thing okay we don't need
199:07 - this stuff so first thing first we will
199:10 - be creating a new
199:13 - folder uh outside of here so it's going
199:16 - to be Facebook
199:18 - backend uh for
199:20 - me and I'm opening up a new
199:24 - terminal um I'll be actually create
199:28 - a um how do I create oh it's a plus
199:33 - button nice um so I'll be seeding into
199:38 - the Facebook
199:40 - backend and now now that I'm inside of
199:43 - here I want to have Git Version Control
199:45 - uh initialized so I'm just going to type
199:47 - in in
199:49 - it
199:51 - um why it's taking this much time I have
199:53 - no
199:55 - clue okay nice I must have uh made a
200:00 - typo and now I'm going to go ahead and
200:03 - start up the backend stuff right so I'm
200:06 - going to go ahead and type in mpm in it
200:08 - which is literally initializing our
200:11 - backend project what's up so two things
200:13 - two things one Vibe with us just dropped
200:17 - a beautiful comment much love thank you
200:19 - guys so much and he says Hey CP I just
200:22 - want to say thank you for all your

200:30 - two years in campus basically where I am
200:33 - right now is because of you
200:35 - wow he's learning that's literally what
200:38 - our goal is so I'm actually attending
200:41 - the college as as well and um I've been
200:45 - there for like 2 and a half years and
200:49 - while I was inside of pwj and watching
200:52 - these lives and actually now doing these

200:57 - what I when uh what college has gave me
201:00 - W that's crazy man even even in
201:02 - debugging like today that was crazy
201:06 - oh so much bonjour Tech thank you man a
201:09 - $5 donation beautiful we love you guys

201:46 - we are 122 active user uh
201:51 - Watchers so awesome let's let's teach
201:54 - everybody how to code let's get it yeah
201:56 - exactly okay let's jump back into the
201:59 - code okay so we have the uh G Version
202:05 - Control
202:06 - initialized and what I'm going to do now
202:08 - is essentially initialize the backend
202:11 - Pro
202:14 - uh okay I was in the wrong W uh window
202:17 - okay so this is going to throw so when I
202:20 - type in mpm in it it's going to throw a
202:24 - couple of lines here which I've honestly
202:26 - never
202:27 - read uh this is I think it's some kind
202:31 - of General advices and stuff uh but
202:35 - right now I'm going to go ahead and name
202:36 - the package give a
202:39 - version description I'm going to leave
202:41 - it alone entry point make sure to set it
202:43 - to
202:44 - server.js test command empty get rippo
202:47 - empty keywords empty author uh
202:51 - Frankie oops and David whoops and the
202:57 - license is I see perfect now uh it's
202:59 - going to prompt if I'm okay with it yes
203:02 - I am so there we go so the Facebook back
203:05 - end now that we are done uh let's
203:08 - actually import a couple of dependencies
203:11 - and we will have a bunch of them this
203:15 - time so make sure to watch it as I'm
203:19 - doing it so I'm just going to type in
203:22 - mpm install and we will of course have
203:25 - Express we will have Mongoose we will
203:28 - have course we will have motor which we
203:31 - will be using to upload the image anyway
203:35 - you can actually drag it a little bit up
203:37 - so that we can see it on the screen it's
203:39 - like cut cutting up a little bit I mean
203:42 - what I could do is exit full
203:45 - screen and like do it like this I I I I
203:49 - hope it's it's better now it's cool okay
203:54 - nice um so we
203:58 - have so we have Express we have mongus
204:01 - we have course we have motor to up
204:04 - upload images and now we will have
204:07 - motor uh grid FS which is a no stuff so
204:12 - guys if you're already here this is
204:14 - going to be the juicy part this is going
204:16 - to be new stuff and this is what like
204:19 - literally is going to make the
204:22 - difference uh it's actually a motor grid
204:25 - of a storage so this is how we will be
204:27 - storing mod IM oops images inside of
204:30 - mongod
204:32 - DB uh we will also have crit
204:36 - FS uh stream and we will have the body
204:40 - parser
204:42 - oops body parser
204:46 - nice we also want to have path and we
204:49 - want to have Pusher because we want this
204:53 - we will make this real time okay so all
204:58 - these packages are going to take a bit
205:00 - of time to load but I mean I just hit
205:03 - return uh on all
205:06 - these and I'm just going to go full
205:08 - screen once
205:10 - again so so it's quickly set up and we
205:14 - also we already have the package.json
205:16 - file nice I will be closing the terminal
205:19 - because we don't need that anymore um
205:23 - and what we really want to do is up here
205:27 - like right on the main
205:30 - server.js we want to type in
205:33 - type and the type that we want to select
205:36 - is module that will allow us to write
205:40 - es6 code
205:42 - uh inside of inside of here and next
205:47 - thing we want to do is
205:49 - start and that's going to be node
205:52 - server.js it's going to be necessary uh
205:56 - for when we deploy the app to uh Heroku
206:01 - we will not need to worry about Auto
206:03 - starting the app is going to start
206:06 - itself up next thing you want to do uh
206:09 - is add a dog ignore
206:15 - file uh because right now on the left
206:18 - hand left hand side I hope I can move
206:21 - this thing
206:23 - away
206:28 - um okay so over there you can see it
206:31 - says 2K that's because we have the node
206:35 - modules uh inside of the uh Version
206:39 - Control so I'm just going to type in
206:41 - node modules and boom that's went back
206:44 - to
206:47 - 27 uh get ignore
206:51 - nice and with that
206:54 - done uh let's actually go ahead and
206:58 - create our server.js file which is for
207:00 - some reason the focus is always lost
207:04 - server.js nice so inside of here we what
207:09 - you literally want to do is import
207:11 - everything so import Express from
207:14 - Express uh you want to go ahead and
207:16 - import [ __ ] from [ __ ] uh course motor
207:20 - and all those stuff that we just did uh
207:22 - you can go ahead post your video here
207:25 - copy all this stuff this is how you want
207:28 - to go ahead whoops this is how you want
207:30 - to go ahead and import
207:32 - everything nice
207:36 - um what we will be doing as well is gri
207:40 - [ __ ] is going to be mongus [ __ ] we
207:43 - will be using it later on we will be um
207:47 - this is literally the storage that we
207:50 - will be uh adding our images to okay
207:55 - next up uh what we always do is line out
207:58 - the whole app so we will have an app
208:01 - config uh we will have middle
208:05 - Wares
208:08 - oh
208:10 - yep we will have some DB config it's
208:14 - going to be brutal
208:16 - today and we will
208:20 - need um API
208:23 - routes nice and we want to have a listen
208:31 - part okay so let's actually cover all
208:34 - these stuff so app config is for now
208:38 - it's just going to uh it's really create
208:41 - the instance and Define the port where
208:44 - the application is going to run at next
208:47 - up we will have the metal Wares so first
208:51 - thing first we will have the body parser
208:53 - which will literally uh parse everything
208:56 - into Json format so that we will be able
209:00 - to make rest requests and we will have
209:03 - nice Json
209:04 - response and we are also using the
209:07 - course headers just
209:10 - there
209:12 - okay perfect um and let's actually
209:15 - create our first very first API uh
209:20 - request and that is going to be a routes
209:24 - nice uh so we want so what here happens
209:29 - is whenever I'm calling the
209:32 - app uh with a get method I'm going to
209:35 - show everything to you
209:36 - guys on the rout so there is no no
209:41 - endpoint just the API
209:43 - itself and that will fire off a function
209:46 - which has a request and a response uh
209:50 - property uh then what we want to do is
209:54 - set the response status to um 200 which
209:58 - means in server side language it means
210:01 - okay and then we want to go ahead and
210:04 - send back whoops
210:06 - uh hello
210:09 - world world
210:12 - nice
210:13 - and I think uh a bracket was
210:18 - gone and now I think we should be good
210:21 - but for some reason we are
210:23 - not
210:27 - um okay
210:30 - nice yeah so this is how the full line
210:32 - is going to look
210:34 - like okay
210:36 - [Music]
210:37 - awesome and we also want to go ahead and
210:40 - make the up listen which we will be able
210:43 - to do by say app.
210:45 - listen and that is where we pass in the
210:48 - port that we uh
210:51 - defined uh up
210:54 - here so this thing so it literally we we
210:57 - could actually say 9,000 but we we uh we
211:01 - are saying for instead so we can
211:04 - literally go ahead and like set it the
211:07 - way we want
211:08 - to and so yep and let's fire off a
211:14 - console
211:16 - log which will just give us an idea of
211:19 - where everything if everything is going
211:22 - right so this time I'm not using
211:24 - quotation marks I'm using backx which is
211:27 - on the United States keyboard it's right
211:29 - next to number
211:30 - one uh and on the British keyboard it's
211:35 - next to zed nice and guess what David we
211:39 - just got another donation rash Nish
211:41 - Kumar Gupta say hey thank you so much
211:45 - love you guys and I was not spamming a
211:47 - thank you man I appreciate you sometimes
211:49 - we just see repeated messages so we have
211:51 - to you know clear out the chat block a
211:53 - few people we want to keep it so that
211:55 - everybody can have a good learning
211:57 - environment but we really appreciate
211:59 - your donation man thank you so much
212:01 - thank you a lot yeah
212:02 - yeah um so let's get back to the code so
212:06 - what we want to type in here is
212:08 - basically like listening on local host
212:12 - and you can literally like add in with
212:14 - the string connation the actual
212:18 - Port so that's pretty much setting up
212:21 - our very first API it's I mean lots of
212:24 - stuff is not even needed here like all
212:26 - this stuff um but yeah we we will be
212:30 - just adding those
212:32 - anyways we will be using all of these
212:34 - stuff later on nice so we could
212:39 - literally make the app
212:41 - uh
212:42 - listen okay perfect and let's actually
212:46 - fire it up so I'm just going to go ahead
212:49 - and say
212:52 - um I think it's FB back in nice perfect
212:57 - and I'm going to say node Manon
212:59 - [Music]
213:01 - server.js oh okay it even found with
213:06 - chaos okay nice so it's actually running
213:10 - and I'll be opening up a thing called
213:14 - Postman which is a nice little app uh
213:17 - that we can use to
213:21 - uh to call the uh to make requests so
213:27 - I'm going to closing up everything here
213:30 - all these mess and I'm just going to go
213:33 - ahead and type in Local
213:36 - Host and
213:38 - 9,000 and I think I can zoom into this
213:40 - one one as well uh is it easy to read
213:43 - Frankie yeah now it's better perfect and
213:47 - because it says hello world that's how
213:49 - we know everything is working
213:52 - fine so let's give it an air horn
213:56 - actually we have our first API let's get
213:59 - it first API nice yeah
214:04 - exactly
214:07 - okay so next up what we want to do is
214:10 - let's go back to mongod DB uh during
214:14 - this
214:15 - time sorry my hair during this time uh
214:19 - our cluster got set up and now let's go
214:23 - uh oops I hit the wrong button so you
214:26 - want to press connect and
214:31 - you and you want to press uh connect
214:34 - connect your application nice and just
214:37 - copy this
214:38 - thing and let's hide it
214:41 - and inside of uh DB config you
214:44 - definitely want to go ahead and create a
214:46 - const [ __ ]
214:50 - U
214:52 - and and actually go ahead and paste this
214:55 - thing inside of here
214:57 - but notice that it has this password
215:02 - thing which is not the password that we
215:05 - had this is why you needed to save the
215:08 - password when I said we need it so you
215:11 - want to go ahead
215:13 - and and paste your password inside of
215:17 - there
215:19 - boom oh oh damn okay um I'm pressing
215:25 - buttons all the way boom uh so that's my
215:28 - password right now and for the DB name I
215:32 - actually like to I'd like to call it
215:36 - Facebook DB I think it's pretty
215:39 - descriptive right
215:41 - okay now what you need to
215:44 - do basically we will create two
215:46 - different kind of
215:48 - connections um but it's basically it's
215:51 - going to be almost the same the only
215:54 - thing that we will be doing differently
215:58 - is first we need to save it into a
216:01 - variable and we are using the create
216:04 - connection function and the other one is
216:07 - just simply connecting so whenever the
216:09 - server is starting in up we will be uh
216:12 - creating a connection and this is what
216:15 - we will be using for the GS storage and
216:18 - the other one is going to be like a
216:20 - general
216:21 - connection uh for saving the posts uh
216:26 - there is a bit of difference between
216:28 - these but I just don't want to go into
216:30 - it because it's uh super super hard to
216:34 - understand um so now let's go ahead and
216:39 - actually
216:41 - initialize uh let's actually say that
216:45 - whenever
216:47 - um let's actually uh say that once the
216:52 - first connection is done uh so we we
216:56 - were able to set it up we want a console
216:59 - log DB connected and we want to create a
217:05 - GFS um which we actually need to uh say
217:11 - we actually need to initialize here
217:12 - what's a GFS so GFS is going to be grid
217:16 - FS uh and gr FS is I think it's GD file
217:20 - system it's basically a file system for
217:22 - mongod DB so what happens is it's
217:26 - actually it's normally it's created for
217:29 - files that are larger than 16 uh MB
217:34 - but we would just use this for every
217:37 - single file uh and because normally you
217:41 - could use the binary way and the base 64
217:44 - code for actually saving images but
217:48 - that's like crazy
217:49 - hardcore and you just don't want to do
217:51 - that uh this is a much simpler uh way to
217:55 - do it right
217:58 - um and what you want to do is so when so
218:02 - it's initialized you want to create the
218:04 - grid and the connection uh DB is uh
218:09 - going to be in side of here and we will
218:12 - pass in the mongus [ __ ] so and the
218:15 - great collection so the collection where
218:18 - we want to save all these images uh is
218:21 - going to be images
218:23 - right and one thing so grid FS storage
218:27 - is literally um saving stuff in like 200
218:33 - kilobyte of chunks right and that's how
218:36 - we are actually saving it and we will
218:38 - just put it together uh when we're
218:40 - retrieving
218:42 - stuff okay and the other thing we need
218:46 - to uh have to set this thing up
218:50 - finally is is creating the storage so
218:53 - it's going to be new grid FS storage
218:56 - with the URL of [ __ ] URI which we have
218:59 - up
219:00 - here and the file so it's kind of like
219:06 - when we create the um
219:11 - this schema for this for the
219:14 - files and we're doing the exact same
219:17 - stuff here as well so we will have a
219:19 - file name uh which we are concatenating
219:22 - out of uh the word image a dash and the
219:26 - date now and the actual extension of the
219:29 - file and the other one is going to be a
219:32 - file
219:33 - info uh which is going to be consist of
219:36 - the file name and the bucket name which
219:39 - is images as we are saving our stuff
219:42 - into the images collection so pretty
219:44 - much the file is going to be whatever
219:46 - type of image right that we're putting
219:48 - in yeah exactly exct I mean it literally
219:51 - could accept videos as
219:55 - well
219:58 - okay so yep and we're just going to
220:01 - resolve it with this stuff nice uh and
220:06 - the
220:07 - upload instance is going to be this um
220:12 - motor so whenever we are uploading a
220:14 - file to uh to this uh server it's going
220:19 - to be using this storage to store it
220:24 - immediately without asking any questions
220:27 - so this gives us our next API
220:32 - route which is going to be this thing uh
220:35 - for Simplicity I'm just going to delete
220:37 - that so whenever we are calling the app
220:40 - with a post method on the SL upload SL
220:44 - image and point and we attach a file
220:47 - which we need to do in a bit of a
220:50 - different way than we just normally
220:52 - create a Json
220:54 - file uh it will fire off a request
220:57 - response uh callback function and we
221:01 - just literally just send back the file
221:03 - and all the details so let's try it out
221:06 - very
221:07 - quickly um inside of here so upload uh
221:12 - image I think yeah that's the thing we
221:15 - want to have and whenever we are
221:19 - using um what's called it Postman you
221:23 - want to go to the body you want to go to
221:24 - form data set the text to file actually
221:28 - and what you want to go ahead and select
221:32 - is
221:33 - um I have a couple of images over here
221:36 - so I'm just going to go use this uh
221:39 - profit which JavaScript
221:41 - logo um yep and it's going to be inside
221:45 - of there and if it's working perfectly
221:48 - and I hope it does when I send it oh
221:52 - because I'm getting it let's
221:55 - go what is happening un unexpected
222:02 - field okay here comes the debu session
222:06 - hey ready for that let's get
222:08 - it
222:10 - [Music]
222:14 - yeah so we are expecting the file
222:19 - right
222:21 - um let's see what the terminal says
222:25 - actually let's
222:28 - restart nice nice DB connected
222:32 - perfect
222:36 - um so we're
222:38 - actually okay I know what happened so
222:42 - what happened is that I didn't give a
222:44 - name for the field and we are actually
222:49 - expecting the file to be file coming in
222:52 - the file name uh file name field so the
222:56 - that should be a field which has a file
222:58 - name and that's where our file will be
223:02 - nice okay so add file let's send it
223:05 - again and now it's taking longer so it's
223:07 - good and these are literally the stuff
223:11 - that we had okay uh let's just uh see
223:15 - what's going on field name file right
223:19 - original name original name it was
223:24 - image.png it was a 7 bit image uh it was
223:27 - a PNG file uh it gave them random ID
223:31 - which is some mongod DB stuff don't
223:33 - worry about it and the new F name is
223:36 - this stuff right so this is the uh with
223:39 - with the date
223:41 - string uh all this stuff we don't need
223:44 - to really worry about it um there is
223:47 - some lot of uh nice stuff going on here
223:50 - if you want
223:51 - to spend time finding it out go ahead
223:55 - but it's just not relevant for today's
223:57 - build oh my God we're doing it for such
223:59 - a long time yeah it's a marathon we've
224:02 - been here a while yeah oh Jesus it's
224:06 - actually 1 a.m. here oh wow
224:10 - yeah 4M here yeah yeah yeah I actually
224:14 - have my I have this computer set to uh
224:17 - Los Angel
224:18 - time now I'm I'm working with you guys
224:21 - so I I just want to know what the time
224:23 - oh my God I have a call with Alex in
224:25 - less than half an hour oh wow that's
224:29 - okay no sleep
224:31 - tonight yeah
224:33 - exactly ah sleep is for for the week for
224:38 - humans yeah
224:40 - okay next up um what the usual stuff
224:44 - that we always do is actually what we
224:47 - want to do is have a schema for our
224:51 - database
224:54 - right so what that it's going to be it's
224:57 - like uh post model. JS right it's
225:02 - basically we are creating a uh database
225:06 - model so what we are doing here is let's
225:10 - type it up so we are importing
225:13 - [ __ ] uh from whoops uh mango right uh
225:18 - and we are going to be creating a uh
225:21 - post
225:24 - model uh which is going to be a [ __ ] do
225:27 - [ __ ]
225:28 - schema and this is where we Define all
225:32 - the fields so we will have a user which
225:35 - is going to be a
225:37 - string we will have an image name name
225:40 - I'll tell you why uh we need this so
225:42 - much but we need it uh that's going to
225:45 - be a string of course uh text which is
225:50 - literally going to be whatever the uh
225:53 - person wants the text of the uh
225:58 - post so that's going to be string
226:01 - again we are going to be saving the
226:05 - Avatar uh so that we can so whenever the
226:09 - person logs in with Google which is yet
226:12 - to
226:13 - come
226:14 - um we will be uh saving the the Avatar
226:19 - to the database so that when we refresh
226:22 - the application and render out
226:23 - everything again we will see the nice
226:26 - Avatar going on okay and the last but
226:30 - not least the time
226:32 - stamp whoops which is going to be a
226:35 - string as well and we need to export Rec
226:39 - it yep what's up all of them
226:42 - strings yeah everything everything is
226:45 - strings that that's the easiest way to
226:46 - go about it honestly oops um made a
226:51 - typo I mean there are all these data
226:55 - types but string is the
226:58 - easiest so we will be exporting a [ __ ]
227:02 - model
227:03 - right and we need to uh give the
227:07 - collection name here where we want to
227:09 - say it so it's going to be post it
227:11 - always plural uh this is something you
227:14 - need to watch out and we were actually
227:15 - danging it with sunny for
227:18 - minutes uh that mongodb pluralizes all
227:22 - the connection names so the best thing
227:25 - is to Define them plural uh by
227:29 - default and we are actually adding the
227:31 - post model as the model to
227:34 - it nice so we pretty much have it let's
227:40 - actually go back here and import that
227:43 - too so we will be importing uh DB post I
227:49 - think
227:51 - um
227:53 - oops
227:55 - h no actually we will import [ __ ]
228:01 - post
228:03 - and we will be uh importing the post
228:07 - model uh
228:10 - .js file whoops oh my God okay uh so
228:15 - down here we now what we want to do is
228:20 - literally just save a
228:22 - post um and what we will be doing uh
228:27 - when we save these stuff is we go ahead
228:31 - uh save the image first into the storage
228:35 - into the images collection and
228:38 - afterwards uh we will be going ahead and
228:42 - saving the image name with the post to
228:45 - to another collection so that way we
228:48 - will have track of everything so which
228:51 - image uh goes with which post right so
228:55 - that's what we will be doing just now so
228:58 - let's go ahead and create an app toop
229:01 - post on the um upload
229:08 - whoops
229:09 - upload slash
229:12 - poost and will fire off a request
229:15 - response uh callback function and inside
229:19 - of here what you want to do is basically
229:23 - save uh whatever comes in the request
229:26 - body and you can go ahead and conso log
229:29 - it but I'll just not do it uh for now
229:32 - and this is where we
229:35 - call
229:37 - uh the uh mod that we just created right
229:41 - so you can go back and see what's up
229:43 - here and we will be creating a new uh
229:49 - document inside of the collection with
229:51 - the DB post or we could literally pass
229:53 - in request body inside of here Buton
229:55 - yeah and if there is an error we want to
229:58 - set the response status to 500 which
230:01 - means internal server error that means
230:04 - something's went wrong or else you want
230:07 - to go ahead and set it to one which
230:10 - means
230:11 - created that means it was successfully
230:13 - created and everything is up and running
230:15 - and good um so yeah that's pretty much
230:19 - the uploading uh
230:23 - procedure and yeah actually let's go
230:25 - ahead and stretch everybody because
230:28 - let's let's get the energy High guys I
230:30 - know it's been it's been a while but you
230:32 - know sometimes you need to stretch a
230:33 - little bit so that your mind can work
230:35 - even a little bit more exactly yeah yeah
230:38 - yeah
230:40 - H we've been live about four hours
230:44 - almost 3 hours and 50 minutes thank you
230:46 - for the 100 concurrent viewers that we
230:47 - have right now it's actually about 200
230:51 - if we're counting Facebook but 100 on on
230:53 - YouTube thank you guys for sticking out
230:55 - this is this is NI that's so awesome
230:58 - thanks a lot guys yep thank you guys
231:02 - yeah
231:05 - okay nice perfect um
231:10 - so what we want to do now is
231:14 - actually uh retrieve all the data that
231:18 - we have inside of here okay so how do we
231:22 - do that so we need to draw a bit of a
231:25 - process
231:27 - here so I think yeah this is how I open
231:30 - up the uh whiteboard so what you want to
231:33 - do is basically save the
231:37 - image then
231:40 - uh save the post with the
231:45 - uh
231:48 - whoops with image
231:51 - name
231:54 - and oh
231:57 - damn okay save
232:00 - image then save
232:02 - post with image name this is necessary
232:07 - because you can only r retrieve the
232:09 - image if you literally uh adding the um
232:15 - name of the image at the end of the
232:17 - endpoint right so we will be
232:22 - retrieving the post first and grab the
232:26 - image name and then
232:29 - retrieve
232:31 - uh the image uh the image itself so was
232:37 - it kind of followable uh uh Frankie
232:39 - could you understand it so you retrieve
232:42 - the post you retrieve the image of the
232:44 - post and then you retrieve the name of
232:48 - what is it the text the the actual post
232:50 - or the image uh no so actually how so we
232:55 - need to filter
232:57 - down okay so because we are saving the
232:59 - posts and the uh the images into two
233:02 - different collections we have to keep
233:04 - track of which image goes with which
233:07 - post right so that's why we need to save
233:11 - the name next to the post so that we
233:15 - will be able to uh filter uh using the
233:18 - name right so first we get back all the
233:22 - posts and we go over them one by one
233:26 - check out which image go uh uh goes to
233:29 - which post and then retrieve those
233:32 - images one by one and snap it next to
233:35 - the post when we are rendering it out
233:37 - does it make sense I I see yes okay
233:40 - perfect aw
233:42 - awesome so what we will be doing
233:45 - now is first let's create the uh post
233:49 - retrieving endpoint which is going to be
233:52 - app.get right I'm going to scroll down a
233:56 - bit uh and we will be saying a
234:00 - retrieve and
234:03 - post and
234:06 - oops and we will of course request
234:09 - response as
234:13 - always and here what we want to do is
234:16 - first get everything back from the uh
234:19 - database and second sort everything
234:24 - uh in a descending
234:27 - order um based on the date right or or
234:31 - the actual time stamp and then throw it
234:32 - back to the front end and that will do
234:35 - uh the conversion and all those kind of
234:37 - stuff so what you want to do do is [ __ ]
234:40 - post uh
234:42 - find and because we're not adding any
234:45 - kind of filtering inside of here so we
234:48 - could literally add filters in here but
234:50 - we're not doing that because we want
234:52 - everything to be sent back so if there's
234:56 - an error uh we're going to make the call
234:59 - fail and if there's data then here we go
235:03 - so if error let's handle that
235:07 - oh error
235:10 - um let's set the
235:12 - res oops response uh status to
235:18 - 500 and send back the error so that we
235:21 - will be able to debug what's
235:24 - up uh
235:26 - nice else and this is uh where the
235:30 - interesting part comes
235:33 - in we will need to sort the data and
235:37 - this is literally snipp of code that I
235:40 - found on the internet today so we will
235:43 - need to sort the
235:45 - data based on the time stamp
235:49 - right so that's uh kind of it so it's
235:52 - funny because the time stamp is it's
235:54 - kind of like a string right exactly
235:57 - that's how it looks in the back end but
235:58 - once it's converted like you said to the
236:00 - front end then you can actually see what
236:02 - is the UTC time zone that we
236:05 - chose exactly actually it kind of knows
236:09 - kind of knows the difference between
236:11 - where you're
236:12 - at yeah like like the time stamp so even
236:16 - if it's string it still knows the
236:19 - difference yeah which one is bigger and
236:21 - which one's not I don't know
236:23 - how I mean literally I got this code
236:26 - from uh got this nippet from the
236:28 - internet actually I think we will be
236:31 - doing uh a couple of twitch sessions
236:34 - when we are like preparing and then I
236:36 - can like share you all these insights
236:38 - like how I go on internet find stuff how
236:41 - I debug and all the all the stuff that
236:44 - you actually see here but it's going to
236:46 - be official that I'm that I'm preparing
236:49 - right it's actually pretty cool man yeah
236:50 - I've heard a lot of people wanting to
236:52 - know you know the whole workflow of how
236:54 - we make these projects kind of like
236:56 - exactly how they are all organized and
236:59 - really like you said the resources that
237:01 - you use to build them so that's awesome
237:04 - exactly exactly like guys actually if
237:06 - you like the idea drop a comment and let
237:09 - us know because then we can show it to
237:11 - kazy and then we can just fire the
237:13 - project up ASAP yep drop a coming guys
237:17 - we're excited for that exactly yeah yeah
237:20 - I'm
237:22 - pumped and what you want to do now uh is
237:27 - literally uh create the filter um
237:32 - filtering endpoint that will just throw
237:35 - back the
237:36 - image uh to the front it
237:40 - right okay so what we will be doing is
237:43 - saying
237:46 - app.get and let's say
237:49 - retrieve um it's going to be
237:52 - images
237:54 - and and single because we are uh
237:57 - retrieving a single image and don't
237:59 - forget to add the quod Mark around
238:02 - it um and we will also have of course
238:06 - have a request and the response in the
238:08 - cobc function and inside of here what we
238:13 - will be firing off is the gridfs
238:16 - find one
238:20 - function oh no it's going to be the G
238:23 - the
238:24 - files because inside of files that's
238:26 - where we want to find
238:28 - one find one file that will uh that
238:33 - actually has the file
238:36 - name uh so remember uh when we created
238:40 - it this is what we are searching
238:43 - for so the file
238:46 - name is
238:49 - um is equals the request.
238:54 - query do name now I know this is already
238:57 - getting like crazy I will show it I will
239:01 - demo it right after uh I've built this
239:04 - part okay so if there's an error handle
239:07 - it if we get file that's cool uh and
239:11 - let's actually go ahead and do the error
239:14 - handling as usual so response status 500
239:20 - nice and send error
239:23 - perfect and else
239:27 - boom
239:29 - so else we want to check if the file is
239:33 - actually the file that we want so if
239:36 - it's like an actual file so if there's
239:38 - no file or something um or the file
239:41 - length is zero we just want to go ahead
239:45 - and say 404 and file not found
239:50 - however if we found the file we will
239:54 - create a read stream which is
239:56 - essentially like reading the file out of
239:59 - the rast
240:00 - storage
240:03 - and we will go ahead and grab the file
240:09 - and like like just push it back what's
240:12 - happening here let's go ahead and find
240:13 - it out so now that we have it inside of
240:18 - here uh let's actually go ahead and
240:20 - create a new one uh Rich which is going
240:23 - to be retrieve images and
240:27 - single
240:29 - and what was that query once again so
240:31 - that's going to be name and that's where
240:34 - I want to put the uh the file name right
240:40 - so I'm expecting to see the pwj
240:43 - logo
240:45 - um when I hit
240:50 - return
240:52 - and oops here we go oh wow nice so this
240:56 - is literally pushing the file back so we
241:00 - will actually be calling this link
241:03 - inside of uh the post file right
241:10 - okay so with that
241:14 - done um for now we are done with the
241:18 - back end let's go back and let's
241:22 - actually Implement what we have just
241:24 - done but first let's actually deploy
241:27 - this stuff so that we don't have to
241:29 - worry about like Local Host and not
241:30 - Local Host and all those kind of
241:32 - stuff so let's go to hu.com
241:37 - and and I don't know yeah I I have I
241:41 - have enough stuff okay um so inside of
241:45 - here I'll just say Facebook M um
241:50 - clone and live nice okay create uh you
241:56 - can do it just uh just that
241:58 - simple and I've already logged into my
242:01 - heru CLI if you haven't or you don't
242:04 - know what this is I recommend going uh
242:06 - onto this uh wo
242:09 - onto this page and whatever you
242:13 - got
242:15 - um even if you have a Windows or Mac I
242:19 - uh oops not this one I recommend
242:23 - installing the CLI this way uh not with
242:28 - any of the fancy Stu up here because uh
242:31 - I think it's a lot better and once
242:33 - you're done you're just going to go
242:35 - ahead log in the CLI CD inter your
242:37 - project initialize a git repository but
242:39 - because we have done that I'm just going
242:41 - to copy this
242:43 - part and actually create go back in here
242:49 - and set the uh remote
242:52 - git right so this is what I've uh pasted
242:56 - in here and it's done
243:02 - and what we got here
243:04 - is uh yeah so literally just copy paste
243:07 - all stuff next up we will do a g commit
243:11 - so get add do nice so we will see get
243:16 - status um all these files changed and
243:19 - actually
243:20 - added and we will be committing so get
243:25 - uh-
243:26 - am and we will say um almost
243:31 - done and perfect and notice that all the
243:36 - changes like all this stuff stuff like
243:38 - went back to
243:40 - White and what we will be doing now is
243:43 - basically say k
243:46 - push Heroku Master boom and that will
243:51 - essentially go ahead and push everything
243:52 - to Heroku
243:54 - hey yep first part of deployment
243:58 - dude that Des an air
244:02 - [Music]
244:04 - horn you love these horen you got to
244:07 - celebrate
244:09 - exactly and what I like to do is
244:12 - actually uh watch the herac logs as well
244:16 - you can just do that by typing a her/
244:19 - tail and once it says starting to up
244:23 - that's when you know things are
244:25 - ready
244:27 - so uh whoops this is three second yeah
244:31 - and this is the link that we have we can
244:36 - literally go ahead and go in here
244:39 - like got the hello world back like uh
244:42 - super easily nice and we can try it out
244:47 - with this uh part of the link as well
244:52 - like check it on uh right after it just
244:56 - uh remove the double
244:59 - slash and here we go so it works and now
245:02 - it's
245:04 - live it's
245:06 - crazy and and let's actually go back to
245:11 - where is yeah this is the front so let's
245:14 - actually close the back end for
245:22 - now just got a sale man let's get
245:25 - it hey nice beautiful perfect who do we
245:30 - welcome welcome Ceno sorry it's Carol
245:35 - that was the email so Carol asedo
245:37 - welcome welcome to the community thank
245:39 - you so much for joining really
245:40 - appreciate hey welcome
245:44 - welcome nice
245:46 - so what we kind of want to do is go
245:50 - ahead and inside of the front
245:52 - end you oops uh inside of actually the
245:56 - source you want to go ahead and create
245:57 - an xjs
246:00 - file and before we go any further you
246:03 - need to
246:06 - install a
246:08 - dependency which will
246:11 - be uh the AOS of course so mpm install
246:16 - xos and hopefully it's going to be
246:21 - fast so axios is literally letting you
246:24 - to make like rest requests pretty much
246:29 - let's actually go ahead and type your
246:31 - import xos
246:33 - from axios
246:36 - nice and and what we will be doing
246:40 - is create um an instance right so we
246:45 - will be just simply creating an instance
246:48 - which will be yeah so x.
246:52 - create and inside of here we will add
246:55 - the base URL which we have just created
246:59 - which is going to be this
247:02 - one
247:05 - and and let's remove the Slash from the
247:08 - end nice and
247:11 - oops um we will just go ahead and Export
247:15 - default the
247:17 - instance
247:19 - boom so now we have our axal instance
247:22 - done uh let's go ahead and so what are
247:27 - we doing here exactly we're so exactly
247:31 - um axios is it's kind of like fetch okay
247:35 - right so fetch is lit
247:38 - making uh requests to
247:41 - API
247:43 - um but
247:45 - because I mean fetch is like the more
247:48 - beginner stuff we want to go with axios
247:51 - and axios is like a more professional uh
247:54 - thing
247:55 - literally and we are just setting the
247:58 - base URL and outside of here we will say
248:02 - something like
248:03 - A.G which is literally mean which
248:06 - literally means that we we want to
248:07 - trigger this
248:09 - instance and let's go with a get uh
248:12 - function and the endpoint is going to be
248:15 - uh upload slash
248:18 - image and that way with just this line
248:21 - of code and a couple uh more like when
248:24 - we actually add the image but just this
248:26 - line of code we can uh literally Poe the
248:29 - image up to the database and with
248:33 - otherwise with
248:35 - fetch you would need to uh go go with
248:37 - the whole uh whole. link slash upload uh
248:44 - image and then you will need to uh say
248:51 - like this is like the body and all those
248:54 - kind of stuff so it's just uh making the
248:57 - whole thing like into one little
248:58 - instance and then we can just reuse this
249:00 - stuff
249:02 - again okay feed let's go to
249:06 - feed um
249:09 - hold
249:10 - on so inside the feed um yo David just
249:14 - as a because kind of an as an
249:16 - approximation how much do you think we
249:18 - have left off of this build in hours or
249:20 - time um I mean we could make it fast
249:24 - because kind of like all this knowledge
249:27 - uh so using axios using all this stuff
249:30 - is actually up uh in here and we are
249:33 - pretty much just reusing stuff so we
249:35 - could actually say that uh um from now
249:38 - on it could be a
249:41 - homework um and just wrap it up right
249:44 - here because the new new part is
249:48 - literally uh inside of
249:54 - server. is uh saving the image which is
249:57 - already covered everything else can be
249:59 - done uh using a couple of
250:02 - videos with the uh with the m builds so
250:07 - if if if we need to wrap it up fast we
250:09 - can go ahead and do it now yeah actually
250:12 - cuz we are a little bit time sensitive
250:15 - today we are getting few things built
250:17 - here in this studio we're going to get
250:18 - the TV mount and everything but we'll
250:21 - make sure you guys get the whole
250:23 - knowledge that we are you know teaching
250:25 - you guys and as David said we're going
250:27 - to leave a little bit of homework for
250:28 - you guys it's pretty much what we've
250:30 - shown
250:31 - you yeah yeah exactly so we may we
250:35 - literally uh showed you the new stuff
250:38 - you can now just go ahead and reuse
250:41 - everything that is in here and
250:43 - everything is going to be
250:46 - working okay I think we can go ahead and
250:49 - wrap it up here
250:51 - then and um you can make the
250:53 - improvements on the studio and oh my God
250:56 - it's almost 5:00 p.m
250:59 - y cool so you want to continue this
251:01 - build in another live is that the plan
251:04 - what's what's better I mean can that
251:07 - part as well or we could do the whole
251:11 - thing once again
251:14 - um without the glitches and all those
251:16 - kind of stuff okay we will figure it out
251:19 - later let's actually wrap it up for now
251:21 - awesome I think and then uh we will
251:24 - figure it out how we will be sharing all
251:26 - the knowledge beautiful okay so let's
251:29 - wrap it up today um that that's a lot of
251:32 - work that we did today connecting the
251:33 - back end the front end all the front end
251:35 - functionalities are there guys David did
251:38 - a great great job doing that explaining
251:40 - that and we also ran into a lot of
251:42 - technical issues actually which just
251:44 - makes us better at coding it just makes
251:47 - it a little bit more flavorful you know
251:49 - sometimes things don't go as expected so
251:52 - this is just part of life man but but
251:54 - it's cool anything that you want to
251:56 - share before or you want to explain
251:57 - before so that it's easier for them to
251:59 - have this build up to this
252:01 - point I think um guys literally like
252:06 - whenever we
252:07 - uh added like hardcoded data you just
252:12 - want to go ahead and uh and snap it out
252:16 - and change it with some kind of axio
252:19 - schol or you can use fatch if you want
252:20 - if you're more comfortable with
252:23 - that um and other than that that's kind
252:26 - of it awesome I think it it can be uh
252:30 - done with any other uh with with the
252:33 - help of other videos cool yep we'll
252:35 - continue this build on another video
252:37 - this week guys let's show them the the
252:40 - finished
252:41 - demo yeah okay so the finished
252:45 - demo is literally this thing and what
252:50 - what I want you guys to do is like hook
252:52 - up this
252:54 - button uh to the uploading functionality
252:57 - first save the image retrieve uh and you
253:01 - will get back all the data because we
253:03 - have already done that check out the um
253:08 - uh file name uh save it somewhere and
253:12 - then go ahead and make a post uh with
253:15 - this stuff going on in
253:17 - here and then save it to the uh to the
253:21 - other collection and once that's done I
253:24 - want you to go ahead and fire off a
253:25 - pusher that will uh refresh the whole uh
253:29 - feed inside of here and then
253:33 - also uh what I want you to do is is uh
253:38 - is like literally uh make the make the
253:41 - post uh make every post like render out
253:45 - like this nicely and inside of post I
253:48 - want you to pass in the image
253:51 - name and make the uh make it as the uh
253:55 - make this thing as the source so that so
253:58 - the link that you will be building up
254:01 - with the base URL and the image name I
254:03 - want that to be made uh made this source
254:08 - that's kind of pretty much the steps
254:10 - from now on pretty much it nice
254:12 - beautiful beautiful all righty guys
254:14 - thank you so much for following this
254:16 - build this was long man it was long 4
254:19 - hours wow we're tired you're tired more
254:22 - tired than I for sure but you know it's
254:25 - it's uh we're building up that stamina
254:27 - that coding stamina if you guys did get
254:29 - any value from this build make sure to
254:31 - click the link in the description below
254:33 - we got a free training for you where
254:34 - kazy teaches you how to become a
254:37 - profitable JavaScript developer as well
254:39 - as building up those those technical
254:41 - skills so that you can get your first
254:43 - job get your first client even just make
254:45 - money with JavaScript in general so link
254:48 - is in the description below it's a free
254:49 - training register now before we don't
254:52 - offer it anymore and going to be
254:54 - learning good
254:55 - things thank you so much guys so that
254:58 - was the Facebook app yeah and and David
255:01 - David is an amazing developer and you
255:04 - know he has a lot of passion to show you
255:06 - guys you know everything that he learned
255:08 - during these months it's amazing to see
255:10 - his growth and and learning and now
255:12 - teaching you guys so anything you want
255:14 - to finish off with
255:15 - David I think you pretty much said
255:17 - everything I'm going to go to bed hey
255:21 - yeah man have some sleep
255:24 - yeah uh I think I'll upload the finished
255:28 - code to GitHub and then just post it in
255:31 - uh on this Facebook build and then guys
255:34 - you can just go ahead and check it out
255:35 - for yourself I think going live again
255:37 - with it um will be a bit uh a bit of a
255:40 - friction but yeah we will figure that
255:42 - out I'll just post it post the GitHub
255:44 - links inside of here awesome check the
255:46 - links in the description below guys
255:48 - we'll be showing you the finalized
255:50 - project as well so stay tuned and thank

255:57 - video exactly peace guys peace everybody
256:00 - much love bye-bye

Cleaned transcript:

guys how's it going Frankie here haven't been here in a while and today I'm here with my friend hey how's it going everybody I'm David uh or people call me Dr M and what are we going to be building today Frankie yo today we're going to teach them how to build Facebook clone with the mer stack so this is the app that you guys are going to build and David and I are going to show you I'm going to ask a few questions um pretty much a begin in coding hopefully I can bring light to you guys and ask David a few questions so as you can see we have Google authentication right here to sign in and I'm going to go ahead and sign in after that we can see all of this so what are we seeing on screen David so we see on the screen uh firstly the stories of course and then you can actually go ahead and like add a new post yep like if I go ahead and like type in Yo and hit the return it should update automatically because this thing is actually real time awesome yeah I saw you post it I just posted one too exctly let's see seems like it takes a little bit of time right mhm what do you mean it takes a little oh no it's it's right there I don't see mine let's see so I'll do yo and then what I'm going to do is type in yo what's up and then you can also add an image to it and then click enter so in the demonstration here guys apparently I can't see it refresh let me actually just reload the whole page because this is what you guys are going to be building right so there's three columns to it after you sign in with your actual Google account you should be loog prompt into this you you log in with your Google account once you're inside you can see what I was just posting so it's yo yo so it takes a little bit of time just cu the database has to be refreshed that one was a little bit faster so I typed in yo what's up people and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to add an image to it and I drag it there let's see how it appears boom so now you can see that I put the image and I'm like what's up people a little bit of a typo here so what are these three columns David this is kind of like um navigation we have a sidebar on the left with all the buttons from the actual Facebook and then in the middle we have the whole feed with all the posts and on the right hand side we have like an actual Facebook uh MB right yes on the right side so nice awesome so you want to you want to go into the build you want to show them how to build this so let's go let's do it awesome man so what I'm going to do then uh I think I think our live chat just disconnected again okay um left the collaboration session I see it here so yeah I think I'm I'm reconnecting at the moment all right let me know once you're connected so we can start showing the people how this is done what is up everybody I see panu here panu is like same what's up panu panu is a 13yearold student for profitable shortcut and he's an awesome part of this community see aara here as well thara is awesome as well he's one of the most active members right now as of recently so we love the community very very much guys if you have any questions also just drop them in the chat below and you know make sure to ask actually intelligent questions that people can get value from and from there we'll move on so David have you been able to connect to the live share nope it says you're offline so what I'm going to do is I'm going to get I'm going to send you a new link okay so okay here you go let me know once you're ready with that and still says you're off yeah Coy here so this is the build guys if I understand correctly this right column is made out of an iframe right so this is actually is correct perfect yeah and so this is actually connected to our real Facebook page clever program hey Su kakar already dropped an image oh my God they dropped an image oh yeah yeah they went into it guys let's try to keep it clean you know this is learning environment after all and you know we want everybody to learn we want everything to be pretty much PG you know so everybody can see so were you able to connect to the live show David it still says you're offline uh I don't know what's going on uh can you fix something on on on on your end uh is the connection good let me see so I got a red Little Dot here I don't know if this is anything change status no it it's not not not the thing um um I think um you send me a new link okay so I got a new link here let me share it with you on Skype here we go sorry for the technical difficulties guys stick with us you guys are going to learn how to build Facebook with the M Stack this is you know this is part of being a developer guys you know sometimes you need to have your environment ready and sometimes it gives you a little bit of problems but it's just a reflection of what goes on in the real world exactly like this couldn't get any more Reed that's what I always say exactly exactly problems are are part of our Lives okay now I'm connecting I'm joining the collab session awesome awesome so I'm going to go ahead and play a little bit more with the with the actual demo demo is awesome so one of the things that I like the most off the bat it's the way that it's organized right so you guys can see here all of these little icons I believe these were made with materialized right materialized yeah everything is uh actually let's talk a little bit about uh the stack that we will be using so for the front end we are using react as you uh as you know but um we also use material UI for all the icons up there and we are using uh material UI input uh when we are uh uploading files and we also will be using the react context API which is uh kind of new for me too so I'll try to explain it the best I can uh but if something is not clear I highly recommend everybody goes ahead and watches uh Sun's video because he is the react master of our team um but we will be using react context API and then let's turn to the back end so on the back end as you already know we will be using mongod DB we will be using expressjs and nodejs and we will also be using something called The Grid FS of uh mongod DB and grid FS actually will allow us to upload images to mongod DB Direct directly so until up until this time we were using uh Firebase to upload images and then we used the links that Firebase generated but this time we will take it another level deeper and we will be using um mongod DB completely for uh storing every single thing right I I remember this is this was a highly requested um highly requested feature to do so we here you guys we are building it for you today um once I'll be able to join the collab session progress here disconnection um I'm not in there um let's go and let's try to something on the connection part is not working out some people are saying that my voice is low is it low guys let me see I'm going to move it a little bit up so hopefully this sounds a little bit better maybe inside wrong editor window somebody saying okay so for some reason the live share doesn't seem to be working um maybe we can start it from scratch yeah yeah let's do it let's let's start it from scratch oh hold on it just uh loaded for me now WIS code is opening at the moment and let's hope it sets up great and and we will be able to start the build awesome I see that you joined okay now I'm following you awesome yo back in the game guys this is how we do it exactly so you guys already saw what we're going to build it looks pretty freaking fun make sure to stick around you guys are going to be building this the Facebook clone with a M Stack ey frame over here the stories over here we're going to be using mongod DB and as you were saying David what is the M Stack contain what does it mean so M Stack is made out of mongod DB expressjs reactjs and um no JS sorry I had to think a little okay let me see I'm going write that down so the bur stack pretty much consists of mongod DB that's right and then it also I'm going to actually Express JS so Express whoops okay during that time I'll start deleting all these files and so we can start the build thenb then it's also expressjs Express JS then it's also Redux what's the r on the mer no re uh react react it is react react reactjs and nodejs is the last one and nodejs so all of these things are going to be things that we're going to be using today all of these Technologies and so that pretty much is the mer stack it is one of the most used and popular stacks for for actual what's it called web development right now so David I wasn't following you now I'm following you soing out the space for everybody okay uh now I'll try to delete all these files and actually start typing in the terminal are you sharing the terminal too let me see so share terminal so sh terminal there's one and then I click bash yeah read and right uh it should be good okay um I don't see let's actually not mess around with the terminal if you can go ahead and type in npx create react app uh create D react D app and like name it Facebook M um oh oops I how did I click enter so after the okay okay so it will be named my react app uh it's all good so you left the collaboration session apparently oh damn I don't know why it's actually um busting you out of the communication let's see so Bon text says happy birthday Sunny didn't get a chance to wish you hey awesome and then we see here so Sunny saying command shift p Frankie and then type in share terminal command shift p type in share terminal here we go okay so now I can join the session again it might happen that you will be typing the whole thing hey sounds fun um let me see so were you able to to go into the session should I invite you again um I think something on the connection side on your end is is not working out okay worst case scenario I'll be I'll be saying what to type and then you can go ahead and like uh do the whole thing sounds good let's get you on the screen though CU if not that's going to take us a little bit longer people are going to get a little bit impatient but if not guys we got it all handled you know like I said before this is all part of the coding environment sometimes you run into to problems but it's you know what makes you stick through those problems that gives you that skill gives you that you know that actual that actual will to keep on coding and keep on getting better with your skills so right now we're just waiting for David to go into the shared session for the code and we're about to code this Facebook app for you guys right so like I shared with you guys the already like three times we have some people here that are jumping in and they're actually dropping in a a little bit of posts and somebody's asking will you guys share the code at the end yes we will be sharing the code at the end yes we will we will share the code but first the good thing will be would be if I could join the collab session so I sent you another another invitation let's see okay let's try that one which again says the host is seems to host seems to be offline uh which is strange um okay um let's do the other way let's do the firework uh firefighting I'll be dropping the code piece by piece um in slack and then you can go ahead and add the add those stuff into uh the build right cool yeah we can start like that right now I'm actually having I'm actually having a f FaceTime with sunny what's up Sunny say hi to everybody man yo Sunny command shift p let's get it done cation session and collaboration session I I can't see it so command shift command shift P start new I don't I don't see it new collaboration no I don't see it let me go ahe you see ahead know command Q okay so I'm GNA open it up again done you open again start cation session so command shift p start elaboration session okay I see it now and Live share. start got it y stop and this usually restarts everything okay now I think you can drop it in in the chat and we can finally finally finally wait so I did click I did start collaboration session now should I invite David again yeah okay we go David should be the new link okay okay vs code is setting up guys we might be able to start it right now let's get it okay so seems like it's loading up bosi has joined awesome nice perfect okay so I'll start testing it by starting to delete all the files and it seems like that we it is working okay now if you could share your terminal with me I share the server you said Sunny okay and what do I put enter the TCP Port 3000 3,000 okay Enter done enter enter and then share terminal command shift p share terminal yeah and then read and write awesome got it and then you guys should be good to go yep and apparently I am following you David right yeah permission to I just yeah make make it read and right and okay focus terminal boom boom Sunny for you guys saving the day let's get it and whoa we just got a donation Sunny 28 Canadian dollars oh my God thank you Alexander thank you guys so now we're going to jump into the build thank you Sunny for helping us troubleshoot this Cod man and appreciate you byebye okay now we should be able to start okay so I'm going to start uh building the app by typing in uh into the terminal MPX create react app and I'll be naming it uh Facebook so I'm actually not seeing you I'm not seeing what you're doing says deleted deleted let me see you're in another JS right uh no I've I've already deleted that cuz I don't see I can't see what you're doing seems weird so I'm only seeing deleted ones and I see you on the another. JS h okay I just created a yo. JS yeah I see you okay nice okay and can you see me in the terminal I'm in I'm in terminal one zsh terminal one okay I see you now let's see okay awesome awesome okay so I'll go ahead and delete yo. JS cuz we don't need that that was just for testing purposes and now as in the terminal I will uh start creating the react app now guys thanks you so much if you stick with us and and you're here with us now uh it finally looks like that we were able to troubleshoot every single thing because we had issues with audio we had issues with connection we had issues with live share but now it's all set and that deserves an air horn I believe exactly love that nice let's jump into okay yeah let's jump in okay so we will be starting uh up the we will be starting building the app with the front end so let's actually everybody go ahead and create a react app with the good old MPX create react app um command and I'll be calling the project name uh Facebook react and I think that's a pretty good name and I'll just go ahead and like hit return now it's going to take a little bit of time while it loads uh but don't worry this will do everything for us now uh on the left hand side you can see that it's already creating a folder with the package.json file and yeah um so on the front end we will be using like I said react we will be using react context API we will be using uh material UI and we will build the whole thing with lots of components um so while actually that is loading yo what's up with the phone Instagram stories let's go Facebook live hey what's up so I think you can go ahead and and open up a browser and start setting up our database so if you could go ahead and open up Chrome and share it with everybody um so let's go to mongodb domcom because we will be using mongodb right so mongod db.com is the thing yeah and I have no clue if if you guys have a have an account or not but in the middle there is a start here button you can uh go ahead and easily sign up right there um and it's actually a free nosql database service that we are going to be using so Frankie you want to go ahead and set up mongodb so how do we go ahead and do that just give me direction let's go and let's go and just uh hit the middle button uh the start here button uh right in the middle of the screen it yep that's the one and you can go with Google sign in that's going to be the easiest way to go about it and select whatever account you want to go with and okay now it's going to take a little time yeah just accept everything thing and submit guys this is literally the process of signing up to mongod DV so if you haven't already this is how it looks like and this is a stepbystep uh guide on how to go ahead and start up with your first very first mongod DB database right so up here it shows like uh let's get your account set up you just want to go ahead and uh click JavaScript down there there and just go with the green button uh on the bottom right hand side uh and you want to go with the create free cluster and that is what we will be using so there is nothing to set up here uh you can leave everything just the way it is now and you can just go ahead and uh create the cluster awesome this is awesome if you guys are barely starting out you can see the whole process from the beginning so right now we're setting up mongod DB exactly exactly um okay uh B yeah and oh I think I think I I think we see saw everything okay okay for some reason the great react app um just failed uh okay so now it's going to uh take a little while while it loads up uh so mongodb is pretty much what is it the database right so yeah exactly it's it's like a it's a no SQL database right so something like firee exactly so this is a no SQL database we are not going to be using any kind of uh SQL stuff like normally you would use with uh with of course SQL uh it's a lot more easier to set up and and it's a lot easier to work with uh in my opinion and for beginners I think it's um it's a it's a great way to start uh working with databases right what's your what's your take on on that to be honest the only experience that I have with these nosql databases is Firebase and you know I like it a lot just because it's it's very real time so it doesn't you know everybody can use it it's free you know for most personal projects it's free and it's a good combination to use with react but today you know we wanted to switch it up a bit for you guys and actually teach you guys how to use the mer stack and so you know exactly actually we will be making mongod DB real time as well so that's if if uh if you're pumped about that just drop some love in the comment section or something drop a fire Emoji if you're pumped about um making the mango DB uh real time and actually at the at this time um the create react app is running and I think it should be done in any minute and hopefully it will be very soon so this is still running right here so we're just waiting for that as well exactly yeah yeah so right now what is it doing is it connecting between these two nope uh so on mango mongod DB is currently building the cluster where uh all the where we will be so it's basically setting up a server to run our database uh and great rack app is like going a totally other way uh it's just creating uh a front and application for us other than that uh so these are not connecting at the moment um but yeah we will be connecting them very soon two different processes going on at the same time oh your computer is sing too a I see I see okay uh now it's installing all the note packages as far as I can see yeah okay by the time so actually uh the cluster got set up so you can go back to mongod DB and let's actually set the whole thing up so on the left hand side there is a network access uh button you can go ahead and click that says network access on the left hand side yeah in the in the nav bar here we go yeah so you want to click network access and just go ahead and add an IP address and it will pop up a little screen but just go ahead and hit allow access from anywhere uh it's up yeah that's the one and if it's 0000 Z that's good just go ahead and confirm that and loading up pending that's cool that's good and you can go on the database access as well now my connection is lost again to the live share yeah live share and it says the same thing uh the host host of the workspace seems to be offline which is uh qu so let's let's set this up first and then I'll go ahead and just redo the same process okay so let's go and just uh add a new database user and then you can just type in admin uh right there exactly and like create autogenerate a cql password that's uh yep and you want to go ahead and copy that and yeah and just save it somewhere save because this is the last time you will be able to do this and we will be using it uh once we want to to connect to uh mongod DB right so you want to have it uh somewhere safe and just go ahead and add the uh add add the user with the green button at the uh buttom yeah that's the one you want to click it's going to go ahead and create all the stuff now it's actually um creating the rule uh to creating the rule uh to be able to um connect the database from anywhere with that user MH and right now it's uh my vs code says I'm unable to connect to to the host so we got the database ready what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to X command Q out of it and I'm going to reop it so visual studio code and then wait up till it loads after we're in here what I'm going to do is I'm going to start a collaboration session command shift p and then start collaboration session that's right I'm starting it uh so youone need to sign in with GitHub sign in with GitHub let's go yeah and yeah I think you can use Club programmer that's cool and authorize and with the done okay cool was this computer reset by the way started maybe yeah MH I see okay uh now you should be able to uh drop me a link I'll drop you the new link let's drop it in chat for you so now what I'm doing is I'm inviting David to the collaboration session again apparently it seems like it cuts off after a little bit of a while of inactivity so we're about to join the same coding session and from there we're going to teach you guys how to build the Facebook merge stch so now we got the mongodb database set up right David exactly yeah right I see here that you just joined the collaboration session okay and I think I'm going to need uh read write access to the so I'm share server with you right no it popped up on the bottom right and you can go ahead and make the terminal read and right okay awesome okay uh Focus terminal it's not currently editing assured document says yeah um okay now for and also cre react app failed for some reason um so I see you now I'm following you now okay perfect I see that you wrote the names Facebook react or Dash that's a problem because that's not what happened no okay now the terminal oh okay so the terminal should be okay perfect so I'm going to go ahead and type type in mbx create react app Facebook M front and and let's go ahead and hit return okay now it's starting up the react project again because for some reason it just failed last time sorry guys for all the technical difficulties part of the journey exactly now you learn learn from our mistakes don't make these mistakes guys yeah so right now we're giving it a little bit of time for the react app to load yeah but like I mean everybody has now time to follow us and actually guys if you have any questions drop them in the chat and now is the time to answer some stuff I think yeah also guys if you guys are enjoying this content which we still haven't gotten into the meet make sure to follow us on Instagram IG David ri. JS he's dropping amazing content there for JavaScript and just I just want to say David you know your skills in in react and JavaScript and everything have been you know very refined uh you know throughout these few months it's it's amazing the skill level that you require yeah I I'll I tried my best to uh reach as as high as possible um so yeah but I mean it required crazy amount of work yeah right you can't there's no there's no such thing like a shortcut I mean there's no shortcut in coding you have to put in the work guys you have to put in the time you know it's all pretty much process of repetition and you know that's what's going to build your skill exactly I know David has been going live you know this past week with sunny creating crazy amounts of builds and now this is going to be a really really good one as well okay so now it says I have to agree uh the X code license agreement um space space yeah space space space lot of space okay uh so it's running I think it's needed for for the Git Version Control I see oh okay agreeing admin privileges okay uh we might need to um rerun the thing do you have xcode installed on the computer by the way xcode I mean I should but we need X code that's uh just to yeah just open it up uh I think I think it's because uh xcode was updated so just open it up and you need to agree all the licenses so everybody yeah go ahead and just agree and you will need like an admin password to agree there and guys if you are on Mac and you have xcode installed and it's updated uh then probably you will need to go through this process as well I've I've had to do it with both of my Macs and and yeah uh without that you are not able to create a g version controlled uh project so yeah by the time do we got any questions so why are we using xcode because xcode is used to make you know iOS development apps right so yeah so it's actually just because we are using MacBook and when you're using a Mac uh git is built into xcode and and the part of uh Apple's infrastructure and it was recently updated uh to I think I think xcode 12 is the new version so you can you know that you have the fresh version if the hammer on the icon is black so if it's still silver you don't have to worry about all this stuff uh you only have to worry about it if you have it uh have the hammer black right makes sense so we just need to do that and like yeah it's kind of like the Apple stuff yeah I've actually used X code before it's it's really good it's kind of a heavy IDE to use but to be honest with you compared to you know Android Studio which was what I was using before that man Android Studio is so heavy it's so exact yeah compared to Android Studio it's a simple ID yeah exactly Android Studio is just it's like coding in Java like you just need so so much yeah like actually there are a lot of memes where people like putting uh some meat on their computer when before opening Android Studio because it's going to uh heat up so much oh yeah meme time I'm guessing yeah let SP out something so this is still loading guys it's going to take a little bit of a time I see actually xed out of it let's see where it's at so now here we go so we're a little bit more than halfways done so yeah okay cool now let's let's respond to a few questions cuz I know you guys are very active right now know yeah exactly let me so hope continue the back end with Mongoose do we use Mong in this we will be using Mongol that is right we will be using Mongol and we will be using grid FS with um for for [ __ ] TB and the back end stuff awesome so okay let's see another question so Rak rukaya asks why functional components over class components um guess what man we got a $5 donation by tane Blake thank you so much that deserves an air horn let's get it awesome thank you so much to Dane appreciate you man you w to you want to answer that question what's it saying what's it saying uh let's first answer the question the first one okay so why not class classbased components first I'm not too confident with class based comp components that's the main reason probably but second of all actually functional components are are the future right clausebased components are outdated uh nobody is you like yeah there are lots of companies which are still using cloudbased components but they will be uh starting to trans uh transcode everything to functional uh we just I mean the world is changing everything is changing the way you code is changing and everything is moving towards to functional components right and it's much easier uh to learn and to master because I mean functional components are so much easier to write and with with classbased components that's what uh sunny and I are always laugh at that is the this keyword and you have to put it some random uh places and it's just not beginner friendly at all so we're just not not doing that uh up here I think we will be dropping a couple of contents on how to how to use that um but just later on all right uh let's see another one let's see the donation question danne Blake he donated $5 thank you so much man he asks thanks a lot hey let me actually take a picture of it so you guys can actually see this so he asks hey first time catching a live stream nice up welcome dude see if I can actually zoom into it so you guys can check it out mhm saying hey first time catching a live stream discover this channel couple days ago thanks for all the videos I'm learning a lot thank you so much man make sure to stick around bro cuz we're going heavy on the content this past month we were having a a conference meeting a little bit ago and we realized that we put out 100 videos on YouTube the last 3 months pretty much is almost every day dropping videos every day so you know that's that's our plan still we're going to continue doing that right now we're waiting for this the xcode to install its component so that we can proceed with the code but you know this is one of the builds that you guys are going to be building the Facebook mer stack build and it's actually the new Facebook UI right David that's correct that's correct we are not not going with the old stuff we are always going the with the newest stack and the newest stuff so yeah we normally try to see you know what what is the most popular thing in in the industry what type of you know market share you know each programming language has I know that right now the mer stack is really one of the most popular Stacks Tech stacks for web development and you know we're tackling all of the projects that we've made before with react and Firebase but now using the M Stack that is right that is right so okay it's almost finished installing it's almost like what 80% nice nice awesome awesome so let's take a few questions as that is loading so somebody asks Mr H asks hey guys do you have any resources to learn how to catch a Donley uh what never mind a I don't know what that is if anybody knows what that is drop it in the comments below he will please explain what's that uh I see the last one is tagging me yeah David could you please explain how to update the active status of the context on Real Time basis so the active status of okay can you like make it like huge then we'll make it big okay could you please explain how do you update the AC status of status contacts on a real time basis um I don't think I catch the question the essence of what you're trying to ask but we will be using the react context API and we will be uh shooting into it every single time when the uh application reloads and we will be adding the new uh signed in person but because react actually has like a shortterm memory whenever you refresh it will be wiped out and you will need to sign in again and that is the thing uh that is the user that we will be adding to the context API I hope it answered your question by the way awesome then aara says maybe you could use sockets are we using soet we could we could use sockets but that's a lot of headache to set up so we we we will be using uh Pusher to make [ __ ] DB real time okay MX create um now I'm just testing out if it's working in the background make sure I have that so that everybody can see npx createreactapp yeah I'm just trying to create the app again and delete the other one that was uh that stopped uh there and FAL asks can you please save the stream when you guys are done yes so all of these streams are going to be uploaded to our YouTube channel if you guys want to see it you know on your own time you can just always go back to it and you know make sure to leave a comment if you guys are getting any you know good things to learn from it also you know the love that you guys bring to us you know we love this community it's insane really just drives us to to build more and more projects right David exactly that's right that's right okay um now it's loading I think we will cut this part out uh from the uploaded version mhm just so we can save you guys a little bit of time yeah exactly if somebody wants to rewatch it uh you can just watch the watch the uh cut version so right now um so right now what are we doing is it's we're working on what specifically so we are creating another react app uh with the accepted stuff uh so we are setting up the front end at the moment okay so I'm going to put that so that people can see setting up front end and awesome so we will be working on the look and fail of the app yeah uh you can actually X out that file that you're in at the moment um I'm creating a new one nice and you can accept that too okay I hope I really hope this time will be going cool and I think we accepted everything so we we should be good to go now seems like xode is finished running nice nice nice okay should I do something in it no no no we we don't need xcode anymore you can Comm Q out of it awesome got it so I'm here now now I'm in package.json exactly uh you can actually X Out uh we will not need that for now awesome um so now we are installing node so at the moment cool yep I see the terminal node install. js I see so let me know when I should follow you because when I click follow it takes me to package.json okay yeah okay sure sure oh yeah that was the last file I was I had open but okay aara asks are we using es6 Imports in nodejs yes we will be using es6 Imports uh we are trying to keep everything with the newest stuff and we try to teach you guys the newest Technologies so of course we will be using es6 in nodejs and guys I think we are good with setting things up because we we actually back uh pass that point and yeah we initialize git repository and we are installing the dependencies nice nice so we are getting there we are finally finally finally getting there so another question Raya again she seems very active right now she asks are you guys going to use react Contex API or Redux we will be using react react context API so if you're more interested in uh Redux you can go ahead and watch Sunny's uh yesterday's video yesterday's live yeah uh with sunny because Sunny was showing uh Redux on that video okay nice testing libraries all those stuff yeah and I I already see that we got more and more files so if if you can actually click the top left corner uh there is those file file icons yeah and just open up that folder so we H we are uh actually getting everything set up uh we got lots of files in here and that's good that's what we won yeah yush Pand says yeah very well explained yesterday yep a lot of people got a lot of value from that Redux video that Sunny dropped and it's actually I think it's sitting on like 15,000 views in one day so apparently a lot of people are watching it it's amazing thank you a hey we got the react app let's get it yep hey finally okay so guys when it says happy hacking that's when you know everything is on the everything is working cool okay so I'm just going to uh CD into the project CD into yeah uh into the react app with the terminal so I'm just going to go ahead and type in CD of V now I'm inside there and if you are using oh my Z Sage you may be able to see git and between the parand there's a master that means the git reposit is initialized so and and you're currently on the master wrench so I'll just go ahead and type in mpm start just to see uh if everything is working correctly and Frankie it will open up a new uh browser window if you could uh go ahead and share it with everybody that would be awesome uh so actually it starts up on Local Host 3000 unless you have um something open on that board right do opened yep uh awesome and can you refresh it it shouldn't be looking like this H it's strange oh nice that's the one that that's what we wanted to see so guys if you are at this point it's a good place to be that is where we will be start going off okay uh let's go back to vs code right now and let's actually do our cleanup process awesome should I follow you so now yeah now now you should be following me so I'll be showing around uh you guys and if you pass a command J we will close up the terminal and if you press a command B it will close up the left bar so we will have more uh space on the screen for the code and actually if you could uh put the uh running react app next to the code that would be awesome Okay cool so we got this here and then running react app here yeah that's awesome okay there we go so this is react app ex out of the terminal um press command j instead I don't know if it stops the terminal or not just okay awesome okay so I'll be um I'll be showing the um cleanup process so first thing first we need to delete uh the second line which is importing the logo then we will need to actually delete everything uh inside of the div and I just uh like to start up the project with a H1 and like say hello clever programmers and now I saved it it should be some it should be rerender the whole page on the right hand side on of uh Frankie screen we saw right now that it it made it had a little bit of an error when you started typing and then all of a sudden it's refresh right yeah let's let's do a refresh I think it should be good now L clev programmers nice that's the one that that's the thing we wanted to see okay now let's go back to WS code and press command B okay and let's show the F let's show them the files because currently we are deleting all the test files so there was an app. test.js file I've already went ahead and deleted that now I'm actually deleting the setup test.js file right so we do not need those files you can just go ahead and get rid of them and now I'm also deleting the logo.svg file and this is something that we call the cleanup process so now we can actually uh hide the left hand side uh pressing command B and now we have all the things ready okay so I'm just going to go ahead and like mask things out um so we're starting off doing the front end right exactly I'm just going to sketch out a couple of stuff so that we know what we will be building so the app actually consists of three main parts one of them will be the sidebar uh the next one will be the actual feed and the third one will be it's kind of like the widgets and actually we're getting short in time so I'll be running uh pass through it like pretty fast uh the front and stuff so that everybody is getting as much value as possible guys feel free to stop the video at any time and just uh go ahead and try to build it at your own base but I actually recommend everybody just watching it and then uh try out the whole thing again after the live right and now it's the time for you to ask questions uh Sunny if you can go ahead and uh pop me any questions and like stop me at any time that would be awesome awesome with that said let's jump straight into building it okay so we will actually first have a Heather uh which is not in the jotting down so I'll just uh pop in header right here uh nice and let's actually create a folder uh which you can do by opening up the left side with command B and there is up top there is a little uh button which you can hit and say uh like name name the new folder components which I'm doing right now so we have a new folder called components I think yeah it's it's right inside of source nice and I'm adding a header. JS file and as well as a a header uh. CSS so guys with the um throughout this build we will be using es7 Snippets it's actually a nice little extension um that you can download for free for vs code and it allows me to code very quickly so if I go ahead and type in R off R afce uh that will create a react Arrow function component and will export it right so it's literally the initials of these words so if you kind of like know what your uh what you want to build uh you can actually create like a react class based component I think which is RCC right so that's actually a classbased component but uh and what Sunny likes to use is a react uh functional component and but I I actually prefer rafc because that will create an error function uh which for some reason what's up what's an arrow function for those that don't know yeah exactly exactly that's the as6 standard okay with that done I have actually created the header. JS file and now is the time to open up the terminal once again and I will stop the application from running can you open up the terminal with the command J there we go okay perfect and now I'm going to go ahead and start uh start importing a couple of dependencies so first thing first I'll be importing um material UI so I'm just going to go ahead and type in mpm install uh at oh mpm install at Material uh UI oh um what's happening in the terminal oh okay so it's just uh bugging out for me mpmi at materialui uh is it oh okay I see I see okay and and slash call and I think now we should be good and it's installing right rolled back failed op okay now it's what's up seems like it's okay mhm okay so it's installing nice nice awesome awesome so let's see if somebody dropped a question that's worth answering somebody asks what is the extension name again so it's called es7 react Redux graph QA Snippets but if you start typing in es7 Snippets and maybe put react uh it will give you give it it to you uh as the first one right okay so that's that's like a super powerful tool it saves you crazy amount of time actually uh and you want to go with uh saving time okay now we got that installed but we also need to install um material UI icons so I'm just going to go ahead and use the exact same uh command and just delete call from the end and type in icons instead so we are getting that as well yeah material UI icons is one of the most popular icons right now right in the it's a it's a very powerful um what's it called CSS Library exactly exactly exactly it's super powerful and it takes you after to the next level actually yeah you can pretty much find everything there it's awesome exactly I also heard that bootstrap stopped using material UI oh yeah so they have their own icons now right going on yeah exactly I mean it's so much better than than bootstrap right okay uh now with that done what we want to do is we kind of want to have like a logo um oh and we also be using BM naming convention so if you don't know what that is I highly recommend going going ahead and uh Googling it up uh but we will be using uh the BM naming convention and inside of the first div we will just name it um we will name it header right so that's part of the b b naming convention okay next up we kind of want to have uh a a logo and we want to have another div which will contain this logo right so I'm just going going to I have a snippet here already so I just created a new div and I've searched up the Wikipedia uh Facebook logo add in an ALT text of Facebook logo and I should be able to see it uh on the app which is not running at the moment so I'm just going to go ahead and type in mpm start and it will fire up uh on uh on Frankie's screen um with that done let's actually go ahead and import that into our app.js file right so I'm just going to go and start typing in header and it will it will or will not show up okay so it's not showing up at the moment so I have to import it manually so I'm going to go ahead and type in up top import header from um components slash header right okay now we should be good to go and we should be seeing a Facebook logo soon on the right hand side you can actually go ahead and uh refresh Frankie there we go nice so it's small I mean it's a it's it's an awesome looking logo thanks Mark very big logo yeah okay um next up we want to add an input uh right under the header uh which will just contain like it's going to be like a simple uh text input and I'm actually removing the H1 we do not need it anymore so we have the Facebook logo we have the input right there and what you want to do is import uh the the search icon from Material UI icon and that will actually yeah search icon see Nikita asks a question where were where are we deploying our back end uh so we will be deploying our backend on Heroku using Heroku guys yeah exactly we will be using Heroku okay nice uh now it should be good and on the right hand side if you scroll down we should be able to see a input field somewhere with a search icon yep here we go on the bottom uh yeah if I think you need to move our uh faces like actually you can move move the uh move our profile pictures oh yeah nice so it's a small one let me see if you guys you guys can't see it anymore but I'll bring it down to the screen so it's going to be here in the bottom guys give me one second I'm going to try to make it bigger so you guys can actually see so I'm scrolling down and making it bigger so you guys can see I'm going to show you with a pointer nice the search is going to be here nice exactly perfect awesome okay so with that done um we kind of have the searching fun fun ality we ALS so if you go ahead and check out the new Facebook uh Facebook header uh there are a bunch of icons in the middle so we will be creating another Dev and we will be adding a new uh another other uh other amount of icons so what I've done is I've created a div with a class name of header Center ENT and I've created an another div with uh called header option uh and I've added the head option active um class name right and inside of there there is a home icon which we want to be large so I'm adding the font size large in there and we also want to have like a flag icon um the subscription outlined icon and all these are actually almost the exact same thing as uh what they are using uh at Facebook and we of course we need to import all these uh icons I'm actually going to go ahead and divide as I'm importing so we are importing home flag subscription outline storefront and supervised user right and with saving that uh down there it should be showing all the icons right right yep so now I can see if I scroll down all the way down I can see I'm going to move our images from here so you guys can actually see right here in the middle so all of these icons is what David is talking about let me actually make it a little bit bigger for you guys and then scroll and then point it out so right there these are going to be the icons pretty much you can see the the flag to Play Store all of those things yeah awesome okay next up we will be creating the right side of the header right so I'm just going to go ahead and like create a new uh div which will have a class name of header whoa whoa whoa header right um why isn't my M working hold down okay so I'm just going to go ahead and manually create a div which will have a class name of uh header ride and we will be adding a couple of other stuff in there too so we will have another div uh which will have the class name of header info so these are going to be essentially the icons that you see on the right hand side so it will have the drop down the uh the add icon and all those kind the notification and all those kind of stuff right okay uh and we will also be importing the Avatar which is going to contain the image of the user that is currently logged in right so we want that to be uh on the screen okay so I've just added the AAR which is Curr Curr not imported um but yeah and we also are going to be adding a H4 which will contain the name of the user who is actively logged in so I'm just going to say uh Frankie logged in cool let me let me see so this is what you're talking about pretty much right let me show the people uh we yeah on the right hand side of the to uh top bar you can actually full screen that exactly that's the thing that I'm talking about in the right top right so that's the Avatar the picture is the Avatar and then the H4 is the the username that's logged in exactly exactly and I've added and now we are going to be adding all those icons next to it right awesome that's what we're working on right now yeah but before that I'm going to import a couple of uh dependencies these are all from uh material UI you don't have to worry about these just uh go ahead and and import them as we speak and you will be able to um make this application work all right with that done uh I'm going to import um first the add icon right then Forum icon then we will be uh oops we will be adding the notification active and we also need this other one nice so with that uh so if you go ahead and Frankie if you check it out M let's see so I'm going to click refresh and just refresh and down there we should be seeing new newer icons so I'm going to go here and I'm going to go down so you guys can check it out again I'm going to move our image here it doesn't go that down but let me actually full screen it a little bit more so right there so those icons where you see Frankie is going to be the ones that we're just adding In This Moment exactly exactly and we've also imported something called icon button which will make which will add a nice little animation to these icons so I'll be wrapping all these icons into icon button right and that will if you scroll down a little in the code um yeah so I'm actually wrapping everything uh inside of these icon buttons and that will make the whole thing like have like a nice little squiggle or like this uh nice effect so if you go ahead and like try clicking those icons on the right hand side that would be awesome to like show off uh how it actually looks like so let me actually it up see oh damn so I'm sharing it on my other screen I just want you guys to see it you can like make the um make the top smaller uh okay yeah so now if we click these right it's what David is talking about yeah exactly behavor super dope okay so I think with that done we are done with heather. JS for now uh what we want to do is we want to actually style this so let's go and actually import up top the uh header the uh CSS file nice uh and with that let's actually go into header at CSS and nice so we will be we will be uh adding like a couple of styling stuff so first thing first uh the whole header needs to have display Flex right um something is header CSS cannot found header CSS oh I think I I think I know what I uh where I made a mistake I need to add this uh at the actual bath okay nice um so we we adding this display Flex We will be adding uh 15 pixels top and bottom and we are adding 20 pixels right and left hand side padding uh for the whole uh thing we will be using justify content space between to actually space uh things nicely out uh we are making the header stick to the uh stick to the top so we are using position sticky uh we are setting the background color to white the Zen index is going to be 100 top is going to be zero because we actually want this to snap to the uh top and we actually want to uh give it like a nice little box Shadow this will all make sense when we uh style everything out okay so let's actually get that Facebook logo in order so we will need to have two uh two more styling stuff so up here uh we have the header left which is going to be display Flex right uh we have the justify content which is spaced evenly and right uh when I added the he of uh head for the image the logo uh to 40 pixels it actually all rendered out uh the way I want it to look like so as you can see it's currently it is display Flex right awesome um do we got any questions Frankie or are we good to go see Umar kusum Mani asks hey clever programmer can I make content for you guys yes my friend right now we're looking for developers that can actually you know speak in front of camera show other people how to you know build their skills as programmers if you guys are that person whether you know JavaScript maybe even in Python you know reach out to cazi at on Instagram and we'll be in touch you know review whether your skills are are good if you're a good fit for you know the company or everything but if you guys are interested in creating content for us you know we are currently looking for developers right David yeah that's right that's right okay with that said actually let's go and style the input awesome so we will be uh adding like a header input uh which is like we want the whole thing to be like Flex right so as you can see on the right hand side uh everything is so the whole um display uh or whole input uh got aligned into a row yeah and we want the items to be aligned in the center that's why it's like in the uh middle uh we want to set the background color to this E2 F5 uh nice little color thing because that's actually the exact same color that Facebook uses uh for their uh input fields we also want like a 10 pixel of padding uh margin on the left as well and the Border radius of 33 pixels now we also want that uh ugly looking input field to like kind of like be transparent and we will be just adding like a header input uh and like actually notice that I'm in um I'm targeting the input inside of header input right so I set the bordered none background color to transparent and the outline width to zero nice uh next up we have the header Center which we actually want to have display Flex again and we wrote Flex one here because we want the uh the header Center to take use as much space as it needs as possible and we just want everything to be uh in the center okay nice and if we go back to header. JS now um here is something I want to call your uh attention to so we are adding header options inside of header center right and that's what we are going to be targeting right now so for header options of course we want to have display flx we want to have them aligned to the center we want to uh add zero padding uh top and bottom I actually added a little bit of cheat sheet over here uh Frankie can you scroll up a bit uh in the CSS file nice so so the comment in here here is actually a bit of a cheat sheet um oh I think I lost the connection to the editor again to live sh yeah uh that's weird I still see you here can you actually follow me no you're not following me because I'm clicking around I see let me see try again yeah I think I see you are you in Justified content um nope I'm actually not in the file now it says uh the host seems to be offline again that's weird we kept getting that connection problem so should we do the same thing that I just did yeah yeah let's actually restart the whole vs code on your end and won't take long so let's just command Q out of X code I mean sorry Visual Studio code then open it up again waiting for it to load awesome what we're going to do now is invite David again seems like we're losing connection yeah seems like we need to do it a couple of times so start collaboration session done sign in with GitHub let's get it currently signing in with GitHub once again let's see so I'm just doing this on my other screen guys so you guys don't have to you know go through the whole process again yeah like I mean live share was such an awesome tool and then it started to have all these bugs I think it's actually a bug on their side yeah I I we had this issue with the sunny last time uh for some reason L the okay got the new got the new link nice open it up okay so I'm joining at the moment as we speak I see you're here okay nice um it says you left though once again it says joining now you joined again okay nice awesome awesome yeah I see all the files now okay perfect okay uh can you follow me Target is not currently editing a shared document uh that's not true okay um let's try that I go into header. JS still I'm in header. CSS now there we go so I think okay sure now I'm following you yep now I'm following you okay nice okay so what I what I left off is that I left a little bit of cheat sheet over here so if you add these two properties into petting it will mean that the first number is going to be uh for top and bottom and the second one is going to be for left and right and we are going to be using that again with the header options so uh I'm just going to pop it in so header option we have a display Flex uh we will be aligning them into the center um we are adding padding like no padding up top and down below and we will have 30 pixels of padding like uh in between them and whenever we hover them hover over them we want the cursor to be a pointer okay next up let's actually make it look super nice whenever we hover over them so uh whenever you hover over like actually we need to add like a colon here uh with a hover Word file following so first up we got uh we want to set the background color to the Facebook Gray uh I'm just going to call it Facebook Gray from now on uh we want to set the Border radius to 10 pixels uh align them Center of course um with the same padding and we want to disable uh B border and buttom right and one thing that we want to do as well is to set nicely and blue uh set those apps to completely blue oh I think uh I think we need to fire up the application again because it's not updating can you give me yeah perfect okay so I'm typing in mpm start yeah it goes ahead and does oh um sear file directory oh I see see okay yeah I I know what happens so I wasn't in the correct folder yeah B and PM uh start nice so now we should be able to see it updating on the right hand side as I do decoding so let's wait a little while it starts the development server and so it's loading up the page again right what's up it's loading up the page again yeah yeah ah yeah that's the one uh can you full screen it yes so what we just done is uh those Center icons right so you can see that uh the one that we actually uh made active is now uh the Facebook blue because uh I'll be explaining it a little bit and we also also have those uh hover over effects right so it can just hover over uh one of the icons nice so that that's the other thing we did two things right it's it's the it's two things on the hover over it's one it makes the mouse a pointer and two exactly it makes the background gray so you know you want to make design very much intuitive because sometimes you know you add icons but you don't add the hover effects like this and it doesn't give directions to your user to let them know that you can actually click on these icons exactly that's right that's right okay let's go back to the code so down here I've actually added this uh mui SG icon D root and that is actually a class name which is automatically added to all the uh icons inside of material UI so if you don't know what this is this is basically targeting thing all the um material UI icons inside of the header option active class right that's all you need to that that's how you need to translate it for yourself okay we also want to add uh to the active icon some nice little uh border button so it will actually show that this is the active stuff uh can you full screen the uh current build yes go nice so you can actually now see if I go ahead and remove that for a bit um it just it just disappeared that little uh blue line right on the home yeah now it should be there very soon um so let's refresh the app so see it I couldn't save it actually okay oh damn uh you can remove the uh command oh connection is lost again from live share mhm what is happening with live share today man it's crazy I don't know I have no clue dude let see I'm going to invite you again here's the link I'm not get to x out of it this time though okay okay it says you you seem to be offline again okay so when that what is going on yeah when that happens what I have to do then is just cancel find Visual Studio code this this has been working so let's continue doing it and save you guys a little bit of time and then start collaboration set session there we go and here should be the next link David you go bro okay let's try it out okay nice it's loading okay hey likes to restart the whole application like five times yeah oh cool I just saw you join let me see let me actually follow you okay nice okay so I'm just removing command from the uh from that bro cool and it says okay live share failed to update oh Jesus what's going on wait did I see you or did you just leave again okay no no it's there okay it's there okay nice oh okay it's live it's working finally Yuri is like live share ever programmer promoted you so much is this the way you pay back kind of okay um so we now need to yeah so oh my God the other one just died we got so many sessions open okay so with that okay nice so I've just added two more um two more properties here one of them is going to uh trigger all these um all these material UI icons and make them gray all the other ones right yeah so the active is going to be blue and all the other ones are going to be gray uh gray and we actually want them to turn blue whenever you hover over them so if you can go ahead and demo that that would be awesome awesome so let's actually make this full screen so you guys can check it out should I reload it yeah no no no uh I mean oh hold on I think yeah because uh because I need access to the terminal again so I do command shift p right command shift p and then share terminal then read and write there you go yeah okay um um okay boom nice okay I think yeah M awesome boom there we go and now I just go ahead and type in start says hey guys I'm going to go head out now I need to do some important work see y'all in the community awesome thara is one of the pwj students if you guys are finding any value in any of these teachings any of these bills that we're getting out for you guys make sure to click the link in the description below it's going to be the first link and that link is going to take you to a free 1hour training on how to actually profit and make money from JavaScript as well as you know develop those JavaScript skills so if you're interested in that exactly click the link below right David yeah exactly just click it it's going to be a session uh I think by kazy right okay I think the app now should be running okay so now let's let's actually reload it I don't think I even had to do that but now they're turning blue now you can see they turn blue that's it right that's the that's the thing we wanted to uh see okay uh let's go and I'll let the rest because I don't know how much connection do we got so header info we want it to be uh display Flex We want everything to be centered and we want the text to be uh have a margin left of 10 pixels we also want the header right to have uh display flex and you can demo that too so it's going to be the right hand side of your screen with the uh Avatar and all those kind of stuff uh Frankie can you can you show it let me see um so the Avatar is this yeah so now everything is streamlined added to the center and made made like we arranged them nicely yeah so they used to be all in the middle now they actually have a little bit of order to it and it looks like a like an actual navigation bar type of thing right you got the Avatar over here with a username you got the menu buttons right here and then we also got the input field right here together with the exactly yeah okay so that pretty much concludes the header build let's go ahead and create this sidebar um so what you want to do is go ahead and create a new file in the components folder yeah is it the left sidebar or the right sidebar that we're working uh left sidebar so the right sidebar is actually going to be widget yeah so I'm just going to go ahead and create a sidebar. JS file as well as a sidebar. CSS file currently I think I'm not following you so let me let me go back to it says that I'm following you okay okay yeah I for some reason it's not creating again there we go go you're in display Flex right now nope I'm nowhere actually um yeah connection is lost again wow I have no clue what's what's going on okay I'm going to do it faster now I don't know why this is happening today yeah let's see but it's nothing that we can't tackle or we can't fix so moving right ahead with this now what I'm going to do is start collaboration session yes yep now I'm going to send you the new link on Skype let's get it boom sent now what I'm going to do is I'm going to share the terminal as well and read and right for you okay perfect now I'm joining and all this kind of stuff and hopefully 10th time let's get it yeah yep let's crush it hey everybody by the way how do you like the build we got the header component ready for y'all it looks amazing amaz amazing hover over functionalities to it now we're going to make it even prettier oh damn it says uh your network connection is poor mine and I couldn't I couldn't join uh because some Network issue it says it's your oh my God it says you're offline again it's so annoying let me see um okay I'll start up slack and I'll start dropping uh the code piece by piece to you and just say whatever um you need to put it okay let's do that while that happens and yeah going to try it again okay I'm going to need to open up slack for now okay perfect kis remember yeah yeah it's kazy okay um boom okay uh try out this new session just invited you again no okay let's try it out if it doesn't work let's just go with the uh slack way of doing yep he joined now I'm going to share the terminal read and right okay here we go s boom now um says you're currently not in the shared document I think you're still getting in so I just um I'm still loading okay let's not waste too much time on this it for some reason it doesn't load at all now um let's go with the other way okay so I'm going to drop you the whole side let's uh okay so let's actually create a are you in the folder I'm actually not even in the folder now I don't see it right so Commando yep M maybe that's why I couldn't start the session with you okay so I'm here now I'm in the folder right yeah yeah yeah okay um let's go ahead and create a new file called sidebar. JS uh with a capital S inside of source and uh inside source and components so let's click components components uh it's it's right yeah okay so that's where you want to go ahead and create a new file yeah and that's going to be uh sideb the JS with a capital S at the front uh no no no uh like the Side Bar yeah yeah uh just simple J yep perfect and what I want you to do uh paste in there is going to be a snip it um okay I just uh sent you the snippet on slack and I'm going to explain what's what so let's go ahead copy everything from there and just uh Chuck it in there nice so what this is so up top we are actually importing all Lads of kind of emojis and um and all those icons that uh we are going to be using inside of the um inside of the component and then we are actually creating the component so actually there is a line that we do not need so con user dispatch uh line 15 you can delete that we will be adding that later on okay um so uh and we also okay so it's going to freak out because uh the sidebar row is not actually created just yet so uh the first cbar row has uh user photo URL we don't need those let's just uh for further URL let's just leave that completely empty um here user photo URL yeah and and the source uh user Side Bar Row first one I just delete everything and just add like a um okay hold on uh let me let me send it again uh okay uh boom I'm actually G to try okay let me prep stuff for you I'm going to to do the start collaboration session once again okay okay let's try that too so that's the new link check it out okay let's try it out hopefully this time around it will work nice so I see Joel green answered to Daniel so this is I think a good answer for the questions it's awesome that our community is active enough to help other beginner people you know other beginner developers answer the questions and Joel green says at Daniel capitalize your document names it's how react can know it's a file and can be used as a JS tag exactly exactly that's why I had to capitalize the s in the sidebar. JS file that's right were you able to jump in was it loading uh it is actually loading as we speak Peak awesome that's cool I've just sent you the new snippet uh let's actually change everything to that cool let's see what the new snippet is got it okay nice and just uh delete everything and and chck that in okay so I'm going to do command B to hide that and then I'm going to actually do this and okay so what we are doing up top is we are importing uh the sidebar. CSS file we are up uh we are importing the sidebar row component uh next up which is not yet created but we will be created uh in a minute then we are uh importing a bunch of icons uh the local hospital Emoji flag people chat storefront video library expand more we are importing all these icons and then uh Down Below in the return section the rendering session uh section of the file we are actually uh adding a sidebar row uh which the first one will not have a source and the second uh and the title is going to be Frankie that is going to be showing the active user at the moment and once we set up our data layer that's where um that's where our uh the photo URL and all those kind of stuff will go uh next up we will have like a the local hospital icon as the icon that we pass in and the title is going to be covid19 information center we also have it for Pages we also have it friends messenger Marketplace videos and more and in in order that that's uh how we add all those icons into the project so you yes you can actually uh pass through um icons to other components let's actually uh go ahead and create the sidebar row. JS file um you can do that uh on the left hand side I'm still joining actually the uh session okay so I create a new file or what yeah yeah yeah so it's going to be called sidebar row with a capital S and capital r so it's like camo casing yeah sidebar row um this right side bar row. JS yeah we Capital yeah that's exactly and we want to have actually a sidebar that uh CSS and the sidebar row. CSS so another one called sidebar. CSS right yeah sidebar. CSS and sidebar row. CSS side r. CSS awesome and then we got and the sidebar row. CSS side. CSS that's right okay um so sidebar row and actually uh inside of side oops sidebar. CSS we're not adding too much stuff uh we pretty much just uh adding these things um let me send it to you real quick uh see this maybe try closing your Visual Studio code yeah I I can try that too yeah okay I'm going to Comm and Q out of it and see and I'll add that sidebar thing to the sidebar. CSS file right exactly got it seems like joined the collaboration session now I see you and now I'm following you awesome now I'm going to show you the the terminal so short terminal and read and write dope got it nice perfect okay I think I'm I'm I'm back here nice okay perfect uh are you following me actually let's go everybody yep yep I'm following you I think that deserves a air horn okay fine back in the game bro let's get it yeah okay so one thing I want to add is inside of sidebar the div should have the class name of uh sidebar right so other so any other way we will not be able to Target it nice okay um I'm going to uh yeah perfect okay mpm start I just fired up the project so it should be running in any minute also we have 170 people live at this moment thank you guys so much for being here and staying throughout the whole technical difficulties but like I said man it's part of the journey it's part of being a developer thank you guys for being here we're at $26 in chat donations thank you guys so much air for y thank you so much guys appreciate it yeah uh are you following me actually let me see yep app oh damn connection lost again hey let's get it yeah I'll just I'll just do everything just um send me send me the the Snippets and I'll and I'll make sure to do I'll go let's go with the Snippets okay so inside of sidebar yeah nice okay so let's actually go ahead and set up the sidebar uh row. CSS file right so so sidebar sidebar row that's CSS okay is going to be what I just boom um so we are pretty much targeting targeting the whole thing uh Frankie is going to be able to copy it very soon yep so make sure I get everything for y'all okay sidebar row awesome yeah side row CSS nice there we go okay so first thing first we were targeting the whole thing uh we want to have it display Flex align them to Center padding 10 pixels cursor pointer we also want to make it light gray and have a border radius of 10 pixels when we are hovering over those stuff uh and we actually want all the all the text inside of there because remember uh there is text in there uh which is currently we haven't built just yet um but we will be do it very soon so the text in there should have a margin left of 20 20 pixels and the font weight of 600 and side by row and Target all the um material UI icons and have the font size uh like extra large and the Facebook blue give it yeah yeah the Facebook blue uh Facebook blue nice okay um so what we need to have inside of sidebar row that JS is going to be this nice so I just sent you the component nice see okay set by row that's the component jsjs okay so open up in the files .js here we go boom yeah and just B it so pretty much what we do is we are importing Avatar and we are importing the Side Bar the JS file um and inside and there is like we're destructuring everything that we are passing through inside to this component right um and then we are uh creating a div uh which will have the Avatar and which will receive uh a source and if we have an icon we are uh dropping in the icon which is also popped into uh as a dependency to the uh component okay so with that said actually if you could go ahead and uh start running the server that will be great so just open up a terminal and let's okay so it's running um let's actually go into Google Chrome then and see how it is nice just uh refresh the whole thing refreshing here we go I don't think it's saved right um yeah let's go back to um yeah and with a control C you can uh shut out like sometimes it forgets to render uh let's just type yeah and just let's uh type in mpm start again npm start yeah so it's it's refreshing or loading up actually yeah nice that's good that's good little bit of time LOL I remember what we haven't done so let's go back to app.js and app.js okay yep exactly and what you need to do is import uh the sidebar from the component slide sidebar just sent you the command to it uh yep and you need to import the whole component up top nice and then you also need to add uh the the actual sidebar to the app oh uh and you need to close the tag uh instead of the dot I I made a typo close the tag like that uh nope no no no uh you need that like uh down there down below uh at line three line 10 no no no line 10 yeah that's where that's where you're actually adding the uh the sidebar component right okay but what do I add here the semicolon or the apostrophy I just delete that that uh delete this side bar yep and you actually want to add uh this add side okay so close it I see yeah yeah awesome so now close the Side Bar yeah just like that perfect now it should be importing uh and something is going south on up there uh if you can just go ahead and uh import it again I don't can see what what's up let's see okay let's see I'm in app.js import should I put it on the top all the way to the top or something no no no that should be good actually uh no wait hold on um CSS what kind of what kind of is it not like CSS or something no no no no no no no it should be like that uh the quesa mark uh what kind of quesa Mark is it apostrophe right oh it's the other one so it should be this one yeah and let's change the first one as well should be it should be this one right and then change this one to this one yeah and yeah it adds a double in uh and just Del a second okay that should be good okay so it was a wrong okay apostrophe yeah okay what what's it saying now uh can you make it hold on let me let me try the zoom uh I can't no no no um just can you just show the error message okay can sidebar to comp something's something not right um this side BJs well hello I may may be in in the uh code actually oh h on 91 wait so you're back here now I can follow you or what I think so yeah that's crazy okay okay that's okay I don't know what what's going on awesome sorry guys this is um bit crazy today but we're going to go we're going to get through it guys stick around you guys are going to learn a lot of things definitely a lot okay nice is not defined yes okay so what I'm doing now is basically import uh creating the whole thing again and for some reason um import Avatar something is not going well four um okay we might need to add like an actual um link actual link to it uh okay so I'm grabbing one copy image address um yeah right there now it's uh it's about sidebar row somebody says there is an error in line four okay it says now it's working okay okay check it out on the right hand side oh I see so I see finally beautiful okay so I'm gonna make it should I make it full screen uh yeah yeah let's actually check it out and yeah this is how it's looking right now this is the Avatar with Sunny's face and with the my name your name yes yeah this is the Side Bar okay so if you hovering over it uh is it working so I see the pointer but I don't see I don't see the other okay so it failed to to compile right now there we go just restarted mhm checking out the hover effects they don't appear yet seems like it hasn't refreshed for those side bar row without CSS oh my God now this is getting to become a debu session again yep yep shakar asks why don't you guys add a session in the mongod DB then you won't need to log in every time you reload the page we could do that but that would like be like lots of work and I lost the connection once again that's a good idea okay l guess I lost the connection again okay let me know what Snippets I should add so that we can proceed with it not right now while we do that I'll also share another link or something because we need to get this fixed apparently yeah live share is giving us attitude guys yeah we definitely need to find an alternative because this is just um ruining a lot of stuff let's see you want to share with me few snippet of codes so I can start doing it um I mean let's fix this first um can you actually share uh the eam viewer with me uh so I can have a better view what's going on so you need to find I thought I was already sharing eam with you no oh yeah on Skype yeah yeah like just just a uh just cam okay uh don't matter it says you just left the collaboration session awesome let's see okay I'll try try to commment Q out of it again and see if that solves the issue so that I can let me see share collaboration session there we go then I got it here I'm going to send you the new one I just messaged Sunny see if he has a solution for the debugging of the live share should say open and browser try that okay start a live share in the browser start a live share in the browser he says h should we test that out let's see let's see so second so M shift p start C how do we do it in the browser though you know how I have no clue okay it says you're offline again I think there is kind of like some connection issue uh on your end so I'll stop collaboration uh I don't know actually can you zip the zip the file and try if I go ahead and uh do the live share with you and then like present that okay so just tell me how do I zip it okay so let's go let's find the containing folder uh where the project is second yeah okay so what were you saying um in finder just uh find the folder where where the project is yes so it's going to be and umh okay nice uh going to Facebook M no no no uh go into Facebook M and delete the known modules folder delete it okay yep just delete it done nice and go out and zip out the whole uh third 30th of September yeah yeah just compress and drop it over on slack and I try to work it out dope so dropping it over on slack nice where's the your disc hopefully just hopefully this will work okay uh send it sent so it's loading up for you and it's about let me see right there there we go nice Okay um I'm saving it I'll be there with you guys in a moment just debugging this right now let me see while this is going on I'm going to start another collaboration session just cuz um I'll I'll start uh I'll start one and drop it to you and hopefully uh you will be able to join that and then and then we are going to be able to work it the other way around so that I go ahead and uh do all this stuff okay so joining Visual Studio code awesome there is no application to set open okay now I'm installing all the dependencies which would have taken crazy amount of time if you zip them so while you're uh loading up your vs code to share it I'll just go ahead and um set everything up and how do I I'm here I'm here on this thing but it doesn't let me join it should just refresh refresh and it should uh pop up uh that it wants to open vs code uh what's it saying what if we try doing it through the browser because that's what Sunny said right now I mean I'm trying to send you a collab session so that I am going to be hosting the project and you will be able to uh connect it through it and then share what I'm doing uh on my computer and then it's going to be uh I mean it's going to be the other way around it's just I'm going to be the host yeah the only thing is I can't actually choose the visual studio code insiders see what I mean I'm go back to Applications it doesn't it doesn't actually let me choose it join manually what does that mean let's see join a session manually oh so Sunny's calling me what's up Sunny yes um is it the full Facebook David yes right it's the whole it's the whole Facebook Facebook yeah right now we're doing the sidebar okay in that case rest mean okay okay do it so it says I'm just trying to see yeah so I'm trying to so David actually sent me a link and I just open it up but the thing is right now it's loading and it doesn't actually let me choose you code as the southware to should I try browser or something yes David has the code and shared with me his live share I mean it was the other way around up until nowen another zo M so yeah that's what set mic and do a screen awesome so I share my screen right of of him sharing his screen on Zoom got it okay let's go that way it's one crazy way but do that then thanks man appreciate it okay [ __ ] crazy all right yeah so that's what we're going to have to do guys what we're going to do is David is going to share his code through Zoom so I'm going to open up you want to send me a zoom link uh yeah we can okay so we're doing Zoom okay yeah so you're going to be sharing your screen through Zoom make sure to mute the mic and I'll make sure I'll mute it for my end and then I'll be sharing that with the people okay okay so I'm just joining Zoom and starting up in a bit sorry for the technical difficulties guys but it's what doesn't kill you makes you stronger as the quote says and exactly right now we're going to be strong [Laughter] AF okay um so I'm waiting for you to do the okay let's you can actually go ahead and uh join the zoom I'll be setting up everything uh once again um boom like all the stuff that we got yeah razi there we go Zoom is loading up now I'll join I'll Jo with audio but let me just mute it there we go mhm so okay so now now we should be good to go we are connected on Skype we're connected on Zoom perfect awesome just make sure to to actually zoom in a little bit more on the code cuz it's a little bit small for me MH okay okay I have it have everything zoomed okay guys so uh I'm just in before uh the things went crazy before creating the sidebar so I'm just going to go ahead and do the sidebar thing again so I'm creating a sidebar. JS I'm doing the RFC who I'm I'm doing the RFC rafc stuff uh that we have already done um and I'm going to be creating so I'm going to be importing a bunch of stuff uh which are essentially all the material UI icons that we are using throughout this um this very um what you call it component right and down here I'm actually adding a class name of uh of sidebar and that's what we uh we will have here okay and I'm also adding a couple of uh sidebar uh elements uh hopefully this time we will uh we will have everything uh working uh and the title is going to be Frankie nice and we also need to import the CSS file which I haven't created just yet and let's do it right now and we also need yeah uh so we have the side barow so I'm actually dividing it up a bit so guys you can actually go ahead and copy this uh code so what I'm doing here I'm importing react with the normal rafc uh type of stuff I'm importing the sidebar row component which is not defined yet but we will get there in a bit uh I'm importing all these icons which are going to be used in here and essentially these are going to be on the left hand side uh where uh all the sidebar is going to sidebar stuff is going to happen uh we have all this text in there that we want uh want it to display I'm removing all these lines and the first line essentially is going to be the one that will have a icon uh which will show the logged in person's uh face and the name but we are actually mocking these out with uh with a couple of um data So currently it should be sunny Sunny's face and Frankie's name which is kind of crazy but that's what I had on my clipboard okay let's go ahead ahead and create the side whoops uh let's go ahead and create the side uh bar. CSS file which we are already importing and we have already um have it okay nice so we are actually adding a padding uh up top and down below at 25 pixels and 10 pixels to the right and the left and we are also adding a flux uh of 33 nice so with that done I'm just going to go ahead and uh close that and let's see if actually it this thing loads up but this doesn't load up because I haven't imported it into app.js so now is the time to go ahead create a new row and go ahead and type your uh sidebar and if you can oh damn uh sidebar so I want you to see it on the right hand side that it is saying Auto Import so it's actually importing it right right here so you need to add that line if it doesn't import it for you but because it did for me uh I don't have to worry about that can you actually zoom in a little bit more on the code David oh yeah sure uh is it cool okay nice um something is going yeah uh because I don't have the sidebar uh row file ready just yet but I'm just going to go ahead and create that so sidebar row. Js nice uh I'm just going to go RFC perfect so with that done this is how the application looks like right now why it's not showing anything uh good good question because we are importing this stuff uh which doesn't actually have any single thing uh inside of uh there right so if you go ahead like sidebar o doesn't actually do anything so actually what I'm going to be doing is I will be adding all this stuff so we are actually capturing the source which will be the link uh for the Avatar right so you can see it right here I'm uh I'm also passing in an icon and a title uh which will be used for the actual um the actual uh yeah so this is what h what is happening at the moment right and actually one thing that we forgot with the um C no no no with with the cleanup process at the very beginning which is my mistake uh is cleaning up app.css so we just go ahead and delete everything from app. CSS I'm sorry guys uh this is being a rough day and we also need to add a star uh which is margin zero uh to the index. CSS okay now uh we should be good to go yeah so now everything is getting uh in order uh we got Sunny's face we got Frankie we got all these uh logos so it's getting good actually believe it or not we are going to be on track do we got any show the app on the side of the code um yeah I can do then boom okay nice uh and I will actually make it a little bit smaller and then I can so I can okay so is the code easily readable yes nice okay uh so we have the application on the right hand side I will just make it bigger once we are uh once I'm showing something and otherwise it will be like this small okay so now I will be actually going ahead and creating the uh sidebar row. CSS file uh and closing that thing and I'm actually importing it because we're going to be using that for the styling and for the sidebar row uh we have a couple of stuff going on so notice that uh on the right hand side uh we actually had these things done right so what essentially happens is that we added a display Flex to the whole thing so every single row will be uh flexibly displayed that means it will be passed into a one row everything is going to be aligned to Center ping is going to be 10 10 pixels cursor pointer uh Side by row hover so whenever I hover over them you see this is the animation that that you got right and so that's the light gray background and the Border radius of Thum pixels so notice it's not not too huge but you can actually see uh that there is a border radius right so that's H that's crazy okay um nice and we also added uh every single row like 20 pixels margin left and the font weight of 00 nice and we also targeted all the uh material UI icons right so remember all these uh all these little icons have a have this uh class name where and we targeted them to be extra large and we added them the Facebook blue color nice with that done uh we can say that we are done with the Side Bar hey that serves an air horn air horn on the time nice okay uh let's actually go ahead and start covering up the feed so what are we going to be doing the with the feed uh we actually have the H whoa there is some party going on in here so the feed is going to be this part uh where we have all these stories we have um we actually have couple more components this is one uh uh big uh big component which will have a couple more components right we also have this as the message sender component and we also have this huge po which will have a couple more smaller components so I hope this visual breakdown helped a lot for you guys and actually this is what we are going to be working with uh right now so I'm just going to go back to my local one and let's actually go ahead and create uh the necessary stuff so we will have a feed. JS file which will which will have a couple of stuff inside of it okay so let's start up with an rafc awesome and we will be importing a couple of stuff but let's just not uh worry about those for now um what we will have is basically um boom so we will have we will give a class name of feed um right here we will be uh importing the story real uh which is actually uh this part all right so that whole thing uh which will like have more stuff we will have the message sender which is this part and this is something that we will be do later on all right so uh let's actually add a bog post instead of this and we will be using it later on when we have the back end ready right so so let's actually create the story real first and the message sender first um so let's create a story real. JS file and the uh message sender. JS file nice um so I'm going to be adding this is not going to be used yeah okay perfect so now we have a not crashing application that's a good uh good sign um store real what's up that's always a good sign yeah exactly I love the story today right I love the story real components because they make it so that it's not just you know a blank kind of like an input bar and you like you know it seems it adds so much layout to it it adds like almost Dimension to it other like otherwise it would look a little bit Tod in my opinion so it's good experience yeah so I actually got these crazy images from the internet I just uh typed in obstruct portrait I think and got all these uh all this stuff okay so what we will be having inside of here is basically a class name which will be story real right because we somehow we need to uh Target all this stuff and we will actually adding more uh components inside of here right so we want to have like a story which has a couple of stuff like an image a profile pick whoops profile pick and a name which will be a title this time so this is what we want to have now um okay so perfect uh what we want to have is create a new file which will be story. JS we got a tons of components this time guys this is crazy okay so the story is basically importing the Avatar right because that's what we will be using for the person's Avatar Photo on the story we're going to have the H1 that's going to be the title which is going to be the name and this is where we are putting the um stories so sorry the person's profile Source right okay um and we ALS o want to have like a background image uh for the whole uh div which will be the image URL which we are passing in from the story rail right and we are currently notice that we are using inline styling which is literally like adding a style to the div which we uh and we're adding the background image which is going to be have a URL and we are passing in the actual URL into that uh styling right and the class name is going to be story so that we can style the whole thing nicely now let's actually uh go ahead and import and make it look nice but first um let's actually import is the background image the the art pictures that you got exactly exactly exactly so I went back to app.js so that we can actually check this thing out later on when it works not now of course uh but notice that I've imported it again with Auto Import okay all right um so inside a feed so message sender is not def yeah uh what happened is that story real wasn't important as well as uh message sender either yeah so I'm Auto importing everything you need to have these two lines of code to in order to make this app working nice so now we have it so store real uh we basically want to go ahead and import a story right it's again it's going to be Auto importing and we will be passing in a couple of stuff that we just had in here right so image profile source and title those are the stuff that we want to uh import inside of there um and I actually have these uh ready um story real so uh we will be adding those like this so we're adding the image which is going to be um story. CSS um because I haven't created it just yet so this is currently how our story looks like kind of ugly MH uh but yeah and I'm adding two more and you can literally like pass in whatever kind of image you want in here and whatever profile Source you want in here and the name again doesn't really matter as long as you're passing in these three uh properties right so and so the story is just going to go ahead and render everything everything out nicely uh on the right hand side okay so let's actually go ahead and create this story so create all the uh CSS files that we will be uh needing so we will need a message sender. CSS we will need a story. CSS um story real CSS and I think everything has a CSS and ajs pair nice so um so the story real but CSS is basically not going to be uh super complicated we just want it to be display flex but in order for to make it actually work uh we need to we need to actually go ahead and Import in right import um story real. CSS right so now we have everything in one row nice that is perfect yeah exactly uh okay with that done um let's actually go to the story. CSS file and let's make the story look super nice so what we want to have is basically uh add a position relative uh we want to like Center the background like this we want to go ahead and and like have the image uh cover the whole background right uh so that's going to be background size because remember we actually uh added it as an inline styling so the background image is going to be the image we pass in right so the uh it needs to cover it doesn't repeat we want to make sure that it only shows up once the width is going to be 120 pixels head is going to be 200 pixels uh we are adding a nice little box shadow of uh with these uh properties and we are actually adding a border radius of temp pixels um with a margin right of 10 pixels as well cursor pointer uh cursor needs to be a pointer right so when I hover over uh you you can see it turns to a pointer right okay and we also want like a nice little transition yeah which we will be adding just now so if I go ahead and hover over it uh it should be scaling right beautiful yeah you can even see the Shadows under it so the Shadows actually make those images pop up a little bit more they're very subtle but if you see under the images you can see a little bit of Gray gray right there's a little bit of gray gives a dimension makes it seem like they're pop out plus the animation is called ease in and so that's that's what you're seeing right now okay so this is how we created all these stories nice we also want to Target the story Avatar uh and add the margin of 10 pixels and the border of five pixels we want to make it uh we want to make it like really look like like Facebook is so notice that there is uh that nice little uh border we also added a little bit of uh margin here and here and we also made the Border look the Facebook blue and it's actually right uh like true here H as well as it's true over here nice and we also want to uh position the text nicely so we we add the position absolute uh the bottom is going to be like we want it uh 20 pixels from the bottom we want uh 20 pixels from the left hand side and we add a white color to it just like this right so this is the uh left 20 pixels this is bottom 20 pixels looks white and yeah that's pretty much uh setting up the individual stories that's setting up the names right on those on those covers yeah and and actually the story is is this we now we need to uh move the story real up there uh it's going to be happening very soon awesome okay um so to actually put the story reel next to uh the sidebar what we need to do is go into app.css whoops we need to go into app.css and we actually want to make the background like this uh this Facebook is white oops and we want to have we want to add the app. body to have a display Flex which is for some reason doesn't seem to be uh nicely loading but we will get there very soon okay um nice perfect okay that's CSS uh we now want to go ahead into um yep so we are kind of done with uh these stories let's actually figure out why these are not uh going next to the um right there okay we will we we will figure it out uh in just a bit let's actually go and go ahead and create the message sender um so the message sender is going to be where you make the posts pretty much right on the Facebook exactly yeah that's right so the message sender is going to be this part we will be working on this part right now okay um so the we are actually in the message sender uh. JS right now and kind of like what we want to do is uh just let's just first uh make it look nice so we pretty much have uh we want to add the class naming which is going to be uh message sender of course um we want so it is it's actually divided to two parts there is a top and a bottom as you can see on the right hand side uh I'll be zooming in a bit somebody in the comments says is says or is mail says app.js add class name appor body oh that's right nice okay got very active Community here and thank you so much SM smile thank you so much man yeah appreciate your help oh yeah um sometimes you get course if I don't add it it's not going to work sometimes you add so much thank you so much into the the actual dirt that you forget to you know have a bigger vision of what's going on it's it's very natural oh hold on okay something oh because I've add added the header inside there okay there we go there we go I just fix it awesome man okay so what I did uh and thank you so much for the comment so I added this uh class name the app. body and I just wrapped the sideb and the feed and later on the widgets that are going to come here as well inside of here and what you need to uh make sure is that the header is outside right so as you can see it's not in the app. body okay um let's actually go back to the message sender. JS nice so what we will have we will have a message sender uh top and that will contain an avatar oh I'm going to hide the left side so we will have an avatar which will have a source uh I'm just going to pop in um the usual Sunny image yeah and yeah it's right there uh you can already see it it's right there nice and we also want to have a form uh which will pretty much contain an input actually uh two inputs one of them is going to be a text and the other one is going to be for a file so we will literally go ahead and we will be uploading files to mongod DB right so so the input so the text input is going to be a type of text um we will have a place holder with them what's on your mind and on change we will be triggering off the E uh we will be setting the input so we want to save the input so we need to introduce a UST State hook right and that's something we haven't imported yet so we need to import them of course and that is kind of and that is actually a way of um saving like like adding variables to react so we will have a const input um and set input and we will be using it as a use State uh and initially this will be completely empty right so inside of here uh the input field is going to be a type of text we'll have the class name uh we'll have the placeholder what's in your mind the value is going to be from this state and whenever we hit a button we want to have uh we want to uh set the input to this uh thing right so whatever we press we want to save it inside of input yo what's up yeah I was just saying that it's it's taring targeting the value that you're inputting right exactly exactly that's right that's right so next up what we want to do is import uh the input as well so it's going to be a material UI input and what we need to do is Define the uh Define what how we will be uploading files so we will need to have the input with the type file with the this uh class name and we will be uh introducing an on handle change function which is essentially not going to be doing uh something super fancy it's basically going to be uh setting the image which is going to be an other um and that's going to be other um uh use state so what oops once these are done we just want them want to uh sa whatever is in input and whatever we uploaded to the uh file uh to the as a file okay next up we will be creating the sub Handle Sub submit which is essentially not going to be doing anything for now uh only when we um when we created the back end okay so it's just going to conso like submitting and that's kind of it so notice that on the right this is how it looks like at the moment but we will be adding a nice little uh styling in just a bit okay and we also want to have the button right which will trigger the handle submit uh and we also want this button to be completely hidden done okay so with that done let's actually go ahead and style this part so uh oops uh one thing we need to go ahead and import it because otherwise it's not going to work so message sender. CSS nice um nice perfect and there we can see it yeah so we want the whole thing to have like a display Flex We want to have like a margin on the top um we also want the flex direction to be column uh white background color 15% border radius a nice little um box Shadow so on the right hand side you can actually I think you can actually see all this stuff going on and with a width of 100% nice and we won the top uh to have display flexed like as you see everything sna into uh order and we want to have a uh give it a little border one pixel solid and this uh this type of white whsh uh pading bottom is going to be 15 pixels and a and a general pading is going to be 15 pixels I don't think that line of code is actually going to be necessary ni so the padding of 15 pixels is that just padding all the way around exactly so if you're just adding that one thing it's going to be add it all the way around MH okay and we want to go ahead and Target the form and want this to be use up as much space as possible and we want to have it a display Flex right so it's uh actually updating as as I save the file right this is how it looks uh at this moment and we want to actually go ahead and Target the actual input and like literally design it like this so give it a background color of this Facebook is gray uh we want to have a border radius of 999 pixels we want to uh remove the margin from above and below and add 10 pixels to both sides and the padding uh it's going to be five pixels up and down and 20 pixels on both sides and we want to disable the borders and the outline width so that's kind of how it's going to be looking like okay nice and we literally want the message sender to be like little tiny little uh we want this to be uh not like just 20 pixels that's all we need and we also want the button uh to be completely uh unseeable so we will be just adding these uh stuff and it's done it's gone so the height is zero width is zero uh background color T transparent color transparent and borders none that's kind of what how we uh uh disable the button one thing which is um which I don't like is that this form is not looking like how I want it to look like um as it's under the form uh let me actually check the other file oh yeah so here we go um so we should be actually using up as much space as possible but instead well we are just not doing it okay okay uh and one thing I forgot to add is is we need to make the message sender input uh to be uh Flex one which means you use up as much space as possible and as we need right okay and now let's go ahead and actually create the bottom so the bottom is going to be it's not going to be super uh super hard to code but that's actually I have a snippet of code with all this stuff so what we are essentially doing is is uh basically we have the message message sender btom uh we have like message sender options inside of here so it's actually div inside of another div uh we have these uh video camera icons which are not imported just yet but we will be doing that very soon uh we want to add the title like actual text that will be rendered next to it and we are literally setting the color now I'll be going ahead and importing all these stuff yeah it's freaking out uh right so this is literally the uh only thing that you will need to import so the video cam icon photo library icon and the insert OT icon and these are the paths so it's pretty easy it literally tells you what to import and you will have all these uh lovely code uh icons right there so the red camera photos and the feing nice they look exactly like the Facebook ones it's awesome right so I bet Facebook uses a lot of material UI right yeah I I I actually think so I actually think they they really do it okay um oops okay so let's go back to our CSS file and make that look nice as well so um so the message sender button it should be display Flex again and we should like uh evenly uh justify the content right and evenly distribute the space and we also want to add a 20 pixel padding to all these uh buttons like all around uh we want to have we want to uh make them display Flex align everything to the center uh give the text uh of a gray color and the margin to be five pixels uh and let's actually set the um option let's actually design these Tex stuff so notice that uh I added a font size of medium right so I made it a bit smaller and I added a margin so right now there is no space in between here but uh as I'm adding this there is our space right 10 pixels I think it breathe I like it yeah exactly and now it literally looks like if it was Facebook yeah yeah when you don't do that that it looks a little bit less like easy to read yeah after you have the spacing then it's easier to read yeah like I mean it's it gives the whole thing like a little bit of breeding as you said okay um with that done um we also want these two uh light like have a little bit of background so if notice that if I go here it has a little background and and if I go here there's no background so I want to have like a border um no I I want to have a hover stuff I'm talking stupid stuff so I want whenever I'm hovering over I want the B uh background color to be set to this Facebook Gray and the Border radius to be 20 pixels right that's kind of how we do it it's super simple okay uh do we actually see any questions by the way as of now I don't see any inent questions people have been dropping guys if you guys have any questions you know David and I are here and we're here to answer everything so make sure to drop some questions below and we'll happily just answer them for you exactly I think the technical issues kind of like threw everybody off yeah people the the weak ones you know Only the Strong R yeah we we are actually 124 strong hey I mean that's the core team imagine imagine a room full of 128 people that's a lot of people I that's actually a lot lot of people guys literally if you find this valuable like drop a comment hit the like button like show that show the support and show that you're still here with us uh even through these hard times when we are facing all these technical difficulties right that's right let's see I think I got a I got a question here okay from yuf he says clar programmer is CSS in react component scoped meaning if CSS styling is applied only to the component it is imported to yes that is correct but don't forget that you can actually import the same CSS file to over all the components so normally so the CSS is only applied to that component where you uh import it but you can go ahead and import it to several other components as well okay um nice let's actually uh go on and I think we are done with the message sender we are done with uh stories let's go what's left the right I think right side bar our right side bar is definitely left and we we need the posts don't forget about the posts the post yeah that's right so we have all this stuff going on here but what we need now is going to be the um so so the post. JS right we also have the post. CSS so notice that whenever I I'm creating a JS file I'm uh immediately creating the uh CSS file to it so that we have it also uh the div should automatically include uh the class name that we want to use which is at this moment is going to be be post and I'm already importing the uh post. CSS file so I want forget it and let me actually see if we are missing anything so yeah we have the story we have the message sender now we need to go with the post so let's actually go ahead and import post now I'm Auto importing again so up uh it's going to be here and what I need to do is basically uh pass in a couple of stuff so we are literally passing in the profile pick because a post has a user which uh who who actually has the profile pick right oh damn hold on uh so I'm going to be uh adding the usual uh SU pick and we also will have a message which is going to be yo this is a message nice can you hit command B to hide the side what's up can you hit command B oh yeah yeah right thanks thanks yeah we are also going to have a time stamp which we will be using to sort everything so that the most recent one is going to be up top and all the others are going to be down below but right now let's just go with time and we will have an image name I will explain that later on why we need that but we need to get the front end working first like looking nice and then we can jump into the back end and then I can explain why it's uh the way it is so the image name is going to be uh image name for now and we will have a username uh which is going to be uh let's let's go with with Frankie because Frankie's name and Sunny's picture is the best combo Best of Both Worlds yeah exactly nice so we literally have a uh post ready for us which is not getting rendered out because the post is actually empty so um what we are going to be doing is basically destructure everything that that we receive we can do that like this so we are putting these quiggly braces profile pick image name username time stamp message all this kind of stuff uh nice and what we will be doing is so the post actually has two parts again actually yeah yeah two parts so one of them is going to be the um post top uh which will include an avatar uh which is going to be so the source is going to be the actual profile pick right that's what we are passing in and the class name is going to be post aat Avatar right nice so yep and next up we will have have a post top info which is literally not going to uh include too much stuff it's basically going to include the Tim stamp and the user's name right so not nothing super fancy but we will have it uh so that it yeah so that it functions nicely so what we are doing here so we we have the Avatar right here we we have the username the h3e right here which is Frankie and we have this line of code which I'm explaining just now so what we are doing here is we basically grab this Tim stamp we will be parsing it into an integer I will explain that later uh when we have the co uh backend code ready so we will be uh creating we will be uh having uh time stamp something like uh it starts with 116 and then like comes random numbers this basically means that the how much seconds have uh passed since I think 1980 Something Right 198 something yeah yeah Unix time time date I don't know what it's called yeah yeah exactly and we will be um passing that into here but we are going to be storing it as a string inside of our database so first we need to forse it into an integer uh and we will make it a date format right so new date and we want to uh display it as a UTC string so notice that over here how it looks like boom that's what we will have and I think UTC string for those that don't know so UTC is the winter time of Britain so you know uh all the time zones are adjusted to uh England's time zone but actually England switches a time zone between summer and winter and so that everybody has like a standard only uh like time zone that doesn't switch all around because United States actually changes times uh at a different like I think two weeks ahead of Europe or after Europe I don't know so there is a two we Delay from for uh one of those uh when you're switching to summer time or or the Standard Time interesting I didn't know that yeah and the UTC is basically the the winter time zone of England right so it's kind of like that's what so if you're have like an international business and you you're setting up servers you want to go with UTC times always and you want to convert the UTC time uh uh according to where the information is relevant so actually this is kind of like what type of uh how it looks like uh I don't think I can show uh that too much but let's try it this way so I just uh flashlight it on this uh line of string I think I'm going to just go ahead grab it and so that you guys are going to be able to see how things change when I'm passing that um so this number instead of time so notice that right now it's yeah so it was invalid but as soon as I pass this thing in it turned into this stuff right it's pretty pretty sick and it actually shows it in GMT time zone nice um so with that done uh we kind of have one post ready uh yeah perfect and we will be adding more stuff uh once we have our back end so for now uh let's not worry about the image name uh and all those kind of stuff uh for now let's actually add the reaction things so let's just make a note here so image has is coming later so yeah it's freaking out again because I have all these icons not imported but let's just uh do that right now so here we go nice and we have all these icons right here so it's pretty much just adding the thumbs up with the uh text and we had the post option or we could like literally say post reaction and notice that there is another uh class which is post options it's plural so we are adding all this stuff nice okay uh I will be zooming out a bit out of it let's actually go ahead and style it okay so the whole post will have a width of 100% margin or radius 15 pixels uh background I think it should be color uh White and like give it a box Shadow nice uh we will have the post image later on don't worry about it for now it's going to be a width of 100% and nothing else uh Post stop we want that to be display Flex um oh damn I think I screw yeah uh I think oh okay so I added a post options inside side of post um post top info and post top so I want that to be out of that right right just like that okay so this is how I want this to look like for now nice okay uh so post up and we actually want the post Avatar to have a margin R of 10 pixels and we want the posttop info so literally the name we want that to have the font size of medium and the we want the time stamp which is under the P tag we want it to be gray and we want that to be small so and the post button I think that's going to be the image so let's just add it to here and once we have the back end ready we will be working with the post button so it's going to have a margin top of 10 pixels margin buttom 10 pixels and the padding uh uh top and below is going to be 15 pixels and 25 right and the left nice okay and the post options which we have just added it's going to have a padding of 10% uh 10 pixels uh one pixel solid light gray uh border top uh literally that thing over there uh we want them to be display Flex so they are right next to each other uh justify content space evenly and font size medium and we also want the color to be gray and the cursors to be pointer and the padding of 15 pixels nice uh we also wanton the post option uh each and every one of them so that we have the text like right next to the them uh we want them to be centered in every single way so vertically and horizontally and we also want the P also want to give them a pading of five pixels and we want them to uh float nice uh so post whoops so post option b uh we we are actually literally targeting the text uh Tex stuff going on here right so only only the like right I hope it's clear uh only and only the comment so not uh we're not targeting this time um the icon so it's crossed out wow I love love this screen brush thing that is amazing okay yeah okay uh oops and once we hover over we want to give it the usual uh Facebook Gray and the Border radius of 10 pixels so just that thing okay nice uh I think we kind of are done uh with designing how it looks like for now really nice really really nice so what does it mean when it's floating um I think it's kind of like floating above uh it would be my guess soing on the bottom it's what's up like the padding or the little like it gives it space on the bottom I think it's like a 3D animation ah I see I see yeah yeah yeah um one thing though we haven't added is the actual um post message so we need that in between the post top and the post options boom there we go that's going to be the message right and inside of the post button there that's where the image is actually going to come later on Boom here we go so for now post is done uh but we will be working on it a bit uh very soon okay nice um and let's actually I think the last thing last to do uh on the front end side is going to be the widget I mean I I think so going to be the right the right side bar yeah exactly that's actually we will be calling that the widget um. JS nice and what we will have here is essentially an an iframe which we are so let's actually first add the class name so it's going to be widgets and what we have here is basically an iframe which is kind of like embedding another uh web page to your website right so we're um so you can literally go ahead Google it up like uh Facebook embed iframe I think this three keywords if it's in your Google search it will show it up and Facebook is literally giving you this code and I set up the width to uh 340 head uh, 1500 and inline styling so just you know like there is the CSS kind of styling and there is the inline styling we kind of want to show you both uh so the style of border is going to be none overflow so whenever it's um going over uh on those 1500 pixels we just want that to be hidden uh we don't want it to scroll uh frame border is going to be zero uh transparency un encrypted media so these are literally like stuff that Facebook is giving you and the reason why Facebook gives you that link is because we chose to share what's in right now our live uh Facebook of clever programmer right so yeah exactly the the items that are going to populate inside of that if frame that David right now is writing is actually the real things that are being posted on our Facebook feed that's what you guys are going to see exactly and Whoa man two donations at the same time it's like they paired up at the same time thank you thank you so much man he says you guys are doing great and then a ro says you guys are great let me see you guys are great keep up the good work thank you so much thank you so much thank you so much lit that's the core team that we still have yeah that's what we core team of 109 people thank you guys literally if you like it stay with us yep yep stay till the end guys you guys are going to pick up a few great skills yeah exactly okay um and please do not spam the chat because I will block you I already blocked rush rush yeah okay um I think with that said we can literally go ahead and start up the backend stock so Frankie actually set up a mongod DB but I'm just going to go ahead and show it because there was so many stuff going on and things were like crashing and all this kind of stuff I'm just going to show everything once again this is uh actually the live applications database at the moment I just refreshed it and there is all this stuff going on so yep uh so what you can do uh is literally create a new project I will be uh going ahead and name it like FB M uh I think that's going to be more than enough I'm not adding any members uh over here so that's where you could add like uh if I I can actually uh invite Frankie um to join if he wants to nice and I can actually like literally add like uh read write manager and access admin and I'll be the um project owner so it's kind of nice so we both will be able to work on this project thank you nice anytime dude so let's go ahead and create the uh project let's go build the cluster it's um popping this question to me every single time but Pro most of the times it just doesn't do it it's just for some reason for me it does it uh and you want to go ahead and create a free cluster we don't need all these feny stuff we're is going to go with precluster you don't need to worry about any of this stuff going on and what I'm just going to do is create a cluster with the button nice uh and it's going to act so it says it's going to take 1 to three minutes but it actually usually does a bit more uh by that time I will be going ahead and uh hitting network access that button over there and I'll be uh adding an IP address nice so this time I will be adding allow access from any anywhere but disclaimer do not do it in production do not do it with any kind of client because this literally means that I could hack your database and I could do whatever I wanted to do inside of it and that's kind of like losing money so you don't want to do this in production you always want to get the IP address of the server that is going to be using it and add it inside of here you can literally add the comment I will be naming everyone uh but you can add it add like whatever server so the client name uh server uh and you can actually set it to uh six hour long whoops too much stuff uh six hour long so it's GNA expire but I'm just gonna not do that for now okay so it's going to uh work for a bit uh it's still deploying CH uh my changes and by the time I will be going ahead and uh set up the database access which is essentially uh creating a database user um so I'll be naming it uh Facebook client um aut to generate a SQL password and you want to go ahead and copy that as much times as possible so that you will have that on your clipboard I'm using offred so I'll I'm having it in a safe place but if you're not using offred you definitely well first you want to go ahead and download it or just go ahead and like add somewhere safe inside of your code so that you will have it because this is the last time you will actually see this password and let's go and hit user or add user nice so going back to the Clusters it's still being created it's doing its stuff nice uh but by the time let's actually go ahead and create our um backend stuff right so first thing first we will be what is this thing okay we don't need this stuff so first thing first we will be creating a new folder uh outside of here so it's going to be Facebook backend uh for me and I'm opening up a new terminal um I'll be actually create a um how do I create oh it's a plus button nice um so I'll be seeding into the Facebook backend and now now that I'm inside of here I want to have Git Version Control uh initialized so I'm just going to type in in it um why it's taking this much time I have no clue okay nice I must have uh made a typo and now I'm going to go ahead and start up the backend stuff right so I'm going to go ahead and type in mpm in it which is literally initializing our backend project what's up so two things two things one Vibe with us just dropped a beautiful comment much love thank you guys so much and he says Hey CP I just want to say thank you for all your content on YouTube I have learned a lot in the past one month than I've done in two years in campus basically where I am right now is because of you wow he's learning that's literally what our goal is so I'm actually attending the college as as well and um I've been there for like 2 and a half years and while I was inside of pwj and watching these lives and actually now doing these lives I've learned like 10x more than what I when uh what college has gave me W that's crazy man even even in debugging like today that was crazy oh so much bonjour Tech thank you man a $5 donation beautiful we love you guys we really appreciate you thanks for sticking around we'll continue and I also see 100 rupees from somebody up top 100 rupees yeah it was I believe it was a last oh thank you dude I no it was rushi rushi my thank you man oh my God we got so much donations nice thank you guys yeah we're at three $33 in chat donations and 454 likes that's amazing guys let's try to get that to 500 guys so smash that like button if you guys are still here and let's Carry On Let's carry strong literally our team is getting stronger we are 122 active user uh Watchers so awesome let's let's teach everybody how to code let's get it yeah exactly okay let's jump back into the code okay so we have the uh G Version Control initialized and what I'm going to do now is essentially initialize the backend Pro uh okay I was in the wrong W uh window okay so this is going to throw so when I type in mpm in it it's going to throw a couple of lines here which I've honestly never read uh this is I think it's some kind of General advices and stuff uh but right now I'm going to go ahead and name the package give a version description I'm going to leave it alone entry point make sure to set it to server.js test command empty get rippo empty keywords empty author uh Frankie oops and David whoops and the license is I see perfect now uh it's going to prompt if I'm okay with it yes I am so there we go so the Facebook back end now that we are done uh let's actually import a couple of dependencies and we will have a bunch of them this time so make sure to watch it as I'm doing it so I'm just going to type in mpm install and we will of course have Express we will have Mongoose we will have course we will have motor which we will be using to upload the image anyway you can actually drag it a little bit up so that we can see it on the screen it's like cut cutting up a little bit I mean what I could do is exit full screen and like do it like this I I I I hope it's it's better now it's cool okay nice um so we have so we have Express we have mongus we have course we have motor to up upload images and now we will have motor uh grid FS which is a no stuff so guys if you're already here this is going to be the juicy part this is going to be new stuff and this is what like literally is going to make the difference uh it's actually a motor grid of a storage so this is how we will be storing mod IM oops images inside of mongod DB uh we will also have crit FS uh stream and we will have the body parser oops body parser nice we also want to have path and we want to have Pusher because we want this we will make this real time okay so all these packages are going to take a bit of time to load but I mean I just hit return uh on all these and I'm just going to go full screen once again so so it's quickly set up and we also we already have the package.json file nice I will be closing the terminal because we don't need that anymore um and what we really want to do is up here like right on the main server.js we want to type in type and the type that we want to select is module that will allow us to write es6 code uh inside of inside of here and next thing we want to do is start and that's going to be node server.js it's going to be necessary uh for when we deploy the app to uh Heroku we will not need to worry about Auto starting the app is going to start itself up next thing you want to do uh is add a dog ignore file uh because right now on the left hand left hand side I hope I can move this thing away um okay so over there you can see it says 2K that's because we have the node modules uh inside of the uh Version Control so I'm just going to type in node modules and boom that's went back to 27 uh get ignore nice and with that done uh let's actually go ahead and create our server.js file which is for some reason the focus is always lost server.js nice so inside of here we what you literally want to do is import everything so import Express from Express uh you want to go ahead and import [ __ ] from [ __ ] uh course motor and all those stuff that we just did uh you can go ahead post your video here copy all this stuff this is how you want to go ahead whoops this is how you want to go ahead and import everything nice um what we will be doing as well is gri [ __ ] is going to be mongus [ __ ] we will be using it later on we will be um this is literally the storage that we will be uh adding our images to okay next up uh what we always do is line out the whole app so we will have an app config uh we will have middle Wares oh yep we will have some DB config it's going to be brutal today and we will need um API routes nice and we want to have a listen part okay so let's actually cover all these stuff so app config is for now it's just going to uh it's really create the instance and Define the port where the application is going to run at next up we will have the metal Wares so first thing first we will have the body parser which will literally uh parse everything into Json format so that we will be able to make rest requests and we will have nice Json response and we are also using the course headers just there okay perfect um and let's actually create our first very first API uh request and that is going to be a routes nice uh so we want so what here happens is whenever I'm calling the app uh with a get method I'm going to show everything to you guys on the rout so there is no no endpoint just the API itself and that will fire off a function which has a request and a response uh property uh then what we want to do is set the response status to um 200 which means in server side language it means okay and then we want to go ahead and send back whoops uh hello world world nice and I think uh a bracket was gone and now I think we should be good but for some reason we are not um okay nice yeah so this is how the full line is going to look like okay awesome and we also want to go ahead and make the up listen which we will be able to do by say app. listen and that is where we pass in the port that we uh defined uh up here so this thing so it literally we we could actually say 9,000 but we we uh we are saying for instead so we can literally go ahead and like set it the way we want to and so yep and let's fire off a console log which will just give us an idea of where everything if everything is going right so this time I'm not using quotation marks I'm using backx which is on the United States keyboard it's right next to number one uh and on the British keyboard it's next to zed nice and guess what David we just got another donation rash Nish Kumar Gupta say hey thank you so much love you guys and I was not spamming a thank you man I appreciate you sometimes we just see repeated messages so we have to you know clear out the chat block a few people we want to keep it so that everybody can have a good learning environment but we really appreciate your donation man thank you so much thank you a lot yeah yeah um so let's get back to the code so what we want to type in here is basically like listening on local host and you can literally like add in with the string connation the actual Port so that's pretty much setting up our very first API it's I mean lots of stuff is not even needed here like all this stuff um but yeah we we will be just adding those anyways we will be using all of these stuff later on nice so we could literally make the app uh listen okay perfect and let's actually fire it up so I'm just going to go ahead and say um I think it's FB back in nice perfect and I'm going to say node Manon server.js oh okay it even found with chaos okay nice so it's actually running and I'll be opening up a thing called Postman which is a nice little app uh that we can use to uh to call the uh to make requests so I'm going to closing up everything here all these mess and I'm just going to go ahead and type in Local Host and 9,000 and I think I can zoom into this one one as well uh is it easy to read Frankie yeah now it's better perfect and because it says hello world that's how we know everything is working fine so let's give it an air horn actually we have our first API let's get it first API nice yeah exactly okay so next up what we want to do is let's go back to mongod DB uh during this time sorry my hair during this time uh our cluster got set up and now let's go uh oops I hit the wrong button so you want to press connect and you and you want to press uh connect connect your application nice and just copy this thing and let's hide it and inside of uh DB config you definitely want to go ahead and create a const [ __ ] U and and actually go ahead and paste this thing inside of here but notice that it has this password thing which is not the password that we had this is why you needed to save the password when I said we need it so you want to go ahead and and paste your password inside of there boom oh oh damn okay um I'm pressing buttons all the way boom uh so that's my password right now and for the DB name I actually like to I'd like to call it Facebook DB I think it's pretty descriptive right okay now what you need to do basically we will create two different kind of connections um but it's basically it's going to be almost the same the only thing that we will be doing differently is first we need to save it into a variable and we are using the create connection function and the other one is just simply connecting so whenever the server is starting in up we will be uh creating a connection and this is what we will be using for the GS storage and the other one is going to be like a general connection uh for saving the posts uh there is a bit of difference between these but I just don't want to go into it because it's uh super super hard to understand um so now let's go ahead and actually initialize uh let's actually say that whenever um let's actually uh say that once the first connection is done uh so we we were able to set it up we want a console log DB connected and we want to create a GFS um which we actually need to uh say we actually need to initialize here what's a GFS so GFS is going to be grid FS uh and gr FS is I think it's GD file system it's basically a file system for mongod DB so what happens is it's actually it's normally it's created for files that are larger than 16 uh MB but we would just use this for every single file uh and because normally you could use the binary way and the base 64 code for actually saving images but that's like crazy hardcore and you just don't want to do that uh this is a much simpler uh way to do it right um and what you want to do is so when so it's initialized you want to create the grid and the connection uh DB is uh going to be in side of here and we will pass in the mongus [ __ ] so and the great collection so the collection where we want to save all these images uh is going to be images right and one thing so grid FS storage is literally um saving stuff in like 200 kilobyte of chunks right and that's how we are actually saving it and we will just put it together uh when we're retrieving stuff okay and the other thing we need to uh have to set this thing up finally is is creating the storage so it's going to be new grid FS storage with the URL of [ __ ] URI which we have up here and the file so it's kind of like when we create the um this schema for this for the files and we're doing the exact same stuff here as well so we will have a file name uh which we are concatenating out of uh the word image a dash and the date now and the actual extension of the file and the other one is going to be a file info uh which is going to be consist of the file name and the bucket name which is images as we are saving our stuff into the images collection so pretty much the file is going to be whatever type of image right that we're putting in yeah exactly exct I mean it literally could accept videos as well okay so yep and we're just going to resolve it with this stuff nice uh and the upload instance is going to be this um motor so whenever we are uploading a file to uh to this uh server it's going to be using this storage to store it immediately without asking any questions so this gives us our next API route which is going to be this thing uh for Simplicity I'm just going to delete that so whenever we are calling the app with a post method on the SL upload SL image and point and we attach a file which we need to do in a bit of a different way than we just normally create a Json file uh it will fire off a request response uh callback function and we just literally just send back the file and all the details so let's try it out very quickly um inside of here so upload uh image I think yeah that's the thing we want to have and whenever we are using um what's called it Postman you want to go to the body you want to go to form data set the text to file actually and what you want to go ahead and select is um I have a couple of images over here so I'm just going to go use this uh profit which JavaScript logo um yep and it's going to be inside of there and if it's working perfectly and I hope it does when I send it oh because I'm getting it let's go what is happening un unexpected field okay here comes the debu session hey ready for that let's get it yeah so we are expecting the file right um let's see what the terminal says actually let's restart nice nice DB connected perfect um so we're actually okay I know what happened so what happened is that I didn't give a name for the field and we are actually expecting the file to be file coming in the file name uh file name field so the that should be a field which has a file name and that's where our file will be nice okay so add file let's send it again and now it's taking longer so it's good and these are literally the stuff that we had okay uh let's just uh see what's going on field name file right original name original name it was image.png it was a 7 bit image uh it was a PNG file uh it gave them random ID which is some mongod DB stuff don't worry about it and the new F name is this stuff right so this is the uh with with the date string uh all this stuff we don't need to really worry about it um there is some lot of uh nice stuff going on here if you want to spend time finding it out go ahead but it's just not relevant for today's build oh my God we're doing it for such a long time yeah it's a marathon we've been here a while yeah oh Jesus it's actually 1 a.m. here oh wow yeah 4M here yeah yeah yeah I actually have my I have this computer set to uh Los Angel time now I'm I'm working with you guys so I I just want to know what the time oh my God I have a call with Alex in less than half an hour oh wow that's okay no sleep tonight yeah exactly ah sleep is for for the week for humans yeah okay next up um what the usual stuff that we always do is actually what we want to do is have a schema for our database right so what that it's going to be it's like uh post model. JS right it's basically we are creating a uh database model so what we are doing here is let's type it up so we are importing [ __ ] uh from whoops uh mango right uh and we are going to be creating a uh post model uh which is going to be a [ __ ] do [ __ ] schema and this is where we Define all the fields so we will have a user which is going to be a string we will have an image name name I'll tell you why uh we need this so much but we need it uh that's going to be a string of course uh text which is literally going to be whatever the uh person wants the text of the uh post so that's going to be string again we are going to be saving the Avatar uh so that we can so whenever the person logs in with Google which is yet to come um we will be uh saving the the Avatar to the database so that when we refresh the application and render out everything again we will see the nice Avatar going on okay and the last but not least the time stamp whoops which is going to be a string as well and we need to export Rec it yep what's up all of them strings yeah everything everything is strings that that's the easiest way to go about it honestly oops um made a typo I mean there are all these data types but string is the easiest so we will be exporting a [ __ ] model right and we need to uh give the collection name here where we want to say it so it's going to be post it always plural uh this is something you need to watch out and we were actually danging it with sunny for minutes uh that mongodb pluralizes all the connection names so the best thing is to Define them plural uh by default and we are actually adding the post model as the model to it nice so we pretty much have it let's actually go back here and import that too so we will be importing uh DB post I think um oops h no actually we will import [ __ ] post and we will be uh importing the post model uh .js file whoops oh my God okay uh so down here we now what we want to do is literally just save a post um and what we will be doing uh when we save these stuff is we go ahead uh save the image first into the storage into the images collection and afterwards uh we will be going ahead and saving the image name with the post to to another collection so that way we will have track of everything so which image uh goes with which post right so that's what we will be doing just now so let's go ahead and create an app toop post on the um upload whoops upload slash poost and will fire off a request response uh callback function and inside of here what you want to do is basically save uh whatever comes in the request body and you can go ahead and conso log it but I'll just not do it uh for now and this is where we call uh the uh mod that we just created right so you can go back and see what's up here and we will be creating a new uh document inside of the collection with the DB post or we could literally pass in request body inside of here Buton yeah and if there is an error we want to set the response status to 500 which means internal server error that means something's went wrong or else you want to go ahead and set it to one which means created that means it was successfully created and everything is up and running and good um so yeah that's pretty much the uploading uh procedure and yeah actually let's go ahead and stretch everybody because let's let's get the energy High guys I know it's been it's been a while but you know sometimes you need to stretch a little bit so that your mind can work even a little bit more exactly yeah yeah yeah H we've been live about four hours almost 3 hours and 50 minutes thank you for the 100 concurrent viewers that we have right now it's actually about 200 if we're counting Facebook but 100 on on YouTube thank you guys for sticking out this is this is NI that's so awesome thanks a lot guys yep thank you guys yeah okay nice perfect um so what we want to do now is actually uh retrieve all the data that we have inside of here okay so how do we do that so we need to draw a bit of a process here so I think yeah this is how I open up the uh whiteboard so what you want to do is basically save the image then uh save the post with the uh whoops with image name and oh damn okay save image then save post with image name this is necessary because you can only r retrieve the image if you literally uh adding the um name of the image at the end of the endpoint right so we will be retrieving the post first and grab the image name and then retrieve uh the image uh the image itself so was it kind of followable uh uh Frankie could you understand it so you retrieve the post you retrieve the image of the post and then you retrieve the name of what is it the text the the actual post or the image uh no so actually how so we need to filter down okay so because we are saving the posts and the uh the images into two different collections we have to keep track of which image goes with which post right so that's why we need to save the name next to the post so that we will be able to uh filter uh using the name right so first we get back all the posts and we go over them one by one check out which image go uh uh goes to which post and then retrieve those images one by one and snap it next to the post when we are rendering it out does it make sense I I see yes okay perfect aw awesome so what we will be doing now is first let's create the uh post retrieving endpoint which is going to be app.get right I'm going to scroll down a bit uh and we will be saying a retrieve and post and oops and we will of course request response as always and here what we want to do is first get everything back from the uh database and second sort everything uh in a descending order um based on the date right or or the actual time stamp and then throw it back to the front end and that will do uh the conversion and all those kind of stuff so what you want to do do is [ __ ] post uh find and because we're not adding any kind of filtering inside of here so we could literally add filters in here but we're not doing that because we want everything to be sent back so if there's an error uh we're going to make the call fail and if there's data then here we go so if error let's handle that oh error um let's set the res oops response uh status to 500 and send back the error so that we will be able to debug what's up uh nice else and this is uh where the interesting part comes in we will need to sort the data and this is literally snipp of code that I found on the internet today so we will need to sort the data based on the time stamp right so that's uh kind of it so it's funny because the time stamp is it's kind of like a string right exactly that's how it looks in the back end but once it's converted like you said to the front end then you can actually see what is the UTC time zone that we chose exactly actually it kind of knows kind of knows the difference between where you're at yeah like like the time stamp so even if it's string it still knows the difference yeah which one is bigger and which one's not I don't know how I mean literally I got this code from uh got this nippet from the internet actually I think we will be doing uh a couple of twitch sessions when we are like preparing and then I can like share you all these insights like how I go on internet find stuff how I debug and all the all the stuff that you actually see here but it's going to be official that I'm that I'm preparing right it's actually pretty cool man yeah I've heard a lot of people wanting to know you know the whole workflow of how we make these projects kind of like exactly how they are all organized and really like you said the resources that you use to build them so that's awesome exactly exactly like guys actually if you like the idea drop a comment and let us know because then we can show it to kazy and then we can just fire the project up ASAP yep drop a coming guys we're excited for that exactly yeah yeah I'm pumped and what you want to do now uh is literally uh create the filter um filtering endpoint that will just throw back the image uh to the front it right okay so what we will be doing is saying app.get and let's say retrieve um it's going to be images and and single because we are uh retrieving a single image and don't forget to add the quod Mark around it um and we will also have of course have a request and the response in the cobc function and inside of here what we will be firing off is the gridfs find one function oh no it's going to be the G the files because inside of files that's where we want to find one find one file that will uh that actually has the file name uh so remember uh when we created it this is what we are searching for so the file name is um is equals the request. query do name now I know this is already getting like crazy I will show it I will demo it right after uh I've built this part okay so if there's an error handle it if we get file that's cool uh and let's actually go ahead and do the error handling as usual so response status 500 nice and send error perfect and else boom so else we want to check if the file is actually the file that we want so if it's like an actual file so if there's no file or something um or the file length is zero we just want to go ahead and say 404 and file not found however if we found the file we will create a read stream which is essentially like reading the file out of the rast storage and we will go ahead and grab the file and like like just push it back what's happening here let's go ahead and find it out so now that we have it inside of here uh let's actually go ahead and create a new one uh Rich which is going to be retrieve images and single and what was that query once again so that's going to be name and that's where I want to put the uh the file name right so I'm expecting to see the pwj logo um when I hit return and oops here we go oh wow nice so this is literally pushing the file back so we will actually be calling this link inside of uh the post file right okay so with that done um for now we are done with the back end let's go back and let's actually Implement what we have just done but first let's actually deploy this stuff so that we don't have to worry about like Local Host and not Local Host and all those kind of stuff so let's go to hu.com and and I don't know yeah I I have I have enough stuff okay um so inside of here I'll just say Facebook M um clone and live nice okay create uh you can do it just uh just that simple and I've already logged into my heru CLI if you haven't or you don't know what this is I recommend going uh onto this uh wo onto this page and whatever you got um even if you have a Windows or Mac I uh oops not this one I recommend installing the CLI this way uh not with any of the fancy Stu up here because uh I think it's a lot better and once you're done you're just going to go ahead log in the CLI CD inter your project initialize a git repository but because we have done that I'm just going to copy this part and actually create go back in here and set the uh remote git right so this is what I've uh pasted in here and it's done and what we got here is uh yeah so literally just copy paste all stuff next up we will do a g commit so get add do nice so we will see get status um all these files changed and actually added and we will be committing so get uh am and we will say um almost done and perfect and notice that all the changes like all this stuff stuff like went back to White and what we will be doing now is basically say k push Heroku Master boom and that will essentially go ahead and push everything to Heroku hey yep first part of deployment dude that Des an air horn you love these horen you got to celebrate exactly and what I like to do is actually uh watch the herac logs as well you can just do that by typing a her/ tail and once it says starting to up that's when you know things are ready so uh whoops this is three second yeah and this is the link that we have we can literally go ahead and go in here like got the hello world back like uh super easily nice and we can try it out with this uh part of the link as well like check it on uh right after it just uh remove the double slash and here we go so it works and now it's live it's crazy and and let's actually go back to where is yeah this is the front so let's actually close the back end for now just got a sale man let's get it hey nice beautiful perfect who do we welcome welcome Ceno sorry it's Carol that was the email so Carol asedo welcome welcome to the community thank you so much for joining really appreciate hey welcome welcome nice so what we kind of want to do is go ahead and inside of the front end you oops uh inside of actually the source you want to go ahead and create an xjs file and before we go any further you need to install a dependency which will be uh the AOS of course so mpm install xos and hopefully it's going to be fast so axios is literally letting you to make like rest requests pretty much let's actually go ahead and type your import xos from axios nice and and what we will be doing is create um an instance right so we will be just simply creating an instance which will be yeah so x. create and inside of here we will add the base URL which we have just created which is going to be this one and and let's remove the Slash from the end nice and oops um we will just go ahead and Export default the instance boom so now we have our axal instance done uh let's go ahead and so what are we doing here exactly we're so exactly um axios is it's kind of like fetch okay right so fetch is lit making uh requests to API um but because I mean fetch is like the more beginner stuff we want to go with axios and axios is like a more professional uh thing literally and we are just setting the base URL and outside of here we will say something like A.G which is literally mean which literally means that we we want to trigger this instance and let's go with a get uh function and the endpoint is going to be uh upload slash image and that way with just this line of code and a couple uh more like when we actually add the image but just this line of code we can uh literally Poe the image up to the database and with otherwise with fetch you would need to uh go go with the whole uh whole. link slash upload uh image and then you will need to uh say like this is like the body and all those kind of stuff so it's just uh making the whole thing like into one little instance and then we can just reuse this stuff again okay feed let's go to feed um hold on so inside the feed um yo David just as a because kind of an as an approximation how much do you think we have left off of this build in hours or time um I mean we could make it fast because kind of like all this knowledge uh so using axios using all this stuff is actually up uh in here and we are pretty much just reusing stuff so we could actually say that uh um from now on it could be a homework um and just wrap it up right here because the new new part is literally uh inside of server. is uh saving the image which is already covered everything else can be done uh using a couple of videos with the uh with the m builds so if if if we need to wrap it up fast we can go ahead and do it now yeah actually cuz we are a little bit time sensitive today we are getting few things built here in this studio we're going to get the TV mount and everything but we'll make sure you guys get the whole knowledge that we are you know teaching you guys and as David said we're going to leave a little bit of homework for you guys it's pretty much what we've shown you yeah yeah exactly so we may we literally uh showed you the new stuff you can now just go ahead and reuse everything that is in here and everything is going to be working okay I think we can go ahead and wrap it up here then and um you can make the improvements on the studio and oh my God it's almost 500 p.m y cool so you want to continue this build in another live is that the plan what's what's better I mean can that part as well or we could do the whole thing once again um without the glitches and all those kind of stuff okay we will figure it out later let's actually wrap it up for now awesome I think and then uh we will figure it out how we will be sharing all the knowledge beautiful okay so let's wrap it up today um that that's a lot of work that we did today connecting the back end the front end all the front end functionalities are there guys David did a great great job doing that explaining that and we also ran into a lot of technical issues actually which just makes us better at coding it just makes it a little bit more flavorful you know sometimes things don't go as expected so this is just part of life man but but it's cool anything that you want to share before or you want to explain before so that it's easier for them to have this build up to this point I think um guys literally like whenever we uh added like hardcoded data you just want to go ahead and uh and snap it out and change it with some kind of axio schol or you can use fatch if you want if you're more comfortable with that um and other than that that's kind of it awesome I think it it can be uh done with any other uh with with the help of other videos cool yep we'll continue this build on another video this week guys let's show them the the finished demo yeah okay so the finished demo is literally this thing and what what I want you guys to do is like hook up this button uh to the uploading functionality first save the image retrieve uh and you will get back all the data because we have already done that check out the um uh file name uh save it somewhere and then go ahead and
