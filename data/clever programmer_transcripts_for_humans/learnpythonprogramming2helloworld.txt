00:00 - - Okay guys, back to where we left off.
00:02 - So, we just did some
simple stuff in Python,
00:06 - right, we can print stuff by doing this.
00:09 - And then it prints it out to the screen.
00:11 - That's cool.
00:13 - Now, what we wanna do
is we want to take it
00:15 - to a little bit of a next level.
00:17 - I want you to come up here
and select "New File."
00:22 - This brings up this file, here.
00:25 - Let's go back to our other screen.
00:28 - And let us simply put
this to the right side.
00:33 - Let's put this to the left side.
00:36 - And, what I wanna do is I want
to write a few things here,
00:39 - like "print hello,"
00:42 - "print monkeys eat bananas all the time."
00:50 - And then I want to say-
00:53 - And notice how I'm putting these quotes.
00:55 - We will learn a little
bit more about that later.
00:57 - And then I can say "print five times 25."
01:02 - Okay.
01:06 - And I am gonna run this.
01:08 - So I'm gonna save this first.
01:11 - You can save it anywhere you would like.
01:14 - Let's, for our purposes,
let's save it in our desktop.
01:18 - Or, let's do one better and let's go here
01:22 - and let's call this "practice exercises"
01:26 - and we will save it in here, printing.
01:31 - And I'm going to go to "Run"
and hit "Python Shell."
01:37 - And here you're going to see what happens.
01:38 - I'm gonna say "Run" and
actually "run module."
01:41 - So I'm going to say "run module."
01:42 - That just means run this whole
thing that we just wrote.
01:45 - So let's run it, let's
check out what happens.
01:48 - Boom.
01:49 - On the left hand side,
it ran our entire file.
01:52 - On the left hand side,
01:54 - everything you type in
01:55 - (keyboard clicking)
01:58 - gives you the result right away.
01:59 - So you can write four
times eight, 20 times 6,
02:03 - but on the right hand side,
02:05 - notice when I press enter nothing happens.
02:07 - So, you're kind of writing a story here,
02:10 - that's how I like to think of it.
02:12 - You're writing kind of a novel.
02:13 - And this is almost you having
a conversation with Python.
02:17 - You're like, "Hey Python, what's up?"
02:19 - or in Python's language,
eight times eight.
02:23 - And Python is like "64."
02:25 - Here, Python is not listening to you.
02:27 - You write out your entire
whatever you want to write,
02:30 - and then you send it over to Python,
02:32 - and then Python responds to all of that.
02:36 - Almost like you're
sending an Email to Python
02:39 - and Python is sitting there,
02:40 - and once it sees your Email
it'll type stuff back to you.
02:45 - Okay, let's run it again
just to check what happens.
02:48 - And I will run, and you
can see that it runs
02:51 - all of that at the same time.
02:54 - So, what I wanna do is
02:57 - I wanna give you guys a little problem.
02:59 - And the problem is: How would you print
03:01 - "Hello World?"
03:03 - And I want to be able to
test this for you guys.
03:06 - So what I have done is I have
set up something kind of cool.
03:10 - I want you to go on,
03:12 - open a new tab,
03:14 - I want you to go to
03:14 - clever programmer dot com.
03:16 - And once you're here,
03:18 - I want you to click on
"learn Python for beginners."
03:21 - Notice that it's free.
03:23 - So, simply go to that.
03:25 - And here I've put together a
little exercise for you guys.
03:28 - So, once you start this course,
03:30 - you can feel free to watch
all of this on YouTube,
03:33 - it's available for free.
03:35 - If you want, you can
also go to my website.
03:39 - And here it'l give you a little
progress bar and everything,
03:42 - you can comment and I can
respond to you as well.
03:44 - And here, this is where I'll also put
03:46 - all of the exercises.
03:48 - So if you guys want to
follow along this course
03:50 - and do the exercises,
this is where you can come
03:52 - and find them.
03:53 - So let's click exercise one and start.
03:56 - Now, notice you have a quiz here.
03:58 - It says "How do you
print out "Hello, World!"
04:01 - So, I'm now going to
answer that for you here.
04:04 - Although I'm sure you can figure out.
04:06 - And we want it to look
exactly like this in Python 3.
04:10 - Just a little bit about
Python 3 versus Python 2,
04:13 - is if you do this in Python 3,
04:17 - you're gonna get an error.
04:18 - So, let's just try it out
on the left hand side.
04:20 - Let's say "print 10."
04:23 - You can see that we get an error.
04:25 - And if I do "print 10"
04:27 - I don't get an error.
04:29 - So in Python 3, this is the
correct way of doing it.
04:31 - In Python 2, you can do it just like this
04:35 - and it actually will not
give you an error, okay?
04:37 - Just something for you to know.
04:39 - So here, I want you to
select the correct answer.
04:42 - And another thing I made for you guys is
04:44 - if you click this link,
04:48 - what I've put together is so simple.
04:52 - You'll have to sign up,
it'll be really short.
04:55 - And once you're done
doing that, just click on
04:56 - exercise one.
04:57 - And on the right hand side,
04:59 - you see that I want you to
print out "Hello, World!"
05:03 - Alright, so now that you're here,
05:05 - let's type in something
like "print 25 times 63"
05:10 - and let's run it.
05:12 - It gives me 1575.
05:13 - Great, let's hit submit.
05:14 - Let's see what happens.
05:16 - Oh, whoops.
05:17 - It says "Output mismatch"
and you've failed
05:20 - to answer it correctly.
05:24 - So you can click "What's wrong?"
05:26 - and it'll kind of tell
you what the answer is,
05:28 - or you can hit submit anyway,
05:30 - and then it might also tell
you what the answer is.
05:32 - But, I want you to try to figure it out.
05:34 - And I'm sure you probably already have.
05:36 - So I'm not going to tell
you what the answer is,
05:38 - but once you write the correct answer,
05:40 - it'll give you a little green thumbs up
05:41 - and say "Hey, good job, you got it."
05:43 - So now I want you try it,
05:46 - and I'll see you in the next video.
