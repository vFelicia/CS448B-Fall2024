With timestamps:

00:00 - this can be command-v okay manager we're
00:04 - gonna come and enter oh yeah I didn't
00:06 - check it the last time
00:07 - all right there you go
00:14 - most important part of coding with your
00:18 - girlfriend's is taking kisi breaks
00:20 - that's right the most important part
00:22 - yeah now with that said Kitty rate let's
00:27 - jump to it
00:30 - what's up guys this is Kazi here from
00:32 - clever programmer calm i'm here today
00:34 - with my girlfriend and we're gonna be
00:35 - trying something new i'm here with
00:38 - what's up guys this is sugar siya great
00:55 - thanks
00:56 - so I'm here with sugar Shah so this is
00:59 - gonna be really interesting because
01:00 - gonna be a pro boxer trying to learn how
01:02 - to code alright so we're gonna we're
01:13 - gonna try to code with her let's see how
01:15 - far she gets and then we don't try we do
01:20 - we just do so we tried one time to code
01:24 - before on an airplane yeah but that was
01:27 - about it on a second so today we'll do
01:32 - it for like two seconds okay okay yeah
01:34 - yeah and we're gonna be capturing your
01:37 - live reaction to coding okay this is
01:40 - actually very kind of cool because then
01:42 - you can actually see it you know a week
01:44 - from now a month or a year from now
01:46 - credit code yeah and now my name is
01:49 - Amber Lee turtle that's right oh yeah
01:51 - we'll drop that as a link underneath the
01:53 - video so you guys can actually see that
01:55 - okay okay so let's get started okay now
02:00 - the first thing we're gonna do is we're
02:03 - gonna start drawing with a turtle you
02:05 - remember the turtle yeah okay so we're
02:07 - gonna learn visually this way you get to
02:10 - learn I get to learn and hopefully
02:11 - somebody who's watching this to learn
02:13 - yeah alright hopefully the turtle has a
02:15 - great time yeah and we're not gonna do
02:17 - it
02:18 - oh yeah and we're not gonna do it in a
02:20 - boring way yeah okay
02:22 - so let's start the first thing we're
02:24 - gonna do is like import the turtle okay
02:27 - what is that that's like basically we
02:29 - didn't have access to him now we have
02:31 - access to play with them yeah that's it
02:36 - alright I like animals baby yeah you do
02:39 - yeah okay I I like most animals every
02:45 - animal except my dog yeah that's true
02:49 - okay just kidding I like him okay okay
02:57 - alright let's continue
02:59 - OOP dodged that one alright so let's
03:02 - create a let's create your turtle okay
03:06 - so let's go ahead and call it my
03:08 - underscore turtle so go ahead
03:09 - yeah type it okay my remember kids
03:13 - variables you don't have to put a space
03:15 - if you can't have spaces in there there
03:18 - you go uh and then you what you want to
03:21 - do is like my turtle yeah and then you
03:23 - want to set this variable to something
03:25 - so we're creating a variable okay this
03:26 - is gonna be like this is where the
03:28 - turtle is gonna be stored so we do this
03:32 - and then we put an equal sign equal a
03:34 - space space and now here we put like
03:38 - turtle turtle so this is like one of
03:40 - those weird
03:41 - ominous lines but this actually goes
03:45 - ahead and creates your turtle I think
03:47 - hopefully hopefully you think yeah but
03:51 - you are the king
03:53 - so let's hit run and see if we get any
03:55 - errors we didn't get any error so it
03:56 - looks like we did a good job great job
03:58 - baby
03:59 - okay now we start doing things with the
04:01 - turtle so remember we could move the
04:04 - turtle forward to the left or backward
04:08 - right so let's try to move the turtle
04:11 - forward okay okay that's fine we'll
04:15 - figure it out right now so type in my
04:18 - underscore turtle so that's like your
04:20 - turtle and then can I just click E yep
04:23 - you can click and then I'll just go and
04:24 - now dot dot and now you can say forward
04:28 - forward yep and put in parenthesis yep
04:33 - and just type in like 100 the word or
04:37 - the number yep and do command enter so I
04:43 - can hit room so basically just hit run
04:45 - that command enter his run on replica
04:49 - this thing that we're using so okay so
04:51 - you just went forward right yeah now
04:55 - what we want to do is you want to make a
04:57 - square so if we want to make it square
04:59 - like let's sectionally just learn how to
05:00 - turn him for a second okay yeah so the
05:03 - two turns to type my turtle again and
05:05 - then dot yeah just hit enter oh really
05:09 - yep dot dot and let's go make him turn
05:13 - right 90 degrees so do right right and
05:16 - then parenthesis uh-huh oops that's not
05:18 - a friend Francie's 90 that's it and then
05:22 - I'm gonna hit command and direct like
05:24 - yep that's it
05:25 - [ __ ] yes oh he turn I saw him now like
05:29 - you breakdance on his head yes that's
05:31 - right it looks like he's doing like yeah
05:34 - yeah I forget what they're all windy
05:37 - papa where they're having a competition
05:38 - are you serious no I think it's just I
05:41 - couldn't think of it actually
05:43 - are you serious windmill dance move
05:45 - let's look it up you know oh wow that's
05:55 - it you're actually right now was it yeah
05:58 - that's actually what the turtle [ __ ]
06:00 - did yeah I did a windmill okay now let's
06:02 - make it okay now so you have this and
06:07 - now I'm gonna challenge you okay baby I
06:10 - like a good challenge just using these
06:16 - two commands this is all you know you
06:17 - don't know anything else right now using
06:19 - those two can you go ahead and make a
06:21 - square can you make him make a square
06:24 - this is tricky you shouldn't get this
06:26 - because we haven't made a square yet I'm
06:30 - just gonna you do it you do it go ahead
06:32 - okay and you can take a few tries you
06:34 - have to get it right now I'm gonna do
06:36 - I'm gonna do that
06:38 - my underscore turtle uh-huh dot I'm
06:40 - gonna go forward again you can see
06:42 - already turning frenzy
06:46 - okay Iran perfect okay great he went
06:49 - forward yeah we have very important this
06:51 - and that yeah that's it and it's very
06:54 - important like all of us test your code
06:56 - incrementally so what she just did is
06:58 - actually something very intelligent she
07:00 - doesn't even know what she did she was
07:02 - practicing it but every line of code
07:04 - she's actually writing she's hitting run
07:06 - intuitive that's really really that's
07:10 - really good this call for a kisi break
07:17 - [Music]
07:20 - okay excuse me my way about busy coding
07:23 - here now okay we're gonna make him do a
07:26 - windmill again all right oh no he's
07:28 - messing up okay keep going don't pay
07:30 - attention to me well you're fluffing my
07:32 - hair come to me hard not to pay
07:34 - attention when you're flipping my hair
07:35 - okay now we're gonna do my okay uh-huh
07:39 - we just click on it cuz Jess it okay and
07:42 - now we're gonna go right again okay
07:45 - we're making all right
07:46 - turns and right angles actually to make
07:49 - this turn that's right okay so we're
07:51 - gonna go over that's right okay we're
08:00 - gonna we're gonna run it come on enter
08:04 - uh-huh and we're gonna see he did a
08:06 - windmill beautiful so now we're gonna
08:08 - mentally check that code that's my baby
08:13 - running so now you don't have to keep on
08:15 - typing it over you can copy and paste it
08:17 - okay just like highlight this if you uh
08:22 - huh and then just two lines Nancy the
08:26 - copy I'm gonna command C to copy and
08:28 - then like go somewhere and then command
08:30 - V to paste
08:31 - [Music]
08:34 - beautiful I was wondering why did they
08:36 - put V for paste I never understand
08:39 - that's actually stupid well the only
08:42 - thing that I can ever understand is like
08:44 - it's close to C so there's like a man C
08:46 - command B but it should be command P
08:48 - like it really should be command P buy a
08:51 - copy and paste but copying them yeah
08:53 - okay now that's gonna make three sides
08:59 - so we need to do that again okay so it's
09:02 - already copied so we're just going to
09:03 - return and make sure you paste it and
09:06 - hit enter oh yeah I didn't check it the
09:15 - last time all right there you go
09:17 - oh I heard update is weird
09:21 - wow this calls for a kiss here eh
09:28 - [Music]
09:31 - that's really really great I did it good
09:34 - job okay
09:36 - that's yeah and Bachman break yeah
09:42 - thanks
09:43 - he teaches me coding and I teach you in
09:46 - boxing know what we should do in between
09:48 - our coding sessions like why we do a
09:51 - kisi break or something like that we can
09:53 - also do like a like holding the myths
09:56 - and like boxing break and then cut back
09:57 - to the training we could be switching
10:04 - back and forth between the two because
10:07 - pivot II inspires brain sexual like
10:17 - that's an appropriate for encoding video
10:20 - yes all right
10:21 - not when it comes to pop-up - that's
10:23 - right it's way too obvious
10:33 - so what I you to you you have to do it
10:35 - like real cool just like no but not not
10:39 - just too much like all I do is I like to
10:42 - be very subtle so I'll display I know
10:44 - and that's so sexy and that's my
11:00 - Nine's okay I always just say the words
11:02 - wink-wink nudge-nudge
11:03 - alright now that we have made a square
11:05 - these lines of code made the square
11:07 - right yes okay
11:08 - from line 6 to 16 yeah we can actually
11:11 - do is we can give this thing an 8 and
11:19 - then we can just refer back to that name
11:21 - so for example we can call this thing we
11:24 - can call it like turtle Square maker
11:26 - yeah and then whenever we say whatever
11:29 - it doesn't matter but if we create
11:30 - turtle square maker and hit enter it'll
11:32 - make a square every time okay so what do
11:36 - you want to call instead of that I want
11:38 - to call it um we're now entering the
11:41 - world of functions kids I want to call
11:43 - it
11:43 - silly square all right so here's what
11:47 - you're gonna do you're gonna set define
11:48 - d EF not full so just do D yet and the
11:51 - hit space most def so yeah
11:53 - space and then do whatever you set silly
11:57 - square but it has to be one word okay
12:00 - and yeah we like alliteration open
12:02 - closed paren what there that's it okay
12:06 - all the way and at the end of that make
12:09 - sure you put a colon go outside of that
12:12 - how do I do that yep :
12:15 - all right now it is that a colon yeah
12:17 - this is a colon that's correct goal from
12:19 - line 6 to 16 drag it off from line 6 to
12:22 - 16 I'm gonna drag from line 6 to 16 and
12:26 - then just hit tab to indent it beautiful
12:31 - now hit command enter come on
12:33 - okay now nothing should happen nothing
12:36 - happened all we've done is they've just
12:38 - given this a name close to the square
12:40 - yeah in other words we've actually
12:41 - created in technical terms and nerdy
12:43 - terms we've created a function okay now
12:46 - whenever we call that function a
12:49 - function is that a song yeah we just got
12:51 - you're trying to function yeah baby come
12:53 - on efore tea and stuff I don't really
12:55 - know those attached the guys you know
12:58 - Drake and stuff all those okay so silly
13:08 - square is a function silly square is a
13:10 - function all right and you can call that
13:12 - function by just saying its name that's
13:15 - it so if you say its name Oh silly
13:17 - square if you say it's the thing with
13:20 - open closed paren ya know call it this
13:22 - sees why do you just say for in it's too
13:24 - much work so yes do you all nerds say
13:27 - prayer no the cool people said friend I
13:29 - think it sounds like parental parental
13:32 - choice okay so let's call the function
13:34 - let's do it let's call the function now
13:35 - how I just said I spoken not you got to
13:38 - type it in silly oh there he goes
13:44 - and to open close all right what do
13:48 - ideas vary
13:50 - there it is and now hit command enter oh
13:56 - my god there he goes the silly square
13:59 - yep and what would happen if you want to
14:01 - make so let's say that we do my turtle
14:05 - dot forward again uh-huh by 100 and
14:08 - let's say that after it travels 100 oh
14:12 - actually that was what I think you want
14:15 - to go let's do that let's not turn him
14:18 - again right yeah you see what I'm what I
14:21 - kind of did or not you you went for it
14:24 - again I was gonna say up but it's just
14:26 - for it again yeah so you see how when I
14:28 - was so voice instead of turning him
14:30 - because he was turning right here yes so
14:33 - then so all I did was remove this line
14:35 - now he doesn't turn right there anymore
14:38 - he doesn't straight we took one windmill
14:42 - in turn so instead he stopped facing
14:46 - north and then we went short 100 so he
14:49 - continued north
14:50 - that's right now we're making a
14:51 - skyscraper okay so we've made one square
14:54 - now can we make another square how would
14:57 - we make another square if we wanted to
14:59 - like if we want to make a square right
15:00 - here yeah we'll just repeat okay so do
15:03 - it okay but I can't just put silly
15:07 - square why not well you already have one
15:12 - guy up there then he's gonna go like all
15:14 - the way back today but okay but would
15:17 - that make a square yeah okay let's do it
15:19 - here we go
15:20 - operation silly squares and dirt
15:23 - open-close open-close oops and hit
15:29 - command okay let's see what's gonna
15:32 - happen guys he goes up oh my god he went
15:35 - way too far because he starts off by for
15:38 - room 100 okay so you made another square
15:41 - yeah but that's there's a space in the
15:43 - square what space well yeah so so okay
15:49 - so what we can do is I can remove this
15:50 - line and then that space won't be there
15:52 - anymore I can just do it like that right
15:58 - and then you can call it again and then
16:00 - yeah okay so every time you say silly
16:05 - square it goes through these lines of
16:07 - code then when you say silly square it
16:10 - goes through this line of code again all
16:11 - of these lines so now he's facing this
16:14 - riccati daily square he's gonna go this
16:16 - would give it a try see what okay let's
16:18 - give it a try guys silly square paren
16:22 - mm-hmm okay here we go he makes one
16:29 - silly square and goes up it makes my
16:31 - square and goes over I mean another
16:33 - silly square
16:35 - and what would happen if we did it one
16:37 - more time then here we go forward down
16:40 - and make another silly squared okay and
16:43 - then guys it's gonna be like we're
16:45 - making takes a cube like a window
16:47 - basically oh it's a window yeah so give
16:50 - it a try
16:51 - okay one more silly square and then we
16:56 - do the paren 1 squared done whoop
17:04 - another square done over 1 9 s squared 9
17:08 - down another square done okay
17:12 - guys we made a full window job great job
17:16 - ok so that's pretty dope you have so you
17:19 - pretty much got this figured out how
17:20 - does this feel so far for you to code
17:23 - this up and does this seem like
17:26 - something that's really really hard no
17:29 - it seems manageable
17:30 - it doesn't like stress me out and you
17:34 - know I get like technological anxiety
17:37 - yeah so it doesn't stress you out that
17:40 - much that's really good that's fun
17:42 - actually because you get this like you
17:44 - make something happen
17:45 - yeah that's kind of cool yeah yeah it's
17:48 - like pretty because if I like suck at
17:50 - art I mean I don't I don't know but like
17:52 - I feel I like drawing and stuff but I
17:55 - don't feel like something actually
17:57 - happens when I do it yeah
18:00 - but when you code even if you're coding
18:03 - for your first time you can actually
18:04 - make something happen
18:06 - yeah well I I think I like it cuz it's
18:09 - like like in boxing you don't get
18:11 - immediate results and nobody's you don't
18:13 - get immediate results so it's like
18:14 - satisfying because you get like you just
18:16 - type something really quick and like 1
18:18 - second later it's something's happening
18:20 - even like you made it do that right kind
18:22 - of empowering like it's true I [ __ ]
18:24 - did it
18:25 - that's true that's true and like just
18:27 - happens right away yeah and then you can
18:30 - see it if there's a mistake you fix it
18:31 - right away yeah yeah so you don't have
18:33 - to like like in boxing you have to go
18:35 - like review video and see what I did
18:37 - wrong in sparring
18:39 - stuff and then it takes a weeks to fix
18:41 - errors that are ingrained in me because
18:43 - I'm not a computer run so you can fix
18:45 - these things so fast I think that's cool
18:47 - yeah like even when I was when I went to
18:50 - Train ping pong like table tennis with
18:52 - my coach he actually said that it would
18:55 - actually be better if I hadn't been
19:01 - playing yeah
19:02 - because I had formed such poor habit I
19:05 - have it but there's no way to detect
19:07 - them sometimes there's no way to know
19:09 - and and the results are right of your
19:12 - skill developing takes so long yeah and
19:14 - you don't really see and experience
19:16 - anything kind of happening immediately
19:17 - another thing I don't know if you know
19:19 - but you could actually you could
19:21 - actually extend this link this over here
19:24 - to literally your mom and when she'd go
19:26 - sit she clicks the button run it like do
19:29 - that no way right so if you actually put
19:32 - color in there where it like fills up
19:34 - each square with like green color orange
19:37 - color red color or something you could
19:39 - send it to somebody or whoever it right
19:41 - and then hit it and then it'll like fill
19:43 - up those colors dad you know so it's
19:45 - like I feel that you could do a lot of
19:48 - these things really really quickly now
19:51 - that's good that you feel a little bit
19:53 - more confident how do you feel if how
19:57 - what did you feel like coding was and
20:00 - after doing this what does it feel like
20:02 - to you now hmm
20:04 - coding felt like alien language right
20:07 - like it's not real like how can you just
20:10 - make something later where do you even
20:13 - go to make something good
20:15 - like what how do you know like what to
20:17 - type in like how can you just put words
20:20 - and then the computer knows it action
20:21 - like I don't know right I can't I
20:24 - couldn't like grasp the concept yeah and
20:29 - it just seemed like especially for me
20:31 - somebody who doesn't even like I mean
20:34 - you know technology kind of like is
20:37 - overwhelming to me like even setting up
20:39 - like internet or capable or like
20:42 - something like you know like going
20:43 - through process of doing something it's
20:45 - like really stressful for me and but
20:49 - this was now now I like understand it
20:53 - more it's a lot of repetition which I
20:55 - like you guys like boxing training all
20:57 - that stuff is repetition yeah I love
20:59 - that and so I feel like you can learn as
21:02 - you go
21:03 - yeah yes now I see it's not alien
21:06 - language right yeah I you know because I
21:10 - see it in action
21:11 - yes yeah so now it's not so scary yep
21:14 - and now it was like a real thing yeah so
21:18 - still crazy to me it's like no mind boy
21:21 - still really crazy right yeah I'd like
21:23 - to think like this is just okay like all
21:26 - these lines just to make like this
21:27 - little window yeah like people make full
21:30 - like graphics and websites and like apps
21:34 - and like yeah it's like endless
21:38 - opportunities of stuff and like you can
21:41 - never stop learning right yeah
21:42 - crazy you can't you can keep going
21:45 - forever even you know another thing we
21:47 - can even do one time is like create a
21:49 - website together yeah we can create like
21:52 - a simple looking website yeah together
21:53 - but yeah such Illium alien-looking
21:57 - language in the start then you start
22:01 - getting used to it but you're right it's
22:02 - like a pet it's like patterning action
22:04 - once you start seeing it many more times
22:06 - but like all it's a function all I'm
22:08 - just calling a function it's like the
22:10 - same thing like that makes a square but
22:12 - we're here learning visually in teachers
22:16 - in school you know how they actually
22:17 - teach this yeah they teach it with
22:20 - [ __ ] math and numbers and formulas so
22:25 - for example if you are wrong here right
22:27 - and if you make a mistake
22:28 - yeah I don't even have to tell you your
22:30 - Square will loom
22:32 - yeah with a square right it will look
22:34 - like not something else he'll go in a
22:36 - wrong direction he'll go in the wrong
22:38 - direction right and so in that case
22:40 - we'll end up happening is you will
22:43 - instantly know whether that's right or
22:45 - wrong in school when it's some math
22:49 - formula or you're supposed to get some
22:51 - number you're not even gonna know you're
22:54 - wrong like instead of getting seven
22:56 - point eight six six six seven two three
22:59 - as your answer you'll get like five
23:02 - point two five six six as your answer
23:04 - and you'll be like huh why am I wrong I
23:07 - don't understand you see and literally
23:09 - like don't even understand how while
23:12 - you're talking about like using math to
23:14 - do this like I don't write this and
23:16 - itself is crazy then I mean how do you
23:18 - do what I don't know doing like all
23:20 - kinds of physics problems you know it's
23:22 - like if your mom weighs hundred and ten
23:23 - pounds and she falls off the [ __ ]
23:25 - plane how long will it take her to hit
23:27 - the floor yeah they don't actually give
23:28 - you a special price yeah but like
23:30 - similar you're not the idea similar it's
23:33 - like Oh a rock falls from the roof and
23:35 - the gravitational pull is like whatever
23:37 - and I don't know how to figure that out
23:40 - like I would have to look it up and I
23:41 - have to look up or how much gravity is
23:43 - and I would why do you need that for
23:44 - coding well because then what you can do
23:47 - is you can just put in like somebody's
23:49 - body weight and it'll instantly tell you
23:51 - how long it takes them to hit the floor
23:52 - or how long it is it's like so morbid
23:55 - but how long it takes that thing to hit
23:57 - the floor so you'd create this program
23:59 - though automatically like all this
24:01 - calculator you know for example if you
24:03 - want to check your like body mass index
24:05 - yeah or you want to check like what how
24:09 - much percentage body fat do I have well
24:11 - we can actually code up something
24:13 - religions like how would you figure it
24:15 - out normally what's the recipe to figure
24:17 - it out do you would tell me what's your
24:21 - body weight Yeah right never that's not
24:24 - none of that's accurate to test your
24:26 - body I know but like the normal formula
24:28 - it would to be something like you would
24:30 - give me your body weight then maybe
24:31 - you'd give me how much fat you have
24:33 - and then I give you back I'll like
24:36 - calculate it I'll go through these
24:37 - series of steps and I'll be like this is
24:39 - the body fat percentage yeah right well
24:41 - I could just have it caught it up so
24:43 - then as soon as you put in your body fat
24:45 - into it and then you put your weight it
24:47 - instantly just tell you yeah so you have
24:50 - to go through the process over and over
24:52 - again every single time that sounds
24:54 - terrible right but that's the boring way
24:58 - of how a lot easy chip the teaching
25:00 - numbers wouldn't it be cooler if they
25:02 - taught it where you went to like
25:07 - Instagram right and they were like well
25:10 - Instagram is actually made with code
25:12 - yeah when you hover over and the screen
25:14 - turns like that
25:15 - you got my followers good job baby thank
25:17 - you when you hover over like that that's
25:20 - actually somebody coded that in to be
25:24 - like oh when somebody hovers over show
25:26 - the number of likes and show the number
25:28 - of comments how cool right
25:29 - if I click into this somebody's coded it
25:33 - up so then it shows like my three
25:36 - hundred and seventy others right but if
25:38 - it's somebody who's really closely
25:41 - following Kazi then when they like it
25:43 - show their name next you see what I'm
25:46 - saying yeah so that's called a front-end
25:49 - user interface so it's like somebody's
25:51 - coding that up and if they're giving
25:55 - examples like that I soak so much cooler
25:57 - and if we're working on projects where
25:58 - we're building a clone of this you'll be
26:03 - like even I don't even if I don't
26:04 - understand every single line of code
26:07 - I get what we're doing and then you'll
26:09 - keep trying to work towards doing it
26:11 - versus this is a right formula that's
26:15 - not an answer you should get well
26:16 - especially for me because I'm an athlete
26:18 - and stuff like hands-on is way better
26:20 - like visual hands-on like learning
26:24 - through errors like this way and you're
26:26 - seeing it like way easier for me like
26:29 - doing a formula I'll quit before you
26:31 - write yeah that's a terrible way to
26:34 - teach I think well maybe not for some
26:36 - people I can't say that but like I don't
26:39 - learn that way I'm guessing most people
26:41 - that are like millennia
26:42 - and what's this new generation Gen X
26:45 - yeah yeah I don't know whatever they are
26:49 - these little [ __ ] um everybody
26:53 - is used to like everything visual and
26:55 - you know screens and all this stuff so
26:57 - like I don't think they're gonna learn
26:59 - that way you do yeah yeah I long as it's
27:04 - more physical and like everybody is a
27:05 - different learning style yeah you know
27:07 - for example for me my learning style is
27:11 - very different than yours yeah I can
27:14 - just sit down and focus for like 20
27:17 - hours and I have to take it serious
27:20 - after your rings but then that's but
27:23 - then you can also do 20 [ __ ] rounds
27:25 - of boxing and one you know or ten rounds
27:27 - of boxing in one session 18 to 20 right
27:30 - Christ so you can do that and keep going
27:35 - and stay focused on that over the course
27:37 - of months and years so everybody just a
27:42 - different learning style is very kinetic
27:44 - and it has to be respected your learning
27:46 - style has to be respected this [ __ ]
27:49 - system of the academic world where you
27:53 - have to learn the exact same way that
27:55 - like the other person has to learn the
27:56 - exact same way I have to learn like I
27:59 - remember I'd be sitting in a chemistry
28:00 - class and this old ass teacher she was
28:03 - trying to teach us something and she was
28:04 - terrible at her job like nobody ever
28:07 - learned anything from her I'm serious
28:09 - like you know and so I am like okay I
28:12 - can't learn from her so I opened up my
28:14 - laptop to learn on my own and take my
28:18 - own notes and she's like just what are
28:20 - you doing with the laptop she's like put
28:21 - the laptop away and I'm like like just
28:23 - watching porn man yeah I'm like I'm
28:27 - actually learning like I'm looking up
28:30 - the things yeah like supplementing if
28:32 - she's like it's not watching movies I
28:34 - like I'm not watching [ __ ] she stopped
28:37 - then I put it away and then it was like
28:40 - I couldn't learn from her she wouldn't
28:41 - let me learn yeah she just wanted us to
28:44 - all learn the same way and it's just
28:45 - [ __ ] yeah yeah and hey we will try
28:48 - to put you in a box and then and then
28:50 - it's frustrating you just don't want to
28:51 - do it anyway you're a boxer and you
28:53 - barely even watch
28:55 - you didn't even watch the Pacquiao fight
28:58 - don't forget last no but what I'm saying
29:01 - is that's great yeah like everybody is a
29:04 - different way to learn and think like
29:06 - you're not even learning from watching
29:08 - the fights you're just learning on your
29:09 - own in their own way of doing it with
29:11 - your coach and power and you became pro
29:15 - yeah I do watch some fights like to
29:18 - review stuff and like look at different
29:21 - styles but um mostly because I'm like so
29:25 - visual I don't really want somebody
29:27 - else's style stuck in my head in case it
29:29 - doesn't work for me mm-hmm which is why
29:32 - I mean that's not why I don't it's some
29:33 - busy which is I miss fight a lot yeah um
29:36 - but I yeah I learned more by tweaking my
29:40 - own style and like going through the
29:43 - motions and repetition yeah like
29:46 - hands-on repetition which is exactly
29:48 - this right well not this encoding the
29:52 - others um and then yeah like reviewing
29:56 - my own tape so that I'm like digesting
29:59 - and like visually seeing and fixing my
30:02 - own style in my own mistakes and like
30:05 - you do have to like study other fighters
30:08 - so you mean you can get inspiration from
30:10 - other places I do the same thing for
30:11 - acting I study other actors but at the
30:13 - end of the day like I don't want that to
30:15 - be my main source of inspiration or like
30:21 - I just don't want to like write you want
30:23 - to bring it from internal like yeah I
30:25 - don't want the external coming and I
30:27 - want the internal coming out you know I
30:30 - feel like it's much more like authentic
30:35 - way powerful so much more authentic way
30:38 - and then it's like you know that is
30:41 - actually crazy Kazi yeah I have to say
30:43 - something on that - okay I was gonna say
30:45 - like then you know like then you can
30:47 - trust yourself because if everything's
30:49 - coming from internal like you know
30:51 - exactly how you're gonna throw this you
30:53 - know exactly how this is gonna feel you
30:54 - know your strengths and your weaknesses
30:56 - because and then you can be more
30:58 - confident in yourself I feel like
31:00 - because you're you know 1,000% like
31:03 - what's in you yeah not like oh I'm
31:07 - try to I'm gonna try to move my head
31:09 - like Mike Tyson but you've never really
31:11 - seen what works for you maybe that head
31:13 - movement doesn't work yeah and all
31:15 - you're doing is trying to be like this
31:16 - person be like this person be like this
31:17 - person you lose your own style maybe my
31:20 - style is cooler than Mike Tyson's damn
31:22 - calling out Mike Tyson but um I don't
31:26 - know you know everybody has so many
31:28 - different variables
31:29 - yeah did we do something with the
31:31 - variables here we did right here that's
31:33 - a very that's a variable then you kept
31:35 - calling that variable yeah calling out
31:37 - all my variables that's right okay yeah
31:41 - what were you I was gonna say that the
31:44 - the most important thing that you just
31:47 - said about the internal coming out
31:49 - rather than the external coming in when
31:51 - it has to come with content creation and
31:54 - everything and even making projects in
31:57 - code what I realize is as soon as I as
32:02 - soon as I list after the number one way
32:05 - for me to not make a video that day is
32:07 - when I get a idea for video to go and
32:11 - research it and see how everybody else
32:14 - has done it when I look at like eight or
32:16 - twelve other people doing the similar
32:18 - thing in videos that day is like I'd
32:22 - never do anything of my own because I'm
32:25 - along so much external to come in and it
32:27 - just bears heavy same thing when I'm
32:29 - doing a coding project I'm like I want
32:30 - to work on this and just get started I'm
32:31 - about to get started and I'm like let me
32:33 - go in like look at some notes some
32:35 - lecture some lessons some inspiration
32:38 - about design around this online and I go
32:41 - to look it up and then I'm like [ __ ]
32:42 - this I don't want to do it at all
32:44 - anymore because they're just too much
32:46 - external coming in instead of the
32:47 - internal to me
32:49 - yeah because also I think it makes you
32:51 - like second-guess yourself it's like oh
32:54 - well they did it this way that was
32:57 - successful yeah that was successful for
33:00 - them yes I do it that way but then you
33:02 - start bringing that in and you're like
33:03 - oh man now I have to switch my way and
33:05 - do it like that but it doesn't feel fun
33:07 - to do it their way because you're not
33:09 - them
33:09 - yeah so when you're not inspired anymore
33:11 - to do it your way because really when
33:13 - you're making your own content it's just
33:15 - you coming across because nobody's made
33:16 - such it like this you know and it just
33:18 - you and I just came up with this we're
33:20 - like let's just do it
33:20 - yeah yeah that's so [ __ ] cool
33:28 - [Music]
33:31 - but I see that like I'm I'm guilty do
33:35 - you come guilty people just things our
33:39 - like psychically connected right we so
33:41 - many inside jokes you can never keep up
33:45 - cute baby
33:47 - grandpa what was I saying oh I'm so
33:53 - guilty of this yeah he's always
33:55 - shadowboxing I'm so guilty of like yeah
33:58 - going online like what I'm gonna maybe
34:01 - not just what I'm gonna post something
34:02 - games but like if I'm just like
34:06 - scrolling and I start to see people that
34:08 - are like Fitness people they're doing
34:09 - similar things like I want to make
34:11 - fitness videos and I'm like looking at
34:13 - their stuff I'm like oh I see their
34:17 - exercises I'm like well well maybe my
34:18 - exercises that I was gonna do aren't
34:20 - good enough and then I like yeah I'm
34:22 - like hmm I should wait until I have
34:24 - better ideas so I never put the videos
34:25 - out like I never make it happen so it's
34:28 - just completely like stifles your
34:31 - progress and you creates a video a
34:33 - beautiful sound likes people yeah but it
34:39 - does stifle when you look out for
34:41 - external yeah when I'm about to create
34:45 - content I literally put myself in a
34:46 - [ __ ] cave I don't know is I can't
34:49 - reach you on the phone yeah you can't
34:50 - reach me on the phone or something where
34:56 - I have a lot of trouble that's why I
34:59 - don't even message you back I'll read
35:01 - your message and I won't even message
35:03 - you back because on boyfriend leaves me
35:05 - on read 100% dude
35:07 - and the reason why I'll do it is because
35:10 - even messaging you back [ __ ] me up even
35:13 - messaging you back put [ __ ] in my head
35:16 - weird like now my thoughts are like are
35:18 - you getting a different headspace yeah
35:19 - then I'm like a message you back that
35:21 - I'm waiting on your message because I'm
35:22 - expecting that you're gonna message me
35:24 - back then so really your energy is
35:26 - right and that I can't have that like
35:29 - what I'm creating I just cannot allow
35:32 - any consumption to come in it's almost
35:34 - like the assumption I look at it like
35:36 - poison in my body yeah you know yeah and
35:39 - if I don't feel that like balance of
35:43 - creation and versus consumption my
35:46 - creation is more I like want to actually
35:48 - puke
35:48 - like literally I want to throw up
35:50 - physically and for developers is so
35:53 - important to because they forget to
35:55 - create stuff you know it's like a boxer
35:58 - who never fights a developer who never
35:59 - creates is the same as a [ __ ] tree
36:02 - falling in the forest does it make a
36:03 - sound or not you never know right and if
36:06 - there's nobody to hear it there's nobody
36:08 - here how's with you go yeah you see what
36:14 - I'm saying yeah that's good but yeah you
36:15 - have to like be able to apply the skills
36:18 - that you have and like put them out yes
36:20 - and like spend that time on creating you
36:23 - know spend that time on like actually
36:25 - sparring yeah spend that time on did you
36:28 - literally don't know what you're capable
36:29 - of until you like put your skills into
36:32 - action yeah thank you have to take
36:35 - action right baby that's right yeah um
36:38 - yeah because like when I well I mean
36:42 - even and you never stop learning what
36:45 - you're capable and different things try
36:48 - different angles that's like a boxing
36:50 - thing um but you know it's like because
36:54 - even when I was okay so like say when I
36:57 - started boxing and I was just using bags
36:58 - and mates I didn't know distance of like
37:02 - how to reach a human face you know or
37:05 - people move there's a lot of variables
37:07 - so it's like okay it's not the same at
37:09 - all so when I started sparring I'm like
37:11 - okay now I know what I'm really capable
37:13 - of off the myths but then when you're
37:16 - sparring that's one level because that
37:18 - person is not actually trying to like
37:20 - win something or like you know actually
37:23 - maybe knock you out you're trying to
37:25 - learn during sparring yeah so then you
37:27 - go to the next level I fought amateurs
37:28 - it's like okay now I see you like what
37:31 - I'm made of like when there's pressure
37:33 - added like there's a timeless
37:35 - like you know it's it adds a lot more to
37:39 - see like what you can do with the skills
37:42 - when this is the scenario yeah
37:44 - then on then when you turn the girl
37:45 - there's no head gear ouch that hurts a
37:49 - little bit more to get hit it's like now
37:51 - how do you stay focused now are you
37:52 - testing your mental skills even more
37:54 - yeah when you get hit you know bare face
37:58 - and everything like that how do you stay
37:59 - in the game can your skills still stand
38:02 - up when you're thinking about holy [ __ ]
38:04 - I just got hit in the face like if I get
38:06 - hit again like that I could be on the
38:07 - canvas this could be it this could be
38:09 - the end of my career like there's a lot
38:11 - on the line so it's like the higher
38:13 - levels you go you have to keep like
38:15 - testing what you're capable of but the
38:18 - only way to do that is to do it like
38:20 - literally just do it then afterwards the
38:23 - payoff is so good cuz you're like wow
38:25 - I'm really capable of that so I can only
38:28 - imagine like I'm pretty proud of myself
38:29 - for making like squares a window with
38:33 - the turtle yeah oh and you should be
38:35 - this is awesome thanks baby
38:37 - yeah but I can't imagine like how badass
38:40 - I would feel if I like created something
38:43 - like on a website where like literally
38:45 - like you click and like something
38:47 - happens like or like that hover thing
38:49 - that you showed me on Instagram like but
38:52 - like if you create a like a function
38:54 - like that I can't even like I would feel
38:56 - like damn like I could like take over
38:59 - the world especially because coding is a
39:02 - skill that like you can pretty much run
39:04 - the world with like right so what is it
39:07 - Netflix like all these yeah all these
39:09 - things and I mean all the websites but
39:13 - like you're saying like I specifically
39:14 - with your Python stuff right
39:16 - it's like Python created Netflix right
39:20 - yeah that's pretty dope I use Netflix a
39:23 - lot nice a little bit too much I use it
39:26 - because I really like this new show I
39:27 - started watching what is it call you
39:30 - won't like it
39:31 - it's called girlfriends guide to divorce
39:34 - girlfriends got no girlfriends guide to
39:38 - divorce voice yeah
39:40 - mrs. and mrs. Mayville thing not a
39:44 - different show
39:44 - the marvelous mrs. means when you were
39:46 - talking about that I was like oh I don't
39:48 - but then tangent told me it's actually

39:52 - damn yeah I should watch it
39:59 - just kidding boy alert India well okay
40:08 - so let's wrap this up
40:09 - always wrap it up Wow no I'm beatboxing
40:19 - you're supposed to wrap it up this is it
40:26 - we're done with our coding I don't like
40:30 - to sit down maybe you rap I'll be let's
40:35 - go do you have to do this let me be I
40:37 - see people do this okay we done with the
40:47 - coding we just main windows ah window
40:50 - sucks get a Mac or get a life
40:53 - either or that's just fine I drop 4500
40:57 - on a Mac she saw the guy whose name was
40:59 - Big Mac then we a and now we alright
41:11 - guys thank you so much this is it this
41:14 - is Kazi from cover a little this is Kazi
41:17 - from clever programmer and and this is
41:20 - sugar Shaw from clever programmer I'm a
41:24 - programmer now again I learn how to do a
41:26 - turtle code yeah alright guys so thank
41:29 - you for watching I hope you enjoyed it
41:31 - please leave a comment below if you
41:33 - liked it like the video subscribe to the

Cleaned transcript:

this can be commandv okay manager we're gonna come and enter oh yeah I didn't check it the last time all right there you go most important part of coding with your girlfriend's is taking kisi breaks that's right the most important part yeah now with that said Kitty rate let's jump to it what's up guys this is Kazi here from clever programmer calm i'm here today with my girlfriend and we're gonna be trying something new i'm here with what's up guys this is sugar siya great thanks so I'm here with sugar Shah so this is gonna be really interesting because gonna be a pro boxer trying to learn how to code alright so we're gonna we're gonna try to code with her let's see how far she gets and then we don't try we do we just do so we tried one time to code before on an airplane yeah but that was about it on a second so today we'll do it for like two seconds okay okay yeah yeah and we're gonna be capturing your live reaction to coding okay this is actually very kind of cool because then you can actually see it you know a week from now a month or a year from now credit code yeah and now my name is Amber Lee turtle that's right oh yeah we'll drop that as a link underneath the video so you guys can actually see that okay okay so let's get started okay now the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna start drawing with a turtle you remember the turtle yeah okay so we're gonna learn visually this way you get to learn I get to learn and hopefully somebody who's watching this to learn yeah alright hopefully the turtle has a great time yeah and we're not gonna do it oh yeah and we're not gonna do it in a boring way yeah okay so let's start the first thing we're gonna do is like import the turtle okay what is that that's like basically we didn't have access to him now we have access to play with them yeah that's it alright I like animals baby yeah you do yeah okay I I like most animals every animal except my dog yeah that's true okay just kidding I like him okay okay alright let's continue OOP dodged that one alright so let's create a let's create your turtle okay so let's go ahead and call it my underscore turtle so go ahead yeah type it okay my remember kids variables you don't have to put a space if you can't have spaces in there there you go uh and then you what you want to do is like my turtle yeah and then you want to set this variable to something so we're creating a variable okay this is gonna be like this is where the turtle is gonna be stored so we do this and then we put an equal sign equal a space space and now here we put like turtle turtle so this is like one of those weird ominous lines but this actually goes ahead and creates your turtle I think hopefully hopefully you think yeah but you are the king so let's hit run and see if we get any errors we didn't get any error so it looks like we did a good job great job baby okay now we start doing things with the turtle so remember we could move the turtle forward to the left or backward right so let's try to move the turtle forward okay okay that's fine we'll figure it out right now so type in my underscore turtle so that's like your turtle and then can I just click E yep you can click and then I'll just go and now dot dot and now you can say forward forward yep and put in parenthesis yep and just type in like 100 the word or the number yep and do command enter so I can hit room so basically just hit run that command enter his run on replica this thing that we're using so okay so you just went forward right yeah now what we want to do is you want to make a square so if we want to make it square like let's sectionally just learn how to turn him for a second okay yeah so the two turns to type my turtle again and then dot yeah just hit enter oh really yep dot dot and let's go make him turn right 90 degrees so do right right and then parenthesis uhhuh oops that's not a friend Francie's 90 that's it and then I'm gonna hit command and direct like yep that's it [ __ ] yes oh he turn I saw him now like you breakdance on his head yes that's right it looks like he's doing like yeah yeah I forget what they're all windy papa where they're having a competition are you serious no I think it's just I couldn't think of it actually are you serious windmill dance move let's look it up you know oh wow that's it you're actually right now was it yeah that's actually what the turtle [ __ ] did yeah I did a windmill okay now let's make it okay now so you have this and now I'm gonna challenge you okay baby I like a good challenge just using these two commands this is all you know you don't know anything else right now using those two can you go ahead and make a square can you make him make a square this is tricky you shouldn't get this because we haven't made a square yet I'm just gonna you do it you do it go ahead okay and you can take a few tries you have to get it right now I'm gonna do I'm gonna do that my underscore turtle uhhuh dot I'm gonna go forward again you can see already turning frenzy okay Iran perfect okay great he went forward yeah we have very important this and that yeah that's it and it's very important like all of us test your code incrementally so what she just did is actually something very intelligent she doesn't even know what she did she was practicing it but every line of code she's actually writing she's hitting run intuitive that's really really that's really good this call for a kisi break okay excuse me my way about busy coding here now okay we're gonna make him do a windmill again all right oh no he's messing up okay keep going don't pay attention to me well you're fluffing my hair come to me hard not to pay attention when you're flipping my hair okay now we're gonna do my okay uhhuh we just click on it cuz Jess it okay and now we're gonna go right again okay we're making all right turns and right angles actually to make this turn that's right okay so we're gonna go over that's right okay we're gonna we're gonna run it come on enter uhhuh and we're gonna see he did a windmill beautiful so now we're gonna mentally check that code that's my baby running so now you don't have to keep on typing it over you can copy and paste it okay just like highlight this if you uh huh and then just two lines Nancy the copy I'm gonna command C to copy and then like go somewhere and then command V to paste beautiful I was wondering why did they put V for paste I never understand that's actually stupid well the only thing that I can ever understand is like it's close to C so there's like a man C command B but it should be command P like it really should be command P buy a copy and paste but copying them yeah okay now that's gonna make three sides so we need to do that again okay so it's already copied so we're just going to return and make sure you paste it and hit enter oh yeah I didn't check it the last time all right there you go oh I heard update is weird wow this calls for a kiss here eh that's really really great I did it good job okay that's yeah and Bachman break yeah thanks he teaches me coding and I teach you in boxing know what we should do in between our coding sessions like why we do a kisi break or something like that we can also do like a like holding the myths and like boxing break and then cut back to the training we could be switching back and forth between the two because pivot II inspires brain sexual like that's an appropriate for encoding video yes all right not when it comes to popup that's right it's way too obvious so what I you to you you have to do it like real cool just like no but not not just too much like all I do is I like to be very subtle so I'll display I know and that's so sexy and that's my Nine's okay I always just say the words winkwink nudgenudge alright now that we have made a square these lines of code made the square right yes okay from line 6 to 16 yeah we can actually do is we can give this thing an 8 and then we can just refer back to that name so for example we can call this thing we can call it like turtle Square maker yeah and then whenever we say whatever it doesn't matter but if we create turtle square maker and hit enter it'll make a square every time okay so what do you want to call instead of that I want to call it um we're now entering the world of functions kids I want to call it silly square all right so here's what you're gonna do you're gonna set define d EF not full so just do D yet and the hit space most def so yeah space and then do whatever you set silly square but it has to be one word okay and yeah we like alliteration open closed paren what there that's it okay all the way and at the end of that make sure you put a colon go outside of that how do I do that yep all right now it is that a colon yeah this is a colon that's correct goal from line 6 to 16 drag it off from line 6 to 16 I'm gonna drag from line 6 to 16 and then just hit tab to indent it beautiful now hit command enter come on okay now nothing should happen nothing happened all we've done is they've just given this a name close to the square yeah in other words we've actually created in technical terms and nerdy terms we've created a function okay now whenever we call that function a function is that a song yeah we just got you're trying to function yeah baby come on efore tea and stuff I don't really know those attached the guys you know Drake and stuff all those okay so silly square is a function silly square is a function all right and you can call that function by just saying its name that's it so if you say its name Oh silly square if you say it's the thing with open closed paren ya know call it this sees why do you just say for in it's too much work so yes do you all nerds say prayer no the cool people said friend I think it sounds like parental parental choice okay so let's call the function let's do it let's call the function now how I just said I spoken not you got to type it in silly oh there he goes and to open close all right what do ideas vary there it is and now hit command enter oh my god there he goes the silly square yep and what would happen if you want to make so let's say that we do my turtle dot forward again uhhuh by 100 and let's say that after it travels 100 oh actually that was what I think you want to go let's do that let's not turn him again right yeah you see what I'm what I kind of did or not you you went for it again I was gonna say up but it's just for it again yeah so you see how when I was so voice instead of turning him because he was turning right here yes so then so all I did was remove this line now he doesn't turn right there anymore he doesn't straight we took one windmill in turn so instead he stopped facing north and then we went short 100 so he continued north that's right now we're making a skyscraper okay so we've made one square now can we make another square how would we make another square if we wanted to like if we want to make a square right here yeah we'll just repeat okay so do it okay but I can't just put silly square why not well you already have one guy up there then he's gonna go like all the way back today but okay but would that make a square yeah okay let's do it here we go operation silly squares and dirt openclose openclose oops and hit command okay let's see what's gonna happen guys he goes up oh my god he went way too far because he starts off by for room 100 okay so you made another square yeah but that's there's a space in the square what space well yeah so so okay so what we can do is I can remove this line and then that space won't be there anymore I can just do it like that right and then you can call it again and then yeah okay so every time you say silly square it goes through these lines of code then when you say silly square it goes through this line of code again all of these lines so now he's facing this riccati daily square he's gonna go this would give it a try see what okay let's give it a try guys silly square paren mmhmm okay here we go he makes one silly square and goes up it makes my square and goes over I mean another silly square and what would happen if we did it one more time then here we go forward down and make another silly squared okay and then guys it's gonna be like we're making takes a cube like a window basically oh it's a window yeah so give it a try okay one more silly square and then we do the paren 1 squared done whoop another square done over 1 9 s squared 9 down another square done okay guys we made a full window job great job ok so that's pretty dope you have so you pretty much got this figured out how does this feel so far for you to code this up and does this seem like something that's really really hard no it seems manageable it doesn't like stress me out and you know I get like technological anxiety yeah so it doesn't stress you out that much that's really good that's fun actually because you get this like you make something happen yeah that's kind of cool yeah yeah it's like pretty because if I like suck at art I mean I don't I don't know but like I feel I like drawing and stuff but I don't feel like something actually happens when I do it yeah but when you code even if you're coding for your first time you can actually make something happen yeah well I I think I like it cuz it's like like in boxing you don't get immediate results and nobody's you don't get immediate results so it's like satisfying because you get like you just type something really quick and like 1 second later it's something's happening even like you made it do that right kind of empowering like it's true I [ __ ] did it that's true that's true and like just happens right away yeah and then you can see it if there's a mistake you fix it right away yeah yeah so you don't have to like like in boxing you have to go like review video and see what I did wrong in sparring stuff and then it takes a weeks to fix errors that are ingrained in me because I'm not a computer run so you can fix these things so fast I think that's cool yeah like even when I was when I went to Train ping pong like table tennis with my coach he actually said that it would actually be better if I hadn't been playing yeah because I had formed such poor habit I have it but there's no way to detect them sometimes there's no way to know and and the results are right of your skill developing takes so long yeah and you don't really see and experience anything kind of happening immediately another thing I don't know if you know but you could actually you could actually extend this link this over here to literally your mom and when she'd go sit she clicks the button run it like do that no way right so if you actually put color in there where it like fills up each square with like green color orange color red color or something you could send it to somebody or whoever it right and then hit it and then it'll like fill up those colors dad you know so it's like I feel that you could do a lot of these things really really quickly now that's good that you feel a little bit more confident how do you feel if how what did you feel like coding was and after doing this what does it feel like to you now hmm coding felt like alien language right like it's not real like how can you just make something later where do you even go to make something good like what how do you know like what to type in like how can you just put words and then the computer knows it action like I don't know right I can't I couldn't like grasp the concept yeah and it just seemed like especially for me somebody who doesn't even like I mean you know technology kind of like is overwhelming to me like even setting up like internet or capable or like something like you know like going through process of doing something it's like really stressful for me and but this was now now I like understand it more it's a lot of repetition which I like you guys like boxing training all that stuff is repetition yeah I love that and so I feel like you can learn as you go yeah yes now I see it's not alien language right yeah I you know because I see it in action yes yeah so now it's not so scary yep and now it was like a real thing yeah so still crazy to me it's like no mind boy still really crazy right yeah I'd like to think like this is just okay like all these lines just to make like this little window yeah like people make full like graphics and websites and like apps and like yeah it's like endless opportunities of stuff and like you can never stop learning right yeah crazy you can't you can keep going forever even you know another thing we can even do one time is like create a website together yeah we can create like a simple looking website yeah together but yeah such Illium alienlooking language in the start then you start getting used to it but you're right it's like a pet it's like patterning action once you start seeing it many more times but like all it's a function all I'm just calling a function it's like the same thing like that makes a square but we're here learning visually in teachers in school you know how they actually teach this yeah they teach it with [ __ ] math and numbers and formulas so for example if you are wrong here right and if you make a mistake yeah I don't even have to tell you your Square will loom yeah with a square right it will look like not something else he'll go in a wrong direction he'll go in the wrong direction right and so in that case we'll end up happening is you will instantly know whether that's right or wrong in school when it's some math formula or you're supposed to get some number you're not even gonna know you're wrong like instead of getting seven point eight six six six seven two three as your answer you'll get like five point two five six six as your answer and you'll be like huh why am I wrong I don't understand you see and literally like don't even understand how while you're talking about like using math to do this like I don't write this and itself is crazy then I mean how do you do what I don't know doing like all kinds of physics problems you know it's like if your mom weighs hundred and ten pounds and she falls off the [ __ ] plane how long will it take her to hit the floor yeah they don't actually give you a special price yeah but like similar you're not the idea similar it's like Oh a rock falls from the roof and the gravitational pull is like whatever and I don't know how to figure that out like I would have to look it up and I have to look up or how much gravity is and I would why do you need that for coding well because then what you can do is you can just put in like somebody's body weight and it'll instantly tell you how long it takes them to hit the floor or how long it is it's like so morbid but how long it takes that thing to hit the floor so you'd create this program though automatically like all this calculator you know for example if you want to check your like body mass index yeah or you want to check like what how much percentage body fat do I have well we can actually code up something religions like how would you figure it out normally what's the recipe to figure it out do you would tell me what's your body weight Yeah right never that's not none of that's accurate to test your body I know but like the normal formula it would to be something like you would give me your body weight then maybe you'd give me how much fat you have and then I give you back I'll like calculate it I'll go through these series of steps and I'll be like this is the body fat percentage yeah right well I could just have it caught it up so then as soon as you put in your body fat into it and then you put your weight it instantly just tell you yeah so you have to go through the process over and over again every single time that sounds terrible right but that's the boring way of how a lot easy chip the teaching numbers wouldn't it be cooler if they taught it where you went to like Instagram right and they were like well Instagram is actually made with code yeah when you hover over and the screen turns like that you got my followers good job baby thank you when you hover over like that that's actually somebody coded that in to be like oh when somebody hovers over show the number of likes and show the number of comments how cool right if I click into this somebody's coded it up so then it shows like my three hundred and seventy others right but if it's somebody who's really closely following Kazi then when they like it show their name next you see what I'm saying yeah so that's called a frontend user interface so it's like somebody's coding that up and if they're giving examples like that I soak so much cooler and if we're working on projects where we're building a clone of this you'll be like even I don't even if I don't understand every single line of code I get what we're doing and then you'll keep trying to work towards doing it versus this is a right formula that's not an answer you should get well especially for me because I'm an athlete and stuff like handson is way better like visual handson like learning through errors like this way and you're seeing it like way easier for me like doing a formula I'll quit before you write yeah that's a terrible way to teach I think well maybe not for some people I can't say that but like I don't learn that way I'm guessing most people that are like millennia and what's this new generation Gen X yeah yeah I don't know whatever they are these little [ __ ] um everybody is used to like everything visual and you know screens and all this stuff so like I don't think they're gonna learn that way you do yeah yeah I long as it's more physical and like everybody is a different learning style yeah you know for example for me my learning style is very different than yours yeah I can just sit down and focus for like 20 hours and I have to take it serious after your rings but then that's but then you can also do 20 [ __ ] rounds of boxing and one you know or ten rounds of boxing in one session 18 to 20 right Christ so you can do that and keep going and stay focused on that over the course of months and years so everybody just a different learning style is very kinetic and it has to be respected your learning style has to be respected this [ __ ] system of the academic world where you have to learn the exact same way that like the other person has to learn the exact same way I have to learn like I remember I'd be sitting in a chemistry class and this old ass teacher she was trying to teach us something and she was terrible at her job like nobody ever learned anything from her I'm serious like you know and so I am like okay I can't learn from her so I opened up my laptop to learn on my own and take my own notes and she's like just what are you doing with the laptop she's like put the laptop away and I'm like like just watching porn man yeah I'm like I'm actually learning like I'm looking up the things yeah like supplementing if she's like it's not watching movies I like I'm not watching [ __ ] she stopped then I put it away and then it was like I couldn't learn from her she wouldn't let me learn yeah she just wanted us to all learn the same way and it's just [ __ ] yeah yeah and hey we will try to put you in a box and then and then it's frustrating you just don't want to do it anyway you're a boxer and you barely even watch you didn't even watch the Pacquiao fight don't forget last no but what I'm saying is that's great yeah like everybody is a different way to learn and think like you're not even learning from watching the fights you're just learning on your own in their own way of doing it with your coach and power and you became pro yeah I do watch some fights like to review stuff and like look at different styles but um mostly because I'm like so visual I don't really want somebody else's style stuck in my head in case it doesn't work for me mmhmm which is why I mean that's not why I don't it's some busy which is I miss fight a lot yeah um but I yeah I learned more by tweaking my own style and like going through the motions and repetition yeah like handson repetition which is exactly this right well not this encoding the others um and then yeah like reviewing my own tape so that I'm like digesting and like visually seeing and fixing my own style in my own mistakes and like you do have to like study other fighters so you mean you can get inspiration from other places I do the same thing for acting I study other actors but at the end of the day like I don't want that to be my main source of inspiration or like I just don't want to like write you want to bring it from internal like yeah I don't want the external coming and I want the internal coming out you know I feel like it's much more like authentic way powerful so much more authentic way and then it's like you know that is actually crazy Kazi yeah I have to say something on that okay I was gonna say like then you know like then you can trust yourself because if everything's coming from internal like you know exactly how you're gonna throw this you know exactly how this is gonna feel you know your strengths and your weaknesses because and then you can be more confident in yourself I feel like because you're you know 1,000% like what's in you yeah not like oh I'm try to I'm gonna try to move my head like Mike Tyson but you've never really seen what works for you maybe that head movement doesn't work yeah and all you're doing is trying to be like this person be like this person be like this person you lose your own style maybe my style is cooler than Mike Tyson's damn calling out Mike Tyson but um I don't know you know everybody has so many different variables yeah did we do something with the variables here we did right here that's a very that's a variable then you kept calling that variable yeah calling out all my variables that's right okay yeah what were you I was gonna say that the the most important thing that you just said about the internal coming out rather than the external coming in when it has to come with content creation and everything and even making projects in code what I realize is as soon as I as soon as I list after the number one way for me to not make a video that day is when I get a idea for video to go and research it and see how everybody else has done it when I look at like eight or twelve other people doing the similar thing in videos that day is like I'd never do anything of my own because I'm along so much external to come in and it just bears heavy same thing when I'm doing a coding project I'm like I want to work on this and just get started I'm about to get started and I'm like let me go in like look at some notes some lecture some lessons some inspiration about design around this online and I go to look it up and then I'm like [ __ ] this I don't want to do it at all anymore because they're just too much external coming in instead of the internal to me yeah because also I think it makes you like secondguess yourself it's like oh well they did it this way that was successful yeah that was successful for them yes I do it that way but then you start bringing that in and you're like oh man now I have to switch my way and do it like that but it doesn't feel fun to do it their way because you're not them yeah so when you're not inspired anymore to do it your way because really when you're making your own content it's just you coming across because nobody's made such it like this you know and it just you and I just came up with this we're like let's just do it yeah yeah that's so [ __ ] cool but I see that like I'm I'm guilty do you come guilty people just things our like psychically connected right we so many inside jokes you can never keep up cute baby grandpa what was I saying oh I'm so guilty of this yeah he's always shadowboxing I'm so guilty of like yeah going online like what I'm gonna maybe not just what I'm gonna post something games but like if I'm just like scrolling and I start to see people that are like Fitness people they're doing similar things like I want to make fitness videos and I'm like looking at their stuff I'm like oh I see their exercises I'm like well well maybe my exercises that I was gonna do aren't good enough and then I like yeah I'm like hmm I should wait until I have better ideas so I never put the videos out like I never make it happen so it's just completely like stifles your progress and you creates a video a beautiful sound likes people yeah but it does stifle when you look out for external yeah when I'm about to create content I literally put myself in a [ __ ] cave I don't know is I can't reach you on the phone yeah you can't reach me on the phone or something where I have a lot of trouble that's why I don't even message you back I'll read your message and I won't even message you back because on boyfriend leaves me on read 100% dude and the reason why I'll do it is because even messaging you back [ __ ] me up even messaging you back put [ __ ] in my head weird like now my thoughts are like are you getting a different headspace yeah then I'm like a message you back that I'm waiting on your message because I'm expecting that you're gonna message me back then so really your energy is right and that I can't have that like what I'm creating I just cannot allow any consumption to come in it's almost like the assumption I look at it like poison in my body yeah you know yeah and if I don't feel that like balance of creation and versus consumption my creation is more I like want to actually puke like literally I want to throw up physically and for developers is so important to because they forget to create stuff you know it's like a boxer who never fights a developer who never creates is the same as a [ __ ] tree falling in the forest does it make a sound or not you never know right and if there's nobody to hear it there's nobody here how's with you go yeah you see what I'm saying yeah that's good but yeah you have to like be able to apply the skills that you have and like put them out yes and like spend that time on creating you know spend that time on like actually sparring yeah spend that time on did you literally don't know what you're capable of until you like put your skills into action yeah thank you have to take action right baby that's right yeah um yeah because like when I well I mean even and you never stop learning what you're capable and different things try different angles that's like a boxing thing um but you know it's like because even when I was okay so like say when I started boxing and I was just using bags and mates I didn't know distance of like how to reach a human face you know or people move there's a lot of variables so it's like okay it's not the same at all so when I started sparring I'm like okay now I know what I'm really capable of off the myths but then when you're sparring that's one level because that person is not actually trying to like win something or like you know actually maybe knock you out you're trying to learn during sparring yeah so then you go to the next level I fought amateurs it's like okay now I see you like what I'm made of like when there's pressure added like there's a timeless like you know it's it adds a lot more to see like what you can do with the skills when this is the scenario yeah then on then when you turn the girl there's no head gear ouch that hurts a little bit more to get hit it's like now how do you stay focused now are you testing your mental skills even more yeah when you get hit you know bare face and everything like that how do you stay in the game can your skills still stand up when you're thinking about holy [ __ ] I just got hit in the face like if I get hit again like that I could be on the canvas this could be it this could be the end of my career like there's a lot on the line so it's like the higher levels you go you have to keep like testing what you're capable of but the only way to do that is to do it like literally just do it then afterwards the payoff is so good cuz you're like wow I'm really capable of that so I can only imagine like I'm pretty proud of myself for making like squares a window with the turtle yeah oh and you should be this is awesome thanks baby yeah but I can't imagine like how badass I would feel if I like created something like on a website where like literally like you click and like something happens like or like that hover thing that you showed me on Instagram like but like if you create a like a function like that I can't even like I would feel like damn like I could like take over the world especially because coding is a skill that like you can pretty much run the world with like right so what is it Netflix like all these yeah all these things and I mean all the websites but like you're saying like I specifically with your Python stuff right it's like Python created Netflix right yeah that's
