00:19 - show exactly what they're doing to make
00:21 - you either
00:22 - buy purchase their product or just stay
00:25 - in their websites because
00:27 - they all have different functionalities
00:29 - to it and it's going to be very very
00:30 - interesting
00:31 - so right off the bat we're going to jump
00:33 - into you know if you guys
00:35 - really do enjoy this content if you guys
00:37 - like the design
00:38 - type of content that we're going to be

00:44 - make sure to
00:45 - smash that like button because it's
00:46 - going to help out really
00:48 - a lot a lot a lot with the youtube
00:49 - algorithm and it's going to help it
00:51 - spread to a lot of different people so
00:53 - if you're a web developer
00:54 - if you're a web designer if you work in
00:57 - front end or anything related to that i
00:59 - think you're gonna get
01:00 - massive massive value off of this video
01:03 - so really do like that that freaking
01:06 - thumbs up button
01:07 - and also check out one of our courses
01:10 - and our free
01:11 - one hour training that we show you how
01:13 - to become a javascript developer and we
01:14 - show you
01:15 - these super kick-ass
01:18 - designs that you can implement in your
01:20 - apps and that will get you
01:22 - first of all paid second about hired
01:24 - third of all just
01:25 - getting to make projects that are really
01:28 - useful for people people
01:29 - really want are going to want to use
01:30 - them so let's jump right into it so
01:33 - off the bat i added a gif right here
01:35 - which is i think super awesome because
01:37 - it shows a little bit of animation right
01:39 - now animation
01:40 - is super super hip super super in
01:42 - instead of design
01:43 - and the thing about this is that you see
01:45 - it as just like maybe
01:47 - things moving around in the screen which
01:48 - is dope it really is but at the same
01:50 - time you see 3d
01:52 - design inside of it and at the same time
01:54 - you see very humanistic like type of
01:56 - movement inside
01:57 - so it's subtle yet it actually
02:00 - applies with a lot of different design
02:02 - trends that are going on right now in
02:03 - this year
02:04 - so right now we're going to be
02:06 - dissecting the 7up
02:08 - website right so 7up website actually
02:10 - was
02:11 - i was recommended to it by one of our
02:13 - viewers
02:14 - which i think was pretty freaking dope
02:16 - and awesome and right now we have about
02:18 - 250 concurrent viewers
02:20 - that's awesome if you guys like this
02:22 - type of content make sure to
02:23 - share it with your friends let everybody
02:25 - learn let everybody
02:26 - you know hop in this train of design and
02:29 - ui ux
02:30 - so let's get it out there for us many
02:32 - people so what i want to do is check out
02:34 - the 7up website which i think is one of
02:36 - the best websites that i've seen
02:38 - in modern times at least in 2020 so
02:41 - let's actually click on it let's go cool
02:44 - so this is the 7up website right off the
02:46 - bat what we can do
02:47 - and see from this and dissect from this
02:50 - actually
02:50 - is the fact that it's super human like
02:53 - so
02:53 - one of the big top trends designs of
02:56 - these websites and really
02:58 - let me sew a video plate so it makes it
03:01 - very accessible
03:02 - for you to go into the videos and all of
03:04 - these things
03:05 - let me actually mute this right here
03:07 - here you go so
03:09 - the cool thing about it is that it makes
03:10 - it super human-like right so it shows a
03:12 - glass
03:13 - of 7-up it shows how images move around
03:16 - all of this it shows a glass you know
03:19 - from
03:20 - the top to the bottom it's kind of like
03:22 - if you were looking at it in a
03:23 - perspective of a human right
03:25 - so it's super super dope in that sense
03:27 - big images like i said are super in
03:29 - right now in 2020
03:30 - design wise specifically and also
03:33 - if as you can see here there's a human
03:35 - hand literally pouring a seven up over a
03:37 - drink
03:38 - man you never really drink seven up in
03:40 - this type of presentation you drink
03:41 - seven up in a freaking
03:42 - normal type of glass you know these guys
03:44 - are dropping it in a cocktail
03:46 - so they're already hitting up you know
03:48 - people that want to get refreshed by the
03:50 - drink people that want to make cocktails
03:51 - from the drink
03:52 - they're showing how to make cooking
03:54 - recipes for the drink
03:55 - and also literally seeing how to maybe
03:58 - make popsicles off of it
04:00 - and that is dope just because of the
04:01 - fact that you can use it so many
04:03 - different ways
04:04 - so already in this design you can see
04:06 - that it's super humanistic
04:08 - it shows images that you would see in
04:10 - real life
04:11 - you know scenarios scenarios that you
04:13 - would see in real life
04:14 - so all of these are different let me let
04:16 - me show you right now
04:18 - examples it's different examples that
04:19 - you can see pretty much so
04:22 - diving deeper into it you know 7up i
04:25 - think it's a great website to follow if
04:27 - you do want to follow
04:28 - what is very in what is very hip in
04:30 - designs right now
04:32 - only you know even the user experience
04:34 - of it is just
04:35 - amazing man this is so minimalistic this
04:38 - is so hip
04:39 - obviously these guys these guys are
04:41 - trying to hit
04:42 - you know younger markets you know if
04:44 - you're 65 years old
04:46 - you might not think this is actually
04:47 - that cool you know
04:49 - it's it's kind of even retro in a way
04:52 - which it's hitting that classical type
04:54 - of
04:54 - you know brand look that these guys have
04:56 - been going on have had going on in like
04:58 - the last maybe
04:59 - 10 20 years but also making it very hip
05:02 - and also very you know i think i think
05:06 - very
05:06 - interactive at the same time so you know
05:09 - diving a little bit deeper into this
05:11 - that was the seven up website
05:12 - i love it the big images like i said are
05:15 - very very in
05:16 - right now in 2020 it's one of the
05:18 - biggest things that you can do and this
05:20 - is one example
05:20 - that i'm going to share with you guys
05:22 - showing you how
05:24 - actually important it is to add photos
05:26 - in your app
05:28 - and website designs so specifically
05:31 - right here
05:31 - you can let me actually get my pointer
05:33 - here so you can see the eye tracking
05:35 - test so these are heat maps
05:37 - so wherever there is a little bit more
05:39 - red in the in the actual picture you can
05:41 - see where people
05:42 - are clicking the most where people are
05:44 - interacting with the most within that
05:46 - app within that website
05:47 - there's an image here and people are
05:50 - going you know around the text you can
05:51 - see the green
05:52 - that's that means people are clicking on
05:53 - around that type of area
05:55 - but specifically they're clicking on
05:56 - their face so even having an
05:59 - image that pretty much a girl that's
06:01 - pointing down like that just a girl
06:03 - that's pointing
06:04 - down like that you know gives a little
06:06 - bit of direction
06:07 - on how to move inside of that app and
06:10 - that's a big big thing that you're gonna
06:12 - have to implement in your design
06:14 - moving forward in 2020 and beyond it's
06:17 - you know all about
06:18 - the intuitiveness of how you move around
06:20 - a specific app or a website
06:22 - that's why big companies like tesla big
06:24 - companies like even rolex
06:26 - are killing it in their marketing in
06:28 - their web design
06:29 - because of that fact because they make
06:31 - it very easy
06:32 - for the user to use their specific
06:34 - websites man
06:36 - and so this is literally a real live
06:38 - example of that so
06:39 - moving forward there's another example
06:41 - that i want to show you guys
06:42 - there's so many different designs so
06:44 - many different designs depending on the
06:46 - branding that you have
06:47 - the branding is kind of gonna dictate
06:49 - the design of your website so
06:50 - you know depending on what product you
06:52 - sell what type of website you have
06:54 - whether that's maybe an online course
06:55 - website an e-commerce website
06:57 - maybe just an informational website that
06:59 - is gonna dictate what type of design
07:01 - you're gonna have in your website
07:02 - one that i like very much is gonna be
07:04 - the mecca website and the mecca website
07:06 - is cool because
07:08 - going back to this inside is it's an
07:10 - actual
07:11 - festival it's a huge festival in
07:14 - australia and look at it look
07:15 - so it's loading it shows a little 3d
07:18 - cube
07:18 - inside of it that's super hip man and
07:21 - guess what these guys are trying to
07:22 - target really young audiences
07:24 - and what we can see here is that what
07:27 - the man these guys are
07:29 - actually you know look at this like i'm
07:31 - hovering over
07:32 - you see pixel pixelated or or actual you
07:36 - know maybe static
07:37 - type pictures on top of the hovering
07:39 - effects
07:40 - man that is so dope so to me they kind
07:43 - of
07:44 - this kind of reminds me of the 90s style
07:46 - it's kind of like
07:47 - video gamey it's kind of like retro in a
07:49 - way
07:51 - i think it's so cool like if you guys if
07:53 - you want to target the 90s
07:55 - you know the 90s kids everybody that was
07:57 - earned that
07:58 - was born between 1990 maybe 1999 or
08:02 - whatever maybe even 1985
08:04 - these kids are gonna recognize this type
08:06 - of design because that's how it used to
08:08 - look websites used to look like this but
08:09 - at the same time
08:10 - it's like if you're looking at this you
08:12 - know that these guys are kind of
08:13 - advanced but they want to give that look
08:15 - so green with purple kind of is a very
08:18 - fresh type of look
08:19 - it doesn't go hand in hand with a lot of
08:21 - designs just because it's kind of like
08:23 - opposite like
08:24 - but at the same time you can see a lot
08:26 - of movement within this website
08:28 - so you got a big block a big picture
08:29 - here like i was mentioning
08:31 - big pictures big videos are very very in
08:33 - right now
08:34 - in design so all of this is part of that
08:37 - so
08:38 - you know you go over this it shows you
08:41 - how to maybe even download info
08:44 - everything that they offer in that page
08:46 - so
08:46 - you know going back to the actual
08:49 - presentation here i feel like
08:50 - it does depend a lot what your website
08:52 - is gonna be based
08:53 - on so you're gonna wanna pay attention
08:56 - to what type of branding you wanna make
08:58 - and all of those things are gonna be
09:00 - super important in dictating
09:02 - the type of website and the type of look
09:04 - that you're gonna get so
09:06 - going back into this i feel like a big
09:08 - big example of
09:09 - right now in the industry that you can
09:10 - see is going to be the tesla website
09:13 - and we might even build it with react
09:15 - just because it's
09:16 - so good tesla man their sales have
09:19 - increased like freaking crazy
09:21 - and the only way pretty much to buy a
09:22 - tesla is through this website
09:24 - so you guys have to know that it's
09:26 - getting results because at the end of
09:27 - the day
09:28 - let me put my keys here actually guys at
09:31 - the end of the day man
09:32 - design is awesome but if your design is
09:34 - not bringing any results
09:36 - then it doesn't even matter you know
09:37 - it's not about how things look it's how
09:40 - it's how things perform so the tesla
09:42 - website has shown to perform
09:44 - very very well we're going to go into it
09:46 - right now
09:47 - man apparently this was the let me see
09:51 - so uh cool there was the
09:55 - the freaking seven up link
09:58 - popping up but we're gonna pop out the
09:59 - tesla website really quick for you guys
10:02 - so we got it right here very very
10:05 - very popular look at this so it's very
10:07 - interactive
10:08 - as you guys can see like i'm talking
10:10 - about big images are super in right now
10:12 - a lot of times these images even move so
10:15 - animations
10:16 - subtle animations specifically is what's
10:18 - going to pop a lot in your website
10:20 - so scrolling down a little bit you can
10:22 - see how it even just
10:24 - scrolls up or down to what specific
10:26 - model you're looking at
10:28 - so the model x right you're seeing it
10:30 - not only are you seeing the car but
10:32 - you're seeing it
10:33 - you know interact in its own environment
10:35 - so this is where model x
10:37 - car would probably be the most
10:39 - successful you know in the road
10:41 - next to the mountains and stuff maybe
10:43 - the model 3
10:44 - would be cooler in the cities you're
10:46 - trying to you know
10:47 - this is more of a trip type of car so
10:49 - you're doing long form trips in it
10:51 - so they show it inside of the you know
10:53 - maybe the mountains maybe long roads
10:55 - like that
10:55 - model 3 is more like a city-like car so
10:58 - they're showing a picture of it in the
10:59 - city
11:00 - and even model s like i said it's it's
11:02 - more of a
11:03 - kind of like a high-speed type of car
11:05 - they're showing it where there's not
11:07 - many cars around
11:08 - and all of that is shown right here and
11:11 - let us see even man these guys are even
11:15 - showing you how the tesla would look
11:17 - inside of your house
11:18 - so all of these things are super genius
11:21 - man and it has a lot to do
11:23 - with the type of product that you're
11:24 - selling like i just said
11:26 - so you're going to want to sell a car
11:28 - you're going to want to sell and show
11:30 - mock-ups of how it would look in your
11:31 - house these are all the accessories that
11:33 - come with that
11:34 - but going back to you know the actual
11:36 - presentation itself
11:39 - tesla is a great great example of this
11:41 - because
11:42 - it's grown so much over the last years
11:44 - and people are loving it
11:46 - and like i said we're going to be
11:47 - creating it in the next few weeks for
11:49 - you guys using react
11:51 - using other type of technologies like
11:52 - that that are more web development
11:54 - based but right now we're going over
11:56 - design so let's dive
11:57 - a little bit deeper into all of this i
11:59 - feel like a good website for this too
12:01 - is gonna be rolex so rolex as you guys
12:04 - know
12:05 - has been uh it's it's it's withstand the
12:08 - test of thai man
12:09 - rolex is a brand that is amazing it's
12:12 - iconic it's cultural
12:14 - in so many cultures whether that's the
12:15 - european culture the american culture
12:18 - it's a symbol
12:18 - of success a symbol of you know having
12:21 - money having the money to spend on
12:23 - specific things
12:24 - and i'm telling you guys big
12:27 - big pictures and big videos are popping
12:30 - up a lot right now in design
12:32 - so these guys are essentially an
12:34 - e-commerce website
12:35 - and what are they doing they're showing
12:37 - their clocks or their watches
12:39 - in big big images because why
12:42 - i mean these are high high-end type of
12:45 - watches so
12:46 - let's click on it actually so you want
12:48 - to see these watches kind of having
12:51 - you know your design has to follow the
12:53 - feel of the watches so these
12:55 - watches specifically are you know grand
12:58 - they're
12:58 - they're big they're they're expansive so
13:02 - the design has to kind of follow that
13:04 - and off the bat
13:05 - as you go into the website you can see
13:07 - here there's a big
13:08 - big video to just welcome you inside of
13:11 - the website
13:12 - so it says out of the blue one of
13:14 - september so
13:15 - apparently they're making a launch with
13:17 - one of their new watches right here
13:19 - they have a huge video to show it and
13:21 - specifically
13:22 - you know they're showing big no i never
13:25 - really see
13:26 - ecommerce sites that have images that
13:28 - are this big
13:29 - and like i said it's to show how grand
13:32 - these products are
13:33 - you click on one of those products you
13:34 - see a huge you know
13:36 - demo video going on and it's amazing it
13:39 - looks beautiful
13:40 - it shows you a little bit of a demo here
13:41 - in 3d of that actual watch
13:43 - and shows you the different colors of
13:44 - the watch so it's a huge
13:46 - full full-on experience of every watch
13:48 - that you want to buy and that's not easy
13:50 - man like
13:51 - people had to actually think about this
13:53 - it looks amazing like
13:54 - if you're gonna walk if you're gonna
13:56 - wanna buy a watch that's pretty much
13:58 - three thousand five thousand ten
14:00 - thousand bucks
14:01 - you're gonna want to see a little bit of
14:03 - commitment from the guys
14:05 - that are pretty much building that brand
14:06 - you know what i mean so
14:08 - you know going deeper into all of this
14:11 - this is the rolex website that's a great
14:13 - example that you guys can follow if you
14:14 - guys are doing e-commerce if you guys
14:16 - are doing you know

14:48 - things going on
14:50 - we're gonna dive deep into new designs
14:52 - of 2020 and one of the biggest trends
14:55 - that i see
14:56 - in design right now in 2020 is gonna be
14:58 - without a doubt
14:59 - neomorphism hands down hands down to
15:02 - neomorphism why
15:03 - it sounds like a very very hard work uh
15:05 - word
15:06 - uh it's funny i'm saying here amanath
15:08 - he's saying yo frankie tesla and rolex
15:10 - must sponsor this life long a man i
15:12 - would love a rolex watch right now that
15:14 - would be amazing man
15:15 - it would just add so much to the whole
15:17 - experience but definitely
15:19 - so many people are giving love let us
15:21 - see people are saying no i mean the two
15:23 - he uses to write on top of the slides
15:25 - the tool that i use to
15:26 - to right on top of this lights is either
15:28 - screen brush or just a presentation tool
15:30 - in google slides so guys you can use
15:33 - that if you guys want
15:34 - that's dope blow the horn hey let's go
15:37 - man
15:39 - neomorphism i think is a great great
15:42 - type of style in 2020 and what is
15:46 - neomorphism
15:47 - specifically man it's kind of a weird
15:49 - word it's kind of a very
15:50 - you know a hard word i guess new means
15:54 - like literally new like something that
15:55 - is new brand new morphism means
15:58 - you know morphing means forming into
16:00 - something so
16:01 - forming into something new pretty much
16:03 - is the etymology of that word
16:05 - and what is it exactly right so how does
16:08 - neomorphism relate to
16:09 - skelemorphism the cool thing about
16:11 - neomorphism let me actually give my
16:13 - presentation
16:14 - tool right here neomorphism came from
16:17 - skeuomorphism
16:18 - and what the frick is that man as nasa
16:21 - would say
16:22 - so one of the most interesting things
16:24 - about neomorphism
16:25 - is that it draws from both skeuomorphism
16:28 - and other massively popular styles
16:30 - so to be completely you know i want to
16:33 - be kind of clear with you guys
16:34 - because these seem like really big ports
16:37 - but in reality they're pretty simple to
16:38 - understand
16:39 - and skeuomorphism pretty much is you
16:42 - know the fact that you're getting
16:43 - real world objects and putting them into
16:45 - design
16:46 - so you know making buttons seem 3d kind
16:49 - of like if you had a calculator
16:51 - and you know you're seeing the objects
16:54 - look a little bit 3d they have a little
16:55 - bit of shade
16:56 - that would make it more of the
16:58 - skeomorphism type of
17:00 - you know vibe if you're looking to make
17:02 - things a little bit more
17:04 - kind of like the real world but at the
17:06 - same time making the minimalistic and
17:07 - digital that's more of neomorphism so
17:09 - it's in between
17:10 - making them very flat and making them
17:12 - very you know
17:14 - real world alike so neomorphism is
17:16 - pretty much that it's in between
17:18 - skeuomorphism and flat
17:19 - design and so yep
17:23 - here here they go so skelmorphism and
17:25 - other massively popular designs such as
17:27 - flat design
17:28 - yes both of those are opposite to each
17:30 - other and neomorphism
17:32 - falls somewhere in between that's
17:33 - exactly what i just said
17:35 - and so one of the cool things about this
17:37 - is like
17:38 - okay so what does neomorphism look like
17:40 - in ui design and what can it do for your
17:42 - products we've got the full
17:44 - run through for you on this new trend so
17:47 - we're gonna dive
17:48 - deep into that what is neomorphism
17:49 - because there's so much text
17:51 - there's so much type of content going on
17:53 - to being thrown around
17:54 - love it love you guys people are saying
17:56 - docker bunny
17:57 - nice hello hello facebook awesome
18:01 - and apple website is awesome yep that's
18:03 - a great website with
18:05 - huge images with a little bit of
18:06 - neomorphism and
18:08 - we're going to explain how that is maybe
18:10 - i can actually visit it on this
18:12 - specific light so neomorphism was born
18:14 - from skeuomorphism and went on to create
18:17 - a new entire
18:18 - ux style designers from all over the
18:21 - world have
18:22 - seen catchy neomorphic designs on
18:25 - dribble
18:26 - and behance and now it's a trend on its
18:28 - own
18:29 - so those are great resources to actually
18:32 - look into i'm gonna hit
18:33 - on them a little bit later in the actual
18:36 - presentation but for now
18:37 - if you guys you know want to drop off
18:39 - because of whatever reason
18:41 - you got to take care of your dog or
18:42 - whatever that's going to be that's going
18:44 - to be a good excuse for you so
18:45 - neomorphism
18:46 - going specifically into it what is it
18:49 - let's break it down
18:50 - skeuomorphism is what i said before is a
18:52 - very 3d design so it's pretty much
18:54 - representing the real world but
18:56 - in design so if you can see this you
18:59 - know look at how
19:00 - they're adding the shades it goes from
19:02 - purple to e min
19:04 - even almost white and they're just
19:05 - showing that so that you can see the
19:07 - dimension of the buttons right
19:09 - and it's cool in in my opinion dude like
19:12 - it looks kind of
19:13 - old it looks kind of like early 2000s
19:16 - and even 90s
19:17 - i kind of like it but not really like i
19:19 - even like the flat design a little bit
19:21 - more i feel like this
19:22 - the flat design looks pretty freaking
19:25 - modern
19:26 - and you know neomorphism like i mean
19:28 - sorry skeuomorphism looks all
19:30 - really really old flat design is hip
19:33 - it's nice it's
19:34 - light you can pretty much see everything
19:36 - it doesn't have any shadows whatsoever
19:39 - so it might not even be that hard to
19:40 - design to be honest with you i haven't
19:42 - had experience with any flat design
19:44 - but at the same time i don't see any
19:46 - like i said shadows any dimension to it
19:48 - so it must be easier and so the cool
19:51 - thing about neomorphism
19:52 - is that there's so many videos right now
19:54 - actually so many people talking about it
19:56 - it might actually be one of the biggest
19:58 - trends
19:59 - in 2020 in design of ui and ux and even
20:02 - just web design
20:04 - all in all so that's what's cool about
20:06 - it so neomorphism
20:08 - if you can see this pretty much it's a
20:10 - combination between these two
20:12 - so it has the 3d aspects of it as you
20:14 - can see around this button
20:16 - you can see the shadow of it so it makes
20:18 - it seem like it's a real live
20:20 - button that you're clicking and this is
20:21 - pretty much a calculator example of it
20:23 - right here you don't see any type of
20:25 - dimension any type of shadow to it
20:27 - it seems like you're just clicking on
20:28 - something digital but right here it's
20:30 - like oh damn i got a real calculator in
20:32 - my hand
20:32 - right now neomorphism like i said is
20:34 - going to be in between flat design
20:36 - and between skeomorphism and it the the
20:39 - way that it works is that it doesn't
20:41 - give so much contrast
20:43 - around the actual experience of using
20:45 - that ui ux
20:46 - design and here you can see a lot of
20:49 - contrast
20:50 - right there's purple there's white a lot
20:52 - of different contrast that makes up the
20:54 - dimension of things right here
20:56 - you can see white and gray there's not
20:58 - that much contrast in between of that
21:00 - so that's why it's beautiful this uh
21:03 - this is another example of neomorphism
21:05 - right here
21:06 - so as you can see this specific
21:09 - you know display picture it's a flower
21:12 - or whatever it is
21:13 - it looks like it's popped up so just
21:15 - giving it
21:16 - the quality of it being something you
21:18 - know you can see the shadows here
21:20 - so it means that it's actually you know
21:22 - it's it's
21:23 - it's type of representing something in
21:24 - the real world it's like if there was a
21:26 - circle
21:26 - or window or something like that has the
21:28 - shadow right here makes it look
21:30 - really clean there's also a little white
21:32 - outline around this design right now
21:34 - then there's like gray right here so it
21:35 - gives it a lot of dimension
21:37 - but the cool thing about this is that
21:39 - whenever you do click on every button it
21:41 - just turns a little bit grayer or it
21:43 - turns blue
21:44 - and that specific you know low type of
21:46 - contrast it's what
21:48 - is going to make your design pop a lot
21:50 - so we're going from gray to blue
21:52 - that's what's going to actually you know
21:54 - kind of
21:55 - force you or kind of just show you
21:57 - around the whole design so let's move
21:59 - right ahead another
22:00 - big big thing right now let me just take
22:02 - a drink a little sip of this coffee
22:06 - it's gonna be dark mode everybody if
22:08 - you're a developer
22:09 - you know drop in the comments below if
22:11 - you guys really love the dark mode
22:13 - and specific text editors like visual
22:15 - studio code or maybe even eclipse maybe
22:17 - even
22:18 - you know jet beams jet brains all of
22:21 - these type of ides and text editors adam
22:23 - all of those
22:24 - so dark mode is dope not only because it
22:28 - looks really cool
22:28 - it actually has a lot of results tied
22:31 - behind it
22:32 - and what i want to show you guys i like
22:34 - this picture a lot
22:35 - just because it actually is uh it's an
22:38 - example of neomorphism and it's an
22:40 - example of dark mode
22:42 - because why guys can you guys tell me
22:44 - why this is an example of neomorphism
22:48 - drop in the comments below yep be a
22:49 - little bit engaged guys let's keep the
22:51 - energy up
22:52 - right now we are at 375 likes
22:55 - oh my god let's reach 400 likes guys
22:57 - come on thank you guys
22:59 - so much for being here we're almost at
23:01 - 400 concurrent viewers
23:03 - damn i love that type of engagement guys
23:05 - thank you so much
23:06 - vs code somebody's saying a huge pandey
23:09 - and
23:10 - voice low op so my voice is kind of low
23:12 - let's actually talk a little bit
23:14 - higher for you guys so dark mode is
23:16 - awesome
23:17 - just because i think it looks more
23:20 - appealing to the eye to be honest with
23:22 - you
23:22 - so i'll be like me personally i'll be a
23:25 - little bit more engaged with an
23:26 - interface that is kind of
23:27 - black instead of something that is
23:29 - really white because white kind of
23:31 - hurts my eyes and if you guys can see
23:33 - here my
23:34 - my iphone i'm going to show it to you
23:37 - guys it's the black
23:38 - and the dark mode iphone type of you
23:40 - know vibe i didn't want to use the white
23:43 - version one specifically if you're
23:46 - talking technically
23:47 - it just is going to save a lot of your
23:49 - battery life you know
23:50 - showing black pixels versus showing
23:52 - white pixels is just gonna
23:54 - save a little bit of your life oh man we
23:56 - got a two dollar donation by
23:58 - jason francis thank you so much man he
24:01 - says very informative
24:02 - good job team thank you so much brother
24:04 - we really really appreciate that i love
24:07 - it
24:07 - so dark mode is awesome because of what
24:09 - i said it does
24:10 - save a little bit of battery at the same
24:13 - time
24:14 - this design right here shows the
24:15 - neomorphic design of
24:17 - you know being popped up so this looks
24:19 - like an actual type of
24:21 - maybe even like a meter something like
24:23 - that this shows like it's separate from
24:25 - this like
24:25 - if it was put on top of it and then this
24:28 - circle makes it seem as
24:29 - as if it was clicked you know so all of
24:31 - these things add
24:32 - to the actual like human-like
24:34 - functionalities of design
24:36 - so i went into the rolex website but
24:39 - going into this specific presentation
24:42 - here this is another example of dark
24:44 - mode
24:44 - like i showed you guys right now this is
24:46 - how my iphone is so
24:48 - iphone recognizes this specifically so
24:51 - they let you
24:52 - go into you know whether that's the dark
24:54 - mode or the just the light mode the
24:56 - white mode
24:57 - that most that literally is the default
24:59 - mode but
25:00 - i think in the future probably dark mode
25:03 - is going to be the default
25:04 - you know so it's it's a very interesting
25:08 - thing man it's it's been picked up
25:10 - throughout the years
25:10 - people are loving it people are digging
25:12 - it some people cannot even use their
25:14 - text editor
25:15 - if it's not in dark mode man we just
25:16 - crossed the 400
25:18 - like mark in this video guys let's
25:20 - freaking
25:21 - go smash this like button if you guys
25:23 - are enjoying this content if you guys
25:25 - want to learn more about design ui ux
25:29 - web development and all of these things
25:31 - thank you guys
25:32 - so much it really feeds us to going
25:34 - forward with everything
25:36 - and man i'm having a blast here some
25:38 - people are asking where is sunny sunny's
25:40 - gonna be
25:40 - live next week he's going to be showing
25:42 - you guys how to build
25:44 - great projects with the mern stack so
25:47 - it's going to be a full stack
25:48 - development project using the burn stack
25:51 - and going to be creating projects such
25:52 - as whatsapp such as
25:55 - i'm not even sure amazon i believe in
25:57 - all of these things so
25:58 - they're gonna be great but going back
26:00 - into this like i mentioned before you
26:01 - know
26:02 - visual studio code in dark mode is
26:03 - awesome guys i cannot use it in just a
26:06 - regular white mode especially if you're
26:08 - using windows windows a lot of times
26:10 - uses just the white mode the normal
26:13 - default mode
26:14 - to me it's so hard to engage in a in a
26:16 - text editor if i'm using this dark mode
26:18 - is awesome most developers do like it
26:20 - and why is dark mode awesome like does
26:22 - it just look awesome or is there
26:24 - actual real benefits to it well let me
26:27 - share that with you guys in the next
26:28 - slide
26:29 - the cool thing about dark mode is that
26:31 - not only does it look better in my
26:33 - opinion
26:34 - it's also it's shown to have so much
26:37 - more results guys
26:38 - this is insane i saw this picture in my
26:41 - mind
26:41 - was blown like actually drop a
26:44 - mind-blown emoji
26:45 - on the chat below if you guys are liking
26:48 - this
26:49 - so this is an eye tracking test and
26:51 - these pretty much if you see the
26:53 - green you see the red all around is a
26:56 - heat map and what that means
26:58 - is that it shows the actual the
27:01 - user's path inside of this app right so
27:04 - it shows the interactivity that the user
27:06 - has had within the app
27:07 - so everything that turns a little bit
27:09 - more red means that the user has clicked
27:11 - on that way more than something that is
27:13 - just green
27:13 - so green is just like casual casual type
27:16 - of like
27:16 - you know pointing on those things but
27:19 - red is like where most of the users
27:21 - actually hit so
27:25 - man beautiful somebody says 361 people
27:28 - watching 448
27:30 - likes that's a love bro thank you guys i
27:33 - appreciate
27:34 - that let's reach the 500 sorry the 500
27:37 - like mark and also just hit the 10
27:40 - mark maybe in chat donations guys thank
27:43 - you so much
27:44 - i'm going to show you guys how to
27:45 - implement all of these design
27:47 - trends into your own designs this year
27:50 - so that you can get paid so that you can
27:51 - get jobs so that your designs
27:53 - and your portfolio actually goes to the
27:56 - next level
27:57 - because ultimately that's what we want
27:59 - we want to see results we want to make
28:00 - this knowledge
28:01 - practical so as i was saying you can see
28:04 - here that the white ui
28:06 - wow people are kind of hitting
28:09 - everywhere man so if you see this
28:10 - people are hitting the red the green you
28:13 - know
28:14 - things all around all around that means
28:16 - people are not engaging in one specific
28:18 - area that much
28:19 - right so they're hitting all around here
28:21 - all around here they don't know where to
28:22 - click
28:23 - but in the black and the dark ui design
28:26 - people are actually hitting here a lot
28:28 - because it's red
28:29 - here a lot because it's red red you can
28:32 - see red red red red red and they're kind
28:34 - of playing with these other things that
28:35 - are more yellow
28:36 - yellow is obviously more warmer than
28:39 - green so that means people are hitting
28:40 - the yellow spots more than the green so
28:44 - using statistics using actual diagrams
28:48 - using
28:48 - actual information people
28:52 - are actually better directed using dark
28:54 - mode than using white mode
28:56 - and this is a prime example of this
28:59 - you can develop an ad or i'm sorry an
29:01 - app probably use
29:02 - dark design in that sense dark ui
29:05 - apparently shows
29:06 - so much many more results so let's keep
29:09 - going on
29:10 - another big trend this year that i
29:13 - pretty much
29:13 - freaking love man is using illustrations
29:16 - in ui
29:17 - and ux so it's funny because
29:20 - you know we're moving more towards the
29:21 - digital era we're moving more towards
29:24 - the clean type of vibe
29:26 - clean type of modern designs but at the
29:29 - end of the day
29:30 - 2019 actually was the day was the year
29:33 - where people were going a little bit
29:35 - deeper into oh wow give me some of that
29:38 - you know new type of digital design that
29:40 - is very clean very minimalistic
29:42 - now what's going on in 2020 is the fact
29:45 - that people
29:46 - are going back to the roots pretty much
29:49 - people are using illustrations a lot
29:52 - people are using
29:53 - human-like design a lot people are using
29:55 - photos a lot so
29:56 - even i mean even i've seen you know
30:00 - people do graffiti typography or maybe
30:03 - even just
30:03 - handwriting typography instead of builds
30:06 - instead of designs
30:07 - and people are digging it so much we're
30:09 - seeing so many results from that
30:10 - this is another example of illustration
30:13 - being used
30:14 - in ui and ux so these illustrations you
30:17 - can do in different ways
30:18 - i would suggest using just adobe
30:20 - illustrator i think it's a
30:22 - dope dope tool i loved it man
30:25 - once i knew adobe illustrator i kind of
30:27 - didn't want to go back to photoshop just
30:28 - because it's
30:29 - it's so interesting like so intuitive in
30:31 - the way that like you would interact
30:33 - it's like kind of like a
30:34 - i don't know do you guys have ever used
30:36 - windows paint
30:38 - but windows paint was so fun for me when
30:40 - i was a young child
30:41 - the thing about it about adobe
30:43 - illustrator is that it's
30:44 - pretty much windows paint on steroids so
30:47 - you can pretty much do
30:48 - a lot of things with it and i bet you
30:50 - guys most
30:51 - or a lot of the designs that you see are
30:53 - done with that specific tool so adobe
30:55 - illustrator is going to be
30:56 - one cool thing about it another great
30:59 - great trend going on right now in ui and
31:02 - ux is gonna be the onboarding experience
31:04 - that you give
31:05 - your users and why do i say that just
31:08 - because
31:08 - man if you're actually creating svg
31:11 - grabbing the eyes people are saying
31:13 - so svg is a type of file and i think
31:16 - it's it's a very it's one of the best
31:18 - files that you can get in your designs
31:20 - in my opinion because you can stretch
31:21 - them out as
31:23 - far as you want or stretch them down as
31:25 - far as you want and they'll always keep
31:27 - that you know
31:27 - very clean quality non-pixelated quality
31:30 - to them
31:31 - so what about adobe xd so adobe xd
31:34 - is dope for prototyping i'm going to go
31:36 - over other prototyping tools
31:38 - later in the video and we're going to
31:40 - touch on that so people like nero k are
31:42 - saying love dark mode
31:43 - storyboard which software he is using
31:47 - so i'm pretty much using i'm literally
31:49 - just using you know google slides to
31:50 - show you guys everything that i'm doing
31:51 - right now
31:52 - what else is going on right here is that
31:54 - tracking for desktop or mobile
31:56 - so that dragon specifically was for
31:58 - desktop and that's the dark
32:00 - mode tracking that i was talking about
32:02 - so diving deep into the onboarding
32:04 - experience guys
32:05 - if you guys are making a new app you
32:07 - kind of have to give directions on how
32:08 - to use that app
32:10 - not only give directions but i like this
32:12 - specific diagram or picture
32:13 - because people are using a lot of things
32:15 - inside of this so
32:16 - what do i mean by that they're using
32:18 - illustration guys to show you
32:20 - how to use this app you know let's
32:23 - make apps a little bit more human this
32:26 - year it's not all about being digital
32:28 - it's not all about being clean and
32:29 - minimalistic it's about
32:30 - giving that human functionality to it
32:32 - that's what's going to get people to use
32:34 - your app a little bit more
32:36 - so they're using illustrations they're
32:38 - using
32:39 - right here you know reference
32:40 - experiences of how it's loading and all
32:42 - of these things
32:43 - so show you guys show other people that
32:45 - are using your app how to use your app
32:47 - and this is an example that i really
32:48 - really love duolingo is one of the
32:50 - biggest
32:51 - language apps in the world right now so
32:54 - let's go into this website
32:55 - let's see how these guys are handling
32:57 - their marketing their
32:58 - you know user experience user interface
33:01 - the cool thing about them is that i see
33:02 - off the bat you can see these guys are
33:04 - using illustration
33:05 - so you're trying to make it so that you
33:08 - know the most amount of people use your
33:10 - app so
33:10 - what is going to make it so that most
33:12 - amount of people use your app maybe
33:14 - you're going to want to use
33:14 - illustrations because at the same time
33:16 - you're going to be hitting kids
33:17 - you're going to be hitting teenagers
33:18 - you're going to be hitting adults with
33:20 - very friendly animations so we dive deep
33:23 - into this
33:24 - and oh my god we're 300 concurrent
33:27 - viewers thank you guys
33:28 - so much for sticking around here we're
33:30 - also almost at 500 likes on this video
33:32 - we're at 487 specifically thank you guys
33:36 - so much it's it's crazy man but going
33:38 - deep into duolingo
33:40 - you guys can see here that man
33:43 - illustrations
33:44 - are king right now so you can choose
33:46 - here whatever language you want
33:47 - and besides that these guys are actually
33:50 - showing you how to
33:51 - you know how to be on board in their
33:53 - specific app right so they're
33:55 - teaching you how to use it so teaching
33:57 - you that it has personalized learning
33:59 - it has it re it receives immediate
34:01 - grading
34:02 - it stays it keeps you you know motivated
34:05 - with results they give you
34:06 - trophies they show you improvements oh
34:09 - man we're at 500 likes guys let's go
34:12 - love it thank you so much for the love
34:14 - man we're gonna learn a lot during this
34:16 - presentation right now
34:17 - i hope you guys actually take it into
34:19 - practice actually put all of these
34:21 - things into your portfolio into your
34:23 - apps that you're building and i'm going
34:24 - to be showing you how we've implemented
34:26 - all of these things into our own
34:28 - builds in the last builds we've made
34:30 - with sunny with qazi
34:32 - so let's keep the love going let's keep
34:34 - the energy up guys
34:36 - like i said this is kind of their
34:37 - onboarding experience if you would look
34:39 - at it on the app it would look a little
34:40 - bit different
34:41 - but it still gives directions and it
34:43 - keeps everything very illustrative
34:45 - so like i said it hits a lot of
34:47 - different demographics not only
34:49 - young people but also old people it
34:50 - makes it very very friendly
34:52 - so let's go back to the actual
34:54 - presentation guys
34:55 - like i said this was a great example
34:57 - that i want to show you but
34:59 - there's other ones right so the
35:01 - onboarding experience
35:02 - like i said this is another example
35:04 - right here people are using
35:05 - illustrations like
35:06 - freaking crazy man so illustrations
35:10 - this is what i'm going to say
35:11 - neomorphism illustrations
35:14 - big pictures all of those things
35:17 - specifically with
35:18 - more variable type of fonts what do i
35:20 - mean by that i'll go deeper into that in
35:22 - the other part of the presentation
35:24 - but i feel like those things right now
35:26 - are the biggest things in design
35:27 - right now and the fact is that not only
35:30 - does it look good
35:32 - it brings results people would not use
35:34 - them if you don't bring results let's
35:36 - say
35:36 - let's talk about the meditation app
35:38 - headspace so headspace
35:40 - their whole marketing is pretty much
35:42 - done on
35:44 - what is it let's let's actually see if
35:45 - we can pull it up here so
35:47 - headspace is going to be interesting
35:49 - because it just sold
35:51 - as a million as a sorry billion dollar
35:54 - company guys billion dollar company
35:57 - these guys what are they using for their
36:00 - for their marketing for their
36:01 - presentation you can see here
36:03 - there's a lot of illustration around
36:05 - human photography so like i said
36:07 - big photos are in right now
36:09 - illustrations are in right now
36:11 - you know it shows you it gives you a
36:13 - little bit of direction of what you're
36:14 - gonna do with that app
36:16 - it shows you how the app looks it looks
36:18 - very friendly these are
36:19 - all animations here all the animations
36:22 - here it's kind of like the dark mode
36:23 - they're hitting the dark mode too
36:25 - so everybody kind of knows all of these
36:27 - things they're applying it to their
36:28 - builds
36:29 - so what are you guys doing if you're not
36:30 - applying to that so that's just one
36:32 - example that i
36:33 - really really like so going deeper into
36:36 - our builds how we've applied all of
36:37 - these things inside of our
36:39 - our own design is guys
36:42 - i want to say sunny is a freaking killer
36:44 - like he has been implementing this this
36:47 - is literally
36:47 - if you guys go to this url you can see
36:49 - our netflix clone which we built a few
36:51 - live streams back
36:53 - this is not the real netflix this is
36:55 - what we created
36:56 - as our solution to clone the netflix you
36:59 - know
36:59 - website right now so i'm gonna make it a
37:01 - little bit smaller for you guys the cool
37:03 - thing about this
37:03 - is that you know you you're going over
37:06 - this
37:07 - so one of the biggest things in design
37:09 - right now
37:10 - in 2020 is going to be subtle animations
37:13 - and the cool thing about solo animations
37:15 - is the fact that it pretty much
37:16 - directs the way that you move around
37:18 - this app right so
37:20 - going into you know all of these type of
37:23 - films it shows me that my cursor is
37:25 - being responsive to the film that i'm
37:26 - being on top of
37:28 - so it's actually you know blowing it up
37:30 - a little bit it's making it a little bit
37:32 - bigger
37:32 - it makes it seem as if like the app and
37:35 - i
37:36 - were connected somehow so if i want to
37:38 - click on it
37:40 - so i guess right now we don't have the
37:42 - functionality on but normally if we do
37:44 - click on it it would show the trailers
37:46 - let me see
37:46 - so it's going to show this trailer not
37:48 - everything has trailers but apparently
37:49 - this one does
37:50 - so i'm going to hit it it becomes very
37:52 - interactive and then it shows that
37:54 - so that's one of the ways that we
37:56 - implemented these subtle designs that
37:58 - are so
37:59 - in they're so they're freaking hot right
38:02 - now they're so hip
38:03 - in 2020 ui ux designs another way that
38:06 - we implemented all of this
38:08 - is with the hulu website so i actually
38:10 - want to go into it let me see if we
38:12 - actually have
38:13 - so apparently we don't have the the the
38:15 - url
38:16 - but i'll drop it here so it's going to
38:18 - be it's going to be this
38:20 - specifically and this is the website
38:22 - that we built
38:23 - and we built it about two days ago i was
38:26 - live with sunny
38:27 - and this channel specifically if you
38:28 - guys want to learn how to build a hulu
38:30 - app
38:30 - go a few days back and check out this
38:32 - specific live stream
38:34 - but even in this hulu clones sunny made
38:36 - a clone from hulu
38:38 - and as you can see as i'm hovering over
38:40 - it let's make it a little bit smaller so
38:42 - you guys can actually see more
38:44 - more videos or movies in the actual the
38:46 - website so
38:47 - if you go on top of it you can see that
38:49 - the like the date of publishing and then
38:52 - the type of
38:53 - movie or series it is it's gonna show
38:55 - here
38:56 - so you know like i said before hovering
38:59 - over specific things making it
39:02 - like have subtle animation it's going to
39:03 - direct your user onto how to use your
39:06 - specific app man
39:07 - so if i hover over it's going to show me
39:09 - that it has 78 likes it was released at
39:12 - this time and it's a movie
39:14 - so it's telling you you know it's it's
39:16 - actually being connected with the way
39:18 - that you interact with that app and
39:19 - that's
39:20 - why subtle animations are so important
39:23 - this year
39:24 - in 2020 so that was the hulu app that
39:27 - was a netflix app now we're gonna go
39:29 - into another big big trend in ui ux
39:32 - design
39:33 - in freaking 2020 we're at 400 or sorry
39:36 - 538 likes in this video guys
39:38 - let's freaking go love it thank you guys
39:42 - so much we're gonna hit 600
39:45 - in a few seconds so what do you guys
39:48 - want to learn
39:49 - you know we're trying to dissect the
39:50 - biggest companies out there in the world
39:52 - for you guys so you guys can learn
39:54 - take practical knowledge from it and
39:56 - practically
39:57 - put them into your portfolio and get
39:59 - results like
40:00 - getting a job like creating beautiful
40:02 - websites that everybody can use and
40:04 - interactive websites that people are
40:06 - gonna enjoy using
40:07 - so let's go right into it so another
40:10 - cool thing is that
40:11 - gradients are super in right now so
40:14 - i'm giving you guys an example right now
40:16 - of face up sorry facebook
40:18 - i mean facebook does on instagram but at
40:20 - the same time you know in
40:21 - instagram right here you can see how
40:23 - it's using a gradient
40:25 - so it goes from here let me get my
40:27 - pointer tool so it goes from here
40:29 - to this to this so i remember at the
40:32 - beginning i didn't really like
40:33 - how instagram looked but at the same
40:36 - time i kind of grow into it man
40:39 - it looks really dope you know adding
40:40 - gradients to it adds a lot of dimension
40:42 - adds a lot of personality to your
40:44 - specific builds to your specific
40:46 - um design you know it makes it look very
40:50 - very classy
40:52 - somebody asked would you be teaching us
40:53 - neomorphism yeah my man
40:55 - i'll go deeper into it in other videos
40:57 - some people say what can i do after
40:58 - react.js
40:59 - so after react.js you can actually use
41:01 - react.js to
41:02 - use these specific tools that i'm
41:04 - talking about like i showed you guys
41:06 - we're using you know subtle animations
41:08 - in
41:09 - the the hulu clone in the netflix zone
41:12 - we're also using gradient
41:13 - type of tools in the hulu clone so if
41:16 - you see the background of the hulu clone
41:17 - that i just showed
41:18 - it has a gradient to it because it shows
41:20 - a lot of dimension it shows a lot of
41:22 - it's kind of like a very modern vibe and
41:24 - we are at 550 likes on this video guys
41:27 - let's freaking go let's grow this to 600
41:30 - likes thank you guys
41:31 - so much i really appreciate this let's
41:33 - make the best design that we can make
41:35 - so that people can actually use our
41:37 - websites so
41:38 - this is another example of gradients
41:41 - spotify
41:42 - one of the biggest brands in music in
41:44 - the world right now
41:45 - shout out to you guys because you guys
41:47 - just bought joe rogan's podcast for
41:48 - about a hundred million dollars damn
41:50 - that's a little bit of money man that's
41:52 - beautiful
41:52 - thankfully joe rogan you know accepted
41:55 - that freaking
41:56 - that deal man because that's a lot of
41:58 - money so one of the biggest
42:00 - websites in music right now in this
42:03 - moment are using gradients
42:05 - huge amounts of gradients because why it
42:07 - makes it look clean
42:08 - it makes it look like there's depth it
42:11 - makes it look
42:12 - like it's so professional it's not just
42:14 - plain color i'm not saying plain color
42:17 - looks bad i'm just saying that gradients
42:19 - look really
42:20 - really good and everybody's using them
42:22 - so this is another example of a ui ux
42:25 - of a specific type of you know statistic
42:28 - tool
42:29 - and this is how they use gradients as
42:31 - you can see here things are a little bit
42:32 - lighter and things go
42:34 - boom a little bit darker to show the
42:36 - actual you know the
42:37 - the focusing of things how things grow
42:39 - so as you can see here it's purple and
42:41 - it's turning
42:42 - blue this is the gradient in itself also
42:45 - you know you can see the bars turning
42:47 - into gradients so it's a great way to
42:49 - show
42:49 - data you know you don't always have to
42:52 - have data
42:52 - being so plain and simple just you know
42:54 - maybe showing green to red
42:56 - you can show green to yellow to orange
42:59 - to red
43:00 - and when you do that type of gradient
43:01 - it's going to show so much more
43:04 - specific you know so much more specific
43:06 - progress and growth from it
43:08 - i see people see people here say uh
43:11 - devin gray actually what's up devon we
43:13 - talked on the phone man you remember me
43:14 - so joe rogan got paid and now there's no
43:17 - money left to pay joe biden
43:18 - and his podcast that's funny kind of
43:21 - political
43:21 - let's not jump into that but i love joe
43:23 - rogan and i wanted to mention it because
43:25 - spotify
43:26 - is killer and the cool thing about
43:28 - gradients is like i said it's being used
43:30 - all over the world
43:31 - so this is a website called radiant and
43:33 - i added it here because i love the way
43:36 - that this gradient
43:37 - look specifically and obviously guys
43:40 - you guys are not going to be able to mix
43:42 - weird colors
43:43 - if they just don't go together obviously
43:46 - you know you're going to make a gradient
43:47 - off of things that look good
43:49 - so off of the bat you know white
43:52 - turns to blue turns to purple turns to
43:54 - red turns to pink
43:56 - and that's just kind of natural but if
43:58 - you're trying to make you know
43:59 - brown turns to blue turns to
44:02 - orange turns to red it just really
44:05 - doesn't go
44:06 - you kind of have to follow color theory
44:08 - and i'll be i'm going to be touching
44:09 - about that in the next few slides
44:11 - but these are pretty much just examples
44:13 - of the gradients itself
44:14 - so like i said before guys you know it's
44:17 - not all about using gradients it's also
44:19 - about making your design looks cool so
44:21 - what i liked about this picture is that
44:24 - if you're looking to make you know
44:26 - mobile websites right now in this moment
44:28 - the cool thing about it is that
44:30 - you know first off these are
44:33 - complementary colors right
44:35 - color theory is super important if you
44:36 - guys don't know that stick to the end so
44:38 - that i can explain that to you because
44:40 - if you learn that if you learn color
44:42 - theory
44:42 - man you're gonna become a pro developer
44:44 - you're gonna learn how developers
44:46 - sorry designers think specifically and
44:49 - that's gonna
44:50 - bring you to the next level then you're
44:51 - gonna be like yo that's insane that's
44:53 - not how that color goes with this color
44:55 - whoa let's go getting a great donation
44:59 - by conscious code
45:01 - and he's donating 200 indian rupees
45:03 - thank you so much my brother
45:04 - and he is saying is that web development
45:07 - let me actually pull
45:08 - this specific let me pull it up right
45:11 - here guys
45:12 - so yup conscious code is saying
45:17 - um let's pull it up right here give me
45:20 - one second guys
45:22 - so
45:27 - boom it's taking me a second but you
45:29 - guys are gonna see and it's gonna be
45:30 - worth that
45:32 - so conscious code is saying is that
45:36 - let me pull it up so you guys can see it
45:38 - a little bit bigger is that
45:39 - web development is going to be automated
45:42 - by ai
45:43 - and there will be no jobs in this field
45:46 - and the field of ai
45:47 - machine learning will boom compared to
45:49 - web dev
45:51 - so my man airing went into
45:54 - a little bit more into you know ctp3 i
45:57 - believe gtp3
45:58 - i believe it's called and there's ways
46:02 - for you know right now specific
46:04 - intelligence artificial intelligence or
46:06 - or actual programs to pretty much write
46:08 - code for you
46:10 - the thing about you know moving into the
46:12 - future is that
46:13 - you know robots are gonna have to kind
46:15 - of you know
46:17 - kind of catch up to this thing man we
46:19 - are still very much more advanced it's
46:21 - gonna take
46:21 - a few years for robots to just literally
46:24 - take over
46:24 - you know web development in general at
46:27 - the same time man
46:28 - design and trends and interactivity is
46:31 - always moving forward
46:32 - very very fast so you know robots are
46:34 - gonna have to catch up to that we're
46:36 - gonna have to program
46:37 - robots to learn these new techniques so
46:40 - man just just forget about all of that
46:43 - bro just grow your skills right now
46:45 - you know ultimately grow your skills
46:47 - make them very sellable skills high
46:48 - income skills
46:49 - that developers that companies can use
46:52 - and you'll never
46:53 - face the fact that you like you might
46:55 - have to look for other jobs if your
46:56 - skills are good enough
46:57 - then you'll be good bro don't worry
46:59 - about the robots don't worry about the
47:00 - ai
47:01 - and machine learning taking over your
47:03 - jobs if anything
47:05 - make sure that you learn those type of
47:06 - you know techniques and technologies so
47:08 - that you can apply them whether that's
47:10 - to your web development your apps or
47:12 - even just you know
47:13 - the work that you're doing in that
47:14 - specific moment but moving forward guys
47:16 - let's go into it so augmented reality is
47:20 - going to be a huge huge huge part of
47:23 - ui ux design in 2020 and why do i say
47:25 - that
47:26 - you know damn guys we're almost about to
47:28 - hit the 600 like mark
47:30 - in this video that's gonna be insane
47:32 - thank you guys so
47:33 - so much we're gonna be having a lot of
47:35 - fun talking about all of these different
47:37 - topics
47:38 - there's so much to talk about so much
47:40 - you know spice that i want to sprinkle
47:42 - into it augmented reality is
47:44 - dope just because of a few things i
47:46 - think it's
47:47 - very very practical i was i remember
47:49 - guys i was in
47:50 - i was in charlottesville virginia and i
47:52 - was in my cousin's
47:54 - uh company and their company was
47:56 - willowtree apps will treat applications
47:58 - and they're one of the biggest they're
48:00 - the one of the biggest big boys
48:02 - playing in the app development world in
48:04 - the east coast of the us so they're
48:06 - based out of virginia a lot of people
48:07 - don't know but virginia is a huge
48:10 - a huge hub for technology and why is
48:12 - that
48:13 - because they paid developers so much
48:15 - around
48:16 - 100k plus but the living expenses in
48:19 - virginia
48:20 - are just so low there's nothing compared
48:22 - to the to to california i live in
48:24 - california i'm in l.a right now beverly
48:25 - hills
48:26 - with kazi and all the team right now and
48:28 - that's amazing it's a blessing but at
48:30 - the same time sometimes i wish
48:31 - that the living expenses was not as high
48:33 - as somewhere as virginia
48:35 - and i was looking at specifically what
48:38 - is it called the microsoft
48:40 - the the helmet the the ar helmet
48:44 - augmented reality helmet i forgot what
48:46 - it's called guys but at the same time
48:48 - what was cool about it is that augmented
48:50 - reality adds a lot of depth to the
48:52 - specific you know reality of your vision
48:54 - that you're looking at
48:55 - now so if i'm looking at this computer
48:57 - so in front of me
48:58 - there's a computer in front of me right
49:00 - here and you guys can't see it but it's
49:01 - a laptop but let's say maybe this
49:03 - monitor because you guys can see it
49:04 - so the cool thing about this is that if
49:06 - i have something related to augmented
49:08 - reality whether that's an
49:09 - app or an actual helmet i could be able
49:12 - to place
49:13 - things on top of this maybe on top of
49:14 - the screen because it it responds to
49:17 - dimension
49:18 - and the cool thing about augmented
49:19 - reality is that we've seen it let's
49:22 - let's read a little bit about this
49:23 - specifically but we've seen huge
49:25 - companies
49:25 - use it it's not it's not oculus devin
49:28 - gray is saying i think it's called
49:31 - man let's let's actually let's actually
49:34 - research it guys let's take some time to
49:35 - research this so it's microsoft
49:38 - um ar helmet
49:41 - it's called hololens that's what it's
49:44 - called so it's called hololens
49:46 - so i was there i was using the hololens
49:49 - man
49:49 - was that mind-blowing guys the cool
49:52 - thing about that is that i could
49:53 - literally reach
49:54 - to you know literally i could just reach
49:57 - my hand
49:58 - like this and the helmet would kind of
49:59 - pick up my fingers and whenever i would
50:00 - snap
50:02 - snap a menu would appear and i could
50:05 - actually choose what to do with that
50:06 - specific you know floating object
50:08 - whatever
50:09 - augmented reality object that was inside
50:11 - of my view so
50:12 - let's say just to give you guys a
50:14 - perspective about this
50:15 - let's say i'm here in this in this
50:17 - screen right now and i want to put a
50:18 - little bit
50:19 - maybe a world maybe a ballerina on top
50:21 - of this which those were
50:23 - specific graphics that i was looking at
50:24 - if i want to put a world on top of this
50:26 - i would just go like
50:27 - so i would literally snap my fingers
50:29 - like this and i could see a menu pop off
50:32 - out of here and keep in mind that i'm
50:34 - that i'm wearing a
50:36 - freaking helmet that has lenses to it
50:38 - and if i look over here i can see the
50:40 - little world
50:41 - you know floating around or maybe the
50:42 - ballerina flowing around but the way
50:44 - that i would do it is
50:45 - i would snap my fingers and i would
50:47 - choose it in the menu
50:49 - so it gives depth to the actual reality
50:51 - and how are companies using this
50:53 - so let's read a little bit about this in
50:55 - the last years
50:56 - we have seen a lot of progress
50:58 - excitement and improvement
50:59 - of augmented reality ar the world's
51:02 - leading tech companies are investing
51:03 - millions into ar development
51:05 - so we should expect to expand and grow
51:08 - this
51:08 - this technology in 2020. even apple has
51:11 - introduced their own
51:12 - augmented reality toolkit called ar
51:16 - arkit ar kids to help designers and
51:18 - developers build ar based
51:20 - products dope apple not losing time
51:24 - anytime soon i love it man guys
51:27 - we are at 620 likes on this video that
51:30 - is insane
51:31 - wow thank you guys so much it would be
51:33 - mind blowing to me that we can reach the
51:35 - 1000 likes in this video
51:37 - it's insane so i actually came up with
51:40 - this title this morning
51:41 - i kind of just woke up and i was like
51:43 - damn my alarms didn't go off like
51:45 - holy i'm late to this but i'm
51:48 - so
51:48 - so passionate about design just because
51:50 - i've seen so much
51:51 - effect on it so much type of so much
51:55 - influence that i've brought into other
51:56 - people's lives with design
51:58 - and you know apps in general are used
52:01 - just because of the design of them
52:03 - like ultimately you know the
52:04 - functionalities of an app is going to be
52:06 - what's more important than
52:07 - that specific ad but if you do know
52:09 - design
52:10 - then that's just going to take that
52:12 - functionality of that app to another
52:14 - level
52:15 - so if you team up if you're a designer
52:17 - like a web
52:18 - like a web designer with a web developer
52:20 - or maybe you know an
52:21 - app designer with a app developer
52:24 - something related to that map you guys
52:26 - can make a killer killer team
52:28 - so augmented reality is huge let's look
52:31 - into this so ikea
52:32 - is using augmented reality ikea as you
52:35 - guys know
52:35 - is one of the biggest if not the biggest
52:39 - furniture brand in the whole
52:43 - world these guys are i believe they're
52:44 - from denmark uh they're from eastern
52:46 - europe for sure
52:48 - but the cool thing about them is that
52:49 - they're bringing this minimalistic
52:50 - design and also
52:52 - you know using more economic materials
52:54 - to build
52:55 - furniture and that's why they're so so
52:57 - big the cool thing about them is that in
53:00 - their website
53:01 - let me actually put up pull up my
53:02 - pointer here in their website
53:04 - they're showing you guys how a specific
53:07 - sofa would look
53:08 - in your space so this is the space that
53:10 - the person has in that house
53:11 - and they're using ar they're literally
53:14 - using ar to show you
53:15 - how that couch will look in your house
53:18 - so if you add ar to your design it's
53:21 - just gonna take it to the
53:22 - next next level that's insane
53:26 - and so zara i know zara is literally the
53:30 - third or the fourth
53:31 - biggest company in the world right now
53:33 - just because i didn't know this guys did
53:34 - you guys know this drop it in the
53:36 - comments below if you knew this
53:37 - but textile companies companies that
53:39 - have to do with clothes
53:42 - so textile companies the owner of sarah
53:44 - is like
53:45 - the fourth or the fifth or the sixth
53:47 - it's one of the it's like literally one
53:49 - of the top 10
53:50 - most richest persons in the world
53:52 - because not only does he
53:53 - and he's a spanish dude he's from spain
53:55 - not only does he own
53:57 - zara but he owns so many other textile
53:59 - companies so
54:00 - clothes are sold a lot in the world
54:02 - apparently and
54:03 - these guys wanted to use augmented
54:05 - reality to show you
54:07 - how clothes would fit on you so i don't
54:09 - have a specific demo of that but you
54:11 - know
54:12 - this is forbes making a freaking article
54:14 - about this
54:15 - it's a huge man i'm telling you you know
54:17 - you add ar
54:18 - to these specific selling websites and
54:21 - it's gonna
54:22 - man it the sales are just gonna go
54:24 - through the roof it's insane
54:25 - so zara like i said one of the biggest
54:27 - companies in the world for textiles
54:29 - and oh my god we just got another
54:32 - donation from enough aurora thank you so
54:35 - much brother
54:36 - he's donating 20 indian rupees i love it
54:39 - thank you so much man
54:40 - drop a question guys if you guys are
54:42 - doing some donations i would love to
54:43 - answer those
54:44 - also let's check out what's going on in
54:46 - the chat right now
54:48 - so devin gray again he says they were
54:50 - one of the first companies i remember
54:52 - that use they are
54:53 - i think he's talking about ikea yep ikea
54:56 - is
54:56 - super proactive in everything that is
54:58 - going on in technology right now
55:00 - so multilingual programmer says i read
55:02 - that future websites will use blockchain
55:04 - yep a lot of websites will
55:06 - move into blockchain not only websites
55:08 - but other technologies such as music
55:10 - and another thing oh man somebody said
55:13 - microsoft hololens yep
55:15 - that is true bro everybody was saying
55:17 - hololens hololens
55:18 - lux mikani also said hololens yeah
55:20 - poland is awesome
55:21 - guys i never knew how cool it was until
55:24 - i used it
55:25 - moving forward guys augmented reality is
55:27 - though because other big companies like
55:29 - coca-cola are using them right now so
55:31 - let's say
55:32 - you know b2c which is business to
55:35 - consumer type of um
55:37 - type of businesses are really really big
55:39 - right now specifically we are a b2c type
55:41 - of business you know
55:42 - we are a business that sells two
55:45 - consumers which are
55:46 - people that want to become developers
55:47 - like you guys you know we help consumers
55:49 - or
55:50 - just normal people become developers and
55:52 - how do we do that
55:54 - you know if you guys are enjoying this
55:55 - content we do have the link in the
55:56 - description below
55:58 - sorry about that to become a a specific
56:01 - javascript
56:02 - developer and you guys can kill it with
56:03 - your javascript skills
56:05 - with your web development skills with
56:07 - this course specifically and we teach
56:08 - you how to become a full stack
56:10 - javascript developer learning react
56:12 - learning technology such as es6
56:15 - such as javascript in general but little
56:17 - javascript all of these things
56:19 - and we have a free training down below
56:22 - in the comments below sorry in the
56:23 - description below
56:24 - if you guys are interested in that but
56:27 - you know
56:27 - these guys coca-cola are using b2b type
56:31 - of technology so they're selling
56:33 - business to business so they're selling
56:35 - to other businesses
56:36 - and actually showing them how a specific
56:39 - you know coca-cola machine would look in
56:41 - their business so let's say this is a
56:43 - grocery market you put your phone right
56:45 - here and you can see
56:46 - how that specific machine would look in
56:49 - your store
56:49 - so they're using ar to sell
56:53 - business to business that is insane guys
56:56 - love it i love it so much so we're gonna
56:59 - dive a little bit deeper
57:00 - into the design process right so this
57:03 - image is a little bit small i couldn't
57:05 - make it bigger for you guys
57:06 - but let's kind of dive into it i feel
57:08 - like you know some people want to have a
57:10 - clear view on how to create these type
57:12 - of designs
57:13 - because we've thrown a lot of
57:14 - information out there so
57:16 - you know in the beginning what i would
57:18 - advise man
57:19 - in whatever field that you guys are in
57:21 - empathizing is a really really smart and
57:24 - a huge
57:25 - skill that it's very hard to learn so
57:27 - being empathetic
57:28 - learning how people are feeling in the
57:30 - moment even gary v talks about this a
57:32 - lot you know empathy is great
57:34 - if you're a salesperson if you're into
57:36 - marketing if you're into web development
57:39 - if you're into app development if you're
57:41 - into just computer
57:43 - science in general so the cool thing
57:45 - about this is that
57:46 - you have to empathize in the beginning
57:48 - of your journey of the design journey
57:51 - so what do i mean by that so in
57:53 - empathizing what you're gonna do
57:55 - is you're actually gonna feel and think
57:58 - how your user is feeling and thinking
58:00 - because if you can't have that then
58:02 - you're gonna make an app that nobody
58:03 - wants to use
58:04 - you know ultimately apps are dictated
58:06 - and their design is dictated
58:08 - on how people will interact with them so
58:10 - you if you make it like
58:13 - let's say an app was really based off of
58:15 - this so
58:16 - you know apple really does have a thing
58:18 - that says you know
58:19 - we'll make the ability for each user to
58:23 - do whatever they want in just three
58:24 - clicks right
58:26 - so they've said something very similar
58:27 - to that if i want to check my messages
58:29 - or my notifications i don't have to do
58:31 - like eight clicks to get to there
58:32 - i don't have to go to a folder to open
58:34 - it up to go to another folder to go into
58:37 - my messages
58:38 - to then click on my messages and then
58:39 - read it nope i just go into my home
58:42 - screen
58:42 - i click on messages and i can see my
58:44 - messages it's literally like
58:45 - three clicks so you're gonna have to
58:48 - think about you know
58:50 - how users interact with your app or
58:52 - website and the way that you do that is
58:54 - by empathizing
58:55 - so you think about the whole user
58:57 - interactive journey right
58:59 - and after that what you do is you
59:01 - actually define
59:02 - define it so it's like okay so
59:05 - i want to make this the most efficient
59:07 - way for you to use this app what am i
59:09 - going to do i'm going to be empathetical
59:11 - and how my users are are using my app
59:14 - now let's define what that means so now
59:16 - what that means is that
59:18 - for you to go into messages you're not
59:19 - gonna have to do five clicks you're
59:20 - gonna have to do three clicks because
59:22 - i'm gonna put the app in the home store
59:24 - that is one of the ways that you can
59:26 - define things then after that
59:29 - you're defining them and then after that
59:31 - you become
59:32 - you start playing with ideas right so
59:34 - it's like okay so i'm
59:36 - putting my apps in the actual home
59:38 - screen so what does that mean
59:39 - you know i'm actually not gonna make it
59:41 - so that they have it very hard
59:43 - and we're almost at 650 likes guys let's
59:46 - go
59:47 - 646 likes that is amazing
59:50 - thank you guys so so much i appreciate
59:53 - this
59:53 - and we're going to be diving deeper into
59:55 - this stay tuned so you guys can learn
59:56 - color theory because i feel like that is
59:58 - going to connect
59:59 - all the knowledge of all of these design
60:01 - tools that i'm talking about
60:03 - so after you define how users are going
60:06 - to want to use your app
60:07 - then you're going to want to have ideas
60:08 - of it so yes i can put my
60:11 - icons in the home screen yes i can just
60:13 - maybe
60:14 - show not that many menus so that people
60:16 - can access my app
60:18 - so ideas is once you have that defined
60:20 - you can start
60:22 - you know prototyping ideas for that and
60:23 - then the cool thing
60:25 - is after the ideas boom you prototype
60:28 - like i just said
60:29 - so prototyping is cool because you know
60:31 - there it
60:32 - it really shows you ways that you can
60:34 - build the app before building the app
60:36 - so let me actually take a drink of this
60:38 - and then after that i'll just answer a
60:40 - little bit of you guys comments because
60:42 - i see that you guys are dropping a lot a
60:43 - lot of love let's go
60:49 - yup so some people are saying zagar
60:52 - thiagi
60:54 - he says they don't teach these things in
60:56 - college you have to learn on your own
60:58 - that is very very true man they don't
61:00 - even teach it in companies sometimes man
61:03 - you learning out of experience other
61:06 - people not using your apps
61:07 - other people using your apps that's how
61:09 - you're kind of going to learn all of
61:10 - these things
61:11 - so going into prototyping man
61:13 - prototyping is awesome just because ah
61:15 - man
61:16 - i personally love prototyping because
61:18 - before building the actual app you can
61:20 - just design it you can just design the
61:22 - whole
61:22 - user experience of the app what does
61:25 - that mean
61:26 - you pretty much add you know how you're
61:28 - gonna use
61:29 - like how many clicks it's gonna take you
61:30 - to do any specific function
61:33 - where you know your picture is showing
61:35 - and whoa we just got another donation by
61:38 - deepak
61:38 - let's go deepak thank you so much man
61:40 - yesterday you helped us
61:42 - pass the 200 mark man i really really
61:44 - appreciate that
61:45 - and he's donating 150 indian rupees so
61:50 - love it man he's saying nice content
61:51 - informative love it thank you so much
61:54 - deepak
61:55 - so prototyping i'm going to talk about a
61:56 - few tools is pretty much
61:58 - you brainstorming the design that you're
62:00 - going to do for that and then after that
62:01 - obviously like
62:02 - any good software developer will tell
62:04 - you after the code
62:06 - after the build you're going to want to
62:07 - have to test
62:09 - obviously test even if you know you're a
62:12 - college student i feel like
62:13 - you know testing your code is one of the
62:16 - most important things that you can do i
62:18 - was even telling sonny that yesterday
62:19 - i'm like bro
62:20 - one of the the things that i like the
62:21 - most about your development is that you
62:23 - implement
62:24 - right off the bat what the first thing
62:26 - you do is test and
62:28 - i see that that saves you so much time
62:30 - and you have to implement that into your
62:32 - regimen into your coding resume
62:34 - so moving forward into this one of the
62:36 - biggest
62:37 - biggest biggest things that i can
62:39 - actually recommend you guys to do
62:41 - is check out figma.com if you guys
62:44 - are you know designing any web app any
62:48 - application the cool thing about figma
62:51 - is that one of like first of all it
62:54 - looks professional
62:55 - af like holy it looks amazing
62:58 - the cool thing about it is that it has
63:00 - drag and drop functionalities
63:02 - to it so that's beautiful all in its own
63:06 - so look right here you can it literally
63:08 - tells you
63:09 - the dimension of pixels between the
63:11 - x-axis and the y-axis so if you guys are
63:14 - a little bit nerdy in that
63:15 - you know you can pretty much show the
63:17 - template that you're building stuff
63:19 - in and it's going to tell you the
63:20 - specific sizes of specific windows
63:22 - the cool thing about thing man that i
63:23 - love the most
63:25 - the most that that's just actually why i
63:28 - wanted to share with you guys
63:29 - is the fact that let me actually write
63:31 - it here people are saying ligma
63:33 - thick my bruh figma so
63:36 - let's write that in the comments below
63:38 - you guys are seeing that come up so
63:39 - figma is awesome because if you do drag
63:41 - and drop drop functionalities
63:43 - on your app it's going to show you the
63:46 - css code it's going to show you the html
63:48 - code
63:49 - that you're going to want to use for
63:50 - your build so
63:52 - you know after building them as drag and
63:55 - drop functionalities
63:56 - you can actually get the css code in
63:58 - that html code like i said
64:00 - in even a little bit of that javascript
64:02 - code depending on what specific
64:03 - animation or
64:04 - movement you do on that app so all those
64:07 - things are part of figma
64:09 - i think it's a great great way to
64:12 - implement
64:12 - new things into ui and ux figma.com guys
64:16 - check it out so another cool thing right
64:18 - here that i see
64:20 - is pc.js website so
64:23 - on my other video the top seven
64:25 - javascript libraries we talked about
64:27 - pixie js and pxjs is an awesome library
64:30 - for javascript right now
64:32 - the cool thing about it is that huge
64:34 - companies such as
64:35 - disney are using it literally disney
64:38 - disney is one of the biggest
64:39 - entertainment companies in the world
64:41 - and if they're using pixie js then you
64:44 - have no reason why not
64:45 - to use pixie js if you're doing anything
64:47 - animation like the cool thing about pcjs
64:50 - is that it uses 3d graphics
64:51 - and also two 2d graphics to take it to
64:54 - the next level
64:55 - there's also cool libraries like 3d 3
64:57 - 3js that actually you know brings three
65:00 - 3d specific designs to the next level
65:02 - but going into this
65:04 - these were designed by goodpoint digital
65:07 - company
65:08 - and it's awesome they're using
65:09 - javascript like i said
65:11 - so one of the biggest biggest things
65:13 - that i wanted to share with you about
65:15 - this specific you know pc.js website is
65:17 - the fact that for you to learn the most
65:20 - guys it's really not about the skill set
65:23 - that you have
65:24 - it's really not about you know how
65:26 - you're gonna
65:27 - implement all of this it's not about you
65:29 - know
65:30 - where you wanna go in your career it's
65:32 - not about anything of that guys
65:35 - at the end of the day results results
65:38 - dictate everything results dictate
65:40 - design results
65:42 - dictate the way that you're gonna you
65:44 - know make a website because if you're
65:46 - not selling anything with really nice
65:48 - design then you're not going to want to
65:49 - use that design if you have an ecommerce
65:51 - website
65:52 - so my recommendation for you guys is
65:55 - if you're starting off with becoming a
65:57 - front-end developer a ui
65:58 - developer a ux developer what you're
66:00 - going to want to do is copy
66:02 - top designers you don't want to start
66:04 - from scratch you don't want to think
66:06 - like oh yeah this looks good
66:08 - but then have no reference experience of
66:09 - why it looks good
66:11 - you're going to want to copy top
66:13 - designers in the world
66:14 - right now that are showing their things
66:16 - such as sony xperia
66:18 - or literally this day or literally all
66:20 - of these huge companies that are using
66:22 - these technologies
66:23 - and i always say this it's not about
66:26 - how good you are but it's about what
66:29 - type of design
66:30 - or style you have because your style is
66:32 - gonna dictate the design
66:34 - so if you have a very outdated style
66:36 - it's gonna dictate your design if you
66:38 - have a modern style it's gonna dictate
66:39 - your design
66:40 - if you have a very interactive modern
66:42 - minimalistic style it's
66:44 - gonna dictate your design learn from the
66:47 - top
66:48 - designers in the world right now so
66:51 - we're gonna go into this a lot of the
66:52 - things that people
66:53 - you know wanna break things into is
66:55 - gonna be the layout which is pretty much
66:57 - the ui placement
66:58 - spacing the padding the grids of the
67:01 - specific build
67:02 - the navigation which pretty much is the
67:05 - placement and the size of the navigation
67:07 - bar whether that's on the top
67:08 - and the bottom in the middle that
67:10 - typography is super
67:12 - duper important in terms of branding in
67:14 - terms of design all this because it
67:15 - gives the feel
67:16 - of the whole brand the whole website
67:18 - that you want to do
67:19 - so font sizes the line height and then
67:22 - sarah for sans
67:23 - serif which is pretty much very basic
67:27 - typography is based on helvetica most of
67:29 - the
67:30 - the the fonts are really based on
67:32 - helvetica if you
67:33 - if you guys want to research that that's
67:35 - dope it was mind-blowing to me
67:37 - so icons are dope we go over a huge
67:39 - libraries that people love
67:41 - right now which are pretty much you know
67:43 - material ui bootstrap and all of these
67:45 - because you know you're going to want to
67:47 - save time
67:48 - and people have already gathered those
67:50 - resources for you so use
67:52 - icons that are very in right now very
67:54 - very modern
67:55 - very minimalistic add them to your own
67:58 - design
67:58 - and another thing is going to be
67:59 - background as you can see you can see
68:02 - gradient or photo used so
68:03 - like i mentioned before gradient is
68:05 - super in right now in design
68:06 - so make sure to not only use plain
68:08 - colors use gradients because they look
68:10 - so so well put together and also if
68:12 - you're using a background you might want
68:14 - to think about adding a
68:15 - big photo in there because it just adds
68:18 - so much more of that human-like
68:20 - you know human-like specific you know
68:24 - functionality to it as well as
68:26 - also it adds a lot of a little bit of
68:28 - more of
68:29 - of character to it i feel it's kind of
68:31 - crazy
68:32 - i love it guys so we are at 700
68:35 - sorry 672 likes whoa that's insane man
68:39 - if we reach 700 i would pretty much piss
68:42 - my pants that's insane
68:44 - i never expected this so i'm just you
68:46 - know getting my coffee right now i'm
68:48 - like yo
68:48 - just you know researching a bit trying
68:50 - to help you guys out with everything
68:52 - it's insane thank you guys so much for
68:54 - getting a lot of value from this
68:56 - i don't want you guys to just listen to
68:58 - all of this i want you guys to actually
69:00 - implement it because at the end of the
69:01 - day
69:01 - so many developers so many people have
69:03 - gotten jobs off of our videos off of
69:06 - actually implementing these
69:08 - practicalities that we talk about every
69:09 - single day
69:10 - so make sure you do that and let's not
69:12 - just stay stagnant
69:14 - so now i want to touch on color theory
69:16 - and let me just take a sip of this i'll
69:18 - dive into that deeply because i'm super
69:20 - passionate about color theory and if you
69:22 - guys learn
69:22 - this specifically then you're going to
69:24 - be able to learn so many other things
69:26 - whether that's with design ux ui or fun
69:30 - and development
69:30 - so let's dive right into it after the
69:33 - sip of coffee
69:37 - so what's cool about color theory guys
69:40 - is some people think most of the people
69:43 - that i talk
69:44 - to whether they're front-end developers
69:47 - whether they're web developers or web
69:49 - designers
69:51 - most people don't know the psychology of
69:54 - color
69:54 - so we're humans right and humans
69:58 - have like you cannot ignore the
70:00 - psychological aspects
70:02 - of humans ever because whether that's
70:05 - with code
70:06 - you know sometimes in code it's really
70:08 - hard for you to be
70:09 - you know engaging the code whether
70:11 - that's because you're feeling bored
70:13 - whether that's because you don't have
70:14 - any community or like-minded individuals
70:16 - behind you
70:17 - everything has to do with how you
70:19 - process everything psychologically and
70:21 - color
70:22 - is a thing that you do process
70:24 - psychologically just like anything else
70:27 - and let's say let's let's actually give
70:29 - examples to this right
70:31 - so most of the big companies that you
70:33 - see right now
70:35 - in the world are actually think about
70:37 - their logo so facebook logo what color
70:39 - is it
70:39 - it's blue right think about twitter logo
70:42 - what color is it it's blue right
70:44 - think about i don't know what other
70:46 - color what other logo is blue
70:48 - so many colors like so many logos are
70:50 - blue it's insane
70:51 - but the cool thing about blue logos is
70:54 - the fact that
70:56 - blue is pretty much a synonymous
70:58 - psychological trigger
71:00 - for confidence for secure most
71:03 - importantly
71:04 - trust so i think in my opinion trust is
71:06 - the most important
71:07 - um aspect of the blue color loyo
71:11 - cleanliness progress powerful calm
71:14 - masculine success responsible
71:17 - authoritative
71:18 - blue is an example of all of this
71:22 - and it's literally like guys like
71:25 - literally it's
71:26 - not random facebook didn't want to be
71:28 - blue
71:29 - because it's random nope these guys know
71:31 - color psychology
71:33 - so whenever you're doing web development
71:35 - web design fun and design
71:37 - think about the psychology of the colors
71:39 - that's going to take you to the next
71:41 - level
71:41 - how people respond to your specific apps
71:44 - another one would be
71:45 - red so red is synonymous for excitement
71:49 - for youthful active leader passion
71:52 - powerful
71:53 - radical excited bold energy confident
71:55 - hot energy
71:56 - youthful pioneering and urgency the most
71:59 - important one right here in my opinion
72:00 - would be
72:01 - urgency so all of these pretty much are
72:04 - synonymous for urgency so everything
72:06 - that is read
72:06 - just like if you think about in the real
72:08 - world red means blood pretty much if you
72:10 - see
72:11 - blood it's like holy that's urgent
72:13 - we have to take care of that right
72:14 - now let's go you know we're pretty much
72:17 - we're pretty much
72:18 - animals you know we're pretty much part
72:19 - of nature
72:21 - and we have triggers that you know
72:24 - did develop because of color so all of
72:26 - these are part of that purple
72:28 - has to do with elegance has to do with
72:29 - royalty it has to do with
72:31 - you know romantic mystical experience
72:33 - all of that that is why a lot of royal
72:36 - type of colors are gonna be purple you
72:38 - know if kings used to use purple
72:40 - it's a very hard color to get and at the
72:42 - same time it just gives
72:44 - so much more functionality to whatever
72:47 - you're building and devin gray says
72:49 - facebook twitter bluehost jira bitbucket
72:52 - basically
72:53 - all of atlassan so all of these
72:55 - companies do
72:56 - use blue you know that's what i'm trying
72:58 - to say and
72:59 - zoom uses uses blue true color
73:02 - uses blue skype uses blue google dual
73:06 - uses blue
73:07 - devon gray is saying microsoft uses blue
73:11 - guys it's no it's really no
73:14 - um coincidence these guys know these
73:17 - things so color theory if you want to
73:18 - take your next level
73:20 - if you want to go to the next level in
73:21 - design specifically so
73:23 - like i said guys you know the psychology
73:25 - aspects of this is going to be insane
73:27 - and one of the biggest and hardest part
73:29 - about programming is being able to
73:31 - program alone
73:32 - to build things alone and not with the
73:34 - team which is very much
73:36 - retracted from real reality in most of
73:38 - programming
73:39 - you're going to have to work with a team
73:41 - and in my opinion if you really want to
73:42 - up your skills want to be part of a huge
73:45 - huge huge community of 1500
73:48 - active developers on the daily make sure
73:51 - to check out the link in the description
73:52 - below guys
73:53 - we have a free one hour training that
73:55 - teaches you guys how to become a
73:57 - profitable javascript developer learn
73:59 - all the skills from basic javascript to
74:02 - full stack javascript to even react
74:04 - all of these tools that pretty much you
74:06 - need to get a job
74:08 - and i'm not saying this out of my ass so
74:10 - many people have gotten jobs out of this
74:12 - specific training this specific
74:14 - program and guys you know we're pretty
74:16 - much
74:17 - tribal individuals let's go into
74:20 - creating communities creating people you
74:22 - know
74:22 - creating circles where people are
74:24 - engaged and we can learn from them and
74:26 - work together
74:27 - so let's go back to all of this make
74:28 - sure to check out that link in the
74:30 - description below go to our free
74:31 - one-hour training to become a
74:33 - javascript developer going back into
74:35 - brand color psychology
74:37 - like i said before blue is trust
74:39 - dependable green is more of a peaceful
74:42 - type of healthy vibe the orange is
74:44 - optimistic
74:45 - yet it's also kind of like warning like
74:47 - it grabs your attention
74:49 - and then you know salmon type of color
74:51 - is more of a friendly
74:53 - type of uh a little bit feminine type of
74:55 - color but also
74:56 - you know feminine but neutral and then
75:00 - pink slash red is kind of more exciting
75:02 - it's kind of more
75:04 - grabs your attention more like urgent
75:06 - type of thing purple is more like
75:08 - creative
75:08 - kind of like royal kind of like you know
75:10 - visualization type of thing
75:12 - and gray which is a very very neutral is
75:14 - a
75:15 - very calm color so all of these things
75:17 - are part of the color
75:19 - psychology chart and you should pay
75:21 - attention to it
75:22 - also color theory a lot of people don't
75:23 - talk about this specifically
75:26 - but there's primary there's secondary
75:28 - and there's tertiary colors
75:30 - if you're designing anything guys you
75:32 - guys have to pay attention to this
75:34 - specifically so let me see what's going
75:36 - on in the comments
75:37 - right now guys we've been live for one
75:40 - hour and 15 minutes which is
75:42 - pretty freaking awesome i love to share
75:43 - this knowledge with you guys
75:45 - some people are saying can you tell me
75:47 - how to use 3js officially to make movie
75:49 - like website intros
75:50 - man i'll show you an example right now
75:53 - josh
75:54 - is actually saying that and bro i
75:58 - actually didn't want to go through
75:59 - websites that use 3js because they're so
76:02 - dope
76:03 - they're so in like holy crap these guys
76:06 - make it an experience 3js is not only
76:08 - design it's also an experience and in my
76:11 - opinion that's where design is going to
76:12 - go in the future
76:14 - so that's a pretty cool comment right
76:15 - there some people
76:17 - like cigar are saying although i have
76:19 - been working on it since
76:21 - two years but still i feel you can never
76:23 - learn the whole thing
76:24 - so logically i'm still learning but
76:26 - technically it took me one and a half
76:28 - month to start working on it
76:30 - so cigar what are you talking about
76:31 - specifically bro let us know
76:34 - are you talking about web development
76:35 - web design what specifically
76:38 - so that's pretty cool so
76:41 - hemant says can someone review this i'm
76:43 - purchasing this and we'll work on that i
76:45 - don't want to be a developer but instead
76:47 - my view is work
76:48 - as an entrepreneur brother and we're
76:50 - talking about profit with javascript go
76:51 - into the description below check out
76:52 - that training
76:53 - maybe buy the course if you're
76:55 - interested and you see any benefit in
76:56 - joining to that because at the end of
76:58 - the day
76:58 - we base a lot of our designs into you
77:01 - know our builds we build a lot of
77:03 - a lot of our projects with these
77:05 - specific designs just because we know
77:07 - it is what is in right now in the
77:09 - industry because that's
77:11 - the things that are actually going to
77:12 - get you results so you want to base your
77:14 - builds out of results you just don't
77:16 - want
77:17 - your code to look and be functional
77:20 - you want it to be actually beautiful for
77:22 - people to use you want to give
77:24 - users a real experience that's why
77:27 - user experience in user interface
77:30 - people are paid so well even
77:33 - you know above the six figure mark
77:35 - because
77:37 - you would never use facebook if if if
77:39 - the
77:40 - you know what i mean like you would
77:41 - never use facebook or instagram if the
77:44 - actual design of it
77:45 - was sucky you would never use it the
77:48 - functionalities are great
77:49 - but the way that it kills it is that it
77:52 - takes a lot of psychological remarks
77:54 - and references into its design and
77:57 - that's what takes it to the next level
77:59 - that's what makes it addictive for
78:00 - people to start using
78:02 - they think about all of these things
78:03 - guys it's not just random
78:06 - so going into the color wheel like i was
78:08 - talking about
78:09 - so all of these things let me bust out
78:11 - my little presentation tool
78:13 - so primary is gonna be it's funny
78:15 - because people don't know this a lot of
78:16 - people don't know this
78:17 - there's only three primary colors all of
78:21 - the colors
78:22 - in the world are based out of these
78:24 - three colors
78:25 - i'm not you there's three
78:27 - colors okay
78:28 - there's five colors let's say that three
78:30 - primary colors which is
78:32 - red blue and yellow and you can do
78:36 - myriad thousands millions in
78:38 - combinations of these three
78:40 - colors but the two other colors i want
78:42 - to hit on right now
78:43 - is going to be black and white so the
78:46 - primary colors
78:47 - in my opinion are going to be red blue
78:50 - yellow
78:51 - black and white because if you do a
78:54 - mixture of black and white then you get
78:55 - gray
78:56 - but those are the main colors in the
78:57 - world and we're at 697
79:00 - lines baby let's go you know design is a
79:03 - beautiful things guys
79:05 - it's it's it's if you do end up you know
79:07 - putting this into your work into your
79:09 - builds
79:10 - it's gonna take your bills to the next
79:12 - level we're about to reach the 700 like
79:14 - mark so make sure to like that video
79:16 - smash that like button
79:18 - share with other people like you other
79:21 - of your design friends whether that's a
79:23 - maybe a web designer a web developer
79:25 - maybe a
79:27 - graphic designer maybe a front-end
79:28 - developer all of these guys can take so
79:30 - much
79:31 - value off of this and if you guys can
79:33 - bounce ideas off of each other then
79:34 - that's gonna take you to the next level
79:36 - and we just crossed the 700 like mark
79:38 - guys let's freaking go
79:41 - love it we're at seven dollars and
79:43 - seventy cents in chat revenue
79:45 - i cannot be more grateful with you guys
79:47 - than right now in this moment
79:48 - but going back into color theory man
79:51 - what's cool about color theory i'll
79:52 - teach you guys a little bit about it i
79:53 - mean i can't go so much
79:55 - so deep into it because it's going to
79:56 - take it can literally take me hours to
79:58 - explain to you guys
79:59 - and i can show you you know different
80:00 - types of people that used to like
80:03 - picasso
80:03 - like jackson pollock and and huge great
80:07 - painters and designers in the world that
80:09 - stood the time of
80:11 - the test of time are using color theory
80:14 - so
80:14 - let's say okay let's say i'm i'm
80:18 - right now you know mixing red
80:21 - with yellow what color would that give
80:23 - me so i'm mixing two
80:24 - primary colors so if i mix a primary
80:27 - with the primary i'm gonna get a
80:29 - secondary color which would be orange
80:32 - guys
80:33 - if you mix two primary colors then
80:35 - you're gonna get a secondary color
80:37 - right and that's that's dope a lot of
80:39 - people don't know that but if you
80:40 - join like let's say i'm mixing yellow
80:42 - which is a primary and blue which is a
80:44 - primary
80:44 - i'm gonna get green
80:48 - guys that's what's cool about it so two
80:50 - primary colors
80:51 - make a secondary color and the way that
80:54 - you make tertiary colors
80:56 - is for example i'm gonna be i'm gonna be
80:59 - doing
80:59 - a primary with the secondary right so if
81:02 - you do a primary with a secondary
81:04 - let's say red i'm doing red i'm mixing
81:07 - red with violet then i'm going to get
81:09 - a tertiary color which is red violet
81:12 - so secondary colors are made by mixing
81:16 - two primary colors the three primary
81:19 - colors
81:20 - literally right now in the world are
81:21 - just red blue and yellow
81:23 - all colors are based out of those colors
81:25 - so you mix
81:26 - red with yellow which both of them are
81:28 - primary colors
81:29 - then you're going to get orange which is
81:31 - the secondary color but let's say
81:33 - you want to mix a primary color which is
81:35 - red
81:36 - and a secondary color which is orange so
81:38 - you're going to get
81:39 - you know primary mixed with secondary
81:42 - color is gonna give you a tertiary
81:44 - color and i don't remember specifically
81:48 - but i learned this in one of my art
81:49 - classes
81:50 - the fact that if you mix i think more
81:52 - than four colors or more than three
81:54 - colors
81:54 - all in one it's always gonna give you
81:56 - brown that was mind-blowing to me i was
81:58 - like what
81:59 - the it like it's always gonna give
82:01 - you brown and i tested it and it is true
82:03 - if you mix more then i think that's why
82:06 - there's not more than
82:08 - the tertiary tier of colors because if
82:10 - you mix more than this
82:11 - you're just going to get brown
82:12 - everything turns to brown everything
82:14 - turns to
82:15 - you know at the end of the day so this
82:17 - is kind of how this works
82:19 - and let me just tell you guys if you
82:20 - guys are doing design you guys are one
82:22 - and gonna
82:23 - you're gonna want to use the
82:25 - complementary colors so i don't think it
82:27 - has it on this chart let me see if i
82:29 - have it in the other chart
82:31 - no i don't have it but right now like
82:33 - let's say for example
82:34 - yellow so the color wheel how it works
82:37 - is that normally
82:38 - colors are based and put here because
82:41 - in the opposite part of it then you can
82:43 - see the freaking opposite
82:45 - so for example yellow the opposite of
82:48 - yellow is going to be violet or
82:50 - purple that's why these are put together
82:52 - the opposite of blue
82:53 - is going to be orange that's why these
82:55 - are particular the opposite of
82:57 - red is going to be green that's where
82:59 - these are put together same with here so
83:01 - yellow green the opposite of this is
83:02 - going to be red violet so
83:04 - if you guys are doing designs if you
83:05 - guys are looking at color palettes
83:07 - always have color theory in mind take
83:10 - some time to learn about it because
83:11 - that's what's gonna dictate your design
83:13 - that's what gonna that's what's gonna
83:14 - make it look
83:15 - and go to the next level now when you
83:17 - guys see colors in design
83:18 - you guys are going to be able to
83:19 - actually be like oh like these guys
83:22 - are using
83:22 - you know these are called complementary
83:25 - colors so the opposite colors are
83:27 - are called complementary like oh no
83:29 - wonder easter is made of yellow
83:31 - and purple no wonder christmas
83:34 - is made out of red and green you know no
83:37 - wonder
83:38 - everybody that is going crazy on actual
83:41 - color grading and just you know
83:44 - what's it called yeah literally color
83:45 - grading in movies is
83:47 - blue and orange everybody's going crazy
83:50 - with blue and orange which is teal and
83:51 - orange pretty much
83:53 - so color theory is super duper important
83:55 - if you don't know anything about it
83:58 - man this just adds so much context in
84:00 - your life so really learn about it and
84:02 - two of the things that i want to
84:04 - actually mention here is now that i went
84:06 - over
84:06 - all of this and hopefully you guys could
84:08 - take a lot of benefit a lot of
84:09 - actual you know value from all of this
84:12 - is i want to drop
84:13 - a little bit of resources for you guys
84:15 - for you guys to actually use
84:16 - one of the biggest resources that i've
84:18 - been able to use myself is going to be
84:20 - dribble.com
84:21 - and that's dribble with three b's the
84:23 - cool thing about this
84:24 - is that dribble actually shows you you
84:27 - know
84:28 - huge examples of people that have you
84:31 - use
84:31 - the designs that are really right now
84:33 - hip really right now you know
84:35 - busting the industry people are using
84:36 - them so much and you can base yourself
84:39 - get inspiration
84:40 - out of all of these so this is an
84:42 - example of an illustration this is an
84:43 - example
84:44 - of illustration in an app this is an
84:46 - example of
84:47 - you know making it a little bit more
84:49 - humanistic as well as illustration
84:51 - this is also like we talked about this
84:54 - looks like a freaking
84:56 - like a card that would look like
84:57 - neomorphism and
84:59 - there's not a there's not that much
85:01 - contrast so all of these things are put
85:03 - together so that you can kind of pretty
85:05 - much you know have direction on how to
85:07 - move through that app
85:08 - so dribble is gonna be a great great
85:11 - resource for you to
85:12 - use this specifically now going back to
85:15 - the presentation guys
85:16 - um dribble is awesome three b's don't
85:19 - forget that i was writing dribble with
85:20 - two b's damn that's
85:21 - i was like what the like it was not
85:23 - working then somebody in the comments
85:25 - below
85:25 - dropped like hey dude it's with three
85:27 - b's and i'm like oh man thank you so
85:28 - much
85:29 - but people get confused with that so
85:31 - another one of the biggest
85:32 - design websites right now that you can
85:34 - take as a resource is going to be
85:37 - elements.envato.com or envato.com you
85:39 - know
85:40 - this website is dope not only because it
85:43 - shows you just like dribble
85:45 - it it gives you great examples of what
85:47 - is
85:48 - very much in in the industry right now
85:50 - so it gives you an example of a social
85:52 - media booster kits
85:53 - of you know a website of a farmer like
85:55 - how you can show
85:57 - your freaking produce like just
85:59 - specifically how to
86:01 - you know move around the city which is a
86:03 - specific you know example of color
86:05 - how you can brand your own website as
86:08 - logo
86:09 - all of these things envato is a great
86:11 - great resource that i've known for
86:12 - years and years to come but at the same
86:15 - time man
86:16 - envato is really cool not only because
86:18 - it's it's very important for you but
86:20 - you're
86:20 - if you're an actual designer but also
86:22 - it's a great
86:23 - way to have a designer community in your
86:26 - life
86:27 - so you can post your designer profile in
86:30 - envato
86:30 - and actually comment on other people's
86:32 - builds on their posts
86:35 - giving props for him all that and
86:36 - ultimately you know teach him that like
86:38 - yo
86:39 - this is maybe not this may not be the
86:41 - best design
86:42 - your colors here was kind of off bro
86:44 - those were not complementary colors
86:46 - use three tertiary colors and it kind of
86:49 - looks brown to me so it doesn't look
86:50 - that good you know
86:51 - so all of those things are going to be
86:53 - able to you know you're going to be able
86:55 - to use them at the end of this
86:56 - presentation so
86:57 - like i said guys don't just take the
86:58 - theory of it make it practical put it in
87:01 - your builds put it in your apps put it
87:02 - in your websites
87:03 - that's what's going to take you to the
87:04 - next level that's what's going to take
87:06 - you to actually get a job with these
87:08 - things so
87:09 - like i said before ui ux designers get
87:11 - paid very very well we're going to check
87:13 - out
87:13 - the actual how much they get paid here
87:15 - in the us at the end of this
87:17 - another great example of where you can
87:20 - actually get
87:21 - um you know resources for web
87:24 - development
87:25 - app development web web app development
87:27 - is going to be pinterest
87:29 - some people think that pinterest is just
87:30 - for girls some people think that
87:32 - pinterest is just to
87:33 - pretty much decorate your house and all
87:35 - of this but no brother
87:37 - pinterest is awesome for recipes no i'm
87:39 - kidding but pinterest is awesome because
87:41 - it really does show you different
87:43 - examples of design
87:44 - the thing that i like about intro
87:46 - pinterest is that
87:47 - for example one of the biggest things in
87:50 - my opinion is that it shows you
87:52 - very modern design whether that's app
87:54 - design web design or
87:56 - just you know design in general whether
87:58 - that's typography or just color
88:00 - and everything in between all of that
88:03 - and the cool thing about
88:04 - pinterest is the fact that you can
88:06 - pretty much just type in app design or
88:08 - you can type in web design or you can
88:10 - type in
88:10 - graphic design anything of that sort and
88:13 - you're gonna see
88:15 - how modern they are most of these
88:17 - designs most of the minimalist style of
88:19 - design comes from eastern europe
88:22 - you know that's where helvetica came to
88:24 - helvetica is the most
88:25 - minimalist and modern um font that most
88:29 - fonts are based out of there's actually
88:31 - a cool
88:32 - film that you can check out if you check
88:33 - out on youtube right now history of
88:35 - helvetica you're going to see this film
88:37 - i don't remember what it's called i
88:38 - believe it's just called helvetica
88:39 - and it shows you how all of the fonts in
88:42 - the world
88:43 - right now the modern fonts are built out
88:45 - of helvetica
88:46 - and yep it was built and made in the i
88:49 - think 1960s
88:51 - in eastern europe so a lot of that
88:53 - minimalist design that you guys see
88:55 - whether that's in furniture like ikea or
88:57 - design like in the web development
88:58 - designs that we're seeing now or the fun
89:00 - designs that we're seeing now
89:01 - are based out of eastern europe and a
89:03 - lot of eastern european design
89:05 - is made and shown in pinterest and
89:07 - that's something that i freaking love
89:09 - that's one of the
89:10 - best you know resources that i can share
89:12 - with you guys and so
89:14 - that pretty much brings us to a wrap and
89:17 - here i you know i'm showing a gift right
89:19 - now people are saying
89:20 - uh this is amazing wow when the upload
89:24 - react.js scratch course bro people are
89:26 - asking about the reaction is course from
89:28 - scratch
89:29 - guys it's going to come in the next week
89:31 - but i do want to share with you guys
89:32 - that all of these skills
89:34 - all of these things that you can
89:35 - practically put into your portfolio into
89:37 - your projects
89:38 - are gonna make it so much more beautiful
89:41 - they're gonna make it so much more
89:44 - powerful people are gonna use it
89:45 - they're gonna stick with it they're
89:47 - actually gonna you know
89:49 - you're actually gonna see results from
89:50 - it so a lot of people make apps that are
89:52 - just
89:53 - functional but at the same time they
89:54 - don't look good and if you have this
89:56 - ability to make it interactive to make
89:58 - it
89:59 - so that people get addicted to your ad
90:02 - man
90:02 - i cannot share with you how many results
90:04 - you're gonna get in that
90:05 - but let's touch a little bit about what
90:07 - people are dropping in the comments
90:09 - right now the castile says i know some
90:12 - logo with yellow and black it looks
90:14 - awesome so yellow and black is actually
90:16 - a great great combination brother
90:18 - i know dan walker and instagram drops
90:21 - very fire content so make sure to like
90:23 - dan walker too
90:24 - you know this guy is most of his design
90:27 - does
90:27 - go around yellow and black it's a great
90:30 - great um
90:31 - you know a design pattern it doesn't all
90:34 - have to follow the color wheel but the
90:36 - color wheel is going to show you
90:37 - exactly you know what colors you can
90:39 - blend together and what colors look good
90:41 - too
90:41 - so yellow and purple looks awesome but
90:43 - yellow and black looks amazing because
90:45 - of
90:46 - the the contrast of that design at the
90:48 - same time i know for a fact that if
90:50 - you're using yellow and you're using
90:52 - white font it's not going to look good
90:54 - it's actually kind of like a principle
90:56 - in design that you're not supposed to
90:57 - use yellow
90:58 - font on white background or white
91:01 - background in yellow font
91:02 - because it's very hard for the eye to
91:04 - see so all of these things are just like
91:06 - you know little details that people
91:08 - sometimes don't know
91:10 - so abdullah says what's up abdullah love
91:13 - it man i saw that you got an affiliate
91:14 - sale some days ago
91:16 - congrats to you brother appreciate that
91:18 - and he says ui ux holds a specific place
91:20 - in the popularity of the website
91:22 - let's say and of course you would like
91:23 - to pick colors which are appealing to
91:25 - the users or which are lighter on the
91:27 - eye
91:28 - that is true my man a lot of new you
91:30 - know modern websites are using
91:32 - colors that are very very easy for the
91:35 - eyes so they use
91:36 - purple they use gray they use white not
91:38 - so much
91:39 - black maybe black to pop up the colors
91:42 - that you're using
91:43 - but subtle colors that don't show that
91:45 - much contrast and that's going back
91:47 - into the actual neomorphistic design
91:49 - that i was talking about you guys
91:51 - so some people are saying this is dope
91:54 - the next level
91:55 - level the next level of knowledge garuf
91:58 - says
91:59 - is human computer interaction course is
92:01 - important to boost our ux portfolio
92:03 - human computer interaction course so
92:06 - i think human computer interaction is
92:09 - what a lot of colleges are using
92:11 - or to call you know the fact that design
92:14 - has a lot to do with the human
92:16 - psychology and it's dope and i mean i
92:20 - don't know much about it but
92:21 - i know for a fact that if you base your
92:23 - design on human psychology how people
92:25 - are gonna interact with your app
92:26 - it's just gonna it's just gonna make it
92:28 - that much more appealing that much more
92:30 - addictive
92:31 - that much more easy to use so all of
92:34 - those things are
92:34 - amazing and ricardo bermudez says
92:37 - frankie saludos is the colombia
92:39 - beautiful man
92:40 - mucho gusto my friend ricardo como estas
92:43 - amigo
92:43 - aqui nomas compartendo poco del disenos
92:48 - super important super important to learn
92:50 - design so
92:51 - guys i think that is going to be a wrap
92:54 - for you guys
92:55 - and i mean hopefully you guys can get a
92:57 - lot of content
92:59 - a lot of value from this and something
93:01 - resha
93:02 - says i'm colorblind and good in front
93:05 - end but always gets confused in color
93:07 - that's funny man
93:08 - like become being actually colorblind
93:11 - and being a ux designer
93:13 - that's awesome one of my cousins he's
93:15 - actually uh
93:16 - he right now he's a full stack
93:18 - javascript developer he's amazing in
93:20 - front
93:21 - and the guy is colorblind bro like he's
93:23 - an amazing artist and at the same time
93:24 - he's color blind
93:26 - so i don't think that's gonna hold you
93:27 - back from your career from actually
93:29 - applying all of these tools
93:31 - i really really appreciate this so
93:34 - yep that's a wrap guys thank you so much

94:57 - knowledge because i'm i'm
94:59 - super duper into design guys i love it
95:02 - so much ever since i got a
95:05 - graphic design course in college my life
95:08 - literally changed
95:09 - and i could just apply it anywhere
95:10 - whenever i would look at billboards
95:12 - whenever i would look at apps whenever i
95:13 - would look at websites
95:15 - i'd be like hmm that design is a little
95:16 - bit off i think it's interesting how
95:18 - they're not using you know
95:20 - just complementary colors or just colors
95:22 - and color wheel and like holy
95:23 - like
95:24 - i can actually dissect designs and
95:27 - styles now just because of this
95:28 - so design is a beautiful thing that you
95:30 - can add to your
95:32 - builds and i think it'll take you to the
95:34 - next level if you follow all of this
95:36 - thank you guys so much love it and love

Cleaned transcript:

today my topic i'm going to be speaking about the top ui ux design trends in 2020 so let's jump right into it all right guys so i'm going to be dissecting pretty much the top tech websites and their uis trying to show exactly what they're doing to make you either buy purchase their product or just stay in their websites because they all have different functionalities to it and it's going to be very very interesting so right off the bat we're going to jump into you know if you guys really do enjoy this content if you guys like the design type of content that we're going to be dropping in the next weeks the next live streams and everything make sure to smash that like button because it's going to help out really a lot a lot a lot with the youtube algorithm and it's going to help it spread to a lot of different people so if you're a web developer if you're a web designer if you work in front end or anything related to that i think you're gonna get massive massive value off of this video so really do like that that freaking thumbs up button and also check out one of our courses and our free one hour training that we show you how to become a javascript developer and we show you these super kickass designs that you can implement in your apps and that will get you first of all paid second about hired third of all just getting to make projects that are really useful for people people really want are going to want to use them so let's jump right into it so off the bat i added a gif right here which is i think super awesome because it shows a little bit of animation right now animation is super super hip super super in instead of design and the thing about this is that you see it as just like maybe things moving around in the screen which is dope it really is but at the same time you see 3d design inside of it and at the same time you see very humanistic like type of movement inside so it's subtle yet it actually applies with a lot of different design trends that are going on right now in this year so right now we're going to be dissecting the 7up website right so 7up website actually was i was recommended to it by one of our viewers which i think was pretty freaking dope and awesome and right now we have about 250 concurrent viewers that's awesome if you guys like this type of content make sure to share it with your friends let everybody learn let everybody you know hop in this train of design and ui ux so let's get it out there for us many people so what i want to do is check out the 7up website which i think is one of the best websites that i've seen in modern times at least in 2020 so let's actually click on it let's go cool so this is the 7up website right off the bat what we can do and see from this and dissect from this actually is the fact that it's super human like so one of the big top trends designs of these websites and really let me sew a video plate so it makes it very accessible for you to go into the videos and all of these things let me actually mute this right here here you go so the cool thing about it is that it makes it super humanlike right so it shows a glass of 7up it shows how images move around all of this it shows a glass you know from the top to the bottom it's kind of like if you were looking at it in a perspective of a human right so it's super super dope in that sense big images like i said are super in right now in 2020 design wise specifically and also if as you can see here there's a human hand literally pouring a seven up over a drink man you never really drink seven up in this type of presentation you drink seven up in a freaking normal type of glass you know these guys are dropping it in a cocktail so they're already hitting up you know people that want to get refreshed by the drink people that want to make cocktails from the drink they're showing how to make cooking recipes for the drink and also literally seeing how to maybe make popsicles off of it and that is dope just because of the fact that you can use it so many different ways so already in this design you can see that it's super humanistic it shows images that you would see in real life you know scenarios scenarios that you would see in real life so all of these are different let me let me show you right now examples it's different examples that you can see pretty much so diving deeper into it you know 7up i think it's a great website to follow if you do want to follow what is very in what is very hip in designs right now only you know even the user experience of it is just amazing man this is so minimalistic this is so hip obviously these guys these guys are trying to hit you know younger markets you know if you're 65 years old you might not think this is actually that cool you know it's it's kind of even retro in a way which it's hitting that classical type of you know brand look that these guys have been going on have had going on in like the last maybe 10 20 years but also making it very hip and also very you know i think i think very interactive at the same time so you know diving a little bit deeper into this that was the seven up website i love it the big images like i said are very very in right now in 2020 it's one of the biggest things that you can do and this is one example that i'm going to share with you guys showing you how actually important it is to add photos in your app and website designs so specifically right here you can let me actually get my pointer here so you can see the eye tracking test so these are heat maps so wherever there is a little bit more red in the in the actual picture you can see where people are clicking the most where people are interacting with the most within that app within that website there's an image here and people are going you know around the text you can see the green that's that means people are clicking on around that type of area but specifically they're clicking on their face so even having an image that pretty much a girl that's pointing down like that just a girl that's pointing down like that you know gives a little bit of direction on how to move inside of that app and that's a big big thing that you're gonna have to implement in your design moving forward in 2020 and beyond it's you know all about the intuitiveness of how you move around a specific app or a website that's why big companies like tesla big companies like even rolex are killing it in their marketing in their web design because of that fact because they make it very easy for the user to use their specific websites man and so this is literally a real live example of that so moving forward there's another example that i want to show you guys there's so many different designs so many different designs depending on the branding that you have the branding is kind of gonna dictate the design of your website so you know depending on what product you sell what type of website you have whether that's maybe an online course website an ecommerce website maybe just an informational website that is gonna dictate what type of design you're gonna have in your website one that i like very much is gonna be the mecca website and the mecca website is cool because going back to this inside is it's an actual festival it's a huge festival in australia and look at it look so it's loading it shows a little 3d cube inside of it that's super hip man and guess what these guys are trying to target really young audiences and what we can see here is that what the man these guys are actually you know look at this like i'm hovering over you see pixel pixelated or or actual you know maybe static type pictures on top of the hovering effects man that is so dope so to me they kind of this kind of reminds me of the 90s style it's kind of like video gamey it's kind of like retro in a way i think it's so cool like if you guys if you want to target the 90s you know the 90s kids everybody that was earned that was born between 1990 maybe 1999 or whatever maybe even 1985 these kids are gonna recognize this type of design because that's how it used to look websites used to look like this but at the same time it's like if you're looking at this you know that these guys are kind of advanced but they want to give that look so green with purple kind of is a very fresh type of look it doesn't go hand in hand with a lot of designs just because it's kind of like opposite like but at the same time you can see a lot of movement within this website so you got a big block a big picture here like i was mentioning big pictures big videos are very very in right now in design so all of this is part of that so you know you go over this it shows you how to maybe even download info everything that they offer in that page so you know going back to the actual presentation here i feel like it does depend a lot what your website is gonna be based on so you're gonna wanna pay attention to what type of branding you wanna make and all of those things are gonna be super important in dictating the type of website and the type of look that you're gonna get so going back into this i feel like a big big example of right now in the industry that you can see is going to be the tesla website and we might even build it with react just because it's so good tesla man their sales have increased like freaking crazy and the only way pretty much to buy a tesla is through this website so you guys have to know that it's getting results because at the end of the day let me put my keys here actually guys at the end of the day man design is awesome but if your design is not bringing any results then it doesn't even matter you know it's not about how things look it's how it's how things perform so the tesla website has shown to perform very very well we're going to go into it right now man apparently this was the let me see so uh cool there was the the freaking seven up link popping up but we're gonna pop out the tesla website really quick for you guys so we got it right here very very very popular look at this so it's very interactive as you guys can see like i'm talking about big images are super in right now a lot of times these images even move so animations subtle animations specifically is what's going to pop a lot in your website so scrolling down a little bit you can see how it even just scrolls up or down to what specific model you're looking at so the model x right you're seeing it not only are you seeing the car but you're seeing it you know interact in its own environment so this is where model x car would probably be the most successful you know in the road next to the mountains and stuff maybe the model 3 would be cooler in the cities you're trying to you know this is more of a trip type of car so you're doing long form trips in it so they show it inside of the you know maybe the mountains maybe long roads like that model 3 is more like a citylike car so they're showing a picture of it in the city and even model s like i said it's it's more of a kind of like a highspeed type of car they're showing it where there's not many cars around and all of that is shown right here and let us see even man these guys are even showing you how the tesla would look inside of your house so all of these things are super genius man and it has a lot to do with the type of product that you're selling like i just said so you're going to want to sell a car you're going to want to sell and show mockups of how it would look in your house these are all the accessories that come with that but going back to you know the actual presentation itself tesla is a great great example of this because it's grown so much over the last years and people are loving it and like i said we're going to be creating it in the next few weeks for you guys using react using other type of technologies like that that are more web development based but right now we're going over design so let's dive a little bit deeper into all of this i feel like a good website for this too is gonna be rolex so rolex as you guys know has been uh it's it's it's withstand the test of thai man rolex is a brand that is amazing it's iconic it's cultural in so many cultures whether that's the european culture the american culture it's a symbol of success a symbol of you know having money having the money to spend on specific things and i'm telling you guys big big pictures and big videos are popping up a lot right now in design so these guys are essentially an ecommerce website and what are they doing they're showing their clocks or their watches in big big images because why i mean these are high highend type of watches so let's click on it actually so you want to see these watches kind of having you know your design has to follow the feel of the watches so these watches specifically are you know grand they're they're big they're they're expansive so the design has to kind of follow that and off the bat as you go into the website you can see here there's a big big video to just welcome you inside of the website so it says out of the blue one of september so apparently they're making a launch with one of their new watches right here they have a huge video to show it and specifically you know they're showing big no i never really see ecommerce sites that have images that are this big and like i said it's to show how grand these products are you click on one of those products you see a huge you know demo video going on and it's amazing it looks beautiful it shows you a little bit of a demo here in 3d of that actual watch and shows you the different colors of the watch so it's a huge full fullon experience of every watch that you want to buy and that's not easy man like people had to actually think about this it looks amazing like if you're gonna walk if you're gonna wanna buy a watch that's pretty much three thousand five thousand ten thousand bucks you're gonna want to see a little bit of commitment from the guys that are pretty much building that brand you know what i mean so you know going deeper into all of this this is the rolex website that's a great example that you guys can follow if you guys are doing ecommerce if you guys are doing you know highticket ecommerce all those things are great for that and now guys like you know this girl right here this blonde girl right here she's super excited to dive into designs i feel like you know i'm ready for it i want to show you guys everything that is in who's ready who's down for learning designs right now drop it in the comments below guys and smash that like button right now we're about to hit the 300 mark of likes right now in this video so i'm feeling kind of you know fun feeling kind of goofy there's so much things going on we're gonna dive deep into new designs of 2020 and one of the biggest trends that i see in design right now in 2020 is gonna be without a doubt neomorphism hands down hands down to neomorphism why it sounds like a very very hard work uh word uh it's funny i'm saying here amanath he's saying yo frankie tesla and rolex must sponsor this life long a man i would love a rolex watch right now that would be amazing man it would just add so much to the whole experience but definitely so many people are giving love let us see people are saying no i mean the two he uses to write on top of the slides the tool that i use to to right on top of this lights is either screen brush or just a presentation tool in google slides so guys you can use that if you guys want that's dope blow the horn hey let's go man neomorphism i think is a great great type of style in 2020 and what is neomorphism specifically man it's kind of a weird word it's kind of a very you know a hard word i guess new means like literally new like something that is new brand new morphism means you know morphing means forming into something so forming into something new pretty much is the etymology of that word and what is it exactly right so how does neomorphism relate to skelemorphism the cool thing about neomorphism let me actually give my presentation tool right here neomorphism came from skeuomorphism and what the frick is that man as nasa would say so one of the most interesting things about neomorphism is that it draws from both skeuomorphism and other massively popular styles so to be completely you know i want to be kind of clear with you guys because these seem like really big ports but in reality they're pretty simple to understand and skeuomorphism pretty much is you know the fact that you're getting real world objects and putting them into design so you know making buttons seem 3d kind of like if you had a calculator and you know you're seeing the objects look a little bit 3d they have a little bit of shade that would make it more of the skeomorphism type of you know vibe if you're looking to make things a little bit more kind of like the real world but at the same time making the minimalistic and digital that's more of neomorphism so it's in between making them very flat and making them very you know real world alike so neomorphism is pretty much that it's in between skeuomorphism and flat design and so yep here here they go so skelmorphism and other massively popular designs such as flat design yes both of those are opposite to each other and neomorphism falls somewhere in between that's exactly what i just said and so one of the cool things about this is like okay so what does neomorphism look like in ui design and what can it do for your products we've got the full run through for you on this new trend so we're gonna dive deep into that what is neomorphism because there's so much text there's so much type of content going on to being thrown around love it love you guys people are saying docker bunny nice hello hello facebook awesome and apple website is awesome yep that's a great website with huge images with a little bit of neomorphism and we're going to explain how that is maybe i can actually visit it on this specific light so neomorphism was born from skeuomorphism and went on to create a new entire ux style designers from all over the world have seen catchy neomorphic designs on dribble and behance and now it's a trend on its own so those are great resources to actually look into i'm gonna hit on them a little bit later in the actual presentation but for now if you guys you know want to drop off because of whatever reason you got to take care of your dog or whatever that's going to be that's going to be a good excuse for you so neomorphism going specifically into it what is it let's break it down skeuomorphism is what i said before is a very 3d design so it's pretty much representing the real world but in design so if you can see this you know look at how they're adding the shades it goes from purple to e min even almost white and they're just showing that so that you can see the dimension of the buttons right and it's cool in in my opinion dude like it looks kind of old it looks kind of like early 2000s and even 90s i kind of like it but not really like i even like the flat design a little bit more i feel like this the flat design looks pretty freaking modern and you know neomorphism like i mean sorry skeuomorphism looks all really really old flat design is hip it's nice it's light you can pretty much see everything it doesn't have any shadows whatsoever so it might not even be that hard to design to be honest with you i haven't had experience with any flat design but at the same time i don't see any like i said shadows any dimension to it so it must be easier and so the cool thing about neomorphism is that there's so many videos right now actually so many people talking about it it might actually be one of the biggest trends in 2020 in design of ui and ux and even just web design all in all so that's what's cool about it so neomorphism if you can see this pretty much it's a combination between these two so it has the 3d aspects of it as you can see around this button you can see the shadow of it so it makes it seem like it's a real live button that you're clicking and this is pretty much a calculator example of it right here you don't see any type of dimension any type of shadow to it it seems like you're just clicking on something digital but right here it's like oh damn i got a real calculator in my hand right now neomorphism like i said is going to be in between flat design and between skeomorphism and it the the way that it works is that it doesn't give so much contrast around the actual experience of using that ui ux design and here you can see a lot of contrast right there's purple there's white a lot of different contrast that makes up the dimension of things right here you can see white and gray there's not that much contrast in between of that so that's why it's beautiful this uh this is another example of neomorphism right here so as you can see this specific you know display picture it's a flower or whatever it is it looks like it's popped up so just giving it the quality of it being something you know you can see the shadows here so it means that it's actually you know it's it's it's type of representing something in the real world it's like if there was a circle or window or something like that has the shadow right here makes it look really clean there's also a little white outline around this design right now then there's like gray right here so it gives it a lot of dimension but the cool thing about this is that whenever you do click on every button it just turns a little bit grayer or it turns blue and that specific you know low type of contrast it's what is going to make your design pop a lot so we're going from gray to blue that's what's going to actually you know kind of force you or kind of just show you around the whole design so let's move right ahead another big big thing right now let me just take a drink a little sip of this coffee it's gonna be dark mode everybody if you're a developer you know drop in the comments below if you guys really love the dark mode and specific text editors like visual studio code or maybe even eclipse maybe even you know jet beams jet brains all of these type of ides and text editors adam all of those so dark mode is dope not only because it looks really cool it actually has a lot of results tied behind it and what i want to show you guys i like this picture a lot just because it actually is uh it's an example of neomorphism and it's an example of dark mode because why guys can you guys tell me why this is an example of neomorphism drop in the comments below yep be a little bit engaged guys let's keep the energy up right now we are at 375 likes oh my god let's reach 400 likes guys come on thank you guys so much for being here we're almost at 400 concurrent viewers damn i love that type of engagement guys thank you so much vs code somebody's saying a huge pandey and voice low op so my voice is kind of low let's actually talk a little bit higher for you guys so dark mode is awesome just because i think it looks more appealing to the eye to be honest with you so i'll be like me personally i'll be a little bit more engaged with an interface that is kind of black instead of something that is really white because white kind of hurts my eyes and if you guys can see here my my iphone i'm going to show it to you guys it's the black and the dark mode iphone type of you know vibe i didn't want to use the white version one specifically if you're talking technically it just is going to save a lot of your battery life you know showing black pixels versus showing white pixels is just gonna save a little bit of your life oh man we got a two dollar donation by jason francis thank you so much man he says very informative good job team thank you so much brother we really really appreciate that i love it so dark mode is awesome because of what i said it does save a little bit of battery at the same time this design right here shows the neomorphic design of you know being popped up so this looks like an actual type of maybe even like a meter something like that this shows like it's separate from this like if it was put on top of it and then this circle makes it seem as as if it was clicked you know so all of these things add to the actual like humanlike functionalities of design so i went into the rolex website but going into this specific presentation here this is another example of dark mode like i showed you guys right now this is how my iphone is so iphone recognizes this specifically so they let you go into you know whether that's the dark mode or the just the light mode the white mode that most that literally is the default mode but i think in the future probably dark mode is going to be the default you know so it's it's a very interesting thing man it's it's been picked up throughout the years people are loving it people are digging it some people cannot even use their text editor if it's not in dark mode man we just crossed the 400 like mark in this video guys let's freaking go smash this like button if you guys are enjoying this content if you guys want to learn more about design ui ux web development and all of these things thank you guys so much it really feeds us to going forward with everything and man i'm having a blast here some people are asking where is sunny sunny's gonna be live next week he's going to be showing you guys how to build great projects with the mern stack so it's going to be a full stack development project using the burn stack and going to be creating projects such as whatsapp such as i'm not even sure amazon i believe in all of these things so they're gonna be great but going back into this like i mentioned before you know visual studio code in dark mode is awesome guys i cannot use it in just a regular white mode especially if you're using windows windows a lot of times uses just the white mode the normal default mode to me it's so hard to engage in a in a text editor if i'm using this dark mode is awesome most developers do like it and why is dark mode awesome like does it just look awesome or is there actual real benefits to it well let me share that with you guys in the next slide the cool thing about dark mode is that not only does it look better in my opinion it's also it's shown to have so much more results guys this is insane i saw this picture in my mind was blown like actually drop a mindblown emoji on the chat below if you guys are liking this so this is an eye tracking test and these pretty much if you see the green you see the red all around is a heat map and what that means is that it shows the actual the user's path inside of this app right so it shows the interactivity that the user has had within the app so everything that turns a little bit more red means that the user has clicked on that way more than something that is just green so green is just like casual casual type of like you know pointing on those things but red is like where most of the users actually hit so man beautiful somebody says 361 people watching 448 likes that's a love bro thank you guys i appreciate that let's reach the 500 sorry the 500 like mark and also just hit the 10 mark maybe in chat donations guys thank you so much i'm going to show you guys how to implement all of these design trends into your own designs this year so that you can get paid so that you can get jobs so that your designs and your portfolio actually goes to the next level because ultimately that's what we want we want to see results we want to make this knowledge practical so as i was saying you can see here that the white ui wow people are kind of hitting everywhere man so if you see this people are hitting the red the green you know things all around all around that means people are not engaging in one specific area that much right so they're hitting all around here all around here they don't know where to click but in the black and the dark ui design people are actually hitting here a lot because it's red here a lot because it's red red you can see red red red red red and they're kind of playing with these other things that are more yellow yellow is obviously more warmer than green so that means people are hitting the yellow spots more than the green so using statistics using actual diagrams using actual information people are actually better directed using dark mode than using white mode and this is a prime example of this you can develop an ad or i'm sorry an app probably use dark design in that sense dark ui apparently shows so much many more results so let's keep going on another big trend this year that i pretty much freaking love man is using illustrations in ui and ux so it's funny because you know we're moving more towards the digital era we're moving more towards the clean type of vibe clean type of modern designs but at the end of the day 2019 actually was the day was the year where people were going a little bit deeper into oh wow give me some of that you know new type of digital design that is very clean very minimalistic now what's going on in 2020 is the fact that people are going back to the roots pretty much people are using illustrations a lot people are using humanlike design a lot people are using photos a lot so even i mean even i've seen you know people do graffiti typography or maybe even just handwriting typography instead of builds instead of designs and people are digging it so much we're seeing so many results from that this is another example of illustration being used in ui and ux so these illustrations you can do in different ways i would suggest using just adobe illustrator i think it's a dope dope tool i loved it man once i knew adobe illustrator i kind of didn't want to go back to photoshop just because it's it's so interesting like so intuitive in the way that like you would interact it's like kind of like a i don't know do you guys have ever used windows paint but windows paint was so fun for me when i was a young child the thing about it about adobe illustrator is that it's pretty much windows paint on steroids so you can pretty much do a lot of things with it and i bet you guys most or a lot of the designs that you see are done with that specific tool so adobe illustrator is going to be one cool thing about it another great great trend going on right now in ui and ux is gonna be the onboarding experience that you give your users and why do i say that just because man if you're actually creating svg grabbing the eyes people are saying so svg is a type of file and i think it's it's a very it's one of the best files that you can get in your designs in my opinion because you can stretch them out as far as you want or stretch them down as far as you want and they'll always keep that you know very clean quality nonpixelated quality to them so what about adobe xd so adobe xd is dope for prototyping i'm going to go over other prototyping tools later in the video and we're going to touch on that so people like nero k are saying love dark mode storyboard which software he is using so i'm pretty much using i'm literally just using you know google slides to show you guys everything that i'm doing right now what else is going on right here is that tracking for desktop or mobile so that dragon specifically was for desktop and that's the dark mode tracking that i was talking about so diving deep into the onboarding experience guys if you guys are making a new app you kind of have to give directions on how to use that app not only give directions but i like this specific diagram or picture because people are using a lot of things inside of this so what do i mean by that they're using illustration guys to show you how to use this app you know let's make apps a little bit more human this year it's not all about being digital it's not all about being clean and minimalistic it's about giving that human functionality to it that's what's going to get people to use your app a little bit more so they're using illustrations they're using right here you know reference experiences of how it's loading and all of these things so show you guys show other people that are using your app how to use your app and this is an example that i really really love duolingo is one of the biggest language apps in the world right now so let's go into this website let's see how these guys are handling their marketing their you know user experience user interface the cool thing about them is that i see off the bat you can see these guys are using illustration so you're trying to make it so that you know the most amount of people use your app so what is going to make it so that most amount of people use your app maybe you're going to want to use illustrations because at the same time you're going to be hitting kids you're going to be hitting teenagers you're going to be hitting adults with very friendly animations so we dive deep into this and oh my god we're 300 concurrent viewers thank you guys so much for sticking around here we're also almost at 500 likes on this video we're at 487 specifically thank you guys so much it's it's crazy man but going deep into duolingo you guys can see here that man illustrations are king right now so you can choose here whatever language you want and besides that these guys are actually showing you how to you know how to be on board in their specific app right so they're teaching you how to use it so teaching you that it has personalized learning it has it re it receives immediate grading it stays it keeps you you know motivated with results they give you trophies they show you improvements oh man we're at 500 likes guys let's go love it thank you so much for the love man we're gonna learn a lot during this presentation right now i hope you guys actually take it into practice actually put all of these things into your portfolio into your apps that you're building and i'm going to be showing you how we've implemented all of these things into our own builds in the last builds we've made with sunny with qazi so let's keep the love going let's keep the energy up guys like i said this is kind of their onboarding experience if you would look at it on the app it would look a little bit different but it still gives directions and it keeps everything very illustrative so like i said it hits a lot of different demographics not only young people but also old people it makes it very very friendly so let's go back to the actual presentation guys like i said this was a great example that i want to show you but there's other ones right so the onboarding experience like i said this is another example right here people are using illustrations like freaking crazy man so illustrations this is what i'm going to say neomorphism illustrations big pictures all of those things specifically with more variable type of fonts what do i mean by that i'll go deeper into that in the other part of the presentation but i feel like those things right now are the biggest things in design right now and the fact is that not only does it look good it brings results people would not use them if you don't bring results let's say let's talk about the meditation app headspace so headspace their whole marketing is pretty much done on what is it let's let's actually see if we can pull it up here so headspace is going to be interesting because it just sold as a million as a sorry billion dollar company guys billion dollar company these guys what are they using for their for their marketing for their presentation you can see here there's a lot of illustration around human photography so like i said big photos are in right now illustrations are in right now you know it shows you it gives you a little bit of direction of what you're gonna do with that app it shows you how the app looks it looks very friendly these are all animations here all the animations here it's kind of like the dark mode they're hitting the dark mode too so everybody kind of knows all of these things they're applying it to their builds so what are you guys doing if you're not applying to that so that's just one example that i really really like so going deeper into our builds how we've applied all of these things inside of our our own design is guys i want to say sunny is a freaking killer like he has been implementing this this is literally if you guys go to this url you can see our netflix clone which we built a few live streams back this is not the real netflix this is what we created as our solution to clone the netflix you know website right now so i'm gonna make it a little bit smaller for you guys the cool thing about this is that you know you you're going over this so one of the biggest things in design right now in 2020 is going to be subtle animations and the cool thing about solo animations is the fact that it pretty much directs the way that you move around this app right so going into you know all of these type of films it shows me that my cursor is being responsive to the film that i'm being on top of so it's actually you know blowing it up a little bit it's making it a little bit bigger it makes it seem as if like the app and i were connected somehow so if i want to click on it so i guess right now we don't have the functionality on but normally if we do click on it it would show the trailers let me see so it's going to show this trailer not everything has trailers but apparently this one does so i'm going to hit it it becomes very interactive and then it shows that so that's one of the ways that we implemented these subtle designs that are so in they're so they're freaking hot right now they're so hip in 2020 ui ux designs another way that we implemented all of this is with the hulu website so i actually want to go into it let me see if we actually have so apparently we don't have the the the url but i'll drop it here so it's going to be it's going to be this specifically and this is the website that we built and we built it about two days ago i was live with sunny and this channel specifically if you guys want to learn how to build a hulu app go a few days back and check out this specific live stream but even in this hulu clones sunny made a clone from hulu and as you can see as i'm hovering over it let's make it a little bit smaller so you guys can actually see more more videos or movies in the actual the website so if you go on top of it you can see that the like the date of publishing and then the type of movie or series it is it's gonna show here so you know like i said before hovering over specific things making it like have subtle animation it's going to direct your user onto how to use your specific app man so if i hover over it's going to show me that it has 78 likes it was released at this time and it's a movie so it's telling you you know it's it's actually being connected with the way that you interact with that app and that's why subtle animations are so important this year in 2020 so that was the hulu app that was a netflix app now we're gonna go into another big big trend in ui ux design in freaking 2020 we're at 400 or sorry 538 likes in this video guys let's freaking go love it thank you guys so much we're gonna hit 600 in a few seconds so what do you guys want to learn you know we're trying to dissect the biggest companies out there in the world for you guys so you guys can learn take practical knowledge from it and practically put them into your portfolio and get results like getting a job like creating beautiful websites that everybody can use and interactive websites that people are gonna enjoy using so let's go right into it so another cool thing is that gradients are super in right now so i'm giving you guys an example right now of face up sorry facebook i mean facebook does on instagram but at the same time you know in instagram right here you can see how it's using a gradient so it goes from here let me get my pointer tool so it goes from here to this to this so i remember at the beginning i didn't really like how instagram looked but at the same time i kind of grow into it man it looks really dope you know adding gradients to it adds a lot of dimension adds a lot of personality to your specific builds to your specific um design you know it makes it look very very classy somebody asked would you be teaching us neomorphism yeah my man i'll go deeper into it in other videos some people say what can i do after react.js so after react.js you can actually use react.js to use these specific tools that i'm talking about like i showed you guys we're using you know subtle animations in the the hulu clone in the netflix zone we're also using gradient type of tools in the hulu clone so if you see the background of the hulu clone that i just showed it has a gradient to it because it shows a lot of dimension it shows a lot of it's kind of like a very modern vibe and we are at 550 likes on this video guys let's freaking go let's grow this to 600 likes thank you guys so much i really appreciate this let's make the best design that we can make so that people can actually use our websites so this is another example of gradients spotify one of the biggest brands in music in the world right now shout out to you guys because you guys just bought joe rogan's podcast for about a hundred million dollars damn that's a little bit of money man that's beautiful thankfully joe rogan you know accepted that freaking that deal man because that's a lot of money so one of the biggest websites in music right now in this moment are using gradients huge amounts of gradients because why it makes it look clean it makes it look like there's depth it makes it look like it's so professional it's not just plain color i'm not saying plain color looks bad i'm just saying that gradients look really really good and everybody's using them so this is another example of a ui ux of a specific type of you know statistic tool and this is how they use gradients as you can see here things are a little bit lighter and things go boom a little bit darker to show the actual you know the the focusing of things how things grow so as you can see here it's purple and it's turning blue this is the gradient in itself also you know you can see the bars turning into gradients so it's a great way to show data you know you don't always have to have data being so plain and simple just you know maybe showing green to red you can show green to yellow to orange to red and when you do that type of gradient it's going to show so much more specific you know so much more specific progress and growth from it i see people see people here say uh devin gray actually what's up devon we talked on the phone man you remember me so joe rogan got paid and now there's no money left to pay joe biden and his podcast that's funny kind of political let's not jump into that but i love joe rogan and i wanted to mention it because spotify is killer and the cool thing about gradients is like i said it's being used all over the world so this is a website called radiant and i added it here because i love the way that this gradient look specifically and obviously guys you guys are not going to be able to mix weird colors if they just don't go together obviously you know you're going to make a gradient off of things that look good so off of the bat you know white turns to blue turns to purple turns to red turns to pink and that's just kind of natural but if you're trying to make you know brown turns to blue turns to orange turns to red it just really doesn't go you kind of have to follow color theory and i'll be i'm going to be touching about that in the next few slides but these are pretty much just examples of the gradients itself so like i said before guys you know it's not all about using gradients it's also about making your design looks cool so what i liked about this picture is that if you're looking to make you know mobile websites right now in this moment the cool thing about it is that you know first off these are complementary colors right color theory is super important if you guys don't know that stick to the end so that i can explain that to you because if you learn that if you learn color theory man you're gonna become a pro developer you're gonna learn how developers sorry designers think specifically and that's gonna bring you to the next level then you're gonna be like yo that's insane that's not how that color goes with this color whoa let's go getting a great donation by conscious code and he's donating 200 indian rupees thank you so much my brother and he is saying is that web development let me actually pull this specific let me pull it up right here guys so yup conscious code is saying um let's pull it up right here give me one second guys so boom it's taking me a second but you guys are gonna see and it's gonna be worth that so conscious code is saying is that let me pull it up so you guys can see it a little bit bigger is that web development is going to be automated by ai and there will be no jobs in this field and the field of ai machine learning will boom compared to web dev so my man airing went into a little bit more into you know ctp3 i believe gtp3 i believe it's called and there's ways for you know right now specific intelligence artificial intelligence or or actual programs to pretty much write code for you the thing about you know moving into the future is that you know robots are gonna have to kind of you know kind of catch up to this thing man we are still very much more advanced it's gonna take a few years for robots to just literally take over you know web development in general at the same time man design and trends and interactivity is always moving forward very very fast so you know robots are gonna have to catch up to that we're gonna have to program robots to learn these new techniques so man just just forget about all of that bro just grow your skills right now you know ultimately grow your skills make them very sellable skills high income skills that developers that companies can use and you'll never face the fact that you like you might have to look for other jobs if your skills are good enough then you'll be good bro don't worry about the robots don't worry about the ai and machine learning taking over your jobs if anything make sure that you learn those type of you know techniques and technologies so that you can apply them whether that's to your web development your apps or even just you know the work that you're doing in that specific moment but moving forward guys let's go into it so augmented reality is going to be a huge huge huge part of ui ux design in 2020 and why do i say that you know damn guys we're almost about to hit the 600 like mark in this video that's gonna be insane thank you guys so so much we're gonna be having a lot of fun talking about all of these different topics there's so much to talk about so much you know spice that i want to sprinkle into it augmented reality is dope just because of a few things i think it's very very practical i was i remember guys i was in i was in charlottesville virginia and i was in my cousin's uh company and their company was willowtree apps will treat applications and they're one of the biggest they're the one of the biggest big boys playing in the app development world in the east coast of the us so they're based out of virginia a lot of people don't know but virginia is a huge a huge hub for technology and why is that because they paid developers so much around 100k plus but the living expenses in virginia are just so low there's nothing compared to the to to california i live in california i'm in l.a right now beverly hills with kazi and all the team right now and that's amazing it's a blessing but at the same time sometimes i wish that the living expenses was not as high as somewhere as virginia and i was looking at specifically what is it called the microsoft the the helmet the the ar helmet augmented reality helmet i forgot what it's called guys but at the same time what was cool about it is that augmented reality adds a lot of depth to the specific you know reality of your vision that you're looking at now so if i'm looking at this computer so in front of me there's a computer in front of me right here and you guys can't see it but it's a laptop but let's say maybe this monitor because you guys can see it so the cool thing about this is that if i have something related to augmented reality whether that's an app or an actual helmet i could be able to place things on top of this maybe on top of the screen because it it responds to dimension and the cool thing about augmented reality is that we've seen it let's let's read a little bit about this specifically but we've seen huge companies use it it's not it's not oculus devin gray is saying i think it's called man let's let's actually let's actually research it guys let's take some time to research this so it's microsoft um ar helmet it's called hololens that's what it's called so it's called hololens so i was there i was using the hololens man was that mindblowing guys the cool thing about that is that i could literally reach to you know literally i could just reach my hand like this and the helmet would kind of pick up my fingers and whenever i would snap snap a menu would appear and i could actually choose what to do with that specific you know floating object whatever augmented reality object that was inside of my view so let's say just to give you guys a perspective about this let's say i'm here in this in this screen right now and i want to put a little bit maybe a world maybe a ballerina on top of this which those were specific graphics that i was looking at if i want to put a world on top of this i would just go like so i would literally snap my fingers like this and i could see a menu pop off out of here and keep in mind that i'm that i'm wearing a freaking helmet that has lenses to it and if i look over here i can see the little world you know floating around or maybe the ballerina flowing around but the way that i would do it is i would snap my fingers and i would choose it in the menu so it gives depth to the actual reality and how are companies using this so let's read a little bit about this in the last years we have seen a lot of progress excitement and improvement of augmented reality ar the world's leading tech companies are investing millions into ar development so we should expect to expand and grow this this technology in 2020. even apple has introduced their own augmented reality toolkit called ar arkit ar kids to help designers and developers build ar based products dope apple not losing time anytime soon i love it man guys we are at 620 likes on this video that is insane wow thank you guys so much it would be mind blowing to me that we can reach the 1000 likes in this video it's insane so i actually came up with this title this morning i kind of just woke up and i was like damn my alarms didn't go off like holy i'm late to this but i'm so so passionate about design just because i've seen so much effect on it so much type of so much influence that i've brought into other people's lives with design and you know apps in general are used just because of the design of them like ultimately you know the functionalities of an app is going to be what's more important than that specific ad but if you do know design then that's just going to take that functionality of that app to another level so if you team up if you're a designer like a web like a web designer with a web developer or maybe you know an app designer with a app developer something related to that map you guys can make a killer killer team so augmented reality is huge let's look into this so ikea is using augmented reality ikea as you guys know is one of the biggest if not the biggest furniture brand in the whole world these guys are i believe they're from denmark uh they're from eastern europe for sure but the cool thing about them is that they're bringing this minimalistic design and also you know using more economic materials to build furniture and that's why they're so so big the cool thing about them is that in their website let me actually put up pull up my pointer here in their website they're showing you guys how a specific sofa would look in your space so this is the space that the person has in that house and they're using ar they're literally using ar to show you how that couch will look in your house so if you add ar to your design it's just gonna take it to the next next level that's insane and so zara i know zara is literally the third or the fourth biggest company in the world right now just because i didn't know this guys did you guys know this drop it in the comments below if you knew this but textile companies companies that have to do with clothes so textile companies the owner of sarah is like the fourth or the fifth or the sixth it's one of the it's like literally one of the top 10 most richest persons in the world because not only does he and he's a spanish dude he's from spain not only does he own zara but he owns so many other textile companies so clothes are sold a lot in the world apparently and these guys wanted to use augmented reality to show you how clothes would fit on you so i don't have a specific demo of that but you know this is forbes making a freaking article about this it's a huge man i'm telling you you know you add ar to these specific selling websites and it's gonna man it the sales are just gonna go through the roof it's insane so zara like i said one of the biggest companies in the world for textiles and oh my god we just got another donation from enough aurora thank you so much brother he's donating 20 indian rupees i love it thank you so much man drop a question guys if you guys are doing some donations i would love to answer those also let's check out what's going on in the chat right now so devin gray again he says they were one of the first companies i remember that use they are i think he's talking about ikea yep ikea is super proactive in everything that is going on in technology right now so multilingual programmer says i read that future websites will use blockchain yep a lot of websites will move into blockchain not only websites but other technologies such as music and another thing oh man somebody said microsoft hololens yep that is true bro everybody was saying hololens hololens lux mikani also said hololens yeah poland is awesome guys i never knew how cool it was until i used it moving forward guys augmented reality is though because other big companies like cocacola are using them right now so let's say you know b2c which is business to consumer type of um type of businesses are really really big right now specifically we are a b2c type of business you know we are a business that sells two consumers which are people that want to become developers like you guys you know we help consumers or just normal people become developers and how do we do that you know if you guys are enjoying this content we do have the link in the description below sorry about that to become a a specific javascript developer and you guys can kill it with your javascript skills with your web development skills with this course specifically and we teach you how to become a full stack javascript developer learning react learning technology such as es6 such as javascript in general but little javascript all of these things and we have a free training down below in the comments below sorry in the description below if you guys are interested in that but you know these guys cocacola are using b2b type of technology so they're selling business to business so they're selling to other businesses and actually showing them how a specific you know cocacola machine would look in their business so let's say this is a grocery market you put your phone right here and you can see how that specific machine would look in your store so they're using ar to sell business to business that is insane guys love it i love it so much so we're gonna dive a little bit deeper into the design process right so this image is a little bit small i couldn't make it bigger for you guys but let's kind of dive into it i feel like you know some people want to have a clear view on how to create these type of designs because we've thrown a lot of information out there so you know in the beginning what i would advise man in whatever field that you guys are in empathizing is a really really smart and a huge skill that it's very hard to learn so being empathetic learning how people are feeling in the moment even gary v talks about this a lot you know empathy is great if you're a salesperson if you're into marketing if you're into web development if you're into app development if you're into just computer science in general so the cool thing about this is that you have to empathize in the beginning of your journey of the design journey so what do i mean by that so in empathizing what you're gonna do is you're actually gonna feel and think how your user is feeling and thinking because if you can't have that then you're gonna make an app that nobody wants to use you know ultimately apps are dictated and their design is dictated on how people will interact with them so you if you make it like let's say an app was really based off of this so you know apple really does have a thing that says you know we'll make the ability for each user to do whatever they want in just three clicks right so they've said something very similar to that if i want to check my messages or my notifications i don't have to do like eight clicks to get to there i don't have to go to a folder to open it up to go to another folder to go into my messages to then click on my messages and then read it nope i just go into my home screen i click on messages and i can see my messages it's literally like three clicks so you're gonna have to think about you know how users interact with your app or website and the way that you do that is by empathizing so you think about the whole user interactive journey right and after that what you do is you actually define define it so it's like okay so i want to make this the most efficient way for you to use this app what am i going to do i'm going to be empathetical and how my users are are using my app now let's define what that means so now what that means is that for you to go into messages you're not gonna have to do five clicks you're gonna have to do three clicks because i'm gonna put the app in the home store that is one of the ways that you can define things then after that you're defining them and then after that you become you start playing with ideas right so it's like okay so i'm putting my apps in the actual home screen so what does that mean you know i'm actually not gonna make it so that they have it very hard and we're almost at 650 likes guys let's go 646 likes that is amazing thank you guys so so much i appreciate this and we're going to be diving deeper into this stay tuned so you guys can learn color theory because i feel like that is going to connect all the knowledge of all of these design tools that i'm talking about so after you define how users are going to want to use your app then you're going to want to have ideas of it so yes i can put my icons in the home screen yes i can just maybe show not that many menus so that people can access my app so ideas is once you have that defined you can start you know prototyping ideas for that and then the cool thing is after the ideas boom you prototype like i just said so prototyping is cool because you know there it it really shows you ways that you can build the app before building the app so let me actually take a drink of this and then after that i'll just answer a little bit of you guys comments because i see that you guys are dropping a lot a lot of love let's go yup so some people are saying zagar thiagi he says they don't teach these things in college you have to learn on your own that is very very true man they don't even teach it in companies sometimes man you learning out of experience other people not using your apps other people using your apps that's how you're kind of going to learn all of these things so going into prototyping man prototyping is awesome just because ah man i personally love prototyping because before building the actual app you can just design it you can just design the whole user experience of the app what does that mean you pretty much add you know how you're gonna use like how many clicks it's gonna take you to do any specific function where you know your picture is showing and whoa we just got another donation by deepak let's go deepak thank you so much man yesterday you helped us pass the 200 mark man i really really appreciate that and he's donating 150 indian rupees so love it man he's saying nice content informative love it thank you so much deepak so prototyping i'm going to talk about a few tools is pretty much you brainstorming the design that you're going to do for that and then after that obviously like any good software developer will tell you after the code after the build you're going to want to have to test obviously test even if you know you're a college student i feel like you know testing your code is one of the most important things that you can do i was even telling sonny that yesterday i'm like bro one of the the things that i like the most about your development is that you implement right off the bat what the first thing you do is test and i see that that saves you so much time and you have to implement that into your regimen into your coding resume so moving forward into this one of the biggest biggest biggest things that i can actually recommend you guys to do is check out figma.com if you guys are you know designing any web app any application the cool thing about figma is that one of like first of all it looks professional af like holy it looks amazing the cool thing about it is that it has drag and drop functionalities to it so that's beautiful all in its own so look right here you can it literally tells you the dimension of pixels between the xaxis and the yaxis so if you guys are a little bit nerdy in that you know you can pretty much show the template that you're building stuff in and it's going to tell you the specific sizes of specific windows the cool thing about thing man that i love the most the most that that's just actually why i wanted to share with you guys is the fact that let me actually write it here people are saying ligma thick my bruh figma so let's write that in the comments below you guys are seeing that come up so figma is awesome because if you do drag and drop drop functionalities on your app it's going to show you the css code it's going to show you the html code that you're going to want to use for your build so you know after building them as drag and drop functionalities you can actually get the css code in that html code like i said in even a little bit of that javascript code depending on what specific animation or movement you do on that app so all those things are part of figma i think it's a great great way to implement new things into ui and ux figma.com guys check it out so another cool thing right here that i see is pc.js website so on my other video the top seven javascript libraries we talked about pixie js and pxjs is an awesome library for javascript right now the cool thing about it is that huge companies such as disney are using it literally disney disney is one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world and if they're using pixie js then you have no reason why not to use pixie js if you're doing anything animation like the cool thing about pcjs is that it uses 3d graphics and also two 2d graphics to take it to the next level there's also cool libraries like 3d 3 3js that actually you know brings three 3d specific designs to the next level but going into this these were designed by goodpoint digital company and it's awesome they're using javascript like i said so one of the biggest biggest things that i wanted to share with you about this specific you know pc.js website is the fact that for you to learn the most guys it's really not about the skill set that you have it's really not about you know how you're gonna implement all of this it's not about you know where you wanna go in your career it's not about anything of that guys at the end of the day results results dictate everything results dictate design results dictate the way that you're gonna you know make a website because if you're not selling anything with really nice design then you're not going to want to use that design if you have an ecommerce website so my recommendation for you guys is if you're starting off with becoming a frontend developer a ui developer a ux developer what you're going to want to do is copy top designers you don't want to start from scratch you don't want to think like oh yeah this looks good but then have no reference experience of why it looks good you're going to want to copy top designers in the world right now that are showing their things such as sony xperia or literally this day or literally all of these huge companies that are using these technologies and i always say this it's not about how good you are but it's about what type of design or style you have because your style is gonna dictate the design so if you have a very outdated style it's gonna dictate your design if you have a modern style it's gonna dictate your design if you have a very interactive modern minimalistic style it's gonna dictate your design learn from the top designers in the world right now so we're gonna go into this a lot of the things that people you know wanna break things into is gonna be the layout which is pretty much the ui placement spacing the padding the grids of the specific build the navigation which pretty much is the placement and the size of the navigation bar whether that's on the top and the bottom in the middle that typography is super duper important in terms of branding in terms of design all this because it gives the feel of the whole brand the whole website that you want to do so font sizes the line height and then sarah for sans serif which is pretty much very basic typography is based on helvetica most of the the the fonts are really based on helvetica if you if you guys want to research that that's dope it was mindblowing to me so icons are dope we go over a huge libraries that people love right now which are pretty much you know material ui bootstrap and all of these because you know you're going to want to save time and people have already gathered those resources for you so use icons that are very in right now very very modern very minimalistic add them to your own design and another thing is going to be background as you can see you can see gradient or photo used so like i mentioned before gradient is super in right now in design so make sure to not only use plain colors use gradients because they look so so well put together and also if you're using a background you might want to think about adding a big photo in there because it just adds so much more of that humanlike you know humanlike specific you know functionality to it as well as also it adds a lot of a little bit of more of of character to it i feel it's kind of crazy i love it guys so we are at 700 sorry 672 likes whoa that's insane man if we reach 700 i would pretty much piss my pants that's insane i never expected this so i'm just you know getting my coffee right now i'm like yo just you know researching a bit trying to help you guys out with everything it's insane thank you guys so much for getting a lot of value from this i don't want you guys to just listen to all of this i want you guys to actually implement it because at the end of the day so many developers so many people have gotten jobs off of our videos off of actually implementing these practicalities that we talk about every single day so make sure you do that and let's not just stay stagnant so now i want to touch on color theory and let me just take a sip of this i'll dive into that deeply because i'm super passionate about color theory and if you guys learn this specifically then you're going to be able to learn so many other things whether that's with design ux ui or fun and development so let's dive right into it after the sip of coffee so what's cool about color theory guys is some people think most of the people that i talk to whether they're frontend developers whether they're web developers or web designers most people don't know the psychology of color so we're humans right and humans have like you cannot ignore the psychological aspects of humans ever because whether that's with code you know sometimes in code it's really hard for you to be you know engaging the code whether that's because you're feeling bored whether that's because you don't have any community or likeminded individuals behind you everything has to do with how you process everything psychologically and color is a thing that you do process psychologically just like anything else and let's say let's let's actually give examples to this right so most of the big companies that you see right now in the world are actually think about their logo so facebook logo what color is it it's blue right think about twitter logo what color is it it's blue right think about i don't know what other color what other logo is blue so many colors like so many logos are blue it's insane but the cool thing about blue logos is the fact that blue is pretty much a synonymous psychological trigger for confidence for secure most importantly trust so i think in my opinion trust is the most important um aspect of the blue color loyo cleanliness progress powerful calm masculine success responsible authoritative blue is an example of all of this and it's literally like guys like literally it's not random facebook didn't want to be blue because it's random nope these guys know color psychology so whenever you're doing web development web design fun and design think about the psychology of the colors that's going to take you to the next level how people respond to your specific apps another one would be red so red is synonymous for excitement for youthful active leader passion powerful radical excited bold energy confident hot energy youthful pioneering and urgency the most important one right here in my opinion would be urgency so all of these pretty much are synonymous for urgency so everything that is read just like if you think about in the real world red means blood pretty much if you see blood it's like holy that's urgent we have to take care of that right now let's go you know we're pretty much we're pretty much animals you know we're pretty much part of nature and we have triggers that you know did develop because of color so all of these are part of that purple has to do with elegance has to do with royalty it has to do with you know romantic mystical experience all of that that is why a lot of royal type of colors are gonna be purple you know if kings used to use purple it's a very hard color to get and at the same time it just gives so much more functionality to whatever you're building and devin gray says facebook twitter bluehost jira bitbucket basically all of atlassan so all of these companies do use blue you know that's what i'm trying to say and zoom uses uses blue true color uses blue skype uses blue google dual uses blue devon gray is saying microsoft uses blue guys it's no it's really no um coincidence these guys know these things so color theory if you want to take your next level if you want to go to the next level in design specifically so like i said guys you know the psychology aspects of this is going to be insane and one of the biggest and hardest part about programming is being able to program alone to build things alone and not with the team which is very much retracted from real reality in most of programming you're going to have to work with a team and in my opinion if you really want to up your skills want to be part of a huge huge huge community of 1500 active developers on the daily make sure to check out the link in the description below guys we have a free one hour training that teaches you guys how to become a profitable javascript developer learn all the skills from basic javascript to full stack javascript to even react all of these tools that pretty much you need to get a job and i'm not saying this out of my ass so many people have gotten jobs out of this specific training this specific program and guys you know we're pretty much tribal individuals let's go into creating communities creating people you know creating circles where people are engaged and we can learn from them and work together so let's go back to all of this make sure to check out that link in the description below go to our free onehour training to become a javascript developer going back into brand color psychology like i said before blue is trust dependable green is more of a peaceful type of healthy vibe the orange is optimistic yet it's also kind of like warning like it grabs your attention and then you know salmon type of color is more of a friendly type of uh a little bit feminine type of color but also you know feminine but neutral and then pink slash red is kind of more exciting it's kind of more grabs your attention more like urgent type of thing purple is more like creative kind of like royal kind of like you know visualization type of thing and gray which is a very very neutral is a very calm color so all of these things are part of the color psychology chart and you should pay attention to it also color theory a lot of people don't talk about this specifically but there's primary there's secondary and there's tertiary colors if you're designing anything guys you guys have to pay attention to this specifically so let me see what's going on in the comments right now guys we've been live for one hour and 15 minutes which is pretty freaking awesome i love to share this knowledge with you guys some people are saying can you tell me how to use 3js officially to make movie like website intros man i'll show you an example right now josh is actually saying that and bro i actually didn't want to go through websites that use 3js because they're so dope they're so in like holy crap these guys make it an experience 3js is not only design it's also an experience and in my opinion that's where design is going to go in the future so that's a pretty cool comment right there some people like cigar are saying although i have been working on it since two years but still i feel you can never learn the whole thing so logically i'm still learning but technically it took me one and a half month to start working on it so cigar what are you talking about specifically bro let us know are you talking about web development web design what specifically so that's pretty cool so hemant says can someone review this i'm purchasing this and we'll work on that i don't want to be a developer but instead my view is work as an entrepreneur brother and we're talking about profit with javascript go into the description below check out that training maybe buy the course if you're interested and you see any benefit in joining to that because at the end of the day we base a lot of our designs into you know our builds we build a lot of a lot of our projects with these specific designs just because we know it is what is in right now in the industry because that's the things that are actually going to get you results so you want to base your builds out of results you just don't want your code to look and be functional you want it to be actually beautiful for people to use you want to give users a real experience that's why user experience in user interface people are paid so well even you know above the six figure mark because you would never use facebook if if if the you know what i mean like you would never use facebook or instagram if the actual design of it was sucky you would never use it the functionalities are great but the way that it kills it is that it takes a lot of psychological remarks and references into its design and that's what takes it to the next level that's what makes it addictive for people to start using they think about all of these things guys it's not just random so going into the color wheel like i was talking about so all of these things let me bust out my little presentation tool so primary is gonna be it's funny because people don't know this a lot of people don't know this there's only three primary colors all of the colors in the world are based out of these three colors i'm not you there's three colors okay there's five colors let's say that three primary colors which is red blue and yellow and you can do myriad thousands millions in combinations of these three colors but the two other colors i want to hit on right now is going to be black and white so the primary colors in my opinion are going to be red blue yellow black and white because if you do a mixture of black and white then you get gray but those are the main colors in the world and we're at 697 lines baby let's go you know design is a beautiful things guys it's it's it's if you do end up you know putting this into your work into your builds it's gonna take your bills to the next level we're about to reach the 700 like mark so make sure to like that video smash that like button share with other people like you other of your design friends whether that's a maybe a web designer a web developer maybe a graphic designer maybe a frontend developer all of these guys can take so much value off of this and if you guys can bounce ideas off of each other then that's gonna take you to the next level and we just crossed the 700 like mark guys let's freaking go love it we're at seven dollars and seventy cents in chat revenue i cannot be more grateful with you guys than right now in this moment but going back into color theory man what's cool about color theory i'll teach you guys a little bit about it i mean i can't go so much so deep into it because it's going to take it can literally take me hours to explain to you guys and i can show you you know different types of people that used to like picasso like jackson pollock and and huge great painters and designers in the world that stood the time of the test of time are using color theory so let's say okay let's say i'm i'm right now you know mixing red with yellow what color would that give me so i'm mixing two primary colors so if i mix a primary with the primary i'm gonna get a secondary color which would be orange guys if you mix two primary colors then you're gonna get a secondary color right and that's that's dope a lot of people don't know that but if you join like let's say i'm mixing yellow which is a primary and blue which is a primary i'm gonna get green guys that's what's cool about it so two primary colors make a secondary color and the way that you make tertiary colors is for example i'm gonna be i'm gonna be doing a primary with the secondary right so if you do a primary with a secondary let's say red i'm doing red i'm mixing red with violet then i'm going to get a tertiary color which is red violet so secondary colors are made by mixing two primary colors the three primary colors literally right now in the world are just red blue and yellow all colors are based out of those colors so you mix red with yellow which both of them are primary colors then you're going to get orange which is the secondary color but let's say you want to mix a primary color which is red and a secondary color which is orange so you're going to get you know primary mixed with secondary color is gonna give you a tertiary color and i don't remember specifically but i learned this in one of my art classes the fact that if you mix i think more than four colors or more than three colors all in one it's always gonna give you brown that was mindblowing to me i was like what the it like it's always gonna give you brown and i tested it and it is true if you mix more then i think that's why there's not more than the tertiary tier of colors because if you mix more than this you're just going to get brown everything turns to brown everything turns to you know at the end of the day so this is kind of how this works and let me just tell you guys if you guys are doing design you guys are one and gonna you're gonna want to use the complementary colors so i don't think it has it on this chart let me see if i have it in the other chart no i don't have it but right now like let's say for example yellow so the color wheel how it works is that normally colors are based and put here because in the opposite part of it then you can see the freaking opposite so for example yellow the opposite of yellow is going to be violet or purple that's why these are put together the opposite of blue is going to be orange that's why these are particular the opposite of red is going to be green that's where these are put together same with here so yellow green the opposite of this is going to be red violet so if you guys are doing designs if you guys are looking at color palettes always have color theory in mind take some time to learn about it because that's what's gonna dictate your design that's what gonna that's what's gonna make it look and go to the next level now when you guys see colors in design you guys are going to be able to actually be like oh like these guys are using you know these are called complementary colors so the opposite colors are are called complementary like oh no wonder easter is made of yellow and purple no wonder christmas is made out of red and green you know no wonder everybody that is going crazy on actual color grading and just you know what's it called yeah literally color grading in movies is blue and orange everybody's going crazy with blue and orange which is teal and orange pretty much so color theory is super duper important if you don't know anything about it man this just adds so much context in your life so really learn about it and two of the things that i want to actually mention here is now that i went over all of this and hopefully you guys could take a lot of benefit a lot of actual you know value from all of this is i want to drop a little bit of resources for you guys for you guys to actually use one of the biggest resources that i've been able to use myself is going to be dribble.com and that's dribble with three b's the cool thing about this is that dribble actually shows you you know huge examples of people that have you use the designs that are really right now hip really right now you know busting the industry people are using them so much and you can base yourself get inspiration out of all of these so this is an example of an illustration this is an example of illustration in an app this is an example of you know making it a little bit more humanistic as well as illustration this is also like we talked about this looks like a freaking like a card that would look like neomorphism and there's not a there's not that much contrast so all of these things are put together so that you can kind of pretty much you know have direction on how to move through that app so dribble is gonna be a great great resource for you to use this specifically now going back to the presentation guys um dribble is awesome three b's don't forget that i was writing dribble with two b's damn that's i was like what the like it was not working then somebody in the comments below dropped like hey dude it's with three b's and i'm like oh man thank you so much but people get confused with that so another one of the biggest design websites right now that you can take as a resource is going to be elements.envato.com or envato.com you know this website is dope not only because it shows you just like dribble it it gives you great examples of what is very much in in the industry right now so it gives you an example of a social media booster kits of you know a website of a farmer like how you can show your freaking produce like just specifically how to you know move around the city which is a specific you know example of color how you can brand your own website as logo all of these things envato is a great great resource that i've known for years and years to come but at the same time man envato is really cool not only because it's it's very important for you but you're if you're an actual designer but also it's a great way to have a designer community in your life so you can post your designer profile in envato and actually comment on other people's builds on their posts giving props for him all that and ultimately you know teach him that like yo this is maybe not this may not be the best design your colors here was kind of off bro those were not complementary colors use three tertiary colors and it kind of looks brown to me so it doesn't look that good you know so all of those things are going to be able to you know you're going to be able to use them at the end of this presentation so like i said guys don't just take the theory of it make it practical put it in your builds put it in your apps put it in your websites that's what's going to take you to the next level that's what's going to take you to actually get a job with these things so like i said before ui ux designers get paid very very well we're going to check out the actual how much they get paid here in the us at the end of this another great example of where you can actually get um you know resources for web development app development web web app development is going to be pinterest some people think that pinterest is just for girls some people think that pinterest is just to pretty much decorate your house and all of this but no brother pinterest is awesome for recipes no i'm kidding but pinterest is awesome because it really does show you different examples of design the thing that i like about intro pinterest is that for example one of the biggest things in my opinion is that it shows you very modern design whether that's app design web design or just you know design in general whether that's typography or just color and everything in between all of that and the cool thing about pinterest is the fact that you can pretty much just type in app design or you can type in web design or you can type in graphic design anything of that sort and you're gonna see how modern they are most of these designs most of the minimalist style of design comes from eastern europe you know that's where helvetica came to helvetica is the most minimalist and modern um font that most fonts are based out of there's actually a cool film that you can check out if you check out on youtube right now history of helvetica you're going to see this film i don't remember what it's called i believe it's just called helvetica and it shows you how all of the fonts in the world right now the modern fonts are built out of helvetica and yep it was built and made in the i think 1960s in eastern europe so a lot of that minimalist design that you guys see whether that's in furniture like ikea or design like in the web development designs that we're seeing now or the fun designs that we're seeing now are based out of eastern europe and a lot of eastern european design is made and shown in pinterest and that's something that i freaking love that's one of the best you know resources that i can share with you guys and so that pretty much brings us to a wrap and here i you know i'm showing a gift right now people are saying uh this is amazing wow when the upload react.js scratch course bro people are asking about the reaction is course from scratch guys it's going to come in the next week but i do want to share with you guys that all of these skills all of these things that you can practically put into your portfolio into your projects are gonna make it so much more beautiful they're gonna make it so much more powerful people are gonna use it they're gonna stick with it they're actually gonna you know you're actually gonna see results from it so a lot of people make apps that are just functional but at the same time they don't look good and if you have this ability to make it interactive to make it so that people get addicted to your ad man i cannot share with you how many results you're gonna get in that but let's touch a little bit about what people are dropping in the comments right now the castile says i know some logo with yellow and black it looks awesome so yellow and black is actually a great great combination brother i know dan walker and instagram drops very fire content so make sure to like dan walker too you know this guy is most of his design does go around yellow and black it's a great great um you know a design pattern it doesn't all have to follow the color wheel but the color wheel is going to show you exactly you know what colors you can blend together and what colors look good too so yellow and purple looks awesome but yellow and black looks amazing because of the the contrast of that design at the same time i know for a fact that if you're using yellow and you're using white font it's not going to look good it's actually kind of like a principle in design that you're not supposed to use yellow font on white background or white background in yellow font because it's very hard for the eye to see so all of these things are just like you know little details that people sometimes don't know so abdullah says what's up abdullah love it man i saw that you got an affiliate sale some days ago congrats to you brother appreciate that and he says ui ux holds a specific place in the popularity of the website let's say and of course you would like to pick colors which are appealing to the users or which are lighter on the eye that is true my man a lot of new you know modern websites are using colors that are very very easy for the eyes so they use purple they use gray they use white not so much black maybe black to pop up the colors that you're using but subtle colors that don't show that much contrast and that's going back into the actual neomorphistic design that i was talking about you guys so some people are saying this is dope the next level level the next level of knowledge garuf says is human computer interaction course is important to boost our ux portfolio human computer interaction course so i think human computer interaction is what a lot of colleges are using or to call you know the fact that design has a lot to do with the human psychology and it's dope and i mean i don't know much about it but i know for a fact that if you base your design on human psychology how people are gonna interact with your app it's just gonna it's just gonna make it that much more appealing that much more addictive that much more easy to use so all of those things are amazing and ricardo bermudez says frankie saludos is the colombia beautiful man mucho gusto my friend ricardo como estas amigo aqui nomas compartendo poco del disenos super important super important to learn design so guys i think that is going to be a wrap for you guys and i mean hopefully you guys can get a lot of content a lot of value from this and something resha says i'm colorblind and good in front end but always gets confused in color that's funny man like become being actually colorblind and being a ux designer that's awesome one of my cousins he's actually uh he right now he's a full stack javascript developer he's amazing in front and the guy is colorblind bro like he's an amazing artist and at the same time he's color blind so i don't think that's gonna hold you back from your career from actually applying all of these tools i really really appreciate this so yep that's a wrap guys thank you so much hopefully you guys can apply all of this if you guys see this as useful then go over to our description below check out our free one hour training to show you how to become a full stack javascript developer from basics of

it thank you guys so much this was a blast for me make sure to drop in the comments below if you guys enjoyed this type of teaching these type of knowledge because i'm i'm super duper into design guys i love it so much ever since i got a graphic design course in college my life literally changed and i could just apply it anywhere whenever i would look at billboards whenever i would look at apps whenever i would look at websites i'd be like hmm that design is a little bit off i think it's interesting how they're not using you know just complementary colors or just colors and color wheel and like holy like i can actually dissect designs and styles now just because of this so design is a beautiful thing that you can add to your builds and i think it'll take you to the next level if you
