00:00 - - Hey you, what is up?
00:01 - In this video, I want to share something
00:04 - very amazing with you.
00:05 - I also thought it was really funny,
00:07 - it was actually a
comment that first I read
00:09 - it and it got me a little tilted.
00:11 - Then I read it more, and
then it just started making
00:13 - me laugh, and this video is really gonna
00:15 - be about why having patience will kill you
00:19 - and your dreams and leave
you in a life of mediocrity
00:22 - at times, and will might
even kill your programming
00:26 - career or the very best,
take you a very long time
00:30 - to actually even have one career, alright?
00:32 - So, okay so without any further ado,
00:33 - let's jump right into it.
00:35 - So, this is the comment, okay
I'm gonna read it to you.
00:38 - So this guy, his name is Tanner Barcelos,
00:41 - he commented on my recent video called
00:43 - How Long Does It Take To
Be A Software Developer?
00:45 - And basically, oh and by the way
00:48 - before I continue, this is
day 10 of my video challenge
00:51 - where I'm doing one video a day,
00:53 - so if you want to follow
me on this challenge
00:55 - and instead of you doing
a video like I'm doing,
00:58 - you can make yourself disciplined
00:59 - and structured to do coding.
01:01 - Lots of people are following along,
01:03 - I'll put some of those people up here,
01:05 - and they're talking to me on Instagram.
01:06 - So if you want to follow
me on this channel
01:08 - and keep yourself accountable as well,
01:10 - follow me on cleverqazi, my Instagram,
01:14 - and then you can tag me in your stories
01:15 - and I'll give you a shout-out.
01:17 - Okay, so here is how the comment goes.
01:18 - The comment by Tanner
Barcelos on that video goes,
01:21 - it'll take a day or two
to learn the fundamentals
01:23 - of a language syntactically.
01:25 - YouTube tutorials like
thenewboston, Coding Dojo, etc.
01:29 - But it takes years, a
whole career to master.
01:32 - There's no way you build a 10,000 line C++
01:35 - program and sell it for
$50 million tomorrow
01:39 - off of two days of learning coding.
01:41 - LOL, this is what makes me feel better
01:43 - about my current coding abilities.
01:44 - And then he goes, I'm in school learning,
01:47 - going to be starting side projects soon,
01:49 - and I know so much, but that so much
01:51 - is only a tiny percent of
the whole 99% I don't know
01:53 - in C++ for this class's case.
01:56 - Make me write a Hello World program.
01:58 - Make me write a
hundred-line calculator app.
02:00 - I'll do it, but make me
write a 500-line program
02:04 - using searching and sorting algorithms.
02:07 - Nah, haven't taken those courses yet,
02:10 - I can't do it and that's the beauty,
02:11 - learning through time.
02:12 - And you know what I say to that?
02:13 - Fuck that bullshit, okay?
02:16 - That's what's keeping a lot of you
02:17 - in the exact place where you are,
02:19 - where you can't get a
job, or you can't get
02:22 - the results you want, or you can't get
02:24 - things fast enough.
02:26 - That was my life for a
very, very long time.
02:28 - So this kind of patience is what's keeping
02:31 - a lot of the people in the same place
02:33 - where they are for a very long time,
02:35 - especially when it comes to programming,
02:37 - especially when it gets, comes to getting
02:39 - a freelance job or even
building something,
02:41 - these are self-imposed limitations.
02:44 - And the reason why they make me so angry
02:46 - is because that's exactly where I used
02:48 - to be and where I was.
02:49 - I would have so many
limitations around myself.
02:51 - I still do, but I was able to
change a lot of things, okay?
02:55 - When it came to workout, I was able
02:57 - to get results pretty fast
'cause I didn't believe
02:59 - in that realistic patience
mindset after a certain point.
03:02 - Same thing when it came to coding,
03:03 - same thing when it came to boxing,
03:04 - chess, whatever have you.
03:06 - So, this person I truly understand
03:08 - where he is coming from.
03:09 - He's trying to appreciate
the power of patience.
03:11 - He's in it for the long
haul, and that's great.
03:15 - But to say make me write a
hundred-line program, I'll do it.
03:18 - Make me write a 500-line program, no.
03:20 - I gotta take courses for that, okay?
03:23 - What he's doing, he's being
a little bitch, alright?
03:26 - Sometimes I'll get in your face like this,
03:27 - so if you can't watch it, just quit out
03:30 - of the video and watch somebody
03:31 - else's fake bullshit video, okay?
03:33 - But I'm gonna get very real
with you here on this channel.
03:36 - If you have that
attitude, you're not gonna
03:38 - be able to do anything in life,
03:39 - 'cause you're gonna be
waiting for a handout.
03:41 - These are the same people who try
03:42 - to get, who wait for a
handout for the world
03:45 - to come to them to give them a chance.
03:48 - Why can't you write a 500-line program?
03:50 - This is the same reason
why it's really difficult
03:53 - for people to do anything, okay?
03:54 - So if you put this limitation on yourself
03:56 - that you've gotta be certain good
03:58 - or you have to have a certain amount
03:59 - of courses to write a 500-line program,
04:03 - you're never gonna be able
04:04 - to write a 500-line program, okay?
04:05 - For example, even I don't know
so many sorting algorithms.
04:08 - Dude, I used to learn
this shit in college.
04:10 - I don't remember any of
these sorting algorithms.
04:13 - I don't know any data science
04:14 - or machine learning algorithms,
04:16 - but you know what I do know?
04:17 - I know that somebody else
out there knows the answer.
04:21 - So if I'm building a project
and I'm building something
04:24 - and it needs a sorting
algorithm, guess what?
04:27 - I'll stack overflow it, I'll Google it,
04:30 - I'll look for the answer,
I'll ask for the answer.
04:32 - When I need to learn a sorting algorithm,
04:35 - I'll go learn that
specific sorting algorithm,
04:37 - come back, and apply it into my program.
04:40 - But to wait to learn this
stuff before you ever
04:43 - start anything, that's what'll keep you
04:45 - from creating any projects,
that's what'll keep you
04:48 - from having stuff on your resume.
04:50 - That's what will keep you from applying
04:52 - to a job 'cause you're waiting
04:53 - for something to get you ready.
04:55 - You are waiting for a college course
04:57 - to give you a certification.
04:59 - You're waiting to get a degree,
05:01 - a piece of paper so
you can apply somewhere
05:03 - and make a name for yourself.
05:05 - It's all bullshit man,
it's all bullshit, okay?
05:08 - I didn't know anything, I was a nobody,
05:10 - I didn't wait, I just
started making videos.
05:12 - I started documenting my own journey.
05:14 - Look at my older videos,
I didn't even know how
05:16 - to fucking make a video that fits
05:18 - on a normal screen on YouTube.
05:19 - I made videos that fit
half-assed cropped screen.
05:23 - Me explaining things and
the stupidest concepts.
05:25 - Me explaining the easiest stuff,
05:27 - and that landed me
freelancing opportunities,
05:30 - job opportunities,
clients will pay me 100,
05:32 - $150 an hour, okay?
05:37 - And then the worst part,
this guy's comment, right?
05:39 - Tanner's comment got six thumbs up,
05:41 - so there is six other
people who are thumbsing up
05:45 - that self-imposed limitation like
05:47 - what the actual fuck, right?
05:49 - Why are you putting so many
limitations on yourself?
05:53 - Why are you fighting and voting up
05:56 - for self-imposed limitations?
05:58 - Why are people encouraging that, okay?
06:01 - It's the same way where when somebody
06:03 - is overweight, it's okay
06:05 - to love yourself and love your body, okay?
06:09 - But if you have a
disease, you have obesity,
06:12 - do not encourage that, right?
06:14 - You don't want to encourage somebody else
06:16 - to have that lifestyle.
06:18 - One of the biggest diseases and problems
06:19 - in the United States of
America is obesity, okay?
06:22 - So why would you encourage
that to somebody, okay?
06:26 - You want them to feel a
little bit of pressure
06:28 - to change, to be impatient
and get the results faster.
06:32 - That same person can be fired up so much
06:35 - that in one year, they
can lose 200 pounds,
06:37 - or that same person can take
10 years to lose 100 pounds
06:40 - or 10 pounds, okay?
06:42 - You don't want to be that person, right?
06:43 - Most people in the world, in life,
06:46 - and in coding are those people.
06:47 - They're, we'll just patiently learn,
06:49 - we'll just patiently build projects,
06:52 - and we'll just let the college teach us
06:55 - or let some kind of job
opportunity come to us or teach us.
06:58 - That's it for my rant,
I hope this inspires you
07:01 - to get off your ass, stop waiting
07:03 - for some kind of course, start doing shit
07:05 - and as you need to learn it, you go out.
07:07 - Dude, if you need to
do a sorting algorithm,
07:10 - hit up software developers on LinkedIn
07:12 - and be, yo, this is my thing
I'm working on, help me, okay?
07:16 - I'm willing to learn, help me.
07:18 - If you reach out to
people with that passion
07:20 - and fire, I promise you there's gonna
07:22 - be some unbelievable developer who will
07:23 - be, you know what?
07:24 - I'll teach you man, or
teach you girl or a woman.
07:27 - Or you have two kids, full-time job,
07:29 - you're busy, I'll teach
you for half an hour
07:31 - or an hour, it inspires me.
07:34 - But if you're gonna put
self-imposed limitations,
07:36 - then six other fucking
people are gonna come
07:37 - in, thumbs up that shit,
pose more self-limitations.
07:42 - You're not gonna get very far
07:43 - in your career and in your life.
07:44 - So, that's my message for today.
07:46 - What my mission is is
that I hope that you see
07:48 - this and you go okay, I'm
gonna change something
07:50 - and you start following
me on that, the challenge
07:52 - I'm doing for the next 20 days,
07:54 - I'm gonna be making 20 more videos,
07:56 - probably even more than 20 videos, okay?
07:57 - But follow me on that journey.
07:59 - You can do coding for
20 days or more days.
08:02 - Start a 30-day coding challenge, okay?
08:05 - Follow me on Instagram
so you can see behind
08:06 - the screens what I'm doing.
08:08 - Tag me, go #30DayChallenge.
08:10 - #cleverqazi, okay?
08:12 - I will put that up for you so
I can hold you accountable.
08:15 - Whatever it is for you
okay, you don't have
08:17 - to follow me on Instagram, you don't have
08:18 - to do any of that, but I'm saying,
08:20 - get off your ass, put in the work,
08:22 - don't have self-limitations,
please you have
08:25 - a lot more potential than you think, okay?
08:27 - And thank you for being on this channel
08:29 - listening to my rant.
08:30 - Please comment and let
me know what you think
08:32 - about this, okay?
08:33 - Where is your head at with this,
08:35 - put it in the comments below.
08:36 - I'm very active nowadays so I'll come
08:37 - in, I'll answer almost
everybody's comment,
08:40 - and other than that, all I want to say
08:42 - is thank you so freaking much for being
08:44 - on this channel, I love your face.
08:46 - And as always, I'll see
you in the next video.
08:50 - (offbeat music)

Cleaned transcript:

Hey you, what is up? In this video, I want to share something very amazing with you. I also thought it was really funny, it was actually a comment that first I read it and it got me a little tilted. Then I read it more, and then it just started making me laugh, and this video is really gonna be about why having patience will kill you and your dreams and leave you in a life of mediocrity at times, and will might even kill your programming career or the very best, take you a very long time to actually even have one career, alright? So, okay so without any further ado, let's jump right into it. So, this is the comment, okay I'm gonna read it to you. So this guy, his name is Tanner Barcelos, he commented on my recent video called How Long Does It Take To Be A Software Developer? And basically, oh and by the way before I continue, this is day 10 of my video challenge where I'm doing one video a day, so if you want to follow me on this challenge and instead of you doing a video like I'm doing, you can make yourself disciplined and structured to do coding. Lots of people are following along, I'll put some of those people up here, and they're talking to me on Instagram.
