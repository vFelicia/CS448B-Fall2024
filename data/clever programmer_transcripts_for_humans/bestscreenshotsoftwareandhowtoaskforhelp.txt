00:02 - clever programmer calm first of all I
00:04 - came in with a sexy hair cut and this
00:06 - new thing that I got for my seat it's
00:09 - pretty nice pretty comfortable arm today
00:12 - I wanted to talk with you guys about
00:14 - this amazing software for screenshot eng
00:17 - if you don't have it i don't know what
00:18 - you're doing with your life also i want
00:20 - to teach you how to actually ask for
00:22 - help from anywhere in the world to the
00:24 - point where it's so easy for people to
00:26 - help you that it doesn't even make sense
00:29 - for them to not help you okay so let's
00:32 - cover that kind of one step at a time so
00:34 - first of all I just want to talk about
00:35 - the help thing if you were trying to
00:38 - post it in the forums or you're trying
00:40 - to ask somebody for help and I don't
00:41 - care if it's about coding or really
00:42 - anything in life the person you're
00:45 - trying to ask for help you want to make
00:47 - sure that it's extremely easy for them
00:49 - to answer your question so if your code
00:52 - is broken don't just go my codes are
00:55 - broken and just panic or if some if
00:58 - there's something in life just go
01:00 - there's something wrong I don't know
01:01 - what's going on because the more vague
01:03 - your question is the harder it is for
01:06 - somebody to help you because they really
01:08 - don't know what's going on so if you can
01:11 - make it very specific with what you need
01:13 - help with and I know sometimes it's
01:14 - annoying to do that but if you can do
01:16 - that you will find out that you get help
01:21 - many many times and also another thing
01:23 - you'll discover is that you'll end up
01:25 - answering your own question throughout
01:27 - this process so that was the first part
01:31 - about how to kind of ask for help and
01:34 - the tool that i want to show you that is
01:36 - an amazing productivity tool and also it
01:40 - can take your asking for help game at
01:42 - just a completely next level like after
01:44 - this tool i literally talked to so many
01:47 - of these services like i'm using from
01:49 - our website and if i get into some
01:51 - problems I'll be like hey what's going
01:53 - on man like I need help with something
01:54 - they'll help me instantly so let me show
01:56 - you now the tool i'm talking about is
01:58 - called drop ler it's spelled dr o PL r
02:03 - and essentially to screenshot tool so
02:07 - most of the times when I would take
02:08 - screenshots what would happen is that it
02:11 - would sit right here on my desktop
02:13 - my desktop looked so hideous over time
02:16 - because it just filled up every single
02:19 - space because I just take a lot of
02:21 - screenshots right and I want to share
02:22 - those screenshots and it was also taking
02:24 - up a lot of space on my computer so my
02:26 - computer was getting low on space this
02:29 - tool allows you to take screenshots
02:31 - without them actually being stored on
02:33 - your desktop it essentially gets stored
02:36 - right over here and also it saves the
02:39 - desktops for you those screenshots for
02:41 - you so you can come back and retrieve
02:43 - them at any time and it can also record
02:47 - videos for you and this is the crazy
02:50 - part because what's the normal process
02:53 - for recording a video and sending it to
02:55 - somebody you have to record the video on
02:57 - your computer using a specialized
02:59 - software once it's done recording you
03:01 - have to edit it or whatever and then you
03:03 - have to export it and you have to sit
03:04 - there while it exports and it just takes
03:07 - so much of your time and then you can
03:09 - share it with somebody else and so
03:10 - nobody does it from their desktop nobody
03:12 - wants to record a video and share it but
03:14 - what this tool does and let me just show
03:17 - you really quickly so for example let's
03:19 - say that I got this piece of code from a
03:22 - student and they needed help on this
03:24 - here's how I would give them feedback on
03:26 - it okay and I'm going to hit on my
03:28 - computer I'm on a Mac I'm gonna hit
03:30 - option shift five and i'm just going to
03:34 - drag like this part and let's just do
03:37 - this live so i'll hit start recording
03:39 - okay so now i'm actually recording this
03:43 - alright so i'm going to pretend that i'm
03:45 - recording this that video all right
03:48 - Brian your code looks pretty good to me
03:50 - list some is a function that accepts an
03:53 - input list of numbers and you
03:55 - essentially go through it and you
03:56 - increment it by a blah blah blah and
03:58 - then now you're calling your function
03:59 - passing eating passing in this list with
04:02 - 10 numbers in it everything looks good
04:05 - to me now I just ended it okay and I'm
04:08 - going to tell it to record it as a movie
04:11 - I think you guys were actually unable to
04:13 - see that part and what it did is it just
04:16 - added it to my clipboard and now look
04:19 - the video is done and I can actually
04:20 - watch it ok so now I'm actually
04:23 - recording this all right so I'm going to
04:25 - pretend I'm of course and i'll just post
04:27 - this video in the link to so you can see
04:29 - it so look at how easy that was and now
04:32 - it's actually just a shareable link and
04:34 - this is what the link is it's just that
04:36 - link so nothing got uploaded to my
04:39 - computer nothing I've saved on my
04:41 - computer and I'm essentially able to
04:43 - share this with anybody in the world so
04:45 - it really lets me speak my mind without
04:48 - having to write down all this crap that
04:50 - I don't want to hide down to be honest
04:52 - with you and it just lets me share
04:54 - instantly for screenshots what's super
04:58 - cool is like I can do option shift and
05:01 - three and like take a screenshot so like
05:04 - here's my screenshot and again it's not
05:06 - saved on my computer and it's very easy
05:08 - to annotate stuff so I do that I do this
05:11 - and I say uh your code looks good now
05:17 - like let's say I want to move it so I'll
05:19 - move it up here let's say there's
05:21 - something sensitive about this maybe
05:23 - your credit card is showing up in the
05:25 - video maybe your driver's license is
05:27 - showing up or I don't know your face is
05:31 - showing up and it just doesn't look good
05:32 - you want to hide it click this blower
05:34 - button and then just go like this and
05:36 - it's gone okay like this is rocket
05:41 - science to do in other softwares and
05:43 - it's just this easy here and that's why
05:46 - i love it because of how fast it is and
05:48 - what you can do is just hit upload so
05:50 - now again this is just a shareable link
05:52 - and this is what the link is and look
05:56 - here's a picture and i'll post this
05:57 - picture in the video description below
05:59 - to so you can just check it out this
06:01 - software exists for both mac and windows
06:04 - so if your windows for the first time in
06:07 - your life you don't get screwed and you
06:09 - get an awesome software and another
06:12 - thing is that um it's free if you're
06:14 - only taking 10 like screenshots or 10
06:17 - videos in a month and it stores up to
06:21 - one gigabyte of storage so that's a lot
06:23 - but and again it's HD videos you can
06:26 - even take animated gifs you can compose
06:29 - notes it shortens your URLs I mean it
06:32 - just has so many benefits but I have the
06:35 - ten dollars a month version
06:37 - and to be quite honest you should just
06:41 - get it because it takes your
06:42 - productivity to the next level and if
06:45 - you value your time think of it like you
06:48 - know the payoff of this and how much you
06:52 - use this you'll save hours and hours of
06:54 - your time and one good way i like to
06:56 - think about these things is like i'll
06:58 - think ok how much money do i make in an
07:00 - hour and if it saves me at least two
07:02 - hours am I making up for this right so
07:04 - like I don't know if you're working
07:05 - somewhere and you're making eight bucks
07:07 - or ten bucks an hour think of it like
07:09 - okay well let's save me one hour in a
07:13 - month and if it saves you that one hour
07:17 - then you can justify getting this and
07:19 - this is so useful that like don't have
07:23 - netflix and have this instead to be
07:25 - honest with you okay so that's the
07:27 - version I have the pro one and I don't
07:30 - know it's just awesome I want to share
07:32 - with you check it out if you don't like
