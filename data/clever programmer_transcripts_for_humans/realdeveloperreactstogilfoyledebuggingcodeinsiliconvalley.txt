With timestamps:

00:00 - fourteen billion nine hundred ninety
00:01 - nine million nine hundred ninety nine
00:02 - thousand nine hundred and ninety nine
00:04 - rust bucks and ninety nine rush cents
00:05 - code like the wind my lady okay that was
00:09 - not that funny
00:10 - i mean i don't really get it but ah
00:12 - let's get going
00:13 - yo what's up guys i was inspired and i
00:15 - thought how about if i make a video and
00:17 - in today's video
00:18 - we're actually going to be reacting to a
00:21 - scene from silicon valley where
00:23 - algel foil guilfoyle actually debugs
00:26 - code so we're going to jump into it
00:27 - let's see how it is i want you to go
00:29 - ahead smash that like button but right
00:31 - before we get into this video
00:32 - subscribe to the channel because this is
00:34 - the channel where you're going to be
00:35 - learning
00:36 - all things full stack development this
00:38 - is your boy and this is a
00:39 - developer react series let's get
00:42 - straight into it
00:44 - [Music]
00:51 - oh
00:54 - [Music]
00:55 - okay so apparently they're a bunch of
00:57 - developers they're working overnight
01:00 - they're sleeping here
01:01 - um and you know there's somewhat truth
01:03 - to this because as
01:05 - developers you kind of do crazy
01:06 - sometimes and
01:08 - it does feel like that where you're
01:09 - coding for so long that you ended up
01:11 - sleeping
01:12 - but realistically at your actual job
01:14 - that's not what you're gonna see okay
01:16 - bunch of people sleeping that's not
01:17 - really real but
01:18 - okay it's funny let's keep going
01:22 - my merry knights of piper sir owen doing
01:26 - valiant battle with the authentication
01:27 - service
01:28 - yes good yeah oh and prithee
01:31 - becky my queen i'll go with
01:35 - cashless payments russ's pricing keeps
01:37 - tripping us up
01:38 - okay how so well this morning he decided
01:40 - everyone at russ fest should be a
01:42 - billionaire
01:43 - so every dollar someone puts into their
01:44 - account will now be worth one billion
01:46 - rust bucks
01:47 - zwoons so what like a sandwich will be
01:51 - worth
01:52 - 15 billion rest bucks or something 14
01:54 - billion 999 million 999
01:57 - 999 rust bucks and 99 rush cents
02:00 - because he thought that would sound
02:01 - cheaper it's kind of screwing up the
02:03 - interface
02:04 - but the whole etnt deal is writing on
02:06 - this right
02:07 - we'll get there good okay excellent
02:10 - well uh code like the wind my lady
02:14 - okay that was not that funny i mean i
02:17 - don't really get it but
02:18 - ah let's get going oh good friar gabriel
02:21 - how does thou
02:22 - fare with the ticketing module
02:26 - it's gone what do you mean gone
02:30 - for some reason guilfoyle deleted the
02:32 - whole thing a few minutes ago what
02:34 - yeah okay that's really scary if you
02:36 - find out a developer just deleted
02:38 - something
02:38 - and you work with them or you were also
02:40 - working on that software and you walk in
02:42 - and they're just deleted the entire
02:44 - freaking repo
02:45 - or the code base is gone that's
02:47 - something to be stressed about foil yes
02:50 - richard i'm aware the drone dispatching
02:52 - code has been deleted and i'm working
02:53 - very hard to restore the right version
02:55 - whoa
02:56 - i love how deadpan he is you just told
02:58 - me that the ticketing module got deleted
03:00 - ticketing too so let's see what's going
03:02 - on so what it looks like
03:04 - is on the screens he has um
03:07 - so here i actually see he has the
03:09 - command line open
03:10 - uh on the left hand side it also looks
03:13 - like he has sublime text open
03:15 - on the right computer and there's like
03:17 - three sublime texts open i don't know
03:19 - why you would do that you would normally
03:20 - just have
03:21 - all the tabs open in one you know that
03:24 - gives it away
03:25 - you know i don't know just like a real
03:26 - developer situation going on because
03:28 - real developer
03:29 - i don't know that's i mean they get
03:30 - messy but uh most of the times that's
03:32 - not how you would do it but you know
03:34 - every developer is different
03:36 - and most developers just have their own
03:38 - setups and their own likings
03:40 -  that's problematic i'll get on that
03:42 - next what the is going on
03:45 - based on the amount of work left to do
03:47 - and the number of hours left before the
03:48 - festival i decided to task son of anton
03:50 - to use machine learning to debug some of
03:52 - our code
03:55 - okay that's so debugging is already a
03:59 - nightmare it's one of the hardest things
04:00 - you can do in coding to take that one
04:03 - step further
04:04 - and have to debug um
04:08 - write a machine learning algorithm that
04:10 - debugs that's essentially machine
04:12 - trying to debug your code good luck
04:15 - you're gonna have a lot of trouble
04:16 - figuring out what went wrong can wear
04:18 - you kidding me you gave your ai
04:21 - permission
04:21 - to overwrite code in the internal file
04:23 - system were you gonna tell me about this
04:25 - no i thought that was the company policy
04:29 - these days
04:29 - okay so another thing to get out of this
04:32 - he makes the code changes
04:34 - and he doesn't even actually inform
04:35 - anybody now something important as a
04:37 - developer you're going to be working on
04:39 - a team with people
04:40 - one of the worst things that so many
04:41 - developers tend to do
04:43 - is they lack communication and that
04:45 - makes them a developer like guilfoyle
04:46 - where they're really good at what they
04:48 - do
04:48 - and they have three freaking sublime
04:50 - texts open
04:51 - but nobody freaking likes working with
04:54 - them so what happens when you do that
04:56 - well whenever somebody gets a chance
04:58 - they're gonna try to fire you
05:00 - you get in a really bad situation so
05:02 - you'd rather be a developer that's not
05:04 - the best but you have
05:05 - excellent communication skills and
05:07 - teamworking skills because at the end of
05:09 - the day if you're going to build
05:10 - anything great
05:11 - you got to do it with the team well your
05:13 - ai
05:14 - just failed epically that's unclear
05:18 - it's possible that son of anton decided
05:20 - that the most efficient way to get rid
05:21 - of all the bugs
05:22 - was to get rid of all the software which
05:24 - is technically and
05:26 - statistically correct but artificial
05:28 - neural nets are sort of a black box so
05:30 - will
05:30 - artificial neural nets are a actual
05:32 - black box
05:33 - never know for sure so
05:36 - now we get into this situation and this
05:39 - is super interesting to talk about
05:41 - if you have a developer that does
05:42 - something like this where they think
05:44 - that they're intellectually superior
05:46 - than everybody else which is pretty much
05:47 - all a stack overflow
05:49 - but if you have a developer that kind of
05:50 - thinks like this you
05:52 - are in a really difficult situation
05:54 - because they're going to get defensive
05:56 - when you try to talk to them about
05:57 - something
05:58 - they feel like their software is their
05:59 - own and if and because they spend so
06:01 - much time writing that code and working
06:03 - with that software
06:04 - if you're saying the software is bad
06:07 - they really think you're saying
06:08 - they are bad as human beings and so
06:11 - separating the two is very difficult now
06:13 - one thing he could have done when he was
06:15 - talking to guilfoyle is
06:16 - made him less defensive and instead of
06:19 - talking to him in such a harsh way and
06:20 - going could you believe that your code
06:22 - did this and i can't believe you did
06:24 - that
06:24 - you could be like hey you're an
06:25 - excellent developer you crush it at this
06:27 - job you're fantastic
06:30 - but just this one thing that happened i
06:32 - think this might be causing problems
06:34 - that would have made guilfoyle a lot
06:36 - less defensive and open up more
06:38 - so this is a tip for if you're working
06:39 - on a software development team and you
06:41 - have a colleague
06:41 - that's how you should approach it and
06:43 - that's how you should speak with them
06:44 - did you
06:45 - order meet like a bunch of meat
06:48 - like 4 000 pounds of meat
06:53 - interesting i put son of anton on
06:56 - finding us cheap hamburgers for lunch
06:58 - it looks like the reward function was a
07:01 - little underspecified
07:02 - okay that's hilarious so basically what
07:04 - happened is basically he's writing this
07:06 - machine
07:07 - learning algorithm and i like how he has
07:09 - like github octa-cat on the left-hand
07:11 - side what's funny that's happening here
07:13 - he has a machine learning algorithm and
07:15 - now machine learning
07:16 - algorithm is designed to you know where
07:19 - things get more rewarded does more of
07:21 - those things when you get less rewards
07:22 - for something
07:23 - it does less of those things that's how
07:25 - artificial intelligence
07:26 - works okay so if you taught artificial
07:29 - intelligence machine
07:30 - hey you get rewarded for surviving
07:32 - longer and you get not rewarded for
07:34 - dying off earlier
07:35 - it'll try to survive longer okay or
07:37 - it'll try to eat more food or attack
07:39 - more people whatever you teach it to do
07:41 - so scary he made this uh
07:44 - algorithm this algorithm got out of
07:46 - control
07:47 - and it started report being rewarded
07:49 - really highly for ordering food
07:52 - so it went and like ordered freaking 4
07:54 - 000 or 10
07:55 - 000 pounds of meat instead of just a
07:57 - little bit of meat reward function was a
07:59 - little underspecified
08:00 - okay that's why he said the reward
08:02 - function was a little underspecified
08:04 - which is a good
08:05 - idea for you to write unit tests for
08:08 - your code before you do them but a lot
08:10 - of developers that think they're better
08:11 - than everybody else sometimes will not
08:12 - write unit tests
08:14 - and do things directly which causes
08:16 - problems so
08:17 - one tell that you're a senior developer
08:19 - and you're excellent at your job
08:20 - they do tons of testing senior
08:22 - developers do so much freaking testing
08:24 - it's crazy before this
08:26 - put things into production so don't put
08:28 - things into production
08:30 - before testing now on son of anton is
08:32 - banned
08:33 - just write code like a normal human
08:35 -  being please
08:37 - hey guilfoyle so i've been thinking
08:38 - about your ai and its
08:40 - many deficits i think son of anton's
08:43 - issue might be how it's handling reward
08:44 - uncertainty
08:45 - your issue man right that's the problem
08:47 - it's handling reward uncertainty in a
08:49 - poor way and so it's
08:51 - going crazy but again guilfoyle is
08:53 - getting defensive again
08:55 - the insecurity masked by false bravado
08:58 - and
08:58 - unisex cologne off it's not unisex
09:06 - oh man okay well that's all i had for
09:10 - you today guys
09:11 - you know if you want to become a
09:12 - developer and you want to learn more
09:14 - about this or if you enjoyed this video
09:16 - let me know this was the first of many
09:18 - developer react series i hope you
09:21 - enjoyed me reacting to silicon valley i
09:22 - hope it was entertaining
09:24 - you'll learn something and hopefully
09:25 - you're not going to order 10 000 pounds
09:27 - of meat with that said i love your
09:29 - beautiful face
09:30 - this is your boy kazzy and i'll see you
09:32 - in the next
09:34 - video
09:39 - [Music]

fourteen billion nine hundred ninety nine million nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine rust bucks and ninety nine rush cents code like the wind my lady okay that was not that funny i mean i don't really get it but ah let's get going yo what's up guys i was inspired and i thought how about if i make a video and in today's video we're actually going to be reacting to a scene

that's not really real but okay it's funny let's keep going my merry knights of piper sir owen doing valiant battle with the authentication service yes good yeah oh and prithee becky my queen i'll go with cashless payments russ's pricing keeps tripping us up okay how so well this morning he decided everyone at russ fest should be a billionaire so every dollar someone puts into their account will now be worth one billion rust bucks zwoons so what like a sandwich will be worth 15 billion rest bucks or something 14 billion 999 million 999 999 rust bucks and 99 rush cents because he thought that

all i had for you today guys you know if you want to become a developer and you want to learn more about this or if you enjoyed this video let me know this was the first of many developer react series i hope you enjoyed me reacting to silicon valley i hope it was entertaining you'll learn something and hopefully you're not going to order 10 000 pounds of meat with that said i love your beautiful
