01:29 - man how to code we're gonna code a
01:31 - really short program
01:32 - um and we'll just see how it goes what
01:34 - do you know about coding and development
01:36 - do you know anything about it
01:37 - nothing you never you know tried coding
01:39 - or anything in your past
01:41 - never okay have you used a smartphone
01:43 - something like that
01:44 - yeah those those are made out of code
01:47 - right so
01:47 - everything that is in the smartphone
01:49 - pretty much was made from people that
01:51 - code
01:51 - yes like every piece of technology has
01:53 - like code running on it
01:55 - so we're gonna put up an app together
01:56 - okay sure all right awesome dude
01:58 - okay so so we're going to code up a
02:00 - really really simple application i'm
02:02 - going to have you do all the typing all
02:03 - right i'll hold the laptop and you can
02:04 - type it
02:05 - so first thing i want you to do is i

02:09 - the word print and hit delete and then
02:12 - p-r-i-n-t
02:14 - r-i-n-t and then an open and open
02:16 - calling
02:18 - uh you gotta hit the shift key so hit
02:20 - delete it's all right bro right so hit
02:23 - that
02:23 - nice and then hold the shift key and
02:25 - then hit the nine
02:26 - there you go and now you wanna put a
02:29 - quotation mark okay so put hold the
02:30 - shift key
02:31 - and this button again all right awesome
02:34 - now just pick a phrase
02:36 - a phrase huh yeah what do you want to
02:38 - say

02:44 - it so this dot means it hasn't saved it
02:46 - we have unsaved changes
02:47 - i want you to hold command and hit s for
02:50 - save so command s
02:52 - sic okay so now it's saved alright so we
02:54 - actually this is what this is a one line
02:55 - of code
02:56 - what i want you to do is i want you to
02:58 - use the trackpad here and click on this
03:00 - green
03:01 - um thing here we're actually going to
03:02 - run your code okay so what this is gonna
03:03 - do is
03:04 - this is gonna print what you said to the
03:06 - screen which
03:07 - it came out right there okay so it says
03:09 - print how are you
03:10 - and that's what you said so if we

03:13 - change
03:14 - all right okay awesome okay let's let's
03:17 - keep going so i have a little
03:18 - a little apple i want you to build i

04:06 - final app so let's run it one more time
04:08 - and we'll see it in action down there at
04:09 - the bottom
04:10 - right let's run the code yep all right

04:39 - new you know never done this before
04:42 - you're coding man like you're literally
04:44 - coding like people who work at big
04:45 - companies and stuff they they know how
04:46 - to code
04:47 - and this is what they do on a day-to-day
04:48 - basis and they they help create apps for
04:50 - people like on the phones or on laptops
04:53 - so it's gonna be harder or easier
04:57 - i didn't think i don't know didn't think
05:00 - didn't think much of it just didn't know
