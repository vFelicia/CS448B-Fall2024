With timestamps:

00:00 - I have completely stopped using
00:02 - environment variables and envy files if
00:06 - I go ahead and empty out this whole
00:08 - environment file in fact if I remove
00:12 - this environment file completely from my
00:16 - reactjs project even though I am using
00:20 - process. EnV for API keys and many other
00:24 - things if I restart my nextjs server
00:28 - right here and if I look at the project
00:32 - and refresh my browser my local host in
00:37 - fact the app still fully works I've got
00:40 - all my boards I can go into and arrow
00:42 - all the boards I can pretty much use the
00:45 - whole project everything works login log
00:47 - out so Nas how the heck does this work
00:50 - how is it that you have removed the
00:52 - environment file you're using process.
00:55 - IV and everything still works that's
00:58 - because we have found the different tool
01:01 - we were sick of creating environment
01:04 - variables we were sick of sharing them
01:07 - with developers hoping they would go
01:10 - would not go into the wrong hands we
01:12 - were sick of updating environment
01:14 - variables across the whole team because
01:17 - if you update you have to let everybody
01:19 - know that you updated the environment
01:22 - variables we were sick of managing all
01:25 - of that and it was such a nasty
01:28 - experience so found this tool that
01:30 - changed everything it completely removed
01:33 - the necessity for you to keep track of
01:36 - these environment variable environment
01:38 - variables it completely removed the need
01:41 - for you to remember to add them it
01:44 - removed the need for you to keep them
01:47 - updated across the whole development
01:49 - team and it even removed the need for
01:53 - developers to see them so I want to show
01:56 - you this tool because I think it can
01:58 - really help you
02:00 - the piece of software I'm about to show
02:02 - you is not sponsored this is just an
02:06 - application that we love to use Kazi
02:08 - actually found this and that we've used
02:11 - on our team to build poppy AI it just
02:14 - has helped us so much and it's so simple
02:16 - to use as well and so let me show you
02:20 - what it is so it's called in physical
02:24 - it's an open- Source secret management
02:28 - and it's all one platforms to secure
02:30 - manage applications blah blah blah right
02:33 - again very very simple to understand in
02:36 - terms of what it actually does what it
02:38 - does really well is just being able to
02:42 - save all of your keys your client
02:45 - secrets and sync them up between
02:48 - different environments and sync them up
02:50 - between different developers so if you
02:52 - add a new environment key then it will
02:55 - get synced up across all developers like
02:57 - how sick is that and so I'm making this
03:00 - video because I just genuinely want to
03:02 - help developers out there on the fact
03:05 - that there are better ways of doing this
03:08 - instead of creating your EnV files and
03:11 - doing it that way um now granted your
03:13 - EnV files might still be good if you're
03:15 - just one person doing this but if you
03:16 - have a development team then there's no
03:19 - reason for you to do this to to actually
03:21 - create those AMV files so like it's so
03:23 - easy if you look at this if I zoom in
03:24 - here oh let me see here let me if I zoom
03:26 - in like look at this you just do a
03:28 - physical run inv Dev and like and then
03:30 - do npm run dab and it will insert all
03:33 - the keys directly for you and it's as
03:36 - simple as that we have it so simply done
03:40 - I think let me go and actually sign up
03:42 - for our let me go and sign in into our
03:44 - application we have our Pop I one here
03:47 - and we have all these different keys
03:49 - that we get to use as you can see and
03:53 - you can actually click into it and
03:55 - you'll be able to see the keys right
03:56 - here you can edit the keys um change
03:59 - them which environment they are part of
04:02 - and then go from there and then sync
04:05 - them up as well with like versel um I
04:08 - believe they also have a bunch of
04:10 - Integrations like AWS um Azure BB bucket
04:13 - Circle CI uh
04:16 - checkley G I mean GitHub Heroku uh
04:20 - gitlab netlify so so many different
04:24 - Frameworks that they have are working
04:26 - with and with versel it's also super
04:28 - super easy like you see there's versel
04:30 - right here right with versell it's super
04:33 - super easy uh hopefully I can show you
04:35 - guys how versell even works settings
04:38 - maybe Integrations here right so we've
04:41 - got the physical integrated into there
04:42 - and this will literally sync all the
04:44 - keys automatically so if we add a key to
04:47 - physical it will be added directly into
04:49 - here of course you have to restart then
04:51 - probably the project but it'll be fully
04:53 - added into here which is so cool and
04:57 - then let me show you how this works on
04:59 - the actual application side of things so
05:03 - I have this thing where we use open API
05:05 - key we even use Gemini Keys here correct
05:08 - and so let me go ahead and stop running
05:10 - the application here contrl C boom boom
05:13 - I do mpm run Dev and mpm run Dev as you
05:17 - can see if we make this a little bit
05:18 - larger what it does is that it does in
05:22 - physical run next Dev which inserts the
05:24 - keys into the environment all of them
05:28 - and then see if in injecting 16 in
05:31 - physical secrets into your application
05:33 - process and that's it and like you don't
05:36 - have to worry about creating any
05:38 - environment variables none of that it
05:40 - just inserts it for
05:42 - you how sick is
05:44 - that I'm just blown away by how good
05:47 - this application is Kazi I give this
05:49 - credit to Kazi because he's the one who
05:50 - found this um but just not having to
05:55 - share this with other developers and
05:57 - then if you add new keys then you don't
05:59 - you don't have have to share that with
06:00 - our developers it just get automatically
06:02 - gets synced throughout everybody we
06:05 - finally have a [ __ ] solution and I
06:07 - don't know why it took so long so long
06:09 - to actually make it happen but yeah so
06:12 - yeah for new developers who are just
06:14 - starting out then yeah create
06:16 - environment variable Keys you know you
06:18 - don't have to use in physical for
06:20 - example but for people who are have a
06:24 - development team they're working on the
06:25 - project and there's a few developers on
06:28 - the project that definitely use it using
06:31 - physical um again not sponsor in any
06:34 - shape or
06:35 - form I wish we
06:38 - were I just think they're a great
06:40 - product and I want you guys to use it I
06:44 - want you guys to make it easier for
06:47 - yourselves hence why I'm making this
06:50 - video and of course this video is
06:53 - sponsored however by us which is by our
06:56 - product called poy aai so we have been
06:59 - building a product that using a physical
07:01 - the product called pop AI we're pretty
07:02 - much what we're building is is a
07:06 - whiteboard on steroids is what we call
07:08 - this it's a way to help other
07:11 - people learn create 10 times faster with
07:16 - AI right so that's the goal it's like
07:18 - the biggest thing is that we have our
07:21 - customers using this is talking to
07:22 - YouTube videos so I can imagine you can
07:24 - bring a bunch of YouTube videos from
07:26 - different sources and then you can
07:28 - simply talk to them and ask questions
07:29 - and get deep insights within seconds you
07:32 - don't have to watch a bunch of podcasts
07:34 - you don't have to watch the video 10
07:36 - minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes you get
07:37 - instant answers and then from there you
07:40 - can actually create insights and then
07:42 - from there you can create so much for
07:43 - more in terms of emails newsletters you
07:46 - name it but the biggest thing is just
07:48 - being able to learn 10 times faster so
07:51 - like for example for example like here
07:53 - as you can see I've used it for so many
07:56 - different things for example we're
07:57 - currently outreaching to a bunch of
07:58 - influencers on promoting poy Ai and so
08:02 - first I got a way got a way to learn how
08:05 - to use um how to reach out to
08:08 - influencers I took videos from Alex
08:10 - trosi from what this is another another
08:14 - person they had a ton of views took them
08:16 - in started to ask a bunch of questions
08:18 - about how to apply that to our videos or
08:22 - sorry to our uh product and then boom
08:24 - and then I saved that on here which is
08:26 - like hey it told me to create a list of
08:27 - 100 influencers in this my specific
08:29 - Niche send personalized messages Etc but
08:32 - I can go much more deeper than just this
08:34 - right then I took screenshots which is
08:37 - so cool I took screenshots of all the
08:39 - influencers that I have been looking and
08:40 - finding and the cool thing is these
08:42 - screenshots have links to these
08:44 - influencers right because it's their
08:46 - YouTube screenshots and then what I can
08:48 - do is so sick I can connect them and
08:52 - then I can ask very deep questions
08:53 - around like
08:55 - this let me zoom in here
08:58 - boo for example like give me all the
09:01 - YouTube channels right give me a nice
09:03 - bullet point list of of the name so give
09:05 - me give me me all the
09:10 - influencers influencers
09:14 - from um give me all the influence give
09:17 - me all the influencers with links and
09:22 - subscriber count and their
09:25 - industry boom
09:30 - there it is and these links go directly
09:32 - to the YouTube channel which is so cool
09:34 - so I don't have to save these guys
09:35 - anywhere on Goog Google Sheets at any
09:39 - point in time if they're all just right
09:41 - here and that can be like hey create
09:44 - Outreach
09:46 - messages for the F uh to the first
09:50 - two
09:51 - first
09:53 - two uh
09:55 - people
09:58 - around to ask to see if we can collab
10:05 - together on promoting poppy AI now of
10:08 - course you can probably get a lot
10:10 - smarter with the message right this is
10:13 - just an
10:15 - example there it is boom right hi Andrew
10:20 - blah blah
10:23 - blah like sick right amazing and and
10:28 - then make sure sure to mention their
10:32 - YouTube channel and even a YouTube
10:36 - video video that we liked and how their
10:43 - channel can help um falls falls in line
10:50 - with promoting poppy
10:53 - AI
10:56 - boom and so the cool thing is that even
10:59 - knows the videos too following YouTube
11:02 - channel blah blah and I currently
11:03 - impressed with your content Especial the
11:05 - video PhD like you see like it knows the
11:07 - content like how sick is that so same
11:10 - thing here use to write perfect essays
11:13 - like this is awesome I love this tool oh
11:16 - my God I get to use this every [ __ ]
11:18 - day um this is just an example but yeah
11:21 - just a few examples of how we use our
11:23 - own tool which is funny um let's see
11:28 - what else yeah we this is this is just
11:30 - for testing we had but I also use this
11:33 - for example
11:35 - like right use this for example to get
11:38 - key insights um from a YouTube video
11:40 - from a website that I wanted to learn
11:43 - from and then here for example I was
11:45 - talking about the number one rule um for
11:50 - copyrighting and I wanted to create an
11:52 - email right and then I use this and I
11:55 - added my voice and as a result I was
11:57 - able to create an email just like this
11:59 - this based on the copyright and rules of
12:02 - Alex trosi insane so but then but you
12:07 - can go even further because like you
12:09 - know I use this a lot for for example
12:13 - for learning like when I was thirr on my
12:16 - diet I imported a bunch of people's
12:18 - YouTube videos about diet and then I had
12:22 - and then I imported my body scan body my
12:24 - dexa scan and then I asked hey you know
12:27 - here's how I was feeling the past few
12:29 - days and I said I've been dieting for
12:31 - the past 5 months I lost 10 pounds and I
12:32 - have a crazy diet fatigue I want to eat
12:34 - constantly based on that info from Dr
12:36 - Mike for
12:38 - example let me go ahead and make this do
12:41 - not disturb so you don't see this there
12:43 - we go it told me exactly what to do
12:45 - based like your M device your current
12:47 - situation you might may benefit from a
12:49 - diet reset here's a brief outline of the
12:51 - next steps Etc so this is what we have
12:54 - been working on and physical was a way
12:57 - of actually showing that um if you're
12:59 - interested right now we have a very cool
13:03 - offer down below um with a 3-day trial
13:07 - so go ahead and check it out um the
13:10 - price will go up as well and yeah we're
13:15 - just excited for you to try it out give
13:17 - us feedback we're constantly getting
13:19 - feedback from customers we're constantly

13:22 - we're super excited on how we can make
13:25 - this even better thank you so much for
13:27 - watching I hope you enjoyed this video
13:29 - video I hope you actually took a lot
13:31 - from it especially even in the
13:32 - environment variables part because I
13:34 - personally just like I hate all of that
13:39 - um and so in physical has helped me a
13:41 - lot again not sponsored in any shape or
13:43 - form um but yeah thank you so much have
13:46 - a good day I'll see you later bye

Cleaned transcript:

I have completely stopped using environment variables and envy files if I go ahead and empty out this whole environment file in fact if I remove this environment file completely from my reactjs project even though I am using process. EnV for API keys and many other things if I restart my nextjs server right here and if I look at the project and refresh my browser my local host in fact the app still fully works I've got all my boards I can go into and arrow all the boards I can pretty much use the whole project everything works login log out so Nas how the heck does this work how is it that you have removed the environment file you're using process. IV and everything still works that's because we have found the different tool we were sick of creating environment variables we were sick of sharing them with developers hoping they would go would not go into the wrong hands we were sick of updating environment variables across the whole team because if you update you have to let everybody know that you updated the environment variables we were sick of managing all of that and it was such a nasty experience so found this tool that changed everything it completely removed the necessity for you to keep track of these environment variable environment variables it completely removed the need for you to remember to add them it removed the need for you to keep them updated across the whole development team and it even removed the need for developers to see them so I want to show you this tool because I think it can really help you the piece of software I'm about to show you is not sponsored this is just an application that we love to use Kazi actually found this and that we've used on our team to build poppy AI it just has helped us so much and it's so simple to use as well and so let me show you what it is so it's called in physical it's an open Source secret management and it's all one platforms to secure manage applications blah blah blah right again very very simple to understand in terms of what it actually does what it does really well is just being able to save all of your keys your client secrets and sync them up between different environments and sync them up between different developers so if you add a new environment key then it will get synced up across all developers like how sick is that and so I'm making this video because I just genuinely want to help developers out there on the fact that there are better ways of doing this instead of creating your EnV files and doing it that way um now granted your EnV files might still be good if you're just one person doing this but if you have a

and actually sign up for our let me go and sign in into our application we have our Pop I one here and we have all these different keys that we get to use as you can see and you can actually click into it and you'll be able to see the keys right here you can edit the keys um change them which environment they are part of and then go from there and then sync them up as well with like versel um I believe they also have a bunch of Integrations like AWS um Azure BB bucket Circle CI uh checkley G I mean GitHub Heroku uh gitlab netlify so so many different Frameworks that they have are working with and with versel it's also super super easy like you see there's versel right here right with versell it's super super easy uh hopefully I can show you guys how versell even works settings maybe

to these influencers right because it's their YouTube screenshots and then what I can do is so sick I can connect them and then I can ask very deep questions around like this let me zoom in here boo for example like give me all the YouTube channels right give me a nice bullet point list of of the name so give me give me me all the influencers influencers from um give me all the influence give me all the influencers with links and subscriber count and their industry boom there it is and these links go directly to the YouTube channel which is so cool so I don't have to save these guys anywhere on Goog Google Sheets at any point in time if they're all just right here and that can be like hey create Outreach messages for the F uh to the first two first two uh people around to ask to see if we can collab together on promoting poppy AI now of course you can probably get a lot smarter with the message right this is just an example there it is boom right hi Andrew blah blah blah like sick right amazing and and then make sure sure to mention their YouTube channel and even a YouTube video video that we liked and how their channel can help um falls falls in line with promoting poppy AI boom and so the cool thing is that even knows the videos too following YouTube channel blah blah and I currently impressed with your content Especial the video PhD like you see like it knows the content like how sick is that so same thing here use to write perfect essays like this is awesome I love this tool oh my God I get to use this every [ __ ] day um this is just an example but yeah just
