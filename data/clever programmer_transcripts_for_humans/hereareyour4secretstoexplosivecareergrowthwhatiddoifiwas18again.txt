00:23 - recorded but if you're on my snapchat or
00:25 - Instagram you get to see this live while

00:54 - everywhere else because on YouTube
00:55 - actually give you that perfect finished
00:57 - edited product everything cut out and
01:00 - pretty whereas on Instagram you get to
01:02 - see the messy lifestyle of a developer
01:04 - and you know the kind of lifestyle that
01:06 - I was able to form you know such as
01:08 - traveling around different cities
01:10 - different states hopefully I'll be going
01:12 - to new countries pretty soon and you
01:15 - know you get to see that lifestyle you
01:16 - get to embrace it and you know again
01:18 - what I say is more is caught than taught
01:20 - so if you just saw on my youtube or my
01:22 - you know my coding channels and stuff
01:24 - like that yes I will teach you a lot but
01:27 - if you're on my Instagram you will get
01:29 - you know it's like you'll catch a lot of
01:31 - these things and these habits will kind
01:33 - of rub off on you and become your normal
01:34 - habits so that's my shameless plug for
01:38 - my Instagram channel but what I want to
01:40 - do is now get this video started and
01:42 - this video is gonna be about what's the
01:44 - heck what I do if I was 18 again I am 23
01:47 - right now okay
01:48 - so without any further ado let's jump
01:50 - right into it
02:01 - [Applause]
02:04 - so if I was 18 again right what I would
02:08 - do is I would start creating content on
02:10 - YouTube I would start blogging as soon
02:12 - as possible and I would try to make as
02:15 - many friends as possible okay because
02:18 - you want to start learning social skills
02:21 - as fast as possible and you want to
02:23 - leave your mark on the world
02:25 - if you don't contribute if you don't
02:27 - create if you don't produce if you don't
02:29 - provide value to the world it's almost
02:32 - like you don't even exist okay so kind
02:35 - of think of it like that like if you
02:36 - don't have social media presence you're
02:38 -  dead okay I know it sounds harsh
02:42 - and I love you but it's kind of true so
02:45 - by having that presence people who there
02:49 - are a lot of people who will watch your
02:51 - videos and get magnetized to you and
02:53 - want to work with you and you'll be
02:54 - getting job offers and freelance offers
02:56 - without you even actually trying okay so
02:59 - here's what I mean do you have to be an
03:01 - expert to start producing content
03:03 - absolutely not
03:05 - okay you can start producing content on
03:07 - anything that you're learning right this
03:09 - second okay so if you're learning coding
03:10 - you're learning social studies you're
03:12 - learning whatever whatever interests you
03:14 - right this moment including things like
03:16 - what book you're reading right now okay
03:17 - if you start creating content on it one
03:20 - you're teaching it and if you teach
03:22 - something its immense knowledge right it
03:24 - makes it more real and materializes in
03:26 - your head and you become a master of it
03:30 - okay - you're providing value to other
03:32 - people okay so if you are want to do it
03:34 - for altruistic purposes you can but if
03:36 - you're not that nice guy and you just
03:39 - want to do it for yourself I'll tell you
03:40 - some more valuable things that you get
03:41 - out of it okay so number three it's
03:43 - other people finding your work okay
03:46 - you'll find other like-minded people
03:48 - that you can connect to it throughout
03:49 - the world even if your family doesn't
03:51 - understand you even if your friends
03:52 - doesn't understand don't understand you
03:54 - you can create your own network of
03:55 - people to study with to learn from to
03:58 - travel with that beautiful stuff it hold
04:01 - each other accountable number four
04:02 - you'll get job offers you'll get
04:04 - freelance offers and imagine you go into
04:07 - an interview and there are multiple
04:08 - candidates for that job which
04:10 - candidate do you think they'll choose do
04:12 - you think they'll choose the candidate
04:13 - who just went through like the regular
04:15 - motions of society such as went to
04:17 - college and got a degree for that job
04:19 - and that's all the passion he has for
04:21 - that programming job or do you think
04:23 - they'll pick somebody who's blogging
04:25 - about it
04:25 - who's networking with other people about
04:27 - it who's creating YouTube content about
04:29 - it you know who's passionate about this
04:31 - stuff
04:31 - and has has produced knowledge and
04:35 - wealth to the world right so this will
04:38 - differentiate you and position you as an
04:41 - expert even if you're not even if you're
04:43 - just two three months in right this will
04:45 - allow you to put your foot in the door
04:46 - and let's say you don't get that senior
04:48 - level developer job you can get that
04:50 - junior love level developer job or that
04:52 - intern level developer job so if I was
04:54 - 18 again I would start creating stop
04:57 - procrastinating stop consuming stop
05:00 - envying stop lingering stop thinking and
05:03 - I would start doing I would start
