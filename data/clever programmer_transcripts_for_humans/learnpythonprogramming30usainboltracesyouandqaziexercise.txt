00:00 - hey guys what's up this is Kazi from
00:02 - clever programmer calm and we are going
00:05 - to be building working our way up to
00:08 - tic-tac-toe so this is going to be one
00:12 - problem that I'm going to give you
00:13 - before I put you guys on to tic-tac-toe
00:16 - project because once you do this you'll
00:18 - have a better idea of how to complete
00:20 - that project okay so this is going to be
00:24 - a pretty important video and after this
00:26 - you guys will be ready to write your own
00:27 - very own first game and what I have done
00:30 - for you guys is essentially it's not
00:32 - just going to be a boring text-based
00:33 - game I've created a full GUI for you
00:36 - guys so once you complete the code and
00:38 - complete the functions the whole GUI
00:40 - application but will work all right so
00:44 - without any further ado let's get
00:45 - started on the helper assignment I
00:47 - created for you guys so this assignment
00:49 - is called Usain Bolt races you and Kazi
00:54 - okay so here's the backstory Usain Bolt
01:00 - you and Kazi had a race okay
01:04 - surprisingly Usain Bolt won
01:07 - I don't know why and then you came in
01:10 - second and for some reason cos just
01:12 - sucks at running so I suck at running
01:13 - somehow and I came in third so I didn't
01:16 - do too good all right now can you write
01:19 - a function that given a person's name
01:23 - returns their place so for example if I
01:25 - gave you Usain Bolt's place already
01:27 - Sainz name so I just said you saying you
01:30 - give me back
01:31 - zeroth place or sorry first place if I
01:35 - gave you like if I type in you or mean
01:40 - in your case I would have you write me
01:42 - okay so like here if you see the test
01:44 - case so if I give you me then you should
01:47 - return second place and if you put in
01:51 - Kazi it should give you three all right
01:54 - that's how your function should work and
01:57 - can you also write a function that does
02:00 - the opposite given a place it returns
02:03 - their name so maybe your phone so your
02:06 - function will be called number two
02:07 - choice and if I give you one you should
02:09 - give me back Usain and if I give you two
02:12 - you should give me
02:12 - back me when you're writing and typing
02:15 - this code me will really be you right
02:17 - and if you give the function number two
02:21 - choice three it should return toddies
02:24 - name okay so my name if it works then
02:29 - you get back a nice little graphical
02:32 - gooey thing that I made for you guys
02:34 - you'll have a turtle they'll make a nice
02:36 - little circle and say good job okay my
02:38 - graphics are getting next level okay so
02:42 - give this function a try see if you can
02:45 - solve it see if you can solve a choice
02:48 - to number and number two choice okay
02:51 - those are your two functions so
02:52 - essentially if I give you you here then
02:56 - you should say okay that's first play a
02:59 - second place if I give you you saying
03:01 - here you should return okay that's first
03:03 - place and here if I give you two you
03:07 - should return your name or sorry not
03:10 - your name but you and I'm sorry I'm
03:14 - confusing you guys it should return me
03:16 - if I gave you two this function should
03:18 - return me okay you can look at the test
03:20 - cases and that's what they say
03:22 - this whole mean using is kind of
03:24 - confusing but if I give you three it
03:26 - should return Kazi all right number so
03:30 - I'll leave that there
03:31 - so in this I've already written the
03:34 - function name for you and I've already
03:35 - written the argument names for you to
03:37 - make your life easy alright what you
03:39 - have to do is complete both of these
03:41 - functions and then go at the bottom and
03:44 - uncomment this line if I uncomment it
03:47 - right now and try to run it you can see
03:49 - it says incorrect keep trying if I run
03:52 - it again I'll say incorrect do not give
03:55 - up which means that my code is incorrect
03:57 - all right once my code is correct it's
03:59 - going to make a nice little green circle
04:01 - and say correct good job so if you've
04:04 - not given a try yet go give it a try
04:08 - otherwise I'm going to go over the
04:11 - solution right now okay so let's get
04:13 - started so how will we write the choice
04:17 - to number choice function all right so
04:21 - let's let's write it up if choice is
04:24 - equal to
04:26 - - you saying then return 1 else if
04:34 - choice is equal to cos e or sorry me
04:40 - return to else return or let's let's
04:44 - actually just do else if choice is equal
04:47 - to cos e return 3 ok so that will
04:54 - essentially do what we want if I try to
04:56 - print here and go print choice to number
05:00 - and give it cos e right let's see what
05:05 - it does
05:06 - just run it you can see that it gave us
05:09 - back 3 that's exactly what we expected
05:11 - because I came in third
05:13 - now what if I gave it me which is going
05:15 - to be you and you're writing this
05:16 - function it's going to say - ok that's
05:19 - exactly what you want and let's say we
05:21 - give it you saying it says 1 ok so it's
05:27 - working correctly that's exactly what we
05:29 - want but is there an easier way we can
05:31 - do this function so there's if else if
05:34 - and else if that we wrote is there a way
05:36 - we can make it easier perhaps using
05:38 - dictionaries that we learned earlier
05:41 - remember we have choice and that's
05:44 - associated with or sorry we have this
05:47 - thing here and each choice associated
05:49 - with the value over the number so this
05:53 - should automatically be telling you guys
05:55 - like hey maybe there's a key value
05:57 - relationship if you put in one you get
05:59 - back you saying if you're if you put in
06:01 - you say and you get back 1 if you put in
06:03 - me you get back - if you put in cos you
06:05 - get back 3 so what we can essentially do
06:07 - is rip this whole thing down and replace
06:10 - it with the data structure that is that
06:14 - that does it for us right it's called a
06:17 - dictionary so I'm just gonna say our
06:22 - choices what should I call it let's call
06:27 - it race dictionary for now okay to keep
06:30 - things simple and I'm gonna say if given
06:33 - you saying
06:37 - I'm going to write it on actually let's
06:40 - just keep it simple given you saying
06:42 - return key you're saying should be the
06:45 - key and the value should be one me key
06:51 - is me value is 2 and then Kazi key is
06:56 - Kazi and what is the value value is 3 so
07:01 - then we can say return race underscore
07:04 - dictionary and we can index it by the
07:07 - choice that's given to us so for example
07:10 - if you put in you saying here it's going
07:15 - to look through this dictionary right
07:17 - what's the way that dictionaries work
07:19 - its dictionary you index it by its key
07:25 - and then it returns the corresponding
07:27 - value so here race dick is the
07:31 - dictionary we index it by the choice so
07:34 - if the user gives us you saying I'll put
07:37 - a new sign here and I'll return this
07:39 - whole thing we'll evaluate to the value
07:42 - so in this case 1 same thing will happen
07:44 - but the rest of them okay so hopefully
07:48 - that makes sense and can we simplify
07:50 - this yes we can do we really need a
07:52 - variable that we're just going to use
07:53 - like a second later
07:56 - not really um and it doesn't make our
08:00 - code any dirtier or any harder to read
08:02 - so in this case you can just do this and
08:04 - it's done you can assign it a name if
08:07 - the dictionary was really big but here
08:09 - the dictionary is pretty small we don't
08:10 - need to use an extra variable here so I
08:14 - think this is good and let's use the
08:16 - same idea here and we can say return if
08:20 - given one return you saying oh by the
08:22 - way let's let's test it ok that's that's
08:24 - a good thing to do let's let's run this
08:29 - here by hitting run and let's see what
08:32 - we get and we get back one that's what
08:34 - we expected let's put in me here let's
08:36 - see what happens and we get back to what
08:39 - happens here we pass in me to the choice
08:41 - to number function so you really pass in
08:44 - me like this it goes in the it
08:49 - indexes this dictionary by me right and
08:53 - me has a value of two so this whole
08:56 - thing evaluates the two and it's done
08:59 - okay let's hit it run and it returns two
09:03 - so it's working and let's do the same
09:06 - thing for a number two choice return
09:07 - oops
09:08 - earn two would return me and then three
09:21 - should return Kazi right and we index it
09:27 - by the number because this time number
09:28 - is the key okay so okay it looks good to
09:34 - me let's uncomment the line 67 and see
09:38 - after it does it pass all these tests
09:40 - I've written here right does it
09:42 - give in the same return one given one
09:45 - return the scene and all that let's run
09:47 - it and it passes all the test cases and
09:50 - on the right-hand side you see it made a
09:51 - nice little green circle with the turtle
09:54 - said good job and so we are done okay
10:00 - awesome if you guys didn't get it the no
10:04 - worries if the dictionary thing was new
10:06 - to you perfect this is all supposed to
10:09 - be new for you guys now these concepts
10:12 - are going to be directly applied in the
10:14 - next video where I'm going to have to
10:15 - take Tac Toe project for you guys I have
10:19 - the notes for it I have the solution
10:20 - guide for it and I will help you guys
10:23 - build the whole thing on your own and
10:25 - it'll be something that you can proudly
10:27 - share with your friends family whoever
10:30 - okay your girlfriend/boyfriend doesn't
10:33 - matter it's going to be something that's
10:35 - going to actually work it's going to
10:37 - have a link that you can share and it
10:38 - will directly be playable so I hope you
10:40 - guys are excited for the next video and
10:42 - I'll see you guys there

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys what's up this is Kazi from clever programmer calm and we are going to be building working our way up to tictactoe so this is going to be one problem that I'm going to give you before I put you guys on to tictactoe project because once you do this you'll have a better idea of how to complete that project okay so this is going to be a pretty important video and after this you guys will be ready to write your own very own first game and what I have done for you guys is essentially it's not just going to be a boring textbased game I've created a full GUI for you guys so once you complete the code and complete the functions the whole GUI application but will work all right so without any further ado let's get started on the helper assignment I created for you guys so this assignment is called Usain Bolt races you and Kazi okay so here's the backstory Usain Bolt you and Kazi had a race okay surprisingly Usain Bolt won I don't know why and then you came in second and for some reason cos just sucks at running so I suck at running somehow and I came in third so I didn't do too good all right now can you write a function that given a person's name returns their place so for example if I gave you Usain Bolt's place already Sainz name so I just said you saying you give me back zeroth place or sorry first place if I gave you like if I type in you or mean in your case I would have you write me okay so like here if you see the test case so if I give you me then you should return second place and if you put in Kazi it should give you three all right that's how your function should work and can you also write a function that does the opposite given a place it returns their name so maybe your phone so your function will be called number two choice and if I give you one you should give me back Usain and if I give you two you should give me back me when you're writing and typing this code me will really be you right and if you give the function number two choice three it should return toddies name okay so my name if it works then you get back a nice little graphical gooey thing that I made for you guys you'll have a turtle they'll make a nice little circle and say good job okay my graphics are getting next level okay so give this function a try see if you can solve it see if you can solve a choice to number and number two choice okay those are your two functions so essentially if I give you you here then you should say okay that's first play a second place if I give you you saying here you should return okay that's first place and here if I give you two you should return your name or sorry not your name but you and I'm sorry I'm confusing you guys it should return me if I gave you two this function should return me okay you can look at the test cases and that's what they say this whole mean using is kind of confusing but if I give you three it should return Kazi all right number so I'll leave that there so in this I've already written the function name for you and I've already written the argument names for you to make your life easy alright what you have to do is complete both of these functions and then go at the bottom and uncomment this line if I uncomment it right now and try to run it you can see it says incorrect keep trying if I run it again I'll say incorrect do not give up which means that my code is incorrect all right once my code is correct it's going to make a nice little green circle and say correct good job so if you've not given a try yet go give it a try otherwise I'm going to go over the solution right now okay so let's get started so how will we write the choice to number choice function all right so let's let's write it up if choice is equal to you saying then return 1 else if choice is equal to cos e or sorry me return to else return or let's let's actually just do else if choice is equal to cos e return 3 ok so that will essentially do what we want if I try to print here and go print choice to number and give it cos e right let's see what it does just run it you can see that it gave us back 3 that's exactly what we expected because I came in third now what if I gave it me which is going to be you and you're writing this function it's going to say ok that's exactly what you want and let's say we give it you saying it says 1 ok so it's working correctly that's exactly what we want but is there an easier way we can do this function so there's if else if and else if that we wrote is there a way we can make it easier perhaps using dictionaries that we learned earlier remember we have choice and that's associated with or sorry we have this thing here and each choice associated with the value over the number so this should automatically be telling you guys like hey maybe there's a key value relationship if you put in one you get back you saying if you're if you put in you say and you get back 1 if you put in me you get back if you put in cos you get back 3 so what we can essentially do is rip this whole thing down and replace it with the data structure that is that that does it for us right it's called a dictionary so I'm just gonna say our choices what should I call it let's call it race dictionary for now okay to keep things simple and I'm gonna say if given you saying I'm going to write it on actually let's just keep it simple given you saying return key you're saying should be the key and the value should be one me key is me value is 2 and then Kazi key is Kazi and what is the value value is 3 so then we can say return race underscore dictionary and we can index it by the choice that's given to us so for example if you put in you saying here it's going to look through this dictionary right what's the way that dictionaries work its dictionary you index it by its key and then it returns the corresponding value so here race dick is the dictionary we index it by the choice so if the user gives us you saying I'll put a new sign here and I'll return this whole thing we'll evaluate to the value so in this case 1 same thing will happen but the rest of them okay so hopefully that makes sense and can we simplify this yes we can do we really need a

it a name if the dictionary was really big but here the dictionary is pretty small we don't need to use an extra variable here so I think this is good and let's use the same idea here and we can say return if given one return you saying oh by the way let's let's test it ok that's that's a good thing to do let's let's run this here by hitting run and let's see what we get and we get back one that's what we expected let's put in me here let's see what happens and we get back to what happens here we pass in me to the choice to number function so you really pass in me like this it goes in the it indexes this dictionary by me right and me has a value of two so this whole thing evaluates the two and it's done okay let's hit it run and it returns two so it's working and let's do the same thing for a number two choice return oops earn two would return me and then three should return Kazi right and we index it by the number because this time number is the key okay so okay it looks good to me let's uncomment the line 67 and see after it does it pass all these tests I've written here right does it give in the same return one given one return the scene and all that let's run it and it passes all the test cases and on the righthand side you see it made a nice little green circle with the turtle said good job and so we are done okay awesome if you guys didn't get it the no worries if the dictionary thing was new to you perfect this is all supposed to be new for you guys now these concepts are going to be directly applied in the next video where I'm going to have to take Tac Toe project for you guys I have the notes for it I have the solution guide for it and I will help you guys build the whole thing on your own and it'll be something that you can proudly share with your friends family whoever okay your girlfriend/boyfriend doesn't matter it's going to be something that's going to actually work it's going to have a link that you can share and it will directly be playable so I hope you guys are excited for the next video and I'll see you guys there
