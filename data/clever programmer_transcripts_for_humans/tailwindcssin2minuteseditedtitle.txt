00:00 - tailwind css is a new upcoming css
00:02 - framework that allows developers to
00:05 - create their own unique designs unlike
00:08 - other css frameworks like bootstrap
00:10 - tailwind does not come with predefined
00:12 - components like buttons or cards instead
00:14 - it comes with predefined css classes
00:17 - like size color typography shadows
00:20 - padding to allow you to create those
00:23 - cards by yourself so for example if you
00:25 - want to specify the width of a div all
00:27 - you have to say is w dash and the width
00:31 - that you want for that div to specify
00:33 - color you can use classes like bj dash
00:36 - red or bg dash yellow or bg dash green
00:38 - even when setting shadows you can use
00:40 - classes like shadow dash sam for a small
00:42 - shadow or shadow dash lg for a large
00:45 - shadow one of the best features included
00:47 - in tail and css is the hover and focus
00:50 - states for example inside the api
00:52 - integration we can see that on the hover
00:54 - state we have a bg light blue applied
00:57 - for the a tag on the item title for the
01:00 - group hover we are specifying a text
01:02 - white and on the item category we are
01:04 - specifying a group hover to change to
01:07 - text light blue 200. to create a booster
01:10 - button we specify the class btn and
01:13 - btn-primary
01:15 - and that gives us the blue submit button
01:17 - that you see right here now until when
01:19 - css we will add the class bj dash blue
01:21 - for the background color hover b
01:24 - dashboard to change the hover state text
01:26 - white for the white text font bold to
01:28 - make it bold py2 for padding vertically
01:31 - px4 for padding horizontally and rounded
01:34 - for rounded corners the key with
01:36 - tailwind here is flexibility for example
01:39 - if you want to make this button green
01:41 - boom it's done if you want to make this
01:43 - button bigger voila and done or maybe
01:45 - you just want to add a box shadow and
01:47 - just like that it's there so should you
01:49 - learn it well if you're a complete
01:51 - beginner tailwind is not a good option
01:54 - for you because every css class and
01:56 - tailwind is like applying an individual
01:57 - css property but you need to understand
01:59 - css at its core before moving on to a
02:02 - framework like this but if you're
