12:28 - question daniel what makes a 65
12:30 - developer
12:30 - well there's lots of things but it's
12:32 - gonna boil down to just a few things
12:34 - right
12:35 - because when we're trying to become the
12:37 - six figure developer
12:38 - we have that goal and we set it out in
12:40 - front of us so that we can hit it
12:41 - you're going to want to work on specific
12:43 - skill sets whether technical or soft
12:45 - skills
12:46 - and you're going to want to develop
12:47 - yourself as a person to be able to get
12:50 - to that point of being a six figure
12:51 - developer yes yes yes so
12:53 - guys let's let's check it out so hello i
12:55 - like money i mean of course everybody
12:57 - likes money crusher crab
12:58 - loves money very much okay who doesn't
13:00 - love money you know we always say a lot
13:01 - mine does not make us happy and at some
13:03 - points it does but not having mine does
13:05 - not make us happy either so
13:06 - so you have to be careful with that
13:08 - exactly so as you do want to
13:10 - make more money you need to make sure
13:12 - you have that
13:13 - roadmap right you want to make sure that
13:16 - you have the goal set up in front of you
13:17 - the right one so that you could work
13:19 - closer and closer
13:20 - to achieving it day and day again and
13:23 - that's why
13:24 - nas is going to break down his
13:25 - experience so you can have that road map
13:27 - and then we're going to just dive deep
13:29 - into becoming six figures guys very
13:31 - important that's going to smash that
13:33 - like button for the youtube algorithm
13:35 - as you know we have done an amazing job
13:37 - i would say so
13:38 - the past four days as the day five so i
13:41 - would appreciate that if you guys just
13:42 - smash it
13:43 - if you just go ahead and share this
13:44 - video with everybody else just again the
13:46 - more people
13:46 - the more people view it the more people
13:48 - know about it the better that way we get
13:49 - to share the knowledge that we currently
13:51 - have with the more people again
13:52 - let's go ahead and get to 200 likes we
13:54 - are currently at 147
13:56 - i never get 200 really quickly all right

15:50 - like holy [ __ ] how to do this so fast
15:52 - and then what i do is i end up taking a
15:55 - machine learning course a machine
15:56 - learning course
15:57 - of course because i apply machine i have
16:00 - found out that i can apply machine
16:02 - learning to their problem
16:04 - and what i did is i basically created
16:06 - machine learning
16:07 - algorithm that predicted how many leads
16:12 - they'll get in the next few years wow
16:15 - that is huge like
16:16 - prediction like predicting leads and
16:18 - when they saw that they're like holy
16:20 - [ __ ] you know everybody else is kind of
16:23 - doing the projects that they've been
16:24 - told to do
16:25 - i went outside the box and there's
16:26 - something different and that was blew
16:29 - their mind and the other day
16:31 - i got a chance to talk with their head
16:32 - machine learning uh machine learning
16:34 - guy and after he saw this go talk with
16:38 - him
16:38 - he offered the job to beat his team
16:41 - right away
16:42 - like because he loved the the intention
16:44 - so far and then that's when i got
16:46 - offered the 65
16:47 - k right here right here that's what
16:49 - happens when you just offer value
16:51 - right when you bring value to the table
16:52 - when you build your skill sets when you
16:54 - learn new things that are applicable
16:56 - to the job to adding value to a business
16:59 - or company yes you get these amazing
17:00 - offers yes
17:01 - and the crazy thing is again this was
17:04 - i didn't even finish college like
17:06 - college is not the reason why i'm here
17:08 - because it's not the reason why i got
17:09 - this or why i got this
17:11 - but the reason why i got this is because
17:12 - i was very proactive
17:14 - i was very bold like being bold is big
17:17 - guys being bold
17:19 - is very big okay and being able to be
17:22 - risky
17:22 - and be risky with what you want to do
17:24 - and being [ __ ] like
17:26 - being so damn on the line in terms of
17:29 - what you want to do in your life
17:31 - okay that's the most important thing if
17:33 - you just kind of stand around waiting
17:34 - for things to happen they won't happen
17:35 - i'm sorry
17:36 - but if you be bold and if you go towards
17:39 - it like a bowl
17:40 - that's when change gets created okay
17:42 - awesome let's move on
17:43 - there's another company this is uh
17:45 - actually i had
17:47 - did not go with this company when they
17:48 - offered me this money because this other
17:50 - company offered me this money
17:52 - so by the way and again this was a
17:55 - one-day interview and they love what i
17:56 - end up doing and they offer me uh this
17:58 - is again college is not even finished
18:00 - yet so they offered me 70k right after
18:02 - that so that was really cool
18:03 - uh again this is a company after when i
18:06 - just started doing freelancing i worked
18:07 - for com with the company called
18:08 - approved me when i did freelancing that
18:10 - was a lot of fun i got to build
18:12 - one of the biggest react.js projects
18:14 - this whole project was in react.js pro
18:16 - wow and it had millions of millions of
18:18 - lines of code
18:19 - millions of lines of code it was in thai
18:22 - script react gs
18:23 - redux all the stuff you guys learned
18:25 - here
18:26 - learned here this is teaching from like
18:29 - our
18:30 - our knowledge from our real world
18:33 - experience to you
18:34 - right this is real word world stuff i'm
18:36 - not kidding i'm not kidding okay

18:41 - friends is still working with them but
18:42 - of course i'm not because i'm
18:43 - so focused with you guys okay awesome so

18:51 - thousand five thousand dollars
18:52 - oh just so you know these guys paid
18:54 - around twenty thousand dollars
18:56 - but that's only for about a month and a
18:58 - half so
18:59 - so that was pretty good you know that
19:01 - was pretty good so
19:02 - um uh discovered me another project do
19:05 - they pay 5k
19:06 - not for the design but they paid 5k
19:09 - honestly
19:10 - just for a software requirements
19:13 - document which by the way is something
19:14 - we teach how to do
19:15 - in profit javascript again you will have
19:17 - the early bird price
19:19 - on sunday so make sure you go there okay
19:21 - but they literally just paid me for a
19:22 - requirements document for 5k
19:24 - just to build this like to put build
19:25 - requirements out can you believe that
19:26 - bro that is huge that's insane that's
19:28 - crazy yeah
19:29 - so and so like like like i know you're
19:31 - like like yes you did all this stuff but
19:33 - how did you do it now it's like
19:34 - how did they happen well it didn't
19:37 - happen overnight and
19:38 - didn't happen easy and it was not easy
19:40 - and it took a lot of sweat and tears
19:41 - okay but
19:42 - how did it happen it's a good question
19:44 - well so again this is me you guys know
19:46 - um just a regular guy just like you are
19:48 - you guys are
19:49 - but i'm very i love my work and i'm very
19:52 - hard working that's the one thing that i
19:53 - can tell about myself okay
19:55 - um yeah i gotta get a chance to
19:57 - interview companies like google khan
19:58 - academy squarespace this is a lot of fun
20:00 - these guys actually flew me out to
20:01 - california for free
20:03 - they gave me a really nice hotel and uh
20:05 - paid for everything pretty much that was
20:06 - a lot of fun
20:07 - safety with valentin another great
20:08 - company again flew me out to california
20:10 - literally the hotel pro apparently was
20:12 - 500 per night and i didn't pay for
20:13 - anything
20:14 - nice that was insane that's amazing that
20:15 - was a lot of fun yeah and i got a chance
20:17 - to interview all these companies
20:19 - and so yeah that's kind of about me uh
20:20 - what i end up doing is when i started
20:22 - guys
20:23 - um the process was really cool because i
20:25 - started
20:26 - i realized that college was no good
20:29 - unfortunately
20:30 - college college college college will not
20:34 - not will not get you to get you
20:37 - the real real world experience i'm
20:40 - saying just college i'm not saying
20:42 - college is
20:42 - uh unnecessary i'm not saying any of
20:44 - those things um
20:45 - i'm not get you the real world
20:48 - experience
20:50 - periods i know i have a horrible typing
20:52 - that's okay though
20:53 - uh um experience hold on here's
20:56 - a great coder trust me experience right
20:58 - there he has a lot of typos he's a great
21:00 - character
21:00 - right so the way i kind of found that
21:02 - out is because i was learning a lot of
21:04 - theory as i'm sure you know too right
21:07 - like you learn a lot of theories well in
21:08 - college correct
21:09 - yep and how did you how do you think
21:10 - that kind of helped you out tell me like
21:12 - do you think that something
21:13 - will really push you in in the real
21:16 - world tell me
21:17 - i mean most of what really helped me was
21:19 - what i did on the side which were like
21:20 - the practical
21:22 - uh projects that i would build right the
21:24 - mobile applications or the web
21:25 - applications
21:26 - yes correct and and so and so what did
21:28 - you realize with
21:30 - with theory in terms of what else do you
21:32 - need besides theory tell me
21:34 - what do you mean by that is anything
21:36 - else you realize that you need did you
21:38 - realize that you need anything something
21:39 - else besides theory tell me
21:41 - um you need practical application you
21:44 - build skills you need to build
21:45 - portfolios right you build projects that
21:47 - are going to be able to help you
21:49 - to get to where you want to go again
21:50 - correct at the end of the day it's about
21:52 - having the skill of being able to build
21:54 - an amazing project by yourself right i'm
21:57 - figuring it out by yourself now i don't
21:58 - mean you have to code every single line
22:00 - i don't mean you have to memorize what
22:02 - every single line of code the function
22:04 - not so if you could use google and
22:05 - youtube to help you out
22:07 - you're going to be able to solve a
22:09 - problem not just
22:10 - memorize lines of codes and write them
22:12 - for your tests and homework assignments
22:14 - correct so guys do this so
22:15 - uh i kind of and so what i end up doing
22:17 - is i actually end up going ahead and
22:18 - joining a startup company right here
22:20 - this is called uh trendella it's really
22:22 - fun
22:22 - these guys are amazing they're still one
22:24 - of my user friends steve here he just
22:25 - got married which is insane
22:27 - steve congrats uh now she's yeah so
22:30 - another one of my friends case and this
22:32 - is me as you guys can see this is
22:34 - robert this guy is doing amazing he's
22:35 - working the company right now he's used
22:36 - epic stuff
22:37 - in terms of coding he loves it but
22:40 - together as four people
22:41 - like we were working on this app that
22:43 - was basically bringing
22:44 - clothing together into one application
22:46 - from all these different applications
22:48 - and i'll show you how exactly how it
22:49 - looks like but i came up to them and
22:51 - said hey guys
22:52 - i'm ready to work for free i'm ready to
22:54 - work for free because i just want the
22:55 - experience

22:58 - get me there and so like you know what
22:59 - let's do it
23:00 - they give me a task to do which is to
23:02 - build a python scraper
23:03 - and granted i literally went home and i
23:05 - i you know what i you know what i typed
23:07 - into google what'd you type i tell you
23:08 - what is python
23:10 - what is it literally that's the first
23:12 - thing i type like what is python because
23:13 - they told me to the python script like
23:14 - what the [ __ ] is python you know what i
23:16 - mean
23:16 - so uh at that point kind of what
23:18 - happened is
23:19 - i was like okay great so i found out
23:21 - what python is i found out how to do
23:22 - scraping and i end up doing
23:23 - business creeper and they brought me on
23:25 - to work with them i work with them for
23:27 - about a year for free completely
23:28 - but that year is what changed my whole
23:30 - life it's the reason why i'm here today

27:09 - don't write this kind of stuff down
27:10 - it's not going to be helpful for you at

27:14 - so how much income do you want to make
27:15 - per month in the comments below right
27:17 - now guys
27:18 - how much income do you want to make per
27:19 - month let us know right now okay
27:22 - three thousand don't be like oh crazy
27:23 - i'm like i wanna make a million per
27:24 - month right now
27:26 - okay let's be real realistic okay let's
27:28 - not let's actually be your list in terms
27:30 - of what you want to make and what that
27:31 - will cover right now
27:32 - so you can go like grow your career as a
27:34 - developer yeah i mean
27:36 - you could build up to the million later
27:38 - after you build a cool business but you
27:40 - need to build some skills first so first
27:42 - let's get you to those milestones that
27:44 - are gonna be
27:45 - in your realm of doing within this next
27:47 - year 2021.
27:49 - so let's say let's say this for example
27:50 - everybody's saying like 3k 5k 5k
27:52 - that's not bad so 5k that's really
27:54 - reasonable one guy said 100k per month
27:56 - okay that's not unreasonable
27:57 - i mean if you're a complete pro you're
27:59 - building your sas company like you have
28:01 - all these crazy skills
28:03 - yes you could do that but if you're not
28:04 - there then
28:06 - so five keep a month how much is that
28:07 - per year six sixty thousand that's 60k
28:10 - per year
28:10 - that was not bad but would you say that
28:13 - for a beginner completely
28:15 - that's amazing that's amazing for a
28:16 - complete beginner bro that is an amazing
28:19 - salary guys most people cannot like most
28:21 - people are
28:22 - it's really hard for them to make that
28:23 - kind of money you know what i mean
28:24 - because you also have to keep in mind
28:25 - this is just your first year starting
28:27 - off
28:28 - entry level after that it's just going
28:30 - to skyrocket as you get better
28:32 - as you learn more skills as you
28:34 - understand what you have to do there's
28:36 - probably going to be raises are going to
28:37 - happen
28:37 - you can move to better companies they're
28:38 - going to pay you way more than what
28:40 - you're what they're currently paying
28:41 - exactly okay so now that you know like
28:43 - your 5k per month okay let's now let's
28:45 - talk about expenses okay
28:46 - what are your personal expenses how much
28:48 - how many expenses do you have
28:50 - right now okay that because your course
28:52 - you need to cover your expenses is very
28:53 - important okay you cannot just be on to
28:55 - your expense if you're under your
28:56 - expenses then you're losing money
28:58 - that's not good okay so what are your
29:00 - expenses for example let's let's how
29:02 - much expenses let's just have an example
29:03 - okay
29:04 - let's just say maybe it's 2k per month
29:06 - how about that maybe it's 2k per month
29:08 - maybe this is includes for example rent
29:10 - maybe it might include for example some
29:11 - food and so forth does it include a
29:13 - tesla
29:14 - bro i mean these are not my expenses
29:17 - [Laughter]
29:20 - these are not my expenses all right my
29:23 - sizes are this there's a little bit more
29:26 - but let's just say uh you know for a
29:27 - person how many expenses would you say
29:29 - okay how about this let's just say
29:31 - fine 3k how about that two keep a month
29:33 - okay yeah i think if maybe you have a
29:35 - family
29:35 - this is something that might be and
29:37 - you're living below your means you're
29:38 - not spending like crazy
29:39 - that sounds about right yeah so what
29:42 - identify what it means for you to be
29:43 - rich okay
29:44 - what does it mean for you to be happy
29:46 - with yourself right
29:48 - because because guys it's not just about
29:50 - money
29:51 - money great it will get you what you
29:52 - want you can go on vacation you can you
29:55 - know
29:55 - spend money for yourself for your family
29:57 - for other members of the family
29:59 - that's always the best part right but
30:01 - what makes you feel
30:02 - welcome and so the way i see it is like
30:04 - if it means for you to be rich is like
30:06 - okay at least maybe you have maybe let's
30:08 - say
30:09 - a thousand you can save per month or two
30:10 - thousand you can save a month would you
30:11 - say that's like
30:12 - let's say maybe say a thousand per month
30:14 - is kind of like a good goal would you
30:15 - say that that sounds good great just
30:17 - just like
30:17 - savings okay so save a thousand 1k
30:21 - 1k per month and keep in mind make sense
30:25 - okay cool
30:26 - 10 specific reasons why you need to make
30:28 - more money income
30:30 - exactly because you need to understand
30:32 - your why because once you understand
30:33 - your expenses
30:35 - once you identify what your rich is
30:37 - whether it's going to be just
30:38 - money whether it's going to be time
30:40 - freedom right you want to be just
30:41 - working
30:42 - 20 hours a week or you're going to want
30:43 - remote work at a full-time job with
30:45 - amazing benefits whatever that is
30:47 - next you need to know is your why so
30:49 - that's why you say write 10 specific
30:50 - reasons because 10 is going to challenge
30:52 - you a bit
30:52 - it's going to be a little bit hard but
30:53 - if you could sit down and write down 1
30:55 - through 10
30:56 - and write a specific reason as to why
30:59 - you want these things it's going to
31:00 - solidify
31:01 - in your head and your purpose and you're
31:03 - gonna have a fuel
31:04 - to get you there correct maybe for
31:06 - example you want freedom right maybe you
31:08 - want to be challenged okay
31:09 - maybe you want to be for example you
31:11 - want to have more time for family right
31:12 - so maybe more time for family
31:14 - time for family maybe you want amazing
31:16 - benefits that big tech companies give
31:18 - out yeah maybe
31:19 - you want amazing benefits who know
31:21 - amazing benefits
31:22 - maybe you just want to work with an
31:23 - amazing team right maybe you just want
31:24 - to love people
31:25 - yeah work with amazing people right with
31:27 - busy people all these are
31:29 - are great reasons for why you want to
31:30 - make more income right
31:32 - amazing people because like it or not
31:35 - if you're going to make more income
31:36 - you're going to be working with amazing
31:37 - people probably like that's honestly
31:39 - that simple right if you're gonna be
31:42 - more in my income
31:43 - those people are also going towards your
31:45 - goal they're also working just as hard
31:46 - as you are
31:47 - right so they're most likely have the
31:49 - same driving goals as you do right so
31:52 - always consider that okay cool
31:53 - so we got that portion now let's ask the
31:55 - question would you in that case
31:57 - freelance or would you full time
32:00 - what do you think like what what do you
32:01 - what what did you select i mean
32:03 - it's really going to be depending on
32:05 - anyone's personal preference right
32:07 - because
32:07 - we we talked about this in day one we
32:09 - want to talk about the opportunity
32:10 - and we broke down the pros and cons of
32:13 - freelancing the pros and cons of
32:15 - full-time
32:15 - and it's not exhaustive but again we
32:17 - just want to give you guys
32:19 - that perspective so that you could
32:21 - choose for yourself so i think in the
32:22 - end it's about that self-awareness of
32:24 - what you actually want
32:25 - yeah so let's talk about a little bit of
32:27 - uh benefits of freelancing will benefit
32:29 - from
32:30 - full-time let's show you that okay let's
32:31 - do that right now okay so
32:33 - okay just a few things let's do
32:35 - freelancing right now so freelancing
32:36 - benefits what are some
32:37 - benefits of freelancer tell me so
32:40 - freelancing
32:40 - flexibility on your hours that i think
32:43 - that's a big one that people like
32:45 - billion hours okay what else um
32:48 - you get to choose your clients get to
32:51 - choose your clients that's a
32:54 - positive and you get to choose your
32:56 - clients so a little more context right
32:58 - it's positive because if you do have a
32:59 - lot of clients coming to you you kind of
33:01 - get to choose the ones you're more
33:02 - excited about
33:03 - right and it would be a negative because
33:05 - you have to go figure out how to get
33:07 - your clients
33:08 - right you have to develop some marketing
33:09 - skills you have to develop some selling
33:11 - skills to be able to sell your services
33:12 - to clients
33:13 - that is correct yes okay up next what
33:15 - else is a positive
33:17 - um freelancing let's see man i would say
33:19 - income wise there's a lot of room for
33:21 - growth a lot of room for growth that's
33:22 - true a lot of room for growth
33:25 - you're only limited by how much you want
33:27 - to work right if you want to work
33:28 - less time then obviously you're not
33:30 - going to be making like
33:31 - hundreds and hundreds of thousands of
33:33 - dollars right yes but you do give
33:34 - yourself
33:35 - more time during the week but on the
33:37 - contrary guys because of
33:39 - there's a lot of room to growth when you
33:41 - first start out you're going to be
33:42 - making
33:43 - bad [ __ ] money i'm not gonna lie like
33:46 - you're gonna be making very little money
33:47 - initially as you started out because you
33:48 - don't have any
33:49 - any clients right now and you have zero
33:51 - trust that's the big issue you have zero
33:53 - trust right now you see what i mean
33:54 - but as you build those up it'll start to
33:56 - snowball over time
33:58 - right so that if you're going as
33:59 - freelancer for a couple years you'll
34:01 - have more clients you'll have more
34:02 - portfolios they'll show
34:03 - your work and people are going to want
34:05 - to work with you people are going to be
34:06 - talking about you through referrals
34:08 - and could build up your client base like
34:10 - that little by little but it is
34:12 - a long-term process that's not easy but
34:14 - you can do it yeah
34:15 - now how about full-time full-time well
34:17 - if you have a nice uh
34:19 - if you work at a big tech company you're
34:20 - probably surrounded or what are you
34:22 - gonna put that your paycheck
34:24 - uh yeah you could do steady paycheck
34:25 - yeah your paycheck nice benefits all the
34:27 - cool stuff that those give you right
34:29 - yesterday paycheck amazing benefits
34:31 - right i think the cool thing is amazing
34:32 - people
34:33 - right because yeah if you work at google
34:35 - you can be next to amazing software
34:37 - engineers they're going to be sitting
34:38 - right next to you
34:39 - right yes you're going to get to learn
34:41 - from them you're going to get to work
34:42 - with them
34:43 - and they're going to be the ones that
34:44 - get to review your coding you're going
34:45 - to get to review their coding your
34:47 - skills are just going to
34:48 - blast off after yeah so you get to have
34:50 - many mentors right because
34:51 - as a freelancer you're kind of working
34:53 - more so by yourself that's the issue
34:54 - right
34:55 - you're kind of there you know it's more
34:57 - by yourself you have to figure it out
34:59 - you have to be
35:00 - the man you have to be the project
35:02 - manager
35:03 - project manager the client manager the
35:06 - developer you've got like 10 different
35:08 - hats right
35:09 - um while with a photo you kind of get to
35:11 - focus a little more
35:13 - right in your case just being a
35:15 - developer and that's kind of for some
35:16 - for a lot of people that's a big benefit
35:18 - huge benefit right they don't want to
35:19 - focus on all these different things
35:21 - right
35:22 - they just want to focus on one thing
35:23 - which is becoming a developer and
35:25 - learning the most skills
35:26 - exactly and that's what comes down to
35:28 - you being self-aware of what
35:30 - you want to do and what will make you
35:32 - happy when you're working yes correct so
35:34 - let us know in the comments below guys
35:35 - what do you think you want to be
35:38 - freelance or full-time or even both yeah
35:41 - here's the thing i did both i did both
35:44 - right i did both right there's nothing
35:46 - wrong with doing that i
35:47 - actually i started out yes i did start
35:50 - out initially with
35:51 - i started out with full time correct i
35:53 - tried that i liked it
35:55 - there are some things that i didn't like
35:56 - but and i want to try freelancing
35:58 - and then i went to freelancing it's as
35:59 - simple as that guys that's pretty much
36:01 - it right
36:02 - as you develop the skill you're gonna
36:03 - have more options on what you want to do
36:06 - yes exactly and as i said guys you will
36:08 - be able to go ahead
36:10 - as you keep going you will be able to
36:11 - yourself figure out okay what do i do
36:13 - what do i watch right um what do i learn
36:16 - and so forth
36:17 - and you just be able to kind of you know
36:19 - pave your own path
36:20 - if your own path okay cool awesome
36:22 - moving on
36:23 - so let's break it down let's break it
36:25 - down guys what i need you to do
36:26 - right now is go to the next slide now is
36:29 - dance okay nevermind no
36:30 - no not not yet we'll dance later forget
36:32 - about everything we just talked about
36:33 - forget
36:34 - about your goals because those are nice
36:36 - those are amazing those can fuel you
36:38 - but what you need to do is you need to
36:39 - make sure you focus on the process
36:41 - and you're doing the small steps that
36:43 - are going to take you and get you closer
36:45 - to there because it's nice to think
36:47 - about the 5k a month yeah it's nice to
36:49 - think about the tesla
36:51 - on your driveway but if you're thinking
36:53 - about those things you're not going to
36:54 - enjoy the process and the steps that you
36:56 - have to do
36:57 - to be able to get there correct yes the
36:59 - process is always one of the most
37:01 - important things
37:02 - and just enjoying what you do like you
37:03 - know do you enjoy what you do i enjoy
37:05 - what i do
37:06 - do i enjoy what i do definitely nas
37:08 - enjoys what i love what i do
37:09 - i get to teach you guys and we get to
37:11 - dance and we get to dance
37:12 - like it's the best job in the world you
37:14 - know what i mean ever
37:16 - and so that came first before anything
37:18 - else and that
37:19 - is what brought everything else exactly
37:21 - so let's break this process down
37:23 - for you guys what are the five stages of
37:25 - making a hundred thousand dollars a year
37:27 - nas
37:27 - so your first stage is earning what your
37:31 - first what
37:31 - your first ten to a hundred dollars so
37:34 - how might this come about
37:35 - that might tell me well there's
37:36 - different ways but first if you get to
37:38 - this point
37:39 - congratulations yes because this is huge
37:41 - people downplayed but this is so
37:43 - cool like someone paid you 10. you just
37:45 - did it ten dollars for what for your
37:48 - knowledge
37:50 - so way that this is possible especially
37:52 - if you're starting off
37:54 - is through tutoring right because when
37:56 - you're tutoring
37:57 - you don't have to become a full master
37:59 - of javascript or whatever it is that
38:01 - you're going to tutor you just have to
38:02 - be two steps ahead of the person
38:04 - and someone would be willing to pay for
38:05 - an hour of your time correct to be able
38:07 - to get to that
38:07 - by the way guys really quick if somebody
38:09 - is asking when will we announce the
38:10 - winners most likely we'll announce the
38:12 - winners on sunday so make sure you
38:14 - are there in the webinar guys really
38:16 - important case click the link below
38:18 - the description for the webinar that's
38:19 - when we will announce the winners okay
38:21 - really really really important okay so
38:23 - stay tuned for that cool
38:24 - awesome all right let's go ahead and
38:26 - keep going all right so next thing after
38:27 - you've done that what else is next tell
38:29 - me
38:29 - now you're gonna try to bump that up and
38:31 - try to get to your first thousand
38:33 - dollars
38:33 - per month yes right now again i do also
38:36 - want to add the caveat
38:37 - we're gonna dive deeper into probably
38:39 - more of the freelancing route in this
38:41 - case
38:41 - because if you do go the job route it
38:43 - would take a different path but we're
38:44 - also going to dive
38:45 - deep into that once we talk about the
38:47 - freelancing path so make sure you're
38:48 - paying attention to this
38:49 - right then once you get to 1000 you're
38:51 - maybe potentially looking at five to ten
38:53 - thousand dollars per month
38:54 - which is that is you're ready that's it
38:56 - you're in a career path you're growing
38:58 - you are pretty probably very happy with
39:00 - what you're making and you're just
39:02 - loving what you do
39:03 - and you're loving use the money that you
39:04 - have exactly and then now being
39:06 - consistent step four is you're able to
39:08 - do that for a whole year
39:09 - so that you make that 5k per year
39:12 - and then step five is you just build on
39:14 - those skills investing yourself
39:16 - invest in mentors go to conferences and
39:18 - get to the hundred thousand dollars per
39:20 - year correct
39:21 - correct correct okay let's go and focus
39:22 - that that camera right there
39:25 - beautiful thank you
39:29 - all right it's fine okay cool awesome so
39:32 - guys you can see the breakdown is pretty
39:34 - simple right right here right
39:35 - just i mean i know it's it's kind of
39:36 - like simple it's like what the heck i
39:38 - mean
39:38 - but let's go a little bit deeper okay so
39:40 - when you go ahead and start
39:42 - out with kind of um you know learning
39:45 - right there's we like to call this the
39:47 - pyramid of wealth right
39:48 - the modern javascript developer pyramid
39:51 - of
39:51 - wealth it's a simple simple process that
39:54 - you can just simply follow
39:56 - and well let's check it out so initially
39:58 - when you start out what's going to
40:00 - happen daniel
40:01 - when you start out you just have to
40:03 - learn the right skill sets you have to
40:05 - pick out something start learning at it
40:07 - start to master those things or start
40:09 - the process of mastering those things
40:11 - it's probably going to suck a little bit
40:12 - but that's how you start with everything
40:14 - right of course you have to suck a
40:16 - little bit initially
40:18 - to learn we all sucked yeah we all did
40:20 - too yeah i did not know how to write an
40:22 - html tag
40:23 - yeah you know i mean i didn't even know
40:25 - what ram was on the computer when i
40:27 - first started i didn't know what a
40:28 - semicolon was
40:29 - perfect you know what i mean so you kind
40:31 - of you can start out with that awesome
40:32 - so
40:32 - initially of course guys you have to
40:34 - start out with just simply learning so
40:35 - you learn
40:36 - what you need to learn right knowledge
40:39 - is one of the most valuable things you
40:40 - can have
40:41 - yo
40:45 - victor diaz just dropped a 20
40:48 - donation victory thank you so much man
40:51 - he says
40:52 - my total respect for you giving all the
40:54 - wisdom away for free you guys rock thank
40:56 - you victor
40:57 - you rock man thank you so much thank you
40:59 - everyone who supports and loves this
41:01 - community
41:02 - yeah you guys are amazing whoa thank you
41:05 - i mean that's what's a semicolon
41:08 - don't worry that was knowledge when he
41:09 - started too awesome all right let's keep
41:11 - going guys
41:12 - cool so that was part one right it's
41:15 - always learned right that's that's part
41:16 - one you wanna always get the skills
41:17 - first
41:18 - once you get the skills then you
41:19 - potentially coach right so you can coach
41:21 - other people at this point now
41:22 - now as a coach what can you expect to be
41:25 - coaching
41:25 - tell me you're probably going to want to
41:27 - coach what you just
41:28 - learned right so as you dove into
41:31 - javascript
41:32 - then you're going to want to teach
41:33 - people how to start to use javascript
41:36 - how do they write a function how do they
41:37 - make a class how do they do anything
41:39 - right right and so the thing is the
41:41 - really cool part about this is that you
41:42 - can actually coach
41:43 - others you don't have to be a pro with
41:45 - your coach you see what i mean so like
41:46 - for example if you think about this
41:48 - right
41:48 - let's say this is a timeline and let's
41:50 - say this right here is one
41:52 - two three four and so on these are
41:54 - levels like this is one level one
41:56 - level two level three level four right
41:59 - and when you start out guys you start
42:00 - out where you start out with this level
42:01 - right here
42:02 - level one okay yes sir level one this is
42:05 - you you know
42:06 - the zip nada you're learning how to make
42:09 - a variable
42:10 - zip like you know nothing right level
42:12 - two maybe you know
42:14 - basics right so you know
42:17 - basics at some point right that's basics
42:19 - well check this out because you're here
42:20 - level two
42:21 - who do you think could teach now at this
42:22 - point tell me you could teach the people
42:24 - in the levels under you so people in
42:26 - level one exactly you're suitable to
42:28 - help them out to get
42:30 - to where you're at which is level
42:31 - exactly guys we literally have students
42:32 - who want this
42:33 - through this reaction challenge they
42:35 - apply the same techniques we told them
42:36 - here
42:37 - and they literally started to earn money
42:39 - in the in
42:40 - in the next week or two as a coach as a
42:43 - coach
42:44 - teaching other people
42:47 - is one great example he was coaching
42:49 - literally within a week
42:50 - by the sunday webinar in the last
42:53 - challenge
42:53 - he has already earned earned more than a
42:56 - hundred dollars
42:57 - oh my god that is amazing so you got
43:00 - past level one basically yeah
43:01 - now yeah level three maybe you know some
43:03 - projects right so maybe you build some
43:04 - projects you have some good confidence
43:06 - right so you know
43:06 - you know that at this point what can you
43:08 - teach do you think you could teach level
43:10 - one and
43:11 - now you're here you can teach this and
43:13 - you can teach this also right
43:14 - exactly the possibilities are endless
43:16 - and it goes on
43:18 - and on and on and on go ahead and here's
43:20 - the cool thing as you're teaching these
43:21 - things
43:22 - you're reinforcing what you're learning
43:24 - and getting
43:26 - i think jesse jesse says when you're
43:29 - teaching you get to learn it twice
43:31 - yeah right exactly you get to learn
43:33 - twice so
43:34 - that's probably one of the best things
43:35 - let's go ahead but the thing is you know
43:36 - you don't have to worry about level
43:37 - tense when you get to too good it's
43:39 - actually not good for like level 10 to
43:40 - teach all the way level one
43:42 - because level 10 right they are for
43:44 - example they might be like
43:46 - at this point too good like as as in
43:48 - they don't see from perspective of a
43:50 - beginner
43:51 - but because you see it from perspective
43:53 - a beginner that's where things are
43:54 - different and so it's actually easier
43:56 - for you
43:56 - as it began to teach other beginners you
43:58 - understand that exactly so don't be
44:00 - scared of level 10
44:01 - because you're probably a better teacher
44:02 - yes if you're on level three or level
44:04 - four because you
44:05 - just went through that awesome so let's
44:07 - okay so we went to the coaching side
44:09 - oh sure yeah so actually what we're
44:11 - gonna do is we're gonna quickly go
44:12 - through a couple of slides to break it
44:13 - down to help you get to your first
44:15 - you know couple thousand dollars a month
44:18 - if you want to go
44:19 - down this road let's do it okay so let's
44:21 - talk about your stream of income
44:23 - in the first one or three months where
44:24 - you're learning javascript coding okay
44:26 - okay it only applies if you are working
44:28 - hard extremely hard guys of course
44:30 - really important where
44:30 - you know if you're not working hard and
44:32 - what what are you doing what are you
44:33 - doing i think you shouldn't
44:34 - be here sorry like without working hard
44:38 - at work you can't really get nowhere
44:39 - like
44:40 - yeah you know what i mean like yeah and
44:41 - the second thing is you just have to
44:43 - remember
44:43 - you want to teach a person just one or
44:46 - two steps behind you yes
44:48 - correct this exact thing that we're
44:50 - about to get so you can make money
44:51 - through
44:52 - teaching code let's set your hourly rate
44:54 - okay for example let's think about this
44:56 - let's say you already said you started
44:57 - 15 per hour that's pretty good it's
44:59 - awesome that's pretty good okay
45:01 - and especially if you for example
45:02 - actually in another country
45:04 - you still said that it's not really
45:05 - great yes may they be for example you're
45:07 - in
45:08 - pakistan or anywhere everywhere else
45:09 - that's like some besides us
45:12 - that's still pretty good that's really
45:13 - good money great money right
45:15 - okay so usually people we you have let's
45:18 - say four weekly coaching calls okay
45:20 - maybe you have four people you have four
45:21 - weekend coaching calls let's say you
45:22 - know
45:23 - you have four weekly coaching calls
45:25 - meaning you have one coaching call per
45:27 - week
45:28 - in one month you mean how much sixty
45:30 - dollars
45:31 - oh sixty what one per week okay got you
45:33 - yes yes yes yes yes yes you made 60
45:35 - bucks okay
45:36 - that's right there that already is your
45:38 - one two hundred dollar income guys right
45:40 - there
45:40 - okay you already crossed your 100 one to
45:43 - one
45:43 - uh ten two hundred dollar income right
45:45 - there that's your first crossing point
45:46 - okay
45:47 - and all you need is just simply one
45:49 - person
45:51 - you need to find that one person that's
45:53 - it that's it and finally one person is
45:55 - actually not that hard
45:56 - with the amount of demand that there is
45:57 - right now for coding
45:59 - okay up next so let's talk about how we
46:01 - can find these students
46:02 - well what you just need to find is 50 to
46:04 - 100 qualified people yes if you just
46:06 - have a 5
46:07 - conversion rate you'll be getting 2 to 5
46:10 - students
46:11 - a week yes so if you think about this
46:13 - right so let's think about what
46:14 - five percent conversion rate five
46:16 - percent conversion conversion rate what
46:18 - does that mean
46:18 - daniel that means if you get a hundred
46:20 - people to talk to you
46:22 - five of them are gonna become clients to
46:24 - talk
46:25 - to talk talk five
46:28 - five are clients now how much is it how
46:31 - hard is it to talk to 100 people
46:33 - well it's really not that hard if we go
46:36 - to the next slide where we could show
46:37 - you exactly
46:38 - where we can find them look at this but
46:41 - before we even go there guys
46:43 - right if you think about this five let's
46:44 - say five our clients okay
46:46 - you're looking at potential income of
46:48 - 120 to 100
46:51 - right and 300 per month now guys i just
46:54 - want to re-emphasize this
46:55 - some people look at these numbers and
46:57 - laugh at them or say like that's not
46:58 - enough yeah but guys
47:00 - if you're getting started in the
47:01 - freelancing world if you're getting
47:03 - someone to pay you fifteen dollars for
47:06 - one
47:06 - session for you to teach for one hour
47:09 - for one hour for you to teach them
47:10 - something you are developing an
47:13 - incredible
47:14 - skill at this point that's only gonna
47:15 - help you to increase this
47:17 - further time and time again to where
47:18 - potentially your one hour
47:20 - can be worth like nauseous which is 250
47:23 - yes
47:24 - dollars i now charge i now charge people
47:27 - who want to just probably do private
47:28 - coaching
47:29 - i charge 250 dollars per hour guys
47:32 - and that is not a joke and that's
47:34 - because i can show you the proof exactly
47:36 - that's because nas has built up the
47:37 - skill
47:38 - over time but he started somewhere he
47:39 - started actually he didn't even start
47:41 - here he started for free he told you
47:43 - he worked for free for an entire year
47:45 - and a half guys
47:46 - because he understands that you just
47:48 - need to build the skill over time so
47:50 - yeah 120 to 300 a month is amazing
47:53 - it's just nas didn't even do that i know
47:56 - you just need to be a little [ __ ]
47:58 - my my per month was zero
48:01 - per month that's how i started guys
48:04 - right there zero per month let me show
48:05 - you
48:06 - zero per month guys what and by the way
48:09 - guys we'll go go ahead and finish up and
48:10 - then we'll we'll give you a shout out
48:11 - zero month guys
48:13 - guys i think again guys i just want to
48:14 - show you we have one
48:16 - another domain donation which is amazing
48:18 - thank you so much the rich programmer
48:20 - mr frank himself ramos
48:23 - so much man awesome video finding great
48:25 - ways to make a living writing code
48:27 - let's go frank thank you so much for the
48:31 - 4.99 donation i was like 4.99 you know
48:35 - not five or forty nine we're going to be

48:40 - appreciate your support
48:41 - and your love for the community man yeah
48:43 - always always awesome guys
48:44 - okay cool so now let's talk about case
48:46 - you've understood that it's possible and
48:48 - it wouldn't be cool to just make 300
48:49 - extra per month like that's that's still
48:51 - pretty good amount of cash
48:52 - amazing like you could you know towards
48:54 - the car towards anything towards maybe
48:56 - not tesla but towards the
48:57 - regardless anything else you know what i
48:59 - mean amazing but
49:00 - where to find students now let's talk
49:02 - about this okay where do you find now
49:04 - students okay
49:05 - five students well there's many places
49:07 - guys to find people
49:09 - for you okay uh well
49:12 - if you think about funny people there's
49:15 - one thing to think about
49:17 - that's not the gary vee always says it's
49:19 - attention
49:20 - wherever there is attention guys if
49:22 - there's a tension
49:24 - that's where you go looking for it make
49:25 - sense good
49:27 - because here's the thing now where is
49:29 - attention facebook groups and stage
49:31 - number one
49:33 - instagram attention number two why is
49:35 - that intention number three right
49:37 - why isn't this is where you can actually
49:38 - apply as a teacher and just literally
49:40 - find clients like that
49:41 - take lessons another attention okay
49:43 - linkedin you have
49:44 - hundreds of people who are looking to
49:46 - learn to become programmers guys i'm not
49:48 - kidding
49:48 - craigslist put up your craigslist ad
49:51 - fiverr oh fire probably the best place
49:53 - to start
49:53 - you start out with literally five
49:55 - dollars that's your first starting point
49:56 - there's hundreds of people looking for
49:57 - you right
49:58 - but these facebook groups this is where
50:00 - some of our students actually
50:02 - found their students rishi one of the
50:04 - guys
50:05 - who was maybe even a chat but he's
50:06 - actually working with us right now
50:08 - he started off by finding people through
50:10 - instagram through facebook groups
50:12 - literally he just called cold called he
50:14 - went to
50:15 - you know what he did what'd he do he
50:18 - went to
50:19 - coding coding facebook groups like right
50:21 - now guys right now if you guys have time
50:23 - i mean still stay on this
50:24 - live call but find a facebook go to
50:27 - facebook.com
50:28 - and do type in javascript group
50:31 - like javascript for example javascript
50:35 - group right there right this will give
50:37 - you a humongous javascript
50:38 - of people who are interested in
50:40 - javascript boom right there
50:42 - it's so simple you go there you start
50:45 - helping people out
50:46 - you reach out to them directly you say
50:48 - hey i see what you're doing this is
50:50 - amazing it by the way
50:51 - if you're interested in potentially
50:52 - getting learning more javascript
50:55 - i myself am a teacher and i love to
50:56 - teach and would love to teach you as
50:58 - well
50:58 - again if you're interested let's get on
50:59 - a call literally just say that and
51:01 - you're done
51:02 - make sense makes sense and then you and
51:04 - then you close them exactly so i've
51:05 - gotten 100 people from all these
51:07 - different spots
51:08 - the next thing is over time as you build
51:11 - your skill
51:12 - you're just gonna want to learn how to
51:14 - increase your charges
51:15 - exactly right so when you first start
51:17 - out you might be making what you might
51:19 - be making what 15 per hour
51:20 - 15 per hour 15 per hour let me see 15
51:23 - per hour right there
51:25 - okay that might be starting rate but
51:27 - again as you get better your price
51:28 - increases guys okay
51:30 - as you get better as you get more
51:31 - clients your price increases
51:32 - dramatically so you might be going from
51:33 - 15 per hour
51:34 - to now let's say at this point you might
51:36 - be going towards uh
51:38 - let me get the brush tool here you know
51:40 - you are going towards what
51:41 - 15 to 25 per hour within three months
51:43 - actually probably been faster like
51:45 - literally guys when you have your first
51:47 - client your second client might be 25
51:49 - per hour literally right
51:50 - there that's what i've been told a lot
51:51 - of times 25 per hour
51:53 - your first client just to get from the
51:55 - door for 50 per hour your next client
51:57 - increase the price of 25 per hour
51:59 - done you're done pro tip do group
52:01 - coaches instead of individual coaching
52:03 - charge more pro clients yes
52:04 - so this is actually one time of the
52:06 - rishi we should probably talk to rishi
52:07 - about this because that's really cool
52:08 - this is what he does so so well is he
52:11 - started out with doing
52:12 - group coaching with people and so he'd
52:14 - be able to actually make
52:15 - about 2k per month or one i think 1k or
52:17 - 2k per month
52:18 - just on group coaching right you put
52:21 - everybody into this
52:22 - humongous group right and the coach all
52:24 - of them
52:25 - that's cool because you have one hour
52:26 - you're spending right on
52:28 - 10 20 different people who paid you the
52:30 - same amount of money
52:32 - that's huge man right you're making your
52:34 - time worth it even more i mean think
52:36 - about this right
52:36 - let's say you have 10 people on the
52:38 - group coaching let's say they paid you
52:40 - 15 per hour so it's 15 per 15 people
52:42 - okay
52:43 - they paid you how let's say 15 10 people
52:46 - that's 150
52:47 - okay 150 let me see uh 150 bucks
52:51 - right guys this is real stuff 150 bucks
52:54 - okay
52:55 - for one session for one session now and
52:58 - you get them on a group coaching call
53:01 - and now one hour is how much one hour is
53:03 - not equal to what one hour is equal to
53:05 - what now
53:06 - 150. 150 bro
53:10 - guys like this just literally insane yes
53:13 - and guys the reason we're teaching this
53:14 - it doesn't matter if you want to go full
53:16 - time
53:16 - or doesn't matter if you want to go
53:17 - freelancing this is something
53:19 - that anyone can pick up as they're
53:21 - starting out can start to generate an
53:23 - extra side income while learning how to
53:26 - code and
53:27 - examine how to master exactly the skills
53:29 - awesome you're well on your way to
53:31 - making your first hundred dollars
53:33 - with code from there pretty much awesome
53:36 - so
53:36 - like i said we did coaching we did that
53:38 - your next step is what
53:40 - you could go into freelancing and this
53:41 - is the path that you want to go
53:43 - into again and this depends guys
53:45 - freelancing there's two different
53:46 - there's three different paths right
53:48 - you can do freelancing you can do things
53:50 - like full-time potential right it
53:51 - depends on you
53:52 - right a lot of people will start out
53:54 - with full time right away before they
53:55 - begin to freelance so it really depends
53:57 - on
53:57 - what you can do on which you're able to
53:59 - keep evolve okay make sense
54:01 - good so we have freelance and that's
54:03 - part one okay now there's a freelancer
54:05 - that might require you a few months for
54:06 - you to know just a little bit because if
54:08 - you know zero it might be a little bit
54:09 - hard okay
54:10 - okay so we have and that's where you for
54:13 - example you might be making you know an
54:14 - income of 5k per month that's when
54:16 - you've got your 5k per month okay
54:17 - exactly and again these are just
54:18 - different things that you could start to
54:20 - learn
54:21 - on the side to build these different
54:22 - incomes as well awesome so you can make
54:25 - money through freelancing skills of
54:26 - course translate to what translate to
54:29 - hourly rates
54:30 - right there transit to income pretty
54:31 - simple stuff makes sense cool
54:33 - so you can charge more for freelancing
54:35 - games of course now your hourly
54:36 - rate might be here what 30 to 50 per
54:38 - hour but you might have more hours you
54:40 - might not be doing 40 hours or 20 hours
54:42 - per week
54:42 - let's say for example right so let's say
54:44 - that's 20 hours per week 20 hours per
54:46 - week
54:47 - per week how much is that per week if
54:50 - you make it let's say 30
54:51 - 30 bucks 30 uh 600 that's 600
54:54 - 600 per week you might be making right
54:56 - there right and how much is that per uh
54:59 - per month so now 2 000 2 000
55:02 - 2 400 per month and that is a pretty
55:05 - damn good salary i would say so and guys
55:07 - if you remember what nas showed you
55:09 - right now we said like if you're level
55:10 - one level two level three all the way to
55:11 - level ten
55:12 - yes once you start to get to those
55:13 - higher levels you can graduate
55:15 - from tutoring and start to pick up these
55:17 - contracts that might pay your hourly
55:19 - rate a little bit more as well yes
55:20 - and again this is where you guys get to
55:22 - build things like okay
55:24 - like projects websites small
55:25 - applications like chrome extensions
55:27 - wordpress sites who knows all those
55:29 - things this is where this is how you
55:31 - get started okay next up so where to
55:34 - find clients find clients on freelancing
55:36 - sites
55:36 - like for example there's like upwork
55:39 - upwork like for example freelancer
55:43 - freelancer right there but most
55:45 - importantly you know where to fight
55:46 - clients most importantly bro
55:47 - i was assuming probably in the facebook
55:49 - groups as well and just yes
55:50 - facebook groups but also
55:54 - also something nas did a lot what is it
55:57 - it's actually through people you know
56:00 - it's for people you know that's part one
56:02 - so
56:02 - through people you know so through
56:03 - connections so connections are very
56:06 - important here guys connections
56:08 - go ahead and ask friends your family ask
56:10 - your friends at your front hand like
56:11 - hey guys you but do you know anybody who
56:14 - needs help
56:15 - right but once you got that then
56:18 - conferences
56:19 - right there go to conferences meet
56:21 - people network
56:23 - this is actually how i got my first gig
56:26 - as a freelancer this is how i got paid
56:29 - my first i think
56:30 - i got paid nine thousand dollars for a
56:32 - project wow yes
56:34 - as my first gig so that was pretty damn
56:36 - good i would say so i mean i worked like
56:37 - my ass off for this honestly but
56:39 - but still right conferences one of the
56:42 - most important things to get the best
56:44 - why do you think they exist it's because
56:45 - of people who make money on there right
56:47 - so learn how to write good proposals
56:49 - take time to identify
56:50 - uh what's the code that was interesting
56:54 - that was not good all right take time to
56:56 - find identify clients potential
56:58 - requirements and so forth okay awesome
57:00 - so make your clients search for you
57:02 - really important guys of course
57:03 - you don't want to just be reaching out
57:04 - to clients always you want them to reach
57:06 - out to you
57:07 - as well and this is where social media
57:08 - comes in so so important guys okay

64:57 - what you'll notice is everything we
64:58 - talked about is universal
64:59 - if you want to be a freelancer or if you
65:01 - want to get a job all these things apply
65:04 - you could make money tutoring and
65:05 - helping people learning how to program
65:07 - you could find the right networks at
65:09 - conferences like even if you're looking
65:10 - for a job there's probably recruiters
65:12 - are going to be there's gonna be other
65:13 - software engineers of big tech companies
65:15 - that are like the google io conference
65:17 - right if you schedule your time properly
65:19 - if you schedule daily actions
65:21 - whether it's like hey i gotta learn how
65:22 - to code this stuff or hey i gotta reach
65:23 - out to these people
65:24 - you're gonna be successful so everything
65:26 - we've talked about here is gonna apply
65:27 - to you
65:28 - whether you're trying to make six
65:29 - figures as a freelancer or through a
65:31 - full-time job
65:32 - exactly and really important i just i
65:34 - kind of thought about this one amazing
65:36 - way to find people as well is actually
65:38 - nowhere
65:39 - hackathons oh that is huge yeah
65:42 - networking opportunity amazing
65:44 - networking opportunity guys this is
65:46 - where you find people who are not only
65:47 - developers
65:48 - but potential startup companies who want
65:50 - to hire you for example
65:52 - uh businesses freelancers right people
65:55 - this is the
65:55 - probably on the best networking
65:56 - solutions like for you honestly
65:59 - find a hackathon near you and go there
66:01 - dina
66:02 - one of our students is one to a
66:05 - hackathon
66:05 - want the hackathon and guess what she
66:08 - now has
66:09 - a job as a react.js developer amazing
66:12 - like
66:13 - done you know what i mean and by the way
66:15 - we just got a great question now that i
66:16 - think you're gonna like
66:17 - they said how do we address not having
66:19 - any
66:20 - experience or any relevant experience on
66:22 - a resume
66:23 - well if you don't experience then what
66:25 - you have is pretty simple guys what you
66:27 - have is something called projects guys
66:28 - this is where you put down your projects
66:30 - okay everything that you've done right
66:32 - so for example you see how this section
66:34 - right here this
66:34 - blue section this blue section is only
66:37 - mainly for projects
66:39 - this is the only way we will showcase
66:40 - people that hey this is what i can do
66:42 - this is what i did that's what i left to
66:45 - do
66:45 - so what is a great example of a project
66:49 - i mean what do you think well definitely
66:51 - what we did in the past three days we
66:53 - were able to build
66:54 - an amazing slack clone these are the
66:57 - projects that you could start to learn
66:59 - and you can put on your portfolio
67:00 - exactly so slack clone maybe
67:02 - like for example whatsapp clone but
67:04 - really important guys is don't just
67:05 - build them and copy them
67:06 - i would say build them but also add your
67:09 - own features right add
67:10 - your own features right and then once
67:12 - you're adding your own features can i
67:14 - give you a really
67:14 - small piece of advice this is what our
67:17 - students
67:18 - this is what our students at pwg do they
67:20 - build what they have
67:22 - in our course and then they rebuild it
67:26 - by themselves by themselves
67:30 - again again by themselves fully man
67:34 - fully by themselves that is how you're
67:36 - actually learning it yeah
67:38 - they don't watch the video they don't
67:40 - watch the tutorial know nothing they
67:42 - just rebuild it this is how
67:43 - you probably will learn the most and so
67:46 - you put that on your portfolio you put
67:48 - that on your projects and that's how
67:49 - people see you
67:50 - put yourself out on social media and you
67:52 - should
67:53 - you will you will get the opportunity
67:55 - that you want
67:56 - okay up next okay let's go and move on
67:59 - so
67:59 - really quickly guys as you said uh
68:03 - write a cover letter prepare your
68:04 - interview guys do mock interviews with
68:06 - your friends
68:07 - right around you don't just go into an
68:09 - interview just being fully blank
68:11 - do mock interviews with people around
68:12 - you and negotiate yourself this is gonna
68:14 - happen
68:15 - probably later on when you first get the
68:16 - interview or when you actually get the
68:18 - job so
68:19 - don't worry about this part so much
68:20 - right now this is not the most important
68:21 - part your most important part is just to
68:23 - get the job
68:24 - yes so guys this is the road map
68:28 - to become a web developer specifically a
68:31 - six figure developer because if we look
68:33 - at how much a
68:34 - web developer makes on average you'll
68:37 - notice
68:38 - that it's above six figures right
68:40 - especially if you just go
68:41 - on indeed or anywhere you can look up
68:43 - these jobs with front of developer
68:44 - react js javascript developer what we
68:47 - just learned in these last couple days
68:48 - and this road map that we built out for
68:50 - you guys could be either through
68:52 - just doing your own thing trying to be a
68:53 - freelancer trying to find a full-time
68:55 - job as we showed you the tips you want
68:56 - to do or
68:57 - even both at the same time guys
69:01 - now this opportunity is amazing right

69:05 - mean if you go for example to indeed.com

70:05 - of thousands more opportunities yes
70:06 - they're just always coming in and always
70:08 - growing i literally when i
70:09 - when i researched this like literally
70:11 - two months ago when we did a top five
70:13 - program languages video
70:14 - on youtube it was 50 000 jobs and it's
70:18 - just growing this was only two months
70:19 - ago
70:19 - this is now 61 000 jobs and the crazy
70:22 - thing is
70:22 - it's only 10 000 more a lot of those are
70:25 - probably new so it's probably like 40
70:27 - 000.
70:27 - look at this guys also developer
70:30 - urgently hiring easy apply
70:32 - 100 to 130k per year they want to throw
70:35 - money at you right now they're just
70:37 - grabbing the money and throwing it at
70:39 - you if you have the skills
70:41 - yes yes now granted i'm not gonna like
70:43 - [ __ ] you saying that you're gonna be
70:45 - making this right away okay
70:46 - you need to learn things like for
70:47 - example right aws
70:49 - my javascript look at this javascript
70:51 - look at this right there boom boom right
70:53 - bro look at this it's good it's come
70:55 - from awesome just
70:56 - react okay now again and just to be
70:59 - mindful
71:00 - you don't have to know everything in ten
71:02 - hun here you need to know at least
71:03 - one thing that's on here okay a lot of
71:05 - these job postings that will have
71:06 - aws they have like 20 different
71:08 - technologies
71:09 - they're just doing it to screw you off
71:11 - the purpose of that
71:13 - is to scare people off who are not
71:14 - capable of learning something like this
71:16 - that's the whole goal
71:17 - so when you see something like this and
71:19 - you're like okay well i don't know this
71:20 - i don't know this i know this i know a
71:23 - little of this me but i don't know this

71:28 - will not be hurt if you just simply
71:29 - apply guys okay you will not be hurt at

71:35 - exactly guys you know what i mean
71:37 - awesome so let's go ahead and again
71:39 - you will not be making this this amount
71:40 - of money right away it might take you
71:42 - some time
71:43 - but you might be looking at making you
71:44 - know 70 80k
71:46 - yeah per year depending exactly there's
71:49 - nothing wrong with starting at that 60
71:50 - 000
71:51 - year and building up to this over time
71:54 - yes
71:54 - because again if this is something that
71:56 - you're trying to do if you're trying to
71:56 - do a career transition or this is the
71:58 - first career trying to start yeah this
71:59 - is a lifelong process
72:01 - it's a lifelong process if you can earn
72:03 - 60 000 the next year
72:05 - 70 80 and it takes you a couple years to
72:07 - get to the six figures
72:08 - but then for the rest of your life the
72:09 - next 20 to 30 years you're gonna be
72:11 - earning six figures
72:12 - is that not worth it it's all worth it

77:12 - that is your homework your homework is
77:13 - to register for the webinar that is your
77:15 - homework
77:16 - so mozambique just asked a question he
77:18 - said
77:19 - daniel what kind of projects can i do to
77:22 - integrate data structures like search
77:25 - and sort
77:26 - cues and trees well that's a good
77:28 - question it's actually something we do
77:30 - in our program yes that is a great talk
77:32 - about it for a second yeah we should
77:33 - definitely talk about it so
77:35 - this is a great question because very
77:36 - often i remember when i was in
77:37 - university yes we would do
77:39 - all these crazy algorithm data
77:40 - structures but i never really saw
77:42 - a purpose to them and it wasn't until
77:45 - when i got to the interview questions
77:46 - where they kind of added a purpose to it
77:48 - right
77:49 - yeah so a specific one was when i was
77:50 - google when i was interviewing with
77:52 - google
77:52 - they asked me hey i want you to create
77:55 - an autocomplete
77:56 - so imagine you have a search bar you're
77:57 - typing something in and then there's an
77:59 - auto complete that comes out from that
78:01 - what are you gonna do
78:02 - i was like oh my god what am i gonna do
78:04 - so i like start trying to think of these
78:06 - solutions
78:06 - and i ended up coming and modeling a
78:08 - solution that i didn't know about but
78:09 - it's called the try
78:11 - right and what this try is it's a form
78:13 - of a tree
78:14 - that allows you to search through
78:16 - basically different
78:18 - words that you put into the tree
78:19 - structure and it optimizes it so it
78:22 - doesn't take too long especially if you
78:23 - have millions of words
78:24 - inside of the tree yeah it's really cool
78:27 - it's something we do with our students
78:30 - sorry yeah so i'll just say well now
78:32 - he's going to say while he finishes
78:33 - chewing and
78:34 - drinking but this is what we decided
78:36 - we're like guys let's take this project
78:38 - and put it into our full stack mastery
78:41 - bootcamp yes
78:42 - guys yes and that is one of the projects
78:44 - out one of the hundreds of projects
78:45 - they're gonna build
78:46 - because these are the things that you
78:48 - have to build and learn so you
78:49 - understand them
78:50 - and you understand how they work and how
78:52 - they're applicable it's so much fun and
78:53 - because you get to apply the real world
78:55 - the scenario of something like this
78:56 - you get to learn so much and of course
78:59 - guys these are really
79:00 - it's a meal great question by the way
79:03 - it's a really important topic that you
79:05 - you guys need to focus on okay stop
79:07 - working so much and just being fancy
79:09 - with all your projects
79:10 - do the projects yes but also focus on
79:12 - the fundamentals and the basics
79:15 - focus on those i cannot stress this
79:16 - enough if you don't focus on
79:18 - fundamentals and the basics which by the
79:20 - way is something we focus on
79:21 - very much in pwj and focus mastery as
79:23 - well
79:25 - you will not get the job i'm sorry
79:29 - because when you go to the job what do
79:31 - you think they're testing you for
79:33 - it's pretty simple they are testing you
79:35 - for your problem solving skills and your
79:37 - algorithm skills
79:38 - that's it they're not going to ask you
79:40 - hey can you write me for example a
79:42 - react.js component
79:43 - app or whatever might be right the com
79:46 - the reality is apps is what gets you to
79:48 - the interview right that's your
79:49 - portfolio
79:50 - they see it it's nice okay interesting
79:52 - person let's talk to them
79:54 - when you talk to them they're going to
79:57 - talk to you about what
79:59 - your fundamentals your problem solving
80:02 - how good are you at being able to step
80:03 - outside the box
80:06 - and find a solution to a problem
80:09 - he's really good at finding social to a
80:11 - problem like too good
80:13 - i'm mad at him sometimes yeah literally
80:19 - you know what i mean so that's just one
80:21 - example right
80:23 - so please follow this so yes muslim
80:24 - that's a great question so try is one
80:25 - great another one another one might be
80:27 - for example uh
80:28 - um undo for example um the undo section
80:31 - for example when you do undo that
80:32 - actually has to do with stacks you have
80:33 - to create two stacks
80:35 - the the undo functionality on your
80:37 - computer
80:38 - on like a text editor or anything like
80:39 - that yes exactly so that hopefully that
80:41 - answers your question so before we dive
80:43 - into the questions we also forgot to

88:15 - where uh probably just a couple more up
88:20 - oh my gosh are you the most up to date
88:23 - yeah it is all right it wasn't that far
88:25 - up

88:32 - to impress potential employees with
88:34 - react gs well for one
88:36 - i mean the slack loan here that you just
88:38 - built is amazing so make sure it's clean
88:40 - and make sure it's nice that's part
88:41 - one um yeah i mean it's pretty much any
88:45 - big
88:45 - project that that includes a lot of you
88:47 - know different parts so like for example
88:50 - react gs for example my includes
88:51 - components right style components right
88:53 - anything that may be a little more
88:54 - difficult than just normal that should
88:57 - be always your goal right and you don't
88:58 - just want to do just like for example
89:00 - you know one project do a few projects
89:01 - do a project with one page for example
89:03 - a full stack app with slot clone right
89:06 - include login right that's a big thing
89:07 - that people look for is can you can you
89:09 - put a login functionality right

89:12 - right can you do that
89:14 - um that's always something you want to
89:16 - look for is what
89:17 - features can i include in a project so
89:20 - login
89:21 - logout right maybe live
89:24 - time chat application more pages for
89:27 - example maybe for slack loan guys one
89:28 - thing you can add is
89:29 - a profile page so when you click on your

92:42 - thank you so much i put in my calendar
92:43 - let's go christian it's a good question
92:45 - okay
92:46 - that's a good question here what do you
92:47 - think is it valuable to learn
92:50 - how to sort data structures without the
92:53 - use of methods
92:54 - methods yeah i think it's important to
92:56 - at least know
92:58 - the fastest most optimal ways of is it
93:01 - sorting
93:01 - or yeah of sorting a specific data
93:04 - structure
93:04 - like an array right so in this case if
93:07 - you're going to be doing sorting you
93:08 - could either learn quick sort
93:10 - or merge sort those have both the same
93:12 - big o notation
93:13 - of n login which is the most optimal for
93:16 - sorting
93:16 - you just have to know one of those yes i
93:18 - mean you also can know that
93:20 - you can have a dot sort function that
93:22 - helps you out and does it for you
93:23 - but if you just know the implementation
93:25 - you at least understand how the inner
93:27 - workings of the dot sort function
93:29 - work you don't have to go crazy you
93:30 - don't have to go learn bubble sort
93:32 - and all these other ones but as long as
93:34 - you know the important ones yes

day four right here nine thousand ten thousand look at this people watching which is just holy and this time we got 81 dollars in donations yeah we we're getting we we greatly appreciate the clever programmer community i mean it means so much to us when you're donating because it's telling us that we're doing our job right by bringing as much value as we can to you guys correct guys and that's the thing guys so and crazy enough we got the dance for the money too so that's pretty cool too oh i've never been able to see it in my life before until now until now right 20 bucks not bad so here's some products that you guys got to build look at this george george cisco holy moly he did an amazing job mode looks cool look at this black mold you know the normal mode he's got the buttons on the bottom that looks so good a nice job we have for example who's this shirag crazy i love the curves on this one look at this look look how curvy it is i also i also like the user how it's like no background yeah just a picture i mean i know those are just the images but regardless it's like very clean very cut it's nice i like this too i will say i like this too cool let me next we got who else we got we got noohla nukula i don't get what this is still i don't understand how this works i think she's just pointing out that she added a hover effect so like if you hover over that it's gonna change color icon something like are you sure it doesn't if you hover over it just becomes like this jagged thing i i don't think nulla would add that function i'm not even sure how to do that honestly myself yeah z look at this amazing i love this simple style this is a very very simple style this is actually probably one of the best designs i've seen honestly look at that on the dark mode it's got a little moon on yeah this is the best slack clone and it has a moon right there that's pretty good i like it cool gabriel look at this amazing job as well so clean so nice i love how you guys added the colors for yourselves and of course a man and i think it's amanda dev is the name of uh amanda amanda but they're so awesome as well look at this blockchain looks like it looks like

i'll tell you because here in this one i'll do a little bit more broad side of things you know and this one was going to be very deep down and we'll talk just how you can do it and not only that we're

just move on okay cool do it man let's go ahead and do it let's go ahead and move on so we got all this amazing project guys so what makes a six sticker developer that is the question daniel what makes a 65 developer well there's lots of things but it's gonna boil down to just a few things right because when we're trying to become the six figure developer we have that goal and we set it out in front of us so that we can hit it you're going to want to work on specific skill sets whether technical or soft skills and you're going to want to develop yourself as a person to be able to get to that point of being a six figure developer yes yes yes so guys let's let's check it out so hello i like money i mean of course everybody likes money crusher crab loves money very much okay who doesn't love money you know we always say a lot mine does not make us happy and at some points it does but not having mine does not make us happy either so so you have to be careful with that exactly so as you do want to make more money you need to make sure you have that roadmap right you want to make sure that you have the goal set up in front of you the right one so that you could work closer and closer to achieving it day and day again and that's why nas is going to break down his experience so you can have that road map and then we're going to just dive deep into becoming six figures guys very important that's going to smash that like button for the youtube algorithm as you know we have done an amazing job i would say so the past four days as the day five so i would appreciate that if you guys just smash it if you just go ahead and share this video with everybody else just again the more people the more people view it the more people know about it the better that way we get to share the knowledge that we currently have with the more people again let's go ahead and get to 200 likes we are currently at 147 i never get 200 really quickly all right so how i made 300k as a javascript developer in three years myself guys hi my 300k and i how i made 300k and how i also got a tesla so there's that part too i can actually use that now you got to add that part man yeah exactly i recently got a tesla as well so that's been amazing too so guys check this out and again i'm not saying this guys just to like brag or anything like that my that's not my goal i'm here to teach i'm here to teach you i'm head to inspire that is my goal that's our goal of everybody daniel and everybody here at clever programmer okay we just want to show you what's possible look at this this is one of the things that i went through and when i kind of got started guys you know i started in the same shoes as you are which is not knowing much i knew some basic maybe html css and that's pretty much it but as i kind of work through you know this is one i want to show you some of the things that i got this is a 19 per hour uh internship that i had at a company called urban science and they kind of given the internship after i worked at another company for a startup company completely for free for literally like you know like a year and a half which has been insane okay this is a 65k after i did so well at this job we're literally i'm not kidding bro at this job i like i exceeded expectations like i got like crazy and what did you do to be able to do that like what do what did i do that's a question so here's what i did like not only i did the project yes i did the project i did um see i did the project i created projects right for them with them right but also i use i worked really fast and part one actually is i went about beyond to include more features i went above and beyond above and beyond beyond to include more features to include include more features not kidding what actually happened guys it was insane what actually happened here is they have this project every intern had a project to do i did it really fast no problem they're like holy [ __ ] how to do this so fast and then what i do is i end up taking a machine learning course a machine learning course of course because i apply machine i have found out that i can apply machine learning to their problem and what i did is i basically created machine learning algorithm that predicted how many leads they'll get in the next few years wow that is huge like prediction like predicting leads and when they saw that they're like holy [ __ ] you know everybody else is kind of doing the projects that they've been told to do i went outside the box and there's something different and that was blew their mind and the other day i got a chance to talk with their head machine learning uh machine learning guy and after he saw this go talk with him he offered the job to beat his team right away like because he loved the the intention so far and then that's when i got offered the 65 k right here right here that's what happens when you just offer value right when you bring value to the table when you build your skill sets when you learn new things that are applicable to the job to adding value to a business or company yes you get these amazing offers yes and the crazy thing is again this was i didn't even finish college like college is not the reason why i'm here because it's not the reason why i got this or why i got this but the reason why i got this is because i was very proactive i was very bold like being bold is big guys being bold is very big okay and being able to be risky and be risky with what you want to do and being [ __ ] like being so damn on the line in terms of what you want to do in your life okay that's the most important thing if you just kind of stand around waiting for things to happen they won't happen i'm sorry but if you be bold and if you go towards it like a bowl that's when change gets created okay awesome let's move on there's another company this is uh actually i had did not go with this company when they offered me this money because this other company offered me this money so by the way and again this was a oneday interview and they love what i end up doing and they offer me uh this is again college is not even finished yet so they offered me 70k right after that so that was really cool uh again this is a company after when i just started doing freelancing i worked for com with the company called approved me when i did freelancing that was a lot of fun i got to build one of the biggest react.js projects this whole project was in react.js pro wow and it had millions of millions of lines of code millions of lines of code it was in thai script react gs redux all the stuff you guys learned here learned here this is teaching from like our our knowledge from our real world experience to you right this is real word world stuff i'm not kidding i'm not kidding okay and this was a fun project this project actually is still going on one of my friends is still working with them but of course i'm not because i'm so focused with you guys okay awesome so another project i worked with something called cover me really amazing guys again these guys paid about five thousand five thousand dollars oh just so you know these guys paid around twenty thousand dollars but that's only for about a month and a half so so that was pretty good you know that was pretty good so um uh discovered me another project do they pay 5k not for the design but they paid 5k honestly just for a software requirements document which by the way is something we teach how to do in profit javascript again you will have the early bird price on sunday so make sure you go there okay but they literally just paid me for a requirements document for 5k just to build this like to put build requirements out can you believe that bro that is huge that's insane that's crazy yeah so and so like like like i know you're like like yes you did all this stuff but how did you do it now it's like how did they happen well it didn't happen overnight and didn't happen easy and it was not easy and it took a lot of sweat and tears okay but how did it happen it's a good question well so again this is me you guys know um just a regular guy just like you are you guys are but i'm very i love my work and i'm very hard working that's the one thing that i can tell about myself okay um yeah i gotta get a chance to interview companies like google khan academy squarespace this is a lot of fun these guys actually flew me out to california for free they gave me a really nice hotel and uh paid for everything pretty much that was a lot of fun safety with valentin another great company again flew me out to california literally the hotel pro apparently was 500 per night and i didn't pay for anything nice that was insane that's amazing that was a lot of fun yeah and i got a chance to interview all these companies and so yeah that's kind of about me uh what i end up doing is when i started guys um the process was really cool because i started i realized that college was no good unfortunately college college college college will not not will not get you to get you the real real world experience i'm saying just college i'm not saying college is uh unnecessary i'm not saying any of those things um i'm not get you the real world experience periods i know i have a horrible typing that's okay though uh um experience hold on here's a great coder trust me experience right there he has a lot of typos he's a great character right so the way i kind of found that out is because i was learning a lot of theory as i'm sure you know too right like you learn a lot of theories well in college correct yep and how did you how do you think that kind of helped you out tell me like do you think that something will really push you in in the real world tell me i mean most of what really helped me was what i did on the side which were like the practical uh projects that i would build right the mobile applications or the web applications yes correct and and so and so what did you realize with with theory in terms of what else do you need besides theory tell me what do you mean by that is anything else you realize that you need did you realize that you need anything something else besides theory tell me um you need practical application you build skills you need to build portfolios right you build projects that are going to be able to help you to get to where you want to go again correct at the end of the day it's about having the skill of being able to build an amazing project by yourself right i'm figuring it out by yourself now i don't mean you have to code every single line i don't mean you have to memorize what every single line of code the function not so if you could use google and youtube to help you out you're going to be able to solve a problem not just memorize lines of codes and write them for your tests and homework assignments correct so guys do this so uh i kind of and so what i end up doing is i actually end up going ahead and joining a startup company right here this is called uh trendella it's really fun these guys are amazing they're still one of my user friends steve here he just got married which is insane steve congrats uh now she's yeah so another one of my friends case and this is me as you guys can see this is robert this guy is doing amazing he's working the company right now he's used epic stuff in terms of coding he loves it but together as four people like we were working on this app that was basically bringing clothing together into one application from all these different applications and i'll show you how exactly how it looks like but i came up to them and said hey guys i'm ready to work for free i'm ready to work for free because i just want the experience i realize that college is not going to get me there and so like you know what let's do it they give me a task to do which is to build a python scraper and granted i literally went home and i i you know what i you know what i typed into google what'd you type i tell you what is python what is it literally that's the first thing i type like what is python because they told me to the python script like what the [ __ ] is python you know what i mean so uh at that point kind of what happened is i was like okay great so i found out what python is i found out how to do scraping and i end up doing business creeper and they brought me on to work with them i work with them for about a year for free completely but that year is what changed my whole life it's the reason why i'm here today with you guys because that knowledge that i got by being bold by investing in myself that is what got me to where i am today and there's still so much further that we can all go between daniel between me everybody here on the team and and you of course and you as well right there's so many possibilities you guys can there's out you just need to take them and be bold and take some risks and that's pretty much it okay and of course work hard awesome let's go on this is the app you build called trandala pretty cool app i would say so right it's a beautiful app it's a beautiful app would you swipe right or swipe left swipe right to like do you swipe left one just like on that one did you swipe right or swipe right in this one all right that was cool that was cool right did you like it yeah i don't sweat i think it's pretty good i think we should buy this bro oh dude it's 100 bucks never mind oh come on bro awesome this is the service.com company that i worked with one of the things i did with them is i rebuilt the whole application guys and one key factor i will give here for you is here it's about um i'll just say this take an issue please take initiative right this is a very important aspect just in life in general especially in coding as well if you take initiative you are someone who's going to be respected very much in coding space or just in real in what life space you know what i mean if you don't wait for things just to happen you just you just do it you're like no i'm gonna get this i want to do this this is what i want to do i'll talk with a friend uh with a peter j because of the student linda and she's so focused on becoming foster she's like i want to do i want to get it done and she's doing amazing i'm so pumped for her to be our student like seriously okay up next let's go ahead take a next okay i realize that service.com this this company here i hit in my job why why did you why did i hit my job i don't know you tell me bro i don't know why i would tell you this bro so here's the and i was like you know what i hate my job but that's it i want to try something different and what is that different do you think i i wanted you wanted to go out on your own yes i want to do star freelancing exactly and i was like peace out guys and he was crazy no it's crazy happened what my uh employer said to me he's like set me down he's like and i'll and i'll just you know close your ears if you have to but he's literally set me down and he said hey nas i'm gonna tell you this as a as a father as an employer as a financial advisor and as a friend you're [ __ ] nuts you're [ __ ] nuts you're [ __ ] nuts and you're [ __ ] and i'm not kidding they this was said this was actually said to me right because i quit at the time when the company was going up right uh but i was not happy you know again being bold okay me being bold taking initiative right and you know what and end up working out pretty well yes i quit but look at this and i started doing freelancing i decided i was like you know what i like this i really took a lot of initiative in terms of my you know my appearance in terms of who i am as a person my confidence and i started to build my account start to build my my freelancing kind of business on the side as well and that's what kind of got me you know to where i am even today and so oh that's a cool picture bro look at this bro that's in the same picture that's so good i'm jealous wait wait wait you guys this is in detroit guys shout out to detroit if anybody here from detroit guys anybody here on detroit hey if you guys are let us know i think that'd be awesome cool so yeah detroit that was all amazing so now let's let's do this okay what do we do next daniel tell me well next we're going to make this about you you already heard nasa's story you already heard what he did but now we're going to turn the tables and make it about you so take out your pen take out your paper because we're going to start to figure out your goals to help you to get to where you want to go so it's all going to start with just figuring out your financial goal and what that is going to look like exactly so let's do this right now what is your plan right of course let's figure out your income goals that's the first thing because if you get if you don't write this kind of stuff down it's not going to be helpful for you at whatsoever does that do you make sense so how much income do you want to make per month in the comments below right now guys how much income do you want to make per month let us know right now okay three thousand don't be like oh crazy i'm like i wanna make a million per month right now okay let's be real realistic okay let's not let's actually be your list in terms of what you want to make and what that will cover right now so you can go like grow your career as a developer yeah i mean you could build up to the million later after you build a cool business but you need to build some skills first so first let's get you to those milestones that are gonna be in your realm of doing within this next year 2021. so let's say let's say this for example everybody's saying like 3k 5k 5k that's not bad so 5k that's really reasonable one guy said 100k per month okay that's not unreasonable i mean if you're a complete pro you're building your sas company like you have all these crazy skills yes you could do that but if you're not there then so five keep a month how much is that per year six sixty thousand that's 60k per year that was not bad but would you say that for a beginner completely that's amazing that's amazing for a complete beginner bro that is an amazing salary guys most people cannot like most people are it's really hard for them to make that kind of money you know what i mean because you also have to keep in mind this is just your first year starting off entry level after that it's just going to skyrocket as you get better as you learn more skills as you understand what you have to do there's probably going to be raises are going to happen you can move to better companies they're going to pay you way more than what you're what they're currently paying exactly okay so now that you know like your 5k per month okay let's now let's talk about expenses okay what are your personal expenses how much how many expenses do you have right now okay that because your course you need to cover your expenses is very important okay you cannot just be on to your expense if you're under your expenses then you're losing money that's not good okay so what are your expenses for example let's let's how much expenses let's just have an example okay let's just say maybe it's 2k per month how about that maybe it's 2k per month maybe this is includes for example rent maybe it might include for example some food and so forth does it include a tesla bro i mean these are not my expenses [Laughter] these are not my expenses all right my sizes are this there's a little bit more but let's just say uh you know for a person how many expenses would you say okay how about this let's just say fine 3k how about that two keep a month okay yeah i think if maybe you have a family this is something that might be and you're living below your means you're not spending like crazy that sounds about right yeah so what identify what it means for you to be rich okay what does it mean for you to be happy with yourself right because because guys it's not just about money money great it will get you what you want you can go on vacation you can you know spend money for yourself for your family for other members of the family that's always the best part right but what makes you feel welcome and so the way i see it is like if it means for you to be rich is like okay at least maybe you have maybe let's say a thousand you can save per month or two thousand you can save a month would you say that's like let's say maybe say a thousand per month is kind of like a good goal would you say that that sounds good great just just like savings okay so save a thousand 1k 1k per month and keep in mind make sense okay cool 10 specific reasons why you need to make more money income exactly because you need to understand your why because once you understand your expenses once you identify what your rich is whether it's going to be just money whether it's going to be time freedom right you want to be just working 20 hours a week or you're going to want remote work at a fulltime job with amazing benefits whatever that is next you need to know is your why so that's why you say write 10 specific reasons because 10 is going to challenge you a bit it's going to be a little bit hard but if you could sit down and write down 1 through 10 and write a specific reason as to why you want these things it's going to solidify in your head and your purpose and you're gonna have a fuel to get you there correct maybe for example you want freedom right maybe you want to be challenged okay maybe you want to be for example you want to have more time for family right so maybe more time for family time for family maybe you want amazing benefits that big tech companies give out yeah maybe you want amazing benefits who know amazing benefits maybe you just want to work with an amazing team right maybe you just want to love people yeah work with amazing people right with busy people all these are are great reasons for why you want to make more income right amazing people because like it or not if you're going to make more income you're going to be working with amazing people probably like that's honestly that simple right if you're gonna be more in my income those people are also going towards your goal they're also working just as hard as you are right so they're most likely have the same driving goals as you do right so always consider that okay cool so we got that portion now let's ask the question would you in that case freelance or would you full time what do you think like what what do you what what did you select i mean it's really going to be depending on anyone's personal preference right because we we talked about this in day one we want to talk about the opportunity and we broke down the pros and cons of freelancing the pros and cons of fulltime and it's not exhaustive but again we just want to give you guys that perspective so that you could choose for yourself so i think in the end it's about that selfawareness of what you actually want yeah so let's talk about a little bit of uh benefits of freelancing will benefit from fulltime let's show you that okay let's do that right now okay so okay just a few things let's do freelancing right now so freelancing benefits what are some benefits of freelancer tell me so freelancing flexibility on your hours that i think that's a big one that people like billion hours okay what else um you get to choose your clients get to choose your clients that's a positive and you get to choose your clients so a little more context right it's positive because if you do have a lot of clients coming to you you kind of get to choose the ones you're more excited about right and it would be a negative because you have to go figure out how to get your clients right you have to develop some marketing skills you have to develop some selling skills to be able to sell your services to clients that is correct yes okay up next what else is a positive um freelancing let's see man i would say income wise there's a lot of room for growth a lot of room for growth that's true a lot of room for growth you're only limited by how much you want to work right if you want to work less time then obviously you're not going to be making like hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars right yes but you do give yourself more time during the week but on the contrary guys because of there's a lot of room to growth when you first start out you're going to be making bad [ __ ] money i'm not gonna lie like you're gonna be making very little money initially as you started out because you don't have any any clients right now and you have zero trust that's the big issue you have zero trust right now you see what i mean but as you build those up it'll start to snowball over time right so that if you're going as freelancer for a couple years you'll have more clients you'll have more portfolios they'll show your work and people are going to want to work with you people are going to be talking about you through referrals and could build up your client base like that little by little but it is a longterm process that's not easy but you can do it yeah now how about fulltime fulltime well if you have a nice uh if you work at a big tech company you're probably surrounded or what are you gonna put that your paycheck uh yeah you could do steady paycheck yeah your paycheck nice benefits all the cool stuff that those give you right yesterday paycheck amazing benefits right i think the cool thing is amazing people right because yeah if you work at google you can be next to amazing software engineers they're going to be sitting right next to you right yes you're going to get to learn from them you're going to get to work with them and they're going to be the ones that get to review your coding you're going to get to review their coding your skills are just going to blast off after yeah so you get to have many mentors right because as a freelancer you're kind of working more so by yourself that's the issue right you're kind of there you know it's more by yourself you have to figure it out you have to be the man you have to be the project manager project manager the client manager the developer you've got like 10 different hats right um while with a photo you kind of get to focus a little more right in your case just being a developer and that's kind of for some for a lot of people that's a big benefit huge benefit right they don't want to focus on all these different things right they just want to focus on one thing which is becoming a developer and learning the most skills exactly and that's what comes down to you being selfaware of what you want to do and what will make you happy when you're working yes correct so let us know in the comments below guys what do you think you want to be freelance or fulltime or even both yeah here's the thing i did both i did both right i did both right there's nothing wrong with doing that i actually i started out yes i did start out initially with i started out with full time correct i tried that i liked it there are some things that i didn't like but and i want to try freelancing and then i went to freelancing it's as simple as that guys that's pretty much it right as you develop the skill you're gonna have more options on what you want to do yes exactly and as i said guys you will be able to go ahead as you keep going you will be able to yourself figure out okay what do i do what do i watch right um what do i learn and so forth and you just be able to kind of you know pave your own path if your own path okay cool awesome moving on so let's break it down let's break it down guys what i need you to do right now is go to the next slide now is dance okay nevermind no no not not yet we'll dance later forget about everything we just talked about forget about your goals because those are nice those are amazing those can fuel you but what you need to do is you need to make sure you focus on the process and you're doing the small steps that are going to take you and get you closer to there because it's nice to think about the 5k a month yeah it's nice to think about the tesla on your driveway but if you're thinking about those things you're not going to enjoy the process and the steps that you have to do to be able to get there correct yes the process is always one of the most important things and just enjoying what you do like you know do you enjoy what you do i enjoy what i do do i enjoy what i do definitely nas enjoys what i love what i do i get to teach you guys and we get to dance and we get to dance like it's the best job in the world you know what i mean ever and so that came first before anything else and that is what brought everything else exactly so let's break this process down for you guys what are the five stages of making a hundred thousand dollars a year nas so your first stage is earning what your first what your first ten to a hundred dollars so how might this come about that might tell me well there's different ways but first if you get to this point congratulations yes because this is huge people downplayed but this is so cool like someone paid you 10. you just did it ten dollars for what for your knowledge so way that this is possible especially if you're starting off is through tutoring right because when you're tutoring you don't have to become a full master of javascript or whatever it is that you're going to tutor you just have to be two steps ahead of the person and someone would be willing to pay for an hour of your time correct to be able to get to that by the way guys really quick if somebody is asking when will we announce the winners most likely we'll announce the winners on sunday so make sure you are there in the webinar guys really important case click the link below the description for the webinar that's when we will announce the winners okay really really really important okay so stay tuned for that cool awesome all right let's go ahead and keep going all right so next thing after you've done that what else is next tell me now you're gonna try to bump that up and try to get to your first thousand dollars per month yes right now again i do also want to add the caveat we're gonna dive deeper into probably more of the freelancing route in this case because if you do go the job route it would take a different path but we're also going to dive deep into that once we talk about the freelancing path so make sure you're paying attention to this right then once you get to 1000 you're maybe potentially looking at five to ten thousand dollars per month which is that is you're ready that's it you're in a career path you're growing you are pretty probably very happy with what you're making and you're just loving what you do and you're loving use the money that you have exactly and then now being consistent step four is you're able to do that for a whole year so that you make that 5k per year and then step five is you just build on those skills investing yourself invest in mentors go to conferences and get to the hundred thousand dollars per year correct correct correct okay let's go and focus that that camera right there beautiful thank you all right it's fine okay cool awesome so guys you can see the breakdown is pretty simple right right here right just i mean i know it's it's kind of like simple it's like what the heck i mean but let's go a little bit deeper okay so when you go ahead and start out with kind of um you know learning right there's we like to call this the pyramid of wealth right the modern javascript developer pyramid of wealth it's a simple simple process that you can just simply follow and well let's check it out so initially when you start out what's going to happen daniel when you start out you just have to learn the right skill sets you have to pick out something start learning at it start to master those things or start the process of mastering those things it's probably going to suck a little bit but that's how you start with everything right of course you have to suck a little bit initially to learn we all sucked yeah we all did too yeah i did not know how to write an html tag yeah you know i mean i didn't even know what ram was on the computer when i first started i didn't know what a semicolon was perfect you know what i mean so you kind of you can start out with that awesome so initially of course guys you have to start out with just simply learning so you learn what you need to learn right knowledge is one of the most valuable things you can have yo victor diaz just dropped a 20 donation victory thank you so much man he says my total respect for you giving all the wisdom away for free you guys rock thank you victor you rock man thank you so much thank you everyone who supports and loves this community yeah you guys are amazing whoa thank you i mean that's what's a semicolon don't worry that was knowledge when he started too awesome all right let's keep going guys cool so that was part one right it's always learned right that's that's part one you wanna always get the skills first once you get the skills then you potentially coach right so you can coach other people at this point now now as a coach what can you expect to be coaching tell me you're probably going to want to coach what you just learned right so as you dove into javascript then you're going to want to teach people how to start to use javascript how do they write a function how do they make a class how do they do anything right right and so the thing is the really cool part about this is that you can actually coach others you don't have to be a pro with your coach you see what i mean so like for example if you think about this right let's say this is a timeline and let's say this right here is one two three four and so on these are levels like this is one level one level two level three level four right and when you start out guys you start out where you start out with this level right here level one okay yes sir level one this is you you know the zip nada you're learning how to make a variable zip like you know nothing right level two maybe you know basics right so you know basics at some point right that's basics well check this out because you're here level two who do you think could teach now at this point tell me you could teach the people in the levels under you so people in level one exactly you're suitable to help them out to get to where you're at which is level exactly guys we literally have students who want this through this reaction challenge they apply the same techniques we told them here and they literally started to earn money in the in in the next week or two as a coach as a coach teaching other people is one great example he was coaching literally within a week by the sunday webinar in the last challenge he has already earned earned more than a hundred dollars oh my god that is amazing so you got past level one basically yeah now yeah level three maybe you know some projects right so maybe you build some projects you have some good confidence right so you know you know that at this point what can you teach do you think you could teach level one and now you're here you can teach this and you can teach this also right exactly the possibilities are endless and it goes on and on and on and on go ahead and here's the cool thing as you're teaching these things you're reinforcing what you're learning and getting i think jesse jesse says when you're teaching you get to learn it twice yeah right exactly you get to learn twice so that's probably one of the best things let's go ahead but the thing is you know you don't have to worry about level tense when you get to too good it's actually not good for like level 10 to teach all the way level one because level 10 right they are for example they might be like at this point too good like as as in they don't see from perspective of a beginner but because you see it from perspective a beginner that's where things are different and so it's actually easier for you as it began to teach other beginners you understand that exactly so don't be scared of level 10 because you're probably a better teacher yes if you're on level three or level four because you just went through that awesome so let's okay so we went to the coaching side oh sure yeah so actually what we're gonna do is we're gonna quickly go through a couple of slides to break it down to help you get to your first you know couple thousand dollars a month if you want to go down this road let's do it okay so let's talk about your stream of income in the first one or three months where you're learning javascript coding okay okay it only applies if you are working hard extremely hard guys of course really important where you know if you're not working hard and what what are you doing what are you doing i think you shouldn't be here sorry like without working hard at work you can't really get nowhere like yeah you know what i mean like yeah and the second thing is you just have to remember you want to teach a person just one or two steps behind you yes correct this exact thing that we're about to get so you can make money through teaching code let's set your hourly rate okay for example let's think about this let's say you already said you started 15 per hour that's pretty good it's awesome that's pretty good okay and especially if you for example actually in another country you still said that it's not really great yes may they be for example you're in pakistan or anywhere everywhere else that's like some besides us that's still pretty good that's really good money great money right okay so usually people we you have let's say four weekly coaching calls okay maybe you have four people you have four weekend coaching calls let's say you know you have four weekly coaching calls meaning you have one coaching call per week in one month you mean how much sixty dollars oh sixty what one per week okay got you yes yes yes yes yes yes you made 60 bucks okay that's right there that already is your one two hundred dollar income guys right there okay you already crossed your 100 one to one uh ten two hundred dollar income right there that's your first crossing point okay and all you need is just simply one person you need to find that one person that's it that's it and finally one person is actually not that hard with the amount of demand that there is right now for coding okay up next so let's talk about how we can find these students well what you just need to find is 50 to 100 qualified people yes if you just have a 5 conversion rate you'll be getting 2 to 5 students a week yes so if you think about this right so let's think about what five percent conversion rate five percent conversion conversion rate what does that mean daniel that means if you get a hundred people to talk to you five of them are gonna become clients to talk to talk talk five five are clients now how much is it how hard is it to talk to 100 people well it's really not that hard if we go to the next slide where we could show you exactly where we can find them look at this but before we even go there guys right if you think about this five let's say five our clients okay you're looking at potential income of 120 to 100 right and 300 per month now guys i just want to reemphasize this some people look at these numbers and laugh at them or say like that's not enough yeah but guys if you're getting started in the freelancing world if you're getting someone to pay you fifteen dollars for one session for you to teach for one hour for one hour for you to teach them something you are developing an incredible skill at this point that's only gonna help you to increase this further time and time again to where potentially your one hour can be worth like nauseous which is 250 yes dollars i now charge i now charge people who want to just probably do private coaching i charge 250 dollars per hour guys and that is not a joke and that's because i can show you the proof exactly that's because nas has built up the skill over time but he started somewhere he started actually he didn't even start here he started for free he told you he worked for free for an entire year and a half guys because he understands that you just need to build the skill over time so yeah 120 to 300 a month is amazing it's just nas didn't even do that i know you just need to be a little [ __ ] my my per month was zero per month that's how i started guys right there zero per month let me show you zero per month guys what and by the way guys we'll go go ahead and finish up and then we'll we'll give you a shout out zero month guys guys i think again guys i just want to show you we have one another domain donation which is amazing thank you so much the rich programmer mr frank himself ramos so much man awesome video finding great ways to make a living writing code let's go frank thank you so much for the 4.99 donation i was like 4.99 you know not five or forty nine we're going to be firefighting no i'm messing with you frank thank you so much man we appreciate your support and your love for the community man yeah always always awesome guys okay cool so now let's talk about case you've understood that it's possible and it wouldn't be cool to just make 300 extra per month like that's that's still pretty good amount of cash amazing like you could you know towards the car towards anything towards maybe not tesla but towards the regardless anything else you know what i mean amazing but where to find students now let's talk about this okay where do you find now students okay five students well there's many places guys to find people for you okay uh well if you think about funny people there's one thing to think about that's not the gary vee always says it's attention wherever there is attention guys if there's a tension that's where you go looking for it make sense good because here's the thing now where is attention facebook groups and stage number one instagram attention number two why is that intention number three right why isn't this is where you can actually apply as a teacher and just literally find clients like that take lessons another attention okay linkedin you have hundreds of people who are looking to learn to become programmers guys i'm not kidding craigslist put up your craigslist ad fiverr oh fire probably the best place to start you start out with literally five dollars that's your first starting point there's hundreds of people looking for you right but these facebook groups this is where some of our students actually found their students rishi one of the guys who was maybe even a chat but he's actually working with us right now he started off by finding people through instagram through facebook groups literally he just called cold called he went to you know what he did what'd he do he went to coding coding facebook groups like right now guys right now if you guys have time i mean still stay on this live call but find a facebook go to facebook.com and do type in javascript group like javascript for example javascript group right there right this will give you a humongous javascript of people who are interested in javascript boom right there it's so simple you go there you start helping people out you reach out to them directly you say hey i see what you're doing this is amazing it by the way if you're interested in potentially getting learning more javascript i myself am a teacher and i love to teach and would love to teach you as well again if you're interested let's get on a call literally just say that and you're done make sense makes sense and then you and then you close them exactly so i've gotten 100 people from all these different spots the next thing is over time as you build your skill you're just gonna want to learn how to increase your charges exactly right so when you first start out you might be making what you might be making what 15 per hour 15 per hour 15 per hour let me see 15 per hour right there okay that might be starting rate but again as you get better your price increases guys okay as you get better as you get more clients your price increases dramatically so you might be going from 15 per hour to now let's say at this point you might be going towards uh let me get the brush tool here you know you are going towards what 15 to 25 per hour within three months actually probably been faster like literally guys when you have your first client your second client might be 25 per hour literally right there that's what i've been told a lot of times 25 per hour your first client just to get from the door for 50 per hour your next client increase the price of 25 per hour done you're done pro tip do group coaches instead of individual coaching charge more pro clients yes so this is actually one time of the rishi we should probably talk to rishi about this because that's really cool this is what he does so so well is he started out with doing group coaching with people and so he'd be able to actually make about 2k per month or one i think 1k or 2k per month just on group coaching right you put everybody into this humongous group right and the coach all of them that's cool because you have one hour you're spending right on 10 20 different people who paid you the same amount of money that's huge man right you're making your time worth it even more i mean think about this right let's say you have 10 people on the group coaching let's say they paid you 15 per hour so it's 15 per 15 people okay they paid you how let's say 15 10 people that's 150 okay 150 let me see uh 150 bucks right guys this is real stuff 150 bucks okay for one session for one session now and you get them on a group coaching call and now one hour is how much one hour is not equal to what one hour is equal to what now 150. 150 bro guys like this just literally insane yes and guys the reason we're teaching this it doesn't matter if you want to go full time or doesn't matter if you want to go freelancing this is something that anyone can pick up as they're starting out can start to generate an extra side income while learning how to code and examine how to master exactly the skills awesome you're well on your way to making your first hundred dollars with code from there pretty much awesome so like i said we did coaching we did that your next step is what you could go into freelancing and this is the path that you want to go into again and this depends guys freelancing there's two different there's three different paths right you can do freelancing you can do things like fulltime potential right it depends on you right a lot of people will start out with full time right away before they begin to freelance so it really depends on what you can do on which you're able to keep evolve okay make sense good so we have freelance and that's part one okay now there's a freelancer that might require you a few months for you to know just a little bit because if you know zero it might be a little bit hard okay okay so we have and that's where you for example you might be making you know an income of 5k per month that's when you've got your 5k per month okay exactly and again these are just different things that you could start to learn on the side to build these different incomes as well awesome so you can make money through freelancing skills of course translate to what translate to hourly rates right there transit to income pretty simple stuff makes sense cool so you can charge more for freelancing games of course now your hourly rate might be here what 30 to 50 per hour but you might have more hours you might not be doing 40 hours or 20 hours per week let's say for example right so let's say that's 20 hours per week 20 hours per week per week how much is that per week if you make it let's say 30 30 bucks 30 uh 600 that's 600 600 per week you might be making right there right and how much is that per uh per month so now 2 000 2 000 2 400 per month and that is a pretty damn good salary i would say so and guys if you remember what nas showed you right now we said like if you're level one level two level three all the way to level ten yes once you start to get to those higher levels you can graduate from tutoring and start to pick up these contracts that might pay your hourly rate a little bit more as well yes and again this is where you guys get to build things like okay like projects websites small applications like chrome extensions wordpress sites who knows all those things this is where this is how you get started okay next up so where to find clients find clients on freelancing sites like for example there's like upwork upwork like for example freelancer freelancer right there but most importantly you know where to fight clients most importantly bro i was assuming probably in the facebook groups as well and just yes facebook groups but also also something nas did a lot what is it it's actually through people you know it's for people you know that's part one so through people you know so through connections so connections are very important here guys connections go ahead and ask friends your family ask your friends at your front hand like hey guys you but do you know anybody who needs help right but once you got that then conferences right there go to conferences meet people network this is actually how i got my first gig as a freelancer this is how i got paid my first i think i got paid nine thousand dollars for a project wow yes as my first gig so that was pretty damn good i would say so i mean i worked like my ass off for this honestly but but still right conferences one of the most important things to get the best why do you think they exist it's because of people who make money on there right so learn how to write good proposals take time to identify uh what's the code that was interesting that was not good all right take time to find identify clients potential requirements and so forth okay awesome so make your clients search for you really important guys of course you don't want to just be reaching out to clients always you want them to reach out to you as well and this is where social media comes in so so important guys okay social media right social media is they call inbound basically people find you they see that you're good and they come to you and if they come to you then what can they do what can you do they can hire you they can hire you but most importantly you can charge more you can charge more yes you can charge more so choose platforms okay you enjoy for example made that be linkedin facebook uh instagram and so forth create a good profile okay get a decent headshot okay be clean remember how you had that clean headshot of me for example why do you think i did those i paid 250 for those headshots because again if you're clean if you look good if you're clean like it or not i'm sorry it's like if you got a certain thai people will believe you more than if you're just like i don't know just random you know what i mean exactly i'm sorry you can judge me whatever you want but that's just the truth of the world okay so let's get into some tips guys that will help you to do this if you want to do so yes here we have rachel james an amazing amazing freelancer look at this profile like look how clean it is virtual assistant internet beautiful picture rachel was always amazing if she's not watching this i'm i'm gonna be sad but beautiful pictures but she brand herself amazingly look she even has her book me link over there yes right there her email right her linkedin website everything easy is it for someone who maybe has an online business to come and be like oh wow rachel this looks amazing i need to reach out like there's even a book now button right there yeah look at this right look at that guys guys like it does not get better right social media is your friend exactly so if you know what to do on social media guys it's very simple just start by documenting your journey as a developer that's why it's so important guys as you're going through this platform right as you're going through this coding you should be documenting what you're doing documenting put it in your instagram post your slackload everything you're learning put it up on there make it clean make it good that's how i got started is how do you think i found qazi through social media social media i was documenting my journey found him through that he found me through there as well we got together we decided to work together and then boom voila we're here now like it's crazy what social media does for you how do you think this guy was found i was found well yeah we found each other through social media and then at a live event at a conference at a conference conferences social media the proof is in the pudding which is right here this is the pudding right there right here right here we are putting we're at the puddings okay chocolate pudding awesome yes so even a failure so again yes guys okay document your journey even even when things go bad if you something feel you're like did this did that not work something went bad it's okay documented that too really important guys so again and let's go and create a system for finding clients okay you're ready to take on your journey become a freelancer that's crazy to find plans you ready bro let's do it how do you do it well you want to make sure as you're creating these systems you make sure that you're working on platforms like upwork and people per hour you're able to go through even some directories facebook groups slacking news but if you have this system of daily actions you could take every single day you're gonna again fall in love with the process and not the results similar to what i talked about before you kind of create like the action steps that you need to do today so you could be successful in a year from now yes correct go ahead take a note of know a piece of pen and paper guys very important guys and just list them down for yourself but we'll tell you exactly how to do it as well check this out creative system for finding clients look at this here's your system right here would you spread out your specific thing your specific like whatever might be maybe it's using spreadsheets uh you know google google slides whatever it might be trello word whatever it might be right split this up into two into six categories one natural clients okay conversations you're having with people outreach emails called booked right with people followup and client right so this is the stepbystep process to get from someone from potential clients to becoming a full client right there make sense okay create this for yourself make sure you you keep track of everything that you're doing as you're talking to people at conferences as you're talking people through facebook groups keep track of it okay don't just let it kind of hang there very important all right cool awesome it's gonna keep going and of course go to conferences you guys know the importance of this at this point right here like this what conference is this daniel this uh i'm actually not quite sure google google a conference oh yeah google conference actually my friend went there once dope isn't this the ceo of microsoft no google yeah but that guy that google specific presenter he's the ceo of google google yeah right yeah i don't know yeah yeah he's the ceo cool yeah yeah i forgot what his name was but uh yeah seo google that's correct yeah yeah so this is at google i o i think is the yeah sander sunder i don't know how to say that [Laughter] i'm sorry but apparently he's the boss so we listen to the boss okay and mish again blaka what i literally do guys because of course we talk with a lot of students as well right uh for you know our programs right and so forth like that i have booked out for example every single morning between 9 a.m to 12 p.m pc guys is where i have calls as well so for example for you guys you can do the same thing right lock out your calendar time daily where you do call maybe it's 8 amp pst to 12 pm pst where you do follow up look for new opportunities to add and place it to meet new potential new people for example wanna create a place great place to meet new people is nowhere let me show you meetups.com meetups.com amazing place oh that's not okay never mind hold on i don't know what happened there do we have do we have internet i think god i think yeah we're good yeah i'm doing meetups right there so meet up oh it's meetup.com my bad meetup.com so literally go ahead like for example taipan uh let me just think about this camera yes we're coming to beverly hills we'll say have encoding or let's just say uh yeah let's say coding for example okay right there right ladies learn code developer show and tell right this is where you meet people this is where you meet people around write coding and so forth but let's say for example you want to do more business type business type things for example maybe you want to do app development for example app development development who knew right app development right video game for example tutorial right developer show and tell all these different things is where lightning talks for example see tech happy hour right there look at this beautiful go somewhere like this this is a tech happy hour right find people around this is a hacker dojo the public group guys get into this meet people right very important and that's pretty much it and this is how you get to network and this is how you get clients it's just you know i mean it's not simple of course but it's doable all right let's go ahead and do this next step guys we are currently at 254 lives can we get to 400 likes let's go let's go okay good that's a change a good change in pace all right so how to find a job now how do you make money through a job that's a question okay hi my three job well again to find a job you want to look for opportunities for different places like linkedin like you know your favorite companies like india and so forth write a nice resume i will and the rice resident may mean clean resume okay a clean resume please a clean resume okay yours needs to be clean you might have a header at the top that says your name you have your this part might be your experiences or your projects next part might be your experiences and find the last part might be your references right here okay so guys go ahead and i just wanted to add guys what you'll notice is everything we talked about is universal if you want to be a freelancer or if you want to get a job all these things apply you could make money tutoring and helping people learning how to program you could find the right networks at conferences like even if you're looking for a job there's probably recruiters are going to be there's gonna be other software engineers of big tech companies that are like the google io conference right if you schedule your time properly if you schedule daily actions whether it's like hey i gotta learn how to code this stuff or hey i gotta reach out to these people you're gonna be successful so everything we've talked about here is gonna apply to you whether you're trying to make six figures as a freelancer or through a fulltime job exactly and really important i just i kind of thought about this one amazing way to find people as well is actually nowhere hackathons oh that is huge yeah networking opportunity amazing networking opportunity guys this is where you find people who are not only developers but potential startup companies who want to hire you for example uh businesses freelancers right people this is the probably on the best networking solutions like for you honestly find a hackathon near you and go there dina one of our students is one to a hackathon want the hackathon and guess what she now has a job as a react.js developer amazing like done you know what i mean and by the way we just got a great question now that i think you're gonna like they said how do we address not having any experience or any relevant experience on a resume well if you don't experience then what you have is pretty simple guys what you have is something called projects guys this is where you put down your projects okay everything that you've done right so for example you see how this section right here this blue section this blue section is only mainly for projects this is the only way we will showcase people that hey this is what i can do this is what i did that's what i left to do so what is a great example of a project i mean what do you think well definitely what we did in the past three days we were able to build an amazing slack clone these are the projects that you could start to learn and you can put on your portfolio exactly so slack clone maybe like for example whatsapp clone but really important guys is don't just build them and copy them i would say build them but also add your own features right add your own features right and then once you're adding your own features can i give you a really small piece of advice this is what our students this is what our students at pwg do they build what they have in our course and then they rebuild it by themselves by themselves again again by themselves fully man fully by themselves that is how you're actually learning it yeah they don't watch the video they don't watch the tutorial know nothing they just rebuild it this is how you probably will learn the most and so you put that on your portfolio you put that on your projects and that's how people see you put yourself out on social media and you should you will you will get the opportunity that you want okay up next okay let's go and move on so really quickly guys as you said uh write a cover letter prepare your interview guys do mock interviews with your friends right around you don't just go into an interview just being fully blank do mock interviews with people around you and negotiate yourself this is gonna happen probably later on when you first get the interview or when you actually get the job so don't worry about this part so much right now this is not the most important part your most important part is just to get the job yes so guys this is the road map to become a web developer specifically a six figure developer because if we look at how much a web developer makes on average you'll notice that it's above six figures right especially if you just go on indeed or anywhere you can look up these jobs with front of developer react js javascript developer what we just learned in these last couple days and this road map that we built out for you guys could be either through just doing your own thing trying to be a freelancer trying to find a fulltime job as we showed you the tips you want to do or even both at the same time guys now this opportunity is amazing right now like i mean it's so amazing guys i mean if you go for example to indeed.com guys indeed.com okay let's just think about this let's say you type in javascript java uh let's just say javascript javascript right there right and i mean you're looking for sony opportunities potentially right there it's it's insane so let's go and find jobs right now so technical project lead right there right senior foster developer full stack node.js javascript developer right there right there easy apply right so remote jobs and that's the cool part right now guys is a lot of these are remote by the way nas how many responses did we just get on this how many results did we just get on this and what on this search scroll up to the top 61 000 jobs are available right now 61 000 jobs that scared me dude 61 000 jobs guys are available right now indeed and you type in javascript right there you have 61 000 opportunities and guess what next week there's probably gonna be tens of thousands more opportunities yes they're just always coming in and always growing i literally when i when i researched this like literally two months ago when we did a top five program languages video on youtube it was 50 000 jobs and it's just growing this was only two months ago this is now 61 000 jobs and the crazy thing is it's only 10 000 more a lot of those are probably new so it's probably like 40 000. look at this guys also developer urgently hiring easy apply 100 to 130k per year they want to throw money at you right now they're just grabbing the money and throwing it at you if you have the skills yes yes now granted i'm not gonna like [ __ ] you saying that you're gonna be making this right away okay you need to learn things like for example right aws my javascript look at this javascript look at this right there boom boom right bro look at this it's good it's come from awesome just react okay now again and just to be mindful you don't have to know everything in ten hun here you need to know at least one thing that's on here okay a lot of these job postings that will have aws they have like 20 different technologies they're just doing it to screw you off the purpose of that is to scare people off who are not capable of learning something like this that's the whole goal so when you see something like this and you're like okay well i don't know this i don't know this i know this i know a little of this me but i don't know this it's okay still apply you literally you will not be hurt if you just simply apply guys okay you will not be hurt at all the only thing you're doing is just spending more time exactly guys you know what i mean awesome so let's go ahead and again you will not be making this this amount of money right away it might take you some time but you might be looking at making you know 70 80k yeah per year depending exactly there's nothing wrong with starting at that 60 000 year and building up to this over time yes because again if this is something that you're trying to do if you're trying to do a career transition or this is the first career trying to start yeah this is a lifelong process it's a lifelong process if you can earn 60 000 the next year 70 80 and it takes you a couple years to get to the six figures but then for the rest of your life the next 20 to 30 years you're gonna be earning six figures is that not worth it it's all worth it man it's so worth it guys most of all just enjoy the process please love what you do be positive the world is amazing the world is great as long as you make it that way like it's so simple i i can't make it anywhere else right you know if a lot of you guys you might be struggling i understand you're always struggle maybe you have a career that you don't like maybe you know and so forth but that's okay listen there is a bright side at the end of this you just have to take the right strategies you have to take the right initiative and say that's it i am done i'm ready to move on it's behind me now let's just keep going forward i will work hard because i want a better living for myself that's it exactly guys i mean nods couldn't have said it better so now what we want to tell you guys is how you could take it a step further we

cues and trees well that's a good question it's actually something we do in our program yes that is a great talk about it for a second yeah we should definitely talk about it so this is a great question because very often i remember when i was in university yes we would do all these crazy algorithm data structures but i never really saw a purpose to them and it wasn't until when i got to the interview questions where they kind of added a purpose to it right yeah so a specific one was when i was google when i was interviewing with google they asked me hey i want you to create an autocomplete so imagine you have a search bar you're typing something in and then there's an auto complete that comes out from that what are you gonna do i was like oh my god what am i gonna do so i like start trying to think of these solutions and i ended up coming and modeling a solution that i didn't know about but it's called the try right and what this try is it's a form of a tree that allows you to search through basically different words that you put into the tree structure and it optimizes it so it doesn't take too long especially if you have millions of words inside of the tree yeah it's really cool it's something we do with our students sorry yeah so i'll just say well now he's going to say while he finishes chewing and drinking but this is what we decided we're like guys let's take this project and put it into our full stack mastery bootcamp yes guys yes and that is one of the projects out one of the hundreds of projects they're gonna build because these are the things that you have to build and learn so you understand them and you understand how they work and how they're applicable it's so much fun and because you get to apply the real world the scenario of something like this you get to learn so much and of course guys these are really it's a meal great question by the way it's a really important topic that you you guys need to focus on okay stop working so much and just being fancy with all your projects do the projects yes but also focus on the fundamentals and the basics focus on those i cannot stress this enough if you don't focus on fundamentals and the basics which by the way is something we focus on very much in pwj and focus mastery as well you will not get the job i'm sorry because when you go to the job what do you think they're testing you for it's pretty simple they are testing you for your problem solving skills and your algorithm skills that's it they're not going to ask you hey can you write me for example a react.js component app or whatever might be right the com the reality is apps is what gets you to the interview right that's your portfolio they see it it's nice okay interesting person let's talk to them when you talk to them they're going to talk to you about what your fundamentals your problem solving how good are you at being able to step outside the box and find a solution to a problem he's really good at finding social to a problem like too good i'm mad at him sometimes yeah literally you know what i mean so that's just one example right so please follow this so yes muslim that's a great question so try is one great another one another one might be for example uh um undo for example um the undo section for example when you do undo that actually has to do with stacks you have to create two stacks the the undo functionality on your computer on like a text editor or anything like that yes exactly so that hopefully that answers your question so before we dive into the questions we also forgot to mention guys there's one final homework assignment for you guys yes what is it we need you to we're gonna send you guys a link to a questionnaire so that we can help you to get closer and build that road map for you guys so i'm on it if you're here i don't know if you could just drop the link in the chat box in the youtube one if not just send them my way and i could also drop it in there but make sure you hit that link and do that homework assignment there's a couple of questions that we have for you they're going to help say he said anyway here let me see um i saw

you have to worry about right now is you hit you have to be in the webinar so click the link below down right there register for the webinar really important how to make how to become a reactor

respect that you have to because this has the possibility to honestly be a game changer for your life a career path switcher everything okay somebody asked how do i join the discord channel well to don't join this channel you have to join the react gs challenge do we have it the link down below uh maybe we have it in the description let me double check let me see how'd you discontinue this channel is if you join the react.js challenge that's where you should see it okay no we don't have it look on day three day three or day four like for example last day or day four there's a link on the youtube video to join the reactions challenge ibrahim okay it is there trust me uh join the challenge and there once you join you will have the opportunity to join the discord group okay it's as simple as that awesome so guys drop your questions again i know we already missed a couple questions we went deep into one of the answers just drop your questions again there's so many great questions and let's just answer a couple more links to the webinar guys by the way down description below under youtube it's under the description it's pinned there yes it's there you should see it under youtube description it's there a lot of you guys are asking saying yes yes yes i got it i got it registered amanda and my dev is registered that's amazing yes yes yes that's so good guys if you went ahead and registered let us know in the comments below really important can we get likes to 300 oh we're 289 bro 289 likes can we get there bro i think we can i think we can are you guys ready guys come on 289 likes can we get to 300 likes and we'll make sure oh man we're ready 290 200 likes what how often oh one second one second one time are we getting to 300 what are we doing 300 likes hold

and do the thing hold on hey so question guys question how often will there will they do bonus training for you in a situation just like that so she's she's referring to if you apply to a job that wants you to have like aws php like all these different things yeah like and you only have one or two of those five requested they will give you the all the training they need because they are investing in you yes it is good for them it is good for them to invest in you because they want to keep you there for a long time and so for them you your value is a lot more than what they're paying you exactly you see what i mean and so they will invest you they will keep the trade necessary because if you're already there there you put the energy dirty put the time into you yeah at this point all you need to do is just put in no some more knowledge to you that's it they're already committing 60 70 80 100 000 a year to you they'll be more than happy to train you with whatever they need hey so adrian i hope that answers your question because in reality that stops a lot of people from applying but don't let it stop you oh my god one of our students from the full stack mastery boot camp just donated 15 thank you so much on but then he says when is the hexa that's good and um you know the you know the answer that on i'm sure you know accessible come on i'm not saying the number no i am not saying that number it's a special number for us in the community all right fine it's 50 oh yeah i also realized he also donated 15 dollars yeah i didn't get that part at first oh let's go on where's this question coming from oh my god that's amazing that's funny that's all 15. but wait yes the what's happening well of f that is 15 yes guys yes it is let's go oh god that's so funny though oh my gosh that's actually a really big thing that we have in our first time mastery we have a we have a lot of fun just in pwg and it feels like mastery course everywhere it's amazing we enjoy it we enjoy it so much this is why we get to do what we do is because again a lot of it because of you guys you guys are amazing thank you all so much for being such amazing students and just amazing people in general uh like always love you all so much uh cool how to name your robot friday what does that make sense huh what is that question let me see i don't know five more we get the dance oh look at this five more we get to dance i don't know what she's talking about we already danced what are these guys we already did that's already happened uh i'm having entirely too much fun with you people we're having too much fun with you that's good to hear okay any more questions guys so sharier asked um how any tips on how to improve data structures and algorithm skills where uh probably just a couple more up oh my gosh are you the most up to date yeah it is all right it wasn't that far up what web app do you think i have to build to impress potential employees with react gs well for one i mean the slack loan here that you just built is amazing so make sure it's clean and make sure it's nice that's part one um yeah i mean it's pretty much any big project that that includes a lot of you know different parts so like for example react gs for example my includes components right style components right anything that may be a little more difficult than just normal that should be always your goal right and you don't just want to do just like for example you know one project do a few projects do a project with one page for example a full stack app with slot clone right include login right that's a big thing that people look for is can you can you put a login functionality right maybe from scratch even and so forth right can you do that um that's always something you want to look for is what features can i include in a project so login logout right maybe live time chat application more pages for example maybe for slack loan guys one thing you can add is a profile page so when you click on your profile you can actually view your own profile so that's one thing i recommend for you guys that's a really big thing that you know that a lot of employers might like right so that's one thing you might want to add and that could be bonus points for you for you'll be able to win the 15k full stack mastery boot camp of course awesome all right let's see any other questions i'll take just a couple more guys drop them below drop the fire nozz beginners then mike tyson come with coding oh you know it hi tyson let's go we're gonna miss you guys we're gonna miss you guys as well guys but we're not done yet guys sunday sunday sunday sunday sunday i want to see you guys on sunday everybody should have joined this sunday guys really really important learn the basics on the fundamentals i guess basics and fundamentals so uh that that means algorithms so go to high current lead code learn the algorithms learn how to for example build a binary search tree how to for example go ahead and uh you know stacks cues how to do linked lists all those things you need to learn those really important okay guys and after you learn them how do you get better at data structures how do you get better at algorithms practice practice yes practice just like anything else implement them build cool projects practice more build cool projects hacker rank click code all

all together all right let's see what else we got i joined david nice ama amazing let's go good okay this is why you guys such a good team thank you so much i put in my calendar let's go christian it's a good question okay that's a good question here what do you think is it valuable to learn how to sort data structures without the use of methods methods yeah i think it's important to at least know the fastest most optimal ways of is it sorting or yeah of sorting a specific data structure like an array right so in this case if you're going to be doing sorting you could either learn quick sort or merge sort those have both the same big o notation of n login which is the most optimal for sorting you just have to know one of those yes i mean you also can know that you can have a dot sort function that helps you out and does it for you but if you just know the implementation you at least understand how the inner workings of the dot sort function work you don't have to go crazy you don't have to go learn bubble sort and all these other ones but as long as you know the important ones yes and again guys let me just jump back to here really quickly here the link down below will be
