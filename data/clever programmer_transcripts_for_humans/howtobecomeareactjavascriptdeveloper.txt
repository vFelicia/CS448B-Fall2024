01:36 - lot more just by hearing those
01:39 - stories and our goal is that hopefully
01:41 - they're inspiring to you
01:42 - hopefully they move you and hopefully
01:46 - they inspire you to become a better
01:48 - developer
01:50 - and show you how you can do it too and
01:52 - how you can land those jobs
01:54 - or clients or make an income with coding
01:56 - things like that does that make sense

02:00 - ahead and um
02:02 - invite our boy sunny
02:06 - so let's see i really hope the audio

02:59 - nelson what's up it's um good to see you
03:02 - again frank
03:04 - no hold on hold on that's fine it's just
03:06 - just when i put this on there's echo
03:08 - so i don't want that yeah this allows me
03:10 - to hear him but then there's echo
03:12 - so i would rather not i would rather
03:15 - hear him without the
03:17 - echo i know all of you guys can hear him
03:19 - clearly and you guys could hear
03:21 - me clearly as well which i think is
03:23 - fantastic
03:24 - the only problem is when i'm listening
03:26 - to it i'm hearing an echo if i turn
03:29 - sunny no no no i
03:32 - i don't think you're understanding me
03:33 - nas
03:35 - it's my audio that's making me here i
03:37 - know people don't hear it
03:42 - oh [ __ ] yeah i can hear the double okay
03:45 - so maybe
03:46 - if you guys have uh frankie can i get
03:48 - your airpods and maybe that
03:50 - allows me to listen to sunny
03:54 - really weird errors that we get into
03:56 - sometimes guys but that's okay
03:58 - it's part of it's part of our process as
04:02 - part of the debugging that we always
04:03 - have to do
04:04 - exactly i think we go pretty good now i
04:06 - want to connect them to your computer
04:08 - are they connected to your computer with

05:06 - is we are going to be learning through
05:07 - other people's stories as well
05:09 - and seeing what they have achieved and
05:12 - what they have accomplished and i think

05:15 - give you guys a lot of context around it
05:19 - exactly all right so if we want to start
05:22 - bringing people on nas
05:24 - frankie if you guys can just go ahead

09:39 - can click and and these get upvoted and
09:41 - sort of ranked and that's a really good
09:42 - way of asking a question because it goes
09:44 - ahead and shows us
09:45 - what people want to ask or you can go
09:46 - ahead and just pop it in a comment just
09:47 - remember the comment section is going
09:49 - quite crazy right now

09:51 - that
09:53 - um okay nice now guys time to focus

10:57 - the community what was it that brought
10:58 - you to pwj let us know let everyone know
11:01 - um
11:01 - i lost my job because of covid um
11:04 - and i decided to try programming
11:08 - and i signed up for a college class and
11:12 - i
11:12 - sucked at it so i went to youtube and
11:16 - found quasi
11:17 - and uh he helped me actually pass that
11:19 - college class
11:20 - um but then i found out he has like
11:23 - y'all created your own program so
11:25 - i joined like right away like i think i
11:28 - watched that youtube for
11:30 - 20 minutes and then i was like wait i
11:32 - need to just join
11:34 - i'm like i bet i could learn better if i
11:36 - just joined this class so i didn't even
11:38 - finish that youtube
11:40 - yeah awesome nice and how do you how
11:42 - have you find your experience because
11:44 - because somebody who's new to pwj yeah i
11:46 - think everybody
11:47 - will be excited to find out i'm totally
11:49 - new to programming and i will say
11:51 - it has helped a ton because getting into
11:54 - the community of people who actually
11:55 - know what they're doing
11:57 - um has really helped in fact we've
12:00 - started a mini group out like
12:02 - of people i just met in pwj and we're
12:05 - working on y'all's projects that we
12:07 - found on youtube like the spotify the
12:08 - netflix
12:10 - like because i couldn't keep ups because
12:12 - i'm way new like i can barely even type
12:16 - um so like just like getting that group
12:19 - of friends and just having a group of
12:21 - friends who
12:22 - know like a little more than me some
12:25 - actually know less and we just kind of
12:26 - help each other out it's amazing
12:28 - and then just getting on all y'all's
12:30 - coaching calls has like
12:32 - made me go from like knowing nothing to
12:35 - i know some now
12:36 - i'm getting there that's it like that's
12:39 - what we aim for is to build that sort of
12:40 - confidence and like she said guys
12:42 - we have communities inside of the
12:44 - community which is insane like i love
12:46 - that i really love that and um
12:48 - how do you find that's helped you out
12:49 - and helped you build your confidence
12:52 - like i'm one of those people that gets
12:53 - frustrated really really really easily
12:56 - but just having like 100 friends or be
12:59 - like girl you can do this come on like
13:00 - i'll
13:01 - jump on zoom i'll show you how to do it
13:03 - like it's just made me not get
13:05 - especially i'm just like hey let's solve
13:06 - this problem
13:07 - so that's awesome nice
13:13 - cause yeah i think you're mike's muted
13:15 - yeah i can't hear him at all yeah
13:17 - we can't hear you oh how about now now
13:20 - you're good
13:21 - there we go damn okay i was like damn i
13:24 - can hear myself but i had muted myself
13:26 - in there
13:27 - that is so amazing that somebody from
13:29 - the community will actually jump
13:31 - on a call with you i think that's one of
13:33 - those things that makes
13:34 - all the difference in the world there
13:36 - are programs that i am in and where i'm
13:38 - trying to learn
13:38 - like more about business and how to grow
13:41 - business and how to help people
13:42 - and even they will never actually get on
13:45 - calls with you or
13:46 - the peers and if a peer can get on a
13:48 - call with me i feel like that just takes
13:50 - everything that i'm doing to the next
13:52 - level so that's really cool
13:55 - i would suggest if you are gonna join us
13:57 - also download zoom
14:00 - because that screen sharing button is
14:02 - amazing
14:03 - right now exactly zoom skills yeah and
14:06 - screen brush is another good one we use
14:08 - uh which
14:09 - which might be handy for you to use oh
14:10 - yeah that's awesome you just roll over
14:12 - the screen
14:13 - oh yes green brush is really cool so
14:15 - melissa before we move on because we
14:16 - have more people lined up
14:18 - if somebody is on the fence would you
14:20 - recommend this
14:21 - course to other people now that you've
14:23 - had especially some chance to go through
14:25 - it oh my gosh yes anybody and everybody
14:29 - this class makes it so much easier even
14:31 - if you want to take like a different
14:32 - class because your friends are doing it
14:34 - join this one too
14:35 - because then you have friends to help
14:36 - you with that one nice
14:38 - because i'm the one that like joined
14:40 - like five different programs
14:42 - like don't do that but yeah
14:45 - nice but like yeah like just having the
14:48 - community and then being able to go
14:49 - through like the modules at your own
14:51 - course like
14:52 - you might hear like you need to hurry
14:53 - through them no like actually go through
14:55 - them and learn them that has actually
14:56 - helped me so much
14:58 - just being able to learn it at my own
15:00 - pace and not have a professor be like
15:02 - you got to learn it right now and i'm
15:03 - like
15:04 - you know and then like
15:08 - like i don't know like uh like having
15:10 - all the community rooms
15:12 - like if i'm stuck on this i can go to
15:13 - this room and be like hey and all these
15:15 - people
15:16 - know about it like that has helped
15:17 - tremendously like just knowing which
15:19 - group to talk to
15:21 - yeah we actually introduced module rooms
15:22 - so you've got module one two three and
15:24 - then them rooms are pretty good
15:25 - a lot of students found that was really
15:26 - useful so yeah that's awesome
15:28 - nice thank you so much melissa for
15:30 - coming on really appreciate you thank
15:32 - you
15:33 - thank you so much man i keep hitting

15:40 - to also do is i want to bring on some
15:42 - people who also maybe aren't in profit
15:44 - with javascript but you have some
15:46 - questions you want to ask
15:47 - i want to address your guys's question
15:49 - on the call so i invited two people
15:51 - right now
15:52 - ken and i think
15:55 - one more person at the top so
16:00 - somebody asks what are the classes and
16:02 - how are they scheduled tenzing asks
16:05 - so when it comes to the classes guys
16:06 - there this course is pre-recorded
16:08 - with trainings which means you can take
16:11 - it at your own
16:12 - pace even if you're a complete beginner
16:14 - you can take it at your own pace and be
16:16 - fine
16:17 - even the live three live coaching calls
16:19 - that we do every single week
16:20 - you can take that at your own pace as
16:22 - well meaning like they're pre-recorded
16:26 - they get recorded afterwards and we'll
16:27 - put them in the module so you can
16:29 - take them then at your own pace or if
16:31 - you can make it to the live call
16:32 - that's even better you'll get a better
16:34 - experience exactly

17:35 - few people is
17:36 - if you pay with paypal people actually
17:39 - offer six month financing i think with
17:41 - paypal credit if it's available in your
17:43 - in your area so
17:44 - that's something that actually might be
17:45 - quite useful and zero percent
17:47 - so that's really useful yeah
17:50 - that's definitely gonna be and what was
17:52 - it that made you sort of
17:53 - uh on what was it that got you
17:55 - interested in profit with javascript
17:57 - oh yes well for years i would have been
17:59 - a sql developer
18:01 - i got that job a long time ago and i
18:03 - couldn't get it back
18:04 - right so i was like let's try something
18:06 - different
18:07 - okay i'm trying to ignore javascript for
18:09 - the longest because i believe it wasn't
18:10 - no money in it
18:12 - yeah until i saw you guys nice
18:15 - awesome dude and uh so a few things i'd
18:18 - like to ask what's your why
18:19 - and why do you think pwj is going to
18:21 - help you or why is it going to help you
18:23 - get to that why all right well right now
18:26 - i'm disabled
18:28 - okay because i lost that job
18:31 - because i was disabled right yeah
18:33 - because i couldn't go to work
18:34 - right and i figured that if i can work
18:36 - from home
18:37 - and like program on my own make my own
18:41 - money
18:42 - i'm not be worried about being fired
18:44 - from a job because i'm disabled now yeah
18:46 - right damn bro yeah
18:49 - damn it so that's a good reason to be in
18:52 - this program
18:53 - and bro we definitely got your back just
18:56 - most important thing
18:57 - is when you're in this program like are
19:00 - you able to put in between 10 to 40
19:02 - hours a week
19:03 - yes i am okay the more time you can put
19:07 - in
19:08 - the better the results you're gonna get
19:10 - and in the shorter
19:11 - time frame you're gonna get them because
19:13 - like i've said even on the instagram
19:15 - yesterday i just posted this because i
19:16 - was like i feel like some people are
19:18 - starting to get this idea that it's a
19:19 - magic pill
19:20 - and it isn't it requires a tremendous
19:22 - amount of hard work
19:24 - and there's a lot of failure you have to
19:25 - go through but the students that succeed
19:27 - in the program are the ones who
19:29 - keep failing keep trying new things
19:32 - never stop get help from the community
19:36 - use the courses reference material build
19:38 - projects
19:39 - keep trying and then that cycle of that
19:42 - work
19:43 - build reach out work build reach up like
19:47 - non-stop cycle
19:49 - that's what creates those
19:50 - disproportionate results for them over
19:52 - time
19:53 - okay this sounds good i did for sticker
19:55 - once
19:56 - yeah yeah i learned oracle and
20:00 - the one from microsoft sql server right
20:03 - got you yeah
20:04 - because even even in those coaching
20:06 - calls that we pretty much exactly what
20:07 - cars you play that's what we like always
20:08 - try and instill
20:10 - like it's like guys like we said like
20:12 - it's not always like a course isn't
20:13 - going to be the magic pill
20:15 - that's going to transform your life what
20:17 - the course is offering is a community
20:19 - like a space
20:20 - for you to really flourish and sort of
20:22 - grow right and we sort of help you
20:24 - we provide you like with the guidelines
20:26 - and then we provide the content on top
20:28 - of that
20:29 - right so it's a lot more than just like
20:31 - material inside of a course that's why
20:34 - i really don't see like much benefit in
20:36 - like a lot of udemy courses because
20:38 - most of the time i would end up having a
20:39 - like a question
20:41 - i want to ask or like you know you're
20:43 - gonna have some kind of like
20:44 - some kind of thing which you're
20:45 - interested in but you have no idea like
20:47 - how to even ask the question to begin
20:48 - with
20:48 - and i guarantee if you go ahead and ask
20:50 - somebody on on udemy you're not going to
20:52 - get a reply
20:52 - right like this yeah it's going to be a
20:55 - huge while right
20:58 - yes so there you go man like i'm happy
21:01 - for you to jump in the program i'm
21:03 - pumped for you thank you so much for
21:04 - coming on ken
21:05 - you're welcome again appreciate you dude
21:08 - appreciate it
21:08 - all right and join the join the program
21:12 - uh and if you join it during this time
21:14 - we sonny and i definitely want to get on
21:15 - a coaching call with you okay
21:17 - okay thank you so much i really
21:19 - appreciate it awesome dude i'll see you
21:20 - in the program again
21:23 - um i gotta get better on my timing i
21:25 - swear to god yo srikar how are you doing
21:27 - what's up hey i can't hear you can you
21:31 - hear me
21:32 - yeah yeah we can hear you
21:35 - all good see if we can uh get your mic
21:38 - figured out
21:39 - but srikar was in the chat and he was
21:41 - like yo guys pwj is the best community
21:44 - that helps people with any debugging
21:45 - issues they have a great curriculum
21:47 - and has given many jobs what are you
21:48 - waiting for and guys
21:50 - when it comes to getting jobs or getting
21:53 - work or getting clients
21:54 - i just want to emphasize that you have
21:58 - to enjoy coding if you are
22:01 - doing something else and you only see it
22:03 - as a vehicle to your freedom
22:05 - and making money do
22:08 - don't go towards coding they're a lot
22:11 - easier and better ways to make money
22:14 - like if that's your primary goal
22:15 - i would say like learn business like
22:18 - learn how to
22:19 - sell your own things maybe like learn
22:21 - e-commerce there's tons of ways you can
22:24 - make an income that's a lot easier
22:26 - than learning coding even i watched this
22:29 - video
22:29 - i randomly came across and it was so
22:31 - random i typed in rafikaze on youtube
22:33 - because i just wanted to see like
22:36 - my personal brand video that i recently
22:37 - created right so i'm going through
22:39 - youtube
22:40 - and i see garyvee's video under rafikaze
22:44 - which was super weird
22:46 - and it says i can't code and he goes you
22:49 - can't sell crap
22:51 - and i clicked on that video and i
22:52 - started watching garyvee's video in one
22:54 - minute 40 seconds and he literally says
22:56 - i wanted to become a python developer
22:57 - but i can't oh [ __ ]
22:59 - nice yes i was like damn
23:03 - yeah because even gary vee
23:08 - sometimes you know he admits that he
23:10 - can't learn coding and it's because he
23:11 - doesn't probably enjoy it
23:13 - yeah so if you don't enjoy it don't
23:16 - force yourself to do it
23:18 - what i want you guys to go after is
23:20 - really find
23:22 - what you actually enjoy about coding is
23:25 - it the
23:25 - actual process of sitting down and
23:28 - coding is it the process
23:29 - of you writing out your ideas on a
23:31 - whiteboard and coming up with
23:33 - what you can build is it
23:37 - working with the team of people and
23:39 - coming up with
23:40 - what kind of app you guys can build and
23:42 - then breaking that apart
23:44 - down for me it was always the problem
23:47 - solving that fascinated me about coding
23:49 - and by the way guys
23:51 - the profit with javascript uh button is
23:53 - below so if you guys want to join you
23:55 - can click there
23:56 - and i do want to let you guys know that
23:58 - today is
23:59 - the last day of the price that it's at
24:02 - and then by
24:03 - tonight it's going to increase so that's
24:05 - something i want to let you guys know if
24:07 - you guys want to join it just click it
24:08 - we will see inside the program but i'm
24:10 - going to continue with what i was saying
24:11 - and for me the problem solving is
24:14 - something that's fascinating to me and i
24:16 - absolutely love which is why i really
24:18 - love chess too
24:19 - i don't know if you guys like chess but
24:21 - sonny do you play chess
24:23 - uh i mean i dabble with that i need to i
24:25 - i'll definitely have a game
24:26 - but it'll be fun yeah i'll play you
24:29 - blindfold
24:30 - minecraft let's go yeah
24:33 - so yeah with chess it allows me to go in
24:36 - this flow state and
24:37 - think for a really long period of time
24:39 - and that's what makes chess fun for me
24:41 - and for a lot of people maybe even for
24:43 - you sonny coding is fun because it
24:45 - lets you hit when you're two hours in or
24:47 - three hours in
24:48 - and you're in that flow state yeah right
24:52 - dude that flow state is something else
24:54 - and that's something which i
24:55 - like even if i would say this is my
24:57 - advice right even if you don't enjoy
24:59 - coding
24:59 - like always give something a try with
25:01 - 110 right like
25:02 - you can't say you you don't like
25:04 - something if you give it 90 i just don't
25:06 - feel like you've fully gone into it
25:07 - right
25:08 - and coding is one of those things you're
25:09 - gonna kind of hit a wall at some point
25:11 - like it's guaranteed you're gonna hit a
25:12 - wall
25:13 - and i would say i'd recommend at least
25:14 - give that wall a fair amount of time
25:17 - before you kind of say okay this isn't
25:18 - for me and like what i would say is when
25:20 - you get into that flow state guys
25:22 - that's really when you're going to
25:24 - really start
25:27 - all right yeah you guys hear dj khaled
25:29 - going another one
25:32 - did you oh no no no i didn't is that
25:34 - what you've got in your
25:35 - text message yeah every time we get a
25:37 - student to enroll in pwj
25:39 - i have dj khaled going another word like
25:41 - let's go the family grows baby
25:44 - i'm gonna i'm gonna do the same thing
25:46 - that's good
25:47 - yeah classic lip yeah just joined
25:49 - welcome to the program john
25:51 - exactly awesome dude and and remember
25:53 - like another reminder guys that this is
25:55 - today is the last time
25:56 - you will get the price that you see uh
25:58 - from this bun
25:59 - after today it goes up and we didn't lie
26:02 - last time and we're not lying today it's
26:03 - going to go up
26:04 - yeah so let's bring on other people so
26:06 - atharva what is going on my man
26:08 - talk to us about what got you into
26:12 - coding
26:12 - and what got you into profit with
26:14 - javascript and welcome
26:15 - welcome dude we spoke together nice yeah
26:18 - we spoke yeah so what brought me into
26:21 - coding like i was 10 years old and
26:23 - my brother used to learn c plus plus and
26:25 - i was like hey i want to do the same and
26:27 - i would never get his books so one day i
26:29 - just stole his book and just started
26:30 - reading
26:30 - and it was so interesting like according
26:33 - to me i just read the entire book in
26:35 - just two days and it was so
26:37 - yeah and i just started to
26:42 - do some other coding languages like
26:43 - visual basic like i didn't know that it
26:45 - was
26:45 - like outdated thing i was just into
26:47 - coding so i just started doing that
26:49 - and it was fun and like you actually
26:52 - make something and
26:54 - like you have an idea and you make it
26:55 - happen that's that's so
26:57 - important and that's so good about
26:59 - programming that you can make things
27:01 - happen
27:01 - and i just move on and i'm now 19 and i
27:05 - know javascript i know php
27:07 - and that's so good but but the real
27:09 - thing is i was never surrounded by
27:11 - developers and a community like this
27:13 - so i decided that i would just go into
27:15 - profit of javascript and guys
27:16 - i was the one who wasn't fans in the
27:18 - previous webinar
27:20 - so i didn't have the chance because my
27:22 - dad was sleeping and i wanted to take
27:24 - this for sure so
27:25 - i thought like okay so we have to pay
27:27 - hundred dollars more but then when i
27:29 - woke up
27:30 - i saw the price didn't change and i was
27:31 - like oh no i'm just taking this now
27:36 - you woke up the same day for us it was
27:38 - the same day
27:39 - you're losing yeah i thought
27:43 - well dude like i'm so glad that you took
27:45 - that jump and like
27:47 - from from i think it's really cool
27:48 - because a lot of people are
27:50 - in your position that you're in a week
27:52 - ago right now so what would you what
27:54 - would be your advice to them if they're
27:55 - sitting on the fence
27:56 - and they're not sure about joining or
27:58 - not joining
28:00 - right if you are on the fence you should
28:01 - know that you will never get any
28:03 - community like this
28:04 - if you go on stack overflow you post a
28:05 - question then people will answer this
28:07 - but nobody will give you an answer they
28:09 - will it will all be
28:10 - are you dumb don't you know how to do
28:12 - things it's like
28:13 - no dude that that doesn't mean how the
28:15 - things work they would even say that
28:16 - this is already answered go to this page
28:18 - no that's not how things work in the
28:20 - community in the slack community
28:22 - um there are people who get doubts every
28:24 - day and there are beginners one
28:26 - is duplicate even yeah yeah
28:36 - in the slack community even if people
28:38 - don't know the answer they are
28:40 - very happy to help because in the
28:41 - process they also learn something and
28:44 - that's very important like if you try to
28:46 - answer something and
28:47 - you you are into that problem and then
28:49 - you know how to solve it
28:50 - at the end of the day you look at the
28:52 - threads you know how to solve it and
28:54 - that's what we have for
28:56 - like the modules are also good but the
28:58 - community
28:59 - best part you can ever have and the
29:01 - coaching calls is also the good part of
29:03 - it because in coaching calls you get a
29:05 - huge value bombs and
29:07 - you can ask any question anytime like no
29:09 - one is there to stop you
29:10 - you just raise your hand in zoom call
29:12 - and you get your question answered
29:14 - that's awesome people like that you
29:16 - actually saw the coaching call this week
29:18 - right you jumped in both i think
29:19 - right you were in both coaching yeah i
29:22 - jumped into both coaching calls and i
29:25 - uh in one of the coaching calls i even
29:26 - made a video and shared
29:28 - with the oh yeah yeah
29:31 - yeah dude
29:34 - thank you so much for coming on i know
29:36 - we jumped on ig live yesterday too so
29:38 - i'm pumped thank you
29:40 - yeah i'll see you again on ig live dude
29:43 - thank you so much for joining
29:44 - all right brother take care take care
29:46 - bro
29:48 - um i'm really curious to hear some of
29:50 - the people's uh stories as well
29:53 - i can't share my screen but maybe sunny
29:56 - you can also share screen and
29:58 - show the actual page
29:59 - cleverprogrammer.com
30:01 - pwj let's do it dude so i'm gonna go
30:04 - ahead and show my screen right now for
30:06 - you guys
30:07 - boom there we go so you guys should be
30:10 - able to see the screen
30:12 - no yep now we can see it so you guys can
30:14 - see the link at the bottom of
30:16 - you want to clear your screen brush uh
30:19 - can you see oh
30:20 - yeah oh god damn it yeah there you go um
30:23 - right so right 500
30:25 - now yeah so right now guys we pretty
30:29 - much
30:29 - uh like you can see we have 12 hours
30:33 - left right so pretty much and to be
30:34 - honest i think maybe at the end of this
30:36 - uh we usually actually ended this
30:37 - webinar might be jumping that price up
30:39 - so
30:40 - um if you go ahead and join the benefit
30:43 - is right if you join the course right
30:44 - now
30:44 - in this webinar me you're going to get a
30:46 - coaching call with me and kazi which we
30:48 - don't offer to everyone right that's
30:49 - going to be an exclusive thing for you
30:51 - guys
30:51 - inside this webinar right now and
30:53 - something i want to show you guys so the
30:55 - the course itself consists of a bunch of
30:56 - stuff guys you've got 15
30:58 - modules and these are going to be like
31:00 - it does not matter if you are a complete
31:02 - beginner you're going to get pretty much
31:04 - brought up to that standard of where
31:06 - you're coding you're basically creating
31:07 - your own projects
31:08 - we have weekly javascript and react
31:10 - coaching calls so that includes myself
31:12 - every tuesday we have nars i think on
31:13 - saturdays and then we have the the
31:15 - success coaches
31:16 - so success coaches are huge guys like
31:19 - they're going to provide you personal
31:21 - personalized video feedback on every
31:23 - single one of your assignments
31:24 - so this is something that you don't get
31:26 - on stack overflow or you don't get this
31:27 - on a udemy course
31:28 - you're not going to get somebody
31:29 - actually drop you a video saying
31:32 - this is awesome what you've done over
31:33 - here but this bit of code can be written
31:35 - a bit differently
31:36 - you're gonna get that inside the course
31:38 - and i don't i mean until this day i
31:40 - don't know anywhere i've tried to find
31:42 - other places i'm yet to find somewhere
31:44 - that actually gives you proper
31:45 - personalized video feedback
31:47 - and on top of that guys we're going to
31:48 - show you how to make money from it okay
31:49 - so to consider as an investment in
31:51 - yourself
31:51 - we're going to go ahead and teach you
31:52 - how to make money now you don't have to
31:54 - take our word on it we pretty much have
31:56 - like a bunch of bills that you guys have
31:57 - seen
31:58 - you guys are going to go ahead and be
31:59 - able to create all of these builds
32:01 - we actually have so many people inside
32:03 - the course right now like frank you're
32:04 - going to be up to speed
32:05 - can you show the amazon one by the way
32:07 - uh yeah dude let's do it
32:09 - so this one right here is nice yeah this
32:12 - one's still
32:14 - [Music]
32:26 - damn would you guys like to learn how to
32:28 - make that exactly guys if you want to
32:30 - know how to build
32:32 - this stuff including all the
32:33 - functionality you can see right now
32:35 - full ecommerce functionality
32:38 - then we go ahead and we're going to show
32:40 - you how to do all of that
32:42 - this guy even added the animations dude
32:44 - i love this build i love this uh
32:46 - we have a few questions too so somebody
32:48 - says how much time will it take to
32:50 - become a react gs developer the clip
32:52 - zone asks
32:54 - so it's a very good question um
32:57 - maybe we should wait let's come back on
32:58 - the screen and we can answer it um and
33:00 - by the way
33:00 - a week from now the doors close to the
33:02 - program so that's something i also want
33:04 - to let you guys know
33:05 - yeah exactly so a week from now our
33:07 - doors completely closed we do that to
33:09 - keep the quality of the students very
33:11 - high
33:12 - um so right now like where we have the
33:15 - doors open but in a week's time we're
33:16 - going to close that stuff and pretty
33:18 - much
33:18 - we're not going to open up again maybe
33:19 - for a few months maybe for a year we
33:21 - don't know yet
33:21 - we pretty much we're not sure on that
33:23 - but we like to keep our community
33:25 - very powerful very positive and to do
33:26 - that that's why we do it this way
33:28 - now the to answer your question to
33:30 - become a react developer
33:31 - my advice guys is if you
33:34 - can go ahead um and it's all about how
33:37 - much
33:38 - time you're willing to put in right so
33:40 - if let's say you join the course today
33:42 - and you put in two hours a week now i
33:44 - can't promise you
33:45 - in a year's time you're gonna even be a
33:46 - developer right like because then you're
33:48 - gonna need to point some
33:49 - serious work like when i'm talking
33:51 - serious work i'm like kazi said before
33:53 - uh to ken i think it was who jumped on
33:55 - like it's going to take
33:58 - another person jumping in lovely michael
34:01 - let's go
34:02 - we just got michael enrolled in profit
34:05 - with javascript
34:06 - awesome dude welcome to the course nice
34:09 - so yeah you're gonna pretty much if
34:11 - you're gonna like i would recommend
34:12 - dedicating
34:13 - imagine you had a day job right that's
34:16 - eight hours a day
34:17 - right consider that as your minimum i
34:19 - would say like if you really want to
34:20 - grow
34:21 - give it your give it some serious time
34:23 - like make it consider it not just like a
34:25 - little side hobby
34:26 - something like that if you want this to
34:27 - become your full-time income then
34:29 - dedicate and treat it like a full-time
34:31 - job
34:31 - right like give it that same amount of
34:33 - hours and then in my in my personal
34:35 - opinion
34:35 - i believe i honestly believe if you
34:37 - follow we have a nice little road map
34:39 - and i usually teach a way that you can
34:41 - actually start earning money during the
34:43 - three months
34:43 - that i would actually predict that you
34:45 - could become a developer
34:47 - very intense three months right like i
34:49 - wouldn't say it works for everyone three
34:50 - months but you can pretty much make it
34:52 - work in three months
34:53 - but you can pretty much go ahead and
34:55 - actually in your first month's stuff
34:56 - roadmap that you
34:57 - and i we showed last time too and it's
34:59 - basically like imagine if a timeline is
35:02 - like this right
35:02 - yeah you can spend three months actually
35:05 - learning the skills and building the
35:06 - projects and the next three months
35:08 - actually working on applying for jobs
35:12 - and you're applying for jobs that are
35:13 - probably around between 40 to sixty
35:15 - thousand dollar a year range
35:17 - exactly a complete beginner oh crap i
35:20 - totally forgot i'm sorry we have
35:21 - luke i wanna bring on some of the people
35:23 - here so luke
35:25 - uh he's like hey this is one of the
35:26 - newbies from the program if you wanna
35:28 - get our experience how are you doing
35:29 - yeah
35:30 - what up what up here's henry yeah man
35:32 - can you hear me
35:33 - awesome yeah i know uh
35:37 - yeah i've been trying to grow this out
35:38 - but i know uh pretty much i've been on
35:40 - the fence for quite some time i think i
35:42 - actually sent on
35:43 - two emails to you guys uh to like the
35:45 - supports that just to see like what i
35:47 - was truly getting
35:48 - um because you know 600 it is an
35:50 - investment obviously so you know some
35:51 - people cannot afford it or some people
35:53 - are just like debating and they're on
35:54 - the fence over the price
35:56 - but for me like learning all the modules
36:00 - um not just the twitter but like
36:02 - eventually zoom spotify netflix going
36:04 - more in depth and just what's on the
36:05 - youtube content
36:07 - and then as well as like the weekly
36:08 - coaching calls like those have been like
36:10 - amazing i haven't been able to
36:11 - participate in them yet
36:13 - um but i do the i re-watch them so every
36:15 - single one is like recording you can
36:16 - just rewatch them so
36:18 - that has been fantastic and then
36:19 - obviously the community like i've done
36:22 - so just i guess for everybody else is on
36:24 - the fence or if they're just wondering
36:25 - um
36:26 - i've done udemy courses i've done
36:27 - youtube tutorials
36:29 - um i've paid for all like other classes
36:31 - as well and what's different is just
36:33 - like the whole community like you get a
36:34 - udemy course and ever
36:35 - it's pre-recorded same thing here but
36:37 - like the community is a lot different
36:39 - and you to me like you don't really get
36:40 - like the interaction that you guys get
36:42 - here
36:43 - every single day i log on to slack you
36:45 - can see like 100 missed messages
36:47 - everyone's just constantly like
36:48 - asking questions you know like
36:50 - everyone's always communicating over and
36:51 - saying something like everyone
36:52 - at least is answering questions or
36:54 - working on something um recently i found
36:56 - out that there's like weekly homework
36:57 - assignments too like somebody was
36:59 - working like a tip calculator and things
37:00 - like that and that's just something that
37:01 - you don't get with udemy courses you
37:03 - know udemy courses
37:04 - they do two or three projects and that's
37:06 - about it so that's obviously like that
37:08 - luke give me a little bit of like give
37:11 - me a little bit of your background
37:13 - so before this program yo rami what's
37:16 - going on
37:16 - man i'll call you up in a second so give
37:19 - me a little bit of your background
37:20 - before this right who
37:22 - is who is luke like what just tell us
37:25 - give us a little bit about you
37:27 - uh all right so let's see here i started
37:30 - out pretty much working like a
37:31 - restaurant and hospitality industry
37:33 - um i worked my way up through like a
37:35 - server through bartender eventually
37:36 - moved up into management
37:38 - um anyone that knows a part of the
37:39 - restaurant industry like you know you're
37:41 - working hard
37:42 - you're you know you have 12 14 16 hour
37:44 - shifts you're busting your ass you know
37:45 - so i don't know if i'm not allowed to
37:46 - swear or not but
37:47 - you're busting you know i swear as much
37:49 - as you [ __ ] want all right
37:51 - um but yeah you know you're hustling
37:52 - you're busting you know everyone knows
37:54 - the industry you don't get weekends off
37:55 - you don't get holidays off
37:57 - none of that you know if you got to work
37:59 - a 10-hour shift guess what you're
38:00 - working a 10-hour shift a 12-hour shift
38:01 - 14-hour shift
38:03 - so and then i uh came across a bunch of
38:05 - youtube videos about coding
38:07 - it kind of sparked my interest oddly
38:09 - enough i started with like python i
38:11 - couldn't really get it to set up
38:12 - properly i think i spent like a week on
38:14 - it
38:14 - gave up and then like a following a
38:17 - month i did like
38:18 - a lot more research uh seeing which path
38:20 - i wanted to go down
38:22 - ended up coming up with uh javascript so
38:24 - i did html css javascript and i've been
38:26 - self-taught for like the past
38:28 - five months now so pretty much looking
38:30 - forward to kind of make that change and
38:31 - uh
38:32 - landing some clients so i decided to
38:34 - jump on board
38:35 - nice your main motivation was to land
38:37 - the clients it was actually self-taught
38:39 - javascript
38:40 - five months progress and then you wanted
38:42 - to take it to that next level and
38:43 - actually
38:44 - income right so you actually jumped in
38:46 - the course that's awesome dude really
38:47 - really awesome yeah
38:48 - yeah yeah that's pretty much it um like
38:50 - i said like i would love to like lease
38:52 - land clients so that way i could become
38:54 - a full-time developer you know not have
38:56 - to go to work but right now i have like
38:58 - a nine-to-five job so i'm doing that
39:00 - and then i'm spending two three hours
39:01 - four hours a day uh coding also
39:03 - afterwards so
39:05 - why are you coding why what's your goal
39:08 - why do you need to make
39:10 - an income you know why couldn't you just
39:12 - be
39:13 - doing the job at the hospital you know
39:15 - in the hospitality and all that uh
39:17 - the quality of life man that just all it
39:20 - is uh
39:20 - coding allows you to i mean if you're a
39:23 - freelance and you get to work from
39:24 - everywhere
39:25 - you know from anywhere in the world that
39:26 - you want you get to set your own hours
39:28 - yeah you have to have your own
39:29 - discipline and
39:30 - you know determination to make that
39:31 - happen obviously nothing's going to be
39:32 - handed to you on the plate
39:34 - um so even if people are saying like oh
39:36 - yeah be cool to work from vacate like
39:38 - you know in florida or miami or bali or
39:40 - germany like wherever you want to work
39:42 - from like yeah but you still have to
39:43 - hustle like you still have to work hard
39:44 - you know like one way or another you
39:46 - have to work
39:47 - right yeah um but yeah no creating the
39:49 - quality of life
39:50 - setting my own hours um you know pretty
39:53 - much charging you know people whatever i
39:54 - would want to charge what
39:56 - i think my worth what my time you know i
39:58 - think it's worth to them
40:00 - um and that's huge and it's also it's
40:02 - like uh you know people in the past that
40:04 - like trade skills are important like
40:06 - manufacturing cnc cad work steel work
40:09 - well now as we go towards the future
40:11 - technology is going to be like those
40:13 - trade skills
40:14 - you know technology is everywhere i mean
40:16 - it's on dishwashers now you can have lcd
40:18 - little panels on refrigerators like it's
40:20 - crazy like it's going to be everywhere
40:22 - so like being a part of that chain
40:24 - is important so so i have a question for
40:27 - you
40:28 - how much time have you been able to
40:30 - spend in profit with javascript
40:32 - uh with profit with javascript i want to
40:34 - say maybe with like 10
40:36 - 20 hours not much i literally joined i
40:38 - think uh
40:39 - two or three days ago i want to say um
40:42 - so i haven't been able to spend too much
40:43 - time but
40:44 - uh just navigating 20 hours that you
40:46 - spent
40:48 - what's your experience been like and
40:49 - would you actually recommend it to
40:50 - somebody
40:51 - oh yeah no absolutely it's been it's
40:53 - been phenomenal like i said like the
40:54 - community itself has been phenomenal
40:56 - asking a lot of questions you get a lot
40:58 - of feedback um
40:59 - everyone is like responsive so that's
41:01 - been great and the amount of knowledge
41:03 - that you can actually get out of the
41:04 - single course like it's worth it like
41:05 - that's what pushed me over the edge
41:07 - i'm just saying that value and just
41:09 - constantly you know having that
41:10 - available and
41:12 - lifetime access like you it's a huge
41:14 - value say i would definitely
41:15 - absolutely recommend it it's like one of
41:17 - those like listen you also it's an
41:19 - investment in yourself like it is you
41:21 - know to some people it can be like a lot
41:23 - of money but it just
41:24 - that's an extra motivation for you all
41:26 - right if you're gonna pay something like
41:27 - that
41:28 - you might as well get that worth out of
41:29 - it you know that value out of it so
41:31 - that's a really good point then kazi
41:33 - actually said that to me as well before
41:34 - in in
41:35 - in the previous webinar like if you get
41:37 - something for free guys like
41:39 - we all treat that free thing like like
41:41 - [ __ ] like pretty much none of us
41:43 - another student let's go
41:48 - price is going up man if you are on the
41:49 - fence what are you doing jump in we have
41:52 - a 30 day money back guarantee too
41:54 - exactly what's up right now uh ronald
41:56 - ceballos welcome to the family
41:59 - uh yeah so exactly yeah if you if you
42:02 - get something for free your investment
42:04 - in that like whether it's a product or
42:06 - whatever it is your investment in that
42:07 - is very
42:08 - everybody who wins our challenge
42:11 - the first place yep they don't even show
42:15 - up to the calls
42:16 - yeah i can actually say yeah that's a
42:18 - really good point
42:19 - yeah exactly so like literally the
42:22 - people who actually buy the course
42:24 - that i can tell you because i personally
42:25 - see them on the calls right they
42:27 - literally they turn up
42:28 - they show up they want to invest they
42:30 - want to complete the modules they want
42:31 - to go back to the modules because they
42:33 - paid for those modules
42:34 - and then they want to do it again right
42:36 - and that's what is going to push you
42:37 - that motivation that drive
42:39 - all of those things so like exactly like
42:43 - exactly luke said like it's an
42:44 - investment in yourself and that
42:46 - investment is
42:46 - further than just the course it's going
42:48 - to push you and be your actual main mode
42:50 - especially in the beginning of your
42:51 - journey yeah
42:53 - thank you so much for coming on luke
42:55 - really appreciate it no problem no
42:56 - problem and thanks for having me on
42:58 - looking forward to the coaching call
42:59 - later
42:59 - see you later so somebody asked
43:03 - tyson asked he goes hey do we cover
43:05 - loops
43:06 - and variables and you know
43:09 - all these basic functions like do we
43:11 - cover basics
43:12 - so i guess let's have joe diaz let us
43:15 - know if we do cover them or not
43:17 - good good way of doing that dude nice
43:21 - what's up joe how's it going hey what's
43:24 - going on brother
43:25 - holy [ __ ] i love i love your energy bro
43:28 - it's amazing it's so good so what's
43:30 - going on
43:32 - so somebody asked if we cover loops and
43:35 - variables and arrays and like basics do
43:37 - we cover them or we do we not in the
43:39 - course no
43:40 - we don't we don't cover all that [ __ ]
43:42 - yeah you gotta pay to find out
43:46 - get enrolled in the i would have seen
43:48 - that
43:49 - no seriously i mean we cover all the
43:51 - basics this
43:52 - course by far you start with the basics
43:56 - you learn html those are the building
43:59 - blocks as someone was asking on the post
44:00 - you know hey
44:01 - can i study can i be a good react
44:04 - developer
44:05 - well don't get to react yet just get the
44:07 - html css
44:08 - part solidified first because that's the
44:11 - building blocks of react
44:13 - then you learn javascript and then they
44:15 - all combine together you know you can
44:16 - learn react
44:18 - and uh to get back to what the others
44:20 - are saying is you know this community is
44:22 - awesome
44:23 - and the one thing i like about this
44:25 - community is the
44:27 - i get to get involved with people
44:29 - getting into
44:30 - problems you know issues like yesterday
44:32 - we were debugging for nearly i guess
44:34 - uh four forty minute sessions with ronak
44:37 - kumar
44:39 - and we identified that uh his amazon
44:42 - clone
44:43 - after his after he would deploy it to
44:45 - come up with a blank page
44:47 - and for the life of me and leaf we
44:48 - couldn't figure out what's going on so
44:50 - it was a comment in the props that was
44:54 - causing the issue
44:55 - right so we so we went through the we
44:57 - went through the project we went through
44:59 - a fake deploy hello world
45:00 - we stripped everything down we deployed
45:02 - it it was coming up fine
45:04 - then we put pieces together one at a
45:05 - time and then as soon as he put
45:08 - put his checking checkout page it had
45:10 - the comment boom
45:12 - we figured it out so we then
45:15 - lift leaf was able to find that that was
45:17 - this is a known bug
45:18 - and it's been logged in and react so now
45:20 - you know you know it's like
45:21 - i would know that so and anyone the
45:23 - community runs into similar issue i
45:25 - have the resolution so that's what i
45:27 - like about this community is
45:29 - solving problems of people that
45:30 - encounter you know take time
45:32 - to go through the code this you guys
45:34 - whoever's on the fence this is not
45:36 - something that you can find on stack
45:37 - overflow or any
45:39 - udemy or i know udacity or whatever

49:31 - if you handed me a cv with five pages i
49:33 - wouldn't
49:33 - i'm i'm telling you right now i wouldn't
49:35 - read it like as in like as in the truth
49:38 - is but if you showed me a website
49:39 - saying that this is my portfolio and
49:41 - here's my apps that would impress me
49:43 - that would show me some stuff like then
49:45 - i would actually go ahead and play with
49:46 - it
49:46 - we kind of show you all that we tell you
49:48 - the shortcuts we tell you the actual
49:50 - reality
49:51 - because the the reality is i think i
49:53 - think the way that we're taught
49:54 - from like school and the education
49:56 - system is broken like it's not
49:58 - reality it doesn't show you reality it
49:59 - doesn't show you how it actually go the
50:02 - conversation actually happens
50:04 - when you when you leave university or
50:05 - when you go through those sort of
50:07 - modules because they promise you like
50:09 - okay you're gonna get the degree
50:10 - and you're to go outside and then you're
50:12 - going to wave this piece of paper
50:14 - and somebody's going to give you a job
50:16 - right and you're going to pretty much
50:17 - put all of that
50:18 - piece of paper in the fancy details on a
50:19 - piece of paper which we call our resume
50:21 - and that's going to go and land your job
50:22 - and the truth is it doesn't work like
50:24 - that
50:24 - okay like so miriam said i think two
50:27 - pages are more than enough i couldn't
50:28 - agree more i think if you get your
50:29 - resume
50:30 - two pages is more than enough any more
50:32 - than two pages
50:33 - you're overshooting like because then
50:35 - maybe yeah i have a link saying here's a
50:37 - here's my website go and check that out
50:38 - if you want to find out more
50:40 - but yeah so let's start taking on some
50:43 - questions as well so if you guys have
50:44 - questions start dropping them and we
50:46 - want to take them on so one of the
50:47 - questions is hey can i
50:48 - directly go with react javascript or
50:51 - should i learn
50:52 - javascript first um
50:56 - so what was that so either react to
50:58 - javascript she asked
50:59 - which one should i learn first can i so
51:01 - basically somebody's asking can i
51:02 - directly start learning react
51:04 - or do i need to learn javascript first
51:07 - so um
51:08 - my advice is yo what's up corey yeah my
51:11 - advice would be
51:12 - for that go ahead and learn the
51:14 - fundamentals first right
51:16 - it's like you're trying to ask can i
51:17 - build a mansion or should i build a
51:19 - house first like
51:20 - you need to know you need to pretty much
51:22 - go ahead and like learn the fundamentals
51:24 - like get know how to build the
51:25 - foundations and the foundations in this
51:27 - case
51:27 - are html and absolutely basics of
51:30 - javascript you don't have to become a
51:31 - javascript pro
51:33 - but the basics of javascript because
51:35 - what i thought one of my mentors i
51:36 - remember in 2017
51:39 - no not 2017 2016 when i was picking up a
51:42 - lot of the coding skills he's like
51:44 - don't even think about react until
51:48 - you spend three or four more years
51:49 - learning coding
51:51 - and reading clean code and reading
51:54 - all these like books on algorithms and
51:56 - data structures
51:58 - no i see like i would like scream at
52:00 - that and say go the other way like
52:02 - i would say spend like i would think
52:04 - boxing why would you [ __ ]
52:06 - yeah i know like you just like throw
52:08 - that over like
52:10 - like honestly guys like literally the
52:12 - basics like once you know the basics
52:14 - once you can get pretty much a web page
52:15 - and a button click fun
52:16 - functional why wait jump into react
52:19 - because
52:20 - react is a library that you're using
52:22 - with javascript right so when you're
52:24 - using react
52:25 - naturally your javascript is going to
52:27 - improve right it's going to get better
52:29 - it's going to improve
52:30 - so why the hell are you going to waste
52:31 - your time doing the things separately
52:33 - when your javascript can improve
52:34 - either way when you're doing react oops
52:36 - sonny i just got a great idea
52:38 - yo frank thanks for the 5 donation bro
52:40 - let's go
52:43 - thank you oh nice yeah
52:47 - so i just got actually a really epic
52:49 - idea sunny and i think
52:50 - let me know what you think but i one
52:52 - thing i want to actually try is
52:54 - maybe on a weekend we just do a crowd
52:56 - casting like this so it's easy to bring
52:58 - people on the live with us
53:00 - yep and maybe we just have them
53:04 - apply and build profiles so for example
53:07 - you literally help them build a profile
53:09 - on hired.com
53:11 - oh yeah that'd be dope see what i'm
53:13 - saying yeah
53:14 - and also we help them with like you know
53:16 - some of them maybe
53:17 - i can help them with writing their posts
53:20 - to get freelancing jobs
53:22 - dude that would be insane i think that
53:24 - would be super valuable and i think that
53:26 - would actually help people
53:27 - even um if whoever's got experience in
53:30 - like up work can go ahead and teach how
53:32 - to
53:32 - use up work and set up an upward profile
53:34 - those sort of things or take lessons.com
53:37 - or yzan uh if they're based in united us
53:40 - you know like any of those platforms we
53:42 - can pretty much go ahead and set them up
53:43 - live on a call i think that would be
53:45 - awesome
53:47 - yeah seriously yeah
53:50 - um that would be awesome dude let's go
53:52 - ahead and
53:54 - what's that she got you some nice water
53:58 - yeah she stole my water and i messaged
54:00 - the thing bring back my wall
54:02 - everybody's replying to paul in the
54:04 - comments because paul
54:05 - like was writing these long comments
54:08 - about like
54:09 - what we're doing is wrong trying to get
54:11 - people in profit with javascript and
54:13 - he's like they're just trying to sell
54:14 - their course
54:16 - and going crazy and so i see a bunch of
54:18 - people replying to him and
54:19 - i like vlad's comment and he goes
54:22 - actually they're trying to shorten the
54:24 - time you would have to invest to learn
54:26 - javascript
54:27 - yeah i was buying udemy courses and
54:29 - skills
54:30 - skillshare subscriptions but nothing
54:32 - compares with pwj
54:34 - here we have a community and being a
54:36 - part of this community keeps me
54:38 - motivated all the time we got live calls
54:42 - who else does live calls for the
54:44 - students every week
54:46 - he goes like qazi said it is the best
54:48 - javascript course on the planet
54:50 - exactly dude i don't i don't know if
54:52 - it's my mic actually
54:53 - my your mic what's up what's with your
54:56 - mic
54:57 - oh no we're good we're good yeah we cut
54:59 - out for a little bit um
55:01 - yeah dude i think that's an awesome
55:02 - comment hey another student let's go hey
55:06 - i need to i do i need to add that
55:11 - oh man then nas came to run over to like
55:14 - he's like where's the song playing he

55:26 - phone
55:27 - yep oh
55:31 - so people are like dude i would that
55:33 - would be actually a good idea
55:35 - uh like us doing the live call and
55:36 - actually helping people on the live call
55:39 - yeah venky asks do you cover
55:42 - dev ops are we planning to cover devops
55:44 - in this
55:45 - course or no so right now our focus is
55:48 - mainly on react bringing you as much
55:50 - react value as possible
55:52 - damn his setup was sick that's what i
55:54 - was like we just found our freaking
55:56 - cp new cp team member yeah i like that
55:59 - sound
56:00 - yeah i'm actually doing my wednesday so
56:03 - stay tuned guys
56:04 - i mean wayne if you want to make you
56:06 - know we're we are looking for a content
56:08 - creator
56:09 - yeah he had a perfect live streaming
56:13 - setup right there
56:14 - yeah yeah all right let me see if we can
56:17 - take on another question
56:21 - okay let's see any prerequisites for
56:24 - this course
56:26 - um no dude so you can actually if you've
56:29 - never heard of code before you don't
56:31 - even know where to begin with coding you
56:32 - have no idea how to build a website
56:35 - this is the place for you we're pretty
56:36 - much we will take you or what will
56:38 - literally hold your hand
56:39 - teach you all the foundations for the
56:41 - fundamentals for html css javascript and
56:44 - with that we will pair you with the
56:46 - right the correct knowledge as to
56:48 - how to use those skills and become
56:51 - like somewhat of a a sellable asset to
56:54 - somebody else so like you can actually
56:56 - go ahead and make some money with the
56:58 - skills that you learn right so we're
56:59 - gonna go ahead and teach you that
57:00 - and then on top of that we pretty much
57:02 - then upgrade your knowledge
57:03 - by layering react on top and hey
57:07 - let's go
57:18 - [Music]
57:21 - i'm still on youtube yeah
57:28 - can you see me can you hear me yeah yeah
57:32 - wait oh i can hear okay so i can hear

57:55 - we are so excited to have you in the
57:56 - program
57:58 - kazi you're gone who's gone
58:04 - crowd we can see sunny i just see qazi
58:08 - sunny is disconnecting yo priyanshu how
58:11 - are you doing
58:12 - hey man oh okay i'm back there we go
58:16 - there we go now we can see everybody
58:19 - priyanshu
58:20 - talk to us man first of all just give us
58:23 - a little bit of background what got you
58:24 - into coding
58:25 - how old you are how old you were when
58:27 - you got into coding give us a little bit
58:29 - of your background bro
58:30 - so everyone i'm priyanji siraj i'm from
58:32 - india i'm 13 years old and i
58:34 - have around two years of experience
58:36 - actually i would say i had around one
58:37 - years of experience
58:38 - i got into coding when i was 11 when i
58:41 - when i was exactly 11 that was my
58:43 - birthday when i got into coding
58:44 - and um it was actually clever programmer
58:47 - themselves who got me into coding so
58:49 - that was amazing
58:50 - then um this one it's all went on i
58:53 - thought that coding was cool and i
58:55 - started learning python
58:56 - and after a few months of uh learning
58:59 - python i got stuck into
59:00 - tutorial help so that was like the worst
59:02 - thing that you can possibly imagine
59:04 - now uh what actually happened was that
59:08 - i didn't code for uh six months straight
59:11 - like no coding at all so that was kind
59:14 - of me
59:15 - so and then suddenly all of a sudden
59:18 - this forward situation comes in
59:20 - and i also have a really good friend who
59:22 - helped me out and he told me that yeah
59:24 - you can do it man you can you can do it
59:26 - just crush it
59:27 - and then uh you discover thing it and
59:30 - you guys started off with the google
59:32 - maps challenge
59:33 - i was so so like i was hell inspired
59:37 - yeah i just make this i get my portfolio
59:40 - up and running i'll show my parents that
59:42 - i can do the second show everyone that i
59:43 - can do this and i made it
59:46 - but that time i didn't actually even
59:48 - anything so like i was
59:49 - actually delayed and then i was learning
59:52 - more about javascript and then came
59:53 - their live streams of react
59:56 - really impressive like seems they're
59:57 - still on youtube you can all go check it
59:59 - out
60:00 - and then this amazon challenge came
60:04 - this was like the best thing that
60:05 - happened to me ever so
60:08 - i learned about react i learned about
60:10 - react context i learned everything about
60:11 - riyadh that i need to know
60:13 - and after that guess what
60:16 - on 12 september at midnight uh for it
60:20 - for india it was 13 september the
60:23 - midnight so i jumped on a live call
60:27 - with sunny himself and he that was like
60:30 - enough for heaven for me
60:32 - after that the next thing i know
60:35 - sunny took me into pwj for free that's
60:39 - it dude it was your answer like
60:48 - disagree on what you just said that all
60:50 - of the people who get the course for
60:52 - free
60:52 - don't even show up i have showed up in
60:54 - literally all of the calls and i've
60:56 - sucked through even though it was like
60:57 - 2 20 a.m 3 a.m or something and
61:01 - all of them are jam-packed with value
61:03 - i'm already towards module 8 of the
61:05 - course
61:05 - and it's going amazing like if you guys
61:08 - are actually on the fence like everyone
61:10 - else has said even i'll see the same
61:11 - thing
61:12 - the two most valuable things that you
61:14 - have actually three
61:16 - are success coaches the community itself
61:19 - and the live streams
61:20 - guys this is highly neglected and i'll
61:23 - tell you the
61:24 - difference between any udemy course in
61:25 - them in a i have actually bought several
61:28 - udemy courses myself
61:29 - and what happens is that you tend to
61:31 - check out more about programming
61:32 - yourself right i was on this flutter
61:34 - course recently
61:35 - and i had and they showed me how to
61:37 - build a hello world application in
61:38 - flutter
61:39 - now i wanted to add some more widgets to
61:42 - it
61:42 - but what happened like any night it
61:45 - would happen to any one of you
61:47 - the same thing happened with me i tried
61:49 - to play around with the code
61:50 - and i and i messed up i didn't have
61:53 - anyone in the entire world to help me
61:55 - and i felt like i was already in the
61:57 - grave but
61:58 - these guys the difference between them
62:00 - and everyone else is that the live
62:02 - streams that they have they have
62:04 - separate q a session for you so like you
62:06 - will get
62:07 - you'll get to speak with sunny you'll
62:08 - get to speak with nas and you will be
62:09 - able to clear
62:10 - all your doubts out like i i am making
62:12 - some uh
62:14 - word uh word application so that the
62:16 - next time
62:17 - i hop on a stream with a nas or sunny i
62:20 - can actually ask them my questions
62:22 - and like you have to it's not some
62:24 - people even think that
62:25 - okay i bought this course now it's going
62:28 - to be there with me for my lifetime i'll
62:29 - just keep it aside i'll do my stuff
62:31 - right now
62:32 - guys that's not at all how it's how it's
62:34 - supposed to be like i even though my
62:35 - exams are going on i'm still putting in
62:37 - like as much as i can like i'm putting
62:39 - in four hours i can get five hours
62:40 - and i'm trying to make these uh word
62:42 - applications so that
62:43 - even i can be there in those streams and
62:45 - i can actually clear out my doubts the
62:47 - clouds that i have
62:48 - and i and the best part about the stream
62:50 - is with nas
62:51 - at the end you guys get to party like
62:53 - anything like think about think about it
62:55 - like
62:55 - the best day in your world like every
62:58 - other
62:59 - thursday that's how good it is guys
63:02 - that's awesome dude i love your energy
63:06 - dude thank you man i appreciate you and
63:09 - not you know not everybody has that and
63:12 - so i think that's really important
63:13 - because
63:14 - even when you talked about qazi it's not
63:17 - true you can give a free course to
63:18 - somebody
63:19 - i think you were an exception and sunny
63:21 - saw that and that's
63:23 - why he like kind of picked you out and
63:25 - he was like yo let's go
63:26 - but honest truth is unfortunately in
63:30 - most of the situations when
63:32 - people get things for free they don't
63:34 - appreciate it and
63:35 - i am actually not i am the same way as
63:39 - well
63:39 - myself like yeah that happens to me too
63:42 - like i
63:42 - tend to always like think about it to be
63:45 - given to me for granted
63:47 - and like several others do that too like
63:49 - think about it
63:50 - buying a fake bed from uh the roadside
63:54 - and buying a bed from louis vuitton
63:56 - think about it like that which one would
63:57 - you uh care more like you would also
64:00 - always care more about the louis vuitton
64:01 - bed not just because of how
64:03 - how expensive it was but also because
64:05 - the quality that you're getting right
64:06 - so it's the same thing over here like
64:08 - these guys actually like push you
64:10 - until you are actually like a good
64:11 - developer they're always like as sonny
64:13 - says
64:14 - they're always there holding your hands
64:15 - and walking you through and that is
64:17 - something that's
64:18 - i i've never seen that in any course
64:20 - ever ever
64:22 - dude i i love the uh the the comparisons
64:25 - you come with that cleared it up really
64:27 - well it's like a louis vuitton
64:28 - verse like a boat you're going to get
64:30 - off the side of the street like which
64:31 - one you're going to take care of more
64:32 - right like
64:33 - it's an investment in yourself and it's
64:35 - true like when i jumped on their first
64:37 - call with brienne uh with brit like
64:39 - he it wasn't like it wasn't the fact
64:41 - that he was he was
64:42 - young right it wasn't the fact that he's
64:44 - a young coder it was because
64:46 - like one of that guy one of those guys
64:48 - said that i was young so i got a course
64:49 - free that's not a dollar how it is yeah
64:51 - like it wasn't that guys it was a case
64:53 - of like he knew like when when he was
64:55 - speaking to me like he was like i can't
64:56 - afford the course but here's what i'm
64:57 - doing
64:58 - and he that was the energy that i felt
65:00 - and like i was like yo this is like
65:02 - we have to have this energy in the
65:03 - course because it showed that like
65:05 - he wasn't looking at it in terms of
65:07 - money he was looking in terms of like
65:08 - right i know i can't
65:09 - get into the course right now but but
65:11 - what can i do to better my situation
65:14 - so that like inside at some point i will
65:16 - be able to get in the course and if i
65:17 - don't
65:18 - god damn it i'm going to be a developer
65:19 - if somebody like somebody's not going to
65:21 - stop me right like it was
65:23 - like i would like to just cut you off
65:24 - for a minute for all those people who
65:26 - are
65:27 - actually like not in that situation who
65:29 - who can actually afford the course
65:31 - like it is actually expensive i wouldn't
65:33 - say that it doesn't but it's actually an
65:34 - investment on yourself and even if you
65:36 - can't i
65:37 - highly highly recommend you guys to
65:39 - watch their clones that they build
65:41 - in the amazon clone which you have on
65:43 - your youtube like they explain react
65:45 - context api like
65:47 - like anything and if you guys want to be
65:49 - in that my peace of mind
65:51 - state you guys should definitely check
65:53 - out this book deep book
65:54 - oh that's a great book by cal newport
65:56 - right fantastic book and talks yeah
65:59 - i was talking about brother about it
66:00 - just yesterday
66:02 - yeah it's it's so good and like when you
66:05 - like actually complete the complete
66:07 - reading the book even i'm
66:08 - doing it right now i'm reading it every
66:10 - day you guys actually
66:12 - tried to follow the rules and principles
66:16 - that kyle newport talks about it inside
66:17 - of you
66:18 - and try to be in that mind how did you
66:20 - get into personal development did your
66:21 - parents push you to get into personal
66:23 - development or did you pick it up on
66:25 - your own what
66:27 - it was actually kind of really funny
66:28 - like school is kind of easy for me
66:30 - because
66:31 - number one all the teachers [ __ ] and
66:32 - number two i have some friends who help
66:34 - me out
66:35 - oftentimes and my post
66:43 - so i got into personal development
66:46 - because see
66:47 - the ability of a person to just sit in
66:49 - his house and code all day and make a
66:51 - difference just by singer
66:52 - sitting at his house and not like being
66:54 - some kind of uh
66:55 - politician and making a difference that
66:58 - actually surprises me like
66:59 - the your ability to just sit in front of
67:01 - your computer and
67:02 - make a difference in hundreds of
67:04 - thousands of people's life
67:05 - is really surprising to me because
67:08 - you're putting in so much hard work and
67:10 - like this is so amazing like i had that
67:13 - ability that i never knew of
67:14 - in the two years back when i actually
67:16 - found out about coding i
67:18 - knew my potential of this laptop this
67:19 - crappy laptop that i have
67:21 - and i started to use it in the good way
67:22 - like oftentimes people tend to buy a
67:24 - laptop for the
67:25 - entertainment purposes right like some
67:26 - people buy for youtube some people wear
67:28 - it for netflix
67:29 - i even that was kind of like my
67:31 - performance and some people buy a
67:32 - chromebook
67:39 - oh my that thing guys yeah so
67:43 - that is something that's extremely good
67:44 - like they're that just
67:46 - mindset that you need to have like i'm
67:48 - learning something new like
67:50 - all the time that i've ever been like at
67:52 - any point of life
67:53 - i've always been in that learning
67:55 - attitude like i always want to learn
67:57 - more and more and more
67:58 - i have like tons and tons of
67:59 - encyclopedias i i used to study about
68:01 - theoretical physics
68:03 - and i was really engrossed in that too
68:05 - and i loved coding because
68:07 - i could build things that were really
68:10 - amazing and that could actually change
68:11 - the world
68:12 - and that would implement my life and as
68:15 - you guys
68:15 - asked me to do i started to document my
68:17 - journey i wrote i started to write blogs
68:19 - two days
68:20 - earlier and like you know how good it
68:23 - feels
68:24 - when you actually try to bring out value
68:26 - i want you to make i want you to make
68:28 - youtube content
68:30 - on coding or personal development or
68:32 - anything like that start off with like
68:34 - full on youtube can you make a video
68:37 - this week and post it up definitely i'm
68:40 - i'm working on
68:41 - on my exam i was working on
68:45 - yeah when would you upload your first
68:47 - video
68:48 - i'm planning to do it on wednesday
68:50 - because wednesday is actually my lucky
68:51 - day i've done several new things in
68:53 - wednesdays can you have it
68:54 - uploaded and published by thursday
68:58 - let's go dude no i'm actually planning
69:00 - to start creating the content and
69:02 - i'll brainstorm it tomorrow on monday
69:05 - i am teaching my friend so i'm gonna be
69:07 - occupied in that too
69:09 - and and another thing i would like to
69:11 - say is that guys some people say that
69:13 - like on sunny i talked to him about it
69:15 - yesterday and some people keep on
69:16 - complaining that they don't get clients
69:18 - they don't get students
69:19 - do it for free guys who's stopping you i
69:21 - teach my friends for free
69:22 - and that's how you get you get
69:24 - networking like
69:26 - you guys should watch the igtv video we
69:28 - did with i did but sunny
69:30 - like that is jam packed with value you
69:31 - you everyone should do it everyone
69:33 - should
69:34 - thank you so much for coming on always
69:36 - appreciate your energy
69:38 - when you drop that video send me a link
69:40 - to it on instagram okay
69:41 - i'll drive i'll drive people to watch it
69:44 - okay
69:45 - bye all right take care thank you thanks
69:48 - dude
69:51 - i had to kick him off otherwise he was
69:52 - going to take over this whole [ __ ]
69:54 - show dude
69:57 - if you guys love priyanka and his energy
69:59 - guys drop it in the comments below he's
70:02 - intended
70:07 - dude i feel like i have way too much
70:09 - power with this i know
70:12 - the whole deck is right here um
70:15 - okay we got a great comment by lem
70:18 - kennedy and he goes i'm a seasoned dev
70:20 - and i tutor daily
70:22 - so he's making an income from teaching
70:24 - other people coding which is i
70:26 - highly recommend you do that actually as
70:29 - one of the things
70:30 - he goes taking a break from finals to be
70:33 - here
70:34 - i've seen what the big boot camps are
70:36 - teaching the homework the projects
70:39 - and i can tell you that that's that
70:41 - there's more value here than what you
70:43 - learn at general
70:44 - assembly full sale etc
70:47 - at your own pace too the tas at the boot
70:50 - camps never have time to answer the
70:51 - questions students have
70:53 - no question goes unanswered here now
70:57 - what i like about lem is that he is hey
71:00 - another student just joined in profit
71:01 - with javascript welcome
71:03 - nice so lem started coding and
71:07 - profitable javascript and in his first
71:08 - three weeks he actually cleared fifteen
71:10 - hundred dollars in cash
71:12 - and he's only two months into coding
71:14 - he's a complete
71:16 - beginner to coding um and
71:19 - what is amazing about that about at
71:22 - least he's a beginner when it comes to i
71:23 - think react
71:24 - js right okay when you are teaching
71:27 - coding to other people
71:29 - you become better a lot faster
71:32 - and even if you're new to coding you can
71:34 - actually help people who are one step
71:36 - behind you because you're going to be a
71:37 - lot more relatable than somebody who has
71:38 - like 10 or 20 years of experience in
71:40 - coding
71:41 - yep and that's one of those things
71:43 - that's going to make just a strong
71:44 - foundation for you and give you that
71:46 - practical
71:46 - income coming in from coding so then you
71:49 - can actually
71:50 - quit your side hustle like if you're
71:51 - doing uber on the side
71:53 - or if you're doing construction work on
71:55 - the side you can stop that and actually
71:57 - spend eight to ten hours a day on coding
71:59 - so that's one tip that i would like to
72:01 - give
72:01 - all of you is figure out a way to make
72:03 - even one dollar from coding
72:05 - when you do that everything changes for
72:08 - you
72:09 - exactly guys and like the best way to do
72:12 - that
72:12 - is literally teach for free like my
72:15 - that's why i would advise you guys
72:17 - whoa dude so terry
72:22 - what insane dude
72:25 - go i think maybe uh can we bring that on
72:27 - the screen
72:30 - so teary just dropped a hundred dollar
72:32 - donation on youtube
72:37 - and he goes so terry can we bring you on
72:40 - here oh there we go
72:41 - nice and so tyra goes hey qazi and sunny
72:46 - graduated as a computer science major
72:48 - and
72:49 - used udemy throughout people really need
72:52 - to get the difference between
72:54 - profit with javascript college and other
72:56 - platforms
72:58 - i would love to join one day on the live
73:00 - with you guys and talk about the
73:01 - enormous values pwj brings love
73:04 - y'all dude we massively appreciate you

73:42 - how's it going good good how are you
73:44 - guys
73:46 - doing fantastic so tell us just a little
73:49 - bit about you and like how
73:51 - before you got into coding you know like
73:54 - what were you doing the last few years i
73:56 - guess
73:57 - so uh guys i'm i'm actually a mom of
74:00 - toddler
74:01 - so i've been uh i used i have done my
74:04 - master's in computer science but that
74:06 - was like whole different like thesis
74:07 - level thing
74:08 - i got into coding few years back but it
74:11 - was like just
74:12 - just for few some years and then i had
74:15 - to drop it
74:16 - now it's like after four years i'm
74:18 - coming back again and
74:19 - it's just because i like coincidentally
74:23 - or fortunately saw this
74:24 - clever programming video in on youtube i
74:27 - was so furious that time i thought
74:29 - why did why did youtube took so much
74:32 - time to show me this video and i just
74:34 - started
74:35 - what was the video i the it was the five
74:39 - days challenge that amazon
74:41 - nice awesome yes
74:44 - i did that and then i immediately joined
74:47 - it
74:47 - so i want to tell want to tell people
74:50 - like
74:51 - like me especially i mean i know all the
74:53 - youngsters
74:54 - they love coding they want to learn so
74:56 - many things
74:58 - but the people who are looking for their
75:00 - career change
75:01 - who are absolutely beginners who are
75:03 - moms who actually
75:05 - like uh just want to do something but
75:07 - they don't have any idea what to do and
75:10 - they are thinking about coding this is
75:12 - the best place you can come to
75:14 - i mean there are lot of things like they
75:16 - have like so many like
75:18 - they have beginners also in term
75:19 - intermediate people also they are
75:20 - advanced level people
75:22 - so they all work together so you know
75:24 - you know what
75:25 - like how to solve your problems you you
75:28 - know you won't be
75:29 - you won't be overwhelmed at all you will
75:32 - be enjoying coding and
75:33 - people will be there to help you
75:36 - exactly wow yeah exactly that's why we
75:39 - try and push for is is more of a course
75:41 - it's more of a community
75:42 - right and it's going to be with you even
75:44 - once you get your job
75:47 - we actually have people who are actually
75:48 - in a full-time position but they still
75:50 - come to those coaching calls
75:51 - they still come and actually come with
75:53 - their problems come with questions like
75:54 - hey sonny
75:55 - i'm in a new role and i don't know how
75:58 - to navigate this huge code base any
76:00 - tricks or tips you could share
76:02 - and those kind of things which pretty
76:03 - much it's not just me answering at that
76:04 - point is every single person inside the
76:06 - community
76:07 - um yeah yeah that's really awesome um so
76:09 - awhile i want to ask you uh
76:11 - if you if somebody is on the fence right
76:13 - now
76:14 - what would be your advice what would you
76:16 - what would you tell them if they were on
76:17 - the fence of joining pwj
76:20 - yes immediately join in i mean you're
76:22 - gonna enjoy it
76:23 - it's you not only gonna learn coding but
76:25 - also like how to communicate
76:27 - this is i mean i'm talking with you guys
76:29 - is one of one kind of a
76:31 - kind of achievement for me i would say i
76:33 - never been like live i have never
76:35 - uh i mean it's really really hard for me
76:38 - like i'm not confident enough to do that
76:40 - but i'm doing that that's one
76:41 - achievement from
76:42 - cleveland give her some words of
76:44 - encouragement in the comments below
76:46 - we have about 500 of people watching
76:50 - her live so guys just drop some love for
76:52 - awani and awan you're doing fantastic by
76:55 - the way like you're doing incredible
76:57 - yeah exactly you guys i mean credit goes
77:01 - to you all
77:02 - all cp community all the mentors all the
77:06 - coaches and even like all like my fellow
77:09 - friends like now they are becoming
77:10 - friends you know like i'm becoming like
77:12 - friends to so many people
77:14 - in the community so it's so great i mean
77:17 - and
77:18 - one more one more thing i want to uh
77:20 - mention
77:21 - see like uh i i'm learning how to
77:23 - question i mean how
77:24 - how we can why we should ask things so i
77:27 - have learned like i have
77:29 - learned that a lot of love coming in by
77:30 - the way like you are amazing
77:33 - daniel is like you're doing amazing
77:34 - thank you for sharing your experience
77:37 - everybody sharing jen yomna all sending
77:40 - heart signs for you
77:42 - thank you guys thank you so much means a
77:44 - lot
77:46 - yeah carry on the money yeah yeah i mean
77:49 - you learn how to question
77:50 - and i mean how to ask question actually
77:53 - because like lot of time you get struck
77:55 - in programming but you don't know how to
77:57 - ask people like how can i get the
77:58 - solution of it so
78:01 - when you go to the community you see
78:02 - like a lot of people are
78:04 - struggling from the same question and
78:07 - then you get the idea and
78:09 - like it will be helpful and it's just
78:11 - one week guys it's just one
78:12 - with me and i actually don't get that
78:15 - much time
78:16 - uh i mean i have a lot of things to like
78:18 - i really get very limited time to
78:20 - uh to code but that that time i
78:24 - actually am able to focus because the
78:26 - content is so good i mean
78:27 - it starts from beginning and then slowly
78:30 - take you take you there
78:31 - and there are like a lot of live calls
78:33 - where where people do fun
78:34 - nazis dancing i love that
78:38 - so i mean yeah i mean it's so much so
78:40 - good i mean i
78:41 - i really would tell all the people
78:44 - especially
78:45 - the ones who are thinking no this course
78:47 - is not for us
78:48 - like they are like just uh getting
78:50 - hesitated that
78:51 - like all the advanced people are there
78:53 - they know already know some coding
78:55 - how would we go there like how we will
78:57 - be doing everything right so i am the i
78:59 - am the example for them
79:01 - i i would say just come and you got
79:03 - really gonna enjoy it people are there
79:04 - to help you
79:05 - it's so good yeah exactly thank you so
79:08 - much
79:09 - i really appreciate you one thing i
79:10 - wanna em and this is something which i
79:12 - think kazi might be valuable to a lot of
79:14 - girls who are willing to join right
79:16 - so one thing i'll tell you guys from
79:18 - industry experience
79:19 - and the developer sort of market is very
79:22 - male dominant right it's very very male
79:23 - dominant at the moment there's a lot
79:25 - more guys who code than girls
79:26 - so one thing i can say is in our
79:28 - community we actually have some insanely
79:30 - talented
79:31 - like women inside of the course and it's
79:32 - really awesome to see that
79:34 - and i can actually say like a lot of our
79:35 - literally a lot of our best developers
79:37 - like jen
79:38 - um like iwanis is now in the course like
79:40 - we have so many amazing
79:42 - so powerful women inside of this course
79:43 - so if you're if you ever see
79:45 - like coding as sort of intimidating
79:47 - because you're you're a girl or or you
79:49 - maybe feel that like you might not fit
79:51 - in then this is something
79:53 - is in there melissa is in there amazing
79:55 - women
79:56 - exactly like and this is where like the
79:58 - support comes in we make it our best
80:00 - effort to make sure that everyone feels
80:02 - comfortable inside there which means
80:04 - in the coaching calls everything so
80:05 - everyone has like a completely
80:07 - like powerful voice inside the community
80:10 - so that's just something i want to
80:11 - highlight um
80:12 - yeah really really awesome to have you
80:13 - inside owani

81:24 - so rapid fire you're 17 years old
81:27 - you're learning coding you're hyped

81:31 - tell us a little bit like why did you
81:33 - join profit with javascript and what
81:35 - would you say to somebody who's on the
81:36 - fence because today's the day the price
81:38 - goes up today is the day
81:39 - where we really just want to go hey if
81:41 - you want to get the best deal it's today
81:43 - a week from now the course doors close
81:46 - and after that we're going to shut the
81:48 - [ __ ] up and not talk about profit with
81:49 - javascript for a really long time
81:51 - yeah and there's going to be no
81:52 - enrollment for profit with javascript
81:54 - and we're just going to go crazy
81:55 - providing
81:56 - value on youtube and helping people and
81:58 - helping people in our program
82:00 - get results the ones who are in the
82:01 - program so if you're getting annoyed
82:02 - right now
82:04 - my apologies but it's just because we
82:06 - really believe that this
82:07 - is the best course on the planet so we
82:09 - want to give you that opportunity to get
82:11 - the best deal
82:12 - and after that nothing from us and we're
82:14 - just going to go back to our like daily

82:19 - so
82:20 - give us a little bit why'd you join it
82:21 - and what's like what would you say to
82:23 - somebody who's thinking about it
82:25 - yeah uh i would like to ask you kazi
82:28 - uh how many models do we have in pwg
82:33 - 15 okay
82:36 - so like we get 15 modules 15 pieces of
82:39 - content to learn right
82:41 - right no wrong
82:45 - why we are having coaching calls
82:49 - every day life coaching first

82:59 - right
82:59 - welcome another student join tondo thank
83:02 - you but keep going fury
83:03 - yeah so even if people are listening to
83:06 - you
83:07 - so even if there are specific number of
83:09 - modules the value
83:11 - is never ending it's unlimited like we
83:13 - have no life cost than the number of
83:15 - days in the week
83:16 - we are literally having live calls every
83:18 - day
83:20 - so the like it's you get lifetime access
83:23 - plus the value is never going to end

94:00 - um
94:00 - mainly i wasn't comfortable talking in
94:02 - front of the camera so
94:04 - this was for me to get over my fear by
94:06 - doing that right now
94:07 - so this is how i'm able to talk to you a
94:10 - lot more confident
94:12 - dope that is freaking exciting there's
94:15 - something beautiful about
94:16 - starting to put out content and speak
94:18 - your confidence level goes up
94:20 - so fast it's weird you're like wait i
94:23 - haven't
94:23 - had this boost in my whole life and all
94:26 - of a sudden in like
94:27 - two weeks you see a big difference we
94:29 - saw a big difference in even some of the
94:31 - people from our community like amanath
94:33 - and he's like now so confident when he
94:35 - speaks
94:36 - so something interesting nasa just told
94:39 - me
94:40 - what did you do to your team treehouse
94:42 - subscription
94:44 - and then i think you also joined profit
94:45 - javascript so talk to me about that
94:48 - i did um basically i messaged you in i
94:51 - think as one of your videos that i was
94:52 - actually on the fence
94:54 - uh so i've gone through team treehouse i
94:56 - did the udemy
94:57 - uh did coursera i did everything
94:59 - basically and
95:01 - one of the main things that pushed me
95:02 - over yesterday was the strength of your
95:04 - community
95:06 - and because i'm looking through my
95:09 - team treehouse and i'm there to finish
95:11 - to full stack
95:12 - uh javascript developer was 36 hours so
95:15 - i looked to that and i went yeah okay i
95:16 - can do 36 hours
95:18 - but three months later it's i'm only on
95:20 - 26 and the problem
95:22 - is is that is that there's no human
95:24 - interaction you're left alone
95:26 - and also you're told to reach out to
95:28 - people via linkedin
95:30 - and you do that and no one gets back to
95:31 - you anyway so
95:33 - i signed off i went over to the fence
95:35 - crossed over
95:37 - and this morning it's been a whirlwind
95:38 - uh you i'm going to the facebook group
95:40 - i've actually gone to your slack
95:42 - and everyone's commented and not left me
95:44 - alone since this morning basically
95:46 - got me into everything that's awesome
95:48 - dude and how did you find the coaching
95:50 - call
95:51 - uh perfect you know it's you know it's
95:54 - it's one of those ones that you don't
95:56 - really expect to be happening
95:58 - and so you know i was i was on the fence
96:00 - thinking is this just another course
96:01 - it's just going to be going through just
96:03 - acceptable money but it's not the case
96:05 - as soon as the payment has gone through
96:06 - and if
96:07 - you start coming through uh satisfaction
96:10 - from there
96:11 - awesome and what would you say to
96:13 - someone who's on the fence of joining
96:15 - like what was it that actually pushed
96:16 - you over the fence
96:18 - and and then some people might be able
96:20 - to relate to that
96:21 - yeah so yesterday's obviously the
96:23 - community strength
96:24 - in that uh so after like yesterday
96:28 - uh because i meant to comment onto your
96:30 - your channel
96:31 - as soon as i signed up i canceled my
96:33 - subscription to team treehouse
96:35 - and so from there that saved me an extra
96:37 - two hundred pound a month
96:38 - that's awesome dude nice damn steep
96:42 - yeah hey listen subscription
96:46 - yeah that is awesome man we're very glad
96:48 - to have you in the community are you
96:50 - gonna make
96:50 - are you ever interested in making coding
96:52 - content
96:54 - yeah definitely um a little bit of
96:56 - background about myself is that
96:58 - i've i was at the very beginning of the
97:00 - birth of the internet and everything
97:01 - from there
97:02 - and also was building html tables
97:05 - the web is built in tables uh i was
97:07 - there when
97:08 - bootstrap came in and foundation first
97:11 - came in
97:12 - so then obviously i changed my career
97:13 - down to uh ux design
97:16 - so and when furlough oh sorry when kevin
97:20 - came in i was furloughed a few months
97:21 - so within that three months i think how
97:23 - can i uh bump up my
97:25 - salary i know can i be more um how can i
97:29 - help the team out a lot more so that's
97:30 - when i started looking into javascript
97:32 - and it's just after i just kind of grind
97:34 - can mature and after that
97:35 - but no so after today uh it's been a war
97:38 - event so guys i'm so glad to be on your
97:40 - course
97:40 - and if you are on the fence just leap

100:36 - 1500.
100:40 - not bad yeah investment
100:44 - yeah it's still still going up tyson
100:47 - says
100:47 - digging the nintendo with the old duck
100:49 - hunt gun in the background
100:51 - that's right that's right you gotta show
100:53 - off your cred
100:55 - i remember when i was really young when
100:57 - i was a baby i used to be like really
100:59 - fat
100:59 - and like i would have a diaper on i'd be
101:01 - running around everywhere in the house
101:03 - and i remember my brothers would always
101:06 - go behind the tv
101:08 - and plug-ins do something with the wires
101:10 - and then you'd be able to play that game
101:12 - where you can like do duck hunt
101:15 - and i didn't know what they did because
101:18 - i was like two years old right i was
101:19 - like so young like one or two years old
101:22 - so i just thought they would go behind
101:23 - the tv and like
101:25 - i so they weren't at home i went behind
101:28 - the tv
101:29 - and i just tried to model what they did
101:30 - so i just took the wires just like
101:32 - randomly like dangled them
101:34 - and came back to the front and i'm like
101:37 - why the hell
101:38 - is this not working why can't i play my
101:40 - duck hunt game
101:41 - i got so angry my brothers walked in on

103:22 - that's it yeah yes yeah so
103:26 - i think some of the people have heard
103:27 - your story but i think that is
103:30 - really inspiring for people and can just
103:33 - give us a little bit of like what you
103:34 - were doing with
103:37 - previously yeah and yeah
103:41 - uh yeah so i was i've been a bartender
103:43 - i've been living in la for about 11
103:45 - years and and i've been making my living
103:46 - as a bartender for like the last 11
103:48 - years
103:49 - and it just like these last couple years
103:50 - i just find myself no matter what job
103:52 - i'm at no matter how much money i'm
103:54 - making
103:55 - when i know i have to go there i'm like
103:57 - [ __ ] this
103:58 - when's it going to be over i don't want
104:00 - to spend eight hours doing this get home
104:02 - at 3am
104:05 - my whole next day's ruined like the
104:07 - whole thing and i was like you know then
104:09 - you mix
104:09 - alcohol with you know some entitled
104:12 - people that come in and you're just like
104:13 - it's just a recipe for an argument or
104:15 - someone's ego for
104:16 - you know it's just like it's not a
104:17 - positive environment more often than not
104:19 - and i was like i don't want to spend my
104:20 - time there but and so on the
104:22 - other side of that i'm also an actor and
104:24 - a writer were you so
104:26 - were you skilled at that stuff could you
104:28 - do like the crazy tricks that they do
104:30 - the bartenders do
104:31 - the best the best trick i ever learned
104:33 - how to do was to blow fire
104:34 - so i like i could take uh i could take a
104:38 - empty bottle of gray goose and roll up
104:40 - roll the napkin up to look kind of like
104:41 - a little flower
104:43 - you dip it in bacardi 151 you light it
104:45 - on fire you take a swig of the bacardi
104:47 - and you just kind of like
104:48 - spit and pull away and like you get this
104:50 - big old fireball so that was kind of fun
104:52 - nice dude yeah yeah yeah no i was good
104:55 - though you know i i knew i could do that
104:57 - at the bar
104:58 - what's that you would do that at the bar
105:01 - only one bar i've ever worked at let us
105:04 - do it there and that's just because
105:05 - they were like we were downtown it was a
105:07 - dive bar
105:08 - and so it was cool but um but yeah
105:11 - multipliers weren't like
105:12 - that's people literally getting lit dude
105:16 - coming out of there they're like yo this
105:18 - [ __ ] is on fire
105:19 - no no it's on fire it was on fire it was
105:23 - cool man
105:24 - uh it was fun but you know aside from
105:26 - like little things like that and stuff
105:29 - like it was just a negative environment
105:30 - and so i like
105:32 - you know i started ever since lockdown
105:34 - had been spending a lot of time like on
105:36 - acting and writing and stuff like that
105:38 - and then i was like well i obviously
105:39 - need to think about when my bar opens up
105:41 - i don't want to go back like i want to
105:43 - be done with that part of my life
105:44 - what else can i do and then you know i
105:46 - just kind of like
105:48 - huh i was just going to add no skill
105:50 - goes
105:52 - every skill can be useful like imagine
105:54 - if you're making a training video
105:56 - and you're like guys today we're going
105:59 - to be learning about
106:00 - firebase
106:04 - totally yeah yeah and you should apply
106:06 - to a job like that you'll be like guys
106:08 - this app that i built for you guys is
106:09 - built with react
106:10 - and firebase can breathe out and let's
106:13 - go
106:14 - bacardi 151 the camera
106:18 - yeah man yeah totally no i mean there's
106:20 - definitely like some skills that i
106:22 - learned as a bartender you know you know
106:24 - learning the gift of gab and socializing
106:26 - and just like i always loved the aspect
106:28 - i got to meet
106:29 - people from all over and you know
106:31 - different people from all around the
106:32 - world and stuff like that that was
106:34 - really cool
106:35 - but um yeah man so so i was uh
106:38 - doing a lot of acting and writing i was
106:39 - like what else can i do i don't want to
106:41 - go back to the bar so i was like well
106:42 - let's take a look at coding and
106:44 - obviously you know like i knew of you
106:46 - quasi through amber lee because she used
106:49 - to train me in boxing i can't wait to
106:50 - get back to that by the way
106:51 - um and so i was so i hit her up and i
106:54 - was like you know is
106:55 - is causie what's the deal i know he's a
106:57 - programmer and stuff and
106:58 - so she told me a little bit about it and
107:00 - i watched you guys videos on youtube and
107:03 - and uh my girlfriend's friend is a
107:06 - programmer as well
107:07 - and like graphic design and stuff like
107:09 - that and so basically i was like what
107:11 - else can i do
107:12 - that's creative that makes decent money
107:16 - but more than anything else i will enjoy
107:19 - so i was like let's give this a shot and
107:22 - i just kind of dove into it and i was
107:23 - like well this is a lot of fun
107:24 - and you know i kind of found myself like
107:26 - going down the rabbit hole for like five
107:28 - hours a day just like
107:29 - messing around making cool little web
107:31 - pages and stuff like that
107:32 - and um you know making little websites
107:35 - for friends and
107:36 - all that kind of stuff and i was like
107:37 - this is [ __ ] great and i don't have
107:39 - to leave the house if i don't want to i
107:40 - don't have to worry about
107:42 - it's pandemic proof you know what i mean
107:44 - yeah and
107:45 - at the end of the day it scratches my
107:47 - you know creative itch
107:49 - so that's why i felt like it was a good
107:50 - fit for me so you know
107:53 - damn that's awesome dude that's awesome
107:55 - bro thanks
107:56 - i really appreciate that we appreciate
107:58 - that story
107:59 - and like how you went from
108:02 - like even you getting interested into
108:04 - coding it's like you kind of just heard
108:07 - it from a friend like your girlfriend's
108:09 - friend right and you were like hey this
108:12 - guy's a graphic designer and doing
108:14 - coding and that got you interested in it
108:15 - and i remember you and i were on a call
108:18 - yeah yeah man i was just like spilling
108:21 - my guts to you and
108:22 - and i was like dude i don't know if it's
108:23 - the right thing for me i already have so
108:25 - much going on i want to be able to find
108:26 - my balance and you're like dude just do
108:27 - it i was like [ __ ] it i'm gonna do it
108:30 - yeah you know
108:33 - i have not got it and so today
108:37 - the price of the program permanently
108:39 - goes up if somebody's thinking about it
108:42 - would you recommend this program to them
108:43 - and i know now you have some experience
108:45 - with the program too because you've been
108:46 - in it
108:47 - yeah yeah i think so definitely like if
108:49 - it's if you want to if you want a
108:51 - program and you want to learn how to do
108:52 - it right
108:53 - then join profit with javascript because
108:57 - not only do you get the classes but like
108:59 - uh wayne said earlier
109:01 - like it's you're joined for the
109:02 - community as well like that's
109:04 - almost more valuable than the class
109:07 - because
109:08 - you don't have a lot of classes where
109:10 - you can get answers if you have a
109:11 - question
109:12 - and like i think that is one of the
109:14 - obviously coding is difficult and you're
109:16 - gonna get confused at times and who do
109:17 - you reach out to if you have a question
109:19 - like
109:19 - this community is has been so incredibly
109:23 - helpful for me so
109:24 - like i love all you guys man it's it's
109:26 - you've made you've made the
109:28 - process of learning something brand new
109:30 - like this
109:31 - a lot of fun so there we are
109:34 - i love that yeah thank you so much
109:36 - brother thank you so much you got it
109:38 - guys
109:38 - love you guys see ya appreciate you bye
109:42 - damn all right guys so i think that's it
109:45 - for
109:46 - for today i hope that you guys enjoyed
109:48 - it got value out of it
109:51 - um is there anything else sunny you
109:53 - think we should talk about or
109:54 - or do you want to end it off with i
109:57 - think the main thing is guys like you
109:59 - saw
109:59 - today like not from like a fancy
110:02 - presentation not from
110:03 - something you know like pre-made it's
110:05 - pretty much real people
110:07 - speaking to you guys that like this
110:09 - course is more than just a course right
110:11 - it's a community
110:12 - it's something which is growing it's
110:14 - it's dynamic it's constantly evolving
110:16 - it's growing it keeps up to date as well
110:18 - with the latest and
110:19 - and newest trends you know like
110:21 - everything is always adapting in web
110:23 - development so
110:24 - we not just us but the community is
110:26 - ahead of trend right so like
110:27 - we're always getting sort of your news
110:29 - feed and things like that now what i
110:30 - want to say is
110:31 - if you haven't or if you're on the fence
110:33 - my personal advice to you guys is
110:36 - regardless if you get it today or if you
110:37 - get like within a few days
110:39 - the point is that doors will close to
110:42 - that community
110:43 - in a week's time so on the 26th we
110:45 - pretty much close the doors
110:46 - and once they're closed we don't know
110:48 - when they're going to open again um
110:50 - so it's very much a case of like if
110:52 - you're on the fence my advice is
110:54 - jump right now i remember 30 day money
110:56 - back guarantee so my advice would be
110:58 - go ahead jump in see what it's like
111:00 - because at least that way you give
111:02 - yourself the option
111:04 - of trying the course otherwise if it
111:06 - closes
111:07 - by the 26th you miss the chance to even
111:10 - test it out right so what's the what's
111:12 - what's better right 30 days of testing
111:14 - something
111:15 - and then if you don't like you can get
111:16 - your money back or just like missing out
111:18 - on the opportunity
111:19 - and then letting it go forever right
111:21 - that's my take on it
111:22 - um but as you can tell guys we're never
111:25 - gonna stop bringing that free value for
111:26 - you guys on youtube so
111:28 - the fire is gonna keep coming and with
111:31 - that said i mean
111:32 - i'm pretty good dude i think i think
111:33 - anything you want to add to that
111:36 - that's it i think you guys have heard
111:38 - enough we really appreciate you we love
111:40 - you
111:41 - today is the last day of the price and
111:43 - then after that
111:44 - week from now doors closed we love you
111:46 - guys we appreciate you
111:48 - this is qazi this is sunny
111:51 - and we will see you in the next video
112:02 - click that button below
112:06 - flick it jump in the course you won't
112:09 - regret it we promise you

Cleaned transcript:

whoa what is up guys how's it going this is qazi from cleverprogrammer.com welcome welcome to the webinar uh welcome to how to become a react javascript developer so excited to have you guys here how are you guys doing what is up vijay dixon says bam vladimir we got ricky he says wow hey all right guys if you guys are here just let me know where you guys are coming in from drop it in the comments below we're gonna be getting sunny live on in just a little bit i hope that the audio works just like expected because it would really suck if it doesn't so let's do this yo frank what is up brother hey miriam guys if you're watching this on you should be watching this on crowdcast if you're watching this on youtube just know that you won't be able to like actually engage with us because we're going to be bringing you guys on live as well and today is going to be just about you know the same more is caught than taught meaning you pick up more by seeing people's behaviors and just being around them than you do by people talking at you so we have usually a lot of trainings and a lot of things like that today is going to be more like you're going to learn from people's personal stories how they became a developer how they started landing clients or landing jobs how to start making an income and i think you're going to pick up a lot more just by hearing those stories and our goal is that hopefully they're inspiring to you hopefully they move you and hopefully they inspire you to become a better developer and show you how you can do it too and how you can land those jobs or clients or make an income with coding things like that does that make sense guys all right with that said i'm gonna go ahead and um invite our boy sunny so let's see i really hope the audio works out okay because that would not be fun if it doesn't hello yo what's going on guys yo what's up sunny how's it going guys damn hold on i cannot hear you let me try again hello hello yeah i can hear you we're good okay all right give us a second guys i still don't think i can hear sunny everyone says audio is good papa react hey what's going on guys yo what's up oh yeah i mean i don't think it's muted it's just nelson what's up it's um good to see you again frank no hold on hold on that's fine it's just just when i put this on there's echo so i don't want that yeah this allows me to hear him but then there's echo so i would rather not i would rather hear him without the echo i know all of you guys can hear him clearly and you guys could hear me clearly as well which i think is fantastic the only problem is when i'm listening to it i'm hearing an echo if i turn sunny no no no i i don't think you're understanding me nas it's my audio that's making me here i know people don't hear it oh [ __ ] yeah i can hear the double okay so maybe if you guys have uh frankie can i get your airpods and maybe that allows me to listen to sunny really weird errors that we get into sometimes guys but that's okay it's part of it's part of our process as part of the debugging that we always have to do exactly i think we go pretty good now i want to connect them to your computer are they connected to your computer with you on ecam okay perfect that would be perfect i've got a new one peppa remix okay getting clear voice guys let me know if you can hear my voice as clear as kazi's or i will adjust the volume on my side so let us know guys where's nes echo yeah we should be able to see we got pinky ms what's up we've got dick dick chancing says react god love you bro thank you very much dude we have frank because i prayed to the demo gods nice give us a sonny beatboxing when did you catch movie boxing all right anish we can hear you both thank you priyanju so raft says yes honey okay awesome nice nice now i can hear you sunny nice oh [ __ ] have you got them inside your headphone yup oh nice let's go dude yes perfect all right guys so let's get this started and what we're also going to do is we are going to be learning through other people's stories as well and seeing what they have achieved and what they have accomplished and i think that's gonna give you guys a lot of context around it exactly all right so if we want to start bringing people on nas frankie if you guys can just go ahead and start inviting people i think that would be the best way to go about it yeah let's do that dude and guys let me actually toggle this good hack on the audio and uh one sec i'm trying to share my screen but i don't think i'm able to are you able to share your screen sunny uh right now oh snap oh [ __ ] nice what's up frank hey i can click it yeah dude if you click on your name it says share screen for me i can share screen if needed okay maybe you can share screen and talk on the webinar let's do it dude so some of the slides yeah let's do it so is it not letting you share the screen because they're not pop it's the share screen is not popping up for me that's what i was saying okay um let's go ahead and oops oh my video's going off okay yeah nice um okay guys let me show you my screen right now sure so i think they can see it now whoa got some echo yeah okay i know i killed it so guys let's go ahead and a lot of you know us this is the clever programming team let me go ahead and drop the side so they can see it right now nice so this is the this is the team this is just some other team guys right like we have a huge amount of people who make the magic behind everything happen so this is just some of the members of the team but give it up for everyone that you know so go ahead and drop it in the comments um and yeah guys a lot of work goes into bringing you guys this value and this knowledge so um yeah let us know if you guys appreciate and love that stuff hey dude i hate how the slides are on google slides oh you can't just hit right on your keyboard yeah i mean i might literally just keep it like i could do it like you command command enter and then you can just hit right okay so there you go or just click it so i think we're still doing this today right quasi we're going to be doing it yes yep so just let everyone know how many people is it that is going to be a part of this opportunity to get that free coaching call so there's actually a free coaching call that means you're going to be holding and if you actually jump in in this webinar during this webinar session if you're one of the first are we doing 50 or 100 was it how many people did we do yeah just the people who can actually join inside of this webinar it's going to be for them yeah so anyone who joins inside of this webinar guys you're gonna actually go ahead and get a free coaching call with me and quasi so that's gonna be super super valuable it's gonna be a chance for you guys to go ahead and speak to us and you're gonna get some uh a lot of value out of that so something to bear in mind before we get kickstarted off so stick to the end if you want to go ahead and see how you can do that and if you guys didn't already know today is the day that we have the final pricing for the course so something to bear in mind um let me go ahead and check it out today guys is the day where profit with javascript price increases permanently and it never comes back down so we want to take a lot of your questions we want to share stories with you of the people and we just want to give you kind of everything you need to be able to know to be able to make a decision for yourself exactly guys so this is going to be a jampacked sort of training we're going to be bringing on loads of people so that because we find the best way of actually showing you a bunch of stuff rather than showing you a bunch of slides just speak to real people who get real results and you guys can pretty much learn from that so uh yeah something to know um we're also going to do a bunch of q a during the session so there's going to be a bunch of opportunity for you guys to go ahead and ask questions you can either do it a few ways you can ask a question in the ask a question button so there's actually a button you can click and and these get upvoted and sort of ranked and that's a really good way of asking a question because it goes ahead and shows us what people want to ask or you can go ahead and just pop it in a comment just remember the comment section is going quite crazy right now so it's kind of hard to keep track of that um okay nice now guys time to focus turn on your phones and do not disturb and let's go ahead and jump into today's training so let me go ahead and actually go through this um can we can we actually is it not working yet or is it still the screenshot isn't working right yeah so my screen share isn't working but we have some people on right now okay so we have some people and this is the cool part guys if you have by the way if you have joined profit with javascript just let us know in the comments section and we want to start bringing people on from the community from the program to be able to just share their stories and their experience so we have melissa actually on nice hi melissa hey how are you good thank you how's it going pretty good awesome and what have you been up to lately um causing trouble that's what i do best nice and what was it that brought you to the community what was it that brought you to pwj let us know let everyone know um i lost my job because of covid um and i decided to try programming and i signed up for a college class and i sucked at it so i went to youtube and found quasi and uh he helped me actually pass that college class um but then i found out he has like y'all created your own program so i joined like right away like i think i watched that youtube for 20 minutes and then i was like wait i need to just join i'm like i bet i could learn better if i just joined this class so i didn't even finish that youtube yeah awesome nice and how do you how have you find your experience because because somebody who's new to pwj yeah i think everybody will be excited to find out i'm totally new to programming and i will say it has helped a ton because getting into the community of people who actually know what they're doing um has really helped in fact we've started a mini group out like of people i just met in pwj and we're working on y'all's projects that we found on youtube like the spotify the netflix like because i couldn't keep ups because i'm way new like i can barely even type um so like just like getting that group of friends and just having a group of friends who know like a little more than me some actually know less and we just kind of help each other out it's amazing and then just getting on all y'all's coaching calls has like made me go from like knowing nothing to i know some now i'm getting there that's it like that's what we aim for is to build that sort of confidence and like she said guys we have communities inside of the community which is insane like i love that i really love that and um how do you find that's helped you out and helped you build your confidence like i'm one of those people that gets frustrated really really really easily but just having like 100 friends or be like girl you can do this come on like i'll jump on zoom i'll show you how to do it like it's just made me not get especially i'm just like hey let's solve this problem so that's awesome nice cause yeah i think you're mike's muted yeah i can't hear him at all yeah we can't hear you oh how about now now you're good there we go damn okay i was like damn i can hear myself but i had muted myself in there that is so amazing that somebody from the community will actually jump on a call with you i think that's one of those things that makes all the difference in the world there are programs that i am in and where i'm trying to learn like more about business and how to grow business and how to help people and even they will never actually get on calls with you or the peers and if a peer can get on a call with me i feel like that just takes everything that i'm doing to the next level so that's really cool i would suggest if you are gonna join us also download zoom because that screen sharing button is amazing right now exactly zoom skills yeah and screen brush is another good one we use uh which which might be handy for you to use oh yeah that's awesome you just roll over the screen oh yes green brush is really cool so melissa before we move on because we have more people lined up if somebody is on the fence would you recommend this course to other people now that you've had especially some chance to go through it oh my gosh yes anybody and everybody this class makes it so much easier even if you want to take like a different class because your friends are doing it join this one too because then you have friends to help you with that one nice because i'm the one that like joined like five different programs like don't do that but yeah nice but like yeah like just having the community and then being able to go through like the modules at your own course like you might hear like you need to hurry through them no like actually go through them and learn them that has actually helped me so much just being able to learn it at my own pace and not have a professor be like you got to learn it right now and i'm like you know and then like like i don't know like uh like having all the community rooms like if i'm stuck on this i can go to this room and be like hey and all these people know about it like that has helped tremendously like just knowing which group to talk to yeah we actually introduced module rooms so you've got module one two three and then them rooms are pretty good a lot of students found that was really useful so yeah that's awesome nice thank you so much melissa for coming on really appreciate you thank you thank you so much man i keep hitting that x button too quickly so what i want to also do is i want to bring on some people who also maybe aren't in profit with javascript but you have some questions you want to ask i want to address your guys's question on the call so i invited two people right now ken and i think one more person at the top so somebody asks what are the classes and how are they scheduled tenzing asks so when it comes to the classes guys there this course is prerecorded with trainings which means you can take it at your own pace even if you're a complete beginner you can take it at your own pace and be fine even the live three live coaching calls that we do every single week you can take that at your own pace as well meaning like they're prerecorded they get recorded afterwards and we'll put them in the module so you can take them then at your own pace or if you can make it to the live call that's even better you'll get a better experience exactly so before we bring on atharva just one second yeah so to mention that guys we have 15 modules so there's loads of prerecorded training content and yeah we have weekly coaching course up to four weekly coaching calls at the moment and they're gonna be that's an opportunity for you to ask a bunch of questions interact with us get to know us a bit more really really hey ken how's it going my man good yo what's up ken so what's uh i know you're in the webinar do you have any questions or anything you want to address while you're here on the call with us and nice having you on here by the way oh thank you welcome dude i'm just trying to pay for the course through the payment plan nice yeah because i haven't been paid in two weeks so i'm out of money right yep yeah so a payment plan is something that would help you out right right okay just so are you aware that we have a threemonth payment plan yes got it awesome there's also actually another option um you can use it and i've actually recommended it to a few people is if you pay with paypal people actually offer six month financing i think with paypal credit if it's available in your in your area so that's something that actually might be quite useful and zero percent so that's really useful yeah that's definitely gonna be and what was it that made you sort of uh on what was it that got you interested in profit with javascript oh yes well for years i would have been a sql developer i got that job a long time ago and i couldn't get it back right so i was like let's try something different okay i'm trying to ignore javascript for the longest because i believe it wasn't no money in it yeah until i saw you guys nice awesome dude and uh so a few things i'd like to ask what's your why and why do you think pwj is going to help you or why is it going to help you get to that why all right well right now i'm disabled okay because i lost that job because i was disabled right yeah because i couldn't go to work right and i figured that if i can work from home and like program on my own make my own money i'm not be worried about being fired from a job because i'm disabled now yeah right damn bro yeah damn it so that's a good reason to be in this program and bro we definitely got your back just most important thing is when you're in this program like are you able to put in between 10 to 40 hours a week yes i am okay the more time you can put in the better the results you're gonna get and in the shorter time frame you're gonna get them because like i've said even on the instagram yesterday i just posted this because i was like i feel like some people are starting to get this idea that it's a magic pill and it isn't it requires a tremendous amount of hard work and there's a lot of failure you have to go through but the students that succeed in the program are the ones who keep failing keep trying new things never stop get help from the community use the courses reference material build projects keep trying and then that cycle of that work build reach out work build reach up like nonstop cycle that's what creates those disproportionate results for them over time okay this sounds good i did for sticker once yeah yeah i learned oracle and the one from microsoft sql server right got you yeah because even even in those coaching calls that we pretty much exactly what cars you play that's what we like always try and instill like it's like guys like we said like it's not always like a course isn't going to be the magic pill that's going to transform your life what the course is offering is a community like a space for you to really flourish and sort of grow right and we sort of help you we provide you like with the guidelines and then we provide the content on top of that right so it's a lot more than just like material inside of a course that's why i really don't see like much benefit in like a lot of udemy courses because most of the time i would end up having a like a question i want to ask or like you know you're gonna have some kind of like some kind of thing which you're interested in but you have no idea like how to even ask the question to begin with and i guarantee if you go ahead and ask somebody on on udemy you're not going to get a reply right like this yeah it's going to be a huge while right yes so there you go man like i'm happy for you to jump in the program i'm pumped for you thank you so much for coming on ken you're welcome again appreciate you dude appreciate it all right and join the join the program uh and if you join it during this time we sonny and i definitely want to get on a coaching call with you okay okay thank you so much i really appreciate it awesome dude i'll see you in the program again um i gotta get better on my timing i swear to god yo srikar how are you doing what's up hey i can't hear you can you hear me yeah yeah we can hear you all good see if we can uh get your mic figured out but srikar was in the chat and he was like yo guys pwj is the best community that helps people with any debugging issues they have a great curriculum and has given many jobs what are you waiting for and guys when it comes to getting jobs or getting work or getting clients i just want to emphasize that you have to enjoy coding if you are doing something else and you only see it as a vehicle to your freedom and making money do don't go towards coding they're a lot easier and better ways to make money like if that's your primary goal i would say like learn business like learn how to sell your own things maybe like learn ecommerce there's tons of ways you can make an income that's a lot easier than learning coding even i watched this video i randomly came across and it was so random i typed in rafikaze on youtube because i just wanted to see like my personal brand video that i recently created right so i'm going through youtube and i see garyvee's video under rafikaze which was super weird and it says i can't code and he goes you can't sell crap and i clicked on that video and i started watching garyvee's video in one minute 40 seconds and he literally says i wanted to become a python developer but i can't oh [ __ ] nice yes i was like damn yeah because even gary vee sometimes you know he admits that he can't learn coding and it's because he doesn't probably enjoy it yeah so if you don't enjoy it don't force yourself to do it what i want you guys to go after is really find what you actually enjoy about coding is it the actual process of sitting down and coding is it the process of you writing out your ideas on a whiteboard and coming up with what you can build is it working with the team of people and coming up with what kind of app you guys can build and then breaking that apart down for me it was always the problem solving that fascinated me about coding and by the way guys the profit with javascript uh button is below so if you guys want to join you can click there and i do want to let you guys know that today is the last day of the price that it's at and then by tonight it's going to increase so that's something i want to let you guys know if you guys want to join it just click it we will see inside the program but i'm going to continue with what i was saying and for me the problem solving is something that's fascinating to me and i absolutely love which is why i really love chess too i don't know if you guys like chess but sonny do you play chess uh i mean i dabble with that i need to i i'll definitely have a game but it'll be fun yeah i'll play you blindfold minecraft let's go yeah so yeah with chess it allows me to go in this flow state and think for a really long period of time and that's what makes chess fun for me and for a lot of people maybe even for you sonny coding is fun because it lets you hit when you're two hours in or three hours in and you're in that flow state yeah right dude that flow state is something else and that's something which i like even if i would say this is my advice right even if you don't enjoy coding like always give something a try with 110 right like you can't say you you don't like something if you give it 90 i just don't feel like you've fully gone into it right and coding is one of those things you're gonna kind of hit a wall at some point like it's guaranteed you're gonna hit a wall and i would say i'd recommend at least give that wall a fair amount of time before you kind of say okay this isn't for me and like what i would say is when you get into that flow state guys that's really when you're going to really start all right yeah you guys hear dj khaled going another one did you oh no no no i didn't is that what you've got in your text message yeah every time we get a student to enroll in pwj i have dj khaled going another word like let's go the family grows baby i'm gonna i'm gonna do the same thing that's good yeah classic lip yeah just joined welcome to the program john exactly awesome dude and and remember like another reminder guys that this is today is the last time you will get the price that you see uh from this bun after today it goes up and we didn't lie last time and we're not lying today it's going to go up yeah so let's bring on other people so atharva what is going on my man talk to us about what got you into coding and what got you into profit with javascript and welcome welcome dude we spoke together nice yeah we spoke yeah so what brought me into coding like i was 10 years old and my brother used to learn c plus plus and i was like hey i want to do the same and i would never get his books so one day i just stole his book and just started reading and it was so interesting like according to me i just read the entire book in just two days and it was so yeah and i just started to do some other coding languages like visual basic like i didn't know that it was like outdated thing i was just into coding so i just started doing that and it was fun and like you actually make something and like you have an idea and you make it happen that's that's so important and that's so good about programming that you can make things happen and i just move on and i'm now 19 and i know javascript i know php and that's so good but but the real thing is i was never surrounded by developers and a community like this so i decided that i would just go into profit of javascript and guys i was the one who wasn't fans in the previous webinar so i didn't have the chance because my dad was sleeping and i wanted to take this for sure so i thought like okay so we have to pay hundred dollars more but then when i woke up i saw the price didn't change and i was like oh no i'm just taking this now you woke up the same day for us it was the same day you're losing yeah i thought well dude like i'm so glad that you took that jump and like from from i think it's really cool because a lot of people are in your position that you're in a week ago right now so what would you what would be your advice to them if they're sitting on the fence and they're not sure about joining or not joining right if you are on the fence you should know that you will never get any community like this if you go on stack overflow you post a question then people will answer this but nobody will give you an answer they will it will all be are you dumb don't you know how to do things it's like no dude that that doesn't mean how the things work they would even say that this is already answered go to this page no that's not how things work in the community in the slack community um there are people who get doubts every day and there are beginners one is duplicate even yeah yeah in the slack community even if people don't know the answer they are very happy to help because in the process they also learn something and that's very important like if you try to answer something and you you are into that problem and then you know how to solve it at the end of the day you look at the threads you know how to solve it and that's what we have for like the modules are also good but the community best part you can ever have and the coaching calls is also the good part of it because in coaching calls you get a huge value bombs and you can ask any question anytime like no one is there to stop you you just raise your hand in zoom call and you get your question answered that's awesome people like that you actually saw the coaching call this week right you jumped in both i think right you were in both coaching yeah i jumped into both coaching calls and i uh in one of the coaching calls i even made a video and shared with the oh yeah yeah yeah dude thank you so much for coming on i know we jumped on ig live yesterday too so i'm pumped thank you yeah i'll see you again on ig live dude thank you so much for joining all right brother take care take care bro um i'm really curious to hear some of the people's uh stories as well i can't share my screen but maybe sunny you can also share screen and show the actual page cleverprogrammer.com pwj let's do it dude so i'm gonna go ahead and show my screen right now for you guys boom there we go so you guys should be able to see the screen no yep now we can see it so you guys can see the link at the bottom of you want to clear your screen brush uh can you see oh yeah oh god damn it yeah there you go um right so right 500 now yeah so right now guys we pretty much uh like you can see we have 12 hours left right so pretty much and to be honest i think maybe at the end of this uh we usually actually ended this webinar might be jumping that price up so um if you go ahead and join the benefit is right if you join the course right now in this webinar me you're going to get a coaching call with me and kazi which we don't offer to everyone right that's going to be an exclusive thing for you guys inside this webinar right now and something i want to show you guys so the the course itself consists of a bunch of stuff guys you've got 15 modules and these are going to be like it does not matter if you are a complete beginner you're going to get pretty much brought up to that standard of where you're coding you're basically creating your own projects we have weekly javascript and react coaching calls so that includes myself every tuesday we have nars i think on saturdays and then we have the the success coaches so success coaches are huge guys like they're going to provide you personal personalized video feedback on every single one of your assignments so this is something that you don't get on stack overflow or you don't get this on a udemy course you're not going to get somebody actually drop you a video saying this is awesome what you've done over here but this bit of code can be written a bit differently you're gonna get that inside the course and i don't i mean until this day i don't know anywhere i've tried to find other places i'm yet to find somewhere that actually gives you proper personalized video feedback and on top of that guys we're going to show you how to make money from it okay so to consider as an investment in yourself we're going to go ahead and teach you how to make money now you don't have to take our word on it we pretty much have like a bunch of bills that you guys have seen you guys are going to go ahead and be able to create all of these builds we actually have so many people inside the course right now like frank you're going to be up to speed can you show the amazon one by the way uh yeah dude let's do it so this one right here is nice yeah this one's still damn would you guys like to learn how to make that exactly guys if you want to know how to build this stuff including all the functionality you can see right now full ecommerce functionality then we go ahead and we're going to show you how to do all of that this guy even added the animations dude i love this build i love this uh we have a few questions too so somebody says how much time will it take to become a react gs developer the clip zone asks so it's a very good question um maybe we should wait let's come back on the screen and we can answer it um and by the way a week from now the doors close to the program so that's something i also want to let you guys know yeah exactly so a week from now our doors completely closed we do that to keep the quality of the students very high um so right now like where we have the doors open but in a week's time we're going to close that stuff and pretty much we're not going to open up again maybe for a few months maybe for a year we don't know yet we pretty much we're not sure on that but we like to keep our community very powerful very positive and to do that that's why we do it this way now the to answer your question to become a react developer my advice guys is if you can go ahead um and it's all about how much time you're willing to put in right so if let's say you join the course today and you put in two hours a week now i can't promise you in a year's time you're gonna even be a developer right like because then you're gonna need to point some serious work like when i'm talking serious work i'm like kazi said before uh to ken i think it was who jumped on like it's going to take another person jumping in lovely michael let's go we just got michael enrolled in profit with javascript awesome dude welcome to the course nice so yeah you're gonna pretty much if you're gonna like i would recommend dedicating imagine you had a day job right that's eight hours a day right consider that as your minimum i would say like if you really want to grow give it your give it some serious time like make it consider it not just like a little side hobby something like that if you want this to become your fulltime income then dedicate and treat it like a fulltime job right like give it that same amount of hours and then in my in my personal opinion i believe i honestly believe if you follow we have a nice little road map and i usually teach a way that you can actually start earning money during the three months that i would actually predict that you could become a developer very intense three months right like i wouldn't say it works for everyone three months but you can pretty much make it work in three months but you can pretty much go ahead and actually in your first month's stuff roadmap that you and i we showed last time too and it's basically like imagine if a timeline is like this right yeah you can spend three months actually learning the skills and building the projects and the next three months actually working on applying for jobs and you're applying for jobs that are probably around between 40 to sixty thousand dollar a year range exactly a complete beginner oh crap i totally forgot i'm sorry we have luke i wanna bring on some of the people here so luke uh he's like hey this is one of the newbies from the program if you wanna get our experience how are you doing yeah what up what up here's henry yeah man can you hear me awesome yeah i know uh yeah i've been trying to grow this out but i know uh pretty much i've been on the fence for quite some time i think i actually sent on two emails to you guys uh to like the supports that just to see like what i was truly getting um because you know 600 it is an investment obviously so you know some people cannot afford it or some people are just like debating and they're on the fence over the price but for me like learning all the modules um not just the twitter but like eventually zoom spotify netflix going more in depth and just what's on the youtube content and then as well as like the weekly coaching calls like those have been like amazing i haven't been able to participate in them yet um but i do the i rewatch them so every single one is like recording you can just rewatch them so that has been fantastic and then obviously the community like i've done so just i guess for everybody else is on the fence or if they're just wondering um i've done udemy courses i've done youtube tutorials um i've paid for all like other classes as well and what's different is just like the whole community like you get a udemy course and ever it's prerecorded same thing here but like the community is a lot different and you to me like you don't really get like the interaction that you guys get here every single day i log on to slack you can see like 100 missed messages everyone's just constantly like asking questions you know like everyone's always communicating over and saying something like everyone at least is answering questions or working on something um recently i found out that there's like weekly homework assignments too like somebody was working like a tip calculator and things like that and that's just something that you don't get with udemy courses you know udemy courses they do two or three projects and that's about it so that's obviously like that luke give me a little bit of like give me a little bit of your background so before this program yo rami what's going on man i'll call you up in a second so give me a little bit of your background before this right who is who is luke like what just tell us give us a little bit about you uh all right so let's see here i started out pretty much working like a restaurant and hospitality industry um i worked my way up through like a server through bartender eventually moved up into management um anyone that knows a part of the restaurant industry like you know you're working hard you're you know you have 12 14 16 hour shifts you're busting your ass you know so i don't know if i'm not allowed to swear or not but you're busting you know i swear as much as you [ __ ] want all right um but yeah you know you're hustling you're busting you know everyone knows the industry you don't get weekends off you don't get holidays off none of that you know if you got to work a 10hour shift guess what you're working a 10hour shift a 12hour shift 14hour shift so and then i uh came across a bunch of youtube videos about coding it kind of sparked my interest oddly enough i started with like python i couldn't really get it to set up properly i think i spent like a week on it gave up and then like a following a month i did like a lot more research uh seeing which path i wanted to go down ended up coming up with uh javascript so i did html css javascript and i've been selftaught for like the past five months now so pretty much looking forward to kind of make that change and uh landing some clients so i decided to jump on board nice your main motivation was to land the clients it was actually selftaught javascript five months progress and then you wanted to take it to that next level and actually income right so you actually jumped in the course that's awesome dude really really awesome yeah yeah yeah that's pretty much it um like i said like i would love to like lease land clients so that way i could become a fulltime developer you know not have to go to work but right now i have like a ninetofive job so i'm doing that and then i'm spending two three hours four hours a day uh coding also afterwards so why are you coding why what's your goal why do you need to make an income you know why couldn't you just be doing the job at the hospital you know in the hospitality and all that uh the quality of life man that just all it is uh coding allows you to i mean if you're a freelance and you get to work from everywhere you know from anywhere in the world that you want you get to set your own hours yeah you have to have your own discipline and you know determination to make that happen obviously nothing's going to be handed to you on the plate um so even if people are saying like oh yeah be cool to work from vacate like you know in florida or miami or bali or germany like wherever you want to work from like yeah but you still have to hustle like you still have to work hard you know like one way or another you have to work right yeah um but yeah no creating the quality of life setting my own hours um you know pretty much charging you know people whatever i would want to charge what i think my worth what my time you know i think it's worth to them um and that's huge and it's also it's like uh you know people in the past that like trade skills are important like manufacturing cnc cad work steel work well now as we go towards the future technology is going to be like those trade skills you know technology is everywhere i mean it's on dishwashers now you can have lcd little panels on refrigerators like it's crazy like it's going to be everywhere so like being a part of that chain is important so so i have a question for you how much time have you been able to spend in profit with javascript uh with profit with javascript i want to say maybe with like 10 20 hours not much i literally joined i think uh two or three days ago i want to say um so i haven't been able to spend too much time but uh just navigating 20 hours that you spent what's your experience been like and would you actually recommend it to somebody oh yeah no absolutely it's been it's been phenomenal like i said like the community itself has been phenomenal asking a lot of questions you get a lot of feedback um everyone is like responsive so that's been great and the amount of knowledge that you can actually get out of the single course like it's worth it like that's what pushed me over the edge i'm just saying that value and just constantly you know having that available and lifetime access like you it's a huge value say i would definitely absolutely recommend it it's like one of those like listen you also it's an investment in yourself like it is you know to some people it can be like a lot of money but it just that's an extra motivation for you all right if you're gonna pay something like that you might as well get that worth out of it you know that value out of it so that's a really good point then kazi actually said that to me as well before in in in the previous webinar like if you get something for free guys like we all treat that free thing like like [ __ ] like pretty much none of us another student let's go price is going up man if you are on the fence what are you doing jump in we have a 30 day money back guarantee too exactly what's up right now uh ronald ceballos welcome to the family uh yeah so exactly yeah if you if you get something for free your investment in that like whether it's a product or whatever it is your investment in that is very everybody who wins our challenge the first place yep they don't even show up to the calls yeah i can actually say yeah that's a really good point yeah exactly so like literally the people who actually buy the course that i can tell you because i personally see them on the calls right they literally they turn up they show up they want to invest they want to complete the modules they want to go back to the modules because they paid for those modules and then they want to do it again right and that's what is going to push you that motivation that drive all of those things so like exactly like exactly luke said like it's an investment in yourself and that investment is further than just the course it's going to push you and be your actual main mode especially in the beginning of your journey yeah thank you so much for coming on luke really appreciate it no problem no problem and thanks for having me on looking forward to the coaching call later see you later so somebody asked tyson asked he goes hey do we cover loops and variables and you know all these basic functions like do we cover basics so i guess let's have joe diaz let us know if we do cover them or not good good way of doing that dude nice what's up joe how's it going hey what's going on brother holy [ __ ] i love i love your energy bro it's amazing it's so good so what's going on so somebody asked if we cover loops and variables and arrays and like basics do we cover them or we do we not in the course no we don't we don't cover all that [ __ ] yeah you gotta pay to find out get enrolled in the i would have seen that no seriously i mean we cover all the basics this course by far you start with the basics you learn html those are the building blocks as someone was asking on the post you know hey can i study can i be a good react developer well don't get to react yet just get the html css part solidified first because that's the building blocks of react then you learn javascript and then they all combine together you know you can learn react and uh to get back to what the others are saying is you know this community is awesome and the one thing i like about this community is the i get to get involved with people getting into problems you know issues like yesterday we were debugging for nearly i guess uh four forty minute sessions with ronak kumar and we identified that uh his amazon clone after his after he would deploy it to come up with a blank page and for the life of me and leaf we couldn't figure out what's going on so it was a comment in the props that was causing the issue right so we so we went through the we went through the project we went through a fake deploy hello world we stripped everything down we deployed it it was coming up fine then we put pieces together one at a time and then as soon as he put put his checking checkout page it had the comment boom we figured it out so we then lift leaf was able to find that that was this is a known bug and it's been logged in and react so now you know you know it's like i would know that so and anyone the community runs into similar issue i have the resolution so that's what i like about this community is solving problems of people that encounter you know take time to go through the code this you guys whoever's on the fence this is not something that you can find on stack overflow or any udemy or i know udacity or whatever that's just recorded courses that uh you know you play and you learn you get what you get pretty much right thank you bro i appreciate your words and i think that's really cool what you and leaf you guys were working on it together yep last night nice nice how long were you up until last night uh maybe 1 30 2 a.m coding coding yeah i need to get i was i was working on my clone as well so i thought i'll jump on this issue and i'll you know front load if i get run into the issue i'll know what the problem is so how was the call yesterday with nas on the resume oh awesome i got an awesome feedback so i'm working on that as well very constructive feedback and you know i wanted to ask nasu if you can send me a copy of his resume so just to have it yeah um so yeah a copy of your resume so you can have it nice and there you go right there you can see the the all in all anyone who's on the fence i know you have to decide if once the door closes that's it game over exactly guys what if they just want to keep walking on the fence you know good luck you know good luck in total hell damn yeah either either if you love joe drop it in the comments and let us know we love you i think joe just go is literally like a person who's showing you guys that like it's more than just like a course it's like like joe like literally was able to pair a program with leaf yesterday and they were able to like overcome that issue in the coaching call he got a bunch of value from that with the resume and work on that stuff like it's more than just a course you know like it's a lot more than just like just a simple course and like joe joe is literally somebody who comes on every time and like his energy is literally it's radiated throughout the community and if anyone doesn't know linkedin review of a resume cost about 1500 bucks professional review dude that's actually yeah sure that's incredible yeah if if if you do if you if you do a resume review with the course i mean that's so much value ad that you get not just just the module it's just you know the community the value add that you get i didn't know said um on linkedin if you want to get a professional resume review it's 1500 bucks are you serious the [ __ ] are you doing giving it away for free bro damn joe what was that was yesterday's call helpful for you was that yes very much yes awesome love it love it bro nice oh rami is like what the [ __ ] knows all right guys um so joe thank you so much for coming on brother really really appreciate you anytime brother take care thank you dude take care all right yeah resumes are pretty important you know it's like one of those one pieces of paper that can actually like land you an actual job by somebody seeing it and yes i remember yesterday i was on the live stream too where nas was actually sharing that and as somebody asked in the comments you're like i've won so many coding competitions and i've like built so many projects and my resume my cv is five pages long and i remember commenting back and i was like no parth elon musk cv is one page exactly you gotta get it down to one page yeah exactly and the truth is that guys if you handed me a cv with five pages i wouldn't i'm i'm telling you right now i wouldn't read it like as in like as in the truth is but if you showed me a website saying that this is my portfolio and here's my apps that would impress me that would show me some stuff like then i would actually go ahead and play with it we kind of show you all that we tell you the shortcuts we tell you the actual reality because the the reality is i think i think the way that we're taught from like school and the education system is broken like it's not reality it doesn't show you reality it doesn't show you how it actually go the conversation actually happens when you when you leave university or when you go through those sort of modules because they promise you like okay you're gonna get the degree and you're to go outside and then you're going to wave this piece of paper and somebody's going to give you a job right and you're going to pretty much put all of that piece of paper in the fancy details on a piece of paper which we call our resume and that's going to go and land your job and the truth is it doesn't work like that okay like so miriam said i think two pages are more than enough i couldn't agree more i think if you get your resume two pages is more than enough any more than two pages you're overshooting like because then maybe yeah i have a link saying here's a here's my website go and check that out if you want to find out more but yeah so let's start taking on some questions as well so if you guys have questions start dropping them and we want to take them on so one of the questions is hey can i directly go with react javascript or should i learn javascript first um so what was that so either react to javascript she asked which one should i learn first can i so basically somebody's asking can i directly start learning react or do i need to learn javascript first so um my advice is yo what's up corey yeah my advice would be for that go ahead and learn the fundamentals first right it's like you're trying to ask can i build a mansion or should i build a house first like you need to know you need to pretty much go ahead and like learn the fundamentals like get know how to build the foundations and the foundations in this case are html and absolutely basics of javascript you don't have to become a javascript pro but the basics of javascript because what i thought one of my mentors i remember in 2017 no not 2017 2016 when i was picking up a lot of the coding skills he's like don't even think about react until you spend three or four more years learning coding and reading clean code and reading all these like books on algorithms and data structures no i see like i would like scream at that and say go the other way like i would say spend like i would think boxing why would you [ __ ] yeah i know like you just like throw that over like like honestly guys like literally the basics like once you know the basics once you can get pretty much a web page and a button click fun functional why wait jump into react because react is a library that you're using with javascript right so when you're using react naturally your javascript is going to improve right it's going to get better it's going to improve so why the hell are you going to waste your time doing the things separately when your javascript can improve either way when you're doing react oops sonny i just got a great idea yo frank thanks for the 5 donation bro let's go thank you oh nice yeah so i just got actually a really epic idea sunny and i think let me know what you think but i one thing i want to actually try is maybe on a weekend we just do a crowd casting like this so it's easy to bring people on the live with us yep and maybe we just have them apply and build profiles so for example you literally help them build a profile on hired.com oh yeah that'd be dope see what i'm saying yeah and also we help them with like you know some of them maybe i can help them with writing their posts to get freelancing jobs dude that would be insane i think that would be super valuable and i think that would actually help people even um if whoever's got experience in like up work can go ahead and teach how to use up work and set up an upward profile those sort of things or take lessons.com or yzan uh if they're based in united us you know like any of those platforms we can pretty much go ahead and set them up live on a call i think that would be awesome yeah seriously yeah um that would be awesome dude let's go ahead and what's that she got you some nice water yeah she stole my water and i messaged the thing bring back my wall everybody's replying to paul in the comments because paul like was writing these long comments about like what we're doing is wrong trying to get people in profit with javascript and he's like they're just trying to sell their course and going crazy and so i see a bunch of people replying to him and i like vlad's comment and he goes actually they're trying to shorten the time you would have to invest to learn javascript yeah i was buying udemy courses and skills skillshare subscriptions but nothing compares with pwj here we have a community and being a part of this community keeps me motivated all the time we got live calls who else does live calls for the students every week he goes like qazi said it is the best javascript course on the planet exactly dude i don't i don't know if it's my mic actually my your mic what's up what's with your mic oh no we're good we're good yeah we cut out for a little bit um yeah dude i think that's an awesome comment hey another student let's go hey i need to i do i need to add that oh man then nas came to run over to like he's like where's the song playing he came he thought somebody spotify was playing welcome i kill up you thank you dude for joining how are you doing bro i'll come to the phone yep oh so people are like dude i would that would be actually a good idea uh like us doing the live call and actually helping people on the live call yeah venky asks do you cover dev ops are we planning to cover devops in this course or no so right now our focus is mainly on react bringing you as much react value as possible damn his setup was sick that's what i was like we just found our freaking cp new cp team member yeah i like that sound yeah i'm actually doing my wednesday so stay tuned guys i mean wayne if you want to make you know we're we are looking for a content creator yeah he had a perfect live streaming setup right there yeah yeah all right let me see if we can take on another question okay let's see any prerequisites for this course um no dude so you can actually if you've never heard of code before you don't even know where to begin with coding you have no idea how to build a website this is the place for you we're pretty much we will take you or what will literally hold your hand teach you all the foundations for the fundamentals for html css javascript and with that we will pair you with the right the correct knowledge as to how to use those skills and become like somewhat of a a sellable asset to somebody else so like you can actually go ahead and make some money with the skills that you learn right so we're gonna go ahead and teach you that and then on top of that we pretty much then upgrade your knowledge by layering react on top and hey let's go i'm still on youtube yeah can you see me can you hear me yeah yeah wait oh i can hear okay so i can hear awani i'm so confused right now what is going on oh sonny is gone can can you guys hear me yeah hey let's go we got the family growing you're taking me hey right now guys welcome to profit with javascript we are so excited to have you in the program kazi you're gone who's gone crowd we can see sunny i just see qazi sunny is disconnecting yo priyanshu how are you doing hey man oh okay i'm back there we go there we go now we can see everybody priyanshu talk to us man first of all just give us a little bit of background what got you into coding how old you are how old you were when you got into coding give us a little bit of your background bro so everyone i'm priyanji siraj i'm from india i'm 13 years old and i have around two years of experience actually i would say i had around one years of experience i got into coding when i was 11 when i when i was exactly 11 that was my birthday when i got into coding and um it was actually clever programmer themselves who got me into coding so that was amazing then um this one it's all went on i thought that coding was cool and i started learning python and after a few months of uh learning python i got stuck into tutorial help so that was like the worst thing that you can possibly imagine now uh what actually happened was that i didn't code for uh six months straight like no coding at all so that was kind of me so and then suddenly all of a sudden this forward situation comes in and i also have a really good friend who helped me out and he told me that yeah you can do it man you can you can do it just crush it and then uh you discover thing it and you guys started off with the google maps challenge i was so so like i was hell inspired yeah i just make this i get my portfolio up and running i'll show my parents that i can do the second show everyone that i can do this and i made it but that time i didn't actually even anything so like i was actually delayed and then i was learning more about javascript and then came their live streams of react really impressive like seems they're still on youtube you can all go check it out and then this amazon challenge came this was like the best thing that happened to me ever so i learned about react i learned about react context i learned everything about riyadh that i need to know and after that guess what on 12 september at midnight uh for it for india it was 13 september the midnight so i jumped on a live call with sunny himself and he that was like enough for heaven for me after that the next thing i know sunny took me into pwj for free that's it dude it was your answer like disagree on what you just said that all of the people who get the course for free don't even show up i have showed up in literally all of the calls and i've sucked through even though it was like 2 20 a.m 3 a.m or something and all of them are jampacked with value i'm already towards module 8 of the course and it's going amazing like if you guys are actually on the fence like everyone else has said even i'll see the same thing the two most valuable things that you have actually three are success coaches the community itself and the live streams guys this is highly neglected and i'll tell you the difference between any udemy course in them in a i have actually bought several udemy courses myself and what happens is that you tend to check out more about programming yourself right i was on this flutter course recently and i had and they showed me how to build a hello world application in flutter now i wanted to add some more widgets to it but what happened like any night it would happen to any one of you the same thing happened with me i tried to play around with the code and i and i messed up i didn't have anyone in the entire world to help me and i felt like i was already in the grave but these guys the difference between them and everyone else is that the live streams that they have they have separate q a session for you so like you will get you'll get to speak with sunny you'll get to speak with nas and you will be able to clear all your doubts out like i i am making some uh word uh word application so that the next time i hop on a stream with a nas or sunny i can actually ask them my questions and like you have to it's not some people even think that okay i bought this course now it's going to be there with me for my lifetime i'll just keep it aside i'll do my stuff right now guys that's not at all how it's how it's supposed to be like i even though my exams are going on i'm still putting in like as much as i can like i'm putting in four hours i can get five hours and i'm trying to make these uh word applications so that even i can be there in those streams and i can actually clear out my doubts the clouds that i have and i and the best part about the stream is with nas at the end you guys get to party like anything like think about think about it like the best day in your world like every other thursday that's how good it is guys that's awesome dude i love your energy dude thank you man i appreciate you and not you know not everybody has that and so i think that's really important because even when you talked about qazi it's not true you can give a free course to somebody i think you were an exception and sunny saw that and that's why he like kind of picked you out and he was like yo let's go but honest truth is unfortunately in most of the situations when people get things for free they don't appreciate it and i am actually not i am the same way as well myself like yeah that happens to me too like i tend to always like think about it to be given to me for granted and like several others do that too like think about it buying a fake bed from uh the roadside and buying a bed from louis vuitton think about it like that which one would you uh care more like you would also always care more about the louis vuitton bed not just because of how how expensive it was but also because the quality that you're getting right so it's the same thing over here like these guys actually like push you until you are actually like a good developer they're always like as sonny says they're always there holding your hands and walking you through and that is something that's i i've never seen that in any course ever ever dude i i love the uh the the comparisons you come with that cleared it up really well it's like a louis vuitton verse like a boat you're going to get off the side of the street like which one you're going to take care of more right like it's an investment in yourself and it's true like when i jumped on their first call with brienne uh with brit like he it wasn't like it wasn't the fact that he was he was young right it wasn't the fact that he's a young coder it was because like one of that guy one of those guys said that i was young so i got a course free that's not a dollar how it is yeah like it wasn't that guys it was a case of like he knew like when when he was speaking to me like he was like i can't afford the course but here's what i'm doing and he that was the energy that i felt and like i was like yo this is like we have to have this energy in the course because it showed that like he wasn't looking at it in terms of money he was looking in terms of like right i know i can't get into the course right now but but what can i do to better my situation so that like inside at some point i will be able to get in the course and if i don't god damn it i'm going to be a developer if somebody like somebody's not going to stop me right like it was like i would like to just cut you off for a minute for all those people who are actually like not in that situation who who can actually afford the course like it is actually expensive i wouldn't say that it doesn't but it's actually an investment on yourself and even if you can't i highly highly recommend you guys to watch their clones that they build in the amazon clone which you have on your youtube like they explain react context api like like anything and if you guys want to be in that my peace of mind state you guys should definitely check out this book deep book oh that's a great book by cal newport right fantastic book and talks yeah i was talking about brother about it just yesterday yeah it's it's so good and like when you like actually complete the complete reading the book even i'm doing it right now i'm reading it every day you guys actually tried to follow the rules and principles that kyle newport talks about it inside of you and try to be in that mind how did you get into personal development did your parents push you to get into personal development or did you pick it up on your own what it was actually kind of really funny like school is kind of easy for me because number one all the teachers [ __ ] and number two i have some friends who help me out oftentimes and my post so i got into personal development because see the ability of a person to just sit in his house and code all day and make a difference just by singer sitting at his house and not like being some kind of uh politician and making a difference that actually surprises me like the your ability to just sit in front of your computer and make a difference in hundreds of thousands of people's life is really surprising to me because you're putting in so much hard work and like this is so amazing like i had that ability that i never knew of in the two years back when i actually found out about coding i knew my potential of this laptop this crappy laptop that i have and i started to use it in the good way like oftentimes people tend to buy a laptop for the entertainment purposes right like some people buy for youtube some people wear it for netflix i even that was kind of like my performance and some people buy a chromebook oh my that thing guys yeah so that is something that's extremely good like they're that just mindset that you need to have like i'm learning something new like all the time that i've ever been like at any point of life i've always been in that learning attitude like i always want to learn more and more and more i have like tons and tons of encyclopedias i i used to study about theoretical physics and i was really engrossed in that too and i loved coding because i could build things that were really amazing and that could actually change the world and that would implement my life and as you guys asked me to do i started to document my journey i wrote i started to write blogs two days earlier and like you know how good it feels when you actually try to bring out value i want you to make i want you to make youtube content on coding or personal development or anything like that start off with like full on youtube can you make a video this week and post it up definitely i'm i'm working on on my exam i was working on yeah when would you upload your first video i'm planning to do it on wednesday because wednesday is actually my lucky day i've done several new things in wednesdays can you have it uploaded and published by thursday let's go dude no i'm actually planning to start creating the content and i'll brainstorm it tomorrow on monday i am teaching my friend so i'm gonna be occupied in that too and and another thing i would like to say is that guys some people say that like on sunny i talked to him about it yesterday and some people keep on complaining that they don't get clients they don't get students do it for free guys who's stopping you i teach my friends for free and that's how you get you get networking like you guys should watch the igtv video we did with i did but sunny like that is jam packed with value you you everyone should do it everyone should thank you so much for coming on always appreciate your energy when you drop that video send me a link to it on instagram okay i'll drive i'll drive people to watch it okay bye all right take care thank you thanks dude i had to kick him off otherwise he was going to take over this whole [ __ ] show dude if you guys love priyanka and his energy guys drop it in the comments below he's intended dude i feel like i have way too much power with this i know the whole deck is right here um okay we got a great comment by lem kennedy and he goes i'm a seasoned dev and i tutor daily so he's making an income from teaching other people coding which is i highly recommend you do that actually as one of the things he goes taking a break from finals to be here i've seen what the big boot camps are teaching the homework the projects and i can tell you that that's that there's more value here than what you learn at general assembly full sale etc at your own pace too the tas at the boot camps never have time to answer the questions students have no question goes unanswered here now what i like about lem is that he is hey another student just joined in profit with javascript welcome nice so lem started coding and profitable javascript and in his first three weeks he actually cleared fifteen hundred dollars in cash and he's only two months into coding he's a complete beginner to coding um and what is amazing about that about at least he's a beginner when it comes to i think react js right okay when you are teaching coding to other people you become better a lot faster and even if you're new to coding you can actually help people who are one step behind you because you're going to be a lot more relatable than somebody who has like 10 or 20 years of experience in coding yep and that's one of those things that's going to make just a strong foundation for you and give you that practical income coming in from coding so then you can actually quit your side hustle like if you're doing uber on the side or if you're doing construction work on the side you can stop that and actually spend eight to ten hours a day on coding so that's one tip that i would like to give all of you is figure out a way to make even one dollar from coding when you do that everything changes for you exactly guys and like the best way to do that is literally teach for free like my that's why i would advise you guys whoa dude so terry what insane dude go i think maybe uh can we bring that on the screen so teary just dropped a hundred dollar donation on youtube and he goes so terry can we bring you on here oh there we go nice and so tyra goes hey qazi and sunny graduated as a computer science major and used udemy throughout people really need to get the difference between profit with javascript college and other platforms i would love to join one day on the live with you guys and talk about the enormous values pwj brings love y'all dude we massively appreciate you like and and you're 100 like he's on the webinar oh dude let's bring him on 100 the spring we invited you so theory let me go ahead and stop the show that's crazy crazy dude damn thank you bro that made our freaking year that was awesome yeah really really awesome that's awesome um let me bring on awani i know some of you guys i'm sorry tommy some of the people have been waiting forever i apologize i forget sometimes hi amani how are you doing how's it going good good how are you guys doing fantastic so tell us just a little bit about you and like how before you got into coding you know like what were you doing the last few years i guess so uh guys i'm i'm actually a mom of toddler so i've been uh i used i have done my master's in computer science but that was like whole different like thesis level thing i got into coding few years back but it was like just just for few some years and then i had to drop it now it's like after four years i'm coming back again and it's just because i like coincidentally or fortunately saw this clever programming video in on youtube i was so furious that time i thought why did why did youtube took so much time to show me this video and i just started what was the video i the it was the five days challenge that amazon nice awesome yes i did that and then i immediately joined it so i want to tell want to tell people like like me especially i mean i know all the youngsters they love coding they want to learn so many things but the people who are looking for their career change who are absolutely beginners who are moms who actually like uh just want to do something but they don't have any idea what to do and they are thinking about coding this is the best place you can come to i mean there are lot of things like they have like so many like they have beginners also in term intermediate people also they are advanced level people so they all work together so you know you know what like how to solve your problems you you know you won't be you won't be overwhelmed at all you will be enjoying coding and people will be there to help you exactly wow yeah exactly that's why we try and push for is is more of a course it's more of a community right and it's going to be with you even once you get your job we actually have people who are actually in a fulltime position but they still come to those coaching calls they still come and actually come with their problems come with questions like hey sonny i'm in a new role and i don't know how to navigate this huge code base any tricks or tips you could share and those kind of things which pretty much it's not just me answering at that point is every single person inside the community um yeah yeah that's really awesome um so awhile i want to ask you uh if you if somebody is on the fence right now what would be your advice what would you what would you tell them if they were on the fence of joining pwj yes immediately join in i mean you're gonna enjoy it it's you not only gonna learn coding but also like how to communicate this is i mean i'm talking with you guys is one of one kind of a kind of achievement for me i would say i never been like live i have never uh i mean it's really really hard for me like i'm not confident enough to do that but i'm doing that that's one achievement from cleveland give her some words of encouragement in the comments below we have about 500 of people watching her live so guys just drop some love for awani and awan you're doing fantastic by the way like you're doing incredible yeah exactly you guys i mean credit goes to you all all cp community all the mentors all the coaches and even like all like my fellow friends like now they are becoming friends you know like i'm becoming like friends to so many people in the community so it's so great i mean and one more one more thing i want to uh mention see like uh i i'm learning how to question i mean how how we can why we should ask things so i have learned like i have learned that a lot of love coming in by the way like you are amazing daniel is like you're doing amazing thank you for sharing your experience everybody sharing jen yomna all sending heart signs for you thank you guys thank you so much means a lot yeah carry on the money yeah yeah i mean you learn how to question and i mean how to ask question actually because like lot of time you get struck in programming but you don't know how to ask people like how can i get the solution of it so when you go to the community you see like a lot of people are struggling from the same question and then you get the idea and like it will be helpful and it's just one week guys it's just one with me and i actually don't get that much time uh i mean i have a lot of things to like i really get very limited time to uh to code but that that time i actually am able to focus because the content is so good i mean it starts from beginning and then slowly take you take you there and there are like a lot of live calls where where people do fun nazis dancing i love that so i mean yeah i mean it's so much so good i mean i i really would tell all the people especially the ones who are thinking no this course is not for us like they are like just uh getting hesitated that like all the advanced people are there they know already know some coding how would we go there like how we will be doing everything right so i am the i am the example for them i i would say just come and you got really gonna enjoy it people are there to help you it's so good yeah exactly thank you so much i really appreciate you one thing i wanna em and this is something which i think kazi might be valuable to a lot of girls who are willing to join right so one thing i'll tell you guys from industry experience and the developer sort of market is very male dominant right it's very very male dominant at the moment there's a lot more guys who code than girls so one thing i can say is in our community we actually have some insanely talented like women inside of the course and it's really awesome to see that and i can actually say like a lot of our literally a lot of our best developers like jen um like iwanis is now in the course like we have so many amazing so powerful women inside of this course so if you're if you ever see like coding as sort of intimidating because you're you're a girl or or you maybe feel that like you might not fit in then this is something is in there melissa is in there amazing women exactly like and this is where like the support comes in we make it our best effort to make sure that everyone feels comfortable inside there which means in the coaching calls everything so everyone has like a completely like powerful voice inside the community so that's just something i want to highlight um yeah really really awesome to have you inside owani thank you so much appreciate you thank you thank you let's go hey me doing my job again cutting people off in the middle i wish i could just stop that um thank you for the 10 donation he goes you guys are amazing thank you for the course and all your free tutorials i appreciate you a lot thank you so much exactly um i'm going to try to guys we're going to try to go rapid fire and i'm going to just try to bring everybody on and if you guys join the course profit with javascript i'll try to bring you on as well and basically guys in the next 10 minutes if you join you can get on the call with sunny and me so right now it's 12 30 one pacific so nine more minutes left and at 12 40 the free coaching call that we're offering we're gonna end that just because we already had 20 students joined so far while we were live and we won't be able to we don't want to have 50 people on the coaching call when i have a limited number of people so we're going to rapid fire and go through people fast now so so yuri hi hey what's up so rapid fire you're 17 years old you're learning coding you're hyped you're excited tell us a little bit like why did you join profit with javascript and what would you say to somebody who's on the fence because today's the day the price goes up today is the day where we really just want to go hey if you want to get the best deal it's today a week from now the course doors close and after that we're going to shut the [ __ ] up and not talk about profit with javascript for a really long time yeah and there's going to be no enrollment for profit with javascript and we're just going to go crazy providing value on youtube and helping people and helping people in our program get results the ones who are in the program so if you're getting annoyed right now my apologies but it's just because we really believe that this is the best course on the planet so we want to give you that opportunity to get the best deal and after that nothing from us and we're just going to go back to our like daily

plus the value is never going to end unlike an udemy course okay so kazi my next question to you is what are we teaching in pwg you tell me sir yuri sonny what are we teaching what are we teaching

myself um and that's how you make the time important uh important um yeah otherwise and you were also doing a job right while you were going to pwj yes yes okay so give us a little bit of like because i know some people also want to hear results right they they like hearing people's stories they also want to hear results and i know you got some nice results so talk to me about like what happened with your job that you were initially going to with pwj and that you've shared with us because i think that's really awesome for people to hear i was working as a junior dev i was the junior member on the team uh and they had a budget shortfall from covid so i was the one that ended up getting cut from the team um how many people got hurt from the team uh i think about 25 well from the whole company about 25 to 30 people all got played off on the same day um yeah so between um the uh so using profit javascript stuff i had redone my recently redone my portfolio and my resume sorry you just always keep that there just just in case and um reaching out to the network of people that i have made through um instagram twitter um flat groups that i'm in um just put out there that hey guys i need a job um and so put out a blast of i can't i don't know for sure i would say about 40 or 50 applications um had an interview this was a monday how to interview tuesday an interview wednesday and a job offer on thursday damn that's insane and what were the what were the results like so you went from what was the job that you had and if you're not comfortable sharing the numbers that's okay but if you want to share the numbers you're more than welcome to because i think it gives people context yeah but what were the results you lost the job while you were in the course and then you got another job and what was the difference i was a junior dev making just about 50 000 i'm just under um i am now a senior dev um because of all of the react and advanced javascript stuff that i've been working on with clever programmer made my portfolio kind of bump me up to the next level i am i have a salary of 95 000 with plus benefits and bonus options so i will be bumped up over you know a hundred thousand a year by the time everything rolls out awesome that makes me so happy jen i'm so happy for you that is so amazing and i can like i don't have to do like i was doing side projects on the side and i i don't have to do what was your what was your reaction when you got that email from them it was like an email right where they gave you the offer yeah it was it was actually during a coaching call one of nasa's coaching calls and i was just like i thought i thought they were joking that the amount that they had an offer letter i was like they can't be serious yeah it's like one of those it sounds like one of those scam emails they're like just wire us 30k here first that is amazing thank you so much for coming on jen appreciate you guys give it up for dan what an amazing result going from 50 as a junior developer to 96k as a senior developer thank you for coming on exactly i appreciate you bye all right guys we had a few people joining so we had tyson we had sweater we had john kenwright george garcia jorge garcia yeah welcome guys yep awesome that's awesome you guys jumped on into profit with javascript and guys so the coaching call the time is now up so the coaching

rapid fire frank you got 30 seconds hey what's up frank what's going on guys um just want to let you know there's a huge difference between all these courses that you guys are seeing and the clever programming courses i like to like think about it as fast food mcdonald's udemy stuff and like custom sushi chef like 800 beverly hills sushi exactly exactly you know the place too right i know yeah um guys again like i was able to take that that course um i was able to do that spotify clone with sunny and the guys from sonos like like hired me man i'm i'm making almost 15k a month now like that's a huge amount of money guys it's like we're not playing around and i get that job you guys take over cp you got it frank if there's a position open at sonos let me know yeah what the hell man and what was how much were you making before that job by the way um i was i i was just doing freelance stuff it was just like janky like little stuff here and there on average how much were you making a year um i was like at 130 you know like average and you know they take like average yeah like net 90 you know i didn't get paid for three months at a time awful yeah you know so this helped me put me over the edge and love you guys and it's the community is well worth it guys you you're gonna get you're gonna level up because of that i mean but you so frank has went up from 130k to 170k which is awesome but frank what the hell man i think you've paid the difference a 40 000 difference in donations to us so you're not making any extra money i'm going to keep doing it so that maybe thank you so much for coming out we're going to keep bringing people a lot guy frank what would you say to them if should they join should they not join should they think about it take some more time what do you think no join get off the fence man it's uh it's better on the other side believe me uh you'll get a lot of opportunities that you didn't have before let's get it man just come join me come join everyone it's a family let's go somebody join from your words commodity yeah kamala just joined thank you frank really appreciate you brother have a good one love you guys peace yo wayne what is going on my man hi man are you doing dude that's that i want to set it up bro wow are you making content or what uh yeah i do he just did live streaming he was in the coaching call yesterday so oh nice awesome dude talk to me wayne what are you doing with that mic and that setup are you making youtube content i am yes um the kids started me into it um mainly i wasn't comfortable talking in front of the camera so this was for me to get over my fear by doing that right now so this is how i'm able to talk to you a lot more confident dope that is freaking exciting there's something beautiful about starting to put out content and speak your confidence level goes up so fast it's weird you're like wait i haven't had this boost in my whole life and all of a sudden in like two weeks you see a big difference we saw a big difference in even some of the people from our community like amanath and he's like now so confident when he speaks so something interesting nasa just told me what did you do to your team treehouse subscription and then i think you also joined profit javascript so talk to me about that i did um basically i messaged you in i think as one of your videos that i was actually on the fence uh so i've gone through team treehouse i did the udemy uh did coursera i did everything basically and one of the main things that pushed me over yesterday was the strength of your community and because i'm looking through my team treehouse and i'm there to finish to full stack uh javascript developer was 36 hours so i looked to that and i went yeah okay i can do 36 hours but three months later it's i'm only on 26 and the problem is is that is that there's no human interaction you're left alone and also you're told to reach out to people via linkedin and you do that and no one gets back to you anyway so i signed off i went over to the fence crossed over and this morning it's been a whirlwind uh you i'm going to the facebook group i've actually gone to your slack and everyone's commented and not left me alone since this morning basically got me into everything that's awesome dude and how did you find the coaching call uh perfect you know it's you know it's it's one of those ones that you don't really expect to be happening and so you know i was i was on the fence thinking is this just another course it's just going to be going through just acceptable money but it's not the case as soon as the payment has gone through and if you start coming through uh satisfaction from there awesome and what would you say to someone who's on the fence of joining like what was it that actually pushed you over the fence and and then some people might be able to relate to that yeah so yesterday's obviously the community strength in that uh so after like yesterday uh because i meant to comment onto your your channel as soon as i signed up i canceled my subscription to team treehouse and so from there that saved me an extra two hundred pound a month that's awesome dude nice damn steep yeah hey listen subscription yeah that is awesome man we're very glad to have you in the community are you gonna make are you ever interested in making coding content yeah definitely um a little bit of background about myself is that i've i was at the very beginning of the birth of the internet and everything from there and also was building html tables the web is built in tables uh i was there when bootstrap came in and foundation first came in so then obviously i changed my career down to uh ux design so and when furlough oh sorry when kevin came in i was furloughed a few months so within that three months i think how can i uh bump up my salary i know can i be more um how can i help the team out a lot more so that's when i started looking into javascript and it's just after i just kind of grind can mature and after that but no so after today uh it's been a war event so guys i'm so glad to be on your course and if you are on the fence just leap you're never gonna know until you jumped yep all right thank you wayne so much man really appreciate you brother have a good one yeah cheers guys thank you love the sound dude yep yo lamb how's it going how you doing brother talk to us about some results what has happened since you've joined pwj oh man it's been pretty crazy like um i actually i actually went down the uh the tutoring route um and uh it's it's crazy like i i deal with uh with boot camp students all the time and uh i you know you read this out in the comments like you know the stuff that they the stuff that they uh they teach like i see better things coming out of out of pwj and out of your courses and like the stuff that you have planned um and like my big things i know this is going quick my big thing is that if you're a seasoned developer and you're watching this because i'm a i'm a seasoned vet too i've been coding for like over 20 years now um of course this these uh the clever programmer like you know they've got their their finger on the pulse of what is like popular right now like what's actually gonna what you can put in your book and like on your site and like what uh what what everybody's looking for especially if you're like me and like you know you got displaced by um kovin so you know if you're on the fence don't be i mean it's worth it it's worth it at all skill levels that's awesome you actually joined quite recently as well right yeah yeah i've only i um i found a video on uh when i when i first um um lost my gig i found a video on uh uh quasi uh uh talking about um tutoring on wise it like you guys your free content um actually is what uh what tick started me and what video was it specifically that helped you by the way i think it was the um how to make uh five grand as a javascript developer or something like that i don't remember the name of it um directly i'll i'll i'll let you know but um but yeah it was like i was like okay i'll try it and i made i made enough to join the course within a few days and i was like well you know if uh if the free content was was enough to uh to do that i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna come in and i'm gonna i'm going to actually see what what this is all about and i'm so glad i have like the community is great and how much did you make in the first three weeks of the program uh i think at that point i was somewhere at about 1500. not bad yeah investment yeah it's still still going up tyson says digging the nintendo with the old duck hunt gun in the background that's right that's right you gotta show off your cred i remember when i was really young when i was a baby i used to be like really fat and like i would have a diaper on i'd be running around everywhere in the house and i remember my brothers would always go behind the tv and plugins do something with the wires and then you'd be able to play that game where you can like do duck hunt and i didn't know what they did because i was like two years old right i was like so young like one or two years old so i just thought they would go behind the tv and like i so they weren't at home i went behind the tv and i just tried to model what they did so i just took the wires just like randomly like dangled them and came back to the front and i'm like why the hell is this not working why can't i play my duck hunt game i got so angry my brothers walked in on me and i just had like i was just wearing my like diaper i had the tv and i was like i broke the freaking like pushed it off and it like ellen broke i was so angry yeah so that's my story with that duck hunt game that's what i do and my code doesn't compile you know yeah right right after after hour 10 of debugging exactly damn but he's still wearing a diaper right thank you so much for coming on no problem [Laughter] i was going to make an internal joke but i realized yeah rage quit um awesome all right so this has been pretty freaking epic i think we have a few more people to bring on and i think we're going to take on one more person guys and then after this we're hey what's up bro dude you really gotta like do the conor mcgregor thing one day bro just like that yeah yeah i'll growled the beard i'll work on the irish accent like a fight club every time patch comes on he's like ready to go you know dude the wife the wife beater has been the one consistency in my life since my bars closed back in march it's just been like every day i'm like i don't have to leave the house i can do everything from home i'm just going to throw on the cozy shirt you know that's it yeah yes yeah so i think some of the people have heard your story but i think that is really inspiring for people and can just give us a little bit of like what you were doing with previously yeah and yeah uh yeah so i was i've been a bartender i've been living in la for about 11 years and and i've been making my living as a bartender for like the last 11 years and it just like these last couple years i just find myself no matter what job i'm at no matter how much money i'm making when i know i have to go there i'm like [ __ ] this when's it going to be over i don't want to spend eight hours doing this get home at 3am my whole next day's ruined like the whole thing and i was like you know then you mix alcohol with you know some entitled people that come in and you're just like it's just a recipe for an argument or someone's ego for you know it's just like it's not a positive environment more often than not and i was like i don't want to spend my time there but and so on the other side of that i'm also an actor and a writer were you so were you skilled at that stuff could you do like the crazy tricks that they do the bartenders do the best the best trick i ever learned how to do was to blow fire so i like i could take uh i could take a empty bottle of gray goose and roll up roll the napkin up to look kind of like a little flower you dip it in bacardi 151 you light it on fire you take a swig of the bacardi and you just kind of like spit and pull away and like you get this big old fireball so that was kind of fun nice dude yeah yeah yeah no i was good though you know i i knew i could do that at the bar what's that you would do that at the bar only one bar i've ever worked at let us do it there and that's just because they were like we were downtown it was a dive bar and so it was cool but um but yeah multipliers weren't like that's people literally getting lit dude coming out of there they're like yo this [ __ ] is on fire no no it's on fire it was on fire it was cool man uh it was fun but you know aside from like little things like that and stuff like it was just a negative environment and so i like you know i started ever since lockdown had been spending a lot of time like on acting and writing and stuff like that and then i was like well i obviously need to think about when my bar opens up i don't want to go back like i want to be done with that part of my life what else can i do and then you know i just kind of like huh i was just going to add no skill goes every skill can be useful like imagine if you're making a training video and you're like guys today we're going to be learning about firebase totally yeah yeah and you should apply to a job like that you'll be like guys this app that i built for you guys is built with react and firebase can breathe out and let's go bacardi 151 the camera yeah man yeah totally no i mean there's definitely like some skills that i learned as a bartender you know you know learning the gift of gab and socializing and just like i always loved the aspect i got to meet people from all over and you know different people from all around the world and stuff like that that was really cool but um yeah man so so i was uh doing a lot of acting and writing i was like what else can i do i don't want to go back to the bar so i was like well let's take a look at coding and obviously you know like i knew of you quasi through amber lee because she used to train me in boxing i can't wait to get back to that by the way um and so i was so i hit her up and i was like you know is is causie what's the deal i know he's a programmer and stuff and so she told me a little bit about it and i watched you guys videos on youtube and and uh my girlfriend's friend is a programmer as well and like graphic design and stuff like that and so basically i was like what else can i do that's creative that makes decent money but more than anything else i will enjoy so i was like let's give this a shot and i just kind of dove into it and i was like well this is a lot of fun and you know i kind of found myself like going down the rabbit hole for like five hours a day just like messing around making cool little web pages and stuff like that and um you know making little websites for friends and all that kind of stuff and i was like this is [ __ ] great and i don't have to leave the house if i don't want to i don't have to worry about it's pandemic proof you know what i mean yeah and at the end of the day it scratches my you know creative itch so that's why i felt like it was a good fit for me so you know damn that's awesome dude that's awesome bro thanks i really appreciate that we appreciate that story and like how you went from like even you getting interested into coding it's like you kind of just heard it from a friend like your girlfriend's friend right and you were like hey this guy's a graphic designer and doing coding and that got you interested in it and i remember you and i were on a call yeah yeah man i was just like spilling my guts to you and and i was like dude i don't know if it's the right thing for me i already have so much going on i want to be able to find my balance and you're like dude just do it i was like [ __ ] it i'm gonna do it yeah you know i have not got it and so today the price of the program permanently goes up if somebody's thinking about it would you recommend this program to them and i know now you have some experience with the program too because you've been in it yeah yeah i think so definitely like if it's if you want to if you want a program and you want to learn how to do it right then join profit with javascript because not only do you get the classes but like uh wayne said earlier like it's you're joined for the community as well like that's almost more valuable than the class because you don't have a lot of classes where you can get answers if you have a question and like i think that is one of the obviously coding is difficult and you're gonna get confused at times and who do you reach out to if you have a question like this community is has been so incredibly helpful for me so like i love all you guys man it's it's you've made you've made the process of learning something brand new like this a lot of fun so there we are i love that yeah thank you so much brother thank you so much you got it guys love you guys see ya appreciate you bye damn all right guys so i think that's it for for today i hope that you guys enjoyed it got value out of it um is there anything else sunny you think we should talk about or or do you want to end it off with i think the main thing is guys like you saw today like not from like a fancy presentation not from something you know like premade it's pretty much real people speaking to you guys that like this course is more than just a course right it's a community it's something which is growing it's it's dynamic it's constantly evolving it's growing it keeps up to date as well with the latest and and newest trends you know like everything is always adapting in web development so we not just us but the community is ahead of trend right so like we're always getting sort of your news feed and things like that now what i want to say is if you haven't or if you're on the fence my personal advice to you guys is regardless if you get it today or if you get like within a few days the point is that doors will close to that community in a week's time so on the 26th we pretty much close the doors and once they're closed we don't know when they're going to open again um so it's very much a case of like if you're on the fence my advice is jump right now i remember 30 day money back guarantee so my advice would be go ahead jump in see what it's like because at least that way you give yourself the option of trying the course otherwise if it closes by the 26th you miss the chance to even test it out right so what's the what's what's better right 30 days of testing something and then if you don't like you can get your money back or just like missing out on the opportunity and then letting it go forever right that's my take on it um but as you can tell guys we're never gonna stop bringing that free value for you guys on youtube so the fire is gonna keep coming and with that said i mean i'm pretty good dude i think i think anything you want to add to that that's it i think you guys have heard enough we really appreciate you we love you today is the last day of the price and then after that week from now doors closed we love you guys we appreciate you this is qazi this is sunny and we will see you in the next video click that button below flick it jump in the course you won't regret it we promise you
