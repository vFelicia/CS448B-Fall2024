00:02 - hey guys what's up this is kazy from
00:03 - clever program.com and today I want to
00:06 - talk to you guys
00:07 - about uh soft
00:10 - skills and why you might need
00:14 - them now I know that a lot of people
00:17 - want to just focus on one thing and get
00:20 - really good at it I mean don't get me
00:23 - wrong I was I have been pretty much my
00:25 - whole life been that way you know I
00:27 - started in chess um and went crazy in
00:32 - chess played for a long time and now I'm
00:35 - in the top 1% in the world um
00:39 - but you know so I got really technical
00:42 - into it and then same thing with
00:45 - computer programming once I discovered
00:48 - programming I just started going crazy
00:50 - into it like I would be up 6:00 a.m.
00:52 - 7:00 a.m. every single
00:54 - day um and get very little sleep and
00:58 - just focus on learning it and getting
01:00 - better ated and acquiring better
01:02 - skills
01:03 - but one of the things that has benefited
01:07 - me the most so
01:09 - far has been developing soft
01:14 - skills and the reason why I say this is
01:19 - because like personally I'm a college
01:22 - student but I have gotten jobs and I
01:26 - have worked with clients where I have
01:28 - charged way more
01:30 - and I mean way more than some experts
01:35 - who have been working in the field for
01:36 - 30 years and literally know a billion
01:39 - times more than I
01:42 - do so the point is you know I'm not
01:46 - saying this so I'm trying to like brag
01:48 - or anything but what I'm trying to tell
01:50 - you guys is don't just focus on
01:54 - improving your skill in whatever field
01:56 - it is that you're working
01:58 - in also Focus on improving your skill
02:01 - set you know on
02:03 - negotiation people skills you know make
02:06 - sure people like you because one of the
02:10 - top reasons why people get promoted or
02:13 - the top like the easiest ways to get
02:14 - promoted and stuff is for people to like
02:17 - you because when they're having a
02:19 - meeting a lot of the times people are
02:20 - not sitting there and being like you
02:22 - know I think we should promote John or
02:24 - we should promote Charlene because she's
02:26 - this you know she's so skilled uh
02:29 - sometimes when people are sitting
02:30 - emotions are involved so they'll just be
02:32 - like you know I really like Charlene and
02:34 - she's good at her job or I really like
02:38 - John and he's really good at at his job
02:41 - so it really stems from people liking
02:43 - you and that'll put you in better places
02:47 - now negotiation right just the first
02:49 - thing that I
02:51 - mentioned it's something that in the
02:55 - United States especially people almost
02:57 - look down upon like no nobody works on
03:01 - their negotiation skills like and I felt
03:05 - like this as well I almost felt like
03:07 - negotiation was kind of like equivalent
03:09 - to haggling in a
03:11 - supermarket um but that's really not
03:14 - true negotiation is a key skill to
03:18 - develop in your in your life and use it
03:21 - to your advantage um because think about
03:25 - it in the interview that you're having
03:27 - at a job that you're going to be working
03:29 - on for potential the next 5 years 1 year
03:31 - 10 years however
03:35 - long if you negotiate
03:38 - incorrectly the money that you would
03:40 - have made in the first year you're now
03:42 - going to make in 5 years so you just
03:46 - added on four more
03:49 - years because you couldn't use those 15
03:53 - minutes that you got to sit down for an
03:54 - interview
03:58 - wisely so
04:00 - even if you're just starting out in
04:01 - computer
04:02 - programming Great learn skills but
04:05 - before you get that first job please
04:08 - make sure you work on your soft skills
04:10 - and improve them that'll help you with
04:13 - your negotiation it'll help you with
04:16 - people at the job liking you which will
04:18 - help you with promotions and more than
04:21 - that it'll help you with potentially
04:24 - being able to get into upper
04:25 - management okay nobody wants a leader
04:28 - that they don't like
04:30 - I know plenty of really good
04:34 - programmers really skilled at what they
04:36 - do and this is again not just relating
04:38 - to programming I mean computer
04:40 - networking um you know people who are in
04:43 - uh in any political field whatever it
04:46 - may be that you're in right if you just
04:50 - focus on getting good at it there's
04:52 - plenty of people that are really skilled
04:53 - at what they do but they don't make
04:57 - enough
04:58 - money right and that's the end of the
05:00 - day no matter how satisfying our job is
05:03 - we are doing it to make money and money
05:06 - allows us to spend more times with our
05:08 - family spend more time with our friends
05:10 - because realistically I mean let's be
05:11 - real if you already had all the money
05:15 - that you needed you wouldn't be doing a
05:16 - job no matter how much you love it right
05:20 - [Music]
05:21 - um I mean you might still do something
05:23 - that you love but you probably wouldn't
05:25 - be doing a job you might run your own
05:26 - business right so at the end of the
05:29 - today we are doing a job for money in
05:33 - return right so don't you want to get
05:36 - good at that right don't you want to get
05:39 - more skilled at those
05:41 - things so really focus on improving
05:44 - those and please take the time out do
05:46 - yourself a favor take the time out to
05:48 - learn about negotiation skills improve
05:51 - them okay I'll put some links for you
05:54 - guys below these blog posts are not
05:56 - written by me but I've read these and
05:58 - these have helped me tremendously you
