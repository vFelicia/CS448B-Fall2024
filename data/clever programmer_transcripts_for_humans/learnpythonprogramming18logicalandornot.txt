00:00 - guys what's up this is konzi from clever
00:01 - programmer calm in this video we are
00:04 - going to talk about boolean logical
00:07 - operators so in the last video we
00:09 - covered the basic jujitsu of boolean
00:13 - algebra kind of like what is the basic
00:17 - most fundamental ideas behind boolean
00:20 - algebra and we saw that everything that
00:22 - we talked about conversely their true or
00:24 - false right so here we have all these
00:28 - things converting to true or false
00:30 - that's effectively what ends up
00:32 - happening at the end so now let's go and
00:37 - talk about the operators that I was
00:40 - mentioning ok so before I start giving
00:43 - you their rules and how they are defined
00:46 - in the world of electricity or logic
00:49 - gates or programming for that matter I
00:52 - want to just give you guys an intuitive
00:54 - sense of how it works because that's way
00:57 - more important than memorizing these you
01:00 - know truth tables for a lot of these
01:02 - cases so ATLA so let me get try to give
01:06 - you guys an intuition so let's start off
01:09 - with and okay we're going to start off
01:13 - with this logical operator as you can
01:16 - see it's a special word in Python which
01:19 - is why it highlights to orange if you
01:21 - write and with 2ds it does not highlight
01:23 - to orange and let's talk about what it
01:26 - does so let's say I did um you know 5 &
01:31 - 5 it'll give me back a 5 and here it's
01:35 - not really making sense
01:36 - let's try true and true and let's see
01:42 - what it returns it returned true now
01:43 - let's try something like true and false
01:45 - let's see what that returns that returns
01:48 - false so now let me try to give you guys
01:50 - an intuition of how it works for and
01:54 - let's say there are there two things I
01:57 - asked you do you like poison and do you
02:00 - like pizza right umm if I asked you that
02:05 - question and you could only answer with
02:07 - yes or no what would you say
02:12 - hopefully you would say false or no
02:15 - right and then I would be and if I asked
02:20 - you to elaborate then you might say I
02:21 - might like pizza but I really don't like
02:24 - poison right so the idea behind you not
02:29 - liking poison but you liking pizza that
02:33 - whole thing when you combine it with an
02:35 - end that whole thing becomes false
02:37 - because there's one of those things that
02:40 - you don't like so you you can't say yes
02:44 - to the whole expression that I gave you
02:47 - right for and both of the things have to
02:51 - be true for you to say yes to it like if
02:54 - I asked you do like pizza and ice cream
02:55 - you say yeah right but if I tell you
02:59 - like jumping off of the cliff or do you
03:01 - like jump or do you like doing your math
03:03 - homework a lot and you like writing
03:05 - essays in that case probably both of the
03:08 - things you might not like doing your
03:10 - math homework and writing essays and you
03:13 - might say no I like doing neither of
03:15 - them or for sure you would say false
03:18 - right so I can say something like math
03:21 - homework let's set it to false meaning
03:26 - like you don't like it and let's say
03:29 - long essays is equal to false and now
03:34 - let's combine the two let's say math
03:36 - homework and long essays you get back
03:41 - false right math homework is really
03:46 - false and long essays or false so false
03:48 - and false gives you a false now let's
03:51 - try pizza and let's say we like it for
03:54 - my friend Danielle he loves pizza so if
03:56 - you're watching this video that's who I
03:59 - was thinking of when I came up with this
04:00 - example let's do ice cream and let's set
04:03 - that to true meaning we like both of
04:05 - them and let's do pizza and ice cream
04:08 - right and you get back true so even
04:12 - thinking about it logically
04:13 - whenever you combine something with an
04:16 - end both of those things are now
04:17 - combined so when you're answering you're
04:19 - answering for both of them even in real
04:21 - life both of those things have to be
04:23 - true John
04:25 - go throw out your garbage and then you
04:28 - get to play right
04:30 - so in that case both of those things
04:34 - happen to be true if you throw out the
04:39 - garbage you know then you kind of get to
04:41 - play it's a little bit of a contrived
04:42 - example there's more of an if-then
04:44 - statement rather than an end okay how
04:48 - about this even better
04:50 - Johnny throw out your garbage and do
04:52 - your homework and then you get to play
04:54 - okay in that case the only way Johnny
04:57 - will get to play his game is if he has
05:00 - thrown out the garbage and done his
05:02 - homework much better now I can now I can
05:06 - sleep better all right that's the
05:09 - breakdown for end so now let me just
05:12 - give you some problems and throw it at
05:14 - your face okay false and false quickly
05:17 - what do you think is going to be you
05:19 - should have said false false and true
05:23 - remember one of them is false both of
05:25 - them end up being false because we can
05:29 - imagine that this is poison and then
05:31 - this is pizza and you can't say true to
05:34 - both of them because there's one of them
05:36 - that you don't like for it to be true
05:39 - both of them have to be true what if I
05:42 - gave you true and false what if I gave
05:45 - you true and true what do you think that
05:47 - would be okay hopefully you're trying to
05:49 - get a little you're starting to get a
05:51 - little bit of sense of this why this
05:53 - will be important later on is once we
05:55 - get to the conditionals of control flow
05:56 - section which we should be getting to in
05:58 - the next video and there we're going to
06:01 - be talking about how you can combine an
06:03 - if statement use an end to check two
06:06 - conditions and then the block of code
06:08 - runs so if Johnny homework and pizza or
06:15 - and I don't know throw out garbage then
06:23 - this code here runs okay obviously I'm
06:29 - going to hit syntax errors right now
06:30 - because I haven't defined Johnny
06:31 - homework I haven't defined throw out
06:33 - garbage and you can't write stuff
06:35 - separated by spaces and I don't know who
06:37 - rights capital variables only if it's
06:41 - constants but we'll get to that later
06:42 - all right so now let's go to the or side
06:48 - of things what if we combine two things
06:49 - with an or if I asked you do you like
06:53 - pizza okay for sanity check assume you
06:58 - like pizza even if you don't okay so
07:01 - just to play along just imagine you like
07:03 - pizza so if I ask you do you like pizza
07:06 - or doing homework if you had to answer
07:12 - that with the true or false what would
07:14 - you say if you like pizza or doing math
07:18 - homework if you could only enter the
07:20 - true or false or yes or no you should
07:23 - say yes or you should say true because
07:27 - there's one of those things that you
07:29 - like and I asked you or they're not
07:31 - connected with each other right A or B
07:34 - so let's now get and let me show you
07:38 - guys this in code if I do false or true
07:40 - check out what you get back you get back
07:42 - a true statement right if I do true or
07:47 - false I get back a true statement and if
07:51 - I replace this with something that we
07:53 - understand better let's say we don't
07:55 - like poison poison is equal to false and
07:58 - let's say we do like pizza and we
08:02 - already have pizzas true but I'm just
08:04 - going to do that it can and now let's
08:06 - write this statement over here using
08:09 - pizza and poison sorry
08:14 - pizza or poison OH
08:19 - I misspelled poison but in one of my
08:23 - older videos I had it there so don't
08:25 - worry about why it figured out what
08:27 - poison was but um
08:29 - yeah let's just let's just use this
08:32 - poison variable that we wrote here so
08:34 - you can see that we get back a statement
08:36 - that's true because one of the things is
08:39 - true and in this case that's pizza so
08:42 - for an or statement to be true only one
08:44 - of the things have to be true right if I
08:46 - asked you do you like ice cream and
08:51 - or pizza you would say true if you could
08:54 - only answer that with one thing just
08:57 - like if you know again we take Johnny or
09:02 - our son Bob and we go Bob either if you
09:08 - do your homework
09:09 - or you throw out the garbage then you
09:11 - get to play so he just goes oh sweet I'm
09:14 - just gonna throw out the garbage so this
09:16 - way he doesn't have to worry about doing
09:18 - homework he decides to only do one of
09:20 - the tasks and then he can play the game
09:22 - but what if he went and tried to be
09:25 - extra nice and threw out the garbage and
09:27 - then when it did his homework but he
09:30 - still would you know us being his dad or
09:34 - mom still allow him to play of course he
09:37 - did both of the things great that's
09:38 - extra bonus but for him to qualify as a
09:42 - player or like go play his games
09:45 - he really needs only one thing that's
09:47 - what the order does in our real life and
09:49 - so that's what it does in programming as
09:53 - well so now let's just let me just throw
09:56 - some examples at your face and you try
09:58 - to figure it out
09:59 - true or false what do you think I'm
10:01 - going to get quickly I'm going to get
10:03 - back a true only one out one of them has
10:05 - to be true what if I did true or true
10:06 - what am I going to get back true
10:09 - obviously what if I do true or or sorry
10:13 - let's do false or false - false
10:16 - statements you like poison or homework
10:21 - you're gonna say no you know none of
10:27 - them there you go so that's a little bit
10:31 - of a breakdown of or and if I wanted to
10:34 - break down not for you not is very
10:36 - simple not is just something that
10:40 - doesn't happen okay so it's it's just
10:43 - the negation of something so if I said
10:45 - not true what do you think I'd get back
10:46 - I get back false if I did not false what
10:50 - would I get back true it's just a
10:53 - negation so if I do something like not
10:55 - true or false what do you think I'm
10:59 - going to get back what is this
11:01 - expression going to evaluate to true
11:04 - or Falls remember for something to be
11:07 - true in the or but combined with the
11:09 - oral boolean logical operator only one
11:12 - of the statements has to be true so here
11:14 - we do have a true so true or false
11:16 - evaluates to a true and then right this
11:20 - pretty much becomes true and then
11:22 - calling not untrue gives us false so now
11:26 - let's just run it okay and as you can
11:29 - see we get back false so what I'm going
11:32 - to do for you guys on clever programmer
11:34 - comm is if you guys go to submit your
11:37 - exercises here what I'm going to do is
11:40 - I'll have or sorry if you go to do the
11:42 - watch the video course on my website I
11:44 - will have exercises here for you where
11:47 - you can kind of drill and kill how true
11:49 - and false and the stuff boolean
11:51 - operators work that's going to be very
11:53 - very useful for you guys so then when
11:57 - you're writing your if-then statements
11:59 - you'll understand what you're doing okay
12:02 - but this is kind of you know we just
12:04 - need a basic understanding of it some
12:07 - places go really crazy in depth into it
12:10 - like creating things like not true or
12:12 - false or true you know just just
12:18 - combining it and making it into it like
12:23 - these can be good exercises for you to
12:25 - figure out but realistically when you're
12:27 - writing code you're not going to be
12:28 - doing stuff like this so if you can
12:30 - figure this out in your head great but
12:33 - um you know like you're not writing code
12:36 - like this most of the time so I wouldn't
12:38 - want to worry about it too much but if
12:40 - you want to go ahead and give yourself
12:41 - some crazy exercises like this to do or
12:44 - come to my website where I'll have some
12:46 - exercises for you guys to do that would
12:47 - be great and before I conclude this
12:51 - video let's go back to here I have put
12:55 - together a truth table for you guys or
12:59 - rather it's on Wikimedia @ org so I
13:04 - didn't put this together but I have an
13:06 - image I'll link you guys the image and
13:07 - you can see how the truth tables work so
13:12 - in the a column we have some statement
13:15 - imagine it being P
13:17 - it's a-- right we have that statement
13:20 - and be say some other statement so we
13:23 - don't really know what these statements
13:25 - are for now but you can imagine them to
13:27 - be whatever you want so let's say we
13:29 - have some statement and some statement B
13:31 - if a is false and B is false then a and
13:35 - B you get back false right remember and
13:40 - so if you have again a being poison and
13:45 - B being homework poison and homework you
13:50 - get back false you like neither of them
13:52 - and if we have a or B since both of them
13:55 - are false it's still false and not a is
13:58 - just the opposite of that you get back
14:02 - true and same thing over here we have
14:06 - false and true false and true gives you
14:10 - back a false false and true you only
14:14 - need one thing to be true in or
14:15 - statements you get back a true and then
14:17 - not a which is saying you know opposite
14:21 - of a since a was false you get back a
14:24 - true ok so one thing I need you want you
14:28 - to notice about and operator and or
14:32 - operators if you look down the column of
14:34 - the end operator you'll only see one
14:36 - true case and the reason and the only
14:40 - reason why it's true is because both of
14:43 - the statements are true okay that's the
14:46 - key thing to remember both of the things
14:49 - are true and if you go and look in the
14:50 - or column you'll see the or being false
14:55 - only in one case and the only case is
14:57 - false is when both of the things are
14:58 - false okay so notice the key distinction
15:01 - between the two okay
15:04 - that's kind of all you have to know for
15:06 - a boolean stuff and I'm not going to go
15:08 - into the next video with the really long
15:10 - nested boolean statements it's kind of
15:12 - useless we don't really think that way
15:14 - anyways and we're gonna get into
15:18 - conditionals and control flow so I will
15:20 - see you guys there

Cleaned transcript:

guys what's up this is konzi from clever programmer calm in this video we are going to talk about boolean logical operators so in the last video we covered the basic jujitsu of boolean algebra kind of like what is the basic most fundamental ideas behind boolean algebra and we saw that everything that we talked about conversely their true or false right so here we have all these things converting to true or false that's effectively what ends up happening at the end so now let's go and talk about the operators that I was mentioning ok so before I start giving you their rules and how they are defined in the world of electricity or logic gates or programming for that matter I want to just give you guys an intuitive sense of how it works because that's way more important than memorizing these you know truth tables for a lot of these cases so ATLA so let me get try to give you guys an intuition so let's start off with and okay we're going to start off with this logical operator as you can see it's a special word in Python which is why it highlights to orange if you write and with 2ds it does not highlight to orange and let's talk about what it does so let's say I did um you know 5 & 5 it'll give me back a 5 and here it's not really making sense let's try true and true and let's see what it returns it returned true now let's try something like true and false let's see what that returns that returns false so now let me try to give you guys an intuition of how it works for and let's say there are there two things I asked you do you like poison and do you like pizza right umm if I asked you that question and you could only answer with yes or no what would you say hopefully you would say false or no right and then I would be and if I asked you to elaborate then you might say I might like pizza but I really don't like poison right so the idea behind you not liking poison but you liking pizza that whole thing when you combine it with an end that whole thing becomes false because there's one of those things that you don't like so you you can't say yes to the whole expression that I gave you right for and both of the things have to be true for you to say yes to it like if I asked you do like pizza and ice cream you say yeah right but if I tell you like jumping off of the cliff or do you like jump or do you like doing your math homework a lot and you like writing essays in that case probably both of the things you might not like doing your math homework and writing essays and you might say no I like doing neither of them or for sure you would say false right so I can say something like math homework let's set it to false meaning like you don't like it and let's say long essays is equal to false and now let's combine the two let's say math homework and long essays you get back false right math homework is really false and long essays or false so false and false gives you a false now let's try pizza and let's say we like it for my friend Danielle he loves pizza so if you're watching this video that's who I was thinking of when I came up with this example let's do ice cream and let's set that to true meaning we like both of them and let's do pizza and ice cream right and you get back true so even thinking about it logically whenever you combine something with an end both of those things are now combined so when you're answering you're answering for both of them even in real life both of those things have to be true John go throw out your garbage and then you get to play right so in that case both of those things happen to be true if you throw out the garbage you know then you kind of get to play it's a little bit of a contrived example there's more of an ifthen statement rather than an end okay how about this even better Johnny throw out your garbage and do your homework and then you get to play okay in that case the only way Johnny will get to play his game is if he has thrown out the garbage and done his homework much better now I can now I can sleep better all right that's the breakdown for end so now let me just give you some problems and throw it at your face okay false and false quickly what do you think is going to be you should have said false false and true remember one of them is false both of them end up being false because we can imagine that this is poison and then this is pizza and you can't say true to both of them because there's one of them that you don't like for it to be true both of them have to be true what if I gave you true and false what if I gave you true and true what do you think that would be okay hopefully you're trying to get a little you're starting to get a little bit of sense of this why this will be important later on is once we get to the conditionals of control flow section which we should be getting to in the next video and there we're going to be talking about how you can combine an if statement use an end to check two conditions and then the block of code runs so if Johnny homework and pizza or and I don't know throw out garbage then this code here runs okay obviously I'm going to hit syntax errors right now because I haven't defined Johnny homework I haven't defined throw out garbage and you can't write stuff separated by spaces and I don't know who rights capital variables only if it's constants but we'll get to that later all right so now let's go to the or side of things what if we combine two things with an or if I asked you do you like pizza okay for sanity check assume you like pizza even if you don't okay so just to play along just imagine you like pizza so if I ask you do you like pizza or doing homework if you had to answer that with the true or false what would you say if you like pizza or doing math homework if you could

statement and some statement B if a is false and B is false then a and B you get back false right remember and so if you have again a being poison and B being homework poison and homework you get back false you like neither of them and if we have a or B since both of them are false it's still false and not a is just the opposite of that you get back true and same thing over here we have false and true false and true gives you back a false false and true you only need one thing to be true in or statements you get back a true and then not a which is saying you know opposite of a since a was false you get back a true ok so one thing I need you want you to notice about and operator and or operators if you look down the column of the end operator you'll only see one true case and the reason and the only reason why it's true is because both of the statements are true okay that's the key thing to remember both of the things are true and if you go and look in the or column you'll see the or being false only in one case and the only case is false is when both of the things are false okay so notice the key distinction between the two okay that's kind of all you have to know for a boolean stuff and I'm not going to go into the next video with the really long nested boolean statements it's kind of useless we don't really think that way anyways and we're gonna get into conditionals and control flow so I will see you guys there
