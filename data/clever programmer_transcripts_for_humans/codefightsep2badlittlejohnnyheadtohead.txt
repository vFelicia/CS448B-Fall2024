00:00 - what's up beautiful people welcome to
00:03 - another episode of code fights too with
00:06 - Kazi from clever programmer tom where
00:08 - you learned to code smarter so let's get
00:12 - this episode started we're gonna go
00:14 - ahead to head pick somebody to fight
00:17 - quick let's fight and let's get going
00:25 - alright dark can dark on let's go his
00:30 - language of choice is Java let's see if
00:33 - we can take him down with Python alright
00:39 - so we have a problem is power so
00:44 - essentially is this a power can you get
00:48 - this number by doing a ^ beat for 72 no
00:54 - you can't there's no power and you can't
00:56 - take any integer and raise it to some
00:58 - integer power it gets 72 if you do five
01:02 - cubes you could get 125 okay so you're
01:08 - checking if any a ^ B gives you this
01:11 - dunyah - there's not gonna be too much
01:15 - stuff that we're doing here this is a
01:17 - bug fix remember the first one is a bug
01:19 - fix so let's fix this bug and let's keep
01:23 - going let's hit start coding alright
01:27 - sometimes these books seem really
01:29 - annoying to fix sometimes not really so
01:31 - let's let's see if we can fix this one
01:32 - easily generally for bug fixes there
01:39 - you're not supposed to change anything
01:43 - you're supposed to keep it the same you
01:45 - just change one line you don't really
01:46 - add new lines let's check out these
01:48 - sample test cases you guys sometimes
01:52 - might not see the sample test cases cuz
01:54 - my face might be blocking it it might be
01:56 - behind me
01:58 - let me just run this so what I was
02:03 - expecting true and Trent false
02:07 - mmm looks like really like flip if n is
02:13 - equal to one return true I think this
02:20 - one I should change it to false let's
02:22 - see what happens it says you made too
02:25 - many changes oh no too many changes I
02:31 - made only one change you guys too many
02:37 - changes
02:37 - what is this constraint what does this
02:40 - even mean
02:48 - well what did you tell us how to solve
02:53 - it
02:55 - come on code fights where are my rules
02:58 - rules there's one bug on one line of the
03:03 - code find it fix it
03:06 - hit submit okay one bug on one line when
03:12 - I do it it says too many changes what
03:14 - does that even mean
03:15 - let me refresh it maybe there's some bug
03:23 - let me try it again
03:27 - false too many changes how about not
03:33 - true which is the same thing as false
03:35 - haha what is this what does that mean
03:41 - too many changes I'm making a change to
03:44 - only one line okay guys this is boring
03:47 - let's let's just skip it alright I'm
03:49 - just gonna skip it next I don't care
03:52 - down yep geez okay it looks like that
03:58 - person skipped it too so it looks like
04:00 - that problem was actually glitched so
04:02 - we're gonna just ignore that one okay
04:04 - problem two each strip each tree has a
04:08 - crown so it looks like this here's the
04:11 - formal definition of how the tree should
04:13 - be built before you read it the elf
04:16 - highly recommends looking first at the
04:18 - examples to follow okay so to share his
04:24 - let's just read the problem it's
04:25 - Christmas time to share his Christmas
04:27 - spirit all his friends on Christmas elf
04:30 - decided to send each of them a Christmas
04:33 - email with a nice Christmas tree
04:36 - unfortunately internet traffic is very
04:39 - expensive in the North Pole so instead
04:41 - of sending an actual image he decided to
04:43 - draw the tree using only asterisk okay
04:49 - weird but sure he has given you this bag
04:53 - see below in your task is to write a
04:55 - program that would generate trees
04:57 - following the spec and some initial
04:59 - parameters
05:00 - a Sri has a crown that looks as follows
05:05 - okay define the line as a horizontal
05:08 - group of asterisks and a level as as a
05:12 - collection of level height line stacked
05:14 - one on top of the other below the crown
05:18 - there are level number levels the trees
05:21 - perfectly symmetric so all the middle
05:24 - asterisks of the lines lie on the center
05:26 - of the tree okay each line to the same
05:32 - level wow these are some jacked trees
05:38 - huh so if you give the Christmas tree
05:42 - level num level height
05:44 - it makes the tree like this all right
05:48 - cool
05:50 - the crown level one the foot okay a lot
05:56 - of stuff going on here now the thing is
05:58 - we might not even have to understand the
06:00 - problem because there might be a
06:03 - recovery that we have to do so what is
06:07 - curved spaces hmm what the heck is
06:11 - curved spaces
06:12 - let's try max spaces minus one let's see
06:16 - if that yields the answer to be honest
06:22 - code fights you gotta get rid of these
06:24 - problems these problems are just bad
06:28 - though the ones with recovery and stuff
06:31 - just add problems where you have to
06:33 - solve them
06:33 - all right so weird having to do bug fix
06:36 - it's not really testing your coding
06:38 - skills alright so I'm essentially just
06:43 - trying to do some pattern matching here
06:45 - but let me see if I have to get smarter
06:48 - so I'm getting the wrong answer I'm off
06:51 - by off by what
06:58 - okay my face might be hiding the test
07:01 - cases but trust me the test cases are
07:05 - you know are there I'm looking at the
07:07 - test cases
07:20 - what the heck is going on here
07:31 - that's pretty much what we made
07:53 - max faces plus-one maybe it's min spaces
08:00 - I don't even know if men's faces the
08:02 - thing probably not
08:10 - that's not cur spaces is defined up here
08:14 - not exactly sure how good to file it
08:17 - find it down here max spaces - one was
08:25 - the closest we came like the two trees
08:29 - look exactly the same our output and
08:32 - expected output literally look pretty
08:37 - close actually not no no they definitely
08:45 - look a hundred percent the same but for
08:52 - whatever reason it's over not correct
08:57 - maybe a bug maybe
09:07 - next down vote let's skip this one -
09:10 - lets get to the next one okay this one
09:14 - will probably be a fun funner one
09:16 - because we actually get to write code
09:18 - rather than just bug fix this so let's
09:20 - get to it
09:20 - little boys mother didn't buy him a
09:23 - candy so now he's sulky and moody
09:24 - he turns everything you say upside down
09:27 - if you say that something is true heel
09:29 - sits false and vice versa find out what
09:34 - the boy will say about the statement
09:35 - you're about to make so the statement is
09:39 - false the output should be true if the
09:42 - statement should not but should be false
09:44 - what the hell just happened it just went
09:47 - from like these ridiculously hard and
09:52 - problematic and bugged out problems you
09:58 - know one-line solutions or whatever to
10:01 - just the easiest thing in the world like
10:04 - this is gonna be literally returned not
10:06 - whatever that was given it's gonna be
10:08 - like a is gonna take a second it's gonna
10:12 - come down to this look around if I write
10:14 - the solution that is faster than the
10:16 - other guy I went so the solution is
10:18 - gonna be return not something return not
10:23 - statement check the solution done yeah
10:28 - all right now we got to see if we did it
10:32 - faster than this guy because if we did
10:36 - we win now I'm gonna vote it down like
10:39 - what is this we know it's the easiest
10:41 - thing in the world all right guys
10:45 - that was awesome we killed it as you can
10:48 - see we were clearly better we outsmarted
10:53 - the other guy 100% and those great oh we
11:00 - we want okay doesn't it feel good to win
11:03 - this
11:03 - it was very hard-fought thank you guys
11:06 - for being there
11:07 - I appreciate you and if you liked it
11:11 - comment in the video below
11:14 - and I'll see you guys in the next video

like really like flip if n is equal to one return true I think this one I should change it to false let's see what happens it says you made too many changes oh no too many changes I made only one change you guys too many changes what is this constraint what does this even mean well what did you tell us how to solve it come on code fights where are my rules rules there's one bug on one line of

so all the middle asterisks of the lines lie on the center of the tree okay each line to the same level wow these are some jacked trees huh so if you give the Christmas tree level num level height it makes the tree like this all right cool the crown level one the foot okay a lot of stuff going on here now the thing is we might not even have to understand the problem because there might be a
