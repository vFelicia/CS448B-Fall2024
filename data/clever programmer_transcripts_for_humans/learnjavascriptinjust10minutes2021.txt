00:03 - designer and front-end developer and
00:05 - i've been making content with
00:06 - cleverprogrammer and today i'm gonna
00:08 - show you javascript basics
00:09 - and i'm gonna show you that by building
00:11 - the tesla website so let's get into it
00:13 - now before getting so deep into
00:15 - understanding why javascript is
00:17 - so important for today's modern world
00:19 - you know
00:20 - frameworks like react angular job
00:22 - openings are asking for a bunch of
00:24 - javascript developers
00:26 - web development is huge in the market

00:29 - advancing your career
00:31 - make sure you click the link in the
00:32 - description and join profit with
00:34 - javascript so that you can make this
00:36 - tier

00:38 - developer now before we jump into it
00:40 - make sure you smash the like button and
00:42 - subscribe to the channel if
00:44 - you want to see some banger content drop
00:46 - every week
00:47 - we are going deep in javascript deep and
00:49 - react and make sure you follow along
00:51 - with that said guys i cannot wait to
00:52 - show you javascript basics so let's get
00:54 - started
00:55 - in this video we're going to learn what
00:57 - is javascript how to use javascript
00:59 - the must-know concepts of javascript and
01:01 - then we're going to build this carousel
01:02 - from the tesla website
01:03 - so let's get started by looking at what
01:05 - is javascript
01:06 - javascript is the programming language
01:08 - that allows you to add behavior to your
01:10 - web
01:11 - basically anything that is cool that
01:13 - allows you to make your web page
01:14 - interactive and dynamic is javascript
01:16 - now
01:17 - there's a key definition when it comes
01:18 - to learning javascript and that
01:20 - is that javascript is a client-side
01:22 - scripting language
01:23 - that means that when you load a new page
01:25 - on the internet your computer will be
01:26 - sent a folder of files including at
01:28 - least one html file this html file will
01:30 - load the javascript file with the script
01:32 - tag that will hold the javascript code
01:34 - and this code will be in the same folder
01:35 - or from somewhere else in the internet
01:37 - now that we've understood what
01:38 - client-side scripting language means we
01:40 - can now understand how to
01:41 - actually use javascript in our web page
01:43 - so you can add javascript to your web
01:45 - page in multiple ways
01:46 - you can add it inside your html file
01:48 - inside the script tags in your body
01:50 - or you can add it in a separate
01:52 - javascript file and
01:53 - link the javascript file in your html
01:56 - again through the script tags
01:57 - now when it comes to learning the key
01:59 - concepts of javascript i have come up
02:00 - with an acronym
02:01 - and that is javascript is for
02:05 - very dope creators
02:09 - f is for functions v is for variables d
02:12 - is for dom
02:12 - o is for objects p is for primitives e
02:15 - is for events and c
02:16 - is for control flows so let's start with
02:18 - functions functions are blocks of code
02:20 - to perform a particular task so for
02:21 - example the classic button on click if
02:23 - you click on the button something's
02:25 - gonna happen
02:25 - so let's look at the general syntax of a
02:27 - javascript function the function is
02:28 - defined with the keyword function
02:30 - followed by the function's name
02:31 - in the parenthesis you can write the
02:33 - parameters that you're gonna need for
02:34 - your function
02:35 - and you would only add parameters based
02:36 - on what you want the function to execute
02:38 - inside the function you're gonna write
02:39 - everything that you want the function to
02:41 - do and lastly if you want the function
02:42 - to run you need to call the function so
02:44 - that is how you write a javascript
02:45 - function next we're gonna move on to
02:46 - variables
02:47 - variables are containers for storing
02:49 - data values when you want to declare a
02:51 - variable you use the var keyword
02:52 - followed by the variable name
02:54 - because variables store data we are
02:55 - going to assign the variable data so if
02:57 - we were creating a variable of a tesla
02:59 - card we would assign in the name as a
03:00 - string
03:01 - in javascript you can also assign
03:02 - numbers and arithmetic operations but we
03:05 - don't have to know all of that now all
03:06 - we have to focus on is that a variable
03:07 - can store data now i know that we're
03:09 - supposed to be looking at the dom
03:10 - but it is best to first present objects
03:12 - an object in javascript is just like an
03:14 - object in real life let's take for
03:16 - example the example of a car the car is
03:18 - gonna have characteristics that are
03:19 - going to be specific to that car it's
03:21 - gonna have an id
03:22 - a name how many wheels that does it have
03:25 - the what color is it is it red is it
03:27 - white
03:27 - and it would also have methods such as
03:29 - start break and stop
03:30 - now we've just looked at variables and
03:32 - we have learned that variables are
03:33 - container storing data values
03:35 - objects are also containers but objects
03:38 - contain multiple values
03:39 - so let's have a look at the syntax of an
03:41 - object you use the var keyword just like
03:43 - a variable you then declare the object's
03:45 - name
03:46 - and then you open two curly brackets and
03:48 - inside the curly brackets you store all
03:50 - the information that you want to store
03:51 - which are in name value pairs those are
03:54 - called properties and then you have
03:56 - methods methods are actions that can be
03:58 - performed by the object and in the
03:59 - example of the car the method could make
04:01 - the car move break and stop
04:03 - in javascript everything that is not an
04:04 - object is a primitive currently in
04:06 - modern javascript there are seven
04:08 - primitive types those are the string
04:10 - number big and boolean symbol null and
04:12 - undefined
04:13 - now there's something distinctive about
04:15 - primitive values and that is primitive
04:17 - values are immutable values
04:19 - let's take for example the example of a
04:20 - variable if we're creating a variable
04:22 - for a car
04:23 - and we store the information of a string
04:26 - we cannot change the value
04:28 - of the string the value is immutable
04:29 - what we can do is that we can reassign
04:31 - the value to the variable
04:33 - as we can see the meaning of every
04:34 - primitive type is pretty
04:35 - self-explanatory but there's
04:37 - two key primitive types that you must
04:38 - understand and those are undefined and
04:41 - null this has to do with the concept of
04:42 - time when we try to recall something
04:44 - that doesn't exist or doesn't exist
04:45 - anymore we get the value
04:47 - undefined but when we wish to use
04:49 - something that is empty
04:50 - then the primitive value is null now
04:52 - that we've covered object and primitives
04:54 - we can go back to the dom
04:56 - when a web page is loaded the browser
04:57 - creates a document object model of the
04:59 - page
04:59 - and what the html dom model looks like
05:02 - is a tree of object
05:03 - now the html dom is a standard object
05:05 - model and programming interface for html
05:08 - and it defines the html elements as
05:09 - objects and the object's respective
05:11 - properties and methods
05:12 - this object structure allows you to get
05:15 - change add and delete all the html
05:17 - elements with the javascript
05:18 - now let's have a look at how to access
05:20 - the html elements with the javascript we
05:22 - have a button with id
05:24 - demo and what we want to do is that we
05:25 - want to access it so that if we click it
05:28 - we can then console log a message so the
05:30 - way to access the element
05:32 - is by using the method in the object
05:35 - document
05:36 - which is the method get element by id
05:39 - which allows us to get the element with
05:42 - id
05:43 - demo in the document after storing this
05:46 - information in the variable btn we can
05:48 - then work with this html element
05:50 - in the javascript so in this particular
05:52 - case the reason why we want to access
05:54 - the html element of the button is
05:56 - because we then want to add
05:58 - an event listener which we're going to
06:00 - be looking at right after
06:02 - so now that we understood how to access
06:04 - html elements with the javascript we're
06:06 - going to learn
06:07 - events events are actions that happen to
06:09 - html elements
06:11 - now this can be something that the user
06:12 - does or something that the browser does
06:14 - now there's too many things to remember
06:15 - when it comes to events
06:17 - and that is that there are event
06:18 - handlers and the ad event listener
06:21 - method
06:21 - event handlers are attributes to your
06:23 - html element that means that if you have
06:25 - a button and you want a function to
06:26 - execute when you click on the button
06:28 - you would write button on click equals
06:31 - the function that you want to call
06:33 - all inside the html tag the way that you
06:35 - can write the function is that you can
06:37 - write
06:37 - the function inline or you can just
06:39 - write the name of the function that you
06:41 - want to call and write the function in
06:43 - your script tags the ad event list
06:44 - center method however
06:46 - attaches an event to a document that
06:48 - means that after accessing your html
06:50 - element
06:51 - in your javascript you would then add
06:53 - add event listener
06:54 - to that element the add event listener
06:56 - method takes three argument but you just
06:58 - need to know the first two
06:59 - that is the event and the function that
07:01 - you want to call when the event occurs
07:03 - so again in the case of a button you
07:05 - would write the variable storing the
07:06 - html element
07:08 - dot add event listener open parenthesis
07:10 - the event name
07:11 - and the function that you want to call
07:13 - and this is how you write
07:14 - a javascript event with addeventlistener
07:17 - now we're going to be looking at control
07:18 - flows
07:19 - the control flow is the order in which
07:20 - the computer executes statements in a
07:22 - script code is run in order from the
07:23 - first line of the file to the last line
07:25 - unless the computer runs across
07:27 - structures that change the control flow
07:29 - such as conditionals and loops
07:30 - let's take for example the example of a
07:32 - form the script will only submit data
07:34 - if the client fills out all the required
07:37 - fields to do this
07:38 - the script uses a conditional structure
07:40 - of if else
07:41 - so that different code executes
07:43 - depending on whether the form is
07:44 - complete or not
07:45 - next we're going to be looking at loops
07:47 - loops can execute code
07:49 - multiple times now there's many
07:51 - different types of loops in javascript
07:52 - but we're going to be looking at the for
07:54 - loop
07:54 - now let's have a look at how to write a
07:56 - for loop that is going to print each
07:58 - item in an array in a paragraph making
08:00 - sure that each item is racing on a
08:01 - different line
08:02 - so what we have is an array of card
08:04 - models called cars
08:05 - an empty string variable to store the
08:07 - data value of text and an undefined item
08:09 - variable
08:10 - and the for loop is saying that for the
08:12 - item i starting at zero and for every
08:14 - item in the array
08:16 - increment by one so go through every
08:18 - item in the array and apply this line of
08:20 - code to every single element
08:22 - then this line as we have learned by
08:23 - looking at the dom will print each item
08:25 - as a string in the paragraph empty
08:27 - element
08:28 - so that was a lot of information but
08:29 - this is to show how the for loop
08:32 - is a control flow that allows one line
08:35 - of code to be applied
08:36 - to multiple elements okay so now we're
08:38 - gonna put everything together
08:40 - and we are gonna recreate this carousel
08:42 - from the tesla website the first thing
08:43 - that we have to do is that we need to
08:44 - problem solve so we're gonna take a
08:46 - blank page and we're gonna focus
08:48 - on understanding the logic so first
08:50 - things first we already know that we're
08:51 - gonna be working with a collection of
08:52 - images
08:53 - for this carousel to work so the
08:54 - equivalent of that is that we're gonna
08:56 - be working with an array of images now
08:58 - any element inside an array
09:00 - has an index value the first element has
09:02 - index zero the second one is one
09:04 - two three and you're gonna see why this
09:06 - is so important to know
09:08 - now the logic of a carousel is that we
09:09 - have a button we're gonna start with the
09:11 - right one
09:12 - and every time we click on the button we
09:14 - want the next image to be displayed so
09:16 - let's take our index values
09:18 - and if we're saying every time we click
09:20 - on the button we want the next
09:22 - image we're essentially adding per click
09:24 - one to the current index value and this
09:27 - is called incrementing however this has
09:29 - to function based on a condition
09:31 - right we cannot increment forever we
09:33 - need this function to stop when it
09:35 - reaches the last image
09:36 - and when it reaches the last image we
09:38 - want the current image to go back to the
09:40 - first one so let's start writing this in
09:42 - code
09:42 - now i already prepared the html in this
09:44 - css file we have an image two buttons
09:47 - all stored inside the same container and
09:48 - notice how we are not declaring the
09:50 - length of the image with the src but we
09:53 - have declared the name of the image and
09:55 - we're going to use this to dynamically
09:56 - assign the src path of the image
09:58 - the first thing that we're going to do
09:59 - is that we are going to dynamically
10:01 - link the src path from our javascript so
10:04 - in our javascript we're gonna write
10:06 - document.slide.src and we will make that
10:08 - equal to the image path we're gonna go
10:09 - to our browser and we can see that works
10:11 - now we know that we're gonna be using a
10:13 - collection of
10:14 - images so i'm gonna create an array
10:16 - called images and in the array i'm going
10:18 - to insert a collection of
10:20 - links and i'm taking my images from on
10:21 - splash on unsplash you're going to type
10:24 - whatever you want
10:25 - i'm going to type tesla card i'm going
10:26 - to take that link and put it in my array
10:28 - next we're going to access the first
10:30 - link with its index
10:32 - number so we're gonna write images
10:33 - square bracket zero and that still works
10:35 - now we know that we will have three
10:37 - events that will make the image change
10:39 - we have the next button the previous
10:41 - button and the automatic slider
10:42 - and i'm gonna start with the right
10:44 - button and i'm going to call the button
10:46 - by calling its id so i will write
10:49 - document.getelementbyid write the id
10:51 - name now i already know that
10:52 - the src will not be defined by the first
10:55 - index we want that to be dynamic so i'm
10:57 - going to replace the 0 with an i
10:58 - and what i stands for is item next we're
11:01 - gonna start adding some events
11:02 - now the logic is that if i click on the
11:04 - right button i want the next image to
11:07 - display so the first thing that we're
11:08 - gonna do is that we're gonna add an
11:09 - event listener to the right button
11:11 - and that will be on click and we're
11:13 - gonna write a function
11:14 - now this function is going to have a
11:16 - condition and that is
11:18 - we're only going to increment so long as
11:20 - the current image
11:22 - does not surpass the total number of
11:23 - images inside the array
11:25 - for this reason we are going to add the
11:27 - if and else statement which
11:28 - is that if i is smaller than image's
11:31 - length
11:31 - minus one increment the index number by
11:34 - one from the current index that i'm at
11:36 - else make the index number zero which
11:38 - would then go back to the first image of
11:40 - the array
11:41 - now before anything we forgot a step
11:42 - which is to declare that the i
11:44 - is zero starts at zero and if we console
11:47 - log the
11:48 - i number per button click we will see
11:51 - the
11:51 - index number of the current image being
11:54 - displayed in the console log
11:55 - now notice that our numbers are 0 1 2
11:58 - that's because we have added
11:59 - three images so the first image index is
12:03 - 0 which means that if we have a total
12:06 - number of 3 the last index value will be
12:09 - two
12:09 - that is why the condition of the if
12:12 - statement is image's length minus one
12:14 - because the image's length will be the
12:16 - total number of items inside the array
12:18 - so if we have three images the last
12:21 - index value will be two because it will
12:22 - be zero
12:23 - one two in our drawing we put four
12:26 - images so the last index value is
12:28 - three but that is not to be confused
12:30 - because we have only added three images
12:32 - inside our array
12:33 - now all we did so far was dynamically
12:36 - change the index of the current image
12:37 - that we're in but we're not
12:39 - actually updating the current src link
12:42 - so the code block that is allowing us to
12:43 - do that
12:44 - is the document.slide.src images i
12:47 - and we want to call that inside this
12:49 - function however we already know that
12:51 - this
12:52 - code block of updating the image will
12:54 - occur when we click the right button the
12:56 - left button and also when the image is
12:58 - automatically sliding so we're gonna
12:59 - store this line in a separate function
13:01 - we're gonna call it set image so
13:03 - in our function we will write set image
13:05 - and when we go to our browser and click
13:06 - on the right button you can see that the
13:08 - images will change
13:09 - next we're going to move on to the
13:10 - automatic image slider now if you think
13:12 - about it the logic is exactly the same
13:14 - however this code block is not going to
13:16 - be called on a button click it will
13:18 - occur automatically
13:19 - when the window loads so what we're
13:21 - going to do is that we're going to take
13:22 - this code block and we will store it
13:24 - inside another function called
13:25 - slide image the conditions are exactly
13:27 - the same however we're going to
13:29 - call the function on window load and we
13:32 - will set a timeout
13:33 - so that we can declare the speed of the
13:35 - images change the slide out method takes
13:37 - two arguments which is the function
13:39 - and the time the unit of the time is in
13:41 - milliseconds and we could write the
13:42 - actual number inside the parentheses but
13:44 - i don't want to do that because if i
13:45 - want to change the value i don't want to
13:47 - be constantly editing
13:48 - the value inside the function so i'm
13:50 - going to create a time variable and i'm
13:52 - going to set it to the value
13:53 - of milliseconds that i want the slide
13:54 - images to automatically change and i'm
13:56 - going to set it to
13:57 - 2000 and then we're going to call the
14:00 - function on window unload that we've
14:02 - understood how to go to the next image
14:04 - let's think about how to go to the
14:06 - previous image this will happen with the
14:08 - left button
14:09 - and every time we click we want to
14:12 - decrement we want to go to the previous
14:14 - image so in index value we're gonna be
14:16 - subtracting one from the current index
14:19 - value that the
14:20 - the client is at and we're gonna have a
14:23 - button
14:23 - that on every click is going to
14:26 - subtract one of the current item index
14:30 - but again we cannot decrement forever
14:32 - and we can only decrement based on a
14:33 - condition and that condition is if the
14:35 - current image index
14:36 - is bigger than zero then decrement
14:39 - therefore remove one
14:41 - if the current index is not bigger than
14:44 - zero
14:44 - make the index value image's length
14:46 - minus one
14:47 - meaning the number of items in the array
14:50 - minus one which will give you in this
14:52 - case
14:52 - index three so the equivalent of that in
14:55 - code is
14:56 - first thing that we're gonna do is that
14:57 - we're gonna create a left button
14:59 - variable
15:00 - with get element id and then we're
15:02 - basically gonna write
15:03 - the same function as right button add
15:06 - event listener and then on the event
15:08 - click we'll call the function with the
15:10 - condition
15:12 - that if i is bigger than 0
15:15 - subtract 1 from the current item index
15:18 - and
15:18 - else make the index value of the current
15:22 - image
15:22 - the index of the last item in the array
15:25 - minus one let's look at how that looks
15:27 - on our browser
15:28 - now the slider is a little too fast so
15:31 - we're gonna change the time
15:32 - variable value we will set that to 5000
15:35 - so the image will change automatically
15:37 - every five seconds
15:38 - and that's one way of building the
15:39 - carousel on the tesla website alright
15:41 - guys so we just learned javascript
15:43 - basics we went to tesla.com and we
15:45 - applied
15:45 - everything that we learned in the
15:46 - beginning of the video which were the
15:48 - basics of javascript
15:49 - to build the actual tests like here's
15:51 - though i think these are the most
15:52 - important concepts when it comes to
15:54 - learning javascript and you're just a
15:55 - beginner
15:56 - that's why i wanted to handpick these
15:58 - for you because i think these would have
15:59 - been the most beneficial when i was
16:01 - first starting to learn javascript
16:03 - now guys like i mentioned at the
16:04 - beginning of the video make sure you
16:05 - like this video and subscribe to the
16:07 - channel and if
16:08 - you're serious about this and want to

Cleaned transcript:

what's up you guys vanintina here you guys probably don't know me i'm a designer and frontend developer and i've been making content with cleverprogrammer and today i'm gonna show you javascript basics and i'm gonna show you that by building the tesla website so let's get into it now before getting so deep into understanding why javascript is so important for today's modern world you know frameworks like react angular job openings are asking for a bunch of javascript developers web development is huge in the market right now if you're serious about advancing your career make sure you click the link in the description and join profit with javascript so that you can make this tier the year that you become a six figure developer now before we jump into it make sure you smash the like button and subscribe to the channel if you want to see some banger content drop every week we are going deep in javascript deep and react and make sure you follow along with that said guys i cannot wait to show you javascript basics so let's get started in this video we're going to learn what is javascript how to use javascript the mustknow concepts of javascript and then we're going to build this carousel from the tesla website so let's get started by looking at what is javascript javascript is the programming language that allows you to add behavior to your web basically anything that is cool that allows you to make your web page interactive and dynamic is javascript now there's a key definition when it comes to learning javascript and that is that javascript is a clientside scripting language that means that when you load a new page on the internet your computer will be sent a folder of files including at least one html file this html file will load the javascript file with the script tag that will hold the javascript code and this code will be in the same folder or from somewhere else in the internet now that we've understood what clientside scripting language means we can now understand how to actually use javascript in our web page so you can add javascript to your web page in multiple ways you can add it inside your html file inside the script tags in your body or you can add it in a separate javascript file and link the javascript file in your html again through the script tags now when it comes to learning the key concepts of javascript i have come up with an acronym and that is javascript is for very dope creators f is for functions v is for variables d is for dom o is for objects p is for primitives e is for events and c is for control flows so let's start with functions functions are blocks of code to perform a particular task so for example the classic button on click if you click on the button something's gonna happen so let's look at the general syntax of a javascript function the function is defined with the keyword function followed by the function's name in the parenthesis you can write the parameters that you're gonna need for your function and you would only add parameters based on what you want the function to execute inside the function you're gonna write everything that you want the function to do and lastly if you want the function to run you need to call the function so that is how you write a javascript function next we're gonna move on to variables variables are containers for storing data values when you want to declare a variable you use the var keyword followed by the variable name because variables store data we are going to assign the variable data so if we were creating a variable of a tesla card we would assign in the name as a string in javascript you can also assign numbers and arithmetic operations but we don't have to know all of that now all we have to focus on is that a variable can store data now i know that we're supposed to be looking at the dom but it is best to first present objects an object in javascript is just like an object in real life let's take for example the example of a car the car is gonna have characteristics that are going to be specific to that car it's gonna have an id a name how many wheels that does it have the what color is it is it red is it white and it would also have methods such as start break and stop now we've just looked at variables and we have learned that variables are container storing data values objects are also containers but objects contain multiple values so let's have a look at the syntax of an object you use the var keyword just like a variable you then declare the object's name and then you open two curly brackets and inside the curly brackets you store all the information that you want to store which are in name value pairs those are called properties and then you have methods methods are actions that can be performed by the object and in the example of the car the method could make the car move break and stop in javascript everything that is not an object is a primitive currently in modern javascript there are seven primitive types those are the string number big and boolean symbol null and undefined now there's something distinctive about primitive values and that is primitive values are immutable values let's take for example the example of a variable if we're creating a variable for a car and we store the information of a string we cannot change the value of the string the value is immutable what we can do is that we can reassign the value to the variable as we can see the meaning of every primitive type is pretty selfexplanatory but there's two key primitive types that you must understand and those are undefined and null this has to do with the concept of time when we try to recall something that doesn't exist or doesn't exist anymore we get the value undefined but when we wish to use something that is empty then the primitive value is null now that we've covered object and primitives we can go back to the dom when a web page is loaded the browser creates a document object model of the page and what the html dom model looks like is a tree of object now the html dom is a standard object model and programming interface for html and it defines the html elements as objects and the object's respective properties and methods this object structure allows you to get change add and delete all the html elements with the javascript now let's have a look at how to access the html elements with the javascript we have a button with id demo and what we want to do is that we want to access it so that if we click it we can then console log a message so the way to access the element is by using the method in the object document which is the method get element by id which allows us to get the element with id demo in the document after storing this information in the variable btn we can then work with this html element in the javascript so in this particular case the reason why we want to access the html element of the button is because we then want to add an event listener which we're going to be looking at right after so now that we understood how to access html elements with the javascript we're going to learn events events are actions that happen to html elements now this can be something that the user does or something that the browser does now there's too many things to remember when it comes to events and that is that there are event handlers and the ad event listener method event handlers are attributes to your html element that means that if you have a button and you want a function to execute when you click on the button you would write button on click equals the function that you want to call all inside the html tag the way that you can write the function is that you can write the function inline or you can just write the name of the function that you want to call and write the function in your script tags the ad event list center method however attaches an event to a document that means that after accessing your html element in your javascript you would then add add event listener to that element the add event listener method takes three argument but you just need to know the first two that is the event and the function that you want to call when the event occurs so again in the case of a button you would write the variable storing the html element dot add event listener open parenthesis the event name and the function that you want to call and this is how you write a javascript event with addeventlistener now we're going to be looking at control flows the control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script code is run in order from the first line of the file to the last line unless the computer runs across structures that change the control flow such as conditionals and loops let's take for example the example of a form the script will only submit data if the client fills out all the required fields to do this the script uses a conditional structure of if else so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not next we're going to be looking at loops loops can execute code multiple times now there's many different types of loops in javascript but we're going to be looking at the for loop now let's have a look at how to write a for loop that is going to print each item in an array in a paragraph making sure that each item is racing on a different line so what we have is an array of card models called cars an empty string variable to store the data value of text and an undefined item variable and the for loop is saying that for the item i starting at zero and for every item in the array increment by one so go through every item in the array and apply this line of code to every single element then this line as we have learned by looking at the dom will print each item as a string in the paragraph empty element so that was a lot of information but this is to show how the for loop is a control flow that allows one line of code to be applied to multiple elements okay so now we're gonna put everything together and we are gonna recreate this carousel from the tesla website the first thing that we have to do is that we need to problem solve so we're gonna take a blank page and we're gonna focus on understanding the logic so first things first we already know that we're gonna be working with a collection of images for this carousel to work so the equivalent of that is that we're gonna be working with an array of images now any element inside an array has an index value the first element has index zero the second one is one two three and you're gonna see why this is so important to know now the logic of a carousel is that we have a button we're gonna start with the right one and every time we click on the button we want the next image to be displayed so let's take our index values and if we're saying every time we click on the button we want the next image we're essentially adding per click one to the current index value and this is called incrementing however this has to function based on a condition right we cannot increment forever we need this function to stop when it reaches the last image and when it reaches the last image we want the current image to go back to the first one so let's start writing this in code now i already prepared the html in this css file we have an image two buttons all stored inside the same container and notice how we are not declaring the length of the image with the src but we have declared the name of the image and we're going to use this to dynamically assign the src path of the image the first thing that we're going to do is that we are going to dynamically link the src path from our javascript so in our javascript we're gonna write document.slide.src and we will make that equal to the image path we're gonna go to our browser and we can see that works now we know that we're gonna be using a collection of images so i'm gonna create an array called images and in the array i'm going to insert a collection of links and i'm taking my images from on splash on unsplash you're going to type whatever you want i'm going to type tesla card i'm going to take that link and put it in my array next we're going to access the first link with its index number so we're gonna write images square bracket zero and that still works now we know that we will have three events that will make the image change we have the next button the previous button and the automatic slider and i'm gonna start with the right button and i'm going to call the button by calling its id so i will write document.getelementbyid write the id name now i already know that the src will not be defined by the first index we want that to be dynamic so i'm going to replace the 0 with an i and what i stands for is item next we're gonna start adding some events now the logic is that if i click on the right button i want the next image to display so the first thing that we're gonna do is that we're gonna add an event listener to the right button and that will be on click and we're gonna write a function now this function is going to have a condition and that is we're only going to increment so long as the current image does not surpass the total number of images inside the array for this reason we are going to add the if and else statement which is that if i is smaller than image's length minus one increment the index number by one from the current index that i'm at else make the index number zero which would then go back to the first image of the array now before anything we forgot a step which is to declare that the i is zero starts at zero and if we console log the i number per button click we will see the index number of the current image being displayed in the console log now notice that our numbers are 0 1 2 that's because we have added three images so the first image index is 0 which means that if we have a total number of 3 the last index value will be two that is why the condition of the if statement is image's length minus one because the image's length will be the total number of items inside the array so if we have three images the last index value will be two because it will be zero one two in our drawing we put four images so the last index value is three but that is not to be confused because we have only added three images inside our array now all we did so far was dynamically change the index of the current image that we're in but we're not actually updating the current src link so the code block that is allowing us to do that is the document.slide.src images i and we want to call that inside this function however we already know that this code block of updating the image will occur when we click the right button the left button and also when the image is automatically sliding so we're gonna store this line in a separate function we're gonna call it set image so in our function we will write set image and when we go to our browser and click on the right button you can see that the images will change next we're going to move on to the automatic image slider now if you think about it the logic is exactly the same however this code block is not going to be called on a button click it will occur automatically when the window loads so what we're going to do is that we're going to take this code block and we will store it inside another function called slide image the conditions are exactly the same however we're going to call the function on window load and we will set a timeout so that we can declare the speed of the images change the slide out method takes two arguments which is the function and the time the unit of the time is in milliseconds and we could write the actual number inside the parentheses but i don't want to do that because if i want to change the value i don't want to be constantly editing the value inside the function so i'm going to create a time variable and i'm going to set it to the value of milliseconds that i want the slide images to automatically change and i'm going to set it to 2000 and then we're going to call the function on window unload that we've understood how to go to the next image let's think about how to go to the previous image this will happen with the left button and every time we click we want to decrement we want to go to the previous image so in index value we're gonna be subtracting one from the current index value that the the client is at and we're gonna have a button that on every click is going to subtract one of the current item index but again we cannot decrement forever and we can only decrement based on a condition and that condition is if the current image index is bigger than zero then decrement therefore remove one if the current index is not bigger than zero make the index value image's length minus one meaning the number of items in the array minus one which will give you in this case index three so the equivalent of that in code is first thing that we're gonna do is that we're gonna create a left button variable with get element id and then we're basically gonna write the same function as right button add event listener and then on the event click we'll call the function with the condition that if i is bigger than 0 subtract 1 from the current item index and else make the index value of the current image the index of the last item in the array minus one let's look at how that looks on our browser now the slider is a little too fast so we're gonna change the time variable value we will set that to 5000 so the image will change automatically every five seconds and that's one way of building the carousel on the tesla website alright guys so we just learned javascript basics we went to tesla.com and we applied everything that we learned in the beginning of the video which were the basics of javascript to build the actual tests like here's though i think these are the most important concepts when it comes to learning javascript and you're just a beginner that's why i wanted to handpick these for you because i think these would have been the most beneficial when i was first
