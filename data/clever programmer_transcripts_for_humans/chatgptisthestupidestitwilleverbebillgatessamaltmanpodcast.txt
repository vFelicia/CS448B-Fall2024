With timestamps:

00:00 - Sam Alman the founder of open Ai and
00:03 - Bill Gates sit down and have a
00:05 - conversation about Ai and chat GPT and
00:08 - these AI models and right before we jump
00:10 - into the reaction I do want to say that
00:12 - if you want to use Ai and chat GPT and
00:15 - learn how to make money with it I've put
00:17 - together a free 19-minute training below
00:19 - that shows you three app ideas that you
00:21 - could get started with today how to
00:22 - build apps with the I Chad GPT and do
00:24 - this even if you're a complete beginner
00:27 - this training will show you all
00:28 - completely free click the link below and
00:30 - sign up for the free training that said
00:32 - let's jump straight into the video right
00:33 - now I guess the we're looking a lot of
00:37 - productivity improvement from AI which
00:40 - you know that's overwhelmingly a very
00:42 - good thing which areas are you most
00:45 - excited about yeah so first of all I
00:47 - always think it's worth remembering that
00:48 - we're just sort of on this long
00:50 - continuous curve um so like right now we
00:53 - have an we have ai systems that can do
00:55 - tasks they certainly can't do jobs but
00:57 - they can do tasks and there's a
00:59 - productivity gain there
01:00 - eventually they'll be able to do more
01:02 - things that we think of like a job today
01:04 - um and so just some clarity there I
01:07 - think tasks
01:09 - are fix this specific coding bug job is
01:14 - be a developer for the company Chad GPT
01:17 - can't be a developer for the company
01:19 - right now it can't like think for you
01:22 - and do things for you automatically on
01:24 - its own it needs to be constantly
01:26 - prompted and assigned tasks that's kind
01:29 - of what you do when you have like an
01:30 - intern at your company you give them
01:32 - tasks but then when you have somebody
01:35 - who's a full-time employee and can take
01:38 - over a lot of the responsibility that's
01:40 - a job well of course find new jobs and
01:43 - better jobs and I totally believe that
01:45 - if you give people way more powerful
01:47 - tools it's not just they can work a
01:49 - little faster they can do qualitatively
01:50 - different things and so you know right
01:53 - now maybe we can speed up a programmer
01:54 - 3x is about what we see I me that's one
01:56 - of the categories that we're most
01:57 - excited about it's it's working super
01:59 - super well but if you make a programmer
02:01 - three times more effective it's not just
02:03 - that they can write they can do three
02:04 - times more stuff it's that they can at
02:06 - that higher level of abstraction using
02:09 - more of their brain power they can now
02:10 - think of totally different things and
02:12 - this is nothing new think when we used
02:14 - to code an assembly
02:16 - low-level
02:18 - language you would be typing bits and
02:20 - btes and memories and allocation and
02:24 - right then you get higher level
02:25 - programming languages Python and you
02:27 - think at a completely different level
02:29 - because
02:30 - all the lowlevel work is
02:32 - abstracted now think at a company
02:35 - level when the CEO doesn't have to be
02:38 - the engineer and the customer support
02:39 - and all these other things the CEO can
02:42 - think of a big vision and get everybody
02:44 - behind it think of Steve Jobs think of
02:46 - Bill Gates so the higher level you go
02:49 - the more abstract your thinking becomes
02:52 - and the more things you can attack and
02:54 - that's what he's saying so these
02:56 - Concepts should be nothing new these
02:58 - should logically make sense to all of
03:00 - you hopefully and it's like you know
03:02 - going from Punch Cards to higher level
03:03 - languages didn't just let us program a
03:06 - little faster let us do these
03:07 - qualitatively new things and we're we're
03:10 - really seeing that and so as we look at
03:12 - these next steps of things that can do a
03:14 - more complete task you can like imagine
03:16 - a little agent that you can say go write
03:18 - this whole program for me I'll ask you a
03:20 - few questions along the way but it won't
03:22 - just be writing a few functions at a
03:23 - time that'll enable a bunch of new stuff
03:26 - uh and then again it'll do even more
03:28 - complex stuff some maybe there's an AI
03:30 - where you can say you know go start and
03:32 - run this company for me and then someday
03:34 - there's maybe an AI where you can say
03:35 - like go discover new
03:37 - physics this is where Alex heroi talks
03:41 - about I don't know if you guys know him
03:43 - but he's an entrepreneur he's jacked and
03:45 - he kind of blew up overnight so you can
03:47 - look him up but he talks about the more
03:51 - advanced and valuable somebody is the
03:52 - more General tasks you can give them and
03:55 - basically the Dumber somebody is you can
03:57 - only give them you give them very
04:00 - specific tasks for example if you have
04:03 - somebody really valuable you would just
04:05 - go and tell them hey start me a $10
04:06 - million company tomorrow and that guy
04:09 - can go and figure that out and do it for
04:11 - you right uh like for example if you
04:14 - could hire Steve Jobs or Bill Gates how
04:17 - easily could they start a brand new
04:18 - company that would be worth a couple of
04:20 - million dollars probably very easy for
04:22 - them right or Elon
04:23 - Musk but then you take somebody who's
04:27 - kind of Dumber I don't know how else to
04:30 - say it right but this is that's just how
04:31 - I say it somebody who's Dumber you would
04:34 - have to tell them like press this button
04:35 - to actually turn on your computer or
04:37 - less skill let's say right you have to
04:39 - be like press this button to run this ad
04:42 - you have to get very microscopically
04:45 - specific and that's how it is with Chad
04:47 - GPT right now we have to be pretty
04:49 - specific with the scope it'll be like
04:51 - I'm sorry I don't understand but then in
04:53 - future hopefully you can say things like
04:55 - discover new physics or
04:57 - go start a new company on your behalf
05:01 - and then it should be able to do it all
05:02 - for
05:03 - you and it's the stuff that we're seeing
05:07 - now is very exciting and wonderful uh
05:09 - but I think it's worth always putting in
05:11 - context of this technology
05:13 - that at least for the next five or 10
05:16 - years will be on a very steep
05:17 - Improvement curve um these are the
05:19 - stupidest the models will ever be but
05:21 - coding is probably the area the single
05:23 - area from a productivity gain we're most
05:25 - excited about today uh massively
05:28 - deployed and you know it's SC usage at
05:30 - this point Healthcare and education are
05:32 - two things that are coming up that curve
05:33 - that we're very excited about too but
05:35 - the thing that's that is a little
05:37 - daunting is unlike previous technology
05:41 - improvements this one could improve very
05:45 - rapidly and there's kind of no upper
05:48 - bound I mean the idea that it achieves
05:51 - human levels on a lot of areas of work
05:54 - you know even if it's not doing unique
05:57 - science it you know can do support calls
06:00 - and sales calls I guess you and I do
06:03 - have some concern along with this good
06:06 - thing that it'll Force us to
06:09 - adapt faster than we've had to ever
06:13 - before that that's the scary part it's
06:15 - not that we have to adapt it's not that
06:18 - humanity is not super adaptable we've
06:20 - been through these massive technological
06:22 - shifts and a massive percentage of the
06:25 - jobs that people do can change over a
06:27 - couple of generations and over couple of
06:29 - generations we seem to absorb that just
06:32 - fine yeah so it's not so much we'll
06:35 - we'll adapt and we'll find ways to adapt
06:38 - but Bill Gates is right this is never
06:40 - happened before this level of Technology
06:43 - things that can think and improve on
06:44 - their own for example when you figured
06:47 - out how to have electricity in a house
06:51 - that's quite different right once
06:53 - electricity happened in the house that
06:56 - was it it was done right it wasn't like
06:58 - electricity kept improving its own self
07:01 - automatically whereas that will happen
07:03 - with AI where the more it trains on data
07:05 - the smarter it becomes automatically so
07:09 - it's going to kind of have an
07:10 - exponential weird curve of improvement
07:13 - versus a lot of other things however Sam
07:15 - is like yo we've seen improvements and
07:18 - we've seen crazy big shifts so humans
07:20 - will find a way to adapt I'm curious
07:22 - what he's going to say next I just want
07:23 - to comment on the point he made about
07:26 - coding yes coding is very exciting today
07:29 - and as much as you hear me say or other
07:31 - people say end of programming it might
07:33 - not be 5 to 10 years from now and even
07:35 - when we say end of programming it really
07:37 - might be the end of traditional coding
07:40 - jobs and how they look where you have
07:43 - software developers sitting there
07:44 - writing code it's going to morph into
07:46 - you becoming a project manager or a
07:50 - product manager who's going to be
07:52 - writing to AI to build things and you're
07:55 - going to be overseeing it like you have
07:57 - a bunch of Junior developers under you
07:58 - and then when there bugs you might go
08:00 - and check it out and see what what's
08:02 - happening but the bugs are going to be
08:04 - start being less and less likely as time
08:07 - goes on as it starts to get better and
08:09 - even debugging it might actually not be
08:11 - you coding debugging it might be giving
08:13 - it instructions and letting it debug hey
08:16 - why did you start it on port 8080 you
08:18 - should have started on Port 7000 hey why
08:21 - were using mongod
08:23 - DB we needed to use you to use Firebase
08:26 - for this you know that that level of
08:28 - debugging kind like you would when
08:30 - you're interacting with the developer so
08:33 - coding is an exciting time you should
08:35 - still learn it it's incredibly valuable
08:38 - but start using these AI tools and Chad
08:40 - GPT tools that exist we've seen that
08:43 - with the great technological Revolutions
08:45 - of the past each technological
08:47 - revolution has gotten faster and this
08:49 - will be the fastest by far and that's
08:52 - the part that I find potentially a
08:54 - little scary is that's what I was
08:55 - talking about where this is a technology
08:57 - Revolution that will be the fastest
09:00 - adding electricity wasn't that like it
09:02 - got added and then the incremental
09:04 - improvement from there to something else
09:05 - was not as fast right you had fire and
09:09 - then after fire I don't know whatever
09:10 - else happened then you got electricity
09:13 - but it was like it took a while to have
09:15 - that happen whereas Chad GPT 4 like
09:18 - three and four is like 10 20 50 times
09:21 - better like GPT 4 is incomparably better
09:24 - to gpt3 gpt3 just looks completely
09:27 - stupid compared to it
09:29 - gpt3 looks like a 10-year-old and GPT 4
09:32 - looks like a 29y old and the difference
09:35 - between a 10-year-old and 29y old in
09:37 - terms of intelligence usually isn't like
09:38 - two times or five times it's like 80
09:41 - times 100 times the difference is really
09:43 - really
09:45 - wild just the speed with which society
09:49 - is going to have to adapt and that the
09:50 - labor market will change one aspect uh
09:53 - of AI is is robotics or blue collar jobs
09:58 - when you get you sort of hands and feet
10:02 - uh that are at human level capability
10:04 - and you know the incredible chat GPT
10:08 - breakthrough has kind of gotten us
10:10 - focused on the white thank you for not
10:11 - saying Chad GTP I mean how many of you
10:15 - watching this Chad say Chad GTP like
10:17 - what the [ __ ] is that who started that
10:20 - like why are there so many like majority
10:22 - of the people say GTP I don't understand
10:25 - thank you Bill Gates for saying it right
10:27 - caller thing which is super appropriate
10:30 - but I do worry people are losing the
10:33 - focus on the blue collar piece so how do
10:35 - you see robotics super excited for that
10:38 - we started robots too early um and so we
10:41 - had to put that project on hold it was
10:43 - hard for the wrong reasons it wasn't
10:45 - helping us make progress with the
10:47 - difficult parts of the ml research and
10:50 - you know we were like dealing with bad
10:51 - simulators and breaking tendons and
10:53 - things like that and also we realized
10:56 - more and more over time that what we
10:57 - really first needed was intelligence and
11:00 - cognition and then we could figure out
11:01 - how to adapt it to physicality and it
11:03 - was easier to start with that with the
11:05 - way we've built these language models
11:07 - but we have I never thought about that
11:09 - that's actually really smart yeah cuz
11:11 - you end up wasting time on building the
11:13 - robot back up because he broke his
11:14 - freaking arm instead of working on the
11:17 - actual thinking of the robot and so huh
11:21 - that's why they decided not to do robots
11:23 - and just focus on the intelligence and
11:24 - cognition part very cool always planned
11:27 - to come back to it we've started
11:29 - investing a little bit in robotics
11:30 - companies I think on the physical
11:32 - Hardware side there's finally for the
11:34 - first time that I've ever seen really
11:36 - exciting new platforms being built there
11:39 - and at some point we will be able to use
11:42 - our models as you were saying with their
11:45 - language understanding and future video
11:46 - understanding to say all right like
11:48 - let's do amazing things with a with a
11:51 - robot but it's the hardware guys you
11:54 - know who've done a good job on legs
11:55 - actually get the arms hands fingers
11:59 - piece and then we couple it you know and
12:01 - it's not ridiculously
12:03 - expensive that could change the job
12:06 - market for a lot of the the blue collar
12:09 - type work pretty rapidly certainly the
12:12 - the prediction like the consensus
12:14 - prediction if we rewind seven or 10
12:16 - years was that the impact was going to
12:18 - be blue colar work first white colar
12:21 - work second creativity maybe never but
12:23 - certainly last cuz that was magic and
12:25 - human obviously it's gone exactly the
12:26 - other direction and I think there's like
12:29 - a lot of interesting takeaways about why
12:31 - that happened you know creative work act
12:33 - ah interesting so it was like creativity
12:37 - would be the last thing and now
12:39 - creativity is the first thing being
12:41 - taken away interesting because a lot of
12:42 - people you see using Chad GPT right now
12:44 - will use it to write their emails we'll
12:46 - use it to send messages to people we'll
12:49 - use it
12:50 - to um come up with content ideas and so
12:55 - if you think about it it's actually a
12:56 - lot of creative work creative thinking
12:58 - that we kind of assigning to Chad GPT
13:00 - which is interesting I didn't actually
13:01 - think about it like that even when I'm
13:03 - brainstorming with Chad GPT often times
13:05 - it's very deliberate like hard decision
13:09 - making and thinking and I'm having a
13:11 - back and
13:12 - forth interesting and so if but
13:16 - eventually once it turns into Robotics
13:18 - and gets physicality then it'll start to
13:20 - take over you know Constructor
13:24 - construction working jobs which will be
13:27 - a hard thing to achieve physicality wise
13:30 - and cognitive wise and all of that for
13:32 - it to achieve I don't think that's
13:33 - happening anytime soon I would I might
13:38 - have to guess like 10 years 20 years um
13:41 - who knows it might happen soon and blow
13:43 - my mind but I just feel like that's
13:44 - really
13:45 - complex cuz if you even look at Tesla
13:48 - right the car can barely drive itself
13:50 - like it runs into crashes and has bugs
13:54 - right people have died because of that
13:56 - and so to have things that are creating
13:59 - buildings you don't want to make a
14:00 - mistake there right and then the
14:02 - building breaks down and it endangers so
14:05 - many people's lives so very curious
14:07 - about that but very interesting that the
14:09 - blue collar jobs will be the last ones
14:11 - kind of Taken actually the
14:13 - hallucinations of the the GPT models is
14:16 - a is a feature not a bug it lets you
14:18 - discover some new things whereas if
14:19 - you're you know having a robot move
14:21 - heavy machinery around you better be
14:23 - really precise with that and I think
14:25 - this is just a case of you've got to
14:27 - follow where technology go and you have
14:29 - preconceptions but sometimes the science
14:32 - doesn't want to go that way interesting
14:35 - so instead of making your own
14:36 - assumptions it's better to see where
14:39 - technolog is actually going and just
14:41 - follow the science step by step rather
14:43 - than I think this is what's going to
14:44 - happen because that might change because
14:46 - people thought robots would happen first
14:48 - well it's ch GPT happening first which
14:50 - is interesting because like I would
14:52 - think it'd be easier to make a robot
14:54 - that goes and does stuff for you right
14:56 - brings you cake or some [ __ ] but
14:58 - apparently
14:59 - it was easier to invent this thing that
15:01 - could solve any [ __ ] problem like
15:03 - what like I would that's crazy like if
15:07 - you think about Chad GPT I mean now
15:08 - we're kind of normalized to it but it's
15:11 - insane and I was thinking we would have
15:14 - a robot that would bring me freaking
15:17 - water and so it's going the other way
15:20 - and so that's the way that we should
15:21 - actually look at it from but yes this is
15:23 - the stupidest these models will ever be
15:25 - so if you find that interesting at any
15:28 - level and you want to be like yo how can
15:31 - I use chat GPT and and how can I use
15:34 - these tools to learn how to build apps
15:37 - learn how to make money with it any of
15:39 - these things if any of that makes you
15:41 - interested or even slightly curious I
15:43 - have a 19-minute short free training for
15:45 - you below in the description go check it
15:47 - out because in that training we're going
15:49 - to go through and talk about Chad GPT
15:51 - we're going to talk about AI we're going
15:53 - to talk about the three app ideas that
15:55 - you could build and even if you're a
15:59 - complete beginner this training will fit
16:01 - you and even if you're a developer this
16:04 - will help you so it's 19 minutes of pure
16:06 - value click the link in the description
16:08 - join the training I'd love to see you
16:09 - inside with that said I hope you enjoyed
16:11 - the video peace

Cleaned transcript:

Sam Alman the founder of open Ai and Bill Gates sit down and have a conversation about Ai and chat GPT and these AI models and right before we jump into the reaction I do want to say that if you want to use Ai and chat GPT and learn how to make money with it I've put together a free 19minute training below that shows you three app ideas that you could get started with today how to build apps with the I Chad GPT and do this even if you're a complete beginner this training will show you all completely free click the link below and sign up for the free training that said let's jump straight into the video right now I guess the we're looking a lot of productivity improvement from AI which you know that's overwhelmingly a very good thing which areas are you most excited about yeah so first of all I always think it's worth remembering that we're just sort of on this long continuous curve um so like right now we have an we have ai systems that can do tasks they certainly can't do jobs but they can do tasks and there's a productivity gain there eventually they'll be able to do more things that we think of like a job today um and so just some clarity there I think tasks are fix this specific coding bug job is be a developer for the company Chad GPT can't be a developer for the company right now it can't like think for you and do things for you automatically on its own it needs to be constantly prompted and assigned tasks that's kind of what you do when you have like an intern at your company you give them tasks but then when you have somebody who's a fulltime employee and can take over a lot of the responsibility that's a job well of course find new jobs and better jobs and I totally believe that if you give people way more powerful tools it's not just they can work a little faster they can do qualitatively different things and so you know right now maybe we can speed up a programmer 3x is about what we see I me that's one of the categories that we're most excited about it's it's working super super well but if you make a programmer three times more effective it's not just that they can write they can do three times more stuff it's that they can at that higher level of abstraction using more of their brain power they can now think of totally different things and this is nothing new think when we used to code an assembly lowlevel language you would be typing bits and btes and memories and allocation and right then you get higher level programming languages Python and you think at a completely different level because all the lowlevel work is abstracted now think at a company level when the CEO doesn't have to be the engineer and the customer support and all these other things the CEO can think of a big vision and get everybody behind it think of Steve Jobs think of Bill Gates so the higher level you go the more abstract your thinking becomes and the more things you can attack and that's what he's saying so these Concepts should be nothing new these should logically make sense to all of you hopefully and it's like you know going from Punch Cards to higher level languages didn't just let us program a little faster let us do these qualitatively new things and we're we're really seeing that and so as we look at these next steps of things that can do a more complete task you can like imagine a little agent that you can say go write this whole program for me I'll ask you a few questions along the way but it won't just be writing a few functions at a time that'll enable a bunch of new stuff uh and then again it'll do even more complex stuff some maybe there's an AI where you can say you know go start and run this company for me and then someday there's maybe an AI where you can say like go discover new physics this is where Alex heroi talks about I don't know if you guys know him but he's an entrepreneur he's jacked and he kind of blew up overnight so you can look him up but he talks about the more advanced and valuable somebody is the more General tasks you can give them and basically the Dumber somebody is you can only give them you give them very specific tasks for example if you have somebody really valuable you would just go and tell them hey start me a $10 million company tomorrow and that guy can go and figure that out and do it for you right uh like for example if you could hire Steve Jobs or Bill Gates how easily could they start a brand new company that would be worth a couple of million dollars probably very easy for them right or Elon Musk but then you take somebody who's kind of Dumber I don't know how else to say it right but this is that's just how I say it somebody who's Dumber you would have to tell them like press this button to actually turn on your computer or less skill let's say right you have to be like press this button to run this ad you have to get very microscopically specific and that's how it is with Chad GPT right now we have to be pretty specific with the scope it'll be like I'm sorry I don't understand but then in future hopefully you can say things like discover new physics or go start a new company on your behalf and then it should be able to do it all for you and it's the stuff that we're seeing now is very exciting and wonderful uh but I think it's worth always putting in context of this technology that at least for the next five or 10 years will be on a very steep Improvement curve um these are the stupidest the models will ever be but coding is probably the area the single area from a productivity gain we're most excited about today uh massively deployed and you know it's SC usage at this point Healthcare and education are two things that are coming up that curve that we're very excited about too but the thing that's that is a little daunting is unlike previous technology improvements this one could improve very rapidly and there's kind of no upper bound I mean the idea that it achieves human levels on a lot of areas of work you know even if it's not doing unique science it you know can do support calls and sales calls I guess you and I do have some concern along with this good thing that it'll Force us to adapt faster than we've had to ever before that that's the scary part it's not that we have to adapt it's not that humanity is not super adaptable we've been through these massive technological shifts and a massive percentage of the jobs that people do can change over a couple of generations and over couple of generations we seem to absorb that just fine yeah so it's not so much we'll we'll adapt and we'll find ways to adapt but Bill Gates is right this is never happened before this level of Technology things that can think and improve on their own for example when you figured out how to have electricity in a house that's quite different right once electricity happened in the house that was it it was done right it wasn't like electricity kept improving its own self automatically whereas that will happen with AI where the more it trains on data the smarter it becomes automatically so it's going to kind of have an exponential weird curve of improvement versus a lot of other things however Sam is like yo we've seen improvements and we've seen crazy big shifts so humans will find a way to adapt I'm curious what he's going to say next I just want to comment on the point he made about coding yes coding is very exciting today and as much as you hear me say or other people say end of programming it might not be 5 to 10 years from now and even when we say end of programming it really might be the end of traditional coding jobs and how they look where you have software developers sitting there writing code it's going to morph into you becoming a project manager or a product manager who's going to be writing to AI to build things and you're going to be overseeing it like you have a bunch of Junior developers under you and then when there bugs you might go and check it out and see what what's happening but the bugs are going to be start being less and less likely as time goes on as it starts to get better and even debugging it might actually not be you coding debugging it might be giving it instructions and letting it debug hey why did you start it on port 8080 you should have started on Port 7000 hey why were using mongod DB we needed to use you to use Firebase for this you know that that level of debugging kind like you would when you're interacting with the developer so coding is an exciting time you should still learn it it's incredibly valuable but start using these AI tools and Chad GPT tools that exist we've seen that with the great technological Revolutions of the past each technological revolution has gotten faster and this will be the fastest by far and that's the part that I find potentially a little scary is that's what I was talking about where this is a technology Revolution that will be the fastest adding electricity wasn't that like it got added and then the incremental improvement from there to something else was not as fast right you had fire and then after fire I don't know whatever else happened then you got electricity but it was like it took a while to have that happen whereas Chad GPT 4 like three and four is like 10 20 50 times better like GPT 4 is incomparably better to gpt3 gpt3 just looks completely stupid compared to it gpt3 looks like a 10yearold and GPT 4 looks like a 29y old and the difference between a 10yearold and 29y old in terms of intelligence usually isn't like two times or five times it's like 80 times 100 times the difference is really really wild just the speed with which society is going to have to adapt and that the labor market will change one aspect uh of AI is is robotics or blue collar jobs when you get you sort of hands and feet uh that are at human level capability and you know the incredible chat GPT breakthrough has kind of gotten us focused on the white thank you for not saying Chad GTP I mean how many of you watching this Chad say Chad GTP like what the [ __ ] is that who started that like why are there so many like majority of the people say GTP I don't understand thank you Bill Gates for saying it right caller thing which is super appropriate but I do worry people are losing the focus on the blue collar piece so how do you see robotics super excited for that we started robots too early um and so we had to put that project on hold it was hard for the wrong reasons it wasn't helping us make progress with the difficult parts of the ml research and you know we were like dealing with bad simulators and breaking tendons and things like that and also we realized more and more over time that what we really first needed was intelligence and cognition and then we could figure out how to adapt it to physicality and it was easier to start with that with the way we've built these language models but we have I never thought about that that's actually really smart yeah cuz you end up wasting time on building the robot back up because he broke his freaking arm instead of working on the actual thinking of the robot and so huh that's why they decided not to do robots and just focus on the intelligence and cognition part very cool always planned to come back to it we've started investing a little bit in robotics companies I think on the physical Hardware side there's finally for the first time that I've ever seen really exciting new platforms being built there and at some point we will be able to use our models as you were saying with their language understanding and future video understanding to say all right like let's do amazing things with a with a robot but it's the hardware guys you know who've done a good job on legs actually get the arms hands fingers piece and then we couple it you know and it's not ridiculously expensive that could change the job market for a lot of the the blue collar type work pretty rapidly certainly the the prediction like the consensus prediction if we rewind seven or 10 years was that the impact was going to be blue colar work first white colar work second creativity maybe never but certainly last cuz that was magic and human obviously it's gone exactly the other direction and I think there's like a lot of interesting takeaways about why that happened you know creative work act ah interesting so it was like creativity would be the last thing and now creativity is the first thing being taken away interesting because a lot of people you see using Chad GPT right now will use it to write their emails we'll use it to send messages to people we'll use it to um come up with content ideas and so if you think about it it's actually a lot of creative work creative thinking that we kind of assigning to Chad GPT which is interesting I didn't actually think about it like that even when I'm brainstorming with Chad GPT often times it's very deliberate like hard decision making and thinking and I'm having a back and forth interesting and so if but eventually once it turns into Robotics and gets physicality then it'll start to take over you know Constructor construction working jobs which will be a hard thing to achieve physicality wise and cognitive wise and all of that for it to achieve I don't think that's happening anytime soon I would I might have to guess like 10 years 20 years um who knows it might happen soon and blow my mind but I just feel like that's really complex cuz if you even look at Tesla right the car can barely drive itself like it runs into crashes and has bugs right people have died because of that and so to have things that are creating buildings you don't want to make a mistake there right and then the building breaks down and it endangers so many people's lives so very curious about that but very interesting that the blue collar jobs will be the last ones kind of Taken actually the hallucinations of the the GPT models is a is a feature not a bug it lets you discover some new things whereas if you're you know having a robot move heavy machinery around you better be really precise with that and I think this is just a case of you've got to follow where technology go and you have preconceptions but sometimes the science doesn't want to go that way interesting so instead of making your own assumptions it's better to see where technolog is actually going and just follow the science step by step rather than I think this is what's going to happen because that might change because people thought robots would happen first well it's ch GPT happening first which is interesting because like I would think it'd be easier to make a robot that goes and does stuff for you right brings you cake or some [ __ ] but apparently it was easier to invent this thing that could solve any [ __ ] problem like what like I would that's crazy like if you think about Chad GPT I mean now we're kind of normalized to it but it's insane and I was thinking we would have a robot that would bring me freaking water and so it's going the other way and so that's the way that we should actually look at it from but yes this is the stupidest these models will ever be so if you find that interesting at any level and you want to be like yo how can I use chat GPT and and how can I use these tools to learn how to build apps learn how to make money with it any of these things if any of that makes you interested or even slightly curious I have a 19minute short free training for you below in the description go check it out because in that training we're going to go through and talk about Chad GPT we're going to talk about AI we're going to talk about the three app ideas that you could build and even if you're a complete beginner this training will fit you and even if you're a developer this will help you so it's 19 minutes of pure value click the link in the description join the training I'd love to see you inside with that said I hope you enjoyed the
