00:12 - really quick and he and i are going to
00:14 - be riffing about
00:15 - is college worth it for uh programmers
00:18 - so i currently have my video on my
00:21 - screen i should be here
00:23 - um but yeah we're gonna be going over is
00:26 - college worth it for
00:27 - programmers in 2020 uh and beyond
00:30 - so uh we're just going to be having a
00:32 - conversation really here
00:34 - hey guys aaron here from clever progress
00:35 - pros and cons i'm here with daniel
00:37 - so we just kind of want to touch on he's
00:38 - never actually been on a stream before
00:40 - but um
00:56 - i'll go ahead and answer that with my
00:58 - story so yeah we're gonna guarantee that
00:59 - i need to call it more safer currently i
01:02 - am a software engineer working for blue
01:04 - origin
01:05 - if you guys don't know me having fortune
01:07 - is hey guys
01:21 - just give it some time man how long
01:23 - you've been working there for a couple
01:25 - of years now
01:25 - i've been working there almost for like
01:27 - about three years now almost three years
01:29 - yeah so i'll go ahead almost three years
01:31 - in january
01:33 - and it's basically my background
01:35 - currently i went to college
01:52 - is
02:02 - because it's one of those universities
02:20 - is
02:35 - know
02:49 - oh god guys
03:05 - [Music]
03:08 - i'm not going to be able to do anything
03:10 - i'm not going to be able to achieve
03:11 - much at all right but over the last over
03:14 - those four years that i was working
03:16 - i was actually not just focused on
03:17 - school but i was working outside of
03:19 - school as well i was getting externships
03:21 - basically externship is like an
03:22 - internship where you work for free and
03:24 - i was just trying to get i never heard
03:25 - that before externships right so it's
03:27 - just for the experience that's exactly
03:28 - why you do that right
03:30 - okay yeah and and i was like i was going
03:33 - to do
03:33 - put in the work work for free to learn
03:35 - mobile development because that's kind
03:36 - of what i was going into that's kind of
03:38 - what i was a little bit passionate about
03:40 - there but
03:40 - i was really active trying to learn as
03:42 - much as i could trying to build up my
03:43 - technical skill set and
03:45 - in the matter of the four years when i
03:46 - graduated i was actually able to
03:48 - graduate with offers from big tech
03:50 - companies so i had an offer from
03:51 - youtube google and i had an offer for
03:53 - microsoft and had offered from blue
03:55 - origin
03:55 - so it was crazy because what i wanted to
03:58 - what i learned was
04:00 - it's not about where you are or where
04:02 - you're starting from
04:03 - it's about where you end up and then
04:05 - what are the things that you're going to
04:06 - do there to end up so
04:08 - everyone and even aaron knows this what
04:10 - we're about to say
04:12 - might actually disappoint you might go
04:14 - against everything you believe in this
04:15 - life call about what college is
04:17 - and whether you need it or whether
04:18 - you're not we'll be discussing all those
04:20 - things
04:20 - but what you have to realize is
04:22 - regardless whatever path you take
04:25 - you can still build that future that you
04:27 - want for yourself if you want to become
04:29 - though
04:30 - one second guys they said there's voice
04:31 - problems voice problems 100 guys talking
04:34 - now let me mute you on
04:35 - speak again
04:38 - oh speak again daniel testing testing
04:43 - um yo guys can you guys hear me
04:46 - audio problem audio problem sorry guys
04:50 - i didn't see you guys in the chat the
04:51 - voices are looping
04:54 - oh [ __ ]
04:58 - voices are looping as i like feedback
05:01 - probably is it still looping you guys
05:04 - oh [ __ ] and then the stream is is uh
05:08 - loading
05:17 - um it might still be going
05:21 - yo is okay hey can you guys hear me
05:24 - it is solved now it's okay great now
05:26 - it's fine perfect perfect you guys hear
05:28 - me
05:29 - am i good okay yeah they're saying audio
05:31 - is great it's good enough
05:32 - awesome uh i don't know how much you got
05:34 - screwed up there
05:36 - but uh yeah i'll recap super quick
05:39 - got it right big lesson big lesson is
05:42 - it doesn't matter where you start what
05:44 - matters is where you want to end up
05:46 - and what it is that you're going to do
05:48 - what work are you going to put in
05:50 - to be able to get to that spot so that's
05:52 - being a freelancer
05:53 - what projects are you going to take on
05:55 - what mentors are you going to get across
05:56 - what community are you going to put
05:57 - yourself
05:58 - in to learn the technical skill sets to
06:00 - learn the soft skill sets that you need
06:02 - to become the freelancer that is living
06:04 - that free or basically that
06:06 - lifestyle where you're your own boss
06:07 - you're working on your own time
06:09 - you have time to enjoy with your family
06:10 - you have time to enjoy life or
06:12 - if you want to go to the corporate world
06:14 - and go up the corporate ladder right
06:16 - where you actually you know you get the
06:18 - job they want at big tech company you
06:20 - get the nice 401k compensation that they
06:22 - give you which is awesome and all that
06:23 - good stuff
06:24 - then what are the things that you have
06:25 - to do whether it's academic or
06:27 - non-academic
06:28 - to get to that point and those are some
06:30 - of the things that we're going to be
06:30 - discussing today because you might
06:32 - or might not need college depending on
06:34 - your situation
06:36 - definitely definitely and
06:39 - yeah i think it really depends yeah it
06:41 - definitely depends on your situation
06:42 - what's interesting about you daniel is
06:44 - you're currently working at blue origin
06:46 - as a software developer which is awesome
06:47 - amazing but you're also kind of doing
06:48 - some business stuff on the side right
06:50 - like more freelance based
06:51 - uh so well first of all for for your job
06:54 - at blue origin was your degree useful
06:56 - did you already mention that
06:57 - and like landing the lining the
06:59 - interviews or or
07:01 - um like it being on your resume was it
07:03 - helpful
07:04 - so that's a great question and you know
07:07 - this is something that i've talked a lot
07:08 - about with my friend
07:10 - so here's the thing when big tech
07:12 - companies are trying to hire for someone
07:14 - the thing is they're getting so many
07:17 - applications they're getting hit with
07:18 - like thousands and thousands of
07:20 - applications per day
07:21 - that's why they're such a low acceptance
07:23 - rate right it's not necessarily because
07:25 - they only accept these geniuses
07:27 - they accept people who put in the work
07:28 - who learned the skill but it's just
07:30 - because so many people
07:31 - are applying it's kind of like the mecca
07:33 - and everyone's trying to just travel
07:35 - there
07:35 - and google's like hey we can't hire any
07:38 - everyone so
07:39 - we have to have that filtering process
07:40 - so that's what that filtering process
07:42 - starts with
07:42 - which is the resume now very often
07:45 - because recruiters have that system set
07:46 - up they'll be like hey
07:47 - you know maybe find me someone that has
07:49 - a higher gpa than
07:51 - whatever that may be or filter it in
07:53 - these mechanisms
07:54 - so if you do the traditional path which
07:57 - is what i'll tell my friend
07:58 - if you're the traditional path where you
08:00 - go to school then in that case maybe the
08:01 - grades might be a little bit important
08:03 - to get that filtering mechanism but
08:04 - after that
08:05 - no am i allowed to cuss yeah it's fine
08:08 - okay i mean like cussing is fine just no
08:10 - sensitive topics like youtube's
08:12 - signboard fine with custom just know
08:13 - like
08:14 - controversial stuff you know stay
08:16 - politically correct okay that's what i'm
08:17 - saying
08:18 - i'll say pc then look like after that
08:21 - like google doesn't give a [ __ ]
08:22 - about what your gpa was after you
08:25 - graduate they want to see if you
08:27 - can produce if you can write code if you
08:29 - can actually
08:30 - help them develop whatever product it is
08:32 - that the team is trying to hire you
08:34 - so what that means for you is you know
08:37 - after that initial filtering phase if
08:38 - you go to traditional path with high
08:40 - school or
08:40 - sorry with college if you have a good
08:42 - gpa at that point it's all about
08:44 - what projects have you developed what
08:46 - things have you actually done
08:48 - that shows that you're proactive about
08:50 - getting that experience that shows that
08:52 - you're passionate
08:53 - about programming and developing
08:55 - software now here's the cool thing
08:57 - right there's also other ways that you
08:59 - can get past that filtering mechanism
09:01 - if you don't have a background in
09:03 - computer science but you're still going
09:05 - to need
09:05 - that other component of showing that you
09:07 - have the experience which is
09:08 - building the projects which is working
09:10 - with teammates which is have you know
09:11 - mentoring people being inside
09:13 - of an amazing community like the profit
09:15 - with javascript community right
09:17 - and the reason i'm saying that is
09:18 - because the way you can now go around
09:20 - that is maybe you do networking
09:21 - you get to know someone that can be a
09:23 - referral or whatever that may be we
09:24 - could dive into those details if anyone
09:26 - wants to know those details but
09:28 - the important thing is you still need
09:29 - the practice you still need
09:31 - the experience because they're putting a
09:33 - risk
09:34 - to hiring you right they're like hey man
09:37 - like you've shown all these things we
09:38 - don't know if it's going to work out or
09:39 - not
09:39 - but let's bring you on so they at least
09:42 - want to make sure
09:43 - it's it's not to risk for them because
09:45 - they're absolutely crushing it
09:46 - with whatever side projects it is that
09:49 - you might have going on
09:50 - plus you're learning you're proactive it
09:51 - just shows you as an individual
09:53 - who's willing to take action to move
09:55 - forward and learn
09:56 - and do the things that you have to do to
09:58 - excel at that job
10:00 - got it thanks daniel yeah yeah this
10:03 - that's a really good point
10:04 - um i mean yeah from my point of view
10:07 - uh to to add on to that point uh
10:09 - personally
10:10 - um oh you lost daniel there for a second
10:13 - are you there yeah yeah yeah
10:15 - okay yeah i was trying to switch the
10:16 - camera i'm gonna mess with it a little
10:17 - more to
10:18 - switch but keep going brother got it yo
10:20 - so
10:21 - uh lost my train of thought there um
10:24 - what were you just talking about
10:25 - well uh basically so
10:29 - you need that experience to be able to
10:30 - land a job was though oh yeah
10:32 - i was pushing up god i got it yeah you
10:33 - need the experience on the job yeah so
10:35 - that's definitely true that's the
10:36 - problem that i personally ran into uh
10:38 - when i moved to los angeles i was i was
10:40 - currently a graduate student studying
10:42 - computer science and artificial
10:43 - intelligence at georgia tech like i
10:44 - mentioned earlier
10:46 - and i thought it'd be really easy to
10:47 - find a job you know i have i had my
10:48 - bachelor's degree i had my resume
10:50 - everything i had an eight month
10:51 - internship at the leading tech company
10:52 - in hawaii
10:53 - paid internship and i did some really
10:55 - cool ai computer vision stuff there
10:57 - and i thought it'd be really easy to
10:58 - find a job um
11:00 - but apparently it kind of depends on the
11:03 - company but people don't like
11:05 - considering internships as like real
11:07 - world experience for whatever reason
11:08 - so whenever i was applying to jobs like
11:10 - i literally couldn't land any i was i
11:11 - was applying i applied to 50 jobs
11:13 - literally
11:14 - and um all of them were like entry level
11:16 - positions and they're like oh you need
11:17 - this small
11:17 - amount of years to get the job this you
11:20 - need one year of experience minimum two
11:21 - years
11:22 - of experience middle which is like this
11:23 - weird uh paradox kind of
11:25 - kind of thing like chicken or the
11:26 - situation like how do you get the
11:27 - experience if you haven't had your
11:28 - entry-level job
11:29 - and it's not even unique to the coding
11:31 - industry you know i'm sure a lot of
11:32 - industries have the same problem
11:34 - um but i answered that problem i mean
11:36 - that's actually handed off on the cover
11:37 - program our team because i reached out
11:39 - to qazi i met him in person
11:40 - at a seminar once and then
11:43 - um i hit him up asking if you knew
11:45 - anybody hiring but he said i could just
11:46 - start with him
11:47 - and i ended up there and was the best
11:48 - thing that ever happened to be honest
11:50 - but
11:50 - the point i want to make is yeah there
11:52 - is an issue
11:53 - getting getting a job even with a really
11:56 - good with a
11:57 - degree and partially partially through
11:59 - my master's degree at a really really
12:01 - like one of the top 10 20 schools in the
12:02 - country um top 10 for i think number i
12:05 - think they're number eight for computer
12:06 - science in the country
12:07 - or number seven tied for number seven or
12:09 - something georgia tech at the time
12:12 - um so it was just a struggle and i kind
12:15 - of realized yeah like if you have the
12:16 - experience you have the connections
12:17 - that's really all you need and it kind
12:18 - of just goes back into like sales and
12:20 - business principles of hey
12:21 - how do you land this job um or how do
12:24 - you how do you start freelancing as long
12:26 - as you can get the job done
12:27 - you can get your foot in the door and
12:28 - really sell yourself then
12:30 - that's really all you need like do you
12:31 - do you feel like your degree was worth
12:33 - it
12:33 - like how much like do you completely
12:34 - regret it or uh if you could go back in
12:37 - time would you have not have done it and
12:38 - like tried to pursue something sooner
12:42 - so uh i like to answer that question in
12:46 - this way and
12:47 - here's here's a reality if i look at
12:49 - what i'm currently doing right now
12:52 - i could probably pick out of my
12:53 - four-year degree i could probably think
12:56 - and pick about less than a handful of
12:58 - classes that are strictly applicable to
13:01 - what i'm doing yes yes now
13:02 - yes yes that's because computers that
13:05 - were worth it and a handful professors
13:07 - that were not worth it
13:08 - that that yeah i had lots of those
13:10 - professors and those professors that
13:11 - they just showed up oh
13:13 - everyone has this professor they just
13:14 - show up they have their powerpoint there
13:17 - they turn it on and they just start
13:18 - reading it to you
13:20 - it's like yeah like it's all there and
13:21 - you have to go out there and learn by
13:23 - yourself
13:24 - yeah figure all that [ __ ] out to be like
13:26 - oh my god what do i have to do so yes
13:28 - those professors are out there but then
13:29 - there's the ones that also are willing
13:31 - to put in
13:32 - that time for you right so if you do
13:34 - happen to go to like that university
13:36 - like stanford the mit
13:37 - you're going to find those professors
13:40 - that are not only
13:41 - super knowledgeable they're like
13:42 - geniuses but they're also
13:44 - really good at teaching now if you
13:46 - happen to go to a school
13:47 - like that i went to which you know isn't
13:49 - that huge or that prestigious or maybe i
13:52 - don't know if you have this experience
13:53 - in hawaii erin
13:54 - but then there's just gonna be some
13:55 - professors that they're just there to
13:57 - do their thing and they're not great
13:59 - teachers right so then
14:01 - that that teaching principle doesn't
14:02 - come like it doesn't translate over so
14:04 - well and then it's like oh man well kind
14:06 - of sucks for me because
14:07 - now i don't feel like putting in the
14:08 - effort when i didn't see the professor
14:11 - putting in the effort as well yeah and
14:13 - this is actually an interesting thing
14:14 - about
14:14 - kazi i want to mention um if anybody who
14:16 - doesn't know kazzy's story i mean
14:17 - everybody should know kazi who's
14:18 - watching this channel but
14:20 - uh who's that yeah what the [ __ ]
14:23 - cosby where is that boy um
14:27 - no but qazi he was before he started the
14:29 - clever programmer channel
14:30 - um he was actually at school for
14:32 - computer science and he was taking
14:33 - classes from his professors but he
14:35 - actually started freelancing himself and
14:37 - was able to land a 20 uh 20 000
14:39 - contract with uh some company so
14:42 - i don't know some plumbing company or
14:44 - freaking electric company i don't know
14:46 - something along those lines he was
14:47 - coding some system up for the company to
14:49 - like manage some stuff
14:50 - uh something like that and and after a
14:53 - bit he was making a lot more money
14:54 - uh he was learning from his professors
14:56 - but at some point he was he started to
14:57 - make more money than his professors
14:59 - and his professor started asking him for
15:00 - tips on how to
15:02 - uh like what he was doing so like he
15:04 - noticed that he was like wait a minute
15:05 - my professor is asking me to teach him
15:07 - stuff like what is going on and he ended
15:09 - up dropping out
15:11 - um you have some of those uh some of
15:13 - those professors and then sometimes you
15:14 - can kind of transcend them but then of
15:15 - course
15:16 - there's really great pressures like
15:17 - georgia tech like literally every
15:18 - professor i had there was just amazing
15:20 - the content and the the the amount of
15:23 - intelligence at that level of school is
15:24 - just phenomenal like it's the world's
15:26 - best you know when you go to like one of
15:27 - the world's best schools
15:28 - uh in the usa or like if you're like at
15:30 - oxford or something in the uk or
15:31 - whatever other countries like waterloo
15:33 - canada
15:34 - there's like good colleges all over the
15:35 - world like you'll usually have really
15:37 - good professors and you'll learn a lot
15:38 - but it's not
15:39 - always applicable to what you actually
15:40 - want to do which is what daniel said
15:42 - earlier
15:43 - right so exactly so
15:46 - you could start to develop those things
15:48 - that you want to do by
15:50 - exploring with your own personal
15:51 - projects so i mentioned before
15:53 - i start to get into mobile development
15:55 - why because aaron i don't remember but
15:57 - do you ever remember the game flappy
15:58 - bird
15:59 - oh hell yeah of course i played the hell
16:00 - out of there i was playing
16:02 - i literally if anybody who doesn't know
16:04 - what that is let me pull it up really
16:05 - quick so uh
16:09 - you guys remember flappy bird oh can you
16:10 - play it can you play it on
16:12 - on browser maybe i can put the computer
16:14 - yeah i don't know it says there's a oh
16:15 - right here
16:16 - oh okay so this let me change my screen
16:19 - there we go so here so here's okay
16:23 - so um what happens is when you have to
16:25 - click and you jump right
16:26 - is this is what you're talking about
16:27 - right yeah it was a mobile that's it
16:29 - that's all you have to do and you're
16:30 - just gonna
16:30 - get bounce okay okay so uh i need to
16:34 - story out guys okay okay let me go
16:37 - this is us this is the hardest easiest
16:40 - game
16:40 - you're ever ever gonna come across okay
16:43 - and it literally took
16:44 - the world by storm everyone was posting
16:47 - just videos playing flappy bird
16:49 - everyone's posting their highest scores
16:50 - i'm just gonna
16:51 - this game just went yeah keep playing
16:53 - man this game
16:54 - went completely viral now i'm gonna be
16:56 - honest i was a little money hungry and
16:58 - i was still in college so i was like man
17:00 - how much is this developer making
17:01 - turns out i think he was making like 50
17:03 - 000 a day or something like that and i
17:05 - was like dude 50k
17:06 - a day this is yeah i heard about that
17:08 - like if you have a viral app
17:10 - like you can make a crap money it's just
17:12 - a matter of getting it to go viral
17:13 - like now now here's the thing you know
17:16 - now
17:17 - yeah the mobile market has gotten like
17:20 - crazy saturated because people saw that
17:22 - opportunity so a lot of people went
17:24 - there i'm just embarrassing myself but
17:26 - like i can't even pass the first one
17:30 - but but like i just simply remember
17:32 - playing this in my physics 2 class
17:34 - i'm like screw this like i want to
17:36 - become a mobile app developer so what i
17:38 - started to do was i start to research
17:40 - hey
17:40 - how can i build an app for the android
17:42 - how can i build
17:44 - an app for ios and i started to learn at
17:46 - swift i learned along with xcode and i
17:48 - learned java and the android studio and
17:50 - i was able to start to build these
17:51 - applications and i was like you know
17:52 - i'll take this a step further this is
17:53 - where my externship came out
17:55 - i reached out to a local company like
17:57 - here i am this college kid
17:58 - all the experience i have is for my
18:00 - school i reach out to a local company
18:02 - who's android development i'm like hey
18:03 - guys like well first i try to apply for
18:05 - a job but then i'm like no you know what
18:07 - you're too new you had no experience
18:08 - totally fine i understand that right
18:10 - that's that's the chicken and the x and
18:11 - there you're talking about right
18:12 - they want every college grad to have
18:14 - five years of experience
18:15 - when they haven't even been in college
18:17 - for five years yeah like this so
18:20 - silly exactly so i was like okay well
18:21 - let's do this what if
18:23 - you can hand me off a project that is
18:26 - not priority
18:27 - that no one is working on that you guys
18:28 - want to work on for the future
18:30 - and i could just start messing around
18:32 - with that let me just dabble in there
18:33 - see what i can do and see if i could
18:35 - make something cool for you guys so they
18:36 - had an idea of an android application
18:38 - they wanted to have but they didn't have
18:39 - the resources
18:40 - so they handed it off to me so i would
18:42 - show up like i'm still in school
18:44 - i'm working part time and i'm sure like
18:46 - my only off day was friday i'm giving up
18:48 - my entire damn
18:49 - friday to show up to this office and
18:51 - just mess around
18:52 - with android development like that's the
18:55 - level of commitment that i had
18:57 - to developing the skill sets that i
18:58 - needed and it wasn't even that thinking
19:00 - in terms of a job i was just having fun
19:02 - i know a lot of you guys here in the
19:03 - stream have fun going through these
19:05 - projects that you know like all these
19:07 - live
19:08 - uh codings that that clever programmers
19:10 - putting out there's so much fun they're
19:11 - super amazing when sunny with knobs when
19:13 - kazi hop on
19:14 - that was the type of fun i was having i
19:16 - was willing to give up
19:18 - my fridays for that but because i was
19:20 - developing that skill set
19:22 - that was a secondary consequence now i
19:24 - was able to actually develop a skill set
19:26 - alongside with that but again
19:28 - that goes based off what i always say
19:30 - that is priority building more projects
19:32 - and if you could build and find projects
19:34 - that you're excited about
19:35 - then you're just gonna it's like this
19:37 - upward spiral you're excited about it
19:39 - you're learning more
19:40 - you're having fun and then you're
19:42 - getting more experience and just keep
19:43 - going up and up the feedback cycle just
19:45 - all the positive reinforcement
19:47 - yeah and then you end up a blue origin
19:49 - right and now you're putting us on
19:50 - on mars is that what's happening oh
19:53 - we're putting you guys in space it's
19:54 - better than mars
19:55 - because mars is limited yeah are you oh
19:58 - i mean i guess we
19:59 - are you guys trying to go to the moon
20:00 - like what is blue origin's overall goal
20:02 - right now i don't unders i
20:03 - didn't actually dive into them too much
20:05 - is a side tangent yeah for sure so
20:06 - if you go to blurring's website our big
20:09 - mission is
20:10 - filling with people living and working
20:11 - in space living and working right space
20:14 - so just end this exactly okay cool
20:17 - well literally in space not in planets
20:19 - because
20:20 - you know space space is unlimited versus
20:23 - planets being limited
20:24 - if we were able to somehow populate mars
20:28 - we'd probably only be able to double in
20:29 - size because mars is still a planet
20:32 - but if we're able to populate space at
20:34 - that point it's
20:35 - literally unlimited oh [ __ ] you mean
20:37 - creating like huge space stations
20:39 - just like yeah like like have you seen
20:41 - them look up o'neill colonies
20:43 - look up o'neill colonies oh neil
20:52 - was actually inspired from fictional
20:54 - writing right of like people and this
20:56 - utopia
20:57 - in space the o'neill cylinder right but
20:59 - you can just look at the images
21:00 - okay so basically this big cylinder
21:03 - that's rotating at the perfect speed to
21:05 - imitate gravity
21:07 - and then you just have this environment
21:08 - where you're able to actually
21:10 - create like a simulate a different world
21:12 - so like a right
21:13 - half and halo right yeah
21:16 - exactly like a halo it's just like
21:17 - another place you could live in space
21:20 - and if you can create that at that point
21:22 - it's like
21:23 - dude you can expand and grow as big as
21:25 - you want you don't have to worry about
21:27 - like hey you know if we plan if we call
21:28 - nate mars weapons will
21:30 - run out of space in mars like here in
21:32 - earth or resources or whatever that may
21:33 - be
21:34 - long term yeah because like getting to a
21:35 - different solar system is like that's
21:36 - like another beast in its own
21:38 - i see dude that's cool i was just
21:40 - curious i don't want to get too off
21:41 - topic on this topic but
21:43 - uh awesome so uh le going backtracking a
21:46 - little bit
21:47 - so you said um
21:50 - i was leading do you remember what i
21:51 - asked you uh before i went on this thing
21:54 - we were talking about
21:56 - i might have do you remember i think
21:57 - we're talk dude it might have been we're
21:59 - talking if college was
22:01 - worth it then we started talking about
22:03 - and then we started talking about
22:04 - you know how the experience plays uh so
22:07 - that's when
22:08 - the flappy bird because i learned
22:09 - android development because i was
22:10 - obsessed
22:11 - with flappy bird that's why i was like i
22:13 - need to learn how to program
22:14 - applications i could be rich
22:15 - now unfortunately that wasn't my path
22:17 - but i had a lot of fun
22:19 - learning how to develop mobile
22:20 - applications yeah yeah
22:23 - okay so
22:26 - um i guess to answer this question
22:28 - directly
22:29 - uh let's kind of dissect a little bit
22:30 - we've been we've kind of just been
22:31 - chatting for a bit about
22:33 - um college versus not uh but put it very
22:35 - clearly what is your opinion on
22:38 - having like like what scenario is
22:41 - college
22:42 - like the right decision and what
22:43 - scenario is college the wrong decision
22:45 - versus like um you know being
22:47 - self-taught or doing a coding boot camp
22:48 - or even taking a course from
22:49 - people like us you know um learning how
22:51 - to code i think
22:53 - i i think if i were if i were my own
22:56 - shoes back in the
22:57 - in back in the i was going to say back
22:58 - in the future back in the past
23:00 - these would be the two things that would
23:03 - dictate to me whether i want to go to
23:05 - college or not one
23:07 - is my finances okay so with my specific
23:10 - college
23:11 - is yeah huge my specific college case
23:14 - i was in the same city where i grew up
23:17 - so i was able to live
23:18 - in my house and i had scholarships
23:20 - enough that my first two years of
23:22 - college
23:23 - i was actually getting a 500 paycheck
23:25 - from school plus everything was already
23:27 - paid off
23:27 - and i had a job so during college i was
23:30 - in the financial situation
23:31 - where i finished college like with money
23:34 - in my bank right and not a lot of people
23:36 - have that fortunate situation
23:38 - so if you have to go twenty thousand
23:40 - dollars into debt and that was a
23:42 - decision i made i could have gone to ut
23:44 - it's a better known college but i would
23:45 - have to take a loan i didn't have a
23:47 - scholarship
23:47 - i would put myself 80 000 in debt and i
23:50 - was not willing
23:51 - to do that didn't matter what the hell i
23:52 - was gonna do graduating i was not
23:54 - willing to do that
23:55 - yeah it's hard like even if you land a
23:56 - six-figure job at a good company it's
23:58 - gonna take you
23:59 - like two to five years to pay it off
24:01 - depending where you're living because a
24:01 - lot of the high-paying jobs too like if
24:03 - you're in san fran
24:04 - 100k isn't that much because you're
24:06 - living in the san fran where the living
24:07 - expenses is just
24:09 - super high so you're only saving so much
24:11 - a year um so that student debt is nasty
24:13 - so that's one big thing if you're going
24:14 - to go into student debt
24:15 - i feel like college is almost never
24:17 - worth it in my opinion
24:19 - uh i mean there's a bunch of different
24:20 - point of views online like here let me
24:21 - change my desktop so i did a search here
24:23 - on google earlier it says is college
24:24 - worth it for programmers
24:25 - so the first thing that pops up is
24:27 - degree probably not worth it
24:28 - unless you are not self-confident enough
24:30 - to get hired without one so
24:32 - uh software engineering that's
24:33 - dockychange.com i don't even know who
24:34 - this is but this is the first thing that
24:36 - popped up
24:37 - can i add something to that because
24:38 - that's close to my second answer
24:40 - yeah so my second answer comes down to
24:43 - self-awareness
24:44 - okay now what i mean by that is you i
24:47 - would have to know myself
24:48 - and my past and how basically what he
24:51 - says how confident i am in my ability
24:53 - to teach myself and pay to surround
24:56 - myself with the right people
24:58 - or whether you know and i started to pay
25:00 - and strong myself with the right people
25:01 - or with
25:02 - people who could level me up whether it
25:03 - was through college or through like some
25:05 - sort of programming community right but
25:07 - i just had to have that self that level
25:09 - of self-awareness
25:10 - whether hey can i really put my you know
25:13 - nose to the grindstone learn everything
25:15 - by myself
25:16 - try to involve myself with communities
25:18 - go out there network or
25:20 - is it better for me if i kind of have a
25:22 - roadmap laid out even though it might
25:23 - not be the perfect roadmap for me
25:25 - even though i might deviate from it but
25:27 - at least having that roadmap gets me
25:29 - started to build
25:30 - that confidence so i want to go back to
25:32 - the answer i think that's the second
25:33 - part which is
25:34 - having that self-awareness in your
25:36 - confidence if you constrain yourself
25:37 - with the right community
25:39 - and the right mentors whether that's
25:41 - through school or whether that's
25:43 - through a programming community like
25:44 - clever programmer then at that point you
25:46 - could build a conference in either one
25:47 - but you have to know which one
25:49 - you are going to respond better to yeah
25:51 - absolutely yeah
25:52 - whatever i feel like yeah college is
25:54 - very expensive and there
25:56 - is a lot of value in having that degree
25:58 - because from a default perspective like
26:00 - they will probably prefer somebody with
26:01 - a degree versus somebody without a
26:02 - degree if everything else is the same
26:04 - because it's kind of like a proven track
26:05 - record of oh you've done this but
26:07 - if you're going to go into debt like
26:09 - it's i don't personally don't think it's
26:10 - worth it for me i didn't i was in debt i
26:12 - paid off school as i was going through
26:13 - it because i went to an affordable
26:15 - college
26:15 - and um i had a decent job and i worked
26:18 - part-time but
26:19 - i think at the end of the day whatever
26:20 - the best in learning environment the
26:21 - best
26:22 - learning and networking environment for
26:24 - you is good for you to achieve your
26:26 - goals that would be the best place to be
26:27 - so a lot of people in our courses here
26:29 - i clever programmer by the way if
26:31 - anybody wants to join
26:32 - um if anybody anybody wants to become a
26:35 - a javascript developer and make a living
26:37 - from it as a freelancer or eventually
26:38 - land a job at a cool company a fan
26:40 - company
26:40 - uh like like where where daniel works
26:44 - then we have a free webinar training
26:45 - down in the description you can check it
26:46 - out and it's completely free just watch
26:48 - it it gives you some value and then
26:50 - um at the end uh we we offer you to join
26:53 - the course
26:53 - if you actually want to pursue things
26:54 - further uh which is just a paid course
26:56 - you can join our community and you have
26:57 - like network of all developers and
26:59 - accountability so really cool
27:00 - um mentioning that if that's your kind
27:02 - of thing but if not
27:04 - uh totally cool too but let's get back
27:06 - to yeah i mean look like i was saying
27:08 - you have to pick your community you have
27:11 - to pick your mentors
27:12 - now the question is if it's college are
27:15 - you gonna put tens of thousands of
27:16 - dollars
27:17 - into a system that for programmers has
27:19 - been proven that
27:20 - you don't need or is it going to be in
27:22 - the community like the clever programmer
27:24 - community
27:25 - where you can learn and build projects
27:27 - like i said projects are king
27:29 - you learn to build projects through
27:30 - experience and you're able to network
27:32 - with people
27:33 - who are maybe a little level b above you
27:35 - a little level under you at the same
27:36 - level
27:37 - and you could learn from every single
27:38 - one you can help people out
27:40 - and it's just your choice who do you
27:42 - want to surround yourself with because
27:43 - everyone already knows is the most
27:45 - cliche thing but you are the average of
27:46 - your five closest people yeah right
27:48 - you're private
27:49 - and if you don't take that to heart if
27:52 - you don't take that to heart
27:53 - in five years you're gonna be in the
27:54 - exact same [ __ ] spot you're in right
27:56 - now you're gonna be in this wishful
27:57 - thinking like man
27:58 - yes i did do that where could i be my
28:01 - disappear
28:02 - because you're doing the same thing day
28:03 - in and day out but if you're on people
28:04 - who are doing ambitious things as well
28:06 - other ambitious developers other
28:07 - freelancers
28:08 - uh people like us that are working at
28:10 - companies like killer programmer or blue
28:12 - origin
28:12 - then uh you kind of you're constantly
28:14 - reminded of what's possible
28:16 - and what you can do and then you can
28:16 - kind of get out of that you can kind of
28:18 - change your trajectory
28:19 - you got a pattern interrupt you got to
28:21 - switch your way of living out of switch
28:23 - your way
28:24 - shock yourself huh exactly albert
28:26 - einstein said
28:27 - you know insanity is doing the same
28:29 - thing over and over again i think you're
28:30 - gonna get a different result yeah
28:31 - if you're not in the community and
28:33 - you're not getting results well
28:34 - you gotta go get in the community and
28:36 - then you'll start getting closer to
28:38 - getting results if not
28:39 - getting those results
28:42 - yeah so yeah very important about the
28:46 - learning environment the community that
28:47 - you're in
28:47 - um one argument for college is that
28:50 - because honestly i i met a lot of good
28:52 - professors
28:53 - i mean i i feel like 15 of professors
28:55 - were were good
28:56 - like 15 of the professors um and 15
29:00 - of the classes were good and then that
29:01 - overlap was probably like five percent
29:02 - of the classes were actually applicable
29:04 - to what i was doing
29:05 - like learning the programming basics and
29:06 - everything i probably could have done
29:07 - that on my own
29:08 - uh but a class like algorithms or
29:10 - something could be a little bit
29:10 - difficult so i feel like those classes
29:12 - were worth it
29:13 - um but other than that just i mean i
29:16 - made a lot of good friends and made some
29:17 - connections
29:17 - that's how i got my internship but i
29:19 - feel like if
29:21 - i knew about this thing like clever
29:22 - programmer um or even coding boot camps
29:24 - which were like around ten thousand
29:25 - dollars were available i might have done
29:27 - that instead
29:28 - uh just because save some money cut out
29:30 - the [ __ ] like you don't have to take
29:31 - you know political science and writing
29:33 - and all those these other things
29:35 - uh but um i just
29:38 - it really depends honestly i feel like
29:40 - college was worth it for me but not
29:42 - for my professional uh career mainly for
29:45 - the connections i built and the
29:46 - experiences i had so it was worth it in
29:47 - that aspect 100
29:49 - um but i from this business perspective
29:52 - like if like if you're more business
29:53 - oriented and you want a freelance or you
29:55 - want to do something cool or start a
29:56 - startup
29:57 - then you really don't need anything at
29:58 - all you just got to have the drive you
29:59 - got to have the right people around you
30:01 - like daniel said
30:01 - you got to have the vision and the
30:02 - belief and the confidence to just go for
30:05 - it you can learn
30:06 - things on your own um like do do do
30:08 - problems on hacker rank you know and and
30:10 - just get good and just land a
30:12 - lot of job like does google like did
30:13 - google look at your resume how did you
30:15 - land that interview with google
30:16 - and then get the job offer too uh with
30:19 - google i think i just sent in my resume
30:21 - it passed the filtering process and then
30:23 - we just went into the interview process
30:25 - so i had to do my phone interview i had
30:27 - to do my
30:28 - virtual technical interview then i had
30:30 - to do my on-site technical interview
30:32 - after that
30:32 - and then similar thing for microsoft
30:34 - microsoft actually came to the campus
30:36 - i did a campus interview then it was
30:39 - good enough to take me on for the
30:40 - on-site interview and i did that on-site
30:42 - interview and
30:44 - that's what i ended up doing for those
30:45 - two but so i guess i just want to take
30:47 - it back a little bit but
30:48 - you know you asked me that questions
30:50 - like hey is was it worth it for me would
30:52 - i do it again
30:53 - i would do college again because again
30:55 - of those two specific situations
30:56 - financially
30:57 - i ended up making money from college
30:59 - right
31:00 - and second self-awareness i knew that i
31:02 - wasn't in that spot just yet
31:04 - where i was confident in my ability to
31:06 - learn by myself so i kind of needed that
31:08 - road map
31:08 - but i would do college completely
31:11 - different if i was able to go back and
31:13 - do it right like
31:14 - on my side yeah during my history
31:16 - classes i'd be programming
31:17 - right yes yes finishing your coding
31:20 - project application yeah where you're
31:21 - learning about political science like
31:22 - that was back in the days when trump was
31:24 - i'd be making flappy birds
31:27 - bro i'm terrible at that game man my
31:30 - score was everyone was i don't do i
31:31 - think there was a single
31:32 - i never met a single good if you have a
31:35 - score higher than
31:37 - 50 on flappy bird and you have a
31:38 - screenshot from the past you better like
31:40 - put it on youtube or something i want to
31:41 - see that
31:42 - share it let me see if there's any
31:43 - questions by the way in the comments uh
31:46 - yeah let's do it boss yeah um
31:49 - i mean these aren't really they're
31:51 - asking like to limit questions
31:53 - google dumped angular is that true did
31:55 - google dump angular
31:58 - mr younabe i don't know if that's that's
32:01 - true or not
32:04 - all right guys do this right now if you
32:06 - have a question about college if you
32:08 - have a question about developing
32:10 - your career by the path go ahead and
32:12 - drop some questions down there so that
32:14 - we can answer them because again
32:15 - like i i feel this is so much value
32:17 - because this is literally our chance
32:19 - to mentor you guys virtual yeah yeah
32:23 - this is our chance to literally mentor
32:26 - you we can pick up your question right
32:28 - now
32:28 - we can tell you hey from aaron's
32:29 - experience from my experience what would
32:31 - we do in that case
32:33 - and now like literally you could go
32:35 - forward and do whatever it is that you
32:36 - you need to do next so guys this is a
32:38 - super opportunity this is an opportunity
32:40 - that
32:41 - you know you can also have inside of the
32:43 - community if you happen to come across
32:45 - us and reach out to us but again take
32:48 - advantage of it
32:49 - if not then we'll just keep playing
32:51 - flappy bird
32:52 - no i'm not gonna play flappy bird i have
32:54 - to keep an eye on the chat to see if
32:55 - there's any questions
32:56 - um i don't take the use so somebody says
32:59 - he doesn't take the useless classes
33:01 - in college um
33:04 - i mean that's that's true another good
33:07 - question is how to get experience in
33:08 - college so those two questions so i
33:09 - don't take
33:10 - the useless classes uh i mean some it
33:12 - depends on the college you go to i know
33:13 - a lot of like more modern colleges that
33:15 - got approved for their curriculum
33:16 - um they can kind of get away with
33:18 - bending things and but usually for most
33:20 - colleges you're required to
33:21 - let me change the camera here back to us
33:23 - you're usually required to
33:25 - um take like political science and
33:27 - history and stuff right like you have to
33:28 - and then you kind of like front load all
33:30 - your your major classes you have to
33:31 - major in something in college
33:33 - um but i mean you can only do that to an
33:34 - extent right
33:36 - uh so i feel like yeah that is useful
33:39 - but i mean you are going to bring a lot
33:40 - of time it's just
33:41 - you kind of see the other value of being
33:43 - in college if you really want to do it
33:44 - uh another question though is how to
33:47 - gain experience in college so i'm gonna
33:49 - take that as
33:50 - like real world experience like why are
33:52 - you doing it and i mean first thing for
33:53 - me is like maybe just land a part-time
33:55 - job at a small company or a paid
33:56 - internship or something uh the
33:57 - internship for me didn't work out for
33:59 - some reason people didn't care about it
34:00 - they wanted like actual experience like
34:01 - a real job even though i was getting
34:03 - paid
34:03 - at a real company doing real work i was
34:05 - confused about that distinction there
34:07 - but i would just i would probably just
34:09 - try to find a job like right away you
34:10 - know like user connection
34:12 - connections with your professors or
34:13 - something like that do a summer summer
34:15 - job or something like that
34:16 - um i didn't personally do it did you did
34:18 - you have any experience
34:20 - and you did you said you mentioned your
34:21 - externship yeah so so i mean
34:23 - like i was wanting to do whatever the
34:25 - [ __ ] i had to do to get a job
34:27 - so i said yeah i'm gonna give up my
34:28 - fridays i'm gonna work for free so that
34:30 - i can learn this and i can get the job
34:32 - and i can start to get that experience
34:34 - so if you
34:35 - happen to be oh man no one's hiring me
34:37 - i'm sending out my applications
34:39 - well [ __ ] work for free you're not
34:40 - worth anything yet if you're not getting
34:41 - hired you're not worth anything yet
34:43 - you haven't proven yourself you haven't
34:45 - gotten that experience so be willing to
34:47 - put yourself
34:48 - up for free work learn get that
34:51 - experience
34:52 - right don't do it for the money do it
34:54 - because you like it do it because you
34:55 - want to learn more
34:56 - do it because you want to grow more when
34:58 - you actually become worth something
35:00 - that's when you're going to get paid big
35:01 - dollars yeah definitely and
35:04 - me personally i had my internship in the
35:06 - very last semester of my college so my
35:08 - eighth semester before i graduated i
35:10 - took four years in my undergrad
35:11 - and i thought it would um
35:16 - i thought it would have been more
35:18 - beneficial if i actually landed an
35:19 - internship much earlier on
35:20 - in my programming career so honestly a
35:23 - lot of my early classes were kind of bad
35:24 - at my undergrad school and i couldn't
35:26 - really grasp the concepts that easily i
35:28 - feel like went to a better school
35:29 - actually would have been much better
35:30 - and i could have landed something but if
35:32 - you could land an internship like a
35:33 - summer internship in your first summer
35:34 - of college that'd be great like for free
35:36 - like
35:36 - like you're like like unpaid like daniel
35:39 - said just get the experience you're not
35:40 - worth anything prove that to yourself
35:41 - it might be painful but if you're doing
35:42 - it for free then hey it's good
35:44 - hop on your resume and then the next
35:46 - summer maybe try to get a paid
35:48 - internship in the third summer maybe try
35:49 - to get a part-time job and actually get
35:51 - some real experience and then do
35:52 - part-time
35:53 - work and part-time school until you
35:55 - finish your degree but
35:56 - if you can actually get some experience
35:57 - and degree in tandem i feel like that's
35:59 - actually
36:00 - um good again i mean how do you land
36:03 - that part-time job to begin with because
36:04 - you need experience to get that job so
36:07 - chicken or the egg it's a struggle but i
36:09 - mean if you maximize your networking and
36:11 - everything then you eventually find
36:12 - something i mean that's how i met causie
36:14 - and
36:15 - connections are very surprising so ask
36:16 - your professors if you're in college
36:18 - um if they have any and like i said you
36:21 - can always also be working
36:23 - on your own projects on the side
36:25 - something you're passionate about
36:26 - something that you want to learn
36:27 - something absolutely we didn't even
36:29 - mention that like portfolios and
36:30 - projects
36:31 - but didn't mean to interrupt you always
36:32 - go on yeah no no perfect perfect point
36:34 - like right now i'm coaching my friend
36:36 - so that basically he he was like an
36:37 - economics major right now he's doing
36:39 - data analysis for a company he's like
36:40 - hey i want to be a programmer
36:42 - like if you go to his github literally
36:43 - his very first line of code was
36:45 - committed in february
36:46 - as of right now as of august he is this
36:49 - close to landing his first programmer
36:51 - developer job
36:52 - how was he able to do that he put in the
36:54 - work for those seven months
36:56 - after his 40-hour work week he was
36:58 - getting straight to programming and he
37:00 - was enjoying it
37:00 - he hired another mentor he had two
37:02 - people you know when the industry
37:04 - another mentor has helped people through
37:05 - that transition
37:06 - and he's learning as much as he can he's
37:08 - applying as much as he can
37:09 - and he's doing it towards building
37:10 - projects building projects and i
37:12 - guarantee you
37:13 - he's going to get the first job and it's
37:15 - going to be paid
37:16 - because of the experience he got from
37:18 - just building projects so here's the
37:20 - thing
37:20 - if you also take that route where you
37:21 - want to build projects and get the
37:23 - experience
37:24 - it's not this one project that's going
37:26 - to make it like oh man
37:27 - this whole project didn't give me my job
37:29 - no you better build like 10 [ __ ]
37:31 - projects
37:32 - out of those 10 projects maybe one or
37:34 - two are going to be good
37:35 - those are the ones you put on your
37:36 - resume not not like oh i built two
37:38 - projects can i get a job now
37:39 - no [ __ ] you better be putting in
37:42 - the time
37:42 - yeah to build out project after project
37:45 - after project
37:46 - to really learn what you have to do to
37:48 - build those experiences and how those
37:49 - shitty projects are going to have just
37:51 - a couple are going to be worth showing
37:53 - yeah definitely you want to showcase
37:54 - with your best foot forward and make
37:55 - sure you do enough of the work to get
37:57 - there it's like it's like anything you
37:58 - know working out you got to you got to
37:59 - do enough work to get the results so
38:01 - if you're serious about something like
38:02 - put in the effort so definitely build a
38:04 - lot build portfolios
38:06 - and portfolio is useful if you want to
38:07 - freelance or or get a job it doesn't
38:10 - matter
38:10 - uh hey you're you're coming out of focus
38:12 - bro a little bit um
38:13 - but um what was it saying
38:18 - best foot forward yeah best foot forward
38:21 - uh and you just want to get things on
38:22 - your portfolio
38:23 - so you can really just um yeah just put
38:27 - your best foot forward
38:28 - i think that was the whole point i was
38:29 - wrapping up there it's yeah perfect it's
38:31 - perfect
38:32 - yeah like if the if the program i mean
38:34 - if the if the applications you built are
38:36 - kind of relevant to what you're doing
38:37 - too then that's a big bonus it's like
38:38 - hey i've done this before
38:39 - uh even if you don't have different work
38:41 - experience if you can get through the
38:42 - through the interview and kind of just
38:43 - showcase and really show them that
38:44 - you'll be a good fit for the position
38:46 - and speak to them clearly and show them
38:47 - what you've done then you have a good
38:49 - chance of landing a job
38:50 - so um let me see if there's any other
38:54 - questions you have anything to add to
38:55 - that daniel
38:56 - yeah portfolio man i mean i also did not
38:59 - have a portfolio
39:00 - i had a resume but i'm telling like the
39:02 - thing i told my friend is like yo we
39:03 - need to build that portfolio because a
39:04 - portfolio is look
39:06 - when they're hiring you they're not
39:07 - hiring a developer they're hiring a
39:08 - person
39:09 - okay yeah yeah you're not hiring a
39:10 - developer they're hanging a person
39:11 - that's something you also have to
39:12 - understand when you go into the hiring
39:13 - process
39:14 - but let's look at the other way so what
39:15 - you have to understand is they're not
39:17 - looking for projects
39:18 - they're looking for a human that is
39:20 - going to be compatible
39:21 - to the skill sets and the soft skills
39:24 - the soft
39:24 - uh the soft people communication skills
39:26 - that they need to fill the role
39:28 - so portfolio is a great way to
39:30 - communicate that because you can put
39:32 - literally you can put your personality
39:34 - on
39:35 - a web page which is insane like a resume
39:37 - you can't put your personality like
39:39 - you can't the only thing you could write
39:40 - about is [ __ ] that you've done like hey
39:42 - i worked as this and i did that
39:43 - experience or whatever in your portfolio
39:45 - in your website
39:47 - you can pull your personality you can
39:48 - make like a little blog you could post
39:50 - content you could document
39:52 - what you've been doing you could
39:53 - document like man worked on this project
39:54 - i struggled a lot you share
39:56 - a story you share your struggle and
39:58 - people are able to see
39:59 - your transformation they're able to see
40:01 - your specific journey and you build out
40:03 - a portfolio
40:04 - in that manner when you show it to
40:06 - someone they see that human
40:07 - characteristic of you
40:08 - and it's not just a resume it's not just
40:10 - all these papers are coming across your
40:11 - desk
40:12 - and your coding style too they can see
40:13 - like if you comment code right and all
40:15 - that stuff
40:17 - exactly now someone sees it they
40:20 - understand
40:20 - if you're gonna be a good fit for what
40:22 - it is they're looking for because it's
40:24 - not just
40:24 - words on the paper yeah you're not just
40:27 - another yeah paper in the stack you know
40:29 - you can stand a little more with your
40:30 - portfolio i mean the one
40:32 - one counter argument to that is a lot of
40:34 - a lot of people do have portfolios
40:35 - you're competing with all them
40:36 - which but it just goes back to you gotta
40:40 - you gotta have your stuff together and
40:41 - get some good projects on your portfolio
40:43 - that's why we're so project based here
40:44 - at cleverprogrammer like we love
40:45 - building
40:46 - all these clones on youtube and in our
40:47 - in our paid courses and programs and
40:49 - mentoring and coaching we teach a lot of
40:51 - project-based
40:52 - uh things everything is project-based so
40:53 - you're building um
40:55 - you're building portfolios basically
40:56 - that's what you're doing when you're
40:57 - going over courses
40:58 - um or going going through our youtube
41:01 - content so all these are great things
41:02 - people have landed people have already
41:03 - landed jobs just by going through our
41:05 - free coding
41:06 - um clones um oh you're you're uh
41:10 - yeah yeah i just keep switching it
41:11 - because my camera is messing up my bad
41:13 - brother
41:13 - all good but yeah so we actually have
41:15 - people landing like 90k 96k 100k 110k
41:18 - jobs and contracts just by doing some of
41:21 - the apps that we built up together and
41:23 - just popping on our portfolio and
41:24 - showcasing putting their best foot
41:25 - forward it's like hey
41:26 - this person built a covent tracker this
41:27 - person built a instagram clone a netflix
41:29 - clone a hula clone and amazon clone
41:31 - and um if people see that and they're
41:34 - really impressed by and they want a
41:35 - friend of developer that usually is
41:37 - has a big wow factor and apparently it's
41:39 - been working for people so
41:41 - uh definitely definitely do that i think
41:42 - portfolio is honestly stronger than a
41:44 - resume because
41:45 - at the end of the freaking day they want
41:47 - you to be able to
41:48 - code up whatever they need to be done of
41:49 - course they're hiring a person so don't
41:51 - be a weirdo
41:52 - but if you're a decent person you fit in
41:54 - and then you also have the skill set and
41:55 - you've proven that through portfolio
41:57 - then
41:57 - you have a really good chance of landing
41:59 - whatever job is in front of you
42:00 - regardless of college you're not so
42:02 - um oh did you when you
42:06 - you had offers at google and microsoft
42:07 - and blue origin
42:09 - was it just those three nothing else
42:10 - though those are the only three i
42:12 - applied to and i ended up getting them
42:14 - so i was like
42:14 - damn like at first i was like like you
42:16 - apply but now looking back i was like
42:17 - dude i should have applied everywhere
42:18 - man because
42:19 - it's cool when they fly you out they pay
42:20 - for everything so it's like dude i could
42:21 - have gone
42:22 - all over the world dang man
42:25 - that's that's cool i kind of wish i went
42:27 - down that route a little bit but i just
42:28 - kind of jumped on clever program right
42:30 - away i guess
42:30 - i went down the startup route very very
42:32 - fast um
42:34 - with qazi here building the the brand a
42:37 - little bit more over the past two years
42:38 - but um i feel like we've hit most of the
42:42 - the the point what were you gonna say
42:46 - yeah i mean i mean in the end it's
42:49 - there's gonna be so many things that
42:51 - would be nice
42:52 - that we could do right but one of the
42:54 - biggest things that
42:55 - i think i learned from from warren buffy
42:58 - he's like look this is what you guys
42:59 - gotta get a paper happy birthday warren
43:00 - buffett oh it is turned into 90.
43:02 - this is turned 90 today for warren
43:04 - buffett baby this is for one buck
43:08 - that's hilarious but basically says okay
43:10 - 90.
43:11 - this 90 year old this 90 year old
43:13 - billionaire said this
43:14 - he's like get a sheet of paper and write
43:16 - out 25 things
43:18 - that you want to do with your life right
43:21 - like these 25 things that
43:23 - that you know in the end you want to
43:24 - accomplish you want to be able to do
43:25 - whatever that may be
43:27 - and then what you need to do next is you
43:29 - need to scratch out
43:30 - 20 of those and the five that you
43:33 - haven't scratched out those are the
43:34 - things you're going to focus on
43:36 - yeah and the principle behind that is
43:38 - you have to understand
43:39 - that in life there's going to be so many
43:41 - things you could do what if like right
43:42 - now you might be doing software
43:44 - like man what if instead of software i
43:46 - don't know i did some
43:47 - instagram modeling instagram modeling is
43:49 - the thing now you know like
43:51 - what if i did something else right so
43:52 - there's gonna be so many things
43:53 - distracting you
43:54 - right but you have to focus on those
43:58 - five things that you're gonna prioritize
43:59 - because maybe instagram modeling was
44:01 - like number 10
44:01 - but it's off your list now and you have
44:03 - to focus on that top one which is
44:04 - software becoming the developer that you
44:06 - want to become
44:07 - whether it's a freelancer whether that's
44:08 - getting a job with the big tech company
44:10 - with the startup
44:11 - whatever that may be because
44:13 - fundamentally when you start to focus
44:15 - that's when you actually start to get
44:17 - clear by your goals and make
44:18 - progress in the direction that you want
44:21 - to go
44:23 - absolutely absolutely daniel thank you
44:25 - so much value provided
44:27 - thank you for having me on this call i
44:28 - was i was proud to just like answer
44:29 - questions go over myself but
44:31 - daniel hopped on last minute he works
44:32 - with us by the way clever programmer i
44:33 - don't think he's ever been on a stream
44:34 - before so this might be a new face but
44:36 - killer guy killer programmer um very
44:39 - interesting story but
44:41 - uh last thing we should start probably
44:42 - wrapping up in the next few minutes here
44:44 - uh one question that i want to say is
44:46 - somebody was saying how do you get
44:48 - started with a with an entry-level
44:50 - portfolio as
44:50 - a programmer so uh just to clearly
44:53 - answer that question
44:54 - just start coding projects man like
44:56 - start coding some of the stuff on
44:57 - youtube channel join our our paid
44:58 - courses
44:59 - start building those in the portfolio
45:00 - and just build things that you're
45:02 - passionate about and excited about
45:03 - because that's the best way to get
45:04 - started
45:04 - you have to be excited at the beginning
45:06 - and eventually what the habit's built
45:07 - sometimes it gets kind of rough but you
45:08 - can keep doing it because you have the
45:09 - habit but at the beginning
45:10 - just build cool projects and upload it
45:13 - to your github
45:13 - and just have it in a presentable way
45:15 - and just build a huge
45:17 - portfolio that's why it's called a
45:18 - portfolio like just start with a random
45:20 - clone if you can't pick one here i'm
45:21 - going to tell you what
45:22 - go uh go build the netflix club go find
45:25 - it i think sunny and kazzy code it up
45:27 - it's a
45:27 - great app just go code it up and put
45:29 - that on your portfolio so go do that
45:30 - like literally right after this video if
45:32 - you don't have a portfolio
45:33 - and you're a completely beginner coder
45:35 - um i mean if you're a complete beginner
45:36 - coder i think you need to know
45:37 - javascript
45:38 - uh to actually go to that video but if
45:41 - you know javascript basics if you've
45:42 - been watching this for a while just go
45:44 - do that and get that on your portfolio
45:45 - like right now go from beginning to end
45:47 - okay yeah and i want to add that real
45:50 - quick
45:50 - what i told my friend who's
45:51 - transitioning right in those seven
45:53 - months
45:53 - he's built out like eight or nine
45:55 - projects right now let me tell you
45:57 - those first seven are really crappy
45:59 - projects they're really beginner
46:01 - projects
46:01 - like the first one was literally like a
46:03 - hello world he has an alarm clock when
46:05 - you go to a page
46:06 - that's ticking like he was just learning
46:08 - basic javascript
46:09 - he has that in his github but that's not
46:12 - necessarily showcasing his portfolio
46:13 - right
46:14 - he later did like a simple rock paper
46:16 - scissors stuff he has that on github
46:18 - because he's documenting his journey but
46:20 - he doesn't necessarily have that
46:22 - on his portfolio now he got to the point
46:24 - where he has this complicated
46:26 - to do application right it's like a to
46:28 - do application you can add things
46:30 - prioritize things
46:31 - you could put time around things like
46:32 - it's this awesome application that he
46:34 - did
46:35 - right and whether he starts to get
46:37 - creative with it he starts to add a
46:38 - bunch of things
46:39 - now that's also on github so you can see
46:41 - his documentation
46:42 - but that's part of the portfolio because
46:44 - like i said you need to build out 10
46:45 - projects and
46:46 - 10 of them you know seven eight are
46:48 - probably gonna suck
46:49 - and then two of them are gonna be really
46:50 - good right yeah yeah that's how it is
46:52 - the other thing is
46:53 - when you're building out those projects
46:55 - if you're going and you're following
46:56 - sunny or your knowledge or whoever's
46:57 - doing them
46:58 - make sure you understand what the [ __ ]
47:00 - you're building because if you put that
47:01 - on your portfolio
47:02 - people are going to want to talk about
47:04 - that and they'll be like hey so tell us
47:06 - tell us about the kobe tracker tell us
47:07 - about
47:08 - you know the netflix club and if you
47:10 - don't know what you're talking about
47:10 - it's gonna be obvious i mean anyone
47:12 - could go follow tutorial
47:13 - not everyone could build something out
47:14 - on their own so here's my challenge to
47:15 - you
47:16 - after you build it or after you've built
47:18 - any of these things add your own twist
47:20 - to it
47:20 - i don't mean change it from black to
47:23 - white i don't mean
47:24 - some stupid css though i mean like make
47:26 - it challenging right if it's a netflix
47:28 - thing
47:28 - what if you can add something in the
47:30 - back end that can track a user and their
47:32 - favorite movies and then
47:34 - you know how netflix has like the 97
47:36 - tracking or like oh this is 97
47:39 - probably you're going to like this or
47:40 - not yeah the recommended page yeah the
47:41 - algorithm try to implement that try to
47:43 - see if you could figure that out
47:44 - yeah just like every time you click on
47:46 - one like here here's a cool one like if
47:48 - you
47:48 - if you click on one of the videos like
47:50 - in the netflix app once you're done when
47:51 - you click on a video it'll actually play
47:52 - the trailer for that show or movie
47:54 - why don't you keep a counter and then um
47:56 - just have like an ordered rank like oh
47:57 - this is your favorite show
47:58 - favorite movie this is your second
47:59 - favorite depending on how many times you
48:00 - clicked on it so that's a very simple
48:02 - thing to implement
48:03 - but you could do that you could even go
48:05 - and like okay try to create
48:06 - a very similar app like an amazon prime
48:09 - app or something like you could try to
48:10 - mirror a very similar app and just apply
48:12 - the same ideas
48:13 - to another project and then boom now you
48:14 - have two projects and one was a tutorial
48:17 - and one
48:17 - you kind of came campbell came up with
48:19 - it yourself
48:20 - so um
48:24 - yeah so definitely portfolios no matter
48:25 - what is is really good it just really
48:27 - showcases your skills
48:28 - and i think at the end of the day
48:33 - college is only worth it if i mean first
48:35 - of all for the experience i think it's
48:37 - worth it
48:37 - um and if you're going to a really good
48:40 - school and you kind of
48:40 - go down the academic route then it's
48:42 - worth it but and if it's if it's cheap
48:44 - it's worth it so if it meets those three
48:45 - criteria yes but other than that i
48:48 - honestly think being self-taught and
48:49 - doing some things
48:50 - um on your own is the better course and
48:52 - then you can try to get some experience
48:54 - and then at that point if you really
48:55 - want to pursue a higher level education
48:57 - you can but i mean once you started
48:58 - making once you start making money
49:00 - you're kind of just like
49:02 - you don't really want to go to college
49:04 - and pay money to do stuff you know and
49:05 - like you have to like
49:07 - it's just once you're in the real world
49:09 - you eventually get used to it and you
49:10 - start like pursuing the things that
49:12 - actually matter to you so i feel
49:13 - i feel like personally college uh
49:18 - i feel college is worth it for a year
49:20 - and then drop out and then go to pursue
49:22 - your own stuff like have have one year
49:23 - of the college life and then see how it
49:25 - is make some friends
49:26 - go to some parties and then uh and then
49:28 - you know actually
49:30 - start getting yourself together and
49:31 - pursuing stuff so
49:33 - that's my opinion and

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys aaron here from cleverprogrammer and i'm here with daniel so um he's never actually been on a stream before but daniel actually currently works at blue origin as a software developer um and so i got him on here on this call really quick and he and i are going to be riffing about is college worth it for uh programmers so i currently have my video on my screen i should be here um but yeah we're gonna be going over is college worth it for programmers in 2020 uh and beyond so uh we're just going to be having a conversation really here hey guys aaron here from clever progress pros and cons i'm here with daniel so we just kind of want to touch on he's never actually been on a stream before but um i'll go ahead and answer that with my story so yeah we're gonna guarantee that i need to call it more safer currently i am a software engineer working for blue origin if you guys don't know me having fortune is hey guys just give it some time man how long you've been working there for a couple of years now i've been working there almost for like about three years now almost three years yeah so i'll go ahead almost three years in january and it's basically my background currently i went to college is because it's one of those universities is know oh god guys i'm not going to be able to do anything i'm not going to be able to achieve much at all right but over the last over those four years that i was working i was actually not just focused on school but i was working outside of school as well i was getting externships basically externship is like an internship where you work for free and i was just trying to get i never heard that before externships right so it's just for the experience that's exactly why you do that right okay yeah and and i was like i was going to do put in the work work for free to learn mobile development because that's kind of what i was going into that's kind of what i was a little bit passionate about there but i was really active trying to learn as much as i could trying to build up my technical skill set and in the matter of the four years when i graduated i was actually able to graduate with offers from big tech companies so i had an offer from youtube google and i had an offer for microsoft and had offered from blue origin so it was crazy because what i wanted to what i learned was it's not about where you are or where you're starting from it's about where you end up and then what are the things that you're going to do there to end up so everyone and even aaron knows this what we're about to say might actually disappoint you might go against everything you believe in this life call about what college is and whether you need it or whether you're not we'll be discussing all those things but what you have to realize is regardless whatever path you take you can still build that future that you want for yourself if you want to become though one second guys they said there's voice problems voice problems 100 guys talking now let me mute you on speak again oh speak again daniel testing testing um yo guys can you guys hear me audio problem audio problem sorry guys i didn't see you guys in the chat the voices are looping oh [ __ ] voices are looping as i like feedback probably is it still looping you guys oh [ __ ] and then the stream is is uh loading um it might still be going yo is okay hey can you guys hear me it is solved now it's okay great now it's fine perfect perfect you guys hear me am i good okay yeah they're saying audio is great it's good enough awesome uh i don't know how much you got screwed up there but uh yeah i'll recap super quick got it right big lesson big lesson is it doesn't matter where you start what matters is where you want to end up and what it is that you're going to do what work are you going to put in to be able to get to that spot so that's being a freelancer what projects are you going to take on what mentors are you going to get across what community are you going to put yourself in to learn the technical skill sets to learn the soft skill sets that you need to become the freelancer that is living that free or basically that lifestyle where you're your own boss you're working on your own time you have time to enjoy with your family you have time to enjoy life or if you want to go to the corporate world and go up the corporate ladder right where you actually you know you get the job they want at big tech company you get the nice 401k compensation that they give you which is awesome and all that good stuff then what are the things that you have to do whether it's academic or nonacademic to get to that point and those are some of the things that we're going to be discussing today because you might or might not need college depending on your situation definitely definitely and yeah i think it really depends yeah it definitely depends on your situation what's interesting about you daniel is you're currently working at blue origin as a software developer which is awesome amazing but you're also kind of doing some business stuff on the side right like more freelance based uh so well first of all for for your job at blue origin was your degree useful did you already mention that and like landing the lining the interviews or or um like it being on your resume was it helpful so that's a great question and you know this is something that i've talked a lot about with my friend so here's the thing when big tech companies are trying to hire for someone the thing is they're getting so many applications they're getting hit with like thousands and thousands of applications per day that's why they're such a low acceptance rate right it's not necessarily because they only accept these geniuses they accept people who put in the work who learned the skill but it's just because so many people are applying it's kind of like the mecca and everyone's trying to just travel there and google's like hey we can't hire any everyone so we have to have that filtering process so that's what that filtering process starts with which is the resume now very often because recruiters have that system set up they'll be like hey you know maybe find me someone that has a higher gpa than whatever that may be or filter it in these mechanisms so if you do the traditional path which is what i'll tell my friend if you're the traditional path where you go to school then in that case maybe the grades might be a little bit important to get that filtering mechanism but after that no am i allowed to cuss yeah it's fine okay i mean like cussing is fine just no sensitive topics like youtube's signboard fine with custom just know like controversial stuff you know stay politically correct okay that's what i'm saying i'll say pc then look like after that like google doesn't give a [ __ ] about what your gpa was after you graduate they want to see if you can produce if you can write code if you can actually help them develop whatever product it is that the team is trying to hire you so what that means for you is you know after that initial filtering phase if you go to traditional path with high school or sorry with college if you have a good gpa at that point it's all about what projects have you developed what things have you actually done that shows that you're proactive about getting that experience that shows that you're passionate about programming and developing software now here's the cool thing right there's also other ways that you can get past that filtering mechanism if you don't have a background in computer science but you're still going to need that other component of showing that you have the experience which is building the projects which is working with teammates which is have you know mentoring people being inside of an amazing community like the profit with javascript community right and the reason i'm saying that is because the way you can now go around that is maybe you do networking you get to know someone that can be a referral or whatever that may be we could dive into those details if anyone wants to know those details but the important thing is you still need the practice you still need the experience because they're putting a risk to hiring you right they're like hey man like you've shown all these things we don't know if it's going to work out or not but let's bring you on so they at least want to make sure it's it's not to risk for them because they're absolutely crushing it with whatever side projects it is that you might have going on plus you're learning you're proactive it just shows you as an individual who's willing to take action to move forward and learn and do the things that you have to do to excel at that job got it thanks daniel yeah yeah this that's a really good point um i mean yeah from my point of view uh to to add on to that point uh personally um oh you lost daniel there for a second are you there yeah yeah yeah okay yeah i was trying to switch the camera i'm gonna mess with it a little more to switch but keep going brother got it yo so uh lost my train of thought there um what were you just talking about well uh basically so you need that experience to be able to land a job was though oh yeah i was pushing up god i got it yeah you need the experience on the job yeah so that's definitely true that's the problem that i personally ran into uh when i moved to los angeles i was i was currently a graduate student studying computer science and artificial intelligence at georgia tech like i mentioned earlier and i thought it'd be really easy to find a job you know i have i had my bachelor's degree i had my resume everything i had an eight month internship at the leading tech company in hawaii paid internship and i did some really cool ai computer vision stuff there and i thought it'd be really easy to find a job um but apparently it kind of depends on the company but people don't like considering internships as like real world experience for whatever reason so whenever i was applying to jobs like i literally couldn't land any i was i was applying i applied to 50 jobs literally and um all of them were like entry level positions and they're like oh you need this small amount of years to get the job this you need one year of experience minimum two years of experience middle which is like this weird uh paradox kind of kind of thing like chicken or the situation like how do you get the experience if you haven't had your entrylevel job and it's not even unique to the coding industry you know i'm sure a lot of industries have the same problem um but i answered that problem i mean that's actually handed off on the cover program our team because i reached out to qazi i met him in person at a seminar once and then um i hit him up asking if you knew anybody hiring but he said i could just start with him and i ended up there and was the best thing that ever happened to be honest but the point i want to make is yeah there is an issue getting getting a job even with a really good with a degree and partially partially through my master's degree at a really really like one of the top 10 20 schools in the country um top 10 for i think number i think they're number eight for computer science in the country or number seven tied for number seven or something georgia tech at the time um so it was just a struggle and i kind of realized yeah like if you have the experience you have the connections that's really all you need and it kind of just goes back into like sales and business principles of hey how do you land this job um or how do you how do you start freelancing as long as you can get the job done you can get your foot in the door and really sell yourself then that's really all you need like do you do you feel like your degree was worth it like how much like do you completely regret it or uh if you could go back in time would you have not have done it and like tried to pursue something sooner so uh i like to answer that question in this way and here's here's a reality if i look at what i'm currently doing right now i could probably pick out of my fouryear degree i could probably think and pick about less than a handful of classes that are strictly applicable to what i'm doing yes yes now yes yes that's because computers that were worth it and a handful professors that were not worth it that that yeah i had lots of those professors and those professors that they just showed up oh everyone has this professor they just show up they have their powerpoint there they turn it on and they just start reading it to you it's like yeah like it's all there and you have to go out there and learn by yourself yeah figure all that [ __ ] out to be like oh my god what do i have to do so yes those professors are out there but then there's the ones that also are willing to put in that time for you right so if you do happen to go to like that university like stanford the mit you're going to find those professors that are not only super knowledgeable they're like geniuses but they're also really good at teaching now if you happen to go to a school like that i went to which you know isn't that huge or that prestigious or maybe i don't know if you have this experience in hawaii erin but then there's just gonna be some professors that they're just there to do their thing and they're not great teachers right so then that that teaching principle doesn't come like it doesn't translate over so well and then it's like oh man well kind of sucks for me because now i don't feel like putting in the effort when i didn't see the professor putting in the effort as well yeah and this is actually an interesting thing about kazi i want to mention um if anybody who doesn't know kazzy's story i mean everybody should know kazi who's watching this channel but uh who's that yeah what the [ __ ] cosby where is that boy um no but qazi he was before he started the clever programmer channel um he was actually at school for computer science and he was taking classes from his professors but he actually started freelancing himself and was able to land a 20 uh 20 000 contract with uh some company so i don't know some plumbing company or freaking electric company i don't know something along those lines he was coding some system up for the company to like manage some stuff uh something like that and and after a bit he was making a lot more money uh he was learning from his professors but at some point he was he started to make more money than his professors and his professor started asking him for tips on how to uh like what he was doing so like he noticed that he was like wait a minute my professor is asking me to teach him stuff like what is going on and he ended up dropping out um you have some of those uh some of those professors and then sometimes you can kind of transcend them but then of course there's really great pressures like georgia tech like literally every professor i had there was just amazing the content and the the the amount of intelligence at that level of school is just phenomenal like it's the world's best you know when you go to like one of the world's best schools uh in the usa or like if you're like at oxford or something in the uk or whatever other countries like waterloo canada there's like good colleges all over the world like you'll usually have really good professors and you'll learn a lot but it's not always applicable to what you actually want to do which is what daniel said earlier right so exactly so you could start to develop those things that you want to do by exploring with your own personal projects so i mentioned before i start to get into mobile development why because aaron i don't remember but do you ever remember the game flappy bird oh hell yeah of course i played the hell out of there i was playing i literally if anybody who doesn't know what that is let me pull it up really quick so uh you guys remember flappy bird oh can you play it can you play it on on browser maybe i can put the computer yeah i don't know it says there's a oh right here oh okay so this let me change my screen there we go so here so here's okay so um what happens is when you have to click and you jump right is this is what you're talking about right yeah it was a mobile that's it that's all you have to do and you're just gonna get bounce okay okay so uh i need to story out guys okay okay let me go this is us this is the hardest easiest game you're ever ever gonna come across okay and it literally took the world by storm everyone was posting just videos playing flappy bird everyone's posting their highest scores i'm just gonna this game just went yeah keep playing man this game went completely viral now i'm gonna be honest i was a little money hungry and i was still in college so i was like man how much is this developer making turns out i think he was making like 50 000 a day or something like that and i was like dude 50k a day this is yeah i heard about that like if you have a viral app like you can make a crap money it's just a matter of getting it to go viral like now now here's the thing you know now yeah the mobile market has gotten like crazy saturated because people saw that opportunity so a lot of people went there i'm just embarrassing myself but like i can't even pass the first one but but like i just simply remember playing this in my physics 2 class i'm like screw this like i want to become a mobile app developer so what i started to do was i start to research hey how can i build an app for the android how can i build an app for ios and i started to learn at swift i learned along with xcode and i learned java and the android studio and i was able to start to build these applications and i was like you know i'll take this a step further this is where my externship came out i reached out to a local company like here i am this college kid all the experience i have is for my school i reach out to a local company who's android development i'm like hey guys like well first i try to apply for a job but then i'm like no you know what you're too new you had no experience totally fine i understand that right that's that's the chicken and the x and there you're talking about right they want every college grad to have five years of experience when they haven't even been in college for five years yeah like this so silly exactly so i was like okay well let's do this what if you can hand me off a project that is not priority that no one is working on that you guys want to work on for the future and i could just start messing around with that let me just dabble in there see what i can do and see if i could make something cool for you guys so they had an idea of an android application they wanted to have but they didn't have the resources so they handed it off to me so i would show up like i'm still in school i'm working part time and i'm sure like my only off day was friday i'm giving up my entire damn friday to show up to this office and just mess around with android development like that's the level of commitment that i had to developing the skill sets that i needed and it wasn't even that thinking in terms of a job i was just having fun i know a lot of you guys here in the stream have fun going through these projects that you know like all these live uh codings that that clever programmers putting out there's so much fun they're super amazing when sunny with knobs when kazi hop on that was the type of fun i was having i was willing to give up my fridays for that but because i was developing that skill set that was a secondary consequence now i was able to actually develop a skill set alongside with that but again that goes based off what i always say that is priority building more projects and if you could build and find projects that you're excited about then you're just gonna it's like this upward spiral you're excited about it you're learning more you're having fun and then you're getting more experience and just keep going up and up the feedback cycle just all the positive reinforcement yeah and then you end up a blue origin right and now you're putting us on on mars is that what's happening oh we're putting you guys in space it's better than mars because mars is limited yeah are you oh i mean i guess we are you guys trying to go to the moon like what is blue origin's overall goal right now i don't unders i didn't actually dive into them too much is a side tangent yeah for sure so if you go to blurring's website our big mission is filling with people living and working in space living and working right space so just end this exactly okay cool well literally in space not in planets because you know space space is unlimited versus planets being limited if we were able to somehow populate mars we'd probably only be able to double in size because mars is still a planet but if we're able to populate space at that point it's literally unlimited oh [ __ ] you mean creating like huge space stations just like yeah like like have you seen them look up o'neill colonies look up o'neill colonies oh neil was actually inspired from fictional writing right of like people and this utopia in space the o'neill cylinder right but you can just look at the images okay so basically this big cylinder that's rotating at the perfect speed to imitate gravity and then you just have this environment where you're able to actually create like a simulate a different world so like a right half and halo right yeah exactly like a halo it's just like another place you could live in space and if you can create that at that point it's like dude you can expand and grow as big as you want you don't have to worry about like hey you know if we plan if we call nate mars weapons will run out of space in mars like here in earth or resources or whatever that may be long term yeah because like getting to a different solar system is like that's like another beast in its own i see dude that's cool i was just curious i don't want to get too off topic on this topic but uh awesome so uh le going backtracking a little bit so you said um i was leading do you remember what i asked you uh before i went on this thing we were talking about i might have do you remember i think we're talk dude it might have been we're talking if college was worth it then we started talking about and then we started talking about you know how the experience plays uh so that's when the flappy bird because i learned android development because i was obsessed with flappy bird that's why i was like i need to learn how to program applications i could be rich now unfortunately that wasn't my path but i had a lot of fun learning how to develop mobile applications yeah yeah okay so um i guess to answer this question directly uh let's kind of dissect a little bit we've been we've kind of just been chatting for a bit about um college versus not uh but put it very clearly what is your opinion on having like like what scenario is college like the right decision and what scenario is college the wrong decision versus like um you know being selftaught or doing a coding boot camp or even taking a course from people like us you know um learning how to code i think i i think if i were if i were my own shoes back in the in back in the i was going to say back in the future back in the past these would be the two things that would dictate to me whether i want to go to college or not one is my finances okay so with my specific college is yeah huge my specific college case i was in the same city where i grew up so i was able to live in my house and i had scholarships enough that my first two years of college i was actually getting a 500 paycheck from school plus everything was already paid off and i had a job so during college i was in the financial situation where i finished college like with money in my bank right and not a lot of people have that fortunate situation so if you have to go twenty thousand dollars into debt and that was a decision i made i could have gone to ut it's a better known college but i would have to take a loan i didn't have a scholarship i would put myself 80 000 in debt and i was not willing to do that didn't matter what the hell i was gonna do graduating i was not willing to do that yeah it's hard like even if you land a sixfigure job at a good company it's gonna take you like two to five years to pay it off depending where you're living because a lot of the highpaying jobs too like if you're in san fran 100k isn't that much because you're living in the san fran where the living expenses is just super high so you're only saving so much a year um so that student debt is nasty so that's one big thing if you're going to go into student debt i feel like college is almost never worth it in my opinion uh i mean there's a bunch of different point of views online like here let me change my desktop so i did a search here on google earlier it says is college worth it for programmers so the first thing that pops up is degree probably not worth it unless you are not selfconfident enough to get hired without one so uh software engineering that's dockychange.com i don't even know who this is but this is the first thing that popped up can i add something to that because that's close to my second answer yeah so my second answer comes down to selfawareness okay now what i mean by that is you i would have to know myself and my past and how basically what he says how confident i am in my ability to teach myself and pay to surround myself with the right people or whether you know and i started to pay and strong myself with the right people or with people who could level me up whether it was through college or through like some sort of programming community right but i just had to have that self that level of selfawareness whether hey can i really put my you know nose to the grindstone learn everything by myself try to involve myself with communities go out there network or is it better for me if i kind of have a roadmap laid out even though it might not be the perfect roadmap for me even though i might deviate from it but at least having that roadmap gets me started to build that confidence so i want to go back to the answer i think that's the second part which is having that selfawareness in your confidence if you constrain yourself with the right community and the right mentors whether that's through school or whether that's through a programming community like clever programmer then at that point you could build a conference in either one but you have to know which one you are going to respond better to yeah absolutely yeah whatever i feel like yeah college is very expensive and there is a lot of value in having that degree because from a default perspective like they will probably prefer somebody with a degree versus somebody without a degree if everything else is the same because it's kind of like a proven track record of oh you've done this but if you're going to go into debt like it's i don't personally don't think it's worth it for me i didn't i was in debt i paid off school as i was going through it because i went to an affordable college and um i had a decent job and i worked parttime but i think at the end of the day whatever the best in learning environment the best learning and networking environment for you is good for you to achieve your goals that would be the best place to be so a lot of people in our courses here i clever programmer by the way if anybody wants to join um if anybody anybody wants to become a a javascript developer and make a living from it as a freelancer or eventually land a job at a cool company a fan company uh like like where where daniel works then we have a free webinar training down in the description you can check it out and it's completely free just watch it it gives you some value and then um at the end uh we we offer you to join the course if you actually want to pursue things further uh which is just a paid course you can join our community and you have like network of all developers and accountability so really cool um mentioning that if that's your kind of thing but if not uh totally cool too but let's get back to yeah i mean look like i was saying you have to pick your community you have to pick your mentors now the question is if it's college are you gonna put tens of thousands of dollars into a system that for programmers has been proven that you don't need or is it going to be in the community like the clever programmer community where you can learn and build projects like i said projects are king you learn to build projects through experience and you're able to network with people who are maybe a little level b above you a little level under you at the same level and you could learn from every single one you can help people out and it's just your choice who do you want to surround yourself with because everyone already knows is the most cliche thing but you are the average of your five closest people yeah right you're private and if you don't take that to heart if you don't take that to heart in five years you're gonna be in the exact same [ __ ] spot you're in right now you're gonna be in this wishful thinking like man yes i did do that where could i be my disappear because you're doing the same thing day in and day out but if you're on people who are doing ambitious things as well other ambitious developers other freelancers uh people like us that are working at companies like killer programmer or blue origin then uh you kind of you're constantly reminded of what's possible and what you can do and then you can kind of get out of that you can kind of change your trajectory you got a pattern interrupt you got to switch your way of living out of switch your way shock yourself huh exactly albert einstein said you know insanity is doing the same thing over and over again i think you're gonna get a different result yeah if you're not in the community and you're not getting results well you gotta go get in the community and then you'll start getting closer to getting results if not getting those results yeah so yeah very important about the learning environment the community that you're in um one argument for college is that because honestly i i met a lot of good professors i mean i i feel like 15 of professors were were good like 15 of the professors um and 15 of the classes were good and then that overlap was probably like five percent of the classes were actually applicable to what i was doing like learning the programming basics and everything i probably could have done that on my own uh but a class like algorithms or something could be a little bit difficult so i feel like those classes were worth it um but other than that just i mean i made a lot of good friends and made some connections that's how i got my internship but i feel like if i knew about this thing like clever programmer um or even coding boot camps which were like around ten thousand dollars were available i might have done that instead uh just because save some money cut out the [ __ ] like you don't have to take you know political science and writing and all those these other things uh but um i just it really depends honestly i feel like college was worth it for me but not for my professional uh career mainly for the connections i built and the experiences i had so it was worth it in that aspect 100 um but i from this business perspective like if like if you're more business oriented and you want a freelance or you want to do something cool or start a startup then you really don't need anything at all you just got to have the drive you got to have the right people around you like daniel said you got to have the vision and the belief and the confidence to just go for it you can learn things on your own um like do do do problems on hacker rank you know and and just get good and just land a lot of job like does google like did google look at your resume how did you land that interview with google and then get the job offer too uh with google i think i just sent in my resume it passed the filtering process and then we just went into the interview process so i had to do my phone interview i had to do my virtual technical interview then i had to do my onsite technical interview after that and then similar thing for microsoft microsoft actually came to the campus i did a campus interview then it was good enough to take me on for the onsite interview and i did that onsite interview and that's what i ended up doing for those two but so i guess i just want to take it back a little bit but you know you asked me that questions like hey is was it worth it for me would i do it again i would do college again because again of those two specific situations financially i ended up making money from college right and second selfawareness i knew that i wasn't in that spot just yet where i was confident in my ability to learn by myself so i kind of needed that road map but i would do college completely different if i was able to go back and do it right like on my side yeah during my history classes i'd be programming right yes yes finishing your coding project application yeah where you're learning about political science like that was back in the days when trump was i'd be making flappy birds bro i'm terrible at that game man my score was everyone was i don't do i think there was a single i never met a single good if you have a score higher than 50 on flappy bird and you have a screenshot from the past you better like put it on youtube or something i want to see that share it let me see if there's any questions by the way in the comments uh yeah let's do it boss yeah um i mean these aren't really they're asking like to limit questions google dumped angular is that true did google dump angular mr younabe i don't know if that's that's true or not all right guys do this right now if you have a question about college if you have a question about developing your career by the path go ahead and drop some questions down there so that we can answer them because again like i i feel this is so much value because this is literally our chance to mentor you guys virtual yeah yeah this is our chance to literally mentor you we can pick up your question right now we can tell you hey from aaron's experience from my experience what would we do in that case and now like literally you could go forward and do whatever it is that you you need to do next so guys this is a super opportunity this is an opportunity that you know you can also have inside of the community if you happen to come across us and reach out to us but again take advantage of it if not then we'll just keep playing flappy bird no i'm not gonna play flappy bird i have to keep an eye on the chat to see if there's any questions um i don't take the use so somebody says he doesn't take the useless classes in college um i mean that's that's true another good question is how to get experience in college so those two questions so i don't take the useless classes uh i mean some it depends on the college you go to i know a lot of like more modern colleges that got approved for their curriculum um they can kind of get away with bending things and but usually for most colleges you're required to let me change the camera here back to us you're usually required to um take like political science and history and stuff right like you have to and then you kind of like front load all your your major classes you have to major in something in college um but i mean you can only do that to an extent right uh so i feel like yeah that is useful but i mean you are going to bring a lot of time it's just you kind of see the other value of being in college if you really want to do it uh another question though is how to gain experience in college so i'm gonna take that as like real world experience like why are you doing it and i mean first thing for me is like maybe just land a parttime job at a small company or a paid internship or something uh the internship for me didn't work out for some reason people didn't care about it they wanted like actual experience like a real job even though i was getting paid at a real company doing real work i was confused about that distinction there but i would just i would probably just try to find a job like right away you know like user connection connections with your professors or something like that do a summer summer job or something like that um i didn't personally do it did you did you have any experience and you did you said you mentioned your externship yeah so so i mean like i was wanting to do whatever the [ __ ] i had to do to get a job so i said yeah i'm gonna give up my fridays i'm gonna work for free so that i can learn this and i can get the job and i can start to get that experience so if you happen to be oh man no one's hiring me i'm sending out my applications well [ __ ] work for free you're not worth anything yet if you're not getting hired you're not worth anything yet you haven't proven yourself you haven't gotten that experience so be willing to put yourself up for free work learn get that experience right don't do it for the money do it because you like it do it because you want to learn more do it because you want to grow more when you actually become worth something that's when you're going to get paid big dollars yeah definitely and me personally i had my internship in the very last semester of my college so my eighth semester before i graduated i took four years in my undergrad and i thought it would um i thought it would have been more beneficial if i actually landed an internship much earlier on in my programming career so honestly a lot of my early classes were kind of bad at my undergrad school and i couldn't really grasp the concepts that easily i feel like went to a better school actually would have been much better and i could have landed something but if you could land an internship like a summer internship in your first summer of college that'd be great like for free like like you're like like unpaid like daniel said just get the experience you're not worth anything prove that to yourself it might be painful but if you're doing it for free then hey it's good hop on your resume and then the next summer maybe try to get a paid internship in the third summer maybe try to get a parttime job and actually get some real experience and then do parttime work and parttime school until you finish your degree but if you can actually get some experience and degree in tandem i feel like that's actually um good again i mean how do you land that parttime job to begin with because you need experience to get that job so chicken or the egg it's a struggle but i mean if you maximize your networking and everything then you eventually find something i mean that's how i met causie and connections are very surprising so ask your professors if you're in college um if they have any and like i said you can always also be working on your own projects on the side something you're passionate about something that you want to learn something absolutely we didn't even mention that like portfolios and projects but didn't mean to interrupt you always go on yeah no no perfect perfect point like right now i'm coaching my friend so that basically he he was like an economics major right now he's doing data analysis for a company he's like hey i want to be a programmer like if you go to his github literally his very first line of code was committed in february as of right now as of august he is this close to landing his first programmer developer job how was he able to do that he put in the work for those seven months after his 40hour work week he was getting straight to programming and he was enjoying it he hired another mentor he had two people you know when the industry another mentor has helped people through that transition and he's learning as much as he can he's applying as much as he can and he's doing it towards building projects building projects and i guarantee you he's going to get the first job and it's going to be paid because of the experience he got from just building projects so here's the thing if you also take that route where you want to build projects and get the experience it's not this one project that's going to make it like oh man this whole project didn't give me my job no you better build like 10 [ __ ] projects out of those 10 projects maybe one or two are going to be good those are the ones you put on your resume not not like oh i built two projects can i get a job now no [ __ ] you better be putting in the time yeah to build out project after project after project to really learn what you have to do to build those experiences and how those shitty projects are going to have just a couple are going to be worth showing yeah definitely you want to showcase with your best foot forward and make sure you do enough of the work to get there it's like it's like anything you know working out you got to you got to do enough work to get the results so if you're serious about something like put in the effort so definitely build a lot build portfolios and portfolio is useful if you want to freelance or or get a job it doesn't matter uh hey you're you're coming out of focus bro a little bit um but um what was it saying best foot forward yeah best foot forward uh and you just want to get things on your portfolio so you can really just um yeah just put your best foot forward i think that was the whole point i was wrapping up there it's yeah perfect it's perfect yeah like if the if the program i mean if the if the applications you built are kind of relevant to what you're doing too then that's a big bonus it's like hey i've done this before uh even if you don't have different work experience if you can get through the through the interview and kind of just showcase and really show them that you'll be a good fit for the position and speak to them clearly and show them what you've done then you have a good chance of landing a job so um let me see if there's any other questions you have anything to add to that daniel yeah portfolio man i mean i also did not have a portfolio i had a resume but i'm telling like the thing i told my friend is like yo we need to build that portfolio because a portfolio is look when they're hiring you they're not hiring a developer they're hiring a person okay yeah yeah you're not hiring a developer they're hanging a person that's something you also have to understand when you go into the hiring process but let's look at the other way so what you have to understand is they're not looking for projects they're looking for a human that is going to be compatible to the skill sets and the soft skills the soft uh the soft people communication skills that they need to fill the role so portfolio is a great way to communicate that because you can put literally you can put your personality on a web page which is insane like a resume you can't put your personality like you can't the only thing you could write about is [ __ ] that you've done like hey i worked as this and i did that experience or whatever in your portfolio in your website you can pull your personality you can make like a little blog you could post content you could document what you've been doing you could document like man worked on this project i struggled a lot you share a story you share your struggle and people are able to see your transformation they're able to see your specific journey and you build out a portfolio in that manner when you show it to someone they see that human characteristic of you and it's not just a resume it's not just all these papers are coming across your desk and your coding style too they can see like if you comment code right and all that stuff exactly now someone sees it they understand if you're gonna be a good fit for what it is they're looking for because it's not just words on the paper yeah you're not just another yeah paper in the stack you know you can stand a little more with your portfolio i mean the one one counter argument to that is a lot of a lot of people do have portfolios you're competing with all them which but it just goes back to you gotta you gotta have your stuff together and get some good projects on your portfolio that's why we're so project based here at cleverprogrammer like we love building all these clones on youtube and in our in our paid courses and programs and mentoring and coaching we teach a lot of projectbased uh things everything is projectbased so you're building um you're building portfolios basically that's what you're doing when you're going over courses um or going going through our youtube content so all these are great things people have landed people have already landed jobs just by going through our free coding um clones um oh you're you're uh yeah yeah i just keep switching it because my camera is messing up my bad brother all good but yeah so we actually have people landing like 90k 96k 100k 110k jobs and contracts just by doing some of the apps that we built up together and just popping on our portfolio and showcasing putting their best foot forward it's like hey this person built a covent tracker this person built a instagram clone a netflix clone a hula clone and amazon clone and um if people see that and they're really impressed by and they want a friend of developer that usually is has a big wow factor and apparently it's been working for people so uh definitely definitely do that i think portfolio is honestly stronger than a resume because at the end of the freaking day they want you to be able to code up whatever they need to be done of course they're hiring a person so don't be a weirdo but if you're a decent person you fit in and then you also have the skill set and you've proven that through portfolio then you have a really good chance of landing whatever job is in front of you regardless of college you're not so um oh did you when you you had offers at google and microsoft and blue origin was it just those three nothing else though those are the only three i applied to and i ended up getting them so i was like damn like at first i was like like you apply but now looking back i was like dude i should have applied everywhere man because it's cool when they fly you out they pay for everything so it's like dude i could have gone all over the world dang man that's that's cool i kind of wish i went down that route a little bit but i just kind of jumped on clever program right away i guess i went down the startup route very very fast um with qazi here building the the brand a little bit more over the past two years but um i feel like we've hit most of the the the point what were you gonna say yeah i mean i mean in the end it's there's gonna be so many things that would be nice that we could do right but one of the biggest things that i think i learned from from warren buffy he's like look this is what you guys gotta get a paper happy birthday warren buffett oh it is turned into 90. this is turned 90 today for warren buffett baby this is for one buck that's hilarious but basically says okay 90. this 90 year old this 90 year old billionaire said this he's like get a sheet of paper and write out 25 things that you want to do with your life right like these 25 things that that you know in the end you want to accomplish you want to be able to do whatever that may be and then what you need to do next is you need to scratch out 20 of those and the five that you haven't scratched out those are the things you're going to focus on yeah and the principle behind that is you have to understand that in life there's going to be so many things you could do what if like right now you might be doing software like man what if instead of software i don't know i did some instagram modeling instagram modeling is the thing now you know like what if i did something else right so there's gonna be so many things distracting you right but you have to focus on those five things that you're gonna prioritize because maybe instagram modeling was like number 10 but it's off your list now and you have to focus on that top one which is software becoming the developer that you want to become whether it's a freelancer whether that's getting a job with the big tech company with the startup whatever that may be because fundamentally when you start to focus that's when you actually start to get clear by your goals and make progress in the direction that you want to go absolutely absolutely daniel thank you so much value provided thank you for having me on this call i was i was proud to just like answer questions go over myself but daniel hopped on last minute he works with us by the way clever programmer i don't think he's ever been on a stream before so this might be a new face but killer guy killer programmer um very interesting story but uh last thing we should start probably wrapping up in the next few minutes here uh one question that i want to say is somebody was saying how do you get started with a with an entrylevel portfolio as a programmer so uh just to clearly answer that question just start coding projects man like start coding some of the stuff on youtube channel join our our paid courses start building those in the portfolio and just build things that you're passionate about and excited about because that's the best way to get started you have to be excited at the beginning and eventually what the habit's built sometimes it gets kind of rough but you can keep doing it because you have the habit but at the beginning just build cool projects and upload it to your github and just have it in a presentable way and just build a huge portfolio that's why it's called a portfolio like just start with a random clone if you can't pick one here i'm going to tell you what go uh go build the netflix club go find it i think sunny and kazzy code it up it's a great app just go code it up and put that on your portfolio so go do that like literally right after this video if you don't have a portfolio and you're a completely beginner coder um i mean if you're a complete beginner coder i think you need to know javascript uh to actually go to that video but if you know javascript basics if you've been watching this for a while just go do that and get that on your portfolio like right now go from beginning to end okay yeah and i want to add that real quick what i told my friend who's transitioning right in those seven months he's built out like eight or nine projects right now let me tell you those first seven are really crappy projects they're really beginner projects like the first one was literally like a hello world he has an alarm clock when you go to a page that's ticking like he was just learning basic javascript he has that in his github but that's not necessarily showcasing his portfolio right he later did like a simple rock paper scissors stuff he has that on github because he's documenting his journey but he doesn't necessarily have that on his portfolio now he got to the point where he has this complicated to do application right it's like a to do application you can add things prioritize things you could put time around things like it's this awesome application that he did right and whether he starts to get creative with it he starts to add a bunch of things now that's also on github so you can see his documentation but that's part of the portfolio because like i said you need to build out 10 projects and 10 of them you know seven eight are probably gonna suck and then two of them are gonna be really good right yeah yeah that's how it is the other thing is when you're building out those projects if you're going and you're following sunny or your knowledge or whoever's doing them make sure you understand what the [ __ ] you're building because if you put that on your portfolio people are going to want to talk about that and they'll be like hey so tell us tell us about the kobe tracker tell us about you know the netflix club and if you don't know what you're talking about it's gonna be obvious i mean anyone could go follow tutorial not everyone could build something out on their own so here's my challenge to you after you build it or after you've built any of these things add your own twist to it i don't mean change it from black to white i don't mean some stupid css though i mean like make it challenging right if it's a netflix thing what if you can add something in the back end that can track a user and their favorite movies and then you know how netflix has like the 97 tracking or like oh this is 97 probably you're going to like this or not yeah the recommended page yeah the algorithm try to implement that try to see if you could figure that out yeah just like every time you click on one like here here's a cool one like if you if you click on one of the videos like in the netflix app once you're done when you click on a video it'll actually play the trailer for that show or movie why don't you keep a counter and then um just have like an ordered rank like oh this is your favorite show favorite movie this is your second favorite depending on how many times you clicked on it so that's a very simple thing to implement but you could do that you could even go and like okay try to create a very similar app like an amazon prime app or something like you could try to mirror a very similar app and just apply the same ideas to another project and then boom now you have two projects and one was a tutorial and one you kind of came campbell came up with it yourself so um yeah so definitely portfolios no matter what is is really good it just really showcases your skills and i think at the end of the day college is only worth it if i mean first of all for the experience i think it's worth it um and if you're going to a really good school and you kind of go down the academic route then it's worth it but and if it's if it's cheap it's worth it so if it meets those three criteria yes but other than that i honestly think being selftaught and doing some things um on your own is the better course and then you can try to get some experience and then at that point if you really want to pursue a higher level education you can but i mean once you started making once you start making money you're kind of just like you don't really want to go to college and pay money to do stuff you know and like you have to like it's just once you're in the real world you eventually get used to it and you start like pursuing the things that actually matter to you so i feel i feel like personally college uh i feel college is worth it for a year and then drop out and then go to pursue your own stuff like have have one year of the college life and then see how it is make some friends go to some parties and then uh and then you know actually start getting yourself together and pursuing stuff so that's my opinion and
