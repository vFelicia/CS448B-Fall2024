00:00 - oh what is up guys how's it going this
00:02 - is kazzy here from cleverprogrammer.com
00:04 - today
00:05 - i am here with your boy papa react how's
00:09 - it going guys
00:10 - welcome back to day three of react
00:13 - native build so this is gonna be fun
00:15 - and we're going to be building on top of
00:17 - what we've already done so exciting
00:19 - stuff
00:19 - and we've got a new computer running so
00:21 - everything should be silky smooth right
00:22 - quasi that's right so this is going to
00:24 - be
00:25 - amazing because we have an imac pro
00:28 - and it's brand new so we're going to be
00:31 - installing
00:32 - all of the things with you today whether
00:34 - it's expo or node whatever we need to
00:36 - make this thing work
00:37 - we're going to be kind of installing
00:38 - that with you so that way you can
00:40 - actually keep up with us
00:42 - exactly and we're working on react
00:45 - native today as well and we're going to
00:47 - continue
00:47 - building our react native application
00:50 - the income tracker that we were actually
00:52 - building a few days ago
00:54 - exactly so really fun stuff we're going
00:56 - to be touching on things like
00:57 - expo uh today the main feature is going
01:01 - to be around react navigation
01:02 - so react native navigation so how you
01:04 - can navigate between stacks
01:06 - is something i did a long time ago but i
01:08 - don't remember how to do it so it's
01:09 - going to be fun
01:10 - going ahead and learning that together
01:11 - again um building that with kazi
01:14 - um so yeah in fact uh also welcome guys
01:18 - uh mohammed humza says i love these
01:19 - build videos but i think reactive
01:21 - typescript will also be good
01:22 - 100 we can go ahead and we will be
01:24 - covering typescript at some
01:26 - point as well yeah um yeah everything
01:28 - guys
01:29 - we'll pretty much eventually get around
01:30 - to everything beautiful
01:32 - all right with that said let's
01:35 - jump right into it so in order to
01:39 - run this app sonny on this computer
01:42 - um i believe that we're gonna need to
01:44 - install the expo cli is that right
01:47 - that's right so expo cli is gonna allow
01:50 - us to run
01:51 - so if you guys don't know what expo is
01:53 - um it's basically
01:55 - i mean what's the best way of explaining
01:56 - expo it's like a way to run the react
01:58 - native app
01:59 - yeah it just makes it easier to run the
02:01 - react react native apps instead of
02:03 - needing
02:04 - so many different things like um even
02:06 - xcode honestly i don't think you need
02:08 - xcode right to make this work
02:10 - i don't think so i don't think so in
02:12 - fact we can we'll check it now
02:14 - and also massive uh super chat from
02:17 - gabriel graves good to see you dude
02:19 - oh she said thank you for the donation
02:22 - dude gabriel gabe uh gabriel graves

02:43 - holy [ __ ] that blew up my ears actually
02:45 - a little bit
02:48 - especially with these headphones they
02:49 - actually blows the arrow ouch
02:51 - that hurt all right cool so
02:54 - dope let's get into it so now i also
02:58 - need
02:58 - npm yes so we're gonna have to install
03:02 - node
03:03 - all right cool get npm
03:06 - oh is that how you do it i usually do it
03:08 - with just uh
03:10 - go to node website download
03:14 - that little link there which one this
03:17 - one download node.js and npm right here
03:20 - yeah that's one from the node website
03:22 - once you install node it comes with npm
03:24 - i'm gonna go with the current one man i
03:26 - want the
03:28 - one the newest fanciest one
03:32 - this part can actually be great on how
03:34 - to install node
03:35 - js on your computer so maybe if somebody
03:38 - wants to clip it
03:40 - yeah you go ahead and like you can drop
03:42 - the time
03:43 - time stamps in the in the comments and
03:45 - i'll help everyone else that we can clip
03:46 - that from the
03:47 - you can actually message uh david or a
03:50 - monit if you want they can clip this
03:52 - moment
03:53 - okay
03:56 - all right cool so that is now installed
04:02 - beautiful
04:06 - let's see all right npm
04:09 - oh nice it looks like it found it let's
04:12 - do it awesome
04:13 - install expo it's working nice
04:16 - also guys you can notice that the
04:18 - command line right now looks kind of
04:19 - ugly right like it's got all this extra
04:21 - stuff going on
04:22 - uh we're gonna install a really handy
04:25 - tool
04:26 - called oh my zsh yes
04:29 - i love this tool it is the best
04:33 - i hate not having it when i get a new
04:34 - computer
04:36 - same every time i started a new job or
04:38 - something and they gave me a laptop i
04:39 - would always
04:40 - straight away oh my zsh and you
04:43 - literally just copy that command
04:44 - chuck it in the terminal and that's it
04:47 - it literally
04:48 - run and okay so this is saying uh
04:51 - rejected so because you're doing a
04:52 - global install aren't you
04:54 - so you might have to use sudo yeah
04:58 - there we go sudo
05:02 - and let's get this installed and while
05:05 - this is installing i'm going to open up
05:06 - another
05:07 - command line and hit this here
05:10 - so and we need the
05:14 - um xcode stuff so
05:17 - while that's doing that asm computing
05:19 - says what's up kazian saying new to the
05:21 - channel three days ago
05:22 - i know html css javascript php started
05:25 - getting to react three days ago
05:27 - and already know my way around thanks to
05:29 - you guys that's awesome dude
05:30 - that's great oh that's actually dope and
05:32 - i just realized i
05:34 - don't have my youtube open so i'm gonna
05:36 - actually go ahead
05:38 - and do just that
05:42 - oh the comments you mean yeah the
05:44 - youtube analytics or comments or any of
05:46 - that like i don't have it open
05:48 - nice bob builder says are you guys
05:52 - going to start building clones of react
05:53 - native soon yes in fact
05:55 - these series like the series of videos
05:58 - that we're dropping right now actually
05:59 - to show kind of warm you guys up to
06:00 - react native
06:01 - show you some of the features the
06:03 - fundamentals in react native like
06:04 - navigation how do you navigate through
06:06 - an app
06:07 - how it's very similar to react as in
06:09 - like how we're used to writing react and
06:11 - things like that
06:13 - um so we're gonna pretty much be doing
06:15 - that to introduce you
06:16 - and then we're gonna be doing some crazy
06:19 - big videos
06:20 - um so so get excited for that so if you
06:23 - guys love the clones let us know in the
06:24 - comments right now i can see
06:26 - uh even avail of availo so
06:29 - jeff says guys i think love you watch
06:32 - your clone videos it's helping me so
06:33 - much to understand and react concepts
06:34 - and all starting to make sense you're
06:36 - awesome
06:36 - i appreciate that dude so yeah i'm going
06:38 - to be dropping videos in react name also
06:40 - melbourne
06:41 - hey nice okay so now i got this thing
06:44 - working
06:46 - cool uh hopefully the xcode
06:49 - is installed what i was looking for no
06:51 - it's on no developers tools were found
06:53 - requesting install
06:55 - um what's going on can't stall because
06:58 - it's not currently available from the
06:59 - software update server
07:01 - interesting wait what did it say
07:05 - it said can't install
07:10 - even though i went installed it it said
07:13 - it gave me some weird error
07:17 - do we need csh we don't need it right
07:20 - like we just need to do it
07:21 - we don't need it right now it's just an
07:23 - additional thing
07:25 - all right i'm gonna just do npm start
07:27 - and i'm gonna get this app going bro
07:29 - okay so so it says opening dev tools in
07:33 - the browser
07:34 - okay nice and then
07:40 - let's open it guys you can scan the qr
07:42 - code that kazi's bringing up so expo
07:44 - another benefit of using it
07:46 - is it allows you to actually go ahead
07:49 - and share
07:50 - your running code so you guys can pull
07:52 - out your phone right now
07:53 - on android pull out a qr code read on
07:55 - iphone literally just point your camera
07:57 - at the screen
07:58 - and go ahead and do that i'm going to do
08:00 - that too and what we can do is
08:02 - everyone as we're coding can go ahead
08:05 - and demo the app on their phone
08:07 - which is pretty fun so it takes a little
08:09 - bit of time to download but
08:11 - once it's up and running you guys can
08:12 - actually see what we're coding on your
08:14 - own phone which is pretty cool
08:18 - yeah that always gets me super hyped up
08:20 - because i'm like
08:21 - hell yeah once i can see it on my phone
08:24 - it feels real to me
08:26 - exactly dude i'm just so hyped that like
08:29 - i
08:29 - jumped in the pool today dude i can't
08:31 - get over that i'm like [ __ ]
08:32 - killed it dude i'm gassed that's it soon
08:36 - you'll be jumping in it every day don't
08:37 - worry
08:38 - be good man freaking cannot find the
08:42 - variable you state a
08:44 - why are we using state um i fixed it
08:47 - i was using state a it was misspelled
08:50 - but i s
08:51 - but i fixed that misspelling i probably
08:53 - just didn't hit save
08:54 - reactive yeah
08:58 - what what is happening all right i'm
09:00 - gonna give you
09:01 - access to reading right and read and
09:04 - write
09:06 - what is why is hold on you state a is
09:09 - not defined
09:12 - um okay so that's actually
09:16 - some strange compiler stuff happening so
09:18 - i just probably didn't save it or
09:20 - something
09:21 - yeah i'm gonna i've stopped the package
09:23 - and then i'll run it again
09:25 - nice and then w to start it up in the
09:28 - browser
09:29 - opening the project the web browser
09:32 - and then you guys can see it starts
09:34 - building it in webpack
09:36 - and should be good oh nice
09:39 - nice nice nice nice nice
09:45 - okay localhost 1906. oh sick
09:49 - okay dude that's pretty sick then so you
09:50 - didn't actually install everything on
09:52 - xcode
09:52 - right to get that no you don't need
09:54 - xcode at all i think
09:56 - that's sick because xcode takes a year
09:59 - like ages to download
10:00 - yeah like i actually think yeah you just
10:03 - don't need it
10:04 - at all which makes it such a better
10:06 - experience in my opinion
10:08 - to use expo because like yeah xcode is
10:11 - just
10:12 - trash it takes so long yeah
10:16 - um go ahead and share your 19006
10:20 - ball with me um
10:23 - okay
10:27 - cool okay
10:30 - yeah guys if you're enjoying the videos
10:31 - and you're enjoying this series of
10:33 - videos go ahead and smash
10:34 - the thumbs up button allow this video to
10:36 - get out to more people
10:38 - and it tells us that you guys want more
10:39 - stuff and we're going to be dropping a
10:41 - hell of a lot of stuff around this
10:42 - uh this topic and react native and all
10:45 - sorts of new
10:46 - new tricks and topics server side
10:49 - bringing in stuff to enjoy
10:51 - what's up doing like next js type of
10:54 - stuff would be cool too at some point
10:56 - yeah yeah yeah next year dude i actually
10:59 - want to get into that quite a lot as
11:01 - well so
11:02 - um that would be sick yeah i did it once
11:05 - at tesco
11:06 - i was working with xjs and uh it's kind
11:08 - of a mind
11:09 - mind match to get around it yeah but
11:12 - very powerful
11:13 - like really really bad and it's super
11:14 - demand like if you can have nextgs on
11:17 - your on your portfolio as well if you
11:19 - react
11:19 - the tv and all that stuff then you're
11:22 - pretty jacked as a developer so
11:24 - right now all right i'm gonna try to get
11:27 - the app again
11:28 - so i'm gonna scan i just scanned it
11:31 - you guys can scan it too if you want
11:33 - while i hover over it
11:35 - and it's building it on my phone right
11:37 - now
11:40 - okay cool and what does it take to run
11:43 - an ios simulator again
11:46 - um i think
11:50 - i mean we couldn't run it successfully
11:52 - right for some reason oh okay so ios
11:54 - isn't gonna work because that's gonna
11:55 - need xcode
11:56 - okay that's fine let's forget about that
11:58 - then and let's just keep on building on
12:00 - top of this
12:01 - yeah but i mean we can get it running on
12:03 - the phone and that should be good so
12:05 - now we've got okay so it's got massive
12:08 - console log
12:09 - and then we've got okay
12:13 - check the render method of app okay so
12:15 - app 149.9 we have
12:19 - nice that worked okay
12:22 - so i added these two and it
12:25 - actually made a point awesome
12:29 - 9 000 plus 200 gives you 9 200
12:32 - and that point is
12:35 - um ten thousand
12:40 - six hundred odd to see
12:45 - why is that one yeah wait why is it hard
12:48 - to see
12:48 - should be pretty easy to see is it on
12:50 - e-cam it's kind of it's not as clear
12:52 - youtube is crystal
12:53 - um it's a bit difficult to see if you
12:56 - want me to keep it on ecam or do you
12:58 - want me to
12:59 - oh no that's good i've got now i've got
13:01 - a bigger screen so i can see it on
13:02 - youtube as well
13:03 - got it okay nice um
13:08 - share your 19 or where you're seeing
13:11 - that share that part
13:18 - okay share server there we go
13:27 - okay so pamela pamela says guys do you
13:29 - think that i can work full-time remote
13:31 - as a front end from romania
13:32 - how much can i make as a junior 100
13:35 - firstly yes you can
13:36 - work full-time remote regardless of
13:38 - where you're from
13:39 - um we have tons of students in the
13:41 - course who are doing that right now
13:43 - um and how much can i make as a junior
13:46 - that's really dependent on how much work
13:48 - you're willing to put in
13:49 - um you can make money as a freelancer as
13:51 - a teacher
13:52 - and land a job so you can make a hell of
13:55 - a lot of money as a junior developer it
13:56 - just depends on the amount of work that
13:58 - you're putting in
13:59 - um to sell yourself and make yourself
14:00 - valuable as a developer
14:05 - okay um dope dude should we jump in
14:09 - yeah let's do it so uh i've got the app
14:12 - problem running
14:14 - now as well awesome okay
14:18 - hey okay so now guys today we're going
14:20 - to be pretty much
14:21 - adding on react navigation so you know
14:24 - inside of an app how you've got like the
14:25 - different screens that you can kind of
14:27 - click through and things like that um
14:30 - we're going to show you how to implement
14:31 - that now a very popular one that i've
14:33 - used in the past
14:34 - is called react uh native navigation so
14:37 - react native navigation so cause you're
14:39 - gonna go ahead and google it
14:41 - yeah um and we're gonna pretty much be
14:43 - building this
14:44 - from fresh so this is not prepared it's
14:47 - fresh
14:48 - um me and kazi don't haven't done this
14:51 - before i haven't done this in a very
14:53 - long time so it's very fresh as well so
14:55 - we're going to run into bugs you guys
14:56 - are going to see how we overcome them
14:58 - and hopefully it'll bring you guys some
14:59 - value in doing that um
15:02 - yeah so react native navigation and
15:06 - what just happened why did my chrome
15:08 - just crash
15:12 - makes no sense all right so
15:15 - um i'm here the pretty link you see the
15:18 - one
15:18 - which underneath it yeah so not the
15:20 - github one yeah that one
15:21 - this one react navigation.org yep
15:26 - and then we've got so let's go ahead and
15:29 - click
15:30 - on uh redox and then let's just kind of
15:34 - follow the implementation and we'll get
15:35 - this thing built up
15:37 - so the first thing we're going to do is
15:39 - install
15:40 - react navigation native and we're going
15:42 - to this is for
15:43 - building navigations i imagine yeah
15:47 - so navigate so in react in typical react
15:50 - we use react router
15:52 - so that's what we're so familiar with
15:54 - everyone who's done the clones
15:55 - will know what react router is in in a
15:57 - native app obviously you don't just have
15:59 - pages
16:00 - you have actual sort of navigation you
16:02 - can actually tap through so imagine
16:04 - instagram
16:05 - when you're using instagram things like
16:06 - um you actually go into a separate
16:08 - screen right and then you can kind of
16:10 - click back and swipe back into that
16:11 - screen
16:12 - yeah um so we call that uh app
16:14 - navigation so in this case
16:16 - it's react navigation harsh says i made
16:18 - 1100
16:19 - project by just learning from your react
16:21 - js tutorial you made my career
16:24 - hey that's amazing that's awesome
16:29 - [Music]
16:32 - i love hearing success stories guys keep
16:34 - sharing them by the way if you have any
16:35 - more
16:36 - success stories or if you've made any
16:38 - income or anything from these videos
16:40 - um it's actually quite a common thing
16:42 - that we're we're quite familiar with now
16:44 - so let's still
16:45 - okay so that's import that's done right
16:48 - yeah okay nice so the next one
16:52 - installing dependencies into an expo
16:55 - okay so i think we actually needed that
16:57 - one
16:57 - um um
17:01 - really all right yeah so copy that
17:03 - second line expo install
17:05 - um it's good it's cool we just we just
17:08 - keep
17:08 - keep the files when we want but paste it
17:13 - yeah so copy that one and paste that one
17:15 - so you see the second one it says expo
17:16 - install uh-huh i just did it
17:19 - nice and then you can now continue
17:22 - uh to hello react navigation to start
17:25 - writing some code so go ahead and click
17:26 - on that little
17:27 - pub link
17:32 - okay so the way it works in
17:36 - react native is you have something
17:38 - called a stack
17:39 - navigator from what i remember as well
17:41 - so basically stacks are like
17:43 - imagine you push things onto the stack
17:46 - and then when you swipe back
17:47 - so imagine like when you swipe back on
17:49 - an app it pops from the stack
17:51 - and then when you like click onto a new
17:53 - page it pushes onto a stack
17:55 - so imagine like an array or like a list
17:57 - you're basically just pushing screens
17:58 - onto this stack
17:59 - and then that way it can come on let's
18:01 - let's visualize it so
18:03 - i can follow with you so okay so tell me
18:04 - what to draw
18:06 - so imagine like an array okay so i got
18:09 - an
18:09 - array yes yes like any kind of list
18:11 - right
18:12 - so imagine like the instagram home page
18:15 - so let's imagine we're on the instagram
18:17 - homepage let's just have that as an
18:19 - entry inside this array
18:20 - okay so so i'll just um
18:24 - all right got it so this is just a home
18:27 - so this would be the home right now
18:29 - imagine on instagram you know you have
18:31 - the the dms right you have the instagram
18:34 - dms
18:35 - yeah um the messages get sent right now
18:37 - imagine we tap the dms
18:39 - and then we pretty much go ahead and we
18:42 - push
18:43 - the dms page onto the stack
18:47 - okay i see right and now what this
18:50 - allows us to do is now
18:52 - on our app we're going to see the dms
18:54 - page which means that we get to
18:56 - we're on a dm's page yeah um but then
18:59 - imagine so on
19:00 - on apps you have that natural swipe back
19:03 - so you typically would go from the left
19:05 - side and
19:06 - swipe back right yes when you swipe back
19:09 - it'll take you to
19:10 - it'll take you from dms to home yeah
19:13 - because basically what you're going to
19:14 - do is you're going to
19:15 - pop from the stack which means pop the
19:18 - existing screen and you go back to the
19:20 - home screen
19:21 - got it right stack okay and then in this
19:25 - way
19:25 - imagine you're in your home dms and then
19:28 - you tap into a dm
19:29 - so like a message you see how it kind of
19:32 - stacks up
19:32 - right like it stacks up and then it
19:34 - basically you can pop
19:35 - every time you kind of swipe back it
19:37 - pops pops pops until you get back
19:39 - to where you want to go yeah now this is
19:42 - very similar to how
19:43 - react uh ru does it so
19:46 - when we built clones in the past you're
19:48 - pretty much just like redirecting then
19:50 - when you click the back button it goes
19:51 - back
19:52 - a page but now it's the native version
19:54 - so it's like stacks are used instead
19:56 - to sort of mimic that behavior right
19:58 - okay got it
19:59 - that's cool that's really cool okay yeah
20:02 - what kind of shot bloody i'm shocked i
20:04 - remember that because i haven't done
20:05 - this in a while um
20:07 - so what we're going to do is we're going
20:08 - to create a stack navigator
20:10 - all right and hopefully it's going to
20:12 - work first time
20:15 - and the stack navigator it says is a
20:17 - function that returns an object
20:18 - containing two properties screen and
20:20 - navigator
20:21 - both of them are react components for
20:22 - use for configuring a navigator so let's
20:24 - just go ahead and we'll cut this up
20:26 - we'll just play around with it and see
20:27 - cool so
20:29 - let's look at app.js so right now we
20:31 - have the entire app rendering in app.js
20:34 - right so it's going to be a bit
20:35 - difficult to actually go ahead and
20:37 - change any of this
20:39 - so what we could do is refactor this
20:43 - firstly into so this entire page
20:46 - is like a is a page inside of our app so
20:49 - what we're going to do is maybe make
20:50 - this the home
20:51 - page we'll make this we'll call this the
20:53 - home page right
20:54 - yeah so what we'll do is we're going to
20:56 - create a new component hold on let me
20:58 - yeah i'm following you cool
21:00 - yeah let's go ahead and create a new
21:01 - file called homepage.js
21:03 - and it's going to be capital h so
21:07 - homepage.js
21:10 - um go ahead and add a new file called
21:13 - homepage.json do you want me to do it
21:15 - yeah so that way they can see it so
21:17 - homepage.js nice
21:18 - and then we're going to use our neat
21:19 - little rfce trick
21:21 - to go ahead and get it there we go i'm
21:24 - going to change this to an arrow
21:25 - function so it's consistent
21:27 - but basically what we're going to do
21:29 - here
21:30 - is this is not going to be oh yeah oops
21:33 - yep
21:33 - this is now going to be the page that we
21:35 - want to render so what we're going to do
21:36 - is we're actually going to refactor
21:38 - all the code and what i mean by effect
21:39 - is that we're just moving it from app.js
21:41 - to
21:41 - this component okay and hopefully
21:44 - everything shouldn't break and it should
21:45 - be nice and work
21:46 - the way we want it to so what i'm going
21:48 - to do in a very nasty way is i'm going
21:50 - to basically go ahead and
21:51 - go inside of app.js so you need to
21:53 - follow me on
21:54 - on the code i think kazi all right here
21:57 - we go
22:00 - so i'm going to go ahead and just pretty
22:02 - much grab everything inside of app.js
22:05 - right now
22:06 - and i'm going to pretty much paste it
22:09 - inside
22:11 - page and we're going to fix any bugs
22:13 - that come up so
22:15 - i had an issue there and
22:18 - i had yeah
22:22 - yeah i believe nope let me go ahead and
22:25 - do that again that's
22:26 - bad bad copy so we want to go from the
22:28 - top of the file so
22:29 - const app and i'm going to go all the
22:31 - way down to the
22:33 - um the there we go
22:37 - so i'm going to get that and i'm
22:38 - basically going to go ahead and replace
22:40 - this
22:41 - there we go so now i have everything
22:43 - copied from
22:44 - the app.js into this one i'm going to
22:46 - even copy the styles
22:48 - and i'm going to pop that on top because
22:50 - it's a bit easier to actually read when
22:51 - we pop it on top
22:53 - and then i'm going to go back to our
22:54 - code and just literally grab all the
22:56 - same imports
22:59 - and paste them in here so we have
23:01 - everything pretty much that we have
23:02 - inside of
23:03 - app now inside of
23:06 - this new homepage.js okay yeah um so
23:09 - what we're going to do now
23:10 - is we're going to basically go ahead and
23:12 - clean this up so i'm going to go and
23:13 - actually
23:14 - remove all this code so it's just going
23:16 - to be const
23:17 - app and then all of the return we're
23:20 - going to have the safe area view
23:23 - but i'm going to remove the styles i'm
23:25 - just going to have it very very clean
23:28 - so i'm actually going to go ahead and
23:29 - remove all of these imports
23:32 - and remove the user effect and stuff
23:34 - like that
23:35 - and then here i'm going to say render
23:38 - the home page
23:39 - like that oops self closing so this
23:43 - should
23:44 - if we didn't break anything it should
23:45 - work so we have the same app
23:48 - yeah it's literally the same app now
23:50 - it's just rendering from so it's a safe
23:52 - area view is not defined okay
23:53 - so i need to uh just import it
23:57 - from react native so i'm gonna do that
24:00 - but i'm gonna get rid of all these extra
24:02 - ones that we don't need
24:05 - there we go save up and
24:08 - home page is not defined oh yep of
24:10 - course we need to import our homepage
24:12 - so we say import
24:16 - home page from home page
24:19 - like so oops
24:23 - my bad that was me no problem
24:26 - and then that should work now nice okay
24:30 - beautiful
24:30 - hey look at that yeah so this is
24:33 - typically how you want your act
24:34 - structured
24:35 - right so you wanted to have like a page
24:37 - and then you have the at the app
24:39 - now it looks really clean to read the
24:41 - code
24:42 - yeah it's clean right because now it's
24:44 - like inside of a safe area
24:46 - view we've pretty much just got the
24:47 - homepage which is dope like it's very
24:49 - clean
24:50 - that also means inside of homepage.js we
24:53 - don't actually need another
24:55 - safe area view so i think it's stopped
24:57 - following me
24:59 - some weird reason really okay there we
25:01 - go now i'm following you again
25:03 - so so here we have a safer review and
25:07 - then it's kind of nested it within
25:08 - another safe area of you here so
25:11 - this one now we can just change to a
25:13 - actual just a view
25:15 - um because we don't actually need the
25:17 - the two safe arrow views nested because
25:20 - this one is already wrapping
25:21 - the component inside of a sleeper review
25:24 - um not sure the danger of double
25:27 - wrapping it but we just don't we don't
25:29 - want to do that
25:30 - okay so that's pretty cool so we have
25:33 - that now so now it will make it easier
25:35 - to actually go ahead and implement
25:36 - implement
25:37 - react navigation you always want to make
25:39 - it your knife easier
25:40 - clean up the code and you see once you
25:42 - like it may have seemed like a big task
25:44 - but you see we just did it in less than
25:46 - five minutes yeah
25:48 - so now let's go back to the react
25:50 - navigation docs
25:53 - and kazi can you see how this is very
25:55 - similar to what we do with react
25:57 - rua so we get it to this clean stance
26:00 - and then we start to implement the sort
26:02 - of navigation part
26:03 - yes yeah so it's very very similar to
26:06 - like how we do it there
26:08 - and now in their example they've got the
26:11 - separate components they've got function
26:13 - home screen which is essentially what we
26:14 - just did
26:15 - yeah we built our home page yeah and now
26:18 - what we're going to do is we're going to
26:19 - grab the stack so we're going to say
26:22 - constant equals create stack navigator
26:24 - so i'm basically going to go ahead and
26:26 - pop that in actually i'm going to pop in
26:28 - on top here yeah and the stack navigator
26:31 - we need to import
26:32 - i'm going to import two things from
26:35 - that file you can see and that is the
26:37 - navigation container and create stack
26:39 - contain
26:40 - navigator and then we're going to
26:42 - surround our
26:43 - app inside so i'm actually just going to
26:46 - copy this block
26:47 - you know so i'm going to copy this block
26:49 - stack navigator i'm just going to nest
26:52 - it correctly and then the home page
26:54 - i'm going to cut our existing homepage
26:56 - so i'm going to comment this out for a
26:57 - second
26:58 - and then when it says name okay you're
27:01 - going to
27:01 - it allows you to give it a prop
27:04 - component
27:06 - yes and you just feed it the home page
27:08 - and then it knows what to do with it
27:10 - exactly that got it yeah dope see what
27:13 - we did there
27:13 - and you know you don't need the safe
27:15 - view right or do you need it because i
27:17 - assume that
27:19 - this should know how to make things safe
27:22 - no
27:22 - so it doesn't actually know how to make
27:24 - things safe but you're this brought up a
27:26 - good point so
27:27 - we actually previously before we don't
27:29 - want the safer review to be
27:30 - encapsulating the entire app
27:32 - we wanted to encapsulate the component
27:34 - itself
27:36 - um also td tdain blank this is live
27:39 - so yeah everything's live right now um
27:41 - so we're going to go ahead and change
27:43 - the
27:43 - we're going to add the safe area view
27:45 - back to the home page and remove it from
27:46 - here
27:47 - because it shouldn't be here it should
27:48 - actually be at the lower level
27:50 - so i'm going to go back to this preview
27:53 - this the view that we were
27:54 - i don't know why it keeps unfollowing me
27:56 - um
27:58 - go ahead and yeah so now
28:01 - let's go ahead and add the save review
28:03 - back here so save for a review
28:05 - and we can re-import save for review
28:09 - there we go and save it then then you're
28:11 - right we don't need it here
28:12 - so we can get rid of it like that oh you
28:16 - just added it to home page yeah added it
28:19 - to the home because you actually don't
28:20 - want it to be
28:21 - um because some imagine like you have a
28:24 - and the top and that header right
28:26 - the header in some apps actually goes
28:28 - into that safe area and you purposely
28:29 - want it to sometimes
28:31 - because it gives you like a full screen
28:33 - experience yeah
28:35 - yeah so it's in some situations you
28:37 - actually don't want the safe area view
28:38 - because you want it to kind of like be
28:40 - this seamless full screen experience
28:42 - got it yeah so that's cool
28:46 - now let's actually see if we broke
28:48 - anything so it says cannot resolve react
28:50 - navigation
28:50 - stack um so we actually need to
28:53 - uh and we need to install that it looks
28:56 - like oh yeah
28:57 - so installing the stack navigator
28:59 - library we didn't do that
29:00 - so we need to do if you scroll up on the
29:02 - docks it says
29:04 - npm install react navigate yet we need
29:07 - to just pop that into terminal
29:10 - shashank said he says how to learn if i
29:12 - don't even know the basics
29:14 - um so i would recommend literally
29:16 - there's so much free content out there
29:18 - to learn html css javascript
29:20 - you can pretty much go ahead and watch
29:22 - that stuff and then follow with the
29:23 - lives
29:24 - we offer a course called profit with
29:26 - javascript um
29:27 - and that you can pretty much you don't
29:29 - have to have any experience you can
29:30 - pretty much go ahead and join that
29:31 - that's literally cleverprogrammer.com
29:33 - pwj if you're interested
29:35 - um and yeah like and then pretty much
29:37 - you can go ahead and just
29:39 - jump in and you don't need any
29:41 - experience
29:42 - to go ahead and to learn that and you
29:44 - can pretty much go ahead and get running
29:45 - to the point that we're at right now
29:48 - yep so this is the course you can go
29:50 - check it out here's the link and it
29:52 - should also be in the description below
29:54 - and feel free to check it out yeah go
29:56 - ahead and check that out
29:59 - dope all right so we got this going
30:02 - and it should be installed so let's dude
30:05 - it works
30:06 - nice wait what happened it did have a
30:09 - little bit oh
30:10 - [ __ ] i see the home screen at the top
30:13 - that's cool man that's that's super cool
30:16 - damn okay dope that would be excited
30:19 - holy [ __ ] all right now let's
30:23 - um let's figure out how to do our first
30:25 - kind of
30:26 - stack stacked item so
30:29 - we can see now we're on the home screen
30:32 - i think it would look different on the
30:33 - app as well i think it would be in the
30:34 - middle
30:35 - so it would be like native looking i'm
30:37 - trying to build it on my phone but
30:40 - for whatever reason i just cannot get my
30:42 - phone to compile it
30:43 - properly maybe turn it off tunnel mode
30:46 - do it local and it'll be faster for you
30:49 - and then just share your phone on the
30:50 - screen that might be the easiest way i
30:53 - think so not
30:54 - land local yeah do uh do local
31:00 - oh maybe lan because your phone's
31:02 - connected to your wi-fi
31:04 - otherwise you i think you have to be
31:05 - plugged in i'm not sure all right all
31:07 - right
31:08 - yeah try that all right i'm gonna try
31:10 - lan
31:13 - usually on lan and local it freaking
31:16 - poops out it's giving me
31:20 - nothing it's just like empty blank
31:22 - screen i'll try again
31:24 - yeah boom
31:27 - empty black screen cool let's go tunnel
31:31 - cena
31:32 - sure says you guys should teach us how
31:34 - to market our services to land clients
31:36 - we actually do all of that in pwj we
31:38 - show you how to go ahead and make an
31:40 - income with skills you
31:41 - know when you learn um a lot of courses
31:44 - out there boot camps and stuff they'll
31:45 - teach you how to code but they don't
31:46 - tell you how to market yourself and
31:47 - actually show your value to everyone out
31:49 - there
31:50 - we pride ourselves around that approach
31:52 - as opposed to just
31:54 - being a developer because that's really
31:56 - where you make money so
31:57 - um we actually cover that in the course
31:59 - also we actually run tons of trainings
32:01 - and stuff like that which
32:02 - uh you can feel free to check out
32:04 - there's a bunch of if you go ahead and
32:05 - look at some of the old youtube videos
32:06 - there's a bunch of trainings that we run
32:08 - uh feel free to go ahead and dive out
32:10 - yeah check out all those trainings and
32:12 - we just put together a
32:14 - website called reactbrothers.com so
32:17 - yeah you can actually go there and uh
32:19 - check out what's going on too
32:22 - exactly and uh we put we'll we'll start
32:25 - putting together our
32:26 - like top tutorials on there so yeah
32:29 - you can feel free to check it out and
32:32 - we'll put all our like big react js
32:34 - builds all in one place
32:36 - exactly literally endless value for you
32:38 - guys yeah
32:40 - value every day yeah so we're right now
32:42 - what we're doing is we're going to do a
32:43 - few streams where we're also learning
32:45 - with you like react native
32:47 - and then we're going to do a stream
32:48 - where we're just like building a project
32:51 - and then going all out on it and i think
32:54 - by this week we'll crack the code
32:56 - for sure on twitch and uh we'll be
32:58 - streaming on twitch
33:00 - as well and the streaming experience is
33:02 - going to get a lot a lot better
33:04 - yeah we've got upgrades because like
33:06 - what i'm excited about sunny is i want
33:08 - to put it in 60 frame rates per second
33:10 - so then it has that like
33:12 - silky buttery feel to it
33:15 - but are you smooth exactly yeah
33:18 - oh yeah dude are you getting are you
33:20 - stocking up on toilet paper
33:23 - oh yeah so guys it's locked down too in
33:26 - in uk
33:28 - so um surprisingly i went into my into
33:30 - my sort of like into the side room
33:32 - and we had like bundles of toilet rolls
33:35 - so i think
33:36 - my mom already did that holy [ __ ]
33:38 - everything pretty much yeah
33:39 - let's see lockdown lock down
33:43 - in us start nate let's see if there's
33:46 - another uh
33:47 - one coming soon
33:50 - um i don't see another lockdown coming
33:53 - soon
33:54 - but i feel like it's gonna it's gonna
33:56 - happen very very soon
33:58 - super annoying dude even the gym closes
34:01 - boris johnson imposes stay at home order
34:04 - as cases surge
34:06 - you know crazy man how
34:09 - how like what is happening with
34:11 - coronavirus right now like what's the
34:13 - growth rate as we speak because
34:16 - it's been a while whoa it like slowed
34:18 - down yeah it like
34:20 - peaked and then it came down and now
34:22 - it's kind of like on its second wave up
34:25 - it's like done with its launch yeah
34:27 - literally
34:29 - um okay let's do show all oh no no no
34:33 - it's not down bro look at that
34:35 - yeah across the u.s u.s is quite crazy
34:38 - dude like
34:40 - there is like if you check out uk uk has
34:43 - done pretty decent job of containing
34:45 - worldwide we're
34:46 - like spreading faster than ever
34:50 - how many people are there aren't we
34:53 - gonna run out of people soon to in fact
34:56 - how many people does it say in fact i
34:58 - can't read that 552
35:00 - 000 new cases a day bro holy [ __ ]
35:03 - like it was i remember when i used to
35:05 - track it i had this excel sheet
35:08 - and i would like manually log it and i
35:10 - started creating projections and it was
35:11 - at
35:12 - i think in march and i was like okay 2
35:15 - 200 4 000 new cases 6 000 new cases 13
35:19 - 000 new cases and now check it out bro
35:23 - 552 000 new cases
35:26 - it's insane man that's kind of nuts but
35:29 - deaths have seemed to be around the same
35:34 - yes it's strange right like uh and then
35:36 - but then there's only recorded deaths
35:39 - so that's another thing that's by
35:42 - coronavirus
35:43 - wow um
35:47 - all right i better get out of here
35:49 - because before i go down uh
35:51 - coronavirus rabbit hole by the way the
35:54 - stream is so clear on youtube right now
35:57 - is crystal like i'm just looking at you
35:59 - know it's nice guys go ahead and smash
36:01 - the thumbs up button because literally
36:03 - the stream right now looks so good
36:04 - on youtube i'm just checking out does it
36:06 - look better than normal
36:08 - yeah i mean like it's the clearest i've
36:09 - ever seen it like definitely
36:12 - yeah and that has to do with this beast
36:15 - beastly imac pro let's check out the
36:17 - specs and see what's happening
36:20 - um
36:23 - physical memory is gigs 37.
36:27 - yeah i stop menu too is that an app
36:31 - uh it's like a yeah it's like a one the
36:33 - one one of those apps that live in the
36:35 - top of the
36:36 - sort of you know the helper thing i
36:37 - don't think it's i think you have to
36:38 - download it off the website
36:40 - oh no it might be here it might be i
36:41 - start typing i start
36:43 - yeah i start menu this is the one dude i
36:46 - don't know man it looks like garbage
36:48 - what are you doing with this it's like
36:50 - it's like this one it's the best uh
36:52 - sort of app to tell you about yours wait
36:54 - is it this one no it's not this one
36:56 - this one looks better this one does not
36:58 - look best [ __ ] 3.7
37:01 - i don't know i don't think i got it from
37:03 - app store but it's so handy because the
37:06 - only app that like actually shows me
37:07 - what's going on in a glance
37:09 - ah i see so i can see my gpu i can see
37:13 - my
37:13 - my even my hard drives uh my upload
37:16 - download speeds i can see everything in
37:18 - one go
37:19 - oh [ __ ] all right i'm gonna just uh buy
37:21 - this and then uh
37:23 - right now oh you're using that one yeah
37:26 - uh
37:26 - you know what i i don't need this right
37:28 - now i don't need to make an impulse buy
37:30 - because of you um
37:33 - i just need to check stop going the
37:36 - thumbs up we're going crazy
37:37 - really guys go ahead did does anyone use
37:41 - istat mini 2 by the way
37:42 - in the comments because it is dope man
37:45 - oh people are like definitely clearer oh
37:47 - interesting
37:48 - solo says bye bye video monetization
37:51 - yeah seriously
37:52 - i talked about chronovirus for so long
37:54 - this video is gonna vanish
37:56 - oh yeah [ __ ] um actually yeah i think
38:00 - it's because of this
38:01 - wait till i put up um
38:06 - obs and then i'll max it out on bitrate
38:08 - and [ __ ]
38:09 - like it's gonna be dialed in dude it's
38:11 - gonna look so good
38:13 - yeah i mean dude that right now is i
38:16 - can't believe how clear it is right now
38:17 - like yeah
38:18 - i could see everything it wasn't an
38:20 - internet problem it was literally a
38:21 - processing problem
38:23 - because yeah processing even i upgraded
38:25 - my mac
38:26 - um then my streams got better when i do
38:28 - solo streams so this i mean imac pro is
38:30 - going to be
38:31 - super like able to do everything how
38:33 - much memory do people have on their
38:35 - computers
38:35 - like people don't have 128 gig right
38:38 - or or ram yeah ram no no no
38:42 - all right yeah definitely no i forgot
38:45 - how much is a
38:46 - normal ram i lost since uh my macbook
38:49 - has 32 gigs
38:50 - okay cool cool yeah like look it says 37
38:54 - are used so that's why my other computer
38:56 - would be just
38:57 - dead right now yeah
39:00 - exactly so uh it's it is
39:03 - easily worth the investment yeah people
39:06 - are like yo this is awesome
39:08 - yeah like look at how fast this is bro
39:10 - oh
39:12 - [Laughter]
39:16 - all right cool so we're talking about
39:18 - stacks
39:20 - stacks so now we want to go ahead
39:23 - and add a second stack
39:27 - so we've got the home screen which is
39:29 - looking good we have this stack dot
39:31 - screen
39:32 - um over here yeah so we want to go ahead
39:34 - and actually
39:35 - create a second stack and then let's go
39:37 - ahead and call this one
39:39 - um let's just call this like details for
39:42 - now right so it's just like a
39:43 - we're going to call it a details page or
39:45 - i mean what's a nice
39:46 - second screen let's just call it
39:48 - messages or something yeah yeah
39:50 - [ __ ] details details and then this
39:54 - let's go ahead and create a new file
39:55 - called uh
39:57 - messages.js which is just going to be a
39:59 - message screen uh-huh
40:00 - okay so i'll do that hold on let me
40:03 - actually uh pop
40:04 - in something real quick on my uh
40:09 - preferences let's go
40:12 - uh display
40:17 - i just want to drop a little
40:20 - under scan because wait
40:24 - is that happening under scan
40:28 - oh yeah why can't i throw a
40:31 - um
40:34 - oh no i can throw under the skin
40:40 - all right just want to do that
40:44 - just because things weren't like full on
40:48 - the screen
40:52 - really yeah now it should be even more
40:55 - crisp
40:55 - for people watching oh damn yeah
41:00 - oh bloody oh you guys like that is
41:02 - crystal for you guys
41:06 - yeah i just needed to throw a little uh
41:08 - a little under scan you know
41:11 - i'm not even going to pretend i have no
41:12 - idea what underscore me
41:14 - yeah when you have a tv so i'm on a
41:18 - giant tv right now a problem that
41:20 - happens is like you see all this space
41:22 - here
41:23 - oh yeah it's like above the screen so i
41:26 - don't
41:27 - even have access to it it doesn't even
41:28 - fit into the screen
41:30 - oh really yeah so i have to throw under
41:32 - scan to like
41:34 - make the screen shrink in size
41:37 - usually i just do aspect ratio on the tv
41:40 - remote
41:41 - to that 16x9 damn sonny
41:50 - back to react holy [ __ ]
41:54 - all right second stack
41:57 - is let's go ahead and create messages.js
42:00 - and this is going to be like a messages
42:02 - screen right so why don't we create a
42:06 - admin dashboard where we can see
42:08 - everybody's income that
42:10 - has logged it okay we could do that so
42:13 - should we do
42:14 - um so this is the home page so what
42:17 - would this what would a second page be
42:19 - let's go ahead and create like i said oh
42:20 - we could do like
42:21 - i mean a lot page um
42:25 - a login page yeah the login page is good
42:27 - yeah let's do login page because we're
42:28 - eventually going to have a
42:30 - some kind of room for that so login
42:32 - page.js here
42:34 - so and then for the name of the page
42:36 - we're going to call it login
42:38 - and for the component we're going to go
42:40 - ahead and say
42:42 - so login page we're now in login page
42:44 - we're gonna do a nice little rfce trick
42:47 - and this is the beautiful thing it's
42:48 - literally the same as what we've done
42:49 - before guys it's the same reactor we all
42:51 - know and love
42:53 - and you can just do that and it's not a
42:55 - div so remember oh damn actually
42:58 - oh yeah we actually changed that so it's
43:00 - not a div it's uh so rather than rfce
43:03 - we're gonna do our
43:04 - rn yeah what is it rnfc
43:08 - rnfe yeah
43:12 - react native functional something
43:15 - export yeah so and then we're here we're
43:18 - going to say i
43:19 - am the login page right
43:22 - yeah and then sunny i'll be right back
43:25 - okay
43:26 - okay so we're gonna do that and then
43:29 - here we need to just go ahead and say
43:30 - login
43:31 - page and we need to do an import so i'm
43:34 - gonna go ahead and say
43:37 - import and a little trick for you guys
43:39 - if you go ahead and highlight
43:41 - what you want to go ahead and sort of
43:43 - like select on the screen
43:44 - but you do command d you see i've got
43:46 - double cursors now
43:48 - which is dope so now i can actually go
43:50 - ahead and do login page which is pretty
43:52 - sick
43:52 - and it helps you you get very quick at
43:54 - doing that um and
43:56 - and it really does i use that all the
43:58 - time so if you guys didn't know that
44:00 - and you actually found that useful smash
44:02 - the thumbs up button because that's
44:04 - always gonna
44:04 - help you guys out uh ammar rozak says
44:07 - login
44:08 - firebase oh yeah we're going to be doing
44:10 - that
44:11 - um there's actually a really cool
44:13 - library uh i think it's called react
44:15 - native firebase so react native
44:18 - firebase you guys can't see this right
44:19 - now because it's on a different screen
44:20 - but yeah reacting to firebase.io
44:23 - and basically what they did is they went
44:24 - ahead and done all the hard work to go
44:26 - ahead and
44:27 - handle the sort of like using react
44:30 - native and firebase together so
44:33 - so we've got firestore cloud functions
44:36 - cloud messaging
44:37 - guys if you thought firestore was a
44:39 - firebase was jacked for
44:41 - for web apps wait until you see for uh
44:44 - react native apps you can do so much
44:47 - stuff it's crazy
44:48 - and guys if you want to see machine
44:51 - learning
44:52 - that's going to be cool because machine
44:53 - learning so you can use things like i'm
44:55 - going to go ahead and i'm just listing
44:56 - out what i'm i can see on my screen
44:58 - so it's ml kit vision so you can use
45:00 - text recognition landmark recognition
45:02 - barcode scaling
45:03 - scanning image labeling and face
45:05 - detection
45:06 - all of the uh yeah so all of that stuff
45:10 - you can do remote config performance
45:11 - monitoring
45:12 - natural language processing which is
45:14 - bloody sick so
45:16 - um cena sure i said sunny don't you
45:18 - think firebase is a bit slow
45:21 - what how firebase is so
45:24 - fast dude like um i don't know if it's
45:28 - if it's i can't see the thumbnail but
45:29 - yeah firebase is insane
45:31 - honestly firebase is like a it's it's
45:33 - insanely fast
45:35 - uh in terms of the server availability
45:37 - and stuff like that firebase is on fire
45:38 - guys so no
45:40 - i think it is extremely performant um
45:43 - and chances are they do a lot better
45:45 - than we would do it
45:46 - uh if we were manually doing it so
45:48 - firebase is extremely powerful guys
45:51 - um bob builder says bro you guys should
45:54 - do something in machine learning that
45:55 - would be so sick 100
45:57 - aaron actually did drop something i did
45:58 - a video with aaron even before
46:00 - so if you're interested in some machine
46:02 - learning videos we've dropped someone
46:03 - before on clever programmer but
46:05 - it'll be pretty cool to go ahead and
46:07 - actually have
46:09 - um react native with machine learning i
46:12 - think that would be sick
46:13 - so if you guys want to see that smash
46:15 - thumbs up and we can get that moving
46:17 - uh james gail says more shortcuts please
46:20 - i will show you some shortcuts in a sec
46:22 - uh seen the sugar i say up and every
46:24 - request takes like two seconds most
46:25 - likely either a
46:26 - your network connection or b the way
46:29 - you're sending your requests is
46:30 - non-performance so you need to look into
46:32 - it could be either those things but
46:34 - trust me it is lightning fast
46:36 - kkpk says what's better for making a
46:38 - website react or
46:40 - django my opinion react uh this is why
46:44 - is the number one most wanted language
46:46 - right now
46:47 - um according to stack overflow survey
46:49 - and for good reason
46:51 - uh okay so bubbles i've been seeing
46:54 - stuff in the internet saying firebase
46:55 - sucks like querying stuff do you think
46:57 - that's true
46:58 - remember guys there's this okay you can
47:01 - either get
47:01 - sucked into the world of opinionated
47:04 - sort of like
47:05 - what is better this sucks that framework
47:07 - sucks or you can just suck it up
47:10 - look at the facts and the fact is it's
47:12 - the number one most wanted language
47:15 - and just become so damn amazing with it
47:18 - right so that's what i would say focus
47:20 - on that because
47:22 - most people i see is like yeah you know
47:23 - like it's not performing and stuff
47:25 - guys like stop wasting time it's an
47:28 - excuse
47:29 - by doing that you're literally giving
47:30 - yourself an excuse to not progress so
47:33 - make sure you just just forget all that
47:34 - stuff just start coding and
47:36 - trust me you can make a ton of money off
47:39 - of
47:40 - this stuff so i would say go ahead and
47:42 - do that so
47:44 - uh we've got seahan says tell me what
47:46 - the dismantler is using randy of web
47:47 - apps
47:48 - instead of react.js um disadvantages
47:52 - deployments are slower you're going to
47:53 - have to approve your app to deploy on
47:55 - the app store that's going to take time
47:57 - whereas react you can just do a quick
47:58 - deployment um
48:00 - but you get all the native features so
48:03 - it depends if you want to put in the
48:04 - work to build a renegade app you
48:05 - actually can have a lot more power
48:06 - including notifications so that's a big
48:08 - one
48:09 - um yeah arabroski dope
48:12 - so what are we doing right now react
48:14 - native firebase stuff so
48:17 - um dude i think as well it would be a
48:20 - killer video to do machine learning
48:23 - and react native oh yeah i would want to
48:26 - do machine learning
48:27 - and react but we could do it with react
48:29 - native too
48:31 - yeah because uh firebase have a ton of
48:34 - really powerful
48:35 - libraries with react native um so
48:38 - so that would be yeah for machine
48:41 - learning sorry
48:41 - yeah i think like tensorflow or
48:43 - something along those lines would be
48:45 - sick i
48:45 - always wanted to uh also do chess with
48:49 - react make a chess game
48:51 - oh [ __ ] i'll be sick yeah
48:55 - all right bro so um what's going on here
48:58 - so like we
48:59 - we're trying to add the next page which
49:01 - is going to be login page right
49:03 - yes so look it's showing up at the top
49:06 - in the
49:07 - navigation yeah so we have to set all
49:09 - that up so right now
49:11 - we actually have um
49:15 - okay so right now this is just setting
49:17 - things up so one thing we can also do
49:19 - while we're here at this point
49:20 - is we can say we can actually pass an
49:22 - additional prop so for the login page
49:25 - if we wanted the title of the login page
49:27 - not to be login page or anything like
49:29 - that but we can go ahead and pass in an
49:31 - options
49:32 - and then what we do is that takes an
49:34 - object and that object takes a title
49:36 - and inside that title you can go ahead
49:38 - and say login or you can say login
49:40 - screen i mean nobody sees login screen
49:43 - you can just say sign in or sign up sign
49:44 - in
49:45 - or sign up let's do that sign in or sign
49:47 - up
49:48 - right uh something like that just to
49:50 - make it very clear that that's actually
49:52 - we're going to see
49:53 - so we've set up the screens right now
49:54 - okay we've got these routes we've got
49:56 - the home screen the title screen and
49:57 - things like that
49:58 - the initial route you can actually go
50:00 - ahead and pass in so right now it's just
50:02 - by default grabbing the first one
50:04 - but you can actually go ahead and add
50:05 - this in so it says initial route name
50:07 - home
50:08 - if you wanted the initial route name on
50:09 - login we should let's try that actually
50:11 - let's save it and let's see if it
50:13 - uh takes us to the whoa there we go
50:16 - nice yeah so you can see we have rooting
50:20 - we have some kind of rooting in the app
50:22 - you know yep um and then what we're
50:25 - going to do is we're going to change
50:26 - up back to home but now we're ready to
50:28 - go to the next step
50:30 - which is um so
50:33 - usually i contact us and use a render
50:36 - callback
50:37 - um okay so now we're going to do is go
50:38 - to the next step so if you
50:40 - go to um back to the docs
50:45 - and go to uh
50:48 - where if you scroll down it'll say
50:50 - what's next and uh
50:52 - they should have a next section button
50:54 - so what's next
50:56 - moving between screens there we go yeah
51:00 - all right so yeah so you can see that
51:03 - that's typically how we do it on a react
51:05 - app so it's no no no sorry that's not a
51:07 - reactive that's a typical web app
51:08 - no a typical web page right so no react
51:12 - app we use link
51:14 - in um but in the normal web page we have
51:16 - it says on pratt
51:17 - on press so navigating to a new screen
51:20 - would look like on press
51:22 - navigation.navigate um login page
51:25 - yeah so the key here is actually that
51:28 - navigation.navigate
51:29 - yep right that button is just medium you
51:32 - can
51:32 - and at any point in your code you can
51:34 - call that navigate uh sort of piece of
51:36 - code
51:37 - yeah but here we'll do the same exam
51:38 - we'll have a button which says like go
51:40 - to login or whatever like that
51:42 - so on our home page
51:45 - let's go down to the the sort of let's
51:48 - add a
51:48 - where we have let's build a react native
51:50 - app let's actually have a button
51:52 - so i'm going to go ahead and add a
51:54 - button and remember their buttons are
51:56 - actually weird they're self
51:57 - closing and then they have a title prop
52:00 - yeah so
52:01 - let's just say go to let's just say
52:04 - login a button called login and then
52:07 - we'll have an on press
52:10 - and the on press would go ahead and it's
52:12 - an arrow function
52:13 - so it's going to be like an inline code
52:15 - or you can actually call a separate
52:16 - function so it's typically how we know
52:19 - and do it and react
52:20 - we're going to say navigation dot
52:23 - navigate
52:24 - and then this would typically be the
52:27 - name so if you remember we set the name
52:29 - of this one as
52:30 - home and the name of this one is login
52:32 - so that's what we're going to navigate
52:33 - to so in this case we're going to
52:35 - navigate to login
52:36 - where'd you get the preload manager from
52:38 - what is this
52:39 - oh no that's that's that was wrong that
52:41 - that just autofilled
52:42 - it should be navigation like what did i
52:45 - miss
52:48 - that should be navigation yeah and then
52:50 - what we need to do is
52:51 - actually import um okay so this is
52:54 - another clever thing
52:56 - um so it actually gets passed down
53:01 - as a prop so
53:04 - uh if we go ahead and i remember this
53:06 - now so if we go back to the top of home
53:08 - page
53:09 - so remember guys this is where the props
53:10 - come in right in react apps you have a
53:12 - component and it can
53:14 - accept some props now whenever you've
53:16 - got
53:17 - a stack inside of this sort of
53:20 - a chart which is a child of this
53:21 - navigator inside of this navigate
53:23 - container
53:24 - all of these chart components actually
53:25 - get a prop and that prop if we
53:28 - destructure it
53:29 - it's going to have whatever props you
53:30 - pass in normally as well
53:33 - as something called navigation okay and
53:36 - this is basically like a navigation
53:37 - handler that comes down
53:39 - so this is how we can go ahead and do
53:41 - navigations.navigate
53:43 - login so at this point we should
53:47 - um see let's go ahead and see
53:51 - inside of our app right now i'm seeing a
53:53 - login button
53:54 - if i click it oh dope dude oh [ __ ] okay
53:58 - go to um
54:00 - i see it login and boom oh [ __ ] that's
54:03 - clean nice
54:06 - that's slick that is even see by default
54:10 - it's putting it on the stack and then we
54:11 - can pop pretty much
54:13 - um damn that's pretty sick yeah
54:16 - they made it they made it a lot neater
54:18 - than it used to be
54:19 - um okay i did i'm loving coding and
54:23 - react native now
54:24 - because uh back in the day used to be a
54:26 - pain to do that
54:27 - really yeah it wasn't as clean uh before
54:30 - and now like everyone that comes to it's
54:32 - like oh this is super clean it's like
54:34 - you guys are getting the nice end of
54:36 - this which is cool yeah
54:38 - so navigate okay so navigate to a root
54:40 - multiple times
54:42 - let's go back to the docs and let's go
54:44 - ahead and check out
54:47 - okay so um
54:50 - so you can do a few things you can you
54:52 - can keep on you see there's
54:54 - navigation.push if we go down
54:56 - um there's this so you so basically
55:00 - navigate is the best one because
55:01 - navigate is very it's very clever
55:03 - if you try and navigate to the same
55:04 - screen twice it's not going to like
55:06 - stack up the same screen twice it will
55:08 - just stack it at once
55:09 - but if you go ahead and push twice it
55:12 - will push twice
55:12 - if you see that gif yeah it says and you
55:15 - see you can keep stacking the same page
55:17 - and in some situations you may need that
55:19 - so it's just worth knowing that you can
55:21 - do that um
55:22 - got it okay that's cool and then we've
55:25 - got the
55:26 - um so if we scroll down there's actually
55:29 - a you can actually have a button which
55:31 - navigates
55:31 - back so you can
55:36 - so by default yes it added it to the
55:38 - header
55:39 - but some apps you might notice that they
55:41 - don't use the default native stuff right
55:43 - they don't always cool
55:44 - that they do it for you that's kind of
55:47 - nice
55:48 - yeah so they do it for you but if you
55:50 - wanted it like programmatically as part
55:52 - of your component
55:53 - um so let's actually try this out let's
55:55 - go ahead and into our code let's go to
55:57 - the login page and let's add a button
56:01 - here with a title which says
56:04 - go to home page oh no just to say go
56:07 - back
56:08 - right go back and then here we'll say on
56:10 - press is going to be
56:12 - an arrow function which is going to do
56:14 - and remember we need to get our
56:16 - props when we destructure him we say get
56:18 - the navigation
56:20 - and then here we say navigation dot
56:24 - go back like that
56:27 - and that should what
56:30 - where is this coming from oh we're
56:33 - giving it to it on the app.js
56:36 - yeah so remember because it's a child of
56:38 - these two things
56:39 - it's like a these are basically like
56:42 - called higher order components so they
56:43 - basically
56:44 - inject a prop into its children which is
56:46 - navigation
56:48 - oh okay yes the way to think of it is
56:51 - just because they're like children
56:52 - of these so navigation container and
56:54 - this stacked navigator
56:55 - and because they're inside of it they by
56:58 - default are going to get that prop
57:00 - so but just think of it that way so they
57:01 - just they get that prop
57:03 - navigation right got it so we can so we
57:05 - can actually use that like that
57:07 - and now if we go to our
57:10 - uh our app we should see in the login
57:13 - page
57:13 - um we actually need to save app.js and
57:17 - log in
57:17 - login page it's not i think you have to
57:19 - save it yeah
57:21 - and even without.js all right i saved
57:24 - all of them
57:25 - that's bad now we should be able to see
57:29 - oh okay buttons not buttons not um
57:32 - defined so we need to define button and
57:35 - then save loginpage.js
57:38 - okay and then we refresh
57:41 - and now log in go back hey so now not
57:44 - only have we got in the header we've
57:45 - also got it
57:46 - as a programmatic file now come for me
57:48 - nothing is changing
57:50 - uh click login there we go huh you see
57:53 - it's got it go
57:54 - go back i see yeah
57:57 - nice right so now we can do it
57:59 - programmatically and we know that it
58:01 - also adds to the header by default so
58:03 - that's that header that gets attached
58:05 - right so now that header you can
58:07 - customize
58:08 - it you can make it look however you want
58:09 - you can even customize the icons that
58:11 - appear yeah also remember on the login
58:14 - screen
58:15 - it says sign in or sign up right so
58:17 - remember we actually added that
58:20 - as a prop here which was options so if
58:23 - you go to login screen
58:25 - so if you click on the login button you
58:27 - see at the top it says sign in or sign
58:29 - up yep and that's because we passed in
58:32 - this title prop
58:35 - got it yeah um so that's like you see
58:38 - like there's just
58:39 - different use cases of props but if in
58:41 - reality when you i know it's like
58:44 - it can be confusing because it's like
58:45 - it's just something new but in reality
58:47 - it's actually pretty
58:48 - pretty clean um in order to customize
58:50 - tiles and things like that
58:52 - once you set up your routes everything
58:54 - is pretty clean and you can imagine now
58:56 - you just code with react pretty much and
58:58 - you have rooting inside of your app
58:59 - yeah and by default this is going to
59:02 - support
59:02 - on android so android phones have a
59:04 - button which is always designated to go
59:07 - back
59:07 - right they have that kind of you know
59:09 - backwards carrier um
59:11 - that's going to do the pop functionality
59:12 - for them and on ios
59:14 - the swipe back is going to do that for
59:16 - you got it
59:18 - yeah so that's pretty cool so we have go
59:21 - back
59:23 - um okay so that's pretty much
59:26 - oh yeah i also know nas wants to learn
59:28 - um
59:29 - react native too actually oh really yeah
59:33 - he really wants to yeah so it will be
59:36 - ill it's something cool for you guys to
59:38 - attack too
59:39 - in some calls yeah yeah we should
59:41 - definitely do that i think even in the
59:43 - coaching calls it will be really cool to
59:45 - start attacking uh react native as well
59:48 - yeah um
59:49 - because it would be like a a circular
59:51 - thing would learn more in the cause
59:53 - it would come back on youtube we can do
59:54 - crazy builds um
59:57 - that'll be fun okay so next section
60:00 - is passing parameters to roots
60:04 - um okay so passing parameters to roots
60:08 - um i mean at this point we could
60:10 - actually implement a
60:11 - a bit of a flow to our app yeah
60:15 - we could actually have a login
60:17 - functionality at this point
60:18 - okay cool just trying to think
60:24 - we want to tackle i think we said
60:26 - something along the lines of last time
60:27 - like we wanted to tackle authentication
60:29 - today
60:30 - yeah so we could tackle authentication
60:32 - today okay so we've got the login page
60:34 - um so in that case what we can do is
60:38 - um go to react nate
60:42 - type in on google react native firebase
60:52 - yeah so this this uh uh sort of
60:56 - like library is actually a crazy library
60:58 - like i'm not sure who's built this like
61:00 - or like it's like a big team
61:02 - but they basically like adapted
61:04 - everything that firebase gives
61:06 - for react native and you can pretty much
61:07 - go ahead and use everything that react
61:09 - firebase offer but they have everything
61:12 - set up but you can see there's like
61:14 - a bunch of things that you can do and
61:16 - signing out and stuff like that
61:17 - now the reason is is that you might be
61:19 - wondering can't we just use the typical
61:20 - react way that we do it before
61:22 - but make sure you use that one the
61:24 - reason being is because they have
61:26 - very clever ways of listening to the
61:28 - login state
61:30 - which is different in an app you don't
61:31 - want it to kind of be glitchy and kind
61:33 - of like
61:33 - log in and then kind of every time you
61:35 - go on the app it kind of logs in and
61:36 - passes you over
61:37 - you want it to like cache the login and
61:39 - do things like that
61:41 - so um let's go ahead and install this
61:44 - into our project so if you go to the top
61:46 - installation um
61:47 - so installation i installed this um
61:50 - react native firebase app
61:52 - oh you did that yeah although okay so
61:56 - um react native firebase app okay cool
61:59 - and then
62:00 - what we need to do as well is if you're
62:03 - developing your app using ios
62:04 - run this command so we need to actually
62:07 - go ahead and
62:08 - and i mean we're not going to do that
62:10 - right now because we haven't got xcode
62:12 - installed
62:13 - but you would have to do cd ios because
62:15 - if you notice inside of um
62:18 - inside of a react native app you
62:19 - actually have a hidden folder called ios
62:22 - and then you you have to do this thing
62:23 - called pod install but we're not going
62:25 - to do that right now
62:27 - later um but what we're going to do now
62:29 - is it says listening to authentication
62:31 - state so remember on on the react clones
62:35 - where does it say that um so you have
62:39 - why does your one look different so your
62:40 - installation go down
62:44 - um oh sorry you're looking at a
62:48 - different you need to go to go up to the
62:50 - top sorry click on the little uh
62:51 - pull out uh burger menu uh-huh
62:55 - and then click on authentication usage
62:59 - oh but you know we should maybe actually
63:00 - get you getting started first
63:02 - yeah because we actually need to install
63:04 - the the course things
63:06 - um so yeah go back to what you where
63:08 - you're at sorry that's that's good idea
63:11 - um so yeah so you see
63:14 - there is a setup involved for android
63:17 - and there's a setup involved for
63:19 - um ios as well there's two separate
63:21 - things that we're going to have to do
63:23 - for those projects um
63:27 - configure file and you see you have to
63:29 - kind of run through these to set
63:31 - everything up it is a little bit kind of
63:34 - clunky but i would say maybe what we
63:35 - could do in this case is
63:39 - let me just check if we can maybe do it
63:41 - for
63:41 - [Music]
63:43 - because the the process for that won't
63:45 - be good to do now because of the xcode
63:47 - issue so let me just check on the
63:50 - authentication side
63:52 - i tell you what we could do kazi why
63:54 - don't we show them sort of a
63:56 - a coded example of a login that pushes
64:00 - them to
64:00 - so once you log in with the correct sort
64:02 - of you know hard-coded sure thing
64:05 - yeah yeah we could try that oh sugar
64:07 - show emily's in the chat
64:09 - oh [ __ ] hi baby
64:12 - let's go no
64:16 - oh she's at the boxing gym that's sick
64:20 - make sure you they get their recording
64:22 - really well what the [ __ ]
64:25 - we just got a 50 pound donation
64:28 - 50 euros yeah let's go
64:32 - by pika crazy go ahead and pull that on
64:35 - the screen yeah there we go
64:37 - and wow that thank you
64:40 - for all your work guys i added netflix
64:42 - whatsapp and amazon clone to my
64:44 - portfolio it helped me a lot to obtain a
64:46 - 40k
64:47 - euros a year long time contract as a
64:50 - full stack junior developer this is part
64:51 - of my first monthly pay thank you very
64:53 - much
64:56 - that's amazing that is insane well done
65:00 - that's awesome man oh [ __ ] that's
65:02 - awesome congratulations pika
65:04 - that is amazing wow
65:08 - thank you for the donation appreciate it
65:10 - yeah that's interesting
65:11 - hell yeah bro keep up that music
65:15 - that's insane i love seeing that dude
65:17 - like uh and 40 000 euros a year is
65:20 - actually not bad at all for a junior
65:22 - developer that's a really good salary to
65:23 - be honest as a junior so
65:25 - that's what it really is that's crazy
65:28 - um i was thinking yeah so maybe let's do
65:31 - it as
65:32 - we just have an input yeah we have it
65:36 - and then we have two inputs and then if
65:37 - they put the correct
65:39 - username and password so a very simple
65:42 - non-layered authentication and then what
65:44 - we can do is
65:45 - we'll run through a full setup of of
65:48 - this once we have everything set up
65:50 - um no so we don't run into it right so
65:54 - at this point let's go ahead and on the
65:56 - login page just let's have the input
65:58 - fields that we're going to need
66:01 - um so right now we had
66:05 - i'm just looking at the input fields
66:06 - that we did previously so input
66:08 - okay so text input is what we were
66:10 - looking for so what we're gonna do is on
66:12 - login page we're gonna have
66:14 - two text inputs we're gonna have text
66:16 - input
66:17 - text input and i don't want this right
66:19 - here so i'm going to go ahead and get
66:21 - rid of these in a sec
66:23 - so this is going to bug out if we save
66:25 - it so we're going to have a placeholder
66:26 - for this one
66:28 - the styles we don't have at this point
66:31 - um i'm gonna pull this forward
66:36 - right
66:39 - so we're gonna have text input the first
66:41 - one is gonna be
66:42 - the username right so it's gonna say
66:44 - enter
66:46 - a username or we'll just say
66:49 - enter your username and then here we'll
66:52 - say enter
66:53 - your password right
66:57 - and then i think they should have a
66:58 - simple form right now right
67:00 - what was that you're just making a
67:02 - simple form right now
67:04 - yeah simple form that's all we're doing
67:06 - right now so
67:07 - um we can go ahead and say
67:10 - for the stars we'll leave that for now
67:12 - and we're going to add two pieces of
67:14 - state
67:14 - so we're going to use the use state hook
67:18 - so we're going to say use state and then
67:20 - we're going to say
67:21 - const username oh god i hate windows our
67:25 - username
67:26 - and it's always like the most random
67:29 - thing that i could like ever come up
67:31 - with
67:31 - exactly like dude oh man you
67:34 - stay and then we'll say blank right and
67:37 - i'm going to copy this
67:39 - paste it go ahead and say password
67:42 - set password and then
67:46 - for here we're going to say the value of
67:47 - the first one is going to be the
67:48 - username
67:49 - and then when they change it it's going
67:51 - to get the text and it's going to set
67:52 - the username to the text
67:54 - and yeah dope dude do the same thing for
67:57 - that
68:00 - that's awesome
68:03 - that's what you call pair programming
68:05 - guys
68:07 - oh that's sick and
68:10 - now for the styles we're gonna actually
68:13 - go ahead and
68:14 - i'm gonna go ahead and create a style
68:16 - sheet at the top
68:18 - and for the input fields we don't have
68:20 - title text but for the input fields i'll
68:21 - keep it very simple
68:23 - and we'll go ahead and uncomment these
68:25 - out
68:26 - and we should at that point have
68:30 - what we need to get up and running so
68:33 - let me go ahead oh man my
68:35 - spacing's all messed up okay so boom
68:38 - boom boom
68:39 - there we go so save now it says style
68:42 - sheet dot create so we need a bunch of
68:44 - things from react native repetitive
68:47 - so let's go ahead and get the style
68:48 - sheet so i'm going to go here and say
68:50 - style sheet
68:51 - import we also need the text
68:54 - input that's going to bug out
68:58 - and then we if we go to login page it's
69:01 - there's another problem
69:02 - where we don't have the text input so
69:06 - i just imported that text input
69:10 - um we should have it now so it should be
69:13 - working though
69:16 - text we have login okay awesome
69:19 - so the border color is red right now
69:21 - which is a bit extreme let's just have
69:23 - standard black orders oops
69:26 - black and then save
69:31 - um yeah there you go and now it should
69:34 - be on that page to log in there we go
69:36 - so enter your username into your
69:37 - password um so the password right now
69:40 - isn't the correct type
69:41 - right so you see if we go to login and
69:43 - we start typing in the password field
69:45 - so click on login
69:50 - login yep so you'll notice when you
69:52 - start typing in password it doesn't hide
69:54 - the characters
69:55 - um so let's go ahead and check how we do
69:57 - that so type text input
70:00 - password type react native
70:03 - let's check how we do that so here
70:07 - we actually just need to change we need
70:10 - to make it
70:10 - secure text entry so we need to do
70:14 - uh it's actually weirdly enough like
70:16 - this
70:18 - yeah it'll be an actual thing like that
70:23 - secure text entry and i should there we
70:25 - go go ahead
70:27 - there we go that works
70:31 - hey nice
70:35 - so now instead of this button doing just
70:37 - a simple go back
70:39 - let's create a function called const
70:41 - login
70:42 - right this is going to be a basic arrow
70:44 - function
70:45 - and here on press we're just going to do
70:47 - a login right
70:49 - i'm going to say login now
70:52 - when we hit the login button we just
70:54 - want to basically go ahead and say
70:56 - if the username this is a very
70:59 - simple dummy example okay if the
71:01 - username is kazi
71:03 - and the password hell yeah
71:06 - and the password is say
71:09 - one two three four one two three four
71:12 - let's do admin
71:14 - one two three four admin no no no no no
71:16 - just admin that's gonna be too hard to
71:18 - remember
71:23 - it's just admin yeah yeah just admin bro
71:25 - that's
71:26 - my shoes here so if if the username is
71:29 - causing the password
71:30 - admin then what we're gonna do is we're
71:32 - just gonna allow them to navigate to the
71:34 - home screen so firstly
71:35 - to make our app super secure we're gonna
71:37 - go ahead and change the initial route to
71:39 - the login
71:40 - okay so the initial route is a login so
71:42 - you should end up there first and then
71:44 - the only way to get to the home page
71:46 - is if you log in so here we're going to
71:47 - say navigation
71:49 - navigation dot navigate
71:52 - to home if
71:56 - you have the correct username and
71:57 - password okay so
72:00 - and then rather than saying go back it
72:02 - should say login
72:04 - so now you can see a typical sort like
72:05 - kind of example
72:07 - uh flow for an app so we should be able
72:10 - to go ahead and see
72:12 - um if we go ahead and use like
72:15 - let's go ahead and say it what
72:19 - do oh snap
72:24 - that's awesome right what's that what is
72:26 - it is it
72:27 - because i put in the wrong password on
72:29 - purpose
72:30 - oh it did nice nice it worked hey
72:33 - there we go all right and you can see
72:36 - like and obviously there's things to
72:37 - consider like at that point you wouldn't
72:39 - want them to be able to go back you
72:41 - would
72:41 - we would have different sort of handling
72:43 - mechanisms for that
72:44 - but the main thing is that by using that
72:47 - authentication library
72:48 - what we would do is we'll combine this
72:51 - with something like the redux
72:53 - um sort of state management library that
72:55 - we talked about in previous builds
72:56 - we would have that working in in sort of
72:59 - partnership with that react
73:01 - native firebase library and then we
73:03 - would basically check
73:05 - when the user is inside their app if
73:07 - they're logged in now if they're not
73:08 - logged in for any reason or if they're
73:09 - logging expired or something
73:11 - we can kick them back out to the login
73:14 - page
73:15 - yeah otherwise we just bring them to
73:17 - this home page right
73:19 - and you can see with that it's actually
73:22 - pretty simple like you can see now we
73:23 - have a fully functional sort of style
73:25 - app
73:26 - with login with sort of um obviously it
73:29 - was a dummy login
73:30 - the reason why we didn't do that is
73:32 - because of the
73:34 - um oh god you see the comments
73:37 - somebody said no
73:41 - holy [ __ ] adrian i live in bmw
73:53 - [Music]
73:56 - i hope you're okay bro that is kind of
73:58 - nuts what's going on there
74:00 - like who's shooting the cops are
74:03 - shooting or just random people are
74:05 - shooting
74:06 - that's crazy man because in the uk we
74:08 - just the gun laws are so strict we never
74:10 - really
74:11 - if you hear about a gun it's like oh my
74:13 - god that's crazy man
74:15 - so i don't know how you guys over in the
74:17 - states and stuff have it because it's
74:18 - pretty loose over there with gun laws
74:20 - right
74:21 - um yeah i guess i mean i'm i'm not too
74:24 - familiar with
74:25 - laws in general but yeah definitely not
74:28 - familiar with gun laws
74:32 - um well just hopefully you're safe
74:35 - adrian
74:36 - i mean i would say call the police but
74:40 - it looks like they're
74:41 - actually in a [ __ ] gun fight right
74:43 - now outside the house
74:46 - yeah dude um
74:50 - okay
74:52 - [Laughter]
74:55 - uh neo wt says hey i ended the airbnb
74:58 - clone and i can say i learned a lot from
75:00 - that stream i would like thank you for
75:01 - the effort and wish you good luck with
75:03 - your programs don't do
75:04 - thank you was fun yeah
75:09 - um also guys let us know in the comments
75:11 - any kind of builds that you're
75:12 - interested in learning about
75:14 - so that we have a rough idea about what
75:16 - you want to build what you want to go
75:17 - ahead and see
75:18 - in future builds let us know um
75:24 - oh [ __ ] is that right now right now bro
75:28 - oh dumb
75:29 - [Music]
75:31 - holy [ __ ] holy [ __ ] this
75:36 - um this is like probably the most
75:39 - controversial live stream we've ever
75:41 - done
75:42 - yeah it's definitely getting demonetized
75:56 - [Music]
76:04 - sandeep dust says just spent eight hours
76:07 - yesterday making the facebook come from
76:08 - your channel
76:09 - and today seven hours making the twitter
76:12 - clone with firebase you guys rock
76:14 - that's crazy dude while you're on that
76:16 - spree
76:17 - try ahead and beat us to the next video
76:21 - and get the react native firebase
76:24 - library set up and running um
76:27 - and try and do like some kind of
76:29 - authentication with that before we drop
76:30 - the video
76:31 - yeah that would be a good challenge for
76:33 - everyone to actually go ahead and do
76:35 - um that would be awesome
76:38 - sick now i can't go back bro oh okay the
76:41 - only way through is to log in
76:43 - yeah got it yeah so that's what we kind
76:46 - of like we sort of like you know
76:47 - kind of uh protected against that um
76:51 - so that was a kind of a dummy login
76:53 - scenario and the reason being is because
76:54 - we haven't set up xcode
76:55 - and there's a bunch of xcode work that
76:57 - we need to do to get that installed
76:59 - um but once that's done what we can do
77:02 - is we'll get this out because now we're
77:03 - on the new
77:04 - imac so the next time we go live we'll
77:07 - actually have the simulator up and
77:09 - running so they'll be able to see dude
77:11 - how the simulator will be we'll be
77:13 - seeing it you know
77:14 - got it okay i'm sick
77:18 - um dude i want to get that book on um
77:21 - there's this book on something about
77:23 - resistance like
77:26 - um i hope i can find it it's supposed to
77:30 - be pretty sick i don't know i just
77:31 - thought about it right now
77:33 - like working through
77:36 - resistance um
77:41 - it's none of these
77:45 - not
77:48 - what was this for resistance it's a book
77:51 - i i think it kind of talks about
77:53 - like how to work through resistance so
77:55 - doing things that are really hard i just
77:57 - got inspired because i thought about it
77:58 - i'm like
77:59 - we're setting these goals like for
78:00 - example even you and i we have the
78:02 - workout goals where we want to hit
78:04 - 20 workouts or 30 workouts yeah and then
78:07 - we have the goals
78:08 - of okay 15 live streams and
78:12 - i want to actually train my brain on
78:15 - actually
78:15 - actively looking to work through
78:17 - resistance
78:19 - and this book is actually really great
78:21 - on this except
78:22 - i just can't think of its name
78:26 - damn does anyone know in the comments
78:27 - maybe the book he's talking about
78:31 - let us know or let us know any books
78:32 - that you guys find generally quite
78:34 - useful that
78:35 - have impacted you um
78:38 - right now i'm listening to think like a
78:41 - monk have you have you read that book by
78:42 - j
78:42 - shay i'm uh i'm reading that as well
78:45 - actually
78:46 - that's a really good book yeah but you
78:48 - know i
78:49 - after he got to the part about
78:51 - negativity then it got pretty generic so
78:52 - i just [ __ ] quit out of it
78:54 - i got bored like yeah it went it went a
78:56 - bit kind of
78:58 - down and then it comes back up in the
79:00 - later chapter the start was like really
79:02 - profound where he's like breath is all
79:04 - you have
79:05 - they teach you breathing even if you i'm
79:07 - like okay that's deep that was sick i
79:09 - felt a certain way then
79:11 - it got really like a dad talking to his
79:13 - son about naked negativity is bad you
79:16 - have
79:16 - complainers that complain and
79:18 - complaining is bad
79:19 - i'm like [ __ ] know that dude yeah i
79:22 - switched
79:23 - to uh uh i switched to 10x
79:27 - yeah yeah yeah like i got sick of that
79:29 - [ __ ] thing it was a bit soft and i
79:31 - was like i kind of need someone to slap
79:32 - me with some
79:35 - but brochures mean the breathing the
79:37 - breathing thing was actually really good
79:38 - uh that that was actually a kind of a
79:41 - gold little nugget
79:42 - in that book um kind of very easily
79:46 - overlooked
79:46 - but yeah like uh that was that's pretty
79:48 - bob builder says a book called profit
79:50 - with javascript
79:51 - has greatly helped me you guys should
79:52 - check it out nice
79:55 - holy [ __ ] that's a great book that's a
79:58 - great book man
80:00 - um however if i is it do the workbook
80:03 - why is it do the workbook by stephen
80:05 - pressfield
80:06 - um no not that one and i went through
80:09 - jordan peterson's 12 rules of life but i
80:12 - don't know just didn't do the trick for
80:13 - me
80:15 - and uh yeah ranbir says his books are
80:18 - david goggins was really good but they
80:20 - can't hurt me that was sick
80:22 - that was actually a lot of uh that
80:24 - helped help me
80:26 - go [ __ ] nuts oh yeah at the gym and i
80:29 - was doing pretty
80:30 - epic [ __ ] so that one was really good
80:33 - and uh right now what i'm reading
80:35 - is the one thing
80:38 - the one thing i actually bought the um
80:41 - atomic havocs
80:42 - atomic habits was a total game changer
80:44 - for me that one was huge
80:46 - i i heard you guys talk about it quite a
80:48 - lot so i grabbed that yeah that
80:50 - that really had an impact yeah exactly
80:52 - devon grace i just bought thing like a
80:54 - monk
80:54 - don't tell me i got over 10 already i
80:56 - honestly i think it's not a bad book i'd
80:58 - say give it a read
80:59 - um but like there is a bit after the
81:01 - negativity that does
81:02 - become a bit generic and then there is a
81:04 - bit where i find it picks up but like i
81:06 - would say give it give it a chance i
81:07 - won't say it's a waste
81:09 - no it's definitely yeah yeah like
81:11 - especially the start of it i felt was
81:13 - phenomenal like the start of it alone
81:16 - makes the book worth it so
81:18 - go through that hopefully that inspires
81:21 - you
81:22 - exactly books by ab adam badoush
81:26 - what to say when you talk to yourself
81:29 - um damn oh man
81:33 - yeah look i look in the mirror and i'm
81:35 - like
81:36 - bro you look jacked i have really good
81:39 - self-talk to be honest
81:41 - nice it's like affirmations right yeah
81:43 - but like i i
81:44 - honestly i'm not even thinking
81:45 - affirmations like i just have um
81:48 - i just don't a lot of people are really
81:51 - hard on themselves i'm not that hard on
81:53 - myself
81:53 - at all so like i usually don't have a
81:56 - really
81:57 - strong negative self-talk yeah
82:00 - um i would say i suffered the opposite
82:02 - i'm quite harsh on myself
82:04 - really yeah i would say i'm really kind
82:06 - of like you know like even if you're on
82:08 - a streak
82:09 - i kind of i'm always like attacking it's
82:12 - very hard to feel like
82:14 - [ __ ] oh just that's funny dude that's
82:17 - crazy
82:18 - i mean that's hard yeah that's why the
82:21 - um
82:21 - that's why that breathing thing was
82:22 - really good because because like when
82:24 - you get overwhelmed and stuff like you
82:26 - j says like the only thing you control
82:28 - like from the point that you're you're
82:30 - born to the point you die
82:31 - is your breath like it's with you
82:33 - throughout and
82:35 - it's true like when you're stressed out
82:36 - when you're anxious or anything just
82:38 - start breathing
82:39 - and and it really does like change like
82:42 - you know like just taking a few breaths
82:44 - can bring you present it can change
82:45 - everything in a second so
82:47 - that that was a bit of a game changer
82:49 - yeah that's true
82:51 - yeah that's crazy dude i i never
82:55 - understand why
82:57 - certain people's self-talk is really
82:59 - like
83:00 - like strong against themselves but
83:03 - most of the times when i'm watching
83:05 - something of myself or looking at i'm
83:07 - like
83:07 - yeah damn cool like you know
83:11 - i'll be like oh that's pretty cool nice
83:13 - job bro
83:14 - yeah i i feel like that with the youtube
83:18 - streams dude when i'm watching about the
83:19 - streams then i feel pretty good then i'm
83:21 - like yeah that's sick like when we're
83:22 - talking and stuff
83:24 - so that's a really healthy way of
83:26 - carrying on with that but you're gonna
83:27 - say something were you inside
83:29 - no i was just gonna add on to that
83:30 - because i feel that people are really
83:32 - hard on themselves which makes you
83:34 - less likely to improve to be honest yeah
83:37 - um but i think a good balance where if
83:41 - you can objectively look at it like
83:43 - i think when you start to look at
83:44 - yourself a lot on youtube like how you
83:46 - and i do a lot of videos we can watch it
83:49 - i think you get desensitized to yourself
83:51 - and you start becoming less cringed out
83:53 - by yourself
83:54 - so yeah it's 100 you know what i mean
83:57 - because you have this picture in your
84:00 - mind and
84:01 - then when you see yourself for the first
84:03 - few times like what the [ __ ] like i
84:04 - don't i'm not like that at all how i
84:07 - think i am in my head and then in
84:09 - reality
84:10 - i say this like really stupidly or i
84:13 - come off like a [ __ ] here when i say
84:15 - this and you go okay
84:17 - so in the start i was really harsh but
84:19 - then the more
84:20 - i now i'm like pretty desensitized to
84:22 - myself because i've seen myself so much
84:24 - so i can actually see it just like i see
84:25 - another person and usually when i see
84:27 - another person i'm not like
84:29 - really harsh on you know thinking about
84:31 - them i'm like oh it's cool it's another
84:32 - person doing their thing
84:34 - yeah it's it's so true i remember the
84:36 - first time i went live i was like
84:38 - oh it's so hard like it may sound like
84:41 - the simplest thing just be yourself but
84:43 - like being yourself
84:44 - on camera and on live streams and stuff
84:47 - that is actually really tricky and it
84:48 - just takes
84:49 - it takes repetition of you just kind of
84:52 - getting
84:52 - bored of caring about how you look and
84:55 - feel on
84:55 - camera that's funny yeah and then and
84:57 - then eventually your
84:59 - your true self comes out and that's what
85:00 - everyone attaches to
85:02 - they're just attached to you being you
85:04 - and and the only way you get that and
85:06 - most people and this is something i got
85:07 - stuck
85:07 - at i always thought like oh no it has to
85:09 - be perfect the lighting has to be
85:11 - perfect the camera
85:12 - has to be perfect and then you just like
85:14 - screw all that [ __ ]
85:15 - just do it and keep doing it and then it
85:19 - just
85:19 - overcomes you know like you don't then
85:21 - you get out of that rut that you get
85:23 - stuck in
85:25 - i agree i'm reading um deep emotional
85:28 - things with kazzy and sunny
85:30 - um i just read the comment but yeah
85:33 - i think that just going and getting used
85:35 - to it until it's not a new thing for
85:37 - your body that helps
85:39 - tremendously yeah and gypsum
85:42 - also guys if you didn't know me and kazi
85:44 - just set a new
85:45 - massive goal for live streams because
85:48 - you don't tell them
85:49 - yeah it's kind of a lot actually
85:52 - we are planning to hit a base goal
85:56 - of 12 live streams and
85:59 - a reach goal of 15 in november
86:03 - yeah and what's cool is we started off
86:06 - november really strong so we've already
86:08 - this is our second live stream
86:10 - yeah so two livestreams tonight yeah
86:14 - so so far i feel we're crushing it and
86:17 - if we just keep going at this dude
86:18 - we're i'm excited about getting on
86:20 - twitch dude that's what i'm excited
86:22 - about
86:23 - yeah because twitch is like native to us
86:25 - streaming and you know all of that stuff
86:28 - so i think we we could definitely tap in
86:31 - with twitch
86:32 - yeah and uh and also we're gonna be
86:34 - upgrading the stream like well we
86:36 - we've we've been wanting to dive into
86:39 - this thing
86:40 - right about creating the stream uh we're
86:42 - going to push ourselves
86:43 - and it's pretty much a case of like
86:45 - it'll be a fun interactive stream
86:47 - yeah it will be and i think what we'll
86:49 - do is the next time we
86:51 - plan to go live let's just do it then
86:54 - yeah
86:54 - so we'll just get on an hour earlier and
86:56 - then work on it
86:58 - yeah let's do that 100
87:01 - i'll be sick dope all right broski
87:04 - so we are at login and now what we're
87:07 - trying to do is get the login
87:09 - functionality to
87:10 - work so we put up a dummy login
87:12 - functionality and that seems like it's
87:14 - working and i'm able to log in
87:16 - so yeah that's pretty great i'm able to
87:19 - add my income and it actually
87:20 - shows it on the map that's also pretty
87:22 - cool yeah
87:24 - uh what's next for us we're a little bit
87:27 - stuck
87:27 - because ideally what we would have
87:30 - wanted to do
87:31 - is have it so we used
87:34 - firebase authentication um
87:37 - to go ahead and log us in and and cache
87:41 - that login
87:42 - and then we would store the information
87:44 - the reason being is
87:46 - we could do it with pure javascript but
87:48 - i would like to do it with
87:50 - um yeah so do you want to
87:53 - uh what do you want to do do you want to
87:56 - like
87:57 - do that work behind the scenes so then
87:59 - we figure it out like
88:01 - we can get started earlier next time and
88:04 - then just
88:05 - make it work ideal use case would be
88:07 - that okay
88:08 - cool yeah because then because what
88:10 - we're going to need we're going to need
88:11 - to crack that side of things
88:13 - cool and then get it all set up and
88:15 - stuff like that um i
88:16 - don't i think it would work if we did
88:18 - this way but the problem is that if we
88:20 - do it the way that we're previously
88:21 - doing it
88:22 - you're gonna get like a glitchy
88:23 - experience it's gonna be like
88:25 - you're gonna go into the app and then
88:26 - it's gonna like it's gonna
88:28 - make a request find out that you're
88:30 - logged in and then log you in
88:31 - you don't want that you want to kind of
88:32 - log you in cache it so that way when you
88:35 - come back to the app
88:36 - it knows you're logged in rather than
88:38 - doing that you know that kind of
88:39 - two second delay thing yep yeah cool
88:43 - so let's pick up next time then and wrap
88:45 - it up and then
88:47 - we can work on that and
88:50 - also maybe work on twitch yeah
88:54 - yeah so we can work on twitch and
88:57 - upgrade the stream and the
88:59 - authentication yeah
89:02 - so okay bro sounds good let's actually
89:05 - work on it and then
89:06 - yeah i'm getting pretty excited to talk
89:09 - with david and amanus too
89:11 - on the ad side yeah that would be sick
89:15 - so fishing outside yeah yeah so we can
89:17 - actually spend
89:18 - certain days uh even going on ads or
89:22 - giving them some strategy with it but
89:24 - i'm really excited about that
89:26 - yeah that would be awesome all right
89:29 - things are
89:29 - crazy yeah these are being this exciting
89:32 - stuff coming your way guys
89:33 - yeah it's i'm i'm excited all right guys
89:36 - hopefully you guys enjoyed this stream
89:39 - where we're
89:40 - learning react native together with you

oh what is up guys how's it going this is kazzy here from cleverprogrammer.com today i am here with your boy papa react how's it going guys welcome back to day three of react native build so this is gonna be fun and we're going to be building on top of what we've already done so exciting stuff and we've got a new computer running so everything should be silky smooth right quasi that's right so this is going to be amazing because we have an imac pro and it's brand new so we're going to be installing all of the things with you today whether it's expo or node whatever we need to make this thing work we're going to be kind of installing that with you so that way you can actually keep up with us exactly and we're working on react native today as well and we're going to continue building our react native application the income tracker that we were actually building a few days ago exactly so really fun stuff we're going to be touching on things like expo uh today the main feature is going to be around react navigation so react native navigation so how you can navigate between stacks is something i did a long time ago but i don't remember how to do it so it's going to be fun going ahead and learning that together again um building that with kazi um so yeah in fact uh also welcome guys uh mohammed humza says i love these build videos but i think reactive typescript will also be good 100 we can go ahead and we will be covering typescript at some point as well yeah um yeah everything guys we'll pretty much eventually get around to everything beautiful all right with that said let's jump right into it so in order to run this app sonny on this computer um i believe that we're gonna need to install the expo cli is that right that's right so expo cli is gonna allow us to run so if you guys don't know what expo is um it's basically i mean what's the best way of explaining expo it's like a way to run the react native app yeah it just makes it easier to run the react react native apps instead of needing so many different things like um even xcode honestly i don't think you need xcode right to make this work i don't think so i don't think so in fact we can we'll check it now and also massive uh super chat from gabriel graves good to see you dude oh she said thank you for the donation dude gabriel gabe uh gabriel graves always coming in making our day dude thank you so much for that ten dollar donation let's go thank you dude amazing where am i extremely great content appreciate that dude ah beautiful here are my air horns when i need them boom holy [ __ ] that blew up my ears actually a little bit especially with these headphones they actually blows the arrow ouch that hurt all right cool so dope let's get into it so now i also need npm yes so we're gonna have to install node all right cool get npm oh is that how you do it i usually do it with just uh go to node website download that little link there which one this one download node.js and npm right here yeah that's one from the node website once you install node it comes with npm i'm gonna go with the current one man i want the one the newest fanciest one this part can actually be great on how to install node js on your computer so maybe if somebody wants to clip it yeah you go ahead and like you can drop the time time stamps in the in the comments and i'll help everyone else that we can clip that from the you can actually message uh david or a monit if you want they can clip this moment okay all right cool so that is now installed beautiful let's see all right npm oh nice it looks like it found it let's do it awesome install expo it's working nice also guys you can notice that the command line right now looks kind of ugly right like it's got all this extra stuff going on uh we're gonna install a really handy tool called oh my zsh yes i love this tool it is the best i hate not having it when i get a new computer same every time i started a new job or something and they gave me a laptop i would always straight away oh my zsh and you literally just copy that command chuck it in the terminal and that's it it literally run and okay so this is saying uh rejected so because you're doing a global install aren't you so you might have to use sudo yeah there we go sudo and let's get this installed and while this is installing i'm going to open up another command line and hit this here so and we need the um xcode stuff so while that's doing that asm computing says what's up kazian saying new to the channel three days ago i know html css javascript php started getting to react three days ago and already know my way around thanks to you guys that's awesome dude that's great oh that's actually dope and i just realized i don't have my youtube open so i'm gonna actually go ahead and do just that oh the comments you mean yeah the youtube analytics or comments or any of that like i don't have it open nice bob builder says are you guys going to start building clones of react native soon yes in fact these series like the series of videos that we're dropping right now actually to show kind of warm you guys up to react native show you some of the features the fundamentals in react native like navigation how do you navigate through an app how it's very similar to react as in like how we're used to writing react and things like that um so we're gonna pretty much be doing that to introduce you and then we're gonna be doing some crazy big videos um so so get excited for that so if you guys love the clones let us know in the comments right now i can see uh even avail of availo so jeff says guys i think love you watch your clone videos it's helping me so much to understand and react concepts and all starting to make sense you're awesome i appreciate that dude so yeah i'm going to be dropping videos in react name also melbourne hey nice okay so now i got this thing working cool uh hopefully the xcode is installed what i was looking for no it's on no developers tools were found requesting install um what's going on can't stall because it's not currently available from the software update server interesting wait what did it say it said can't install even though i went installed it it said it gave me some weird error do we need csh we don't need it right like we just need to do it we don't need it right now it's just an additional thing all right i'm gonna just do npm start and i'm gonna get this app going bro okay so so it says opening dev tools in the browser okay nice and then let's open it guys you can scan the qr code that kazi's bringing up so expo another benefit of using it is it allows you to actually go ahead and share your running code so you guys can pull out your phone right now on android pull out a qr code read on iphone literally just point your camera at the screen and go ahead and do that i'm going to do that too and what we can do is everyone as we're coding can go ahead and demo the app on their phone which is pretty fun so it takes a little bit of time to download but once it's up and running you guys can actually see what we're coding on your own phone which is pretty cool yeah that always gets me super hyped up because i'm like hell yeah once i can see it on my phone it feels real to me exactly dude i'm just so hyped that like i jumped in the pool today dude i can't get over that i'm like [ __ ] killed it dude i'm gassed that's it soon you'll be jumping in it every day don't worry be good man freaking cannot find the variable you state a why are we using state um i fixed it i was using state a it was misspelled but i s but i fixed that misspelling i probably just didn't hit save reactive yeah what what is happening all right i'm gonna give you access to reading right and read and write what is why is hold on you state a is not defined um okay so that's actually some strange compiler stuff happening so i just probably didn't save it or something yeah i'm gonna i've stopped the package and then i'll run it again nice and then w to start it up in the browser opening the project the web browser and then you guys can see it starts building it in webpack and should be good oh nice nice nice nice nice nice okay localhost 1906. oh sick okay dude that's pretty sick then so you didn't actually install everything on xcode right to get that no you don't need xcode at all i think that's sick because xcode takes a year like ages to download yeah like i actually think yeah you just don't need it at all which makes it such a better experience in my opinion to use expo because like yeah xcode is just trash it takes so long yeah um go ahead and share your 19006 ball with me um okay cool okay yeah guys if you're enjoying the videos and you're enjoying this series of videos go ahead and smash the thumbs up button allow this video to get out to more people and it tells us that you guys want more stuff and we're going to be dropping a hell of a lot of stuff around this uh this topic and react native and all sorts of new new tricks and topics server side bringing in stuff to enjoy what's up doing like next js type of stuff would be cool too at some point yeah yeah yeah next year dude i actually want to get into that quite a lot as well so um that would be sick yeah i did it once at tesco i was working with xjs and uh it's kind of a mind mind match to get around it yeah but very powerful like really really bad and it's super demand like if you can have nextgs on your on your portfolio as well if you react the tv and all that stuff then you're pretty jacked as a developer so right now all right i'm gonna try to get the app again so i'm gonna scan i just scanned it you guys can scan it too if you want while i hover over it and it's building it on my phone right now okay cool and what does it take to run an ios simulator again um i think i mean we couldn't run it successfully right for some reason oh okay so ios isn't gonna work because that's gonna need xcode okay that's fine let's forget about that then and let's just keep on building on top of this yeah but i mean we can get it running on the phone and that should be good so now we've got okay so it's got massive console log and then we've got okay check the render method of app okay so app 149.9 we have nice that worked okay so i added these two and it actually made a point awesome 9 000 plus 200 gives you 9 200 and that point is um ten thousand six hundred odd to see why is that one yeah wait why is it hard to see should be pretty easy to see is it on ecam it's kind of it's not as clear youtube is crystal um it's a bit difficult to see if you want me to keep it on ecam or do you want me to oh no that's good i've got now i've got a bigger screen so i can see it on youtube as well got it okay nice um share your 19 or where you're seeing that share that part okay share server there we go okay so pamela pamela says guys do you think that i can work fulltime remote as a front end from romania how much can i make as a junior 100 firstly yes you can work fulltime remote regardless of where you're from um we have tons of students in the course who are doing that right now um and how much can i make as a junior that's really dependent on how much work you're willing to put in um you can make money as a freelancer as a teacher and land a job so you can make a hell of a lot of money as a junior developer it just depends on the amount of work that you're putting in um to sell yourself and make yourself valuable as a developer okay um dope dude should we jump in yeah let's do it so uh i've got the app problem running now as well awesome okay hey okay so now guys today we're going to be pretty much adding on react navigation so you know inside of an app how you've got like the different screens that you can kind of click through and things like that um we're going to show you how to implement that now a very popular one that i've used in the past is called react uh native navigation so react native navigation so cause you're gonna go ahead and google it yeah um and we're gonna pretty much be building this from fresh so this is not prepared it's fresh um me and kazi don't haven't done this before i haven't done this in a very long time so it's very fresh as well so we're going to run into bugs you guys are going to see how we overcome them and hopefully it'll bring you guys some value in doing that um yeah so react native navigation and what just happened why did my chrome just crash makes no sense all right so um i'm here the pretty link you see the one which underneath it yeah so not the github one yeah that one this one react navigation.org yep and then we've got so let's go ahead and click on uh redox and then let's just kind of follow the implementation and we'll get this thing built up so the first thing we're going to do is install react navigation native and we're going to this is for building navigations i imagine yeah so navigate so in react in typical react we use react router so that's what we're so familiar with everyone who's done the clones will know what react router is in in a native app obviously you don't just have pages you have actual sort of navigation you can actually tap through so imagine instagram when you're using instagram things like um you actually go into a separate screen right and then you can kind of click back and swipe back into that screen yeah um so we call that uh app navigation so in this case it's react navigation harsh says i made 1100 project by just learning from your react js tutorial you made my career hey that's amazing that's awesome i love hearing success stories guys keep sharing them by the way if you have any more success stories or if you've made any income or anything from these videos um it's actually quite a common thing that we're we're quite familiar with now so let's still okay so that's import that's done right yeah okay nice so the next one installing dependencies into an expo okay so i think we actually needed that one um um really all right yeah so copy that second line expo install um it's good it's cool we just we just keep keep the files when we want but paste it yeah so copy that one and paste that one so you see the second one it says expo install uhhuh i just did it nice and then you can now continue uh to hello react navigation to start writing some code so go ahead and click on that little pub link okay so the way it works in react native is you have something called a stack navigator from what i remember as well so basically stacks are like imagine you push things onto the stack and then when you swipe back so imagine like when you swipe back on an app it pops from the stack and then when you like click onto a new page it pushes onto a stack so imagine like an array or like a list you're basically just pushing screens onto this stack and then that way it can come on let's let's visualize it so i can follow with you so okay so tell me what to draw so imagine like an array okay so i got an array yes yes like any kind of list right so imagine like the instagram home page so let's imagine we're on the instagram homepage let's just have that as an entry inside this array okay so so i'll just um all right got it so this is just a home so this would be the home right now imagine on instagram you know you have the the dms right you have the instagram dms yeah um the messages get sent right now imagine we tap the dms and then we pretty much go ahead and we push the dms page onto the stack okay i see right and now what this allows us to do is now on our app we're going to see the dms page which means that we get to we're on a dm's page yeah um but then imagine so on on apps you have that natural swipe back so you typically would go from the left side and swipe back right yes when you swipe back it'll take you to it'll take you from dms to home yeah because basically what you're going to do is you're going to pop from the stack which means pop the existing screen and you go back to the home screen got it right stack okay and then in this way imagine you're in your home dms and then you tap into a dm so like a message you see how it kind of stacks up right like it stacks up and then it basically you can pop every time you kind of swipe back it pops pops pops until you get back to where you want to go yeah now this is very similar to how react uh ru does it so when we built clones in the past you're pretty much just like redirecting then when you click the back button it goes back a page but now it's the native version so it's like stacks are used instead to sort of mimic that behavior right okay got it that's cool that's really cool okay yeah what kind of shot bloody i'm shocked i remember that because i haven't done this in a while um so what we're going to do is we're going to create a stack navigator all right and hopefully it's going to work first time and the stack navigator it says is a function that returns an object containing two properties screen and navigator both of them are react components for use for configuring a navigator so let's just go ahead and we'll cut this up we'll just play around with it and see cool so let's look at app.js so right now we have the entire app rendering in app.js right so it's going to be a bit difficult to actually go ahead and change any of this so what we could do is refactor this firstly into so this entire page is like a is a page inside of our app so what we're going to do is maybe make this the home page we'll make this we'll call this the home page right yeah so what we'll do is we're going to create a new component hold on let me yeah i'm following you cool yeah let's go ahead and create a new file called homepage.js and it's going to be capital h so homepage.js um go ahead and add a new file called homepage.json do you want me to do it yeah so that way they can see it so homepage.js nice and then we're going to use our neat little rfce trick to go ahead and get it there we go i'm going to change this to an arrow function so it's consistent but basically what we're going to do here is this is not going to be oh yeah oops yep this is now going to be the page that we want to render so what we're going to do is we're actually going to refactor all the code and what i mean by effect is that we're just moving it from app.js to this component okay and hopefully everything shouldn't break and it should be nice and work the way we want it to so what i'm going to do in a very nasty way is i'm going to basically go ahead and go inside of app.js so you need to follow me on on the code i think kazi all right here we go so i'm going to go ahead and just pretty much grab everything inside of app.js right now and i'm going to pretty much paste it inside page and we're going to fix any bugs that come up so i had an issue there and i had yeah yeah i believe nope let me go ahead and do that again that's bad bad copy so we want to go from the top of the file so const app and i'm going to go all the way down to the um the there we go so i'm going to get that and i'm basically going to go ahead and replace this there we go so now i have everything copied from the app.js into this one i'm going to even copy the styles and i'm going to pop that on top because it's a bit easier to actually read when we pop it on top and then i'm going to go back to our code and just literally grab all the same imports and paste them in here so we have everything pretty much that we have inside of app now inside of this new homepage.js okay yeah um so what we're going to do now is we're going to basically go ahead and clean this up so i'm going to go and actually remove all this code so it's just going to be const app and then all of the return we're going to have the safe area view but i'm going to remove the styles i'm just going to have it very very clean so i'm actually going to go ahead and remove all of these imports and remove the user effect and stuff like that and then here i'm going to say render the home page like that oops self closing so this should if we didn't break anything it should work so we have the same app yeah it's literally the same app now it's just rendering from so it's a safe area view is not defined okay so i need to uh just import it from react native so i'm gonna do that but i'm gonna get rid of all these extra ones that we don't need there we go save up and home page is not defined oh yep of course we need to import our homepage so we say import home page from home page like so oops my bad that was me no problem and then that should work now nice okay beautiful hey look at that yeah so this is typically how you want your act structured right so you wanted to have like a page and then you have the at the app now it looks really clean to read the code yeah it's clean right because now it's like inside of a safe area view we've pretty much just got the homepage which is dope like it's very clean that also means inside of homepage.js we don't actually need another safe area view so i think it's stopped following me some weird reason really okay there we go now i'm following you again so so here we have a safer review and then it's kind of nested it within another safe area of you here so this one now we can just change to a actual just a view um because we don't actually need the the two safe arrow views nested because this one is already wrapping the component inside of a sleeper review um not sure the danger of double wrapping it but we just don't we don't want to do that okay so that's pretty cool so we have that now so now it will make it easier to actually go ahead and implement implement react navigation you always want to make it your knife easier clean up the code and you see once you like it may have seemed like a big task but you see we just did it in less than five minutes yeah so now let's go back to the react navigation docs and kazi can you see how this is very similar to what we do with react rua so we get it to this clean stance and then we start to implement the sort of navigation part yes yeah so it's very very similar to like how we do it there and now in their example they've got the separate components they've got function home screen which is essentially what we just did yeah we built our home page yeah and now what we're going to do is we're going to grab the stack so we're going to say constant equals create stack navigator so i'm basically going to go ahead and pop that in actually i'm going to pop in on top here yeah and the stack navigator we need to import i'm going to import two things from that file you can see and that is the navigation container and create stack contain navigator and then we're going to surround our app inside so i'm actually just going to copy this block you know so i'm going to copy this block stack navigator i'm just going to nest it correctly and then the home page i'm going to cut our existing homepage so i'm going to comment this out for a second and then when it says name okay you're going to it allows you to give it a prop component yes and you just feed it the home page and then it knows what to do with it exactly that got it yeah dope see what we did there and you know you don't need the safe view right or do you need it because i assume that this should know how to make things safe no so it doesn't actually know how to make things safe but you're this brought up a good point so we actually previously before we don't want the safer review to be encapsulating the entire app we wanted to encapsulate the component itself um also td tdain blank this is live so yeah everything's live right now um so we're going to go ahead and change the we're going to add the safe area view back to the home page and remove it from here because it shouldn't be here it should actually be at the lower level so i'm going to go back to this preview this the view that we were i don't know why it keeps unfollowing me um go ahead and yeah so now let's go ahead and add the save review back here so save for a review and we can reimport save for review there we go and save it then then you're right we don't need it here so we can get rid of it like that oh you just added it to home page yeah added it to the home because you actually don't want it to be um because some imagine like you have a and the top and that header right the header in some apps actually goes into that safe area and you purposely want it to sometimes because it gives you like a full screen experience yeah yeah so it's in some situations you actually don't want the safe area view because you want it to kind of like be this seamless full screen experience got it yeah so that's cool now let's actually see if we broke anything so it says cannot resolve react navigation stack um so we actually need to uh and we need to install that it looks like oh yeah so installing the stack navigator library we didn't do that so we need to do if you scroll up on the docks it says npm install react navigate yet we need to just pop that into terminal shashank said he says how to learn if i don't even know the basics um so i would recommend literally there's so much free content out there to learn html css javascript you can pretty much go ahead and watch that stuff and then follow with the lives we offer a course called profit with javascript um and that you can pretty much you don't have to have any experience you can pretty much go ahead and join that that's literally cleverprogrammer.com pwj if you're interested um and yeah like and then pretty much you can go ahead and just jump in and you don't need any experience to go ahead and to learn that and you can pretty much go ahead and get running to the point that we're at right now yep so this is the course you can go check it out here's the link and it should also be in the description below and feel free to check it out yeah go ahead and check that out dope all right so we got this going and it should be installed so let's dude it works nice wait what happened it did have a little bit oh [ __ ] i see the home screen at the top that's cool man that's that's super cool damn okay dope that would be excited holy [ __ ] all right now let's um let's figure out how to do our first kind of stack stacked item so we can see now we're on the home screen i think it would look different on the app as well i think it would be in the middle so it would be like native looking i'm trying to build it on my phone but for whatever reason i just cannot get my phone to compile it properly maybe turn it off tunnel mode do it local and it'll be faster for you and then just share your phone on the screen that might be the easiest way i think so not land local yeah do uh do local oh maybe lan because your phone's connected to your wifi otherwise you i think you have to be plugged in i'm not sure all right all right yeah try that all right i'm gonna try lan usually on lan and local it freaking poops out it's giving me nothing it's just like empty blank screen i'll try again yeah boom empty black screen cool let's go tunnel cena sure says you guys should teach us how to market our services to land clients we actually do all of that in pwj we show you how to go ahead and make an income with skills you know when you learn um a lot of courses out there boot camps and stuff they'll teach you how to code but they don't tell you how to market yourself and actually show your value to everyone out there we pride ourselves around that approach as opposed to just being a developer because that's really where you make money so um we actually cover that in the course also we actually run tons of trainings and stuff like that which uh you can feel free to check out there's a bunch of if you go ahead and look at some of the old youtube videos there's a bunch of trainings that we run uh feel free to go ahead and dive out yeah check out all those trainings and we just put together a website called reactbrothers.com so yeah you can actually go there and uh check out what's going on too exactly and uh we put we'll we'll start putting together our like top tutorials on there so yeah you can feel free to check it out and we'll put all our like big react js builds all in one place exactly literally endless value for you guys yeah value every day yeah so we're right now what we're doing is we're going to do a few streams where we're also learning with you like react native and then we're going to do a stream where we're just like building a project and then going all out on it and i think by this week we'll crack the code for sure on twitch and uh we'll be streaming on twitch as well and the streaming experience is going to get a lot a lot better yeah we've got upgrades because like what i'm excited about sunny is i want to put it in 60 frame rates per second so then it has that like silky buttery feel to it but are you smooth exactly yeah oh yeah dude are you getting are you stocking up on toilet paper oh yeah so guys it's locked down too in in uk so um surprisingly i went into my into my sort of like into the side room and we had like bundles of toilet rolls so i think my mom already did that holy [ __ ] everything pretty much yeah let's see lockdown lock down in us start nate let's see if there's another uh one coming soon um i don't see another lockdown coming soon but i feel like it's gonna it's gonna happen very very soon super annoying dude even the gym closes boris johnson imposes stay at home order as cases surge you know crazy man how how like what is happening with coronavirus right now like what's the growth rate as we speak because it's been a while whoa it like slowed down yeah it like peaked and then it came down and now it's kind of like on its second wave up it's like done with its launch yeah literally um okay let's do show all oh no no no it's not down bro look at that yeah across the u.s u.s is quite crazy dude like there is like if you check out uk uk has done pretty decent job of containing worldwide we're like spreading faster than ever how many people are there aren't we gonna run out of people soon to in fact how many people does it say in fact i can't read that 552 000 new cases a day bro holy [ __ ] like it was i remember when i used to track it i had this excel sheet and i would like manually log it and i started creating projections and it was at i think in march and i was like okay 2 200 4 000 new cases 6 000 new cases 13 000 new cases and now check it out bro 552 000 new cases it's insane man that's kind of nuts but deaths have seemed to be around the same yes it's strange right like uh and then but then there's only recorded deaths so that's another thing that's by coronavirus wow um all right i better get out of here because before i go down uh coronavirus rabbit hole by the way the stream is so clear on youtube right now is crystal like i'm just looking at you know it's nice guys go ahead and smash the thumbs up button because literally the stream right now looks so good on youtube i'm just checking out does it look better than normal yeah i mean like it's the clearest i've ever seen it like definitely yeah and that has to do with this beast beastly imac pro let's check out the specs and see what's happening um physical memory is gigs 37. yeah i stop menu too is that an app uh it's like a yeah it's like a one the one one of those apps that live in the top of the sort of you know the helper thing i don't think it's i think you have to download it off the website oh no it might be here it might be i start typing i start yeah i start menu this is the one dude i don't know man it looks like garbage what are you doing with this it's like it's like this one it's the best uh sort of app to tell you about yours wait is it this one no it's not this one this one looks better this one does not look best [ __ ] 3.7 i don't know i don't think i got it from app store but it's so handy because the only app that like actually shows me what's going on in a glance ah i see so i can see my gpu i can see my my even my hard drives uh my upload download speeds i can see everything in one go oh [ __ ] all right i'm gonna just uh buy this and then uh right now oh you're using that one yeah uh you know what i i don't need this right now i don't need to make an impulse buy because of you um i just need to check stop going the thumbs up we're going crazy really guys go ahead did does anyone use istat mini 2 by the way in the comments because it is dope man oh people are like definitely clearer oh interesting solo says bye bye video monetization yeah seriously i talked about chronovirus for so long this video is gonna vanish oh yeah [ __ ] um actually yeah i think it's because of this wait till i put up um obs and then i'll max it out on bitrate and [ __ ] like it's gonna be dialed in dude it's gonna look so good yeah i mean dude that right now is i can't believe how clear it is right now like yeah i could see everything it wasn't an internet problem it was literally a processing problem because yeah processing even i upgraded my mac um then my streams got better when i do solo streams so this i mean imac pro is going to be super like able to do everything how much memory do people have on their computers like people don't have 128 gig right or or ram yeah ram no no no all right yeah definitely no i forgot how much is a normal ram i lost since uh my macbook has 32 gigs okay cool cool yeah like look it says 37 are used so that's why my other computer would be just dead right now yeah exactly so uh it's it is easily worth the investment yeah people are like yo this is awesome yeah like look at how fast this is bro oh [Laughter] all right cool so we're talking about stacks stacks so now we want to go ahead and add a second stack so we've got the home screen which is looking good we have this stack dot screen um over here yeah so we want to go ahead and actually create a second stack and then let's go ahead and call this one um let's just call this like details for now right so it's just like a we're going to call it a details page or i mean what's a nice second screen let's just call it messages or something yeah yeah [ __ ] details details and then this let's go ahead and create a new file called uh messages.js which is just going to be a message screen uhhuh okay so i'll do that hold on let me actually uh pop in something real quick on my uh preferences let's go uh display i just want to drop a little under scan because wait is that happening under scan oh yeah why can't i throw a um oh no i can throw under the skin all right just want to do that just because things weren't like full on the screen really yeah now it should be even more crisp for people watching oh damn yeah oh bloody oh you guys like that is crystal for you guys yeah i just needed to throw a little uh a little under scan you know i'm not even going to pretend i have no idea what underscore me yeah when you have a tv so i'm on a giant tv right now a problem that happens is like you see all this space here oh yeah it's like above the screen so i don't even have access to it it doesn't even fit into the screen oh really yeah so i have to throw under scan to like make the screen shrink in size usually i just do aspect ratio on the tv remote to that 16x9 damn sonny back to react holy [ __ ] all right second stack is let's go ahead and create messages.js and this is going to be like a messages screen right so why don't we create a admin dashboard where we can see everybody's income that has logged it okay we could do that so should we do um so this is the home page so what would this what would a second page be let's go ahead and create like i said oh we could do like i mean a lot page um a login page yeah the login page is good yeah let's do login page because we're eventually going to have a some kind of room for that so login page.js here so and then for the name of the page we're going to call it login and for the component we're going to go ahead and say so login page we're now in login page we're gonna do a nice little rfce trick and this is the beautiful thing it's literally the same as what we've done before guys it's the same reactor we all know and love and you can just do that and it's not a div so remember oh damn actually oh yeah we actually changed that so it's not a div it's uh so rather than rfce we're gonna do our rn yeah what is it rnfc rnfe yeah react native functional something export yeah so and then we're here we're going to say i am the login page right yeah and then sunny i'll be right back okay okay so we're gonna do that and then here we need to just go ahead and say login page and we need to do an import so i'm gonna go ahead and say import and a little trick for you guys if you go ahead and highlight what you want to go ahead and sort of like select on the screen but you do command d you see i've got double cursors now which is dope so now i can actually go ahead and do login page which is pretty sick and it helps you you get very quick at doing that um and and it really does i use that all the time so if you guys didn't know that and you actually found that useful smash the thumbs up button because that's always gonna help you guys out uh ammar rozak says login firebase oh yeah we're going to be doing that um there's actually a really cool library uh i think it's called react native firebase so react native firebase you guys can't see this right now because it's on a different screen but yeah reacting to firebase.io and basically what they did is they went ahead and done all the hard work to go ahead and handle the sort of like using react native and firebase together so so we've got firestore cloud functions cloud messaging guys if you thought firestore was a firebase was jacked for for web apps wait until you see for uh react native apps you can do so much stuff it's crazy and guys if you want to see machine learning that's going to be cool because machine learning so you can use things like i'm going to go ahead and i'm just listing out what i'm i can see on my screen so it's ml kit vision so you can use text recognition landmark recognition barcode scaling scanning image labeling and face detection all of the uh yeah so all of that stuff you can do remote config performance monitoring natural language processing which is bloody sick so um cena sure i said sunny don't you think firebase is a bit slow what how firebase is so fast dude like um i don't know if it's if it's i can't see the thumbnail but yeah firebase is insane honestly firebase is like a it's it's insanely fast uh in terms of the server availability and stuff like that firebase is on fire guys so no i think it is extremely performant um and chances are they do a lot better than we would do it uh if we were manually doing it so firebase is extremely powerful guys um bob builder says bro you guys should do something in machine learning that would be so sick 100 aaron actually did drop something i did a video with aaron even before so if you're interested in some machine learning videos we've dropped someone before on clever programmer but it'll be pretty cool to go ahead and actually have um react native with machine learning i think that would be sick so if you guys want to see that smash thumbs up and we can get that moving uh james gail says more shortcuts please i will show you some shortcuts in a sec uh seen the sugar i say up and every request takes like two seconds most likely either a your network connection or b the way you're sending your requests is nonperformance so you need to look into it could be either those things but trust me it is lightning fast kkpk says what's better for making a website react or django my opinion react uh this is why is the number one most wanted language right now um according to stack overflow survey and for good reason uh okay so bubbles i've been seeing stuff in the internet saying firebase sucks like querying stuff do you think that's true remember guys there's this okay you can either get sucked into the world of opinionated sort of like what is better this sucks that framework sucks or you can just suck it up look at the facts and the fact is it's the number one most wanted language and just become so damn amazing with it right so that's what i would say focus on that because most people i see is like yeah you know like it's not performing and stuff guys like stop wasting time it's an excuse by doing that you're literally giving yourself an excuse to not progress so make sure you just just forget all that stuff just start coding and trust me you can make a ton of money off of this stuff so i would say go ahead and do that so uh we've got seahan says tell me what the dismantler is using randy of web apps instead of react.js um disadvantages deployments are slower you're going to have to approve your app to deploy on the app store that's going to take time whereas react you can just do a quick deployment um but you get all the native features so it depends if you want to put in the work to build a renegade app you actually can have a lot more power including notifications so that's a big one um yeah arabroski dope so what are we doing right now react native firebase stuff so um dude i think as well it would be a killer video to do machine learning and react native oh yeah i would want to do machine learning and react but we could do it with react native too yeah because uh firebase have a ton of really powerful libraries with react native um so so that would be yeah for machine learning sorry yeah i think like tensorflow or something along those lines would be sick i always wanted to uh also do chess with react make a chess game oh [ __ ] i'll be sick yeah all right bro so um what's going on here so like we we're trying to add the next page which is going to be login page right yes so look it's showing up at the top in the navigation yeah so we have to set all that up so right now we actually have um okay so right now this is just setting things up so one thing we can also do while we're here at this point is we can say we can actually pass an additional prop so for the login page if we wanted the title of the login page not to be login page or anything like that but we can go ahead and pass in an options and then what we do is that takes an object and that object takes a title and inside that title you can go ahead and say login or you can say login screen i mean nobody sees login screen you can just say sign in or sign up sign in or sign up let's do that sign in or sign up right uh something like that just to make it very clear that that's actually we're going to see so we've set up the screens right now okay we've got these routes we've got the home screen the title screen and things like that the initial route you can actually go ahead and pass in so right now it's just by default grabbing the first one but you can actually go ahead and add this in so it says initial route name home if you wanted the initial route name on login we should let's try that actually let's save it and let's see if it uh takes us to the whoa there we go nice yeah so you can see we have rooting we have some kind of rooting in the app you know yep um and then what we're going to do is we're going to change up back to home but now we're ready to go to the next step which is um so usually i contact us and use a render callback um okay so now we're going to do is go to the next step so if you go to um back to the docs and go to uh where if you scroll down it'll say what's next and uh they should have a next section button so what's next moving between screens there we go yeah all right so yeah so you can see that that's typically how we do it on a react app so it's no no no sorry that's not a reactive that's a typical web app no a typical web page right so no react app we use link in um but in the normal web page we have it says on pratt on press so navigating to a new screen would look like on press navigation.navigate um login page yeah so the key here is actually that navigation.navigate yep right that button is just medium you can and at any point in your code you can call that navigate uh sort of piece of code yeah but here we'll do the same exam we'll have a button which says like go to login or whatever like that so on our home page let's go down to the the sort of let's add a where we have let's build a react native app let's actually have a button so i'm going to go ahead and add a button and remember their buttons are actually weird they're self closing and then they have a title prop yeah so let's just say go to let's just say login a button called login and then we'll have an on press and the on press would go ahead and it's an arrow function so it's going to be like an inline code or you can actually call a separate function so it's typically how we know and do it and react we're going to say navigation dot navigate and then this would typically be the name so if you remember we set the name of this one as home and the name of this one is login so that's what we're going to navigate to so in this case we're going to navigate to login where'd you get the preload manager from what is this oh no that's that's that was wrong that that just autofilled it should be navigation like what did i miss that should be navigation yeah and then what we need to do is actually import um okay so this is another clever thing um so it actually gets passed down as a prop so uh if we go ahead and i remember this now so if we go back to the top of home page so remember guys this is where the props come in right in react apps you have a component and it can accept some props now whenever you've got a stack inside of this sort of a chart which is a child of this navigator inside of this navigate container all of these chart components actually get a prop and that prop if we destructure it it's going to have whatever props you pass in normally as well as something called navigation okay and this is basically like a navigation handler that comes down so this is how we can go ahead and do navigations.navigate login so at this point we should um see let's go ahead and see inside of our app right now i'm seeing a login button if i click it oh dope dude oh [ __ ] okay go to um i see it login and boom oh [ __ ] that's clean nice that's slick that is even see by default it's putting it on the stack and then we can pop pretty much um damn that's pretty sick yeah they made it they made it a lot neater than it used to be um okay i did i'm loving coding and react native now because uh back in the day used to be a pain to do that really yeah it wasn't as clean uh before and now like everyone that comes to it's like oh this is super clean it's like you guys are getting the nice end of this which is cool yeah so navigate okay so navigate to a root multiple times let's go back to the docs and let's go ahead and check out okay so um so you can do a few things you can you can keep on you see there's navigation.push if we go down um there's this so you so basically navigate is the best one because navigate is very it's very clever if you try and navigate to the same screen twice it's not going to like stack up the same screen twice it will just stack it at once but if you go ahead and push twice it will push twice if you see that gif yeah it says and you see you can keep stacking the same page and in some situations you may need that so it's just worth knowing that you can do that um got it okay that's cool and then we've got the um so if we scroll down there's actually a you can actually have a button which navigates back so you can so by default yes it added it to the header but some apps you might notice that they don't use the default native stuff right they don't always cool that they do it for you that's kind of nice yeah so they do it for you but if you wanted it like programmatically as part of your component um so let's actually try this out let's go ahead and into our code let's go to the login page and let's add a button here with a title which says go to home page oh no just to say go back right go back and then here we'll say on press is going to be an arrow function which is going to do and remember we need to get our props when we destructure him we say get the navigation and then here we say navigation dot go back like that and that should what where is this coming from oh we're giving it to it on the app.js yeah so remember because it's a child of these two things it's like a these are basically like called higher order components so they basically inject a prop into its children which is navigation oh okay yes the way to think of it is just because they're like children of these so navigation container and this stacked navigator and because they're inside of it they by default are going to get that prop so but just think of it that way so they just they get that prop navigation right got it so we can so we can actually use that like that and now if we go to our uh our app we should see in the login page um we actually need to save app.js and log in login page it's not i think you have to save it yeah and even without.js all right i saved all of them that's bad now we should be able to see oh okay buttons not buttons not um defined so we need to define button and then save loginpage.js okay and then we refresh and now log in go back hey so now not only have we got in the header we've also got it as a programmatic file now come for me nothing is changing uh click login there we go huh you see it's got it go go back i see yeah nice right so now we can do it programmatically and we know that it also adds to the header by default so that's that header that gets attached right so now that header you can customize it you can make it look however you want you can even customize the icons that appear yeah also remember on the login screen it says sign in or sign up right so remember we actually added that as a prop here which was options so if you go to login screen so if you click on the login button you see at the top it says sign in or sign up yep and that's because we passed in this title prop got it yeah um so that's like you see like there's just different use cases of props but if in reality when you i know it's like it can be confusing because it's like it's just something new but in reality it's actually pretty pretty clean um in order to customize tiles and things like that once you set up your routes everything is pretty clean and you can imagine now you just code with react pretty much and you have rooting inside of your app yeah and by default this is going to support on android so android phones have a button which is always designated to go back right they have that kind of you know backwards carrier um that's going to do the pop functionality for them and on ios the swipe back is going to do that for you got it yeah so that's pretty cool so we have go back um okay so that's pretty much oh yeah i also know nas wants to learn um react native too actually oh really yeah he really wants to yeah so it will be ill it's something cool for you guys to attack too in some calls yeah yeah we should definitely do that i think even in the coaching calls it will be really cool to start attacking uh react native as well yeah um because it would be like a a circular thing would learn more in the cause it would come back on youtube we can do crazy builds um that'll be fun okay so next section is passing parameters to roots um okay so passing parameters to roots um i mean at this point we could actually implement a a bit of a flow to our app yeah we could actually have a login functionality at this point okay cool just trying to think we want to tackle i think we said something along the lines of last time like we wanted to tackle authentication today yeah so we could tackle authentication today okay so we've got the login page um so in that case what we can do is um go to react nate type in on google react native firebase yeah so this this uh uh sort of like library is actually a crazy library like i'm not sure who's built this like or like it's like a big team but they basically like adapted everything that firebase gives for react native and you can pretty much go ahead and use everything that react firebase offer but they have everything set up but you can see there's like a bunch of things that you can do and signing out and stuff like that now the reason is is that you might be wondering can't we just use the typical react way that we do it before but make sure you use that one the reason being is because they have very clever ways of listening to the login state which is different in an app you don't want it to kind of be glitchy and kind of like log in and then kind of every time you go on the app it kind of logs in and passes you over you want it to like cache the login and do things like that so um let's go ahead and install this into our project so if you go to the top installation um so installation i installed this um react native firebase app oh you did that yeah although okay so um react native firebase app okay cool and then what we need to do as well is if you're developing your app using ios run this command so we need to actually go ahead and and i mean we're not going to do that right now because we haven't got xcode installed but you would have to do cd ios because if you notice inside of um inside of a react native app you actually have a hidden folder called ios and then you you have to do this thing called pod install but we're not going to do that right now later um but what we're going to do now is it says listening to authentication state so remember on on the react clones where does it say that um so you have why does your one look different so your installation go down um oh sorry you're looking at a different you need to go to go up to the top sorry click on the little uh pull out uh burger menu uhhuh and then click on authentication usage oh but you know we should maybe actually get you getting started first yeah because we actually need to install the the course things um so yeah go back to what you where you're at sorry that's that's good idea um so yeah so you see there is a setup involved for android and there's a setup involved for um ios as well there's two separate things that we're going to have to do for those projects um configure file and you see you have to kind of run through these to set everything up it is a little bit kind of clunky but i would say maybe what we could do in this case is let me just check if we can maybe do it for because the the process for that won't be good to do now because of the xcode issue so let me just check on the authentication side i tell you what we could do kazi why don't we show them sort of a a coded example of a login that pushes them to so once you log in with the correct sort of you know hardcoded sure thing yeah yeah we could try that oh sugar show emily's in the chat oh [ __ ] hi baby let's go no oh she's at the boxing gym that's sick make sure you they get their recording really well what the [ __ ] we just got a 50 pound donation 50 euros yeah let's go by pika crazy go ahead and pull that on the screen yeah there we go and wow that thank you for all your work guys i added netflix whatsapp and amazon clone to my portfolio it helped me a lot to obtain a 40k euros a year long time contract as a full stack junior developer this is part of my first monthly pay thank you very much that's amazing that is insane well done that's awesome man oh [ __ ] that's awesome congratulations pika that is amazing wow thank you for the donation appreciate it yeah that's interesting hell yeah bro keep up that music that's insane i love seeing that dude like uh and 40 000 euros a year is actually not bad at all for a junior developer that's a really good salary to be honest as a junior so that's what it really is that's crazy um i was thinking yeah so maybe let's do it as we just have an input yeah we have it and then we have two inputs and then if they put the correct username and password so a very simple nonlayered authentication and then what we can do is we'll run through a full setup of of this once we have everything set up um no so we don't run into it right so at this point let's go ahead and on the login page just let's have the input fields that we're going to need um so right now we had i'm just looking at the input fields that we did previously so input okay so text input is what we were looking for so what we're gonna do is on login page we're gonna have two text inputs we're gonna have text input text input and i don't want this right here so i'm going to go ahead and get rid of these in a sec so this is going to bug out if we save it so we're going to have a placeholder for this one the styles we don't have at this point um i'm gonna pull this forward right so we're gonna have text input the first one is gonna be the username right so it's gonna say enter a username or we'll just say enter your username and then here we'll say enter your password right and then i think they should have a simple form right now right what was that you're just making a simple form right now yeah simple form that's all we're doing right now so um we can go ahead and say for the stars we'll leave that for now and we're going to add two pieces of state so we're going to use the use state hook so we're going to say use state and then we're going to say const username oh god i hate windows our username and it's always like the most random thing that i could like ever come up with exactly like dude oh man you stay and then we'll say blank right and i'm going to copy this paste it go ahead and say password set password and then for here we're going to say the value of the first one is going to be the username and then when they change it it's going to get the text and it's going to set the username to the text and yeah dope dude do the same thing for that that's awesome that's what you call pair programming guys oh that's sick and now for the styles we're gonna actually go ahead and i'm gonna go ahead and create a style sheet at the top and for the input fields we don't have title text but for the input fields i'll keep it very simple and we'll go ahead and uncomment these out and we should at that point have what we need to get up and running so let me go ahead oh man my spacing's all messed up okay so boom boom boom there we go so save now it says style sheet dot create so we need a bunch of things from react native repetitive so let's go ahead and get the style sheet so i'm going to go here and say style sheet import we also need the text input that's going to bug out and then we if we go to login page it's there's another problem where we don't have the text input so i just imported that text input um we should have it now so it should be working though text we have login okay awesome so the border color is red right now which is a bit extreme let's just have standard black orders oops black and then save um yeah there you go and now it should be on that page to log in there we go so enter your username into your password um so the password right now isn't the correct type right so you see if we go to login and we start typing in the password field so click on login login yep so you'll notice when you start typing in password it doesn't hide the characters um so let's go ahead and check how we do that so type text input password type react native let's check how we do that so here we actually just need to change we need to make it secure text entry so we need to do uh it's actually weirdly enough like this yeah it'll be an actual thing like that secure text entry and i should there we go go ahead there we go that works hey nice so now instead of this button doing just a simple go back let's create a function called const login right this is going to be a basic arrow function and here on press we're just going to do a login right i'm going to say login now when we hit the login button we just want to basically go ahead and say if the username this is a very simple dummy example okay if the username is kazi and the password hell yeah and the password is say one two three four one two three four let's do admin one two three four admin no no no no no just admin that's gonna be too hard to remember it's just admin yeah yeah just admin bro that's my shoes here so if if the username is causing the password admin then what we're gonna do is we're just gonna allow them to navigate to the home screen so firstly to make our app super secure we're gonna go ahead and change the initial route to the login okay so the initial route is a login so you should end up there first and then the only way to get to the home page is if you log in so here we're going to say navigation navigation dot navigate to home if you have the correct username and password okay so and then rather than saying go back it should say login so now you can see a typical sort like kind of example uh flow for an app so we should be able to go ahead and see um if we go ahead and use like let's go ahead and say it what do oh snap that's awesome right what's that what is it is it because i put in the wrong password on purpose oh it did nice nice it worked hey there we go all right and you can see like and obviously there's things to consider like at that point you wouldn't want them to be able to go back you would we would have different sort of handling mechanisms for that but the main thing is that by using that authentication library what we would do is we'll combine this with something like the redux um sort of state management library that we talked about in previous builds we would have that working in in sort of partnership with that react native firebase library and then we would basically check when the user is inside their app if they're logged in now if they're not logged in for any reason or if they're logging expired or something we can kick them back out to the login page yeah otherwise we just bring them to this home page right and you can see with that it's actually pretty simple like you can see now we have a fully functional sort of style app with login with sort of um obviously it was a dummy login the reason why we didn't do that is because of the um oh god you see the comments somebody said no holy [ __ ] adrian i live in bmw i hope you're okay bro that is kind of nuts what's going on there like who's shooting the cops are shooting or just random people are shooting that's crazy man because in the uk we just the gun laws are so strict we never really if you hear about a gun it's like oh my god that's crazy man so i don't know how you guys over in the states and stuff have it because it's pretty loose over there with gun laws right um yeah i guess i mean i'm i'm not too familiar with laws in general but yeah definitely not familiar with gun laws um well just hopefully you're safe adrian i mean i would say call the police but it looks like they're actually in a [ __ ] gun fight right now outside the house yeah dude um okay [Laughter] uh neo wt says hey i ended the airbnb clone and i can say i learned a lot from that stream i would like thank you for the effort and wish you good luck with your programs don't do thank you was fun yeah um also guys let us know in the comments any kind of builds that you're interested in learning about so that we have a rough idea about what you want to build what you want to go ahead and see in future builds let us know um oh [ __ ] is that right now right now bro oh dumb holy [ __ ] holy [ __ ] this um this is like probably the most controversial live stream we've ever done yeah it's definitely getting demonetized sandeep dust says just spent eight hours yesterday making the facebook come from your channel and today seven hours making the twitter clone with firebase you guys rock that's crazy dude while you're on that spree try ahead and beat us to the next video and get the react native firebase library set up and running um and try and do like some kind of authentication with that before we drop the video yeah that would be a good challenge for everyone to actually go ahead and do um that would be awesome sick now i can't go back bro oh okay the only way through is to log in yeah got it yeah so that's what we kind of like we sort of like you know kind of uh protected against that um so that was a kind of a dummy login scenario and the reason being is because we haven't set up xcode and there's a bunch of xcode work that we need to do to get that installed um but once that's done what we can do is we'll get this out because now we're on the new imac so the next time we go live we'll actually have the simulator up and running so they'll be able to see dude how the simulator will be we'll be seeing it you know got it okay i'm sick um dude i want to get that book on um there's this book on something about resistance like um i hope i can find it it's supposed to be pretty sick i don't know i just thought about it right now like working through resistance um it's none of these not what was this for resistance it's a book i i think it kind of talks about like how to work through resistance so doing things that are really hard i just got inspired because i thought about it i'm like we're setting these goals like for example even you and i we have the workout goals where we want to hit 20 workouts or 30 workouts yeah and then we have the goals of okay 15 live streams and i want to actually train my brain on actually actively looking to work through resistance and this book is actually really great on this except i just can't think of its name damn does anyone know in the comments maybe the book he's talking about let us know or let us know any books that you guys find generally quite useful that have impacted you um right now i'm listening to think like a monk have you have you read that book by j shay i'm uh i'm reading that as well actually that's a really good book yeah but you know i after he got to the part about negativity then it got pretty generic so i just [ __ ] quit out of it i got bored like yeah it went it went a bit kind of down and then it comes back up in the later chapter the start was like really profound where he's like breath is all you have they teach you breathing even if you i'm like okay that's deep that was sick i felt a certain way then it got really like a dad talking to his son about naked negativity is bad you have complainers that complain and complaining is bad i'm like [ __ ] know that dude yeah i switched to uh uh i switched to 10x yeah yeah yeah like i got sick of that [ __ ] thing it was a bit soft and i was like i kind of need someone to slap me with some but brochures mean the breathing the breathing thing was actually really good uh that that was actually a kind of a gold little nugget in that book um kind of very easily overlooked but yeah like uh that was that's pretty bob builder says a book called profit with javascript has greatly helped me you guys should check it out nice holy [ __ ] that's a great book that's a great book man um however if i is it do the workbook why is it do the workbook by stephen pressfield um no not that one and i went through jordan peterson's 12 rules of life but i don't know just didn't do the trick for me and uh yeah ranbir says his books are david goggins was really good but they can't hurt me that was sick that was actually a lot of uh that helped help me go [ __ ] nuts oh yeah at the gym and i was doing pretty epic [ __ ] so that one was really good and uh right now what i'm reading is the one thing the one thing i actually bought the um atomic havocs atomic habits was a total game changer for me that one was huge i i heard you guys talk about it quite a lot so i grabbed that yeah that that really had an impact yeah exactly devon grace i just bought thing like a monk don't tell me i got over 10 already i honestly i think it's not a bad book i'd say give it a read um but like there is a bit after the negativity that does become a bit generic and then there is a bit where i find it picks up but like i would say give it give it a chance i won't say it's a waste no it's definitely yeah yeah like especially the start of it i felt was phenomenal like the start of it alone makes the book worth it so go through that hopefully that inspires you exactly books by ab adam badoush what to say when you talk to yourself um damn oh man yeah look i look in the mirror and i'm like bro you look jacked i have really good selftalk to be honest nice it's like affirmations right yeah but like i i honestly i'm not even thinking affirmations like i just have um i just don't a lot of people are really hard on themselves i'm not that hard on myself at all so like i usually don't have a really strong negative selftalk yeah um i would say i suffered the opposite i'm quite harsh on myself really yeah i would say i'm really kind of like you know like even if you're on a streak i kind of i'm always like attacking it's very hard to feel like [ __ ] oh just that's funny dude that's crazy i mean that's hard yeah that's why the um that's why that breathing thing was really good because because like when you get overwhelmed and stuff like you j says like the only thing you control like from the point that you're you're born to the point you die is your breath like it's with you throughout and it's true like when you're stressed out when you're anxious or anything just start breathing and and it really does like change like you know like just taking a few breaths can bring you present it can change everything in a second so that that was a bit of a game changer yeah that's true yeah that's crazy dude i i never understand why certain people's selftalk is really like like strong against themselves but most of the times when i'm watching something of myself or looking at i'm like yeah damn cool like you know i'll be like oh that's pretty cool nice job bro yeah i i feel like that with the youtube streams dude when i'm watching about the streams then i feel pretty good then i'm like yeah that's sick like when we're talking and stuff so that's a really healthy way of carrying on with that but you're gonna say something were you inside no i was just gonna add on to that because i feel that people are really hard on themselves which makes you less likely to improve to be honest yeah um but i think a good balance where if you can objectively look at it like i think when you start to look at yourself a lot on youtube like how you and i do a lot of videos we can watch it i think you get desensitized to yourself and you start becoming less cringed out by yourself so yeah it's 100 you know what i mean because you have this picture in your mind and then when you see yourself for the first few times like what the [ __ ] like i don't i'm not like that at all how i think i am in my head and then in reality i say this like really stupidly or i come off like a [ __ ] here when i say this and you go okay so in the start i was really harsh but then the more i now i'm like pretty desensitized to myself because i've seen myself so much so i can actually see it just like i see another person and usually when i see another person i'm not like really harsh on you know thinking about them i'm like oh it's cool it's another person doing their thing yeah it's it's so true i remember the first time i went live i was like oh it's so hard like it may sound like the simplest thing just be yourself but like being yourself on camera and on live streams and stuff that is actually really tricky and it just takes it takes repetition of you just kind of getting bored of caring about how you look and feel on camera that's funny yeah and then and then eventually your your true self comes out and that's what everyone attaches to they're just attached to you being you and and the only way you get that and most people and this is something i got stuck at i always thought like oh no it has to be perfect the lighting has to be perfect the camera has to be perfect and then you just like screw all that [ __ ] just do it and keep doing it and then it just overcomes you know like you don't then you get out of that rut that you get stuck in i agree i'm reading um deep emotional things with kazzy and sunny um i just read the comment but yeah i think that just going and getting used to it until it's not a new thing for your body that helps tremendously yeah and gypsum also guys if you didn't know me and kazi just set a new massive goal for live streams because you don't tell them yeah it's kind of a lot actually we are planning to hit a base goal of 12 live streams and a reach goal of 15 in november yeah and what's cool is we started off november really strong so we've already this is our second live stream yeah so two livestreams tonight yeah so so far i feel we're crushing it and if we just keep going at this dude we're i'm excited about getting on twitch dude that's what i'm excited about yeah because twitch is like native to us streaming and you know all of that stuff so i think we we could definitely tap in with twitch yeah and uh and also we're gonna be upgrading the stream like well we we've we've been wanting to dive into this thing right about creating the stream uh we're going to push ourselves and it's pretty much a case of like it'll be a fun interactive stream yeah it will be and i think what we'll do is the next time we plan to go live let's just do it then yeah so we'll just get on an hour earlier and then work on it yeah let's do that 100 i'll be sick dope all right broski so we are at login and now what we're trying to do is get the login functionality to work so we put up a dummy login functionality and that seems like it's working and i'm able to log in so yeah that's pretty great i'm able to add my income and it actually shows it on the map that's also pretty cool yeah uh what's next for us we're a little bit stuck because ideally what we would have wanted to do is have it so we used firebase authentication um to go ahead and log us in and and cache that login and then we would store the information the reason being is we could do it with pure javascript but i would like to do it with um yeah so do you want to uh what do you want to do do you want to like do that work behind the scenes so then we figure it out like we can get started earlier next time and then just make it work ideal use case would be that okay cool yeah because then because what we're going to need we're going to need to crack that side of things cool and then get it all set up and stuff like that um i don't i think it would work if we did this way but the problem is that if we do it the way that we're previously doing it you're gonna get like a glitchy experience it's gonna be like you're gonna go into the app and then it's gonna like it's gonna make a request find out that you're logged in and then log you in you don't want that you want to kind of log you in cache it so that way when you come back to the app it knows you're logged in rather than doing that you know that kind of two second delay thing yep yeah cool so let's pick up next time then and wrap it up and then we can work on that and also maybe work on twitch yeah yeah so we can work on twitch and upgrade the stream and the authentication yeah so okay bro sounds good let's actually work on it and then yeah i'm getting pretty excited to talk with david and amanus too on the ad side yeah that would be sick so fishing outside yeah yeah so we can actually spend certain days uh even going on ads or giving them some strategy with it but i'm really excited about that yeah that would be awesome all right things are crazy yeah these are being this exciting stuff coming your way guys yeah it's i'm i'm excited all right guys hopefully you guys enjoyed this stream where we're learning react native together with you
