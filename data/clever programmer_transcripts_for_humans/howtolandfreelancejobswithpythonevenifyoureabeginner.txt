00:09 - off those lights right there please
00:42 - so look at how easy they made it okay
00:54 - you
01:09 - what's up guys how's it going this is
01:12 - Kazi from clever programmer dot-com
01:15 - welcome to this epic livestream and in
01:19 - this video we're gonna be talking about
01:21 - how to land freelancing jobs with Python
01:26 - even if you're a complete beginner and
01:29 - actually what I'm gonna be doing and I
01:30 - was talking with my friend Frankie are
01:33 - you guys able to hear me now you guys
01:35 - should be able to hear me now if you can
01:36 - hear me please confirm and if you could
01:38 - please man the chat that would be
01:40 - fantastic
01:41 - so what I wanted to share with you and
01:43 - this is like I want to get real with you
01:46 - in this video I want to get raw with you
01:48 - and I want to show you exactly where to
01:51 - go and how to land clients where to find
01:53 - them what type of jobs to look for in
01:56 - this live stream I'm gonna share you the
01:59 - number one secret pitfall that almost
02:02 - every Python up-and-coming developer or
02:05 - anybody who wants to be a freelancer
02:08 - falls into and why they're never
02:11 - make any money and I'll show you
02:12 - specifically what that means and I'll
02:14 - also show you how you can avoid that and
02:16 - actually earn a real income with Python
02:19 - and coding and in this video we're gonna
02:22 - be doing less of talking and I'm gonna
02:25 - be doing more of showing so this means
02:27 - the actual resources that I'm using and
02:30 - the right place to go what type of jobs
02:34 - to look at and where can you actually
02:37 - apply and how much money you can be
02:40 - earning as well I'm also gonna be
02:42 - showing you specifically what type of
02:43 - Python job opportunities exist how much
02:47 - people are paying for them as well as a
02:49 - freelancer because I realized for most
02:52 - of the audience and for most of the
02:54 - people can you use a laptop instead of
02:56 - your phone you don't need an
03:02 - administrator if you can just go live
03:03 - that'd be great just so you can monitor
03:05 - it and see if you can hear it and if
03:08 - people can hear it you know okay
03:13 - alright awesome Thank You G that's my
03:17 - new style you know I got I wanted to go
03:19 - clean No More Homeless anymore alright
03:24 - okay so all right guys let's keep the
03:31 - chat clean guys let's be respectful for
03:34 - everybody that's here we want to make it
03:36 - a high quality live stream for everyone
03:39 - so if you're in the chat and you're
03:42 - acting like an idiot and ruining the
03:44 - experience for everyone who's viewing it
03:47 - we will just kick you out or block you
03:49 - but what I want to do is I want to give
03:51 - you guys massive amounts of value on
03:53 - this live stream all right so it's all
03:55 - for free you're all you're gonna get
03:57 - this value right here right now all
04:00 - right so let's jump right into it with
04:02 - all these things said okay we're gonna
04:04 - get started pretty much right away now
04:08 - what everybody makes it seem like is
04:10 - that getting a freaking job or getting a
04:14 - freelancing opportunity to requires you
04:16 - to have multiple degrees requires you to
04:21 - have years of experience a PhD I
04:24 - don't know what most of these developers
04:26 - say but most of the developers make it
04:28 - seem like rocket science and while there
04:31 - are certain aspects of programming that
04:33 - are actually rocket science specifically
04:35 - if you're working with NASA most things
04:38 - are actually not that hard okay they're
04:41 - a lot easier for you to get started in
04:44 - and especially if you're new you can get
04:46 - started in a lot quicker so I'm gonna
04:51 - show you guys and we're gonna pick
04:52 - things apart live as well okay so here's
04:55 - what we're gonna do I'm gonna open up my
04:57 - document and in this document I'm also
05:01 - gonna show you what type of
05:02 - opportunities never to kind of fall for
05:04 - and go after because they're pretty much
05:06 - just traps and I'm gonna show you what
05:09 - things to go after so let's do this
05:13 - we're gonna do this we're gonna send
05:16 - this one over alright so now you guys
05:18 - should be seeing the live stream and or
05:23 - sorry my screen hopefully and a Frank if
05:26 - you can double check that if people are
05:27 - seeing my screen pretty soon that would
05:29 - be great
05:29 - but I'll keep going alright so I want to
05:32 - give you examples of real-world
05:34 - opportunities on a plateau
05:36 - like up work okay so if you guys don't
05:38 - know what up work is you go to Google
05:39 - Chrome comm you type in upwork.com and
05:43 - this is where you can get freelancing
05:45 - jobs all right so you would go to where
05:48 - it says jobs you would type in Python
05:50 - and you would type it in correctly
05:53 - unlike me and depending on different
05:55 - parts of the world you would either hit
05:57 - this off or you would hit this on okay
06:00 - and let's go down and here you would
06:03 - look for opportunities that you could
06:05 - actually do as a Python developer so
06:08 - check this out okay we have bunch of job
06:11 - opportunities here I'm on this live page
06:13 - hopefully everybody can view this I'll
06:15 - zoom in a little bit more now you're
06:18 - gonna look for opportunities you're
06:19 - gonna cancel out a lot of the things you
06:21 - can't do or maybe you don't have the
06:22 - skill set to do and that's fine maybe
06:24 - you look here DJI SDK Raspberry Pi I
06:28 - don't know how to do this I
06:30 - don't know what DJI is like a drone and
06:32 - working with Raspberry Pi I have no
06:35 - experience working with drones or
06:36 - Raspberry Pi so I'll skip this but now
06:40 - let's go down and I'll probably skip
06:43 - lunar and fertility calculator all right
06:47 - might be interesting to read it but I'm
06:49 - gonna skip that because you know also
06:51 - you have to be expert it's probably
06:53 - require some very specific knowledge
06:54 - maybe it's not a good fit let's keep
06:56 - going full sex off for engineers skip
06:59 - skip skip but now let's take a look at
07:01 - this one okay
07:02 - Python scrapey spider to retrieve PDF
07:06 - links we need three Python scrapy
07:10 - spiders to crawl three different domains
07:14 - and return the names and full URLs of
07:17 - all PDF files on the domain we do not
07:20 - need to download the PDFs only create a
07:23 - list of their names and full URLs must
07:25 - be written in Python alright so what is
07:28 - this person actually asking now it might
07:31 - sound like rocket science but all this
07:36 - person is asking is can you write a
07:40 - Python code that can go to all these web
07:43 - sites and literally pull all the URLs
07:47 - that say dot PDF at the end
07:50 - that's it so if you go to website and
07:54 - you see a URL on there that ends in dot
07:57 - html' don't write that one locally but
08:01 - only write a list of ones that end with
08:03 - dot PDF
08:04 - so all this person is asking is hey
08:06 - write a Python piece of code that can
08:08 - pull all the PDF URLs from the three
08:12 - different websites I give you so for
08:14 - example if I gave you clever programmer
08:16 - com your Python script should be able to
08:18 - go all over clever programmer comm and
08:20 - find all of the PDF links if I gave you
08:25 - Apple comm it should be able to go all
08:28 - through Apple comm and find all the PDF
08:30 - links that's it that's it for this job
08:36 - how much are they paying for this
08:38 - particular job they are paying three
08:40 - hundred dollars so let me zoom in just
08:43 - actually zoom out just a little bit
08:45 - right there you can see it's a three
08:47 - hundred dollar job you could actually
08:49 - apply for it right here right now all
08:52 - right and these people are legit
08:55 - look at where it says $30,000 right so
08:58 - you that's that's generally what you
08:59 - want to look at if you're looking to
09:01 - apply for a job you don't necessarily
09:05 - want to apply to just any job right like
09:09 - here it says your dollar spent payment
09:11 - unverified this person could just be
09:14 - lying or this person probably has no
09:17 - record of hiring people so we don't we
09:19 - don't have enough data but somebody who
09:21 - spent thirty thousand dollars paying
09:25 - other people to work with them they're
09:27 - most likely not playing around so if
09:30 - you're working with them you're gonna be
09:32 - at least making three hundred dollars or
09:33 - more for this particular task now if
09:37 - you're somebody who has cool social
09:41 - skills you could get this particular job
09:43 - and you could hand this job off to
09:47 - somebody who knows how to do it so you
09:49 - could hire a developer from somewhere
09:50 - and make sure that they do this project
09:52 - while you just manage them all right so
09:55 - then you can get profit but you don't
09:59 - even necessarily have to be that good at
10:01 - coding so that's an alternative even if
10:04 - you're not
10:04 - that great of a developer if you're a
10:05 - complete beginner but to be honest to do
10:08 - this project if you even have a little
10:11 - bit of skill in Python like let's say
10:13 - you're past the beginner phase or more
10:15 - intermediate like it says this is a
10:17 - project that you could do very
10:18 - realistically okay so that's one example
10:21 - let's go down and see maybe if there are
10:23 - any other examples that we can see right
10:25 - off the bat so okay let's see this one
10:29 - let me go to the chat first and see
10:32 - what's going on what are people saying
10:33 - in the chat how to use Python are we
10:41 - mark okay great awesome
10:44 - can I see your screen hello
10:47 - okay all right whatever so here I am on
10:53 - this page and you can see it says scrape
10:59 - two sites
11:00 - walk me through so now check this out
11:02 - okay this guy goes I know how to do
11:05 - basic scraping with Python and
11:07 - beautifulsoup I want you to show me how
11:11 - to do a couple of trickier sites or best
11:13 - of all show me how to access an API
11:16 - please note I am not paying you to do it
11:19 - for me so this guy's not even he doesn't
11:22 - even need you to do anything for him he
11:24 - just says I'm paying you to show me how
11:26 - to do it you can give me written
11:29 - instructions but I'd prefer a zoom
11:31 - meeting where we can walk through it
11:33 - together
11:33 - so he's even willing to not even meet
11:36 - with you in person or online or on a
11:38 - one-on-one call he's even okay with the
11:40 - written instructions and he says these
11:43 - are not work-related sites that are
11:45 - gathering information for my fantasy
11:46 - baseball team so he literally wants to
11:49 - hire someone to help him do some web
11:53 - scraping with Python and beautifulsoup
11:54 - for his freakin fantasy baseball team
11:57 - and he's verified here and he's paid
11:59 - people over he's paid a total of over
12:01 - $60 so unlike so it's not a scam it's
12:04 - somebody who's real who's spent real
12:07 - money and all he wants is somebody to
12:10 - walk him through so even if you're
12:12 - pretty much a beginner and you just go
12:14 - through a little bit of training with me
12:16 - on
12:17 - Python and beautifulsoup words or web
12:19 - scraping you can actually work with this
12:21 - person and land this person as your
12:23 - client and they'll be paying you 30 or
12:25 - 50 or $60 an hour so you work with this
12:28 - person for three or four hours that's
12:30 - two hundred three hundred dollars right
12:32 - there for you now before I continue
12:33 - further I do want to know if this is
12:35 - valuable for you is this been helpful so
12:37 - far I'm gonna stop my screen share for
12:40 - just a second all right cool hmm so all
12:58 - right now all this stuff that I'm
13:01 - sharing with you guys right over here we
13:05 - created our new program right around
13:07 - this whole thing because what we want to
13:09 - be able to do for you is I want you to
13:12 - be able to go to these exact jobs learn
13:15 - these exact skills and be able to land
13:18 - clients okay because most of the people
13:21 - they have skills but they have random
13:24 - freaking skills right but how cool would
13:26 - it be if somebody literally okay
13:29 - let me go back to that how cool would it
13:34 - be if somebody literally shows you like
13:36 - if I bring you in and I go we're gonna
13:39 - do this exact project this person is
13:41 - asking for then I'm gonna show you how
13:43 - to go to this exact client on upward
13:45 - exactly what to say to this person and
13:48 - then land this person as your client how
13:51 - cool would it be if somebody just went
13:53 - okay hey man you see this project right
13:59 - over here this Python scrapey spider one
14:02 - yeah I'm gonna show you exactly how to
14:04 - make it so we make it somewhere in a
14:06 - program we make this full project and
14:10 - then I show you exactly how to reach out
14:13 - to this client and how to land this
14:14 - client and then how to solve this
14:16 - problem for them that's essentially what
14:21 - I wanted to do in this new program that
14:22 - we have launched and it's called
14:24 - automate with Python like a badass and
14:27 - that program allows you to
14:30 - land freelancing jobs on platforms like
14:33 - upward comm start earning an income even
14:37 - if you're a complete beginner that is
14:40 - the goal but the new program that we
14:41 - just launched let's go through a few
14:45 - more examples okay so I have a few
14:48 - examples and I want also give you
14:50 - examples of what what not to do all
14:52 - right what type of jobs are bad for
14:54 - example so let's take a look at this job
14:57 - the guy says need help building
15:00 - restaurant app now somebody he needs his
15:06 - entry level that's pretty cool and he
15:08 - goes I'm developing an online
15:10 - application for my family's restaurant
15:12 - I'm an IT graduate certified in computer
15:15 - programming and I will be leading the
15:16 - project I'm interested in working with
15:18 - local developers bla bla bla bla bla bla
15:21 - bla I just kind of skipped over it and
15:23 - then he goes when I plan on meeting I
15:25 - would prefer that the developers are
15:26 - present because sometimes I'll be
15:28 - meeting with investors please send me a
15:30 - message your experience dah dah dah dah
15:33 - dah okay let me ask you a question if
15:38 - you're watching this stream drop it in
15:40 - the chat below right now is this a good
15:43 - job opportunity or is this a bad job
15:46 - opportunity this is a good freelancing
15:48 - opportunity or a bad freelancing
15:50 - opportunity and I want you to critically
15:52 - think and tell me why don't just look at
15:54 - my answer right over here at the
15:56 - top but like give me a reason as how you
15:59 - would reason with it and why I'm gonna
16:01 - jump into the chat now and see what
16:03 - you've come up with so tell me what you
16:05 - think about this
16:12 - our be within this is useful
16:26 - okay some people say no what seems says
16:29 - no Ola says low-rate vishal says no calm
16:35 - mel says good and bad both ELISA $0
16:38 - spent Tanisha says no money spent okay
16:41 - this is really great thank you guys for
16:43 - participating okay I love that thank you
16:46 - so much Abdul Majeed says because your
16:47 - dollar spent this is not good because
16:50 - too many demands and no money spent thus
16:53 - far Eclair okay Siobhan says big no-no
16:56 - money spent
16:58 - Akash says title and step description is
17:01 - not good small steps nope no build this
17:04 - out with PHP gonna be in the
17:06 - pain-in-the-ass Christopher says Robert
17:09 - says $0 spent very vague description bad
17:12 - because too many texts and he seems not
17:14 - reliable no exact income he's fake okay
17:18 - looks like you guys are on the right
17:20 - track so that's fantastic guys by the
17:22 - way thank you for everybody who just
17:24 - spent that much time engaging with it
17:26 - you're much more likely to make way more
17:29 -  money than a lot of the people
17:30 - who are on this livestream but not
17:32 - participating I still love you but these
17:35 - are the things that get you to actually
17:38 - understand a lot of these concepts this
17:40 - is what makes the difference between you
17:42 - getting these clients and not getting
17:43 - these clients and wash these clients be
17:46 - taken by somebody else so thank you for
17:48 - that level of initiative that level of
17:49 - participation because it also makes it a
17:51 - lot more fun for me so thank you for
17:53 - that okay so now I'm gonna go back and
17:56 - I'm gonna give you guys my thoughts on
17:59 - it would you guys like to hear my
18:00 - thoughts on this it's a trick question
18:04 - cuz share it anyway alright let's go so
18:09 - go right here okay
18:13 - so here's why I personally say no so
18:16 - first of all I agree with everyone this
18:18 - guy first of all has no ratings so
18:21 - there's zero stars that he has so that's
18:23 - the first flag for me another flag for
18:27 - me that's pretty huge is that he has
18:29 - spent $0 so far but now here's the big
18:32 - red flag for me he sounds like every
18:35 -  loser who has an idea for an app
18:38 - and
18:39 - they're gonna be meeting with investors
18:41 - and they're trying to sell you some pipe
18:43 - dream of something that doesn't yet
18:44 - exist he doesn't have a prototype
18:47 - he hasn't built anything yet he says I
18:50 - plan to wrap it up and go native I plan
18:53 - to make this I'm thinking about making
18:56 - this maybe I'll be meeting with
18:58 - investors one day
18:59 - there's nothing yet there are no
19:02 - investors yet this person is an IT
19:04 - graduate certified in computer
19:06 - programming okay he doesn't even
19:09 - have a job so it doesn't mean that his
19:14 - idea doesn't have potential it doesn't
19:16 - mean that this might not be the next
19:18 - Facebook it just mean that the odds of
19:20 - all of that are very low and there's no
19:22 - security or any reliability all of us
19:26 - follow the data you have your life is
19:28 - very important guys your time is very
19:31 - important so going down a rabbit hole
19:33 - like this which a lot of freelancers do
19:35 - you will be so surprised so many
19:38 - freelancers will go down this path and
19:40 - there will be so confused and they
19:42 - didn't get any money
19:43 - this guy's not trying to scam you this
19:45 - is a person with good intentions but you
19:47 - are going to not make any money from
19:50 - this or very little money because this
19:53 - person has no money to give you he's a
19:55 - graduate he doesn't even have a job so
19:56 - we're he's gonna give you money from
19:58 - okay and investors and all that stuff is
20:01 - most likely a pipe dream if you get in
20:05 - any Ober car every bird driver you know
20:08 - what I'm talking about every bird driver
20:09 - has like a freaking app idea right you
20:12 - know like all those people everybody has
20:14 - right and all these people have no
20:16 - record for it for their results like why
20:19 - are you working a $7 an hour job
20:22 - but you have this amazing app idea like
20:24 - you should have you should have had
20:26 - something prior to that right like you
20:28 - should have had maybe a business prior
20:29 - to that you should have some kind of
20:31 - track record right then maybe your idea
20:33 - is more believable people want to get
20:34 - behind it so stay away from this is a
20:38 - trap this type of stuff okay again I'm
20:41 - not saying oh it's a scam or anything
20:42 - but I'm just saying that even though
20:45 - this person has good intentions
20:46 - you want to be really intelligent as a
20:48 - freelancer as a developer so then you
20:50 - that you could get paid what you're
20:52 - worth
20:53 - not be undermined and overworked okay so
20:58 - that is what I would say to that let me
21:00 - go and see what people are saying in the
21:02 - live chat because I want to make sure I
21:03 - engage with with you guys all right of
21:08 - course not
21:09 - zero income bla bla bla bla bla why not
21:15 - okay
21:18 - okay let's see
21:27 - okay what are people saying
21:32 - so no lurking yep yep all right so some
21:39 - people asked in the in some people email
21:42 - me from this livestream and they asked
21:43 - hey is this class so when you join this
21:48 - class guys you have access to when you
21:50 - join automate with Python the new
21:52 - program that we just launched you
21:53 - actually have access to it for a
21:55 - lifetime alright this is not you don't
21:57 - have access to for a little bit so even
21:59 - though it's a module program and we're
22:02 - only gonna add more modules to help you
22:04 - start earning an income because the
22:05 - whole point of the program is to take
22:07 - you from zero to start landing these
22:09 - specific clients I'm showing you an up
22:11 - work we want to make it that brain-dead
22:12 - simple for you and your return on
22:14 - investment when I make it that brain
22:16 - that simple but yeah so essentially once
22:19 - you join you're gonna have access to it
22:21 - for ever okay it's not like you just and
22:25 - you can take it at your own pace as well
22:26 - so I just wanted to mention that now let
22:30 - me continue and show you guys some other
22:33 - examples so let's go and do this let's
22:38 - go and do this
22:39 - let's go boom alright here's another
22:42 - good here's another job opportunity and
22:45 - you guys judge this and let me know what
22:47 - you guys think so this guy says Python
22:49 - beginner homework help needed hello this
22:52 - is an unconventional post from my
22:55 - company one of our customers need some
22:59 - help for high school homework in Python
23:02 - good English skill is a must can hire
23:05 - immediately so if it were you and let's
23:10 - say you are either a complete beginner
23:12 - or you have just a little bit of skill
23:13 - in Python or whatever the case may be
23:16 - would you take the time to apply to this
23:18 - or not
23:19 - Oh give me yes or no but also give me a
23:23 - critical thinking and your reason behind
23:25 - it okay I'm gonna read everybody's
23:27 - comment in the live stream and then
23:29 - we're gonna go from there so what do you
23:31 - think would you apply to this
23:32 - opportunity or not this was posted one
23:35 - day ago and yeah yep so let's see let's
23:40 - see what you guys say
23:52 - alright let's see what's going on Carla
23:57 - says let's do another example
23:59 - damn Carlos is excited how to write
24:02 - description how to write skill
24:04 - description up work will seem we also
24:05 - show you that in our program how do you
24:07 - write your skill description in up work
24:09 - alright so if those are the questions
24:12 - you want to ask that are very technical
24:13 - everything is covered in the course I
24:15 - would suggest you at least check it out
24:18 - okay alright let's see what's going on
24:21 - thanks for the info Robert says David
24:23 - Roberts and Snagit now ok Python and
24:27 - JavaScript worth more okay so somebody
24:32 - says Christopher says why not cool Mikey
24:37 - says yes seems good for a beginner Dino
24:40 - says you will do something like that for
24:41 - free cuz I can't pay that much
24:43 - no Camila is still suspicious comments
24:47 - all the suspicious gig look suspicious
24:49 - UNK it says knows your star and not
24:51 - challenging Carlos says yes he will do
24:55 - it because it says $600 spent and
24:57 - requires English okay say it says
25:00 - definitely yes came an 12:30 says yes
25:04 - payment history is there Loco
25:07 - lightning says maybe only thing does not
25:08 - have much info Shawn says to be honest I
25:12 - won't because he's not specific about
25:13 - the problem Robert says any good
25:15 - reference is a worthwhile investment
25:17 - okay
25:18 - all right I do it if it's an up front or
25:21 - at least secured by third party Bruna
25:23 - says they have no rating that spent 600
25:27 - I'd go for it
25:27 - okay cool
25:30 - Claire says I would apply alright so
25:32 - let's see here's how I would answer it
25:37 - there's no clear right or wrong answer
25:39 - sometimes there is but I'll just give
25:42 - you my thoughts behind it so you guys
25:45 - can see how I would kind of tackle
25:46 - thinking about this okay
25:48 - all right whoops
25:54 - okay so here's how I would kind of think
25:57 - about this Python beginner homework help
25:59 - needed now if I was in the or position
26:02 - where I was looking for a client and to
26:05 - work with someone and I want to just be
26:07 - able to live my own lifestyle right like
26:08 - I'm living in Hollywood I want to work
26:11 - remotely I want to be able to kind of
26:14 - have my own lifestyle choose my own
26:15 - hours have my own clients kind of earn
26:17 - an income and then choose my ability to
26:19 - hire and fire clients and I saw this now
26:22 - be like hmm
26:23 - skill level can't be that hard it's high
26:25 - school homework I have good English
26:28 - they're looking to hire immediately they
26:31 - are payment verified they have already
26:34 - spent over six hundred dollars for me
26:40 - depends on your interest right if this
26:43 - is genuinely not interesting to you then
26:45 - maybe don't do it I love working with
26:48 - people I love teaching I love explaining
26:52 - things it deepens my knowledge it also I
26:56 - love seeing the transformation that
26:58 - takes place in people and you change the
27:00 - trajectory of their entire life so for
27:04 - me that's what's really powerful and
27:05 - magnetic about this being able to have
27:08 - that opportunity and then privileged and
27:10 - outside of that I'm getting paid for
27:13 - this as well
27:14 - so it's a win on many different
27:17 - spectrums and now if I have another
27:20 - client who I like less I can fire that
27:23 - client or I can choose to up my rates
27:26 - with that client it gives me more
27:27 - options so you want to have your power
27:30 - comes from the number of options you
27:31 - have okay so this is you know if if
27:36 - you're talking about the dating world
27:38 - and if you guys have options of which
27:42 - girl you could hang out with or make her
27:45 - your girlfriend or your wife right you
27:48 - get to choose who you want to be with
27:50 - but if you don't have that option you
27:53 - will go with literally whoever is there
27:55 - available for you sometimes people get
27:58 - into a relationship and stay in that
28:00 -  relationship for a long time out
28:02 - of convenience and out of having no
28:04 - options all right so you
28:07 - to always be the person who's in the
28:09 - position where you're choosing from a
28:11 - position of power rather than that of
28:14 - weakness then when you commit to a
28:16 - relationship then you really commit or
28:18 - if you commit to a client then you
28:20 - really commit so in this case I would
28:23 - say this would be a yes okay this is a
28:26 - great opportunity all right let's see
28:31 - what people have said before I continue
28:33 - any further let's go right there throw
28:37 - my face back on go here bada BAM bada
28:41 - boom let's see what people are saying
28:43 - all right
28:45 - paying well okay cool
28:48 - David is down for it say is genuine
28:51 - client Geetha's yes it is good for
28:55 - Python beginners Claire says yes I would
28:57 - also enjoy teaching explaining concept
28:59 - which eventually resonates with the
29:01 - student awesome Carlos says power
29:03 - choices comes from a mind set up of
29:05 - abundance exactly okay cool
29:10 - so all right cool okay hopefully I think
29:17 - hopefully for you guys this has been
29:19 - valuable so far this was something new
29:22 - that I wanted to do I'd never done this
29:24 - before I wanted to give it a try and see
29:26 - how you guys like it to be honest this
29:30 - is super if I was in that position this
29:32 - would have been massively valuable for
29:34 - me that's why I shared it because if I
29:37 - was back in the day where I was looking
29:39 - for clients and wanted to know how I
29:40 - could do it I would love to be able to
29:42 - just see exactly what I need to do okay
29:45 - so again if you guys are here and
29:47 - interested in all this stuff so far I'm
29:48 - gonna talk about how to automate with
29:50 - Python like a badass our brand new
29:53 - program that we just launched me and my
29:55 - entire team we worked on it and in that
29:58 - program we literally take these types of
30:01 - jobs from up work we complete them as
30:04 - projects that you can have on your
30:05 - portfolio and then we show you how you
30:07 - can go to these clients on up work how
30:10 - do you build a profile how do you go and
30:12 - reach out to these clients and how do
30:14 - you land these types of clients for
30:16 - these exact jobs so we don't want to
30:19 - just teach you
30:20 - random automation stuff that you
30:21 - can find on udemy.com
30:23 - or you can find on you know YouTube
30:26 - anywhere we want to give you the real
30:29 - stuff that you can actually apply in
30:31 - real life and actually get results and
30:33 - go to these practical jobs and get them
30:35 - done so we wanted to keep it as real
30:37 - world as practical as possible for you
30:39 - that's why I wanted to do this live
30:41 - stream and share with you everything
30:42 - live so you could see how this works
30:45 - okay this is why I believe it's so
30:47 - important to be just transparent and
30:48 - authentic with you guys in raw and
30:50 - instead of making some fancy video and
30:53 - sharing this with you guys I just wanted
30:54 - to share this with you one on one just
30:57 - me and you okay hopefully you found this
30:59 - valuable if you are interested in this
31:01 - definitely click the link in the
31:02 - description for the automate with Python
31:05 - like a badass course and at the very
31:07 - least just check it out we have an
31:09 - amazing video there for you to see you
31:11 - can also learn more about the program
31:13 - and see if it's a good fit for you if
31:15 - it's not you don't need to join it if it
31:17 - seems like a good fit for you you're
31:19 - interested in working as a remote
31:21 - developer kind of having your own
31:22 - lifestyle working as a freelancer and
31:24 - just becoming a badass at Python in
31:27 - general then definitely go check out
31:30 - this program we'll show you how to crush
31:32 - it as a Python freelancer in 2019 and
31:34 - beyond thank you guys so much for being
31:36 - here I love your face and as always I'm
31:39 - gonna see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

Frankie I'm going live right now turn off those lights right there please so look at how easy they made it okay you what's up guys how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer dotcom welcome to this epic livestream and in this video we're gonna be talking about how to land freelancing jobs with Python even if you're a complete beginner and actually what I'm gonna be doing and I was talking with my friend Frankie are you guys able to hear me now you guys should be able to hear me now if you can hear me please confirm and if you could please man the chat that would be fantastic so what I wanted to share with you and this is like I want to get real with you in this video I want to get raw with you and I want to show you exactly where to go and how to land clients where to find them what type of jobs to look for in this live stream I'm gonna share you the number one secret pitfall that almost every Python upandcoming developer or anybody who wants to be a freelancer falls into and why they're never make any money and I'll show you specifically what that means and I'll also show you how you can avoid that and actually earn a real income with Python and coding and in this video we're gonna be doing less of talking and I'm gonna be doing more of showing so this means the actual resources that I'm using and the right place to go what type of jobs to look at and where can you actually apply and how much money you can be earning as well I'm also gonna be showing you specifically what type of Python job opportunities exist how much people are paying for them as well as a freelancer because I realized for most of the audience and for most of the people can you use a laptop instead of your phone you don't need an administrator if you can just go live that'd be great just so you can monitor it and see if you can hear it and if people can hear it you know okay alright awesome Thank You G that's my new style you know I got I wanted to go clean No More Homeless anymore alright okay so all right guys let's keep the chat clean guys let's be respectful for everybody that's here we want to make it a high quality live stream for everyone so if you're in the chat and you're acting like an idiot and ruining the experience for everyone who's viewing it we will just kick you out or block you but what I want to do is I want to give you guys massive amounts of value on this live stream all right so it's all for free you're all you're gonna get this value right here right now all right so let's jump right into it with all these things said okay we're gonna get started pretty much right away now what everybody makes it seem like is that getting a freaking job or getting a freelancing opportunity to requires you to have multiple degrees requires you to have years of experience a PhD I don't know what most of these developers say but most of the developers make it seem like rocket science and while there are certain aspects of programming that are actually rocket science specifically if you're working with NASA most things are actually not that hard okay they're a lot easier for you to get started in and especially if you're new you can get started in a lot quicker so I'm gonna show you guys and we're gonna pick things apart live as well okay so here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna open up my document and in this document I'm also gonna show you what type of opportunities never to kind of fall for and go after because they're pretty much just traps and I'm gonna show you what things to go after so let's do this we're gonna do this we're gonna send this one over alright so now you guys should be seeing the live stream and or sorry my screen hopefully and a Frank if you can double check that if people are seeing my screen pretty soon that would be great but I'll keep going alright so I want to give you examples of realworld opportunities on a plateau like up work okay so if you guys don't know what up work is you go to Google Chrome comm you type in upwork.com and this is where you can get freelancing jobs all right so you would go to where it says jobs you would type in Python and you would type it in correctly unlike me and depending on different parts of the world you would either hit this off or you would hit this on okay and let's go down and here you would look for opportunities that you could actually do as a Python developer so check this out okay we have bunch of job opportunities here I'm on this live page hopefully everybody can view this I'll zoom in a little bit more now you're gonna look for opportunities you're gonna cancel out a lot of the things you can't do or maybe you don't have the skill set to do and that's fine maybe you look here DJI SDK Raspberry Pi I don't know how to do this I don't know what DJI is like a drone and working with Raspberry Pi I have no experience working with drones or Raspberry Pi so I'll skip this but now let's go down and I'll probably skip lunar and fertility calculator all right might be interesting to read it but I'm gonna skip that because you know also you have to be expert it's probably require some very specific knowledge maybe it's not a good fit let's keep going full sex off for engineers skip skip skip but now let's take a look at this one okay Python scrapey spider to retrieve PDF links we need three Python scrapy spiders to crawl three different domains and return the names and full URLs of all PDF files on the domain we do not need to download the PDFs only create a list of their names and full URLs must be written in Python alright so what is this person actually asking now it might sound like rocket science but all this person is asking is can you write a Python code that can go to all these web sites and literally pull all the URLs that say dot PDF at the end that's it so if you go to website and you see a URL on there that ends in dot html' don't write that one locally but only write a list of ones that end with dot PDF so all this person is asking is hey write a Python piece of code that can pull all the PDF URLs from the three different websites I give you so for example if I gave you clever programmer com your Python script should be able to go all over clever programmer comm and find all of the PDF links if I gave you Apple comm it should be able to go all through Apple comm and find all the PDF links that's it that's it for this job how much are they paying for this particular job they are paying three hundred dollars so let me zoom in just actually zoom out just a little bit right there you can see it's a three hundred dollar job you could actually apply for it right here right now all right and these people are legit look at where it says $30,000 right so you that's that's generally what you want to look at if you're looking to apply for a job you don't necessarily want to apply to just any job right like here it says your dollar spent payment unverified this person could just be lying or this person probably has no record of hiring people so we don't we don't have enough data but somebody who spent thirty thousand dollars paying other people to work with them they're most likely not playing around so if you're working with them you're gonna be at least making three hundred dollars or more for this particular task now if you're somebody who has cool social skills you could get this particular job and you could hand this job off to somebody who knows how to do it so you could hire a developer from somewhere and make sure that they do this project while you just manage them all right so then you can get profit but you don't even necessarily have to be that good at coding so that's an alternative even if you're not that great of a developer if you're a complete beginner but to be honest to do this project if you even have a little bit of skill in Python like let's say you're past the beginner phase or more intermediate like it says this is a project that you could do very realistically okay so that's one example let's go down and see maybe if there are any other examples that we can see right off the bat so okay let's see this one let me go to the chat first and see what's going on what are people saying in the chat how to use Python are we mark okay great awesome can I see your screen hello okay all right whatever so here I am on this page and you can see it says scrape two sites walk me through so now check this out okay this guy goes I know how to do basic scraping with Python and beautifulsoup I want you to show me how to do a couple of trickier sites or best of all show me how to access an API please note I am not paying you to do it for me so this guy's not even he doesn't even need you to do anything for him he just says I'm paying you to show me how to do it you can give me written instructions but I'd prefer a zoom meeting where we can walk through it together so he's even willing to not even meet with you in person or online or on a oneonone call he's even okay with the written instructions and he says these are not workrelated sites that are gathering information for my fantasy baseball team so he literally wants to hire someone to help him do some web scraping with Python and beautifulsoup for his freakin fantasy baseball team and he's verified here and he's paid people over he's paid a total of over $60 so unlike so it's not a scam it's somebody who's real who's spent real money and all he wants is somebody to walk him through so even if you're pretty much a beginner and you just go through a little bit of training with me on Python and beautifulsoup words or web scraping you can actually work with this person and land this person as your client and they'll be paying you 30 or 50 or $60 an hour so you work with this person for three or four hours that's two hundred three hundred dollars right there for you now before I continue further I do want to know if this is valuable for you is this been helpful so far I'm gonna stop my screen share for just a second all right cool hmm so all right now all this stuff that I'm sharing with you guys right over here we created our new program right around this whole thing because what we want to be able to do for you is I want you to be able to go to these exact jobs learn these exact skills and be able to land clients okay because most of the people they have skills but they have random freaking skills right but how cool would it be if somebody literally okay let me go back to that how cool would it be if somebody literally shows you like if I bring you in and I go we're gonna do this exact project this person is asking for then I'm gonna show you how to go to this exact client on upward exactly what to say to this person and then land this person as your client how cool would it be if somebody just went okay hey man you see this project right over here this Python scrapey spider one yeah I'm gonna show you exactly how to make it so we make it somewhere in a program we make this full project and then I show you exactly how to reach out to this client and how to land this client and then how to solve this problem for them that's essentially what I wanted to do in this new program that we have launched and it's called automate with Python like a badass and that program allows you to land freelancing jobs on platforms like upward comm start earning an income even if you're a complete beginner that is the goal but the new program that we just launched let's go through a few more examples okay so I have a few examples and I want also give you examples of what what not to do all right what type of jobs are bad for example so let's take a look at this job the guy says need help building restaurant app now somebody he needs his entry level that's pretty cool and he goes I'm developing an online application for my family's restaurant I'm an IT graduate certified in computer programming and I will be leading the project I'm interested in working with local developers bla bla bla bla bla bla bla I just kind of skipped over it and then he goes when I plan on meeting I would prefer that the developers are present because sometimes I'll be meeting with investors please send me a message your experience dah dah dah dah dah okay let me ask you a question if you're watching this stream drop it in the chat below right now is this a good job opportunity or is this a bad job opportunity this is a good freelancing opportunity or a bad freelancing opportunity and I want you to critically think and tell me why don't just look at my answer right over here at the top but like give me a reason as how you would reason with it and why I'm gonna jump into the chat now and see what you've come up with so tell me what you think about this our be within this is useful okay some people say no what seems says no Ola says lowrate vishal says no calm mel says good and bad both ELISA $0 spent Tanisha says no money spent okay this is really great thank you guys for participating okay I love that thank you so much Abdul Majeed says because your dollar spent this is not good because too many demands and no money spent thus far Eclair okay Siobhan says big nono money spent Akash says title and step description is not good small steps nope no build this out with PHP gonna be in the painintheass Christopher says Robert says $0 spent very vague description bad because too many texts and he seems not reliable no exact income he's fake okay looks like you guys are on the right track so that's fantastic guys by the way thank you for everybody who just spent that much time engaging with it you're much more likely to make way more money than a lot of the people who are on this livestream but not participating I still love you but these are the things that get you to actually understand a lot of these concepts this is what makes the difference between you getting these clients and not getting these clients and wash these clients be taken by somebody else so thank you for that level of initiative that level of participation because it also makes it a lot more fun for me so thank you for that okay so now I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna give you guys my thoughts on it would you guys like to hear my thoughts on this it's a trick question cuz share it anyway alright let's go so go right here okay so here's why I personally say no so first of all I agree with everyone this guy first of all has no ratings so there's zero stars that he has so that's the first flag for me another flag for me that's pretty huge is that he has spent $0 so far but now here's the big red flag for me he sounds like every loser who has an idea for an app and they're gonna be meeting with investors and they're trying to sell you some pipe dream of something that doesn't yet exist he doesn't have a prototype he hasn't built anything yet he says I plan to wrap it up and go native I plan to make this I'm thinking about making this maybe I'll be meeting with investors one day there's nothing yet there are no investors yet this person is an IT graduate certified in computer programming okay he doesn't even have a job so it doesn't mean that his idea doesn't have potential it doesn't mean that this might not be the next Facebook it just mean that the odds of all of that are very low and there's no security or any reliability all of us follow the data you have your life is very important guys your time is very important so going down a rabbit hole like this which a lot of freelancers do you will be so surprised so many freelancers will go down this path and there will be so confused and they didn't get any money this guy's not trying to scam you this is a person with good intentions but you are going to not make any money from this or very little money because this person has no money to give you he's a graduate he doesn't even have a job so we're he's gonna give you money from okay and investors and all that stuff is most likely a pipe dream if you get in any Ober car every bird driver you know what I'm talking about every bird driver has like a freaking app idea right you know like all those people everybody has right and all these people have no record for it for their results like why are you working a $7 an hour job but you have this amazing app idea like you should have you should have had something prior to that right like you should have had maybe a business prior to that you should have some kind of track record right then maybe your idea is more believable people want to get behind it so stay away from this is a trap this type of stuff okay again I'm not saying oh it's a scam or anything but I'm just saying that even though this person has good intentions you want to be really intelligent as a freelancer as a developer so then you that you could get paid what you're worth not be undermined and overworked okay so that is what I would say to that let me go and see what people are saying in the live chat because I want to make sure I engage with with you guys all right of course not zero income bla bla bla bla bla why not okay okay let's see okay what are people saying so no lurking yep yep all right so some people asked in the in some people email me from this livestream and they asked hey is this class so when you join this class guys you have access to when you join automate with Python the new program that we just launched you actually have access to it for a lifetime alright this is not you don't have access to for a little bit so even though it's a module program and we're only gonna add more modules to help you start earning an income because the whole point of the program is to take you from zero to start landing these specific clients I'm showing you an up work we want to make it that braindead simple for you and your return on investment when I make it that brain that simple but yeah so essentially once you join you're gonna have access to it for ever okay it's not like you just and you can take it at your own pace as well so I just wanted to mention that now let me continue and show you guys some other examples so let's go and do this let's go and do this let's go boom alright here's another good here's another job opportunity and you guys judge this and let me know what you guys think so this guy says Python beginner homework help needed hello this is an unconventional post from my company one of our customers need some help for high school homework in Python good English skill is a must can hire immediately so if it were you and let's say you are either a complete beginner or you have just a little bit of skill in Python or whatever the case may be would you take the time to apply to this or not Oh give me yes or no but also give me a critical thinking and your reason behind it okay I'm gonna read everybody's comment in the live stream and then we're gonna go from there so what do you think would you apply to this opportunity or not this was posted one day ago and yeah yep so let's see let's see what you guys say alright let's see what's going on Carla says let's do another example damn Carlos is excited how to write description how to write skill description up work will seem we also show you that in our program how do you write your skill description in up work alright so if those are the questions you want to ask that are very technical everything is covered in the course I would suggest you at least check it out okay alright let's see what's going on thanks for the info Robert says David Roberts and Snagit now ok Python and JavaScript worth more okay so somebody says Christopher says why not cool Mikey says yes seems good for a beginner Dino says you will do something like that for free cuz I can't pay that much no Camila is still suspicious comments all the suspicious gig look suspicious UNK it says knows your star and not challenging Carlos says yes he will do it because it says $600 spent and requires English okay say it says definitely yes came an 1230 says yes payment history is there Loco lightning says maybe only thing does not have much info Shawn says to be honest I won't because he's not specific about the problem Robert says any good reference is a worthwhile investment okay all right I do it if it's an up front or at least secured by third party Bruna says they have no rating that spent 600 I'd go for it okay cool Claire says I would apply alright so let's see here's how I would answer it there's no clear right or wrong answer sometimes there is but I'll just give you my thoughts behind it so you guys can see how I would kind of tackle thinking about this okay all right whoops okay so here's how I would kind of think about this Python beginner homework help needed now if I was in the or position where I was looking for a client and to work with someone and I want to just be able to live my own lifestyle right like I'm living in Hollywood I want to work remotely I want to be able to kind of have my own lifestyle choose my own hours have my own clients kind of earn an income and then choose my ability to hire and fire clients and I saw this now be like hmm skill level can't be that hard it's high school homework I have good English they're looking to hire immediately they are payment verified they have already spent over six hundred dollars for me depends on your interest right if this is genuinely not interesting to you then maybe don't do it I love working with people I love teaching I love explaining things it deepens my knowledge it also I love seeing the transformation that takes place in people and you change the trajectory of their entire life so for me that's what's really powerful and magnetic about this being able to have that opportunity and then privileged and outside of that I'm getting paid for this as well so it's a win on many different spectrums and now if I have another client who I like less I can fire that client or I can choose to up my rates with that client it gives me more options so you want to have your power comes from the number of options you have okay so this is you know if if you're talking about the dating world and if you guys have options of which girl you could hang out with or make her your girlfriend or your wife right you get to choose who you want to be with but if you don't have that option you will go with literally whoever is there available for you sometimes people get into a relationship and stay in that relationship for a long time out of convenience and out of having no options all right so you to always be the person who's in the position where you're choosing from a position of power rather than that of weakness then when you commit to a relationship then you really commit or if you commit to a client then you really commit so in this case I would say this would be a yes okay this is a great opportunity all right let's see what people have said before I continue any further let's go right there throw my face back on go here bada BAM bada boom let's see what people are saying all right paying well okay cool David is down for it say is genuine client Geetha's yes it is good for Python beginners Claire says yes I would also enjoy teaching explaining concept which eventually resonates with the student awesome Carlos says power choices comes from a mind set up of abundance exactly okay cool so all right cool okay hopefully I think hopefully for you guys this has been valuable so far this was something new that I wanted to do I'd never done this before I wanted to give it a try and see how you guys like it to be honest this is super if I was in that position this would have been massively valuable for me that's why I shared it because if I was back in the day where I was looking for clients and wanted to know how I could do it I would love to be able to just see exactly what I need to do okay so again if you guys are here and interested in all this stuff so far I'm gonna talk about how to automate with Python like a badass our brand new program that we just launched me and my entire team we worked on it and in that program we literally take these types of jobs from up work we complete them as projects that you can have on your portfolio and then we show you how you can go to these clients on up work how do you build a profile how do you go and reach out to these clients and how do you land these types of clients for these exact jobs so we don't want to just teach you random automation stuff that you can find on udemy.com or you can find on you know YouTube anywhere we want to give you the real stuff that you can actually apply in real life and actually get results and go to these practical jobs and get them done so we wanted to keep it as real world as practical as possible for you that's why I wanted to do this live stream and share with you everything live so you could see how this works okay this is why I believe it's so important to be just transparent and authentic with you guys in raw and instead of making some fancy video and sharing this with you guys I just wanted to share this with you one on one just me and you okay hopefully you found this valuable if you are interested in this definitely click the link in the description for the automate with Python like a badass course and at the very least just check it out we have an amazing video there for you to see you can also learn more about the program and see if it's a good fit for you if it's not you don't need to join it if it seems like a good fit for you you're interested in working as a remote developer kind of having your own lifestyle working as a freelancer and just becoming a badass at Python in general then definitely go check out this program we'll show you how to crush it as a Python freelancer in 2019 and beyond thank you guys so much for being here I love your face and as always I'm gonna see you in the next video
