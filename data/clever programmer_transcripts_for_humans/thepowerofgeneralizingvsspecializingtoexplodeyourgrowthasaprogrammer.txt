00:00 - hey you what is up how's it going this
00:02 - is Kazi from clever programmer calm in
00:05 - this video I want to talk about the
00:07 - power of generalizing versus
00:10 - specializing and how it can help you and
00:12 - it explode your growth as a computer
00:14 - programmer as a developer as a Python or
00:16 - JavaScript whatever programming language
00:19 - you're doing it's kind of free of that
00:20 - without any further ado let's jump right
00:23 - into it
00:24 - [Music]
00:33 - [Applause]
00:35 - okay welcome guys this is Kazi from
00:38 - clever programmer comm Here I am in
00:40 - Colombia marrying and traveling trying
00:42 - to get as much footage as possible here
00:44 - because it looks awesome but I do want
00:47 - to say that while I'm travelling here
00:49 - and exploring new things right like I
00:52 - moved to LA just go a bit like recently
00:54 - and now I'm in Colombia just like
00:56 - traveling
00:57 - it's like broadening my horizons at a
00:59 - whole new level and it's allowing me to
01:01 - think and tap into new ways of thinking
01:02 - that I never thought of and it's helping
01:04 - me explode and grow the business that's
01:06 - clever programmer like clever programmer
01:09 - is about to turn into something that's
01:10 - bigger than me or any one person you
01:13 - know it's all of us and it's a movement
01:16 - and I wouldn't be able to think like
01:17 - that if I just stayed pigeon-holed
01:19 - in one place at one time it doesn't let
01:21 - you operate at that higher level and so
01:24 - that's what traveling and exploring new
01:26 - things has done for me not Tommy and now
01:28 - tying it back to you right if you are
01:30 - learning let's say even programming you
01:32 - don't want to maybe even stick with one
01:34 - specific technology and become a
01:35 - specialist because like Robert Kiyosaki
01:37 - says in his book he says that
01:41 - specializing is for the I think he said
01:44 - something like for the bugs right and
01:46 - really the idea or insects I said
01:48 - something like that but basically idea
01:50 - is if you only specialize in one thing
01:53 - and kind of go
01:53 - laser focus in that you're not growing
01:56 - in all aspects of your life and you only
01:59 - have very linear growth okay it's very
02:01 - linear okay one for one when you look at
02:04 - and try new different days tap into
02:06 - possibilities you never explored before
02:08 - you have this explosive growth that's
02:10 - kind of what happened to clever
02:11 - programmer business like how it grew
02:13 - into this big thing in less than a year
02:16 - right that doesn't happen for many of
02:18 - those are coding channels and it's not
02:19 - because of me it's because I'm
02:21 - constantly changing my surroundings
02:23 - constantly changing the people that I'm
02:25 - around and the thoughts that I'm letting
02:26 - it because as long as you remember the
02:28 - thoughts you're letting in are not your
02:29 - own and they can be changed as a very
02:32 - powerful and freeing thing and you could
02:34 - use it to your advantage okay so if you
02:36 - want to become a better programmer
02:37 - why don't you travel go to New York
02:39 - places and just meet people there and
02:41 - maybe they can teach you some new ways
02:42 - of program
02:43 - right it just opens up the way that you
02:45 - think and explore and look for
02:47 - opportunities you might not have been
02:49 - looking in the places before you know
02:50 - also it lets you go of the fear of
02:52 - what's new what's next then you can
02:54 - apply the same thing to programming the
02:56 - same reason why people get so afraid of
02:57 - applying to this job or that job because
03:00 - we're afraid we don't know what's there
03:01 - and we don't know if we're gonna get
03:03 - accepted we don't know there's a lot of
03:05 - unknown variables so when you do new
03:07 - things all the time you become less
03:10 - fazed by the unknown you actually start
03:12 - enjoying the unknown okay and that's how
03:15 - I want you to look at your life as a
03:16 - programmer as a web developer as a
03:19 - businessman whatever it is that you're
03:21 - doing okay and if you can do that you
03:24 - will tap and you will grow at an
03:26 - exponential level and that's what I want
03:28 - you to be doing in whatever area of your
03:30 - life you're in do that you will explode
03:33 - you will grow a lot other cool things
03:35 - right like I'm here and you could hire a
03:38 - private instructor to coach your
03:39 - programming in United States that might
03:42 - have been like I don't know 100 hundred
03:44 - $50 an hour you could come to another
03:46 - country like Colombia I'm 18 and you
03:48 - could have programmers train you for
03:51 - like $10 an hour or $15 an hour and
03:54 - they're badass programmers so just
03:57 - different way of thinking and kind of
03:59 - think of value arbitrage as well right
04:01 - take advantage of all these
04:03 - opportunities that we have in this world
04:05 - you're not supposed to you know most
04:06 - people 80% of the people die within 300
04:09 - hour radius of 300 miles from Woodman
04:11 - where they're born you don't want to be
04:13 - part of that statistic ok squad Explorer
04:15 - have fun and as always this is Kazi I
04:18 - love your faces off and I'll see you in
04:20 - the next video
04:21 - [Music]

hey you what is up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm in this video I want to talk about the power of generalizing versus specializing and how it can help you and it explode your growth as a computer programmer as a developer as a Python or JavaScript whatever programming language you're doing it's kind of free of that without any further ado let's jump right into it okay welcome guys this is Kazi from clever programmer comm Here I am in Colombia marrying and traveling trying to get as much footage as possible here because it looks awesome but I do want to say that while I'm travelling here and exploring new things right like I moved to LA just go a bit like recently and now I'm in Colombia just like traveling it's like broadening my horizons at a whole new level and it's allowing me to think and tap into new ways of thinking that I never thought of and it's helping me explode and grow the business that's clever programmer like clever programmer is about to turn into something that's bigger than me or any one person you know it's all of us and it's a movement and I wouldn't be able to think like that if I just stayed pigeonholed in one place at one time it doesn't let you operate at that higher level and so that's what traveling and exploring new things has done for me not Tommy and now tying it back to you right if you are learning let's say even programming you don't want to maybe even stick with one specific technology and become a specialist because like Robert Kiyosaki says in his book he says that specializing is for the I think he said something like for the bugs right and really the idea or insects I said something like that but basically idea is if you only specialize in one thing and kind of go laser focus in that you're not growing in all aspects of your life and you only have very linear growth okay it's very linear okay one for one when you look at and try new different days tap into possibilities you never explored before you have this explosive growth that's kind of what happened to clever programmer business like how it grew into this big thing in less than a year right that doesn't happen for many of those are coding channels and it's not because of me it's because I'm constantly changing my surroundings constantly changing the people that I'm around and the thoughts that I'm letting it because as long as you remember the thoughts you're letting in are not your own and they can be changed as a very powerful and freeing thing and you could use it to your advantage okay so if you want to become a better programmer why don't you travel go to New York places and just meet people there and maybe they can teach you some new ways of program right it just opens up the way that you think and explore and look for opportunities you might not have been looking in the places before you know also it lets you go of the fear of what's new what's next then you can apply the same thing to programming the same reason why people get so afraid of applying to this job or that job because we're afraid we don't know what's there and we don't know if we're gonna get accepted we don't know there's a lot of unknown variables so when you do new things all the time you become less fazed by the unknown you actually start enjoying the unknown okay and that's how I want you to look at your life as a programmer as a web developer as a businessman whatever it is that you're doing okay and if you can do that you will tap and you will grow at an exponential level and that's what I want you to be doing in whatever area of your life you're in do that you will explode you will grow a lot other cool things right like I'm here and you could hire a private instructor to coach your programming in United States that might have been like I don't know 100 hundred $50 an hour you could come to another country like Colombia I'm 18 and you could have programmers train you for like $10 an hour or $15 an hour and they're badass programmers so just different way of thinking and kind of think of value arbitrage as well right take advantage of all these opportunities that we have in this world you're not supposed to you know most people 80% of the people die within 300 hour radius of 300 miles from Woodman where they're born you don't want to be part of that statistic ok squad Explorer have fun and as always this is Kazi I love your faces off and I'll see you in the next video
