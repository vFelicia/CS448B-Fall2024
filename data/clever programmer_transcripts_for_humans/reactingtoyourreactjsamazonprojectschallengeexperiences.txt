04:51 - what's up guys my name is chris i
04:54 - started coding just a few months ago
04:55 - when i was furloughed
04:57 - um i jumped into the five day react
05:00 - challenge
05:00 - to try and push myself uh definitely
05:03 - glad that i did i was really really
05:04 - nervous about it due to my skill level
05:07 - but um i'm happy that i took that leap
05:09 - of faith hey
05:10 - um as far as the future is concerned i'm
05:13 - just going to continue to grow
05:15 - continue to learn and uh hopefully

05:21 - want to say thank you
05:22 - and uh see you along the road see you
05:24 - guys nice i love
05:27 - when all of this stuff starts becoming
05:29 - like a
05:31 - real thing for everybody and it starts
05:33 - turning it into reality
05:35 - so it always hypes me up uh let's see
05:37 - who else we got
05:39 - is that jason her hey jason
05:43 - what's up guys uh my name's jason jason
05:45 - your voice is
05:46 - crisp and my experience with coding is
05:49 - probably about like four months
05:50 - in nice new coder i took a coding
05:53 - bootcamp
05:54 - and it was pretty good you know i
05:56 - learned a lot of my foundational things
05:58 - i made about three projects with full
06:00 - crud functionality i just don't feel
06:02 - like they look
06:03 - good or like real world applications so
06:06 - uh it's been pretty tough with the job
06:07 - hunt
06:08 - and i think um i joined this clever
06:11 - programming because
06:12 - i wanted to get like real world
06:14 - applications hey
06:15 - you know where to go for that let's go
06:20 - yeah to the react.js challenge and i
06:22 - looked through your channel and i was
06:23 - like totally amazed and i'm going to
06:24 - like
06:25 - binge through everything now and just
06:26 - like go through all of those videos
06:28 - um i love all those clone ideas and i
06:31 - think the biggest achievement for me was
06:33 - like
06:33 - totally grasping all these ideas i know
06:35 - a lot of time you guys were saying
06:37 - pattern recognition but beyond that like
06:40 - i actually
06:40 - really like your basic and like simple
06:42 - breakdowns of these concepts because to
06:44 - me like
06:45 - it made so much more sense than what i
06:47 - learned in my coding bootcamp to be
06:48 - honest
06:49 - um you guys explain it so so well um
06:54 - i think these real real world
06:56 - applications are really going to boost
06:57 - up my
06:58 - resume and portfolio so i'm looking
07:00 - forward to that and just actually just
07:02 - keeping in touch with this community and
07:03 - channel i think it's like one of the
07:04 - best things i've found so far

08:12 - coronavirus hit so
08:14 - i'm looking for a new opportunity so i
08:16 - decided to take up coding because
08:19 - it's creative and i've always been
08:21 - creative and so i love that about coding
08:23 - and i have a lot of fun with that part
08:24 - of it
08:25 - so um my experience in coding up until
08:27 - about two months ago was virtually
08:29 - nothing that's crazy bro from 11 year
08:32 - bartender
08:33 - and an actor to a coder that is sick
08:36 - but all those acting skills and social
08:38 - skills are paying off now
08:40 - because look at how good this looks bro
08:42 - so i hopped on a couple classes got my
08:44 - html and my css
08:46 - skills partly savvy um and i joined the
08:50 - uh
08:50 - cp five day challenge because i wanted
08:54 - to learn from the best and i've
08:55 - uh i'm a big believer and if you want to
08:57 - learn something and do it right you just
08:58 - got to throw yourself to the
09:00 - wolves
09:00 - learn it the hard way so that's what i'm
09:02 - doing um and
