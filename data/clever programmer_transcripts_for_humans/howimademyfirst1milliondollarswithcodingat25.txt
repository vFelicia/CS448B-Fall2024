00:00 - hey guys what's up how's it going this
00:02 - is Kazi from clever programmer calm and
00:05 - this video is gonna be a little bit
00:07 - different than a lot of the videos that
00:09 - I make and this video it's not going to
00:12 - be flashy there's gonna not be that many
00:15 - edits and I am just gonna document and
00:19 - talk about my journey to my first
00:22 - $1,000,000 in the last two and a half
00:25 - years and because this video will be
00:29 - more for developers because this is the
00:32 - developer channel clever programmer I am
00:35 - gonna talk about things that can
00:36 - potentially help you and maybe it can
00:39 - help you on your journey or you can have
00:41 - a similar pattern but really this video
00:43 - is just for the older me so if there's
00:45 - an older me out there who has the same
00:47 - type of dreams the same type of
00:49 - ambitions my goal is just to kind of
00:52 - make this a message for him or her so I
00:55 - hope you enjoy it I've put together
00:58 - incredible training for you to help you
01:00 - become a six-figure developer so you can
01:02 - earn the income you want you can have
01:04 - the time money and the freedom and the
01:05 - impact that you want to have in this
01:07 - world the link is below click on the
01:09 - link it'll take you to the training just
01:11 - put in your email I'll send you this
01:13 - masterclass
01:14 - it's three-part series it'll absolutely
01:15 - blow your mind completely free go there
01:19 - do it now and I'll see you on the other
01:21 - side kind of get into this video and
01:24 - there are a few important concepts that
01:26 - I'm gonna be talking about along this
01:28 - I'm probably gonna be talking about the
01:30 - concept of like hime arbitrage I'm gonna
01:34 - be talking about like value versus money
01:37 - and skills and probably many other
01:40 - things more the big thing is I'm gonna
01:44 - really free flow this and yeah I just
01:46 - talk through kind of like I'm talking
01:48 - with other person so let's just kind of
01:50 - get started 2014 is when I actually
01:53 - started coding so I'm gonna put that as
01:56 - started these are the years 2017 through
02:00 - 2019 where I generated a million plus
02:04 - dollars my first one
02:06 - and I've documented this entire series
02:09 - that I'll put out at some point on my
02:11 - personal brand this is that but this
02:13 - part of it starting from 2014 was
02:16 - pivotal because if this didn't happen
02:18 - and this wouldn't have happened in this
02:21 - year from coding I didn't really earn an
02:24 - income 2014 mostly I didn't earn that
02:26 - much income I just learned how to code I
02:29 - did know principles of freelancing
02:32 - because I was an instructor like a chess
02:36 - instructor and then I would go and teach
02:38 - people how to play chess and then I
02:41 - would charge for that and so people were
02:43 - paying me you know anywhere from $35 an
02:46 - hour at $150 an hour to teach them
02:48 - chests I'm about 2,000 USCF rated as a
02:52 - chess player but so it basically means
02:54 - like I'm a good chess player not the
02:55 - best chess player because the best
02:56 - players are around 2,500 2,600 but I
02:59 - developed a skill of freelancing in my
03:02 - earlier years so for me that was really
03:04 - really important so you know freelancing
03:07 - I'll write that here that was a really
03:10 - important skill that I actually started
03:12 - developing way before 2014 I was
03:15 - developing the skill of freelancing from
03:18 - really 2011 to 2014 so I had lots of
03:23 - experience freelancing I never did a
03:25 - full time job a single time in my life I
03:27 - actually instead just did chess and
03:31 - taught chess as an instructor and I've
03:34 - worked as an independent contractor
03:36 - forever
03:36 - so whether it was I was doing one-on-one
03:38 - lessons or I was teaching a classroom
03:39 - full of kids it was always as a
03:42 - freelancer independent contractor okay
03:45 - so I started coding here 2015 was I'll
03:50 - just map out the years so for example
03:52 - 2015 I made roughly 80k 80k so that's
03:57 - $80,000 in one year 2015-2016 I made one
04:03 - hundred and four thousand and something
04:05 - changed 2016 from coding but I will just
04:09 - round I'll just say 100k and then I
04:13 - started my business of clever programmer
04:15 - at the end of 2016 and 2017 to 2019
04:19 - currently my focus is just clever
04:21 - programmer and nothing else so um my
04:24 - goal is to just help developers now
04:26 - primarily I don't do any freelancing I
04:28 - don't teach coding anymore I don't have
04:32 - time for any of that I just have time to
04:35 - dedicate to this business to help people
04:37 - become developers so after 2015-2016 I
04:40 - basically realized hey like it's cool
04:43 - that I'm making 100k it's really awesome
04:45 - but even if I worked harder and became
04:48 - more incredible I would maybe get the
04:50 - 200k a year after many many years and
04:52 - then I would get to like 300k and that
04:54 - kind of would be the extent of that
04:55 - maybe math and I realized okay I could
04:58 - actually make a lot more income if I
05:01 - started a business and helped other
05:03 - people because it just makes sense for
05:06 - example by myself I can only change the
05:08 - life of myself and that's one person but
05:11 - through the scale of the internet I
05:12 - could potentially change the lives or
05:14 - helped tens of thousands or hundreds of
05:17 - thousands of people on their journey so
05:19 - if I could help hundreds of thousands of
05:21 - people on their journey well then that
05:23 - means that my income would likely
05:26 - increase more than a hundred thousand
05:28 - dollars a year and because I'm also
05:30 - helping other people increase their
05:31 - income so it's beneficial for everybody
05:35 - the impact is much bigger so the income
05:37 - is much bigger 2017 was my first year in
05:40 - business and I did 211 K 2018 was I
05:47 - think somewhere like 350 K and then 2019
05:51 - we're already at 350 K and it's
05:54 - September so we have a few more months
05:56 - to go
05:57 - so we're projected to probably do maybe
05:59 - 400 or something like that you know
06:01 - projection so I'll just say like 400 K
06:05 - and I'll leave it at that so if you map
06:08 - out this these are the two and a half
06:11 - years more than 1 million was generated
06:16 - with then I don't know if you can see
06:19 - this or not very clearly but I'm just
06:21 - I'm trying my best here but yeah more
06:24 - like about 1 million dollars for general
06:25 - was generator this period
06:28 - sure you can add this too so all of this
06:32 - is from coding yeah now I'm pretty much
06:34 - gonna just talk about like what I did
06:37 - every year 2014 for me was all about
06:40 - just increasing my skill set like in
06:43 - coding that was it so 2014 i remember
06:46 - that i 2014 i actually got started 2014
06:50 - or right around i believe august august
06:53 - 10th was the day i committed to coding
06:57 - that was the day I started with my best
07:00 - friend Tenzin and Tenzin and I just
07:03 - started coding right around that time I
07:05 - think he I convinced him his channels
07:07 - called what's dev and I convinced him to
07:11 - quit his job at CVS like a month later
07:15 - and then he started coding with me so
07:18 - then we were both doing it at the same
07:21 - time I don't I owe a lot to him because
07:24 - I don't think I would have continued
07:26 - coding if I didn't have another person
07:28 - there with me so it was awesome and we
07:31 - just kind of went hard at it
07:33 - so this Tenzin I just learning coding
07:36 - for about like 15 to 18 hours a day so
07:39 - let's see here about let's just average
07:43 - it out to 16 hours per day coding now
07:51 - there were a lot of things that I
07:52 - wouldn't recommend a person does such as
07:55 - like really eating unhealthy foods and
07:59 - you know not really taking the best care
08:01 - of yourself having Monster energy drinks
08:04 - all the time
08:05 - malnutrition lack of sleep so that's not
08:09 - good like you'd probably want to avoid
08:12 - all of those things but you know we we
08:14 - didn't we just all we did was code so we
08:17 - wanted to get that skill set like I
08:19 - understood how important it was to get
08:22 - this skill set it was more important
08:24 - than anything I knew that's money
08:26 - followed value and I started to
08:29 - understand this concept around like 2014
08:31 - ish I started reading audible I listened
08:34 - to Johnson misses book that was really
08:35 - really valuable for me so I'll point out
08:38 - the key things for me in my earlier well
08:41 - actually I don't think I read that to
08:43 - later when I started coding I yeah I
08:45 - didn't even know who Johnson was was
08:46 - actually I I found out about him later
08:49 - so I'm not gonna write about that right
08:50 - this second will come later
08:52 - so 2014 it was about 16 hours of coding
08:54 - I went to a place called ps1 in Chicago
08:58 - and that's where I would code it was a
08:59 - co-working space and I along with Tenzin
09:02 - would code I actually we started in the
09:04 - basement of my house and in the basement
09:06 - of my house we would code every day
09:08 - every single day and I would code every
09:11 - single day and I remember I learned
09:13 - about you know command line and got
09:15 - really good at it command line is a
09:18 - really amazing skill to have that just a
09:22 - lot of developers try to avoid and then
09:25 - they get screwed over later so they
09:27 - tried to use everything with the GUI
09:28 - they'll try to learn like get from the
09:31 - GUI and they'll learn all these things
09:33 - for like everything that are like
09:34 - opening up desktops and putting things
09:36 - into it you know their mouse and what
09:39 - ends up happening is that they lack the
09:42 - skill of command line and then it comes
09:44 - to bite you in their house a lot later
09:45 - so you probably want to avoid you want
09:49 - to avoid that you want to work on the
09:53 - skills that really really will help you
09:56 - and these types of skills like command
09:58 - line there's no such thing as instant
09:59 - gratification it's brutal it's painful
10:02 - it's not fun it's not fun to look at
10:04 - there's just no satisfaction you get out
10:06 - of it besides just feeling like an
10:08 - elitist that's the only satisfaction
10:09 - that I got out of it when I was doing I
10:11 - just felt like an elitist and I thought
10:13 - wow this makes me really [ __ ] cool
10:14 - and probably nobody else is doing it so
10:17 - yeah I'm just gonna keep doing it
10:19 - command line was a pretty important
10:21 - skill I learned I learned obviously the
10:25 - Python skills so all I did was Python I
10:28 - was taking courses on Coursera Udacity
10:32 - team treehouse headaches cs50 I mean I
10:37 - was just taking all of the courses that
10:38 - you could imagine and then I was just
10:40 - completing a lot of them back to back to
10:43 - back to back the courses that helped me
10:45 - the most was Coursera
10:49 - had intro interactive intro and
10:52 - interactive programming with Python
10:54 - something like III PP intro to
10:56 - interactive programming with Python yeah
10:58 - so I IPP there was a course by Coursera
11:01 - I pp 1 then there was part 2 and then
11:07 - there was principles of computing part 1
11:10 - and then there was principles of
11:11 - computing part 2 so these were this was
11:14 - intermediate this was more beginner but
11:16 - I mean it gets pretty advanced you're
11:19 - building a lot of different things so it
11:21 - was an it was honestly like my curiosity
11:23 - for coding my love for it how
11:25 - fascinating I found the concepts I mean
11:28 - it was really really intriguing to me
11:30 - you know learning about the by nor what
11:32 - is it binomial theorem I don't do a lot
11:35 - with it anymore but when I learned about
11:37 - it blew my mind I just found it
11:40 - fascinating so I kept I just kept doing
11:43 - more and more of it and picked up this
11:46 - skill set of code like problem solving
11:48 - really well because I was just spending
11:50 - a lot of time around it I learned
11:51 - recursion the other important things
11:53 - that I learned because I ended up
11:55 - picking up the command-line I learned
11:56 - get versus get hub fairly quickly so
12:02 - that was another really important skill
12:04 - for me to have under my belt it played
12:06 - out in my favor hugely because this is
12:09 - where recruiters are looking and most
12:11 - people don't think about that skill for
12:13 - a really long time and I just start
12:15 - working on it pretty much right away
12:17 - some tips I will give you from my
12:20 - learnings were that when I was coding
12:22 - the thing that helped me really improve
12:24 - my skill set was I didn't just follow
12:27 - the tutorials I would go off and I would
12:30 - do my own thing for example if the
12:32 - tutorial was tic-tac-toe or
12:35 - rock-paper-scissors or something I would
12:37 - follow it to a certain extent and then I
12:40 - would turn it into a completely
12:41 - different game I would take it from rock
12:43 - paper scissors to turned into rock
12:45 - scissors papers lizard-spock or I would
12:49 - take that same rock paper scissors that
12:51 - I was taught how to made on Python and
12:53 - then try to host it online so there were
12:56 - a lot of different things that I would
12:57 - try to do
12:58 - and that really really helped 2014 I
13:02 - didn't spend any time learning web
13:03 - development I didn't spend any time
13:05 - learning like I think it's also really
13:07 - important to talk about what I didn't do
13:08 - because people try to do too much my
13:11 - friend Tenzin the problem that kept
13:13 - happening with him for a while before
13:15 - this was that he had known about coding
13:20 - way before I ever did so he knew about
13:23 - coding when he was like 10 or 11 years
13:26 - old and he was making websites in HTML
13:28 - and CSS and all this and I actually
13:30 - found out more about coding in the start
13:31 - from him then he did for me because he
13:34 - knew more about it in the start and when
13:36 - he was 11 12 13 like he would keep
13:39 - building a website for following
13:40 - tutorials on team tree house things like
13:42 - that but then as time progressed he
13:44 - would go through the tutorial and not do
13:46 - anything else and then come back didn't
13:48 - go through the tutorial then come back
13:50 - then go through a tutorial then come
13:51 - back he would have a lot of time in
13:52 - between the time he would take off from
13:54 - coding so it was almost like he would
13:56 - work really hard to build this wall and
13:58 - then he would leave and during a bad
14:01 - season or war or whatever the wall would
14:05 - break down and then he would be like
14:06 - damn and then he would come back after
14:07 - months to build up the wall that's all
14:10 - that kept happening and that's what's
14:12 - known as tutorial purgatory and a lot of
14:14 - people fall victim to that and they
14:17 - allow tutorial purgatory to really
14:19 - control
14:20 - major aspects of their lives and affect
14:23 - them in horrible horrible ways but the
14:26 - one thing that was good that I was doing
14:29 - was I just never picked my head up like
14:32 - I just kept my head down and I just kept
14:34 - going so it was a Python and I just
14:37 - didn't do anything else so I didn't do
14:40 - HTML all right I didn't do CSS I didn't
14:45 - do JavaScript I didn't do Java
14:47 - I didn't just keep doing tutorial after
14:50 - tutorial and then just keep starting
14:53 - from scratch I just kept moving forward
14:56 - so I just stuck to one thing it doesn't
14:59 - matter you can pick Python you can pick
15:00 - job you can pick JavaScript it really
15:02 - doesn't matter just pick one thing and
15:05 - then just do it and then just don't stop
15:07 - forever that's how you get good because
15:10 - getting good
15:10 - is a very weird if there was a curve for
15:14 - getting good and you had like it's kind
15:17 - of a really shitty feeling cuz if you
15:19 - started you don't just let me make it
15:21 - with the different moniker so you can
15:23 - see if the line looks like
15:24 - but getting good is a really weird curve
15:26 - kind of looks like this whatever are you
15:28 - doing just doesn't make any difference
15:30 - at all so it just keeps going straight
15:32 - straight straight straight straight
15:34 - straight and then it starts to build on
15:36 - top of itself on top of itself on top of
15:38 - stuff and then you just start getting
15:40 - exponentially better and better better
15:42 - every single day and then you start to
15:45 - plateau and and then you have very small
15:49 - increase forever this is the area that
15:54 - people just give up on so people will
15:57 - quit here in their coding journey
15:59 - they'll quit here they'll quit here
16:01 - they'll quit here they'll quit here hell
16:03 - they might even quit here but then when
16:06 - you're on this curve and you get path
16:08 - and you pass it you're never coming back
16:10 - you're so high up on this hill you can't
16:14 - even see down here so you don't even
16:16 - remember what it feels like to be in
16:18 - tutorial purgatory or whatever and so
16:20 - what happens to most people is they'll
16:22 - start programming and they'll quit start
16:24 - quite start quit start quit start quit
16:26 - quit after tutorials and whatever and
16:28 - that's why they're always tough here and
16:30 - they keep changing things they're like
16:32 - I'm gonna learn web development then
16:34 - they're like I'm gonna learn this
16:35 - language then they're like what other is
16:36 - the top four programming languages
16:38 - okay I'll learn this you have to
16:40 - understand that when I started learning
16:42 - Python it wasn't popular it wasn't that
16:44 - popular now it's the number one
16:46 - programming language in the world it
16:47 - destroys everything it shifts on
16:49 - JavaScript Java anything right it's
16:54 - simple just look at the Pipal index pop
16:58 - popularity of a programming language
16:59 - look at Google Trends and it just
17:02 - dominates here's another simple test go
17:03 - to YouTube just type in Python and look
17:05 - at the top videos and the views they'll
17:07 - be like 8 million 10 million look at
17:09 - JavaScript it'll be like 1 million look
17:11 - at Java be like less than 1 million or
17:14 - million so certain things are really
17:16 - basic to understand and that's how
17:19 - you'll understand like what thing is
17:21 - popular and what not but when I started
17:23 - it wasn't the most pop
17:24 - other languages or were much more
17:26 - popular and I just I actually picked it
17:30 - because I felt like nobody would know
17:31 - about it I never heard the name Python I
17:33 - heard people talk about Java I heard
17:35 - people talk about JavaScript and all
17:37 - this other crap but I never heard
17:39 - anybody talk about Python so I thought
17:41 - that's why I should pick it because I am
17:43 - a contrarian and I love doing the things
17:45 - other people aren't doing because
17:46 - contradiction is where the geniuses
17:49 - contradiction is where Einstein lived
17:51 - and contradiction is where Warren
17:53 - Buffett live and contradiction is where
17:56 - Steve Jobs lived and contradiction is
17:59 - just where the geniuses so you wanna you
18:02 - go with average you'll get average
18:03 - results and so don't go with average
18:06 - anyways so it was really important what
18:09 - I didn't do that I think is really
18:11 - important to highlight and it just kept
18:12 - making consistent progress so like I
18:15 - went from projects projects than more
18:18 - advanced classes more advanced classes
18:20 - and then I just taught myself almost all
18:22 - of the coding and then I did a lot of it
18:24 - on my own by doing my own projects and
18:26 - things like that that was about 2014
18:29 - honestly there was also a lot of 2015
18:31 - what I did because I just understood how
18:33 - important the skillset was and the reach
18:36 - and then I just went all in because if I
18:39 - pick up the skill then I knew I knew
18:41 - money followed value and so if I picked
18:45 - up the skill then I just knew that money
18:47 - would come along with it at some point
18:49 - because that's just how many works money
18:51 - is not this weird static thing that most
18:55 - people think about and take in and just
18:57 - sit on it with their ass and they hold
18:59 - it close to their chest and they're
19:00 - scared to spend it on learning new
19:02 - things but they're very okay with
19:04 - spending it on things that give them
19:06 - instant gratification so most people
19:09 - will you know nobody thinks buying a
19:12 - laptop or TVs a scam because instant
19:15 - gratification right you buy it and you
19:17 - have it but most people have a lot of
19:19 - trouble spending money for education or
19:21 - training or whatever gives them benefits
19:25 - in the long term because well that's a
19:28 - scam because you're not getting anything
19:29 - immediately and when people don't get
19:32 - anything immediately their little brains
19:34 - get very hurt and they feel weird about
19:39 - it right so what I was doing in a lot of
19:42 - the 2014 2015 was I learned that okay if
19:47 - I'm making money from chess and say I
19:49 - was making thirty five to fifty dollars
19:51 - an hour and if coding was a higher
19:53 - paying skill set than chess so if I
19:56 - understood that coding is gonna be
19:59 - greater than chess like money-wise right
20:02 - dollar wise and opportunity wise and
20:04 - things like that the need for it I mean
20:06 - chess is a hobby coding is something
20:08 - that the world depends on there's a big
20:10 - difference well then I thought okay how
20:13 - many times is it better and I would say
20:16 - that it's almost five to ten times
20:18 - better the opportunity for coding well
20:21 - if the opportunity is five to ten times
20:22 - better than if I'm making a hundred and
20:26 - fifty dollars or let's 9150 let's just
20:29 - say if I was making $50 for a chess
20:33 - coaching session for an hour of my time
20:36 - well that $50 in the coding world is
20:40 - worth a lot more in the long run it's
20:43 - either worth it's worth somewhere like
20:44 - three hundred five hundred dollars and
20:46 - the reason I say that is because there's
20:48 - no chess job you can do full-time
20:49 - there's no chess job you can do 20 hours
20:51 - a week but there coding jobs you can do
20:53 - twenty forty hours a week so even even
20:55 - though it doesn't mean that I'll be
20:57 - making $500 an hour from coding it just
21:00 - does mean that over the course of a week
21:02 - I would make a lot more income and I
21:04 - would help a lot more more people from
21:06 - coding than I would a chess right so
21:09 - then I learned so then I thought okay
21:11 - these fifty dollars are actually either
21:14 - less than or equal to coding like five
21:17 - hundred dollars okay so one time so once
21:21 - I made this conclusion I thought okay
21:23 - well all I need to do is trade my chess
21:28 - skill for coding skill that's really it
21:32 - so if I could trade my chess skill for
21:34 - coding skill then I would go really
21:36 - really far and I thought okay what's the
21:38 - best way to do that so obviously
21:40 - therefore
21:40 - courses and that's helpful but I mean
21:43 - think about any Olympic athlete right
21:45 - that you know of the best in the world
21:47 - none of them became the best in the
21:49 - world by taking courses and learning by
21:52 - themselves most of them became Olympic
21:55 - level athletes could they have coaching
21:57 - every day the best students that you can
22:00 - think about in you know who are killing
22:02 - it in all their exams in everything they
22:04 - have tutoring every day so I understood
22:07 - that I would need mentoring and I
22:09 - understood that I would need it pretty
22:12 - consistently so I thought okay well what
22:15 - I can do is I can pay let me clean up
22:18 - some part of the board it's not ok what
22:22 - I can actually do is I can I can pay a
22:25 - coding mentor 50 dollars an hour and
22:30 - learn coding so any money that I was
22:33 - actually making from my chess I thought
22:35 - well I could just reinvest it into
22:38 - coding the arbitrage is huge because I'm
22:43 - spending $50 that's almost equal to five
22:46 - hundred dollars in the long run because
22:49 - I'm trading my chess skill set for the
22:52 - coding skill set so I'm paying 50 I'm
22:55 - learning from somebody who has ten years
22:57 - of experience in the software
22:59 - development world because I would go to
23:01 - a platform like code mentor dot IO or
23:02 - something like that and this video is
23:04 - not sponsored by them or whatever and I
23:06 - would just pay a mentor so it's not okay
23:09 - if I paid a mentor $50 an hour from my
23:12 - chess and I learned coding is
23:14 - essentially like I'll just training
23:15 - chess for coding for almost an equal
23:18 - price except I know that the value for
23:22 - coding and the opportunity for coding is
23:23 - ten times more so I'm just trading in
23:25 - one skill set for another right you
23:28 - could do the same thing for example if
23:30 - you're driving an uber right now or you
23:32 - drive a truck right now or you are doing
23:35 - IT desk job well think about it right if
23:39 - you're doing an IT job maybe you're
23:41 - making $15 an hour and pretty soon
23:43 - you're gonna be replaced because it's a
23:45 - mindless job and so you're not you're
23:49 - not bringing that much value to the
23:50 - world so AI is gonna replace you and
23:53 - then
23:54 - you're gonna be making $0 so think about
23:56 - how much coding like how much
23:59 - opportunity there is for coding versus
24:01 - uber so let's just say you drive an uber
24:02 - right so you let's say that there's
24:04 - coding on this hand and I'm gonna make
24:07 - the claim that coding opportunities more
24:09 - than uber driving opportunity because
24:11 - they're already coming out with
24:12 - self-driving cars five years ten years
24:14 - from now they're gonna be non drivers
24:15 - okay but most people like want instant
24:18 - gratification that's another thing I
24:20 - want to talk about now if you're driving
24:23 - an uber and you want to become a
24:24 - developer that's a pretty stupid thing
24:27 - to do because think about it this is a
24:30 - $10 an hour skill set so $10 an hour
24:33 - skill set let's say you're driving
24:35 - people around doesn't require any skill
24:37 - you and almost anybody can drive as long
24:39 - as you have arms and legs you can drive
24:42 - you know versus coding I would argue
24:45 - like how many times more opportunity is
24:48 - there don't think in terms of don't even
24:50 - think in terms of dollars think in terms
24:52 - of how much more opportunity there is
24:54 - for coding right so let's say if this is
24:58 - like opportunity and let's just say this
25:00 - is a one-in opportunity how many times
25:02 - more is the opportunity for coding
25:05 - especially as we head into the future
25:06 - versus uber I would argue that it's
25:09 - probably fifty to a hundred times more
25:13 - opportunity and when I say opportunity I
25:15 - mean like not just how many available
25:16 - jobs there are because there are a lot
25:19 - of probably a lot of jobs available for
25:20 - uber everybody can get one job from uber
25:23 - but what I mean is that one how much
25:25 - income then to the how long you will be
25:29 - satisfied doing this versus uber I mean
25:31 - I will shoot myself if I did over for
25:34 - like a week now imagine doing it for
25:37 - years right that gets very crazy very
25:39 - quickly so there is less satisfaction
25:42 - but then outside of that you're not
25:44 - increasing your income and what other
25:46 - things is they gonna help you in life
25:48 - it's not gonna help you in business
25:50 - later it's not gonna help you if you
25:52 - want to get a really big promotion it's
25:54 - not gonna help you form to become a
25:55 - manager at some company it's not gonna
25:57 - help you with creating some kind of
25:58 - startup it's not gonna help you
26:00 - building passive income it just fits in
26:04 - with no goal
26:05 - whereas coding can fit in later
26:07 - with you wanting to start a business it
26:10 - fits in with you doing something even
26:12 - completely different from coding and
26:13 - then the opportunity for coding and
26:16 - developers is growing as well because
26:18 - all artificial intelligence and all of
26:19 - that will require people to program it
26:21 - and then maybe we can argue that a
26:23 - hundred years from now it wouldn't need
26:25 - developers but you know I'm fine with a
26:27 - hundred years because then I'll be dead
26:29 - and then it doesn't matter anymore so I
26:32 - would say that the opportunity for
26:34 - coding is a hundred times more why is
26:36 - somebody spending time here that's a big
26:38 - mistake big mistake people make and
26:42 - that's why they don't yet good because
26:44 - they're thinking in terms of very very
26:46 - very very very short term now I want to
26:50 - talk about the concept of I'm going to
26:54 - write this down here it's pretty
26:55 - important not every dollar is equal so
27:00 - not every dollar is equal what the hell
27:03 - does that mean well that means that
27:05 - making ten dollars an hour from uber
27:08 - versus making ten dollars an hour from
27:11 - coding to most people that actually
27:14 - looks the same but it's the same if you
27:17 - look in the short-term value of it okay
27:21 - here's another way to think about it you
27:23 - could have 3,000 calories a day from
27:26 - coca-cola or you can have 3,000 dollars
27:29 - three thousand calories from broccoli
27:32 - okay it's the same number of calories
27:36 - but one will ruin your [ __ ] life and
27:39 - the other one will put you in a pretty
27:43 - great trajectory for your overall health
27:45 - and life okay most people don't
27:47 - understand this concept so your time
27:50 - needs to go in the thing that's really
27:52 - really valuable if you're spending your
27:54 - time and uber making short-term money
27:56 - and your goal is to do something with
27:59 - code like you have ambitions and you
28:00 - have dreams you're doing something
28:02 - horribly wrong you need to get smarter
28:04 - about it most people talk about hustle
28:07 - and stuff like that and that's great but
28:09 - if you're hustling like you're a janitor
28:10 - on the side and you're a server on the
28:13 - side and your goal is to is very
28:16 - ambitious then you're not being really
28:18 - smart about how you're going about
28:19 - because there are opportunities that
28:21 - exists in coding that you can get paid
28:24 - for today or tomorrow not as much as
28:27 - you'd like but you'd be making some
28:29 - amount of income even though it might be
28:30 - less than what you'd be making with uber
28:32 - right now so with the difference of this
28:33 - being one in a hundred almost a hundred
28:36 - times what this basically means right is
28:38 - is that if you're making $10 $10 from
28:42 - coding is greater than $10 from uber
28:45 - okay almost ten to a hundred times more
28:48 - greater we're talking about a life long
28:51 - trajectory okay if we have a life long
28:54 - trajectory of if I create a graph
28:57 - another graph and on this graph purple
29:02 - will be uber and then we'll have coding
29:06 - as orange here's a long term opportunity
29:08 - and graph that looks like so for uber it
29:11 - looks kind of like this right there's a
29:13 - lot of opportunity right now so it might
29:15 - so it kind of looks like this but the
29:17 - opportunity is on the decline so be it's
29:20 - kind of like this and say this is your
29:22 - zero and said this is your like 10 10
29:27 - years from now and we're talking about
29:31 - opportunity as a driver not the company
29:34 - uber itself the opportunity for a coding
29:37 - kind of starts off from a similar place
29:41 - except what starts to happen is it goes
29:44 - like this
29:44 - because as many Oberer jobs are losing
29:47 - you're getting more developer jobs
29:49 - because they need to create automated
29:51 - ubers to get you fired from your current
29:53 - uber job and you're probably not driving
29:56 - an uber I'm sorry I'm just I'm just
29:58 - saying that to get a point across ok it
30:01 - just means like in general what are we
30:03 - doing with our time and we just have to
30:05 - be sometimes very critical about it or
30:06 - if we just need somebody to call us out
30:07 - on it because not all the time are we
30:10 - investing our time into the best things
30:11 - are anyways so you have the curve of
30:14 - coding here the opportunity for coding
30:16 - is infinitely greater right so the time
30:20 - you're investing into coding now it's
30:22 - compounding you're building of the
30:23 - skills compounding compounding
30:25 - compounding eventually you'll start to
30:29 - approach zero
30:30 - with uber and you'll start to approach
30:33 - much more with coding and so I will
30:37 - argue that it's even more than a hundred
30:39 - times in the in a ten year span if you
30:42 - look at ten year spans it's probably
30:43 - even more than a hundred so ten dollars
30:47 - in uber to ten dollars in coding is
30:49 - actually greater than ten dollars in
30:51 - over and it's almost greater by a factor
30:53 - of a hundred so meaning that even if you
30:57 - were making $100 an hour from uber right
31:01 - now the $10 an hour from coding would
31:03 - actually be greater okay this is the
31:07 - same concept you apply to business as
31:10 - well for example I always tell people
31:12 - the thousand dollars you can earn from
31:15 - an online business is probably equal to
31:18 - like 10,000 or 20,000 dollars that you
31:20 - actually earn from working a job because
31:24 - the online business that you have is
31:26 - infinitely scalable right you see 211
31:28 - then 350 then 400 K and I don't know
31:33 - maybe I'll be out of business tomorrow
31:34 - or something we'll find out or maybe
31:37 - next year I'll hit 600 K or 700 K and
31:41 - then maybe in a few years I'll hit a
31:43 - million dollars a year or more so it
31:46 - just it depends or maybe I will not have
31:48 - a business or not have anything so we
31:50 - don't know how it gets played out but I
31:52 - did believe that the dollars were worth
31:55 - way more from business than they are
31:58 - from my job so for example late 2016
32:02 - when I made my first 47 dollars from an
32:06 - online business I lost my mind I went
32:09 - crazy I went bananas and everybody
32:12 - around me including my family they were
32:13 - like oh you made $40 that's okay that's
32:17 - cute okay nice good job good job and
32:20 - then I thought I'm like did they just
32:24 - don't understand what the vision is and
32:27 - not $47.00 that everybody was like
32:29 - giving me little Pat's on the back and
32:30 - like good job little buddy that became
32:33 - $211,000 the first year 2017 and all of
32:37 - them it was more income than almost
32:39 - everybody around me was making at the
32:41 - time
32:42 - and then it wasn't cute baby numbers
32:44 - anymore and then it became really big
32:46 - and so it just keeps getting magnified
32:48 - these are still nothing like these are
32:51 - not no numbers in the hand long scheme
32:54 - of things this is very little like this
32:56 - might not even be the business that I'm
32:57 - running a few years from now or who
33:00 - knows but the skills that I'm learning I
33:02 - get to keep them forever right so
33:04 - another thing that I want you to think
33:05 - about is if things if here's another way
33:08 - to look at it okay to judge somebody's
33:10 - character here's how I look at it if you
33:12 - just strip them completely naked you
33:14 - take everything from them their computer
33:16 - their mic there are lights their
33:18 - whiteboards their home their car their
33:22 - clothes every single thing if you take
33:24 - away every single thing what are the
33:27 - things they have in that scenario that's
33:30 - that person's worth so if you don't have
33:32 - anything with you do you still have the
33:34 - skill of being able to play the guitar
33:37 - and it's embedded inside of you and
33:39 - nobody can take that away from you
33:41 - incredible do you have this skill of
33:43 - being a runner do you have the skill of
33:46 - coding that nobody can take away from
33:48 - you right unless they stab your brain or
33:52 - they take fragments of your brain out
33:55 - and give you memory loss or memory
33:57 - damage if they can't take that away from
33:59 - you that's a skill that you have the
34:02 - more skills you have that are strategic
34:06 - to the goal that you're trying to
34:07 - achieve that are focused you will just
34:10 - become exponentially better in the long
34:12 - run at that thing and this determines
34:13 - your character this will also determine
34:15 - your income who are the people that are
34:17 - getting paid the most for example most
34:19 - people aren't even good at one thing
34:20 - that's why they make 10 15 dollars an
34:22 - hour the jobs that they can get is
34:24 - either flipping burgers becoming a
34:26 - server driving an uber because they're
34:28 - just not good at anything that people
34:30 - are actually paying for they're not
34:31 - incredible at it or they didn't decide
34:34 - strategically on what things to be good
34:36 - at for example if somebody became pretty
34:38 - damn good at guitar well you have to be
34:40 - insanely good at guitar to be able to
34:42 - make a lot of money from it so it might
34:45 - be a good thing but that's not
34:46 - necessarily related to make
34:48 - and income I didn't become good at
34:50 - coding cuz it was so enjoyable and like
34:53 - I didn't enjoy it more than chess when I
34:54 - started I didn't enjoy it more than
34:56 - soccer but I just knew that soccer would
34:59 - be a much more difficult path and I
35:02 - don't know some people are awesome and
35:03 - crazy enough to follow it but if you're
35:05 - not gonna follow it like an extreme
35:07 - which most people don't they kind of
35:09 - have asked the things well then you're
35:10 - gonna be like very average right so you
35:13 - want to spend time into the thing that's
35:14 - gonna really make you grow over the
35:16 - period of long term and those are the
35:19 - skills you keep so you really really
35:21 - want to work on your skills developing
35:24 - your skills even with my team the people
35:27 - that are on my team are incredible
35:29 - people like for example Aaron who's on
35:32 - our team so he has a skill set of being
35:37 - a developer that's pretty cool well then
35:39 - he also has the skillset to speak on
35:42 - camera that's pretty cool in itself but
35:44 - then you combine the both that's really
35:46 - powerful danny has a skill set of being
35:48 - able to teach people and empathize well
35:50 - that's pretty cool on its own but if you
35:51 - combine those all skills together that's
35:54 - really powerful and now most companies
35:57 - would want to hire him because they'll
36:00 - find out about him from the internet and
36:02 - then he's very empathetic and a person
36:05 - who should be working on people's teams
36:07 - and then he also can code and has a very
36:11 - amazing skill set in that well then
36:14 - that's really horrible that's really
36:16 - desirable
36:16 - but then you keep building other skills
36:19 - on top of that like he can do video
36:21 - editing really well and he can do
36:23 - content creation really well and he can
36:26 - create projects really well and he can
36:28 - potentially work with clients or people
36:31 - really well and so you start to stack
36:33 - them up and now it's it's a pretty
36:36 - irreplaceable skill whereas you have
36:38 - most people in life who are barely good
36:42 - at one thing much less at multiple
36:44 - different things and these are skills
36:46 - that when somebody stripped naked they
36:48 - still have them so what I mean by that
36:50 - is if you were to lose everything you
36:51 - can recreate all of this because it's
36:53 - built from skills that you have inside
36:56 - of you so this is why if you're spending
36:59 - time in two over for short-term cash
37:01 - you're just gonna get destroyed you're
37:04 - gonna get destroyed by people who are
37:05 - much more intelligent who are investing
37:08 - their time this is how compound interest
37:10 - works this is why compound interest is
37:12 - such a powerful force
37:13 - it's a exponential curve the more time
37:16 - that gets if the money gets left into a
37:19 - certain stock or whatever it starts to
37:21 - grow and compounds like insane and
37:23 - that's why it becomes so much by the
37:24 - time they're 65 well the same thing
37:26 - happens with skill sets you can you can
37:28 - go in you know I learned this concept
37:31 - from Sam ovens which is pretty awesome
37:32 - you can do you can get good at like a
37:35 - hundred different random things and
37:36 - that's pretty cool it's like really cool
37:38 - or you could just get good at one thing
37:42 - and then just be like boom right and you
37:45 - will and this is not just one thing this
37:47 - is like skills that are your building
37:50 - skills strategically in a similar thing
37:52 - for example I'm pretty good at soccer
37:53 - I'm pretty good at pool and bowling and
37:55 - juggling and all this other random stuff
37:59 - but that doesn't help me that's more
38:01 - like this this than this but then when
38:03 - I'm good at coding and I'm good at
38:05 - teaching and then I'm gonna camera and
38:07 - then I'm good at like video edit like
38:09 - all and then it starts to stack up and
38:11 - then go in like one laser line and then
38:13 - it becomes really exponential and then
38:16 - your income follows that curve and then
38:18 - it hopefully permanently follows that
38:20 - curve these are really important things
38:22 - to understand because if you don't
38:24 - understand that somebody else will
38:25 - understand it and then they will have
38:26 - the tactical advantage in life and then
38:28 - you won't so that's why you want to
38:30 - really understand these concepts and
38:33 - internalize them and just understand
38:35 - that 10 and not every dollar is equal
38:38 - and $10 an hour becoming us being a
38:41 - server is way less than not $10 an hour
38:44 - from coding so what you want to do is
38:47 - have such a strong compass that you know
38:49 - that if you're making $10 somebody would
38:54 - literally need to be paying you ten
38:56 - thousand dollars or a thousand dollars
39:01 - an hour driving uber for you to accept
39:04 - that that's how you should look at it
39:06 - that's really how you should look at it
39:08 - okay so these ten dollars are greater
39:12 - than these 100 all
39:13 - these ten dollars are a greater or equal
39:16 - to the thousand dollars an hour from
39:19 - uber okay
39:21 - so I'll do this and this is why you want
39:25 - to just spend all of your time into this
39:28 - thing so now once you understand this
39:30 - another thing that you can understand is
39:32 - okay finally even making five dollars or
39:34 - eight dollars an hour from coding and I
39:36 - can just barely make my ends meet
39:38 - somehow that's really worth it and I
39:40 - should just keep figuring out how to
39:41 - invest more time into coding the biggest
39:44 - thing that helped me was I just figured
39:46 - it out the secret to investing all of my
39:48 - time into coding and for me that was
39:51 - this thing that's really important to my
39:54 - life my journey and all of that that I
39:58 - dedicate a lot of it too is just
40:00 - tutoring ok tutoring / mentoring and
40:03 - what I was able to achieve from tutoring
40:06 - and mentoring is I was able to replace
40:09 - so I started making about $35 an hour
40:12 - teaching coding as early as like three
40:14 - months into my coding experience because
40:16 - well if I'm three months in by default
40:19 - majority of the world is behind me
40:21 - because the jury of the world has less
40:24 - than three months of experience coding
40:26 - and majority of the world are beginners
40:28 - that's why all the beginner tutorials on
40:30 - YouTube get the most views not the
40:31 - intermediate or the advanced so I wanted
40:33 - to teach people who were just behind me
40:36 - if somebody's even one step behind me
40:37 - and one thing I'm qualified to teach and
40:39 - I know this because of my years from
40:42 - 2011 all the way to 2014 from teaching
40:44 - chess to people so when I started
40:48 - coaching people in coding and I started
40:51 - mentoring and tutoring I was making
40:53 - thirty five to fifty dollars an hour and
40:55 - once I was able to do that well what
40:58 - happened was I just crossed out chess
41:00 - remember it's just as important what
41:03 - you're not doing as it is what you are
41:06 - doing so I actually just kibosh the
41:09 - chest completely right because if this
41:12 - is true then I want to be spending all
41:15 - of my time coding because it's worth ten
41:18 - times or a hundred times more in the
41:20 - long run right
41:21 - so I started earning all my income from
41:24 - teaching people coding and you know
41:27 - again I'm spending 18 hours 16 hours a
41:30 - day so my 3 months 4 months will
41:32 - probably be somebody's years and years
41:34 - and years because I also never let off
41:37 - the gas most people and I spent two
41:39 - years on something it's like to spend a
41:41 - few hours a week and then they like skip
41:45 - in the middle and to fall off and then
41:46 - they'll like spend but if you just spend
41:49 - time on it like a maniac a big chunk and
41:52 - that's all you dream about sleep about
41:55 - talk about Saul you do then you think
41:58 - again you you grow exponentially so once
42:02 - I started making 35 to 50 dollars an
42:04 - hour from teaching coding well I was
42:07 - learning this new $500 an hour skill set
42:11 - in the long scheme of things right and
42:13 - in the 10-year term thinking and I
42:18 - thought I should be paying for this time
42:22 - from my own pocket
42:24 - yet I was actually getting paid for it
42:26 - that was the most unbelievable thing and
42:29 - what that allowed me to do was now I was
42:33 - actually spending a hundred percent of
42:36 - my time coding all right I made it so
42:41 - that hundred percent of my time my
42:43 - working time was spent coding I mean I
42:45 - was so sleeping at some point but
42:47 - besides that all of my work was now
42:49 - coding it wasn't oh man I'm just trying
42:52 - to like hustle and you know I'm going to
42:54 - McDonalds man and I'm just trying to
42:55 - make the ends meet and then whatever
42:57 - time I have left when my energy is
42:59 - complete [ __ ] and I'm frustrated and I'm
43:01 - upset from doing this job that I know I
43:03 - shouldn't be doing and I come home and
43:05 - low energy speaking with my wife and my
43:09 - children and being frustrated with them
43:11 - and taking out my anger issues with them
43:13 - with that little energy that I have left
43:15 - the 30 minutes or 20 minutes of anger
43:18 - and frustration I try to work on my
43:20 - dreams with that I try to work on my
43:23 - coding with that that's what most people
43:24 - do and then they're frustrated they
43:27 - become overweight they become depressed
43:28 - they don't become good at anything
43:31 - and then it's a very very miserable life
43:34 - and instead what you want to do is you
43:35 - want to be you want to respect your
43:37 - [ __ ] dream it's your dream man you
43:39 - said it's your dream so then respect it
43:41 - the don't do the shitty job that you're
43:44 - doing right now like don't do the side
43:47 - hustle that you're doing right now like
43:48 - quit it and then start making income
43:50 - from this or start making income from
43:52 - this and then just quit that because
43:54 - you're spending your waking hours your
43:56 - most active hours your most alert hours
43:58 - on the thing that's not your dream so
44:00 - then you're not you're just not gonna
44:02 - have the life that you want that you're
44:04 - not designing the life to suit you in
44:06 - what it is that you want so you want to
44:08 - quit that a quick chess I quit whatever
44:12 - else I was doing I quit it I was trying
44:14 - to start a chess business - I have a
44:15 - youtube channel called chess tastic I
44:17 - quit that and I just focused on coding
44:20 - and that's all I did then when my skill
44:23 - set so once I started coding with a
44:25 - hundred percent of my time and my I was
44:27 - now getting money from it - well then
44:29 - what I kept doing was I kept realizing
44:31 - the following okay here's another hack
44:34 - that I realized this is pretty important
44:35 - to understand so pay attention so say I
44:37 - figured out how to charge thirty five to
44:39 - fifty dollars an hour to teach somebody
44:41 - coding because I had years and years
44:43 - 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 four or five
44:48 - years of experience freelancing
44:50 - negotiating prices
44:51 - I used that skillset to charge people 50
44:54 - dollars an hour for coding well guess
44:56 - what on platforms like code mentor i/o
44:58 - and outside world
44:59 - there were developers who were saying
45:02 - that they would charge me $50 an hour
45:04 - for their time so now think about this I
45:08 - could trade now I had a new opportunity
45:11 - an unbelievable opportunity this is
45:14 - crazy blows my mind absolutely blows my
45:17 - mind okay now what I was presented with
45:19 - was with an opportunity to trade my
45:24 - three months of experience so I'll say
45:27 - like you know three months let me ask
45:30 - you this if I gave you if I said give me
45:34 - $1 and then I will give you $100 back is
45:39 - that a good trade for you probably is
45:41 - right
45:41 - so I got to trade my three
45:43 - of experience for some developer who had
45:45 - 10 years of experience now let's
45:49 - understand this this is not this is the
45:51 - same thing as flipping on eBay or
45:56 - flipping a home something in real estate
46:00 - it's literally the same exact thing I'm
46:02 - just flipping attention and time and
46:04 - money this is the time arbitrage I'm
46:06 - exchanging my three months of time for
46:09 - somebody's ten years of time this is a
46:12 - insane deal how many months are in ten
46:15 - years
46:16 - well that's 12 months a year so this is
46:19 - a hundred and twenty months okay so
46:23 - think about it I'm trading in my three
46:25 - months for a hundred and twenty months
46:28 - of experience that's insanity
46:30 - okay and what that allows me to do is
46:33 - quickly my my fourth month will actually
46:37 - give me like five months of experience
46:39 - you see what I'm saying
46:40 - because that tutor is now helping me
46:43 - accelerate to his level faster so if I
46:47 - spend so my fourth month will really be
46:50 - the equivalent of three months so it'll
46:51 - put me at six months the month after
46:53 - that would put me at like nine months
46:54 - follow so if I'm trading my time this is
46:58 - not a fifth shouldn't be fifty dollars
47:00 - an hour what I should be paying this guy
47:02 - or gal I was working with Jessamine
47:04 - Smith most of the times and then some
47:06 - other tutors two other mentors to encode
47:08 - mentor and other platforms but if I'm
47:11 - paying fifty well this is 10 20 30 40
47:15 - times greater so I should really been
47:18 - paying 40 times more than $50 an hour I
47:20 - should be paying like my $50 an hour in
47:24 - this case should have been equal to
47:27 - what's 50 times times 40 well that's
47:30 - obviously two thousand so it should be
47:32 - two thousand or sorry the other way
47:35 - should be the other way so with this
47:37 - logic I should be paying them two
47:39 - thousand actually you know what I'm just
47:41 - gonna leave it like that so it's less
47:43 - confusing so the deal that I was
47:45 - actually getting was my fifty dollars
47:47 - for two thousand dollars in return
47:49 - that's the actual deal that I was
47:53 - getting here when I was having these
47:55 - people teach me because I will
47:57 - teach somebody coding I would make $50
47:59 - then I would just come and have a
48:00 - session with them for $50 and so I kept
48:03 - zero dollars in my bank account but in
48:05 - the long run I knew I just putting two
48:07 - thousand into my bank account two
48:08 - thousand in my bank account over and
48:10 - over again because of the skill set I
48:11 - was learning and I knew that with my
48:13 - negotiation skills and all of that if I
48:15 - had their skill set I would easily be
48:17 - charging five to ten times more so this
48:19 - was the deal that I was getting this is
48:21 - a not an equal deal this is a very
48:23 - unfair deal and that's the deal that I
48:26 - was making
48:27 - I was exchanging $50 to get two thousand
48:29 - dollars worth of value every session
48:31 - that I had over them mentoring me and
48:34 - giving me their experience because in
48:36 - the start I'm not gonna be making money
48:37 - from it that's obvious to me but a year
48:40 - or two years from that time you bet then
48:42 - that that I would then be making 100 200
48:45 - 300 ollars an hour so it would take me
48:47 - about half a year to pay off all the
48:49 - money that I put into all of this stuff
48:51 - and then six months after that would
48:53 - just be all profit and then for the
48:55 - future an eternity it would just be all
48:57 - profit in 2015 I was able to make 80 K
49:01 - from coding from just teaching people
49:02 - coding and when I had other developers
49:04 - teaching me I was improving my skill set
49:06 - really really fast and I was also
49:08 - learning on my own too obviously because
49:10 - I was super interested so you know I
49:12 - probably invested like 20k or something
49:15 - like that into my own learning 20k or
49:17 - more 20k plus into my own learning
49:20 - online courses coding courses and then
49:24 - mentors suspend this but then I made a
49:26 - lot so not a bad deal and primarily by
49:28 - teaching coding then if you fast forward
49:30 - to 2016 well then I got so good at that
49:33 - point that I picked up the skill of
49:34 - freelancing and so I made most of my
49:37 - money from teaching people coding about
49:39 - 70 to 80 K and then I picked up another
49:41 - 20 or 30 K from freelancing so I made
49:44 - about a hundred four thousand dollars in
49:47 - 2016 and that added twenty thirty K
49:51 - extra from this is from freelancing okay
49:54 - and then I got pretty good at
49:56 - freelancing because I understood how it
50:00 - worked and then I'm like okay next year
50:02 - I would crush it even more but then I
50:04 - thought but then around this time people
50:07 - were asking
50:08 - a lot of questions how did improve so
50:10 - fast how to get here so fast
50:12 - my own teacher from my computer science
50:14 - class started asking me hey how did you
50:17 - improve your skills so fast how did you
50:20 - do this and he started asking me for a
50:22 - career advice and that's when I thought
50:24 - ok maybe it's a good time to not code
50:28 - anymore and actually teach people and
50:31 - help them with their own careers and
50:32 - that's why I started the YouTube channel
50:34 - and then what happened in 2017 through
50:37 - 2019 is all just helping developers
50:40 - that's all I so again it's important
50:44 - what I'm not doing what you have to
50:45 - understand when I started 2017 I
50:47 - actually gave up all of my clients I was
50:48 - making about $10,000 a month and I just
50:50 - cut them all I cut all of my clients I
50:53 - got an office so I could have actually
50:55 - more expenses to deal with because I
50:57 - just knew I had to put myself against
50:59 - the wall and not give myself any chances
51:01 - out I also didn't have any money saved
51:03 - up I used up all my money to reinvest
51:05 - into my own self to learn the skills
51:07 - that I needed to learn and then 2017 I
51:10 - just was I thought yeah I don't want to
51:12 - I just want to improve my business and
51:15 - I'm gonna force myself to make all the
51:17 - income for my business clever programmer
51:19 - and then 2017 2018 2019 that was the
51:22 - only focus so 2014 - pretty much 2016
51:26 - only one focus coding nothing else code
51:30 - improve the skill set that's it time
51:33 - arbitrage you know 100 percent time
51:36 - spent coding these are the people people
51:38 - are not doing that's why it takes them
51:39 - 20 years to get the same results you
51:41 - know the only way they can get the same
51:43 - results if there have a job at Google or
51:45 - Facebook and you don't need that [ __ ]
51:46 - like if you understand these principles
51:48 - you know I was reading lots of books so
51:51 - I didn't mention that but audible was
51:53 - really helpful for me and I was
51:54 - listening to Rich Dad & Poor Dad I
51:58 - listened to John Sandra's book soft
52:00 - skills that had a huge impact on my life
52:01 - and 10x by Grant Cardone and just lots
52:05 - of books that hearing them and reading
52:08 - them helped change my life and change
52:11 - the way I thought completely then once
52:13 - my thoughts changed then my actions
52:15 - followed and then after my actions
52:17 - followed the results came
52:19 - for a while right each of them is a
52:21 - thought is a leading indicator and then
52:23 - everything else is a lagging indicator
52:24 - you know what is the leading and lagging
52:27 - me you keep working out for a long time
52:29 - the act of working out is a leading
52:30 - indicator and then the body changing is
52:33 - a lagging indicator so thoughts are the
52:36 - leading indicator once your thought
52:38 - starts to change well then that's the
52:39 - leading indicator once that happens the
52:42 - lagging indicators are that your actions
52:44 - start to change and then even more of a
52:46 - lagging indicator after that are the
52:48 - results then results start to come up
52:50 - after a while but all of the things that
52:53 - are really beneficial for you have very
52:54 - slow long-term impacts and they're there
52:58 - there's only long term gratification
52:59 - there's no instant gratification which
53:01 - is why most people aren't good at it
53:02 - because humans are designed for instant
53:05 - gratification and most people focus on
53:07 - just instant gratification and if you do
53:09 - that well you're not going to get most
53:11 - things that are amazing for you like
53:13 - your body transforming into the body of
53:15 - your dreams
53:15 - long-term your relationship turning into
53:18 - the relationship of your dreams
53:20 - long-term your business turning into the
53:22 - business you want long-term okay this is
53:25 - a very long term I mean this might seem
53:27 - very small to you but this is a six year
53:29 - one two three four five six it's about
53:32 - six years long transformation and
53:33 - progression I went from being really
53:36 - weak and skinny I transformed a lot of
53:39 - my own body I mean I was scrawny weak
53:42 - kid who couldn't do anything and I
53:45 - transformed my body a lot in this time I
53:47 - transformed my social skills a lot in
53:49 - this time I learned how to socialize I
53:52 - learned how to have girlfriends I
53:54 - learned how to become a better developer
53:56 - I learned how to become a better
53:58 - businessman I learned how to become a
54:00 - better a copywriter a better video
54:01 - editor a better storyteller a better
54:03 - content creator you know a better
54:05 - programmer a better developer a better
54:07 - friend Lance or better at managing
54:09 - people better at building culture better
54:11 - at reading books so all of these skills
54:14 - that start to stack up you know my whole
54:16 - life just was designed around that and I
54:18 - sacrificed a lot of things but then it
54:21 - just made me better and now I've I have
54:23 - you know I'm still not where I need to
54:25 - be but I feel like I have an amazing
54:27 - relationship I am currently working on
54:30 - my body goals and being
54:32 - a lot more consistent consistency is one
54:34 - of my weaknesses so I'm working on that
54:35 - and I'm asking for help a lot and then
54:39 - I'm just focusing on my business and
54:41 - improving that and this is a long-term
54:42 - game right most people give up and you
54:45 - just keep going so learn coding business
54:48 - okay six year long transformation takes
54:51 - a long time it's really hard it requires
54:54 - you to really enjoy it but if you start
54:56 - focusing and feeding your brain the
54:58 - right things then you're gonna be on the
55:00 - right track so you got to get out of
55:02 - your comfort zone and you have to you
55:05 - know the reason why I develop social
55:07 - skills was so I could be better at
55:08 - confrontations why should I be better at
55:10 - confrontations well whenever you're
55:12 - having a discussion or on negotiation
55:14 - most people are just [ __ ] and they
55:16 - want to get they don't understand that
55:19 - they could spend either ten years coding
55:21 - and building more experience to ask for
55:24 - a raise or just withstand the pressure
55:27 - and the awkwardness in the 20 minute
55:29 - meeting to negotiate a higher rate most
55:33 - people don't understand that and those
55:35 - 20 minutes can give you 10 years of
55:37 - results so while hustle is very
55:39 - important if you're not very strategic
55:41 - and you're not thinking well then you're
55:44 - gonna screw yourself over in the long
55:45 - run right in that same negotiation you
55:48 - could be charging $30 an hour or you
55:49 - could be charging $60 an hour but it
55:52 - requires you to be a lot more
55:54 - confrontational it requires you to sit
55:57 - through the pressure and most people are
55:59 - soft they're weak through weak-minded
56:02 - they're weak spirited they're fearful
56:05 - they're frightened so they don't want to
56:08 - stand out most developers is most
56:09 - developers so there's a high chance high
56:11 - probability that this describes you
56:13 - you're you know most developers are
56:15 - introverted and they just don't take the
56:17 - time to work on their weaknesses and I
56:20 - just don't think people understand that
56:21 - like it was very very very awkward
56:24 - difficult for me to work on my you know
56:28 - soft skills so I'm gonna write that here
56:30 - so a big thing that this is attributed
56:33 - to is soft skills all right now the word
56:37 - soft is here but don't let that trick
56:40 - you because it's actually
56:42 - very difficult to get these soft skills
56:46 - and soft skills attribute a lot a lot a
56:49 - lot a lot a lot of the success to almost
56:52 - every part of the success
56:54 - I attribute to this ok first of all I
56:57 - was freelancing since 2011 2010 that
57:01 - automatically helped me work on a lot of
57:04 - my soft skills but then what I realized
57:06 - was I could never charge more than 35 or
57:08 - 50 like $35 an hour until like 2013 or
57:12 - something and that's the time where I
57:14 - started having this really uncomfortable
57:17 - discussion with my boss and many times
57:19 - we had the discussion and then he
57:21 - actually told me that he would not allow
57:23 - me to increase to like $75 an hour and I
57:28 - even started making videos for him for
57:30 - the you know I'm like I have this idea
57:32 - the channel for this company is gonna be
57:34 - incredible and I'm not gonna say the
57:36 - name of the company because I respect
57:37 - them and they did give me an opportunity
57:39 - when I needed it so I'm like you know I
57:41 - have this idea like let me help make the
57:43 - videos chest videos for you you know the
57:46 - schools that I'm at it increased by like
57:48 - 40% 50% the amount of kids that are
57:51 - coming in so I know you're making a lot
57:53 - of good income on that and I'm just
57:54 - asking for a tiny fraction of it but
57:56 - I'll just keep improving my skill set
57:58 - I'll make videos for you guys I'll do
58:00 - more promotional stuff for you guys and
58:02 - after many different conversations he
58:04 - told me no and that was very
58:06 - uncomfortable that was hard I had to
58:08 - open myself up to rejection and then I
58:09 - didn't stop there I was like he can go
58:11 - [ __ ] himself and then I went and applied
58:14 - to other jobs and then I negotiated
58:17 - starting from 50 or $60 an hour and then
58:19 - I got those jobs and then once I got
58:21 - those jobs I told him hey I got two more
58:24 - jobs so I'm gonna be leaving this
58:25 - because I asked you to pay me more I
58:27 - deserve more I am more qualified I put
58:30 - in the work I put in the effort I have a
58:33 - lot of integrity honor and I showed up
58:34 - on time and did all the things that are
58:36 - supposed to do but you weren't paying me
58:37 - higher so I'm gonna leave and then he
58:39 - said no no no ok I'll pay you $60 so now
58:41 - I had three jobs paying me 50 to $60 an
58:44 - hour dad came from a lot of self-esteem
58:46 - a lot of pushing myself a lot of being
58:48 - uncomfortable doing the things that I
58:51 - didn't want to do
58:52 - having confrontations that I did not
58:54 - want to have that's not easy that's
58:56 - really hard that's harder than most
58:58 - other things because when people try to
59:01 - confront it literally feels like death
59:04 - to you if they're part of your body
59:06 - feels like you're gonna die so that
59:07 - other things I would do is like I would
59:09 - go to a Woodfield Mall and I would force
59:11 - myself to talk to people and I would go
59:14 - with my friend tenzin as well and we
59:15 - would force ourselves to talk to random
59:17 - strangers and have conversations and it
59:20 - was a group of five people or eight
59:21 - people or 10 people and just you
59:23 - probably listening to it or cringing
59:25 - right now and the amount of cringing
59:28 - you're doing right now tells me exactly
59:30 - what I need to know about your own soft
59:32 - skills because the more you're cringing
59:35 - right now it's more likely that your
59:38 - soft skills are actually weaker and
59:40 - you're more uncomfortable and so use
59:44 - this metric like imagine you were going
59:47 - to talk to strangers and if you're
59:50 - feeling some kind of like restriction
59:51 - that's exactly actually what's stopping
59:53 - you from doing a lot of things that
59:55 - require confrontation okay
59:57 - so we put ourselves through hell we
60:00 - would go to Woodfield Mall every day for
60:02 - 10 to 12 hours a day to talk to
60:06 - strangers because we knew we needed to
60:08 - work on our soft skills sometimes we
60:10 - would spend 12 hours not talk to a
60:12 - single stranger and we would be driving
60:13 - home and we would contemplate suicide
60:15 - like we would hate our [ __ ] lives we
60:19 - would be depressed that would come home
60:20 - and I would cry at times and so did my
60:23 - friend but we did it every day almost
60:27 - anyway to develop the muscle and skill
60:30 - set and then eventually we would just be
60:31 - talking to like random people and
60:33 - whether it was we were getting into a
60:34 - confrontation or just talking to them or
60:36 - told them to look nice or what whatever
60:38 - it was we would just do it and then we
60:41 - trained our muscle and brain to keep
60:43 - doing this and then I started having
60:44 - less and less of a problem asking for
60:47 - more because you only get what you asked
60:50 - for and you'll never get what you don't
60:52 - ask for it's just a simple rule of life
60:54 - like all the people who cry to me and
60:57 - they're like you know so great with my
60:58 - company and I did all the things and
61:00 - corporate screws you in corporate
61:02 - America just [ __ ] you
61:04 - like I spent 30 years and you know they
61:06 - never really saw the gem that I was and
61:08 - all this well it's your fault you should
61:10 - have asked for more good look but you
61:13 - know I didn't want to come off I have
61:15 - integrity there should have seen it no
61:16 - it's your fault you should have asked
61:18 - for more removed on same thing that
61:20 - happens to people in relationships
61:21 - they're like I don't do the other person
61:23 - doesn't see the gem that I am and the
61:25 - value that I bring and all of this is it
61:27 - treat me like [ __ ] and they abused me
61:29 - and all this it's your fault for being
61:31 - in the relationship I'm never on the
61:32 - side of the person who's the victim like
61:34 - sometimes maybe yeah like if you're
61:36 - being bullied and stuff and you have no
61:37 - choice sure look I understand how
61:39 - psychologically traumatizing it can be I
61:41 - grew up in a religious school where I
61:43 - got the [ __ ] beat out of me every single
61:45 - day it was like physical and mental
61:47 - torture for four years every single day
61:49 - in a row from the age of 9 to 13 I would
61:52 - come home with bruises at borderline
61:54 - broken elbows but I couldn't tell my
61:55 - parents because then I would get beat up
61:57 - even more so I mean I understand and I
62:00 - respect that but when you're in that
62:01 - situation where you have a shitty
62:02 - relationship we have a shitty boss it's
62:04 - your fault they're not shitty they were
62:06 - allowed to be shitty because of people
62:08 - who are sheeps right so this when I said
62:11 - soft skills it's not so soft you can't
62:14 - read one book and it'll change you this
62:17 - actually took years like 24 I did this
62:19 - in 20 14 15 16 17 18 like this was like
62:24 - five years long journey and then what
62:26 - did this help me with well what it
62:27 - helped me with was when I had to do a
62:29 - negotiation for $50 an hour for a
62:31 - freelancing client I negotiated them
62:33 - $200 an hour other things that helped me
62:35 - with I had a chest client who was I was
62:38 - gonna they were gonna pay me $60 an hour
62:40 - and I was like either you pay me $150 an
62:44 - hour because I have to drive pretty far
62:45 - or just we just won't do it
62:47 - they initially said yeah let's just not
62:49 - do it but then eventually a week later
62:51 - they came back and said okay we'll pay
62:52 - you $150 an hour and then they did it
62:54 - and they just paid me hundred fifty
62:56 - dollars an hour and that was it in 2017
62:58 - 2018 like when I had to charge for my
63:02 - course for a profitable programmer I had
63:04 - a knack little [ __ ] [ __ ] and charge
63:07 - $10 like most people do on udemy because
63:09 - they're making bad courses and they're
63:12 - scared they're also scared
63:14 - so they charge $10 or $5 I don't care
63:17 - about that
63:18 - I'm not scared I have the best course so
63:21 - then I will charge $500 for it and not
63:23 - feel bad and people will pay me and then
63:26 - we will give them the respect and
63:28 - integrity and everything to deserve and
63:30 - we will help them succeed to the best of
63:31 - our abilities and we have a lot of
63:33 - clients and customers for super
63:36 - incredibly happy satisfied and getting
63:38 - amazing results and then that's the
63:39 - thing right we'll do a great job but
63:41 - then we'll also charge for it and then
63:44 - it won't be charity and then it's just
63:45 - as simple as that
63:46 - and that's just how life works you just
63:48 - get what you like you literally just get
63:51 - what you asked for nobody has ever
63:53 - gotten stuff that didn't ask for every
63:57 - single person who's on YouTube and has
63:58 - patreon they're not asking for anything
64:01 - and that's precisely why they're also
64:03 - just barely surviving that's how most
64:05 - YouTube channels are working and while
64:07 - it makes them feel great and they don't
64:10 - have strong enough soft skills to charge
64:12 - what they're worth it's killing their
64:14 - overall business happiness it causes
64:16 - them to burn out they don't actually
64:17 - have a real business from it when it
64:20 - comes to freelancing most people don't
64:23 - have the soft skills to charge the price
64:25 - that they should be charging they're
64:26 - very very scared and so then you just
64:29 - always get the lower end of the stick in
64:31 - life when you don't demand excellence
64:34 - and you don't ask for bigger and better
64:36 - things relationships money health and
64:40 - all of that okay so soft skills is a
64:42 - very very very huge portion of it
64:45 - everybody has a different journey about
64:48 - how to actually go and do this but you
64:50 - actually have to do it you just have to
64:52 - put in the work books won't help you
64:54 - here you have to actually put it in
64:55 - action so there's that and then you know
65:00 - other other things soft skills help me
65:01 - with was when I started making deals
65:03 - with people to do affiliate partnerships
65:05 - with I was able to charge a lot of
65:07 - income for that okay affiliate
65:10 - partnerships are business partnerships
65:12 - okay that's what it helped with so yeah
65:13 - every every result like this one be 100k
65:16 - right now this would be 50k if I didn't
65:18 - have soft skills this wouldn't be 80k it
65:20 - would be about 40 or 30 so that's that's
65:22 - what it helped me with and if I didn't
65:24 - have those skills I wouldn't have this
65:26 - channel
65:26 - they also help me but like having
65:29 - confidence more confidence speaking to
65:31 - the camera speaking to people not having
65:33 - anxiety around it and then I know you
65:36 - know so this is up to 2014's it 16 I
65:39 - don't really want to get too much into
65:41 - 2017 to 2019 because I feel like that
65:43 - starts to get out of people's brains
65:45 - really quickly especially on this
65:46 - channel because I realized that most
65:49 - people on this channel just want to do
65:50 - coding but again I said I'm making this
65:52 - video for my older self and my older
65:54 - self would probably appreciate this
65:55 - information so I'm gonna share that so
65:58 - 2017 2019 it was all about growing the
66:01 - YouTube channel growing the audience
66:03 - around coding and and I think for
66:05 - somebody who's becoming a developer like
66:06 - it's a pretty good tract
66:07 - you should be documenting your coding
66:09 - journey to build a personal brand around
66:10 - coding
66:11 - I mean everybody's doing it now Joshua
66:13 - fluke you have like coding rice and you
66:15 - have like all kinds of random channels
66:17 - like everybody's doing it right
66:18 - Jarvis Johnson did it a simple
66:20 - programmer who was one of the og Zoran
66:22 - coding and building a personal brand
66:24 - around it traversée media you know like
66:28 - think about it like why is tech lead you
66:31 - know what why is he on on YouTube right
66:35 - he's working at Facebook so shouldn't he
66:36 - just like shut the [ __ ] up and work
66:38 - there and why he was also working at
66:41 - Google so why is he on you to what what
66:43 - is he doing on YouTube well because
66:46 - there's much more money to make on
66:48 - YouTube and there's much more attention
66:50 - that you get on YouTube that's why he's
66:51 - selling his course interview Pro or
66:54 - something like that with Joel my tech
66:55 - that's why Joma Tech is on YouTube he's
66:59 - also in San Francisco and doing well so
67:03 - why is he like think about it right why
67:04 - are people who are at the top doing this
67:06 - because well personal brand around
67:09 - becoming a developer is actually
67:11 - insanely profitable and it's a and then
67:16 - also it gives you limitless job
67:19 - opportunities so it's a good track to
67:21 - follow this you know increase your skill
67:23 - set and then build a brand around it
67:25 - like Stefan Mis joke is now doing it I
67:26 - mean just there's so many developers I
67:29 - mean it's almost like more developers
67:31 - are doing this now then then not you
67:33 - know that's YouTube is becoming the
67:35 - default and pretty soon everybody will
67:36 - catch on so it's a
67:38 - time for you to do it before everybody
67:40 - every single developer catches on you
67:43 - know life of Luba and then some other
67:46 - kid just started the other day yeah
67:48 - there's just too many they're getting
67:49 - out of control first night I mean Derek
67:51 - bat Manas is one of the oh geez New
67:54 - Boston was one of the oh geez and then
67:56 - everybody just jumped on the bandwagon
67:57 - including me and then we just you know
68:00 - we we grew our platforms and I'm yeah so
68:03 - you know 2016 a few months of it and
68:07 - 2017 it was like growing attention on
68:10 - YouTube and then selling a digital
68:11 - product you know growing attention on
68:13 - YouTube selling a digital product
68:15 - growing attention on YouTube selling a
68:16 - digital products it's pretty like linear
68:18 - straight forward I mean this year we did
68:21 - learn a lot about Facebook ads and
68:23 - YouTube ads and then we grew the
68:25 - business from that and now the focus is
68:27 - primarily just to help developers become
68:29 - developers and then go on a similar path
68:31 - like pretty soon if there's a demand for
68:33 - it I will also be docked like I can also
68:36 - be making courses or some kind of
68:38 - guidance on this path of 20 17 18 and 19
68:41 - and then how I actually grew the
68:44 - business around it so quickly and then
68:46 - generated an income because sure
68:48 - everybody has a YouTube channel but like
68:49 - I have very difficult time believing
68:51 - that most developers on that have a
68:54 - youtube channel or generating in this
68:57 - amount of range maybe but you need a
69:00 - real business not you know you need a
69:02 - real business where you have real
69:04 - customers who are actually satisfied
69:06 - clients okay you can't grow to this from
69:09 - YouTube ads that would be really hard
69:11 - really really really hard so yeah I mean
69:14 - that's the trajectory of the personal
69:16 - brand this is how it was built
69:18 - I think it's pretty good model for
69:19 - developers to follow you can't really go
69:22 - wrong and the skills that are permanent
69:24 - and I always want my skills to be
69:26 - permanent like for example if coding
69:27 - dies is a year from now or two years
69:29 - from now it really wouldn't matter to
69:31 - mean that much because I have the skill
69:32 - set of creating content I have the skill
69:35 - set of copywriting I have skill set of
69:37 - creating a product I have a skill set of
69:39 - selling a product of the skill set of
69:41 - having happy customers getting
69:43 - testimonials creating a team creating a
69:46 - culture like all of these skill sets and
69:47 - so if tomorrow
69:49 - clever programmer
69:50 - or you or something happens to YouTube
69:53 - or something happens to say the Z market
69:57 - of coding or Python or whatever it may
69:59 - be if there's a disaster tomorrow or the
70:00 - year after that whatever I have skill
70:02 - sets to then go into something else that
70:06 - I'm excited about tomorrow or going to
70:08 - another business so you always want to
70:09 - build your skill sets in a way that
70:10 - leaves you permanently flexible and
70:13 - permanently growing so there you have it
70:15 - that's how I made my first $1,000,000 in

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys what's up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm and this video is gonna be a little bit different than a lot of the videos that I make and this video it's not going to be flashy there's gonna not be that many edits and I am just gonna document and talk about my journey to my first $1,000,000 in the last two and a half years and because this video will be more for developers because this is the developer channel clever programmer I am gonna talk about things that can potentially help you and maybe it can help you on your journey or you can have a similar pattern but really this video is just for the older me so if there's an older me out there who has the same type of dreams the same type of ambitions my goal is just to kind of make this a message for him or her so I hope you enjoy it I've put together incredible training for you to help you become a sixfigure developer so you can earn the income you want you can have the time money and the freedom and the impact that you want to have in this world the link is below click on the link it'll take you to the training just put in your email I'll send you this masterclass it's threepart series it'll absolutely blow your mind completely free go there do it now and I'll see you on the other side kind of get into this video and there are a few important concepts that I'm gonna be talking about along this I'm probably gonna be talking about the concept of like hime arbitrage I'm gonna be talking about like value versus money and skills and probably many other things more the big thing is I'm gonna really free flow this and yeah I just talk through kind of like I'm talking with other person so let's just kind of get started 2014 is when I actually started coding so I'm gonna put that as started these are the years 2017 through 2019 where I generated a million plus dollars my first one and I've documented this entire series that I'll put out at some point on my personal brand this is that but this part of it starting from 2014 was pivotal because if this didn't happen and this wouldn't have happened in this year from coding I didn't really earn an income 2014 mostly I didn't earn that much income I just learned how to code I did know principles of freelancing because I was an instructor like a chess instructor and then I would go and teach people how to play chess and then I would charge for that and so people were paying me you know anywhere from $35 an hour at $150 an hour to teach them chests I'm about 2,000 USCF rated as a chess player but so it basically means like I'm a good chess player not the best chess player because the best players are around 2,500 2,600 but I developed a skill of freelancing in my earlier years so for me that was really really important so you know freelancing I'll write that here that was a really important skill that I actually started developing way before 2014 I was developing the skill of freelancing from really 2011 to 2014 so I had lots of experience freelancing I never did a full time job a single time in my life I actually instead just did chess and taught chess as an instructor and I've worked as an independent contractor forever so whether it was I was doing oneonone lessons or I was teaching a classroom full of kids it was always as a freelancer independent contractor okay so I started coding here 2015 was I'll just map out the years so for example 2015 I made roughly 80k 80k so that's $80,000 in one year 20152016 I made one hundred and four thousand and something changed 2016 from coding but I will just round I'll just say 100k and then I started my business of clever programmer at the end of 2016 and 2017 to 2019 currently my focus is just clever programmer and nothing else so um my goal is to just help developers now primarily I don't do any freelancing I don't teach coding anymore I don't have time for any of that I just have time to dedicate to this business to help people become developers so after 20152016 I basically realized hey like it's cool that I'm making 100k it's really awesome but even if I worked harder and became more incredible I would maybe get the 200k a year after many many years and then I would get to like 300k and that kind of would be the extent of that maybe math and I realized okay I could actually make a lot more income if I started a business and helped other people because it just makes sense for example by myself I can only change the life of myself and that's one person but through the scale of the internet I could potentially change the lives or helped tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people on their journey so if I could help hundreds of thousands of people on their journey well then that means that my income would likely increase more than a hundred thousand dollars a year and because I'm also helping other people increase their income so it's beneficial for everybody the impact is much bigger so the income is much bigger 2017 was my first year in business and I did 211 K 2018 was I think somewhere like 350 K and then 2019 we're already at 350 K and it's September so we have a few more months to go so we're projected to probably do maybe 400 or something like that you know projection so I'll just say like 400 K and I'll leave it at that so if you map out this these are the two and a half years more than 1 million was generated with then I don't know if you can see this or not very clearly but I'm just I'm trying my best here but yeah more like about 1 million dollars for general was generator this period sure you can add this too so all of this is from coding yeah now I'm pretty much gonna just talk about like what I did every year 2014 for me was all about just increasing my skill set like in coding that was it so 2014 i remember that i 2014 i actually got started 2014 or right around i believe august august 10th was the day i committed to coding that was the day I started with my best friend Tenzin and Tenzin and I just started coding right around that time I think he I convinced him his channels called what's dev and I convinced him to quit his job at CVS like a month later and then he started coding with me so then we were both doing it at the same time I don't I owe a lot to him because I don't think I would have continued coding if I didn't have another person there with me so it was awesome and we just kind of went hard at it so this Tenzin I just learning coding for about like 15 to 18 hours a day so let's see here about let's just average it out to 16 hours per day coding now there were a lot of things that I wouldn't recommend a person does such as like really eating unhealthy foods and you know not really taking the best care of yourself having Monster energy drinks all the time malnutrition lack of sleep so that's not good like you'd probably want to avoid all of those things but you know we we didn't we just all we did was code so we wanted to get that skill set like I understood how important it was to get this skill set it was more important than anything I knew that's money followed value and I started to understand this concept around like 2014 ish I started reading audible I listened to Johnson misses book that was really really valuable for me so I'll point out the key things for me in my earlier well actually I don't think I read that to later when I started coding I yeah I didn't even know who Johnson was was actually I I found out about him later so I'm not gonna write about that right this second will come later so 2014 it was about 16 hours of coding I went to a place called ps1 in Chicago and that's where I would code it was a coworking space and I along with Tenzin would code I actually we started in the basement of my house and in the basement of my house we would code every day every single day and I would code every single day and I remember I learned about you know command line and got really good at it command line is a really amazing skill to have that just a lot of developers try to avoid and then they get screwed over later so they tried to use everything with the GUI they'll try to learn like get from the GUI and they'll learn all these things for like everything that are like opening up desktops and putting things into it you know their mouse and what ends up happening is that they lack the skill of command line and then it comes to bite you in their house a lot later so you probably want to avoid you want to avoid that you want to work on the skills that really really will help you and these types of skills like command line there's no such thing as instant gratification it's brutal it's painful it's not fun it's not fun to look at there's just no satisfaction you get out of it besides just feeling like an elitist that's the only satisfaction that I got out of it when I was doing I just felt like an elitist and I thought wow this makes me really [ __ ] cool and probably nobody else is doing it so yeah I'm just gonna keep doing it command line was a pretty important skill I learned I learned obviously the Python skills so all I did was Python I was taking courses on Coursera Udacity team treehouse headaches cs50 I mean I was just taking all of the courses that you could imagine and then I was just completing a lot of them back to back to back to back the courses that helped me the most was Coursera had intro interactive intro and interactive programming with Python something like III PP intro to interactive programming with Python yeah so I IPP there was a course by Coursera I pp 1 then there was part 2 and then there was principles of computing part 1 and then there was principles of computing part 2 so these were this was intermediate this was more beginner but I mean it gets pretty advanced you're building a lot of different things so it was an it was honestly like my curiosity for coding my love for it how fascinating I found the concepts I mean it was really really intriguing to me you know learning about the by nor what is it binomial theorem I don't do a lot with it anymore but when I learned about it blew my mind I just found it fascinating so I kept I just kept doing more and more of it and picked up this skill set of code like problem solving really well because I was just spending a lot of time around it I learned recursion the other important things that I learned because I ended up picking up the commandline I learned get versus get hub fairly quickly so that was another really important skill for me to have under my belt it played out in my favor hugely because this is where recruiters are looking and most people don't think about that skill for a really long time and I just start working on it pretty much right away some tips I will give you from my learnings were that when I was coding the thing that helped me really improve my skill set was I didn't just follow the tutorials I would go off and I would do my own thing for example if the tutorial was tictactoe or rockpaperscissors or something I would follow it to a certain extent and then I would turn it into a completely different game I would take it from rock paper scissors to turned into rock scissors papers lizardspock or I would take that same rock paper scissors that I was taught how to made on Python and then try to host it online so there were a lot of different things that I would try to do and that really really helped 2014 I didn't spend any time learning web development I didn't spend any time learning like I think it's also really important to talk about what I didn't do because people try to do too much my friend Tenzin the problem that kept happening with him for a while before this was that he had known about coding way before I ever did so he knew about coding when he was like 10 or 11 years old and he was making websites in HTML and CSS and all this and I actually found out more about coding in the start from him then he did for me because he knew more about it in the start and when he was 11 12 13 like he would keep building a website for following tutorials on team tree house things like that but then as time progressed he would go through the tutorial and not do anything else and then come back didn't go through the tutorial then come back then go through a tutorial then come back he would have a lot of time in between the time he would take off from coding so it was almost like he would work really hard to build this wall and then he would leave and during a bad season or war or whatever the wall would break down and then he would be like damn and then he would come back after months to build up the wall that's all that kept happening and that's what's known as tutorial purgatory and a lot of people fall victim to that and they allow tutorial purgatory to really control major aspects of their lives and affect them in horrible horrible ways but the one thing that was good that I was doing was I just never picked my head up like I just kept my head down and I just kept going so it was a Python and I just didn't do anything else so I didn't do HTML all right I didn't do CSS I didn't do JavaScript I didn't do Java I didn't just keep doing tutorial after tutorial and then just keep starting from scratch I just kept moving forward so I just stuck to one thing it doesn't matter you can pick Python you can pick job you can pick JavaScript it really doesn't matter just pick one thing and then just do it and then just don't stop forever that's how you get good because getting good is a very weird if there was a curve for getting good and you had like it's kind of a really shitty feeling cuz if you started you don't just let me make it with the different moniker so you can see if the line looks like but getting good is a really weird curve kind of looks like this whatever are you doing just doesn't make any difference at all so it just keeps going straight straight straight straight straight straight and then it starts to build on top of itself on top of itself on top of stuff and then you just start getting exponentially better and better better every single day and then you start to plateau and and then you have very small increase forever this is the area that people just give up on so people will quit here in their coding journey they'll quit here they'll quit here they'll quit here they'll quit here hell they might even quit here but then when you're on this curve and you get path and you pass it you're never coming back you're so high up on this hill you can't even see down here so you don't even remember what it feels like to be in tutorial purgatory or whatever and so what happens to most people is they'll start programming and they'll quit start quite start quit start quit start quit quit after tutorials and whatever and that's why they're always tough here and they keep changing things they're like I'm gonna learn web development then they're like I'm gonna learn this language then they're like what other is the top four programming languages okay I'll learn this you have to understand that when I started learning Python it wasn't popular it wasn't that popular now it's the number one programming language in the world it destroys everything it shifts on JavaScript Java anything right it's simple just look at the Pipal index pop popularity of a programming language look at Google Trends and it just dominates here's another simple test go to YouTube just type in Python and look at the top videos and the views they'll be like 8 million 10 million look at JavaScript it'll be like 1 million look at Java be like less than 1 million or million so certain things are really basic to understand and that's how you'll understand like what thing is popular and what not but when I started it wasn't the most pop other languages or were much more popular and I just I actually picked it because I felt like nobody would know about it I never heard the name Python I heard people talk about Java I heard people talk about JavaScript and all this other crap but I never heard anybody talk about Python so I thought that's why I should pick it because I am a contrarian and I love doing the things other people aren't doing because contradiction is where the geniuses contradiction is where Einstein lived and contradiction is where Warren Buffett live and contradiction is where Steve Jobs lived and contradiction is just where the geniuses so you wanna you go with average you'll get average results and so don't go with average anyways so it was really important what I didn't do that I think is really important to highlight and it just kept making consistent progress so like I went from projects projects than more advanced classes more advanced classes and then I just taught myself almost all of the coding and then I did a lot of it on my own by doing my own projects and things like that that was about 2014 honestly there was also a lot of 2015 what I did because I just understood how important the skillset was and the reach and then I just went all in because if I pick up the skill then I knew I knew money followed value and so if I picked up the skill then I just knew that money would come along with it at some point because that's just how many works money is not this weird static thing that most people think about and take in and just sit on it with their ass and they hold it close to their chest and they're scared to spend it on learning new things but they're very okay with spending it on things that give them instant gratification so most people will you know nobody thinks buying a laptop or TVs a scam because instant gratification right you buy it and you have it but most people have a lot of trouble spending money for education or training or whatever gives them benefits in the long term because well that's a scam because you're not getting anything immediately and when people don't get anything immediately their little brains get very hurt and they feel weird about it right so what I was doing in a lot of the 2014 2015 was I learned that okay if I'm making money from chess and say I was making thirty five to fifty dollars an hour and if coding was a higher paying skill set than chess so if I understood that coding is gonna be greater than chess like moneywise right dollar wise and opportunity wise and things like that the need for it I mean chess is a hobby coding is something that the world depends on there's a big difference well then I thought okay how many times is it better and I would say that it's almost five to ten times better the opportunity for coding well if the opportunity is five to ten times better than if I'm making a hundred and fifty dollars or let's 9150 let's just say if I was making $50 for a chess coaching session for an hour of my time well that $50 in the coding world is worth a lot more in the long run it's either worth it's worth somewhere like three hundred five hundred dollars and the reason I say that is because there's no chess job you can do fulltime there's no chess job you can do 20 hours a week but there coding jobs you can do twenty forty hours a week so even even though it doesn't mean that I'll be making $500 an hour from coding it just does mean that over the course of a week I would make a lot more income and I would help a lot more more people from coding than I would a chess right so then I learned so then I thought okay these fifty dollars are actually either less than or equal to coding like five hundred dollars okay so one time so once I made this conclusion I thought okay well all I need to do is trade my chess skill for coding skill that's really it so if I could trade my chess skill for coding skill then I would go really really far and I thought okay what's the best way to do that so obviously therefore courses and that's helpful but I mean think about any Olympic athlete right that you know of the best in the world none of them became the best in the world by taking courses and learning by themselves most of them became Olympic level athletes could they have coaching every day the best students that you can think about in you know who are killing it in all their exams in everything they have tutoring every day so I understood that I would need mentoring and I understood that I would need it pretty consistently so I thought okay well what I can do is I can pay let me clean up some part of the board it's not ok what I can actually do is I can I can pay a coding mentor 50 dollars an hour and learn coding so any money that I was actually making from my chess I thought well I could just reinvest it into coding the arbitrage is huge because I'm spending $50 that's almost equal to five hundred dollars in the long run because I'm trading my chess skill set for the coding skill set so I'm paying 50 I'm learning from somebody who has ten years of experience in the software development world because I would go to a platform like code mentor dot IO or something like that and this video is not sponsored by them or whatever and I would just pay a mentor so it's not okay if I paid a mentor $50 an hour from my chess and I learned coding is essentially like I'll just training chess for coding for almost an equal price except I know that the value for coding and the opportunity for coding is ten times more so I'm just trading in one skill set for another right you could do the same thing for example if you're driving an uber right now or you drive a truck right now or you are doing IT desk job well think about it right if you're doing an IT job maybe you're making $15 an hour and pretty soon you're gonna be replaced because it's a mindless job and so you're not you're not bringing that much value to the world so AI is gonna replace you and then you're gonna be making $0 so think about how much coding like how much opportunity there is for coding versus uber so let's just say you drive an uber right so you let's say that there's coding on this hand and I'm gonna make the claim that coding opportunities more than uber driving opportunity because they're already coming out with selfdriving cars five years ten years from now they're gonna be non drivers okay but most people like want instant gratification that's another thing I want to talk about now if you're driving an uber and you want to become a developer that's a pretty stupid thing to do because think about it this is a $10 an hour skill set so $10 an hour skill set let's say you're driving people around doesn't require any skill you and almost anybody can drive as long as you have arms and legs you can drive you know versus coding I would argue like how many times more opportunity is there don't think in terms of don't even think in terms of dollars think in terms of how much more opportunity there is for coding right so let's say if this is like opportunity and let's just say this is a onein opportunity how many times more is the opportunity for coding especially as we head into the future versus uber I would argue that it's probably fifty to a hundred times more opportunity and when I say opportunity I mean like not just how many available jobs there are because there are a lot of probably a lot of jobs available for uber everybody can get one job from uber but what I mean is that one how much income then to the how long you will be satisfied doing this versus uber I mean I will shoot myself if I did over for like a week now imagine doing it for years right that gets very crazy very quickly so there is less satisfaction but then outside of that you're not increasing your income and what other things is they gonna help you in life it's not gonna help you in business later it's not gonna help you if you want to get a really big promotion it's not gonna help you form to become a manager at some company it's not gonna help you with creating some kind of startup it's not gonna help you building passive income it just fits in with no goal whereas coding can fit in later with you wanting to start a business it fits in with you doing something even completely different from coding and then the opportunity for coding and developers is growing as well because all artificial intelligence and all of that will require people to program it and then maybe we can argue that a hundred years from now it wouldn't need developers but you know I'm fine with a hundred years because then I'll be dead and then it doesn't matter anymore so I would say that the opportunity for coding is a hundred times more why is somebody spending time here that's a big mistake big mistake people make and that's why they don't yet good because they're thinking in terms of very very very very very short term now I want to talk about the concept of I'm going to write this down here it's pretty important not every dollar is equal so not every dollar is equal what the hell does that mean well that means that making ten dollars an hour from uber versus making ten dollars an hour from coding to most people that actually looks the same but it's the same if you look in the shortterm value of it okay here's another way to think about it you could have 3,000 calories a day from cocacola or you can have 3,000 dollars three thousand calories from broccoli okay it's the same number of calories but one will ruin your [ __ ] life and the other one will put you in a pretty great trajectory for your overall health and life okay most people don't understand this concept so your time needs to go in the thing that's really really valuable if you're spending your time and uber making shortterm money and your goal is to do something with code like you have ambitions and you have dreams you're doing something horribly wrong you need to get smarter about it most people talk about hustle and stuff like that and that's great but if you're hustling like you're a janitor on the side and you're a server on the side and your goal is to is very ambitious then you're not being really smart about how you're going about because there are opportunities that exists in coding that you can get paid for today or tomorrow not as much as you'd like but you'd be making some amount of income even though it might be less than what you'd be making with uber right now so with the difference of this being one in a hundred almost a hundred times what this basically means right is is that if you're making $10 $10 from coding is greater than $10 from uber okay almost ten to a hundred times more greater we're talking about a life long trajectory okay if we have a life long trajectory of if I create a graph another graph and on this graph purple will be uber and then we'll have coding as orange here's a long term opportunity and graph that looks like so for uber it looks kind of like this right there's a lot of opportunity right now so it might so it kind of looks like this but the opportunity is on the decline so be it's kind of like this and say this is your zero and said this is your like 10 10 years from now and we're talking about opportunity as a driver not the company uber itself the opportunity for a coding kind of starts off from a similar place except what starts to happen is it goes like this because as many Oberer jobs are losing you're getting more developer jobs because they need to create automated ubers to get you fired from your current uber job and you're probably not driving an uber I'm sorry I'm just I'm just saying that to get a point across ok it just means like in general what are we doing with our time and we just have to be sometimes very critical about it or if we just need somebody to call us out on it because not all the time are we investing our time into the best things are anyways so you have the curve of coding here the opportunity for coding is infinitely greater right so the time you're investing into coding now it's compounding you're building of the skills compounding compounding compounding eventually you'll start to approach zero with uber and you'll start to approach much more with coding and so I will argue that it's even more than a hundred times in the in a ten year span if you look at ten year spans it's probably even more than a hundred so ten dollars in uber to ten dollars in coding is actually greater than ten dollars in over and it's almost greater by a factor of a hundred so meaning that even if you were making $100 an hour from uber right now the $10 an hour from coding would actually be greater okay this is the same concept you apply to business as well for example I always tell people the thousand dollars you can earn from an online business is probably equal to like 10,000 or 20,000 dollars that you actually earn from working a job because the online business that you have is infinitely scalable right you see 211 then 350 then 400 K and I don't know maybe I'll be out of business tomorrow or something we'll find out or maybe next year I'll hit 600 K or 700 K and then maybe in a few years I'll hit a million dollars a year or more so it just it depends or maybe I will not have a business or not have anything so we don't know how it gets played out but I did believe that the dollars were worth way more from business than they are from my job so for example late 2016 when I made my first 47 dollars from an online business I lost my mind I went crazy I went bananas and everybody around me including my family they were like oh you made $40 that's okay that's cute okay nice good job good job and then I thought I'm like did they just don't understand what the vision is and not $47.00 that everybody was like giving me little Pat's on the back and like good job little buddy that became $211,000 the first year 2017 and all of them it was more income than almost everybody around me was making at the time and then it wasn't cute baby numbers anymore and then it became really big and so it just keeps getting magnified these are still nothing like these are not no numbers in the hand long scheme of things this is very little like this might not even be the business that I'm running a few years from now or who knows but the skills that I'm learning I get to keep them forever right so another thing that I want you to think about is if things if here's another way to look at it okay to judge somebody's character here's how I look at it if you just strip them completely naked you take everything from them their computer their mic there are lights their whiteboards their home their car their clothes every single thing if you take away every single thing what are the things they have in that scenario that's that person's worth so if you don't have anything with you do you still have the skill of being able to play the guitar and it's embedded inside of you and nobody can take that away from you incredible do you have this skill of being a runner do you have the skill of coding that nobody can take away from you right unless they stab your brain or they take fragments of your brain out and give you memory loss or memory damage if they can't take that away from you that's a skill that you have the more skills you have that are strategic to the goal that you're trying to achieve that are focused you will just become exponentially better in the long run at that thing and this determines your character this will also determine your income who are the people that are getting paid the most for example most people aren't even good at one thing that's why they make 10 15 dollars an hour the jobs that they can get is either flipping burgers becoming a server driving an uber because they're just not good at anything that people are actually paying for they're not incredible at it or they didn't decide strategically on what things to be good at for example if somebody became pretty damn good at guitar well you have to be insanely good at guitar to be able to make a lot of money from it so it might be a good thing but that's not necessarily related to make and income I didn't become good at coding cuz it was so enjoyable and like I didn't enjoy it more than chess when I started I didn't enjoy it more than soccer but I just knew that soccer would be a much more difficult path and I don't know some people are awesome and crazy enough to follow it but if you're not gonna follow it like an extreme which most people don't they kind of have asked the things well then you're gonna be like very average right so you want to spend time into the thing that's gonna really make you grow over the period of long term and those are the skills you keep so you really really want to work on your skills developing your skills even with my team the people that are on my team are incredible people like for example Aaron who's on our team so he has a skill set of being a developer that's pretty cool well then he also has the skillset to speak on camera that's pretty cool in itself but then you combine the both that's really powerful danny has a skill set of being able to teach people and empathize well that's pretty cool on its own but if you combine those all skills together that's really powerful and now most companies would want to hire him because they'll find out about him from the internet and then he's very empathetic and a person who should be working on people's teams and then he also can code and has a very amazing skill set in that well then that's really horrible that's really desirable but then you keep building other skills on top of that like he can do video editing really well and he can do content creation really well and he can create projects really well and he can potentially work with clients or people really well and so you start to stack them up and now it's it's a pretty irreplaceable skill whereas you have most people in life who are barely good at one thing much less at multiple different things and these are skills that when somebody stripped naked they still have them so what I mean by that is if you were to lose everything you can recreate all of this because it's built from skills that you have inside of you so this is why if you're spending time in two over for shortterm cash you're just gonna get destroyed you're gonna get destroyed by people who are much more intelligent who are investing their time this is how compound interest works this is why compound interest is such a powerful force it's a exponential curve the more time that gets if the money gets left into a certain stock or whatever it starts to grow and compounds like insane and that's why it becomes so much by the time they're 65 well the same thing happens with skill sets you can you can go in you know I learned this concept from Sam ovens which is pretty awesome you can do you can get good at like a hundred different random things and that's pretty cool it's like really cool or you could just get good at one thing and then just be like boom right and you will and this is not just one thing this is like skills that are your building skills strategically in a similar thing for example I'm pretty good at soccer I'm pretty good at pool and bowling and juggling and all this other random stuff but that doesn't help me that's more like this this than this but then when I'm good at coding and I'm good at teaching and then I'm gonna camera and then I'm good at like video edit like all and then it starts to stack up and then go in like one laser line and then it becomes really exponential and then your income follows that curve and then it hopefully permanently follows that curve these are really important things to understand because if you don't understand that somebody else will understand it and then they will have the tactical advantage in life and then you won't so that's why you want to really understand these concepts and internalize them and just understand that 10 and not every dollar is equal and $10 an hour becoming us being a server is way less than not $10 an hour from coding so what you want to do is have such a strong compass that you know that if you're making $10 somebody would literally need to be paying you ten thousand dollars or a thousand dollars an hour driving uber for you to accept that that's how you should look at it that's really how you should look at it okay so these ten dollars are greater than these 100 all these ten dollars are a greater or equal to the thousand dollars an hour from uber okay so I'll do this and this is why you want to just spend all of your time into this thing so now once you understand this another thing that you can understand is okay finally even making five dollars or eight dollars an hour from coding and I can just barely make my ends meet somehow that's really worth it and I should just keep figuring out how to invest more time into coding the biggest thing that helped me was I just figured it out the secret to investing all of my time into coding and for me that was this thing that's really important to my life my journey and all of that that I dedicate a lot of it too is just tutoring ok tutoring / mentoring and what I was able to achieve from tutoring and mentoring is I was able to replace so I started making about $35 an hour teaching coding as early as like three months into my coding experience because well if I'm three months in by default majority of the world is behind me because the jury of the world has less than three months of experience coding and majority of the world are beginners that's why all the beginner tutorials on YouTube get the most views not the intermediate or the advanced so I wanted to teach people who were just behind me if somebody's even one step behind me and one thing I'm qualified to teach and I know this because of my years from 2011 all the way to 2014 from teaching chess to people so when I started coaching people in coding and I started mentoring and tutoring I was making thirty five to fifty dollars an hour and once I was able to do that well what happened was I just crossed out chess remember it's just as important what you're not doing as it is what you are doing so I actually just kibosh the chest completely right because if this is true then I want to be spending all of my time coding because it's worth ten times or a hundred times more in the long run right so I started earning all my income from teaching people coding and you know again I'm spending 18 hours 16 hours a day so my 3 months 4 months will probably be somebody's years and years and years because I also never let off the gas most people and I spent two years on something it's like to spend a few hours a week and then they like skip in the middle and to fall off and then they'll like spend but if you just spend time on it like a maniac a big chunk and that's all you dream about sleep about talk about Saul you do then you think again you you grow exponentially so once I started making 35 to 50 dollars an hour from teaching coding well I was learning this new $500 an hour skill set in the long scheme of things right and in the 10year term thinking and I thought I should be paying for this time from my own pocket yet I was actually getting paid for it that was the most unbelievable thing and what that allowed me to do was now I was actually spending a hundred percent of my time coding all right I made it so that hundred percent of my time my working time was spent coding I mean I was so sleeping at some point but besides that all of my work was now coding it wasn't oh man I'm just trying to like hustle and you know I'm going to McDonalds man and I'm just trying to make the ends meet and then whatever time I have left when my energy is complete [ __ ] and I'm frustrated and I'm upset from doing this job that I know I shouldn't be doing and I come home and low energy speaking with my wife and my children and being frustrated with them and taking out my anger issues with them with that little energy that I have left the 30 minutes or 20 minutes of anger and frustration I try to work on my dreams with that I try to work on my coding with that that's what most people do and then they're frustrated they become overweight they become depressed they don't become good at anything and then it's a very very miserable life and instead what you want to do is you want to be you want to respect your [ __ ] dream it's your dream man you said it's your dream so then respect it the don't do the shitty job that you're doing right now like don't do the side hustle that you're doing right now like quit it and then start making income from this or start making income from this and then just quit that because you're spending your waking hours your most active hours your most alert hours on the thing that's not your dream so then you're not you're just not gonna have the life that you want that you're not designing the life to suit you in what it is that you want so you want to quit that a quick chess I quit whatever else I was doing I quit it I was trying to start a chess business I have a youtube channel called chess tastic I quit that and I just focused on coding and that's all I did then when my skill set so once I started coding with a hundred percent of my time and my I was now getting money from it well then what I kept doing was I kept realizing the following okay here's another hack that I realized this is pretty important to understand so pay attention so say I figured out how to charge thirty five to fifty dollars an hour to teach somebody coding because I had years and years 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 four or five years of experience freelancing negotiating prices I used that skillset to charge people 50 dollars an hour for coding well guess what on platforms like code mentor i/o and outside world there were developers who were saying that they would charge me $50 an hour for their time so now think about this I could trade now I had a new opportunity an unbelievable opportunity this is crazy blows my mind absolutely blows my mind okay now what I was presented with was with an opportunity to trade my three months of experience so I'll say like you know three months let me ask you this if I gave you if I said give me $1 and then I will give you $100 back is that a good trade for you probably is right so I got to trade my three of experience for some developer who had 10 years of experience now let's understand this this is not this is the same thing as flipping on eBay or flipping a home something in real estate it's literally the same exact thing I'm just flipping attention and time and money this is the time arbitrage I'm exchanging my three months of time for somebody's ten years of time this is a insane deal how many months are in ten years well that's 12 months a year so this is a hundred and twenty months okay so think about it I'm trading in my three months for a hundred and twenty months of experience that's insanity okay and what that allows me to do is quickly my my fourth month will actually give me like five months of experience you see what I'm saying because that tutor is now helping me accelerate to his level faster so if I spend so my fourth month will really be the equivalent of three months so it'll put me at six months the month after that would put me at like nine months follow so if I'm trading my time this is not a fifth shouldn't be fifty dollars an hour what I should be paying this guy or gal I was working with Jessamine Smith most of the times and then some other tutors two other mentors to encode mentor and other platforms but if I'm paying fifty well this is 10 20 30 40 times greater so I should really been paying 40 times more than $50 an hour I should be paying like my $50 an hour in this case should have been equal to what's 50 times times 40 well that's obviously two thousand so it should be two thousand or sorry the other way should be the other way so with this logic I should be paying them two thousand actually you know what I'm just gonna leave it like that so it's less confusing so the deal that I was actually getting was my fifty dollars for two thousand dollars in return that's the actual deal that I was getting here when I was having these people teach me because I will teach somebody coding I would make $50 then I would just come and have a session with them for $50 and so I kept zero dollars in my bank account but in the long run I knew I just putting two thousand into my bank account two thousand in my bank account over and over again because of the skill set I was learning and I knew that with my negotiation skills and all of that if I had their skill set I would easily be charging five to ten times more so this was the deal that I was getting this is a not an equal deal this is a very unfair deal and that's the deal that I was making I was exchanging $50 to get two thousand dollars worth of value every session that I had over them mentoring me and giving me their experience because in the start I'm not gonna be making money from it that's obvious to me but a year or two years from that time you bet then that that I would then be making 100 200 300 ollars an hour so it would take me about half a year to pay off all the money that I put into all of this stuff and then six months after that would just be all profit and then for the future an eternity it would just be all profit in 2015 I was able to make 80 K from coding from just teaching people coding and when I had other developers teaching me I was improving my skill set really really fast and I was also learning on my own too obviously because I was super interested so you know I probably invested like 20k or something like that into my own learning 20k or more 20k plus into my own learning online courses coding courses and then mentors suspend this but then I made a lot so not a bad deal and primarily by teaching coding then if you fast forward to 2016 well then I got so good at that point that I picked up the skill of freelancing and so I made most of my money from teaching people coding about 70 to 80 K and then I picked up another 20 or 30 K from freelancing so I made about a hundred four thousand dollars in 2016 and that added twenty thirty K extra from this is from freelancing okay and then I got pretty good at freelancing because I understood how it worked and then I'm like okay next year I would crush it even more but then I thought but then around this time people were asking a lot of questions how did improve so fast how to get here so fast my own teacher from my computer science class started asking me hey how did you improve your skills so fast how did you do this and he started asking me for a career advice and that's when I thought ok maybe it's a good time to not code anymore and actually teach people and help them with their own careers and that's why I started the YouTube channel and then what happened in 2017 through 2019 is all just helping developers that's all I so again it's important what I'm not doing what you have to understand when I started 2017 I actually gave up all of my clients I was making about $10,000 a month and I just cut them all I cut all of my clients I got an office so I could have actually more expenses to deal with because I just knew I had to put myself against the wall and not give myself any chances out I also didn't have any money saved up I used up all my money to reinvest into my own self to learn the skills that I needed to learn and then 2017 I just was I thought yeah I don't want to I just want to improve my business and I'm gonna force myself to make all the income for my business clever programmer and then 2017 2018 2019 that was the only focus so 2014 pretty much 2016 only one focus coding nothing else code improve the skill set that's it time arbitrage you know 100 percent time spent coding these are the people people are not doing that's why it takes them 20 years to get the same results you know the only way they can get the same results if there have a job at Google or Facebook and you don't need that [ __ ] like if you understand these principles you know I was reading lots of books so I didn't mention that but audible was really helpful for me and I was listening to Rich Dad & Poor Dad I listened to John Sandra's book soft skills that had a huge impact on my life and 10x by Grant Cardone and just lots of books that hearing them and reading them helped change my life and change the way I thought completely then once my thoughts changed then my actions followed and then after my actions followed the results came for a while right each of them is a thought is a leading indicator and then everything else is a lagging indicator you know what is the leading and lagging me you keep working out for a long time the act of working out is a leading indicator and then the body changing is a lagging indicator so thoughts are the leading indicator once your thought starts to change well then that's the leading indicator once that happens the lagging indicators are that your actions start to change and then even more of a lagging indicator after that are the results then results start to come up after a while but all of the things that are really beneficial for you have very slow longterm impacts and they're there there's only long term gratification there's no instant gratification which is why most people aren't good at it because humans are designed for instant gratification and most people focus on just instant gratification and if you do that well you're not going to get most things that are amazing for you like your body transforming into the body of your dreams longterm your relationship turning into the relationship of your dreams longterm your business turning into the business you want longterm okay this is a very long term I mean this might seem very small to you but this is a six year one two three four five six it's about six years long transformation and progression I went from being really weak and skinny I transformed a lot of my own body I mean I was scrawny weak kid who couldn't do anything and I transformed my body a lot in this time I transformed my social skills a lot in this time I learned how to socialize I learned how to have girlfriends I learned how to become a better developer I learned how to become a better businessman I learned how to become a better a copywriter a better video editor a better storyteller a better content creator you know a better programmer a better developer a better friend Lance or better at managing people better at building culture better at reading books so all of these skills that start to stack up you know my whole life just was designed around that and I sacrificed a lot of things but then it just made me better and now I've I have you know I'm still not where I need to be but I feel like I have an amazing relationship I am currently working on my body goals and being a lot more consistent consistency is one of my weaknesses so I'm working on that and I'm asking for help a lot and then I'm just focusing on my business and improving that and this is a longterm game right most people give up and you just keep going so learn coding business okay six year long transformation takes a long time it's really hard it requires you to really enjoy it but if you start focusing and feeding your brain the right things then you're gonna be on the right track so you got to get out of your comfort zone and you have to you know the reason why I develop social skills was so I could be better at confrontations why should I be better at confrontations well whenever you're having a discussion or on negotiation most people are just [ __ ] and they want to get they don't understand that they could spend either ten years coding and building more experience to ask for a raise or just withstand the pressure and the awkwardness in the 20 minute meeting to negotiate a higher rate most people don't understand that and those 20 minutes can give you 10 years of results so while hustle is very important if you're not very strategic and you're not thinking well then you're gonna screw yourself over in the long run right in that same negotiation you could be charging $30 an hour or you could be charging $60 an hour but it requires you to be a lot more confrontational it requires you to sit through the pressure and most people are soft they're weak through weakminded they're weak spirited they're fearful they're frightened so they don't want to stand out most developers is most developers so there's a high chance high probability that this describes you you're you know most developers are introverted and they just don't take the time to work on their weaknesses and I just don't think people understand that like it was very very very awkward difficult for me to work on my you know soft skills so I'm gonna write that here so a big thing that this is attributed to is soft skills all right now the word soft is here but don't let that trick you because it's actually very difficult to get these soft skills and soft skills attribute a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot of the success to almost every part of the success I attribute to this ok first of all I was freelancing since 2011 2010 that automatically helped me work on a lot of my soft skills but then what I realized was I could never charge more than 35 or 50 like $35 an hour until like 2013 or something and that's the time where I started having this really uncomfortable discussion with my boss and many times we had the discussion and then he actually told me that he would not allow me to increase to like $75 an hour and I even started making videos for him for the you know I'm like I have this idea the channel for this company is gonna be incredible and I'm not gonna say the name of the company because I respect them and they did give me an opportunity when I needed it so I'm like you know I have this idea like let me help make the videos chest videos for you you know the schools that I'm at it increased by like 40% 50% the amount of kids that are coming in so I know you're making a lot of good income on that and I'm just asking for a tiny fraction of it but I'll just keep improving my skill set I'll make videos for you guys I'll do more promotional stuff for you guys and after many different conversations he told me no and that was very uncomfortable that was hard I had to open myself up to rejection and then I didn't stop there I was like he can go [ __ ] himself and then I went and applied to other jobs and then I negotiated starting from 50 or $60 an hour and then I got those jobs and then once I got those jobs I told him hey I got two more jobs so I'm gonna be leaving this because I asked you to pay me more I deserve more I am more qualified I put in the work I put in the effort I have a lot of integrity honor and I showed up on time and did all the things that are supposed to do but you weren't paying me higher so I'm gonna leave and then he said no no no ok I'll pay you $60 so now I had three jobs paying me 50 to $60 an hour dad came from a lot of selfesteem a lot of pushing myself a lot of being uncomfortable doing the things that I didn't want to do having confrontations that I did not want to have that's not easy that's really hard that's harder than most other things because when people try to confront it literally feels like death to you if they're part of your body feels like you're gonna die so that other things I would do is like I would go to a Woodfield Mall and I would force myself to talk to people and I would go with my friend tenzin as well and we would force ourselves to talk to random strangers and have conversations and it was a group of five people or eight people or 10 people and just you probably listening to it or cringing right now and the amount of cringing you're doing right now tells me exactly what I need to know about your own soft skills because the more you're cringing right now it's more likely that your soft skills are actually weaker and you're more uncomfortable and so use this metric like imagine you were going to talk to strangers and if you're feeling some kind of like restriction that's exactly actually what's stopping you from doing a lot of things that require confrontation okay so we put ourselves through hell we would go to Woodfield Mall every day for 10 to 12 hours a day to talk to strangers because we knew we needed to work on our soft skills sometimes we would spend 12 hours not talk to a single stranger and we would be driving home and we would contemplate suicide like we would hate our [ __ ] lives we would be depressed that would come home and I would cry at times and so did my friend but we did it every day almost anyway to develop the muscle and skill set and then eventually we would just be talking to like random people and whether it was we were getting into a confrontation or just talking to them or told them to look nice or what whatever it was we would just do it and then we trained our muscle and brain to keep doing this and then I started having less and less of a problem asking for more because you only get what you asked for and you'll never get what you don't ask for it's just a simple rule of life like all the people who cry to me and they're like you know so great with my company and I did all the things and corporate screws you in corporate America just [ __ ] you like I spent 30 years and you know they never really saw the gem that I was and all this well it's your fault you should have asked for more good look but you know I didn't want to come off I have integrity there should have seen it no it's your fault you should have asked for more removed on same thing that happens to people in relationships they're like I don't do the other person doesn't see the gem that I am and the value that I bring and all of this is it treat me like [ __ ] and they abused me and all this it's your fault for being in the relationship I'm never on the side of the person who's the victim like sometimes maybe yeah like if you're being bullied and stuff and you have no choice sure look I understand how psychologically traumatizing it can be I grew up in a religious school where I got the [ __ ] beat out of me every single day it was like physical and mental torture for four years every single day in a row from the age of 9 to 13 I would come home with bruises at borderline broken elbows but I couldn't tell my parents because then I would get beat up even more so I mean I understand and I respect that but when you're in that situation where you have a shitty relationship we have a shitty boss it's your fault they're not shitty they were allowed to be shitty because of people who are sheeps right so this when I said soft skills it's not so soft you can't read one book and it'll change you this actually took years like 24 I did this in 20 14 15 16 17 18 like this was like five years long journey and then what did this help me with well what it helped me with was when I had to do a negotiation for $50 an hour for a freelancing client I negotiated them $200 an hour other things that helped me with I had a chest client who was I was gonna they were gonna pay me $60 an hour and I was like either you pay me $150 an hour because I have to drive pretty far or just we just won't do it they initially said yeah let's just not do it but then eventually a week later they came back and said okay we'll pay you $150 an hour and then they did it and they just paid me hundred fifty dollars an hour and that was it in 2017 2018 like when I had to charge for my course for a profitable programmer I had a knack little [ __ ] [ __ ] and charge $10 like most people do on udemy because they're making bad courses and they're scared they're also scared so they charge $10 or $5 I don't care about that I'm not scared I have the best course so then I will charge $500 for it and not feel bad and people will pay me and then we will give them the respect and integrity and everything to deserve and we will help them succeed to the best of our abilities and we have a lot of clients and customers for super incredibly happy satisfied and getting amazing results and then that's the thing right we'll do a great job but then we'll also charge for it and then it won't be charity and then it's just as simple as that and that's just how life works you just get what you like you literally just get what you asked for nobody has ever gotten stuff that didn't ask for every single person who's on YouTube and has patreon they're not asking for anything and that's precisely why they're also just barely surviving that's how most YouTube channels are working and while it makes them feel great and they don't have strong enough soft skills to charge what they're worth it's killing their overall business happiness it causes them to burn out they don't actually have a real business from it when it comes to freelancing most people don't have the soft skills to charge the price that they should be charging they're very very scared and so then you just always get the lower end of the stick in life when you don't demand excellence and you don't ask for bigger and better things relationships money health and all of that okay so soft skills is a very very very huge portion of it everybody has a different journey about how to actually go and do this but you actually have to do it you just have to put in the work books won't help you here you have to actually put it in action so there's that and then you know other other things soft skills help me with was when I started making deals with people to do affiliate partnerships with I was able to charge a lot of income for that okay affiliate partnerships are business partnerships okay that's what it helped with so yeah every every result like this one be 100k right now this would be 50k if I didn't have soft skills this wouldn't be 80k it would be about 40 or 30 so that's that's what it helped me with and if I didn't have those skills I wouldn't have this channel they also help me but like having confidence more confidence speaking to the camera speaking to people not having anxiety around it and then I know you know so this is up to 2014's it 16 I don't really want to get too much into 2017 to 2019 because I feel like that starts to get out of people's brains really quickly especially on this channel because I realized that most people on this channel just want to do coding but again I said I'm making this video for my older self and my older self would probably appreciate this information so I'm gonna share that so 2017 2019 it was all about growing the YouTube channel growing the audience around coding and and I think for somebody who's becoming a developer like it's a pretty good tract you should be documenting your coding journey to build a personal brand around coding I mean everybody's doing it now Joshua fluke you have like coding rice and you have like all kinds of random channels like everybody's doing it right Jarvis Johnson did it a simple programmer who was one of the og Zoran coding and building a personal brand around it traversée media you know like think about it like why is tech lead you know what why is he on on YouTube right he's working at Facebook so shouldn't he just like shut the [ __ ] up and work there and why he was also working at Google so why is he on you to what what is he doing on YouTube well because there's much more money to make on YouTube and there's much more attention that you get on YouTube that's why he's selling his course interview Pro or something like that with Joel my tech that's why Joma Tech is on YouTube he's also in San Francisco and doing well so why is he like think about it right why are people who are at the top doing this because well personal brand around becoming a developer is actually insanely profitable and it's a and then also it gives you limitless job opportunities so it's a good track to follow this you know increase your skill set and then build a brand around it like Stefan Mis joke is now doing it I mean just there's so many developers I mean it's almost like more developers are doing this now then then not you know that's YouTube is becoming the default and pretty soon everybody will catch on so it's a time for you to do it before everybody every single developer catches on you know life of Luba and then some other kid just started the other day yeah there's just too many they're getting out of control first night I mean Derek bat Manas is one of the oh geez New Boston was one of the oh geez and then everybody just jumped on the bandwagon including me and then we just you know we we grew our platforms and I'm yeah so you know 2016 a few months of it and 2017 it was like growing attention on YouTube and then selling a digital product you know growing attention on YouTube selling a digital product growing attention on YouTube selling a digital products it's pretty like linear straight forward I mean this year we did learn a lot about Facebook ads and YouTube ads and then we grew the business from that and now the focus is primarily just to help developers become developers and then go on a similar path like pretty soon if there's a demand for it I will also be docked like I can also be making courses or some kind of guidance on this path of 20 17 18 and 19 and then how I actually grew the business around it so quickly and then generated an income because sure everybody has a YouTube channel but like I have very difficult time believing that most developers on that have a youtube channel or generating in this amount of range maybe but you need a real business not you know you need a real business where you have real customers who are actually satisfied clients okay you can't grow to this from YouTube ads that would be really hard really really really hard so yeah I mean that's the trajectory of the personal brand this is how it was built I think it's pretty good model for developers to follow you can't really go wrong and the skills that are permanent and I always want my skills to be permanent like for example if coding dies is a year from now or two years from now it really wouldn't matter to mean that much because I have the skill set of creating content I have the skill set of copywriting I have skill set of creating a product I have a skill set of selling a product of the skill set of having happy customers getting testimonials creating a team creating a culture like all of these skill sets and so if tomorrow clever programmer or you or something happens to YouTube or something happens to say the Z market of coding or Python or whatever it may be if there's a disaster tomorrow or the year after that whatever I have skill sets to then go into something else that I'm excited about tomorrow or going to another business so you always want to build your skill sets in a way that leaves you permanently flexible and permanently growing so there you have it that's how I made my first $1,000,000 in just the last two and a half years thank you so much for watching this is Kazi if you
