00:49 - of becoming a freelancer what's the best
00:51 - language to learn what is the most

00:56 - especially as we head into you know 2020
00:59 - and all the way to 2030 things are going
01:01 - to a I and lots of programming what are
01:04 - the job opportunities that exist and we
01:06 - cover all of that and much more so I

01:23 - today I've got a good friend of mine
01:24 - Kazi from clever programmer and he's
01:27 - putting on a special class a Python
01:30 - master class that it's really
01:32 - interesting and I wanted to just take a
01:34 - moment you guys thanks for checking this
01:36 - out it's gonna be totally worth your

01:46 - attention and stay to the end of this
01:48 - video because we've got some really
01:50 - valuable information here especially if
01:52 - you've ever wanted to become a Python
01:55 - developer if you've wanted to do
01:56 - freelancing work become a freelancer you
01:59 - know get out on your own and make a
02:01 - living for yourself without working for
02:03 - someone else or even if you just want to
02:04 - make some money on the side you know
02:06 - there's there's some huge earning
02:08 - potentials up to making like 300 bucks
02:11 - an hour
02:11 - as a freelance
02:12 - a Python developer and I've got the
02:14 - expert here Kazi who's done it all whose
02:17 - coach people doing this so so welcome
02:20 - Kazi hey thanks for having me John
02:22 - so so Kazi what what's what's going on
02:26 - man I wanted to I wanted to you know
02:29 - really when you're telling me about this
02:31 - I was I was pretty excited and I wanted
02:33 - to let everyone know about this but um
02:36 - you know I gotta ask you like you know
02:38 - I'm a c-sharp developer so why should
02:41 - why should people become Python
02:43 - developers I like c-sharp what's what's
02:45 - the why is it Python getting so damn
02:47 - popular right now absolutely man so
02:49 - python is the the feud there are a few
02:52 - amazing things that I love about Python
02:55 - and that are just true about Python in
02:58 - general so for example it's one of the
03:00 - easiest programming languages it's one
03:03 - of the fastest-growing programming
03:05 - languages so even as data science is
03:08 - growing and data analytics is growing by
03:10 - 2012 believe by 2030 forbes has
03:13 - predicted that you know 800 million jobs
03:17 - are gonna be given to AI so for example
03:21 - even lift right now has self-driving
03:22 - cars pretty soon uber is gonna have them
03:24 - and a lot of that is run off of Python
03:27 - even recently - early detected a black
03:30 - hole and took a picture of it that was
03:34 - done with pythons you know and Netflix
03:39 - just released an article a few days ago
03:41 - where they shared that every film every
03:44 - movie that you actually watch is being
03:47 - powered by Python in the backend so you
03:51 - know things like Instagram are built off
03:52 - of it YouTube is built off of it so it
03:56 - has so much potential and it's only
03:58 - growing so and that is why I prefer and
04:02 - just recommend wholeheartedly going
04:05 - Python okay okay some pretty good
04:07 - arguments and I guess that's you know
04:10 - it's interesting I see all that like the
04:12 - artificial intelligence stuff seems to
04:14 - be in Python like image recognition like
04:16 - pie image and all that stuff is so it
04:19 - makes a lot of sense that you know it
04:21 - seems like a lot of the really the AI
04:24 - and machine learning in all of
04:26 - his his Python and that's that's where
04:29 - we're going in the future but well what
04:31 - about free beginner see that's the thing
04:32 - is like you know if someone's getting
04:34 - started in software development is is
04:37 - Python the easy is it an easy language
04:40 - for them to learn yeah so perfect python
04:44 - is at one of the easiest programming
04:46 - languages to learn and if you look at
04:49 - all the universities right and you
04:51 - actually look at their statistics and
04:53 - data all of them are switching over from
04:55 - Java or any other programming language
04:58 - to Python so okay so you'll see like all
05:02 - these universities switching over to
05:03 - Python primarily because of how simple
05:05 - it is but it's not but you can't think
05:09 - it's so simple it's not that it's not
05:10 - powerful you know its deceptively simple
05:12 - but it's still powerful so people from
05:15 - again like Instagram to NASA scientists
05:18 - are using Python you know on their day
05:21 - to day base so if you're a complete
05:23 - beginner that's perfect you'll be able
05:25 - to pick it up really quickly and then
05:28 - the great thing about it is as a
05:29 - developer it allows you to be maximally
05:32 - productive so then actually you can just
05:34 - go on to get freelancing clients build
05:37 - projects as fast as possible and it lets
05:42 - you use all of the you know its
05:44 - batteries included so to speak so it
05:47 - lets you leverage all of its libraries
05:49 - and tools to build real-world projects
05:52 - really really fast that way you earn
05:54 - your income your client gets your
05:56 - results both parties are happy okay okay
05:59 - I see okay so that makes sense I mean if
06:01 - it's something that's easy to learn and
06:03 - then it has a very high potential you
06:06 - know down the road then it's a good path
06:08 - to be on especially now no what about
06:11 - freelancing right because I know this is
06:13 - one of the things that you're really
06:14 - gonna cover in this masterclass it's not
06:16 - just you know it's not just about
06:18 - learning to become a Python developer
06:20 - but it's also about you know becoming a
06:23 - freelancer and making money freelancing
06:26 - what you know why freelancing why not
06:28 - just get the regular job yep so that's a
06:31 - great question for me honestly it was I
06:34 - wanted to become a remote developer I
06:36 - wanted to do freelancing because I had
06:39 - to be when I was
06:40 - growing up and I used to live with my
06:43 - mom so I wanted to be able to be near my
06:45 - mom and help her a lot because she was
06:47 - oftentimes sick or my dad wouldn't be
06:49 - there and he was in Afghanistan you know
06:51 - as a military and he was doing
06:54 - translation so for me it was really
06:57 - important to be able to do something
07:00 - where I could be near my family and
07:01 - still earn an income and not be bounded
07:05 - by anything then I came to discover that
07:07 - there are a lot of other benefits like
07:08 - being able to work on my own hours right
07:12 - exactly yeah and be able to work with
07:15 - the type of clients that I actually
07:17 - enjoy working with and not necessarily
07:20 - have one boss I remember I read your
07:22 - book many years ago as the soft skills
07:26 - and you had you talked about this one
07:29 - concept which is which sticks to me till
07:31 - this day which is if you should look at
07:34 - a job like it's just one client right
07:37 - yeah exactly yeah it's one big client
07:40 - but it's still one client so your
07:44 - business in a sense is really weak if
07:46 - you look at yourself like a business so
07:49 - if you actually go to the freelancing
07:52 - route where you start to have multiple
07:54 - clients now you have a really really
07:56 - strong business you have freedom to
07:59 - choose your own hours you have freedom
08:01 - to choose who you work with you can
08:04 - travel and most importantly be around
08:07 - the people that you love so that's why I
08:09 - am such a big proponent of freelancing
08:12 - okay okay yeah yeah I agree with all of
08:15 - that you know I did freelancing for a
08:17 - while and you know I mean I was
08:19 - eventually able to build like $300 an
08:21 - hour as a freelancer and I thought that
08:23 - was just it was insane I couldn't
08:25 - believe that that was possible and I was
08:27 - working these regular jobs for such a
08:29 - long time but now I had this freedom and
08:31 - the heck I could work like if I wanted
08:33 - to twenty hours a week and make more
08:35 - money than then I was making when I was
08:37 - making working 40 hours a week yes yes
08:40 - so guys also I want to let you know like
08:42 - Kazi mentioned soft skills it's kind of
08:45 - interesting we have we just met up in LA
08:47 - for the first time about about a couple
08:50 - weeks ago and it was kind of cool to
08:52 - like see his story if you guys have been
08:54 - fall
08:54 - if not you know you should definitely
08:55 - check out his his stuff on clever
08:58 - programmer but he was telling me about
09:00 - how he first read soft skills and how
09:03 - that kind of really launched him in this
09:05 - direction and he's build up this awesome
09:07 - Empire you know a huge YouTube channel
09:09 - the awesome courses like doing
09:12 - everything right and building this
09:14 - business and like so it's just an
09:16 - example you know of what what can what
09:19 - can happen and so that's why that's why
09:20 - I also guy said I'm you know it's not
09:23 - just that that I'm that I'm trying to
09:26 - get you to sign up for this masterclass
09:28 - right because I think there's a huge
09:30 - benefit in it but also the thing is like
09:33 - this is someone that I trust right Kazi
09:35 - because he's implemented what I wrote in
09:38 - soft skills and he's made it work so
09:40 - he's actually taking the action and done
09:42 - that so I think he's just a great
09:43 - example of someone to to listen to and
09:46 - follow because he's actually done the
09:47 - steps right he's not just you know it's
09:49 - sometimes I think you guys think oh well
09:52 - you know some like John is just an
09:53 - outlier and it's you know anyone can do
09:56 - this if they're willing to take those
09:57 - steps so right there you go
10:00 - yeah I hundred percent agree I think
10:03 - ultimately it comes down to choices I
10:05 - think it's just as hard and just as
10:08 - equally easy working McDonald's versus
10:10 - charging 300 dollars as a Python
10:11 - consultant I think it's just as easy to
10:14 - work a minimum-wage job as it is to even
10:16 - start your own business so ultimately it
10:19 - comes down to what choices do you like
10:23 - what choices do you make right that's
10:25 - what defines your path in your direction
10:28 - like for example I could just pick up a
10:30 - can of soda and drink it right now or
10:32 - just as easily I could pick up water and
10:34 - drink it right in that time they're both
10:36 - really easy and like you know you and I
10:38 - were sitting in a lane you were like
10:39 - always think five years ahead if you
10:42 - think five years ahead where do you need
10:44 - to invest your time to get the maximum
10:46 - return and oftentimes it's actually not
10:49 - in doing the easy things it's right
10:51 - sometimes doing you know going after the
10:54 - harder thing so you know if you choose
10:57 - to go down this route of trying to
10:59 - become a freelancer sometimes initially
11:01 - it seems harder because oh man the job
11:05 - one client and I'm making
11:08 - decay 60 K maybe more but with freelance
11:12 - saying that might not be happening right
11:15 - in the start but if you actually decide
11:17 - to do this and I think the right way to
11:20 - do it is don't quit your job if your
11:22 - Avella per first replace your income
11:25 - like first either start generating side
11:27 - income or replace your income and now
11:30 - you have the choice to quit your job but
11:33 - and the end what you'll have is freedom
11:36 - and I think that is what's truly
11:37 - priceless right and even if someone
11:39 - didn't want to like you know if
11:41 - someone's listening in there they're
11:43 - happy they like their developer job
11:45 - right but maybe they want to make some
11:47 - extra income on the side or maybe they
11:49 - just want to work on projects that are
11:50 - fun right that was one of the things
11:51 - like I think that pulled me into doing
11:53 - some freelancing is like yeah I like the
11:55 - corporate job and stuff but I want to
11:57 - work with this new cool technology right
11:59 - in fact I think one of the first
12:00 - freelancing things I did was I really
12:02 - like creating automation frameworks and
12:04 - doing iOS development and I couldn't
12:05 - really do that my job so you know that
12:08 - it's a good way to make some extra
12:09 - income and then you can kind of decide
12:11 - maybe you're making it not so much
12:12 - income from the freelancing which is
12:14 - what happened to me that you quit your
12:15 - job and then you just do that full time
12:17 - so maybe you don't even have it planned
12:18 - but hey you know keep making enough
12:20 - money to cover your mortgage every month
12:22 - that's it's like living for free that's
12:25 - right that's a great way to look at it
12:27 - you can yeah if you cover your expenses
12:28 - or your mortgage or your rent I think
12:32 - that is a great thing to be able to do
12:34 - with it too because then everything you
12:36 - make from your job is essentially close
12:38 - to pure profit cool cool okay well yeah
12:42 - we should talk a little bit about what's
12:43 - what's gonna be in the master class oh
12:45 - by the way guys I did want to tell you I
12:47 - just remembered when we went up to LA
12:49 - this guy Kazi he's he's a power lifter
12:52 - so you know not only is he you know
12:54 - super smart developer and and can teach
12:57 - you everything about freelancing but he
12:59 - lives life he lives the simple
13:00 - programmer he can also kick your ass you
13:07 - know I talk about lifestyle of not being
13:10 - the typical nerd I know a lot of you you
13:12 - follow me because that's that's you and
13:14 - you know Kazi Kazi is one of us so but
13:17 - let's talk about the master class so so
13:19 - why should people sign up for this what
13:20 - are you gonna give them in
13:22 - right you know I know so my god I don't
13:24 - really need to learn Python or I'm not
13:26 - sure if I wanna be a freelance developer
13:27 - but why should they you know just like
13:30 - stick around and just at least check out
13:31 - this master class so many reasons so
13:34 - many reasons first of all this class is
13:36 - just epic like it's just so entertaining
13:39 - to watch but more importantly if we look
13:43 - at the really valuable stuff that you
13:44 - get out of it is that it shows you your
13:46 - Python earning potential so even if you
13:49 - are just mildly curious about this right
13:53 - going into it and really knowing what
13:55 - type of realistically what type of
13:58 - earning potential you could have based
14:00 - on the number of clients based on a
14:02 - certain number of hours and I even give
14:05 - you a downloadable worksheet essentially
14:07 - which is plug and play so you can get
14:10 - your own sheet and see how much you're
14:13 - earning income potential is at which
14:15 - point you could look at it and go I
14:17 - think I want to pursue this or you could
14:19 - go I don't think I want to pursue this
14:21 - okay okay so definitely they should at
14:24 - least like in fact right now if you're
14:26 - watching go sign up now you can finish
14:28 - watching the video after you sign up but
14:30 - otherwise you're not gonna get this
14:31 - calculator and yeah you should
14:33 - definitely at least find that out right
14:35 - even if you don't watch anything else at
14:36 - least if you know what your potential is
14:38 - you owe that to yourself otherwise
14:40 - you're just you're just closing a door
14:42 - that's that's right and the most
14:44 - important thing I want to say about this
14:46 - entire masterclass it really paves the
14:48 - way and makes it super clear for you how
14:51 - to go from zero to becoming a six-figure
14:54 - developer now if you're already halfway
14:56 - there
14:56 - then the concepts are gonna be even
14:59 - easier for you to understand right it
15:01 - really creates a clear step-by-step
15:04 - roadmap and we give you a calculator
15:08 - that you can take away we give you a
15:11 - downloadable roadmap that is gonna be
15:15 - essentially yours and we give you a
15:18 - downloadable portfolio so worst case
15:20 - scenario you leave with the portfolio
15:22 - that can potentially help you land jobs
15:24 - this is a tested and proven portfolio
15:27 - you get a road map that you can use so
15:30 - even if you just come out of curiosity
15:32 - to download these things I believe that
15:35 - you're still
15:35 - gonna find a lot of value in this right
15:38 - exactly and this master Gus is totally
15:40 - free right oh yeah it's totally free
15:42 - that's right okay so yeah there's really
15:44 - no reason to not not check this out
15:46 - so so yeah so guys definitely you know
15:49 - click sign up make sure before you miss
15:51 - this opportunity because I don't know if
15:53 - this is gonna be offered again and I
15:55 - know there's some huge value here so
15:57 - what else what other kind of surprises
15:59 - the bonus you said it's entertaining was
16:01 - it entertaining so it's I mean it's shot
16:04 - it's really high-quality it was made
16:06 - with a lot of love and passion so just
16:09 - the quality of it is great and you will
16:11 - find a lot of you know there's some
16:13 - funny moments in it but most importantly
16:16 - I show you not just like the nerdy stuff
16:18 - to go from you know one point to another
16:22 - point but actually show you real world
16:25 - tangible projects that you can develop
16:27 - and for example I share with you my
16:30 - first twenty thousand dollar contract
16:32 - that I don't know is okay actually share
16:34 - with you the invoice I shared with you
16:37 - the exact first project I built to make
16:39 - my twenty thousand dollars I share with
16:42 - you how I charged one of my clients how
16:44 - I went from fifty dollars two hundred
16:46 - dollars an hour
16:48 - nice right so those are all really
16:50 - tangible things that you get out of
16:53 - watching this because I don't think a
16:55 - lot of people are sharing that I don't
16:58 - think a lot of people are sharing
16:59 - specifically the project that they built
17:01 - and specifically how much they got paid
17:03 - I also shared with you how you know
17:05 - within my first year I actually went
17:07 - from zero to making a hundred and four
17:09 - thousand dollars a year as a Python
17:11 - freelancer like complete beginner just
17:14 - actually started learning programming
17:16 - and I skipped a lot of steps because I
17:20 - had lots of mentors mm-hm
17:22 - and that's essentially what we want to
17:24 - be able to help you do as well like just

18:21 - would it mean for you if you made your
18:23 - first $1,000 from coding what would it
18:26 - mean for you if I reveal to you my step
18:28 - by step system that I use to go from
18:32 - being completely broke to then learning
18:35 - how to code in just a few months landing

Cleaned transcript:

hey this is Kazi from clever programmer today I have a very special announcement for you and you don't want to miss this video I have joined teams with simple programmer John somnus and we put together a video for you that is going to give you massive amounts of value but more importantly I have a masterclass for you that is going to teach you how to go from zero to actually becoming a sixfigure developer this is a brand new 2019 fresh master class that we've put together for you it's a threepart training series John and I are gonna be actually talking and having a interview that is going to be giving you lots of value and giving you insights on why you should actually become a Python developer why Python at all maybe you're a csharp developer what's the benefit of becoming a freelancer what's the best language to learn what is the most popular language and the most growing especially as we head into you know 2020 and all the way to 2030 things are going to a I and lots of programming what are the job opportunities that exist and we cover all of that and much more so I think you're really gonna enjoy this video just sit back relax and let's roll the video and I wanted to tell you about a very special opportunity that I have today I've got a good friend of mine Kazi from clever programmer and he's putting on a special class a Python master class that it's really interesting and I wanted to just take a moment you guys thanks for checking this out it's gonna be totally worth your time I gotta tell you right now though you know turn off all of your cell phones er your notifications distractions all that stuff because you're gonna want to really pay attention and stay to the end of this video because we've got some really valuable information here especially if you've ever wanted to become a Python developer if you've wanted to do freelancing work become a freelancer you know get out on your own and make a living for yourself without working for someone else or even if you just want to make some money on the side you know there's there's some huge earning potentials up to making like 300 bucks an hour as a freelance a Python developer and I've got the expert here Kazi who's done it all whose coach people doing this so so welcome Kazi hey thanks for having me John so so Kazi what what's what's going on man I wanted to I wanted to you know really when you're telling me about this I was I was pretty excited and I wanted to let everyone know about this but um you know I gotta ask you like you know I'm a csharp developer so why should why should people become Python developers I like csharp what's what's the why is it Python getting so damn popular right now absolutely man so python is the the feud there are a few amazing things that I love about Python and that are just true about Python in general so for example it's one of the easiest programming languages it's one of the fastestgrowing programming languages so even as data science is growing and data analytics is growing by 2012 believe by 2030 forbes has predicted that you know 800 million jobs are gonna be given to AI so for example even lift right now has selfdriving cars pretty soon uber is gonna have them and a lot of that is run off of Python even recently early detected a black hole and took a picture of it that was done with pythons you know and Netflix just released an article a few days ago where they shared that every film every movie that you actually watch is being powered by Python in the backend so you know things like Instagram are built off of it YouTube is built off of it so it has so much potential and it's only growing so and that is why I prefer and just recommend wholeheartedly going Python okay okay some pretty good arguments and I guess that's you know it's interesting I see all that like the artificial intelligence stuff seems to be in Python like image recognition like pie image and all that stuff is so it makes a lot of sense that you know it seems like a lot of the really the AI and machine learning in all of his his Python and that's that's where we're going in the future but well what about free beginner see that's the thing is like you know if someone's getting started in software development is is Python the easy is it an easy language for them to learn yeah so perfect python is at one of the easiest programming languages to learn and if you look at all the universities right and you actually look at their statistics and data all of them are switching over from Java or any other programming language to Python so okay so you'll see like all these universities switching over to Python primarily because of how simple it is but it's not but you can't think it's so simple it's not that it's not powerful you know its deceptively simple but it's still powerful so people from again like Instagram to NASA scientists are using Python you know on their day to day base so if you're a complete beginner that's perfect you'll be able to pick it up really quickly and then the great thing about it is as a developer it allows you to be maximally productive so then actually you can just go on to get freelancing clients build projects as fast as possible and it lets you use all of the you know its batteries included so to speak so it lets you leverage all of its libraries and tools to build realworld projects really really fast that way you earn your income your client gets your results both parties are happy okay okay I see okay so that makes sense I mean if it's something that's easy to learn and then it has a very high potential you know down the road then it's a good path to be on especially now no what about freelancing right because I know this is one of the things that you're really gonna cover in this masterclass it's not just you know it's not just about learning to become a Python developer but it's also about you know becoming a freelancer and making money freelancing what you know why freelancing why not just get the regular job yep so that's a great question for me honestly it was I wanted to become a remote developer I wanted to do freelancing because I had to be when I was growing up and I used to live with my mom so I wanted to be able to be near my mom and help her a lot because she was oftentimes sick or my dad wouldn't be there and he was in Afghanistan you know as a military and he was doing translation so for me it was really important to be able to do something where I could be near my family and still earn an income and not be bounded by anything then I came to discover that there are a lot of other benefits like being able to work on my own hours right exactly yeah and be able to work with the type of clients that I actually enjoy working with and not necessarily have one boss I remember I read your book many years ago as the soft skills and you had you talked about this one concept which is which sticks to me till this day which is if you should look at a job like it's just one client right yeah exactly yeah it's one big client but it's still one client so your business in a sense is really weak if you look at yourself like a business so if you actually go to the freelancing route where you start to have multiple clients now you have a really really strong business you have freedom to choose your own hours you have freedom to choose who you work with you can travel and most importantly be around the people that you love so that's why I am such a big proponent of freelancing okay okay yeah yeah I agree with all of that you know I did freelancing for a while and you know I mean I was eventually able to build like $300 an hour as a freelancer and I thought that was just it was insane I couldn't believe that that was possible and I was working these regular jobs for such a long time but now I had this freedom and the heck I could work like if I wanted to twenty hours a week and make more money than then I was making when I was making working 40 hours a week yes yes so guys also I want to let you know like Kazi mentioned soft skills it's kind of interesting we have we just met up in LA for the first time about about a couple weeks ago and it was kind of cool to like see his story if you guys have been fall if not you know you should definitely check out his his stuff on clever programmer but he was telling me about how he first read soft skills and how that kind of really launched him in this direction and he's build up this awesome Empire you know a huge YouTube channel the awesome courses like doing everything right and building this business and like so it's just an example you know of what what can what can happen and so that's why that's why I also guy said I'm you know it's not just that that I'm that I'm trying to get you to sign up for this masterclass right because I think there's a huge benefit in it but also the thing is like this is someone that I trust right Kazi because he's implemented what I wrote in soft skills and he's made it work so he's actually taking the action and done that so I think he's just a great example of someone to to listen to and follow because he's actually done the steps right he's not just you know it's sometimes I think you guys think oh well you know some like John is just an outlier and it's you know anyone can do this if they're willing to take those steps so right there you go yeah I hundred percent agree I think ultimately it comes down to choices I think it's just as hard and just as equally easy working McDonald's versus charging 300 dollars as a Python consultant I think it's just as easy to work a minimumwage job as it is to even start your own business so ultimately it comes down to what choices do you like what choices do you make right that's what defines your path in your direction like for example I could just pick up a can of soda and drink it right now or just as easily I could pick up water and drink it right in that time they're both really easy and like you know you and I were sitting in a lane you were like always think five years ahead if you think five years ahead where do you need to invest your time to get the maximum return and oftentimes it's actually not in doing the easy things it's right sometimes doing you know going after the harder thing so you know if you choose to go down this route of trying to become a freelancer sometimes initially it seems harder because oh man the job one client and I'm making decay 60 K maybe more but with freelance saying that might not be happening right in the start but if you actually decide to do this and I think the right way to do it is don't quit your job if your Avella per first replace your income like first either start generating side income or replace your income and now you have the choice to quit your job but and the end what you'll have is freedom and I think that is what's truly priceless right and even if someone didn't want to like you know if someone's listening in there they're happy they like their developer job right but maybe they want to make some extra income on the side or maybe they just want to work on projects that are fun right that was one of the things like I think that pulled me into doing some freelancing is like yeah I like the corporate job and stuff but I want to work with this new cool technology right in fact I think one of the first freelancing things I did was I really like creating automation frameworks and doing iOS development and I couldn't really do that my job so you know that it's a good way to make some extra income and then you can kind of decide maybe you're making it not so much income from the freelancing which is what happened to me that you quit your job and then you just do that full time so maybe you don't even have it planned but hey you know keep making enough money to cover your mortgage every month that's it's like living for free that's right that's a great way to look at it you can yeah if you cover your expenses or your mortgage or your rent I think that is a great thing to be able to do with it too because then everything you make from your job is essentially close to pure profit cool cool okay well yeah we should talk a little bit about what's what's gonna be in the master class oh by the way guys I did want to tell you I just remembered when we went up to LA this guy Kazi he's he's a power lifter so you know not only is he you know super smart developer and and can teach you everything about freelancing but he lives life he lives the simple programmer he can also kick your ass you know I talk about lifestyle of not being the typical nerd I know a lot of you you follow me because that's that's you and you know Kazi Kazi is one of us so but let's talk about the master class so so why should people sign up for this what are you gonna give them in right you know I know so my god I don't really need to learn Python or I'm not sure if I wanna be a freelance developer but why should they you know just like stick around and just at least check out this master class so many reasons so many reasons first of all this class is just epic like it's just so entertaining to watch but more importantly if we look at the really valuable stuff that you get out of it is that it shows you your Python earning potential so even if you are just mildly curious about this right going into it and really knowing what type of realistically what type of earning potential you could have based on the number of clients based on a certain number of hours and I even give you a downloadable worksheet essentially which is plug and play so you can get your own sheet and see how much you're earning income potential is at which point you could look at it and go I think I want to pursue this or you could go I don't think I want to pursue this okay okay so definitely they should at least like in fact right now if you're watching go sign up now you can finish watching the video after you sign up but otherwise you're not gonna get this calculator and yeah you should definitely at least find that out right even if you don't watch anything else at least if you know what your potential is you owe that to yourself otherwise you're just you're just closing a door that's that's right and the most important thing I want to say about this entire masterclass it really paves the way and makes it super clear for you how to go from zero to becoming a sixfigure developer now if you're already halfway there then the concepts are gonna be even easier for you to understand right it really creates a clear stepbystep roadmap and we give you a calculator that you can take away we give you a downloadable roadmap that is gonna be essentially yours and we give you a downloadable portfolio so worst case scenario you leave with the portfolio that can potentially help you land jobs this is a tested and proven portfolio you get a road map that you can use so even if you just come out of curiosity to download these things I believe that you're still gonna find a lot of value in this right exactly and this master Gus is totally free right oh yeah it's totally free that's right okay so yeah there's really no reason to not not check this out so so yeah so guys definitely you know click sign up make sure before you miss this opportunity because I don't know if this is gonna be offered again and I know there's some huge value here so what else what other kind of surprises the bonus you said it's entertaining was it entertaining so it's I mean it's shot it's really highquality it was made with a lot of love and passion so just the quality of it is great and you will find a lot of you know there's some funny moments in it but most importantly I show you not just like the nerdy stuff to go from you know one point to another point but actually show you real world tangible projects that you can develop and for example I share with you my first twenty thousand dollar contract that I don't know is okay actually share with you the invoice I shared with you the exact first project I built to make my twenty thousand dollars I share with you how I charged one of my clients how I went from fifty dollars two hundred dollars an hour nice right so those are all really tangible things that you get out of watching this because I don't think a lot of people are sharing that I don't think a lot of people are sharing specifically the project that they built and specifically how much they got paid I also shared with you how you know within my first year I actually went from zero to making a hundred and four thousand dollars a year as a Python freelancer like complete beginner just actually started learning programming and I skipped a lot of steps because I had lots of mentors mmhm and that's essentially what we want to be able to help you do as well like just give you all the tools so then it takes it takes away months and hopefully you know maybe even multiple months off your timeline to actually get to where you want to go awesome okay well awesome I'm I'm so let's do it awesome alright guys so make sure you sign up like I said you know this isn't going to be available for very much longer so you want to get while you can you know and and check it out it's a free class free my you know master class on Python you're gonna learn you know how how to become a freelance developer how to get started learning Python the the roadmap you know the calculator and in a lot of lot in the portfolio the valuable portfolio so go sign up right now and and we'll see you inside awesome love to see you inside guys please sign up and I'm really excited thanks for having me John yeah what would it mean for you if you made your first $1,000 from coding what would it mean for you if I reveal to you my step by step system that I use to go from being completely broke to then learning how to code in just a few months landing my contract as a freelancer with Python and being able to make twenty thousand dollars while I was a terrible Oakland Community College student and to then being able to live the lifestyle I want on my own terms and have the ability to have my own time freedom money and have the ability to make an impact on the world and at the same time travel with my friends be there for my family you know when we hit 300,000 subscribers go to all these events even now I'm in Miami 10x growth pawn with Grant Cardone how does that lifestyle come about as a Python developer I was able to create that lifestyle for myself and in this video I want to show you that how you can do that for yourself take students like for example John Navarro who went from working with me from complete zero to becoming a senior data scientists or nazar Molly who landed a hundred and thirty thousand dollar contract and now he has moved to Germany with his family and living an amazing life or a furry a sheikh who was able to make twenty thousand dollars after she took one of our programs I've put together incredible training for you they'll help you become a sixfigure developer so you can earn the income you want you can have the time money and the freedom and the impact that you want to have in this world the link is below click on the link they'll take you to the training just put in your email I'll send you this
