00:00 - hey guys what's up this is kazy from
00:03 - clever
00:04 - program.com um today I wanted to talk to
00:06 - you guys about
00:09 - college this is for college students
00:12 - this could be very very helpful to you
00:15 - and it could potentially save your grade
00:18 - save you from dropping out of University
00:21 - or save you from some really crazy stuff
00:25 - so let me share my experience with you I
00:29 - had had a tremendously tough last two
00:33 - weeks it had to do with a lot of family
00:36 - stuff that was going on and it had a
00:40 - tremendous impact on my college uh for
00:43 - those of you guys who don't know I am a
00:45 - full-time college student at the
00:47 - University of
00:49 - Illinois at the University of Chicago
00:53 - UIC
00:55 - um and essentially I was you know I kind
01:00 - of missed all the last two weeks so it
01:03 - had a lot of the big final projects and
01:06 - you know I ended up just getting zeros
01:07 - on those and it had some finals in there
01:10 - and I missed some of those and I was in
01:13 - a lot of trouble and I was pretty much
01:14 - at the point where I was like okay if I
01:16 - have to withdraw from the University or
01:18 - get an in you know um what's it called
01:21 - just
01:22 - withdraw that you know I I would kind of
01:25 - have to do that or or fail my courses
01:27 - and I was um I was beginning to accept
01:30 - that as a reality but then I discovered
01:33 - something pretty amazing and this is
01:36 - something I didn't know and maybe a lot
01:38 - of you guys don't know so I want to
01:40 - share this with you um even if you're
01:43 - not in college it's good if you know
01:45 - this because you can share it with
01:46 - somebody who does go to college this is
01:49 - something it's called
01:50 - incomplete okay so if you are a college
01:54 - student and you've had some crazy
01:57 - circumstances happen to you you can at
02:01 - the end of the semester sign up or fill
02:03 - out a form for incomplete uh some
02:06 - teachers will allow you to do that and
02:08 - what that essentially means is they will
02:10 - make a deal with you where they give you
02:12 - an extended amount of time to cover your
02:15 - material it could they give you up to a
02:18 - year but you could do it less than that
02:20 - you could do it the next day uh there is
02:23 - a little bit of a procedure but they'll
02:25 - help you out your counselor will help
02:26 - you out but it could potentially SA save
02:30 - you from a failing grade affecting your
02:32 - FAFSA or your financial aid affecting
02:35 - your next semester uh and a lot of
02:38 - people I know you know they once they
02:41 - think they're failing like me they won't
02:43 - even try to pursue and do something
02:44 - better they they they'll sometimes give
02:47 - up because of the
02:49 - bureaucratic system and you have to jump
02:52 - through a lot of Hoops and when I have
02:53 - to do that I'm just like whatever like
02:56 - sometimes when I get a ticket and
02:58 - there's so much stuff I have to do just
02:59 - to contest it I would just rather pay it
03:02 - off because I don't want to deal with
03:03 - the trouble of contesting it just like
03:05 - that I know a lot of college students
03:06 - who don't want to go through the hoops
03:09 - and so they just won't even do it but
03:11 - I'm telling you if you sign up for
03:13 - incomplete and a lot of teachers will
03:15 - let you do that it can save your grade
03:18 - if you are in some kind of trouble in
03:19 - the last few weeks or whatever okay so
03:21 - don't give up hope uh that's it guys uh
03:25 - just wanted to share a short important
