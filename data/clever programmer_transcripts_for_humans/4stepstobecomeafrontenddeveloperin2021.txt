With timestamps:

00:00 - now when you look at front end nowadays
00:02 - it's it has gone like a little bit more
00:04 - complex than it used to be
00:05 - there's a lot of things you guys have to
00:07 - kind of know about of course you have to
00:09 - know about html css
00:11 - a lot of our channel is pretty heavy on
00:13 - react as you guys will see
00:14 - you know and in this video we'll go
00:16 - deeper into it but this is just to kind
00:18 - of show you guys the overall road map
00:19 - we're going to be looking at when we're
00:20 - talking about front end
00:25 - all right guys so the three most
00:26 - important things guys when you're
00:28 - thinking about front end right you're
00:29 - thinking about the front end view right
00:31 - what you see on the website that
00:32 - includes what that includes html
00:35 - that includes css and that includes
00:37 - javascript
00:38 - and those three are the most important
00:40 - things that you guys need to learn
00:42 - as the base foundation for a front-end
00:45 - developer
00:46 - so guys check this out so stack overflow
00:47 - does surveys every single year on
00:49 - at hundreds of thousands of developers
00:51 - and javascript html
00:53 - css you know are literally always for
00:56 - the past few years have been at the top
00:58 - of the list
01:00 - [Music]
01:04 - what can you do with javascript first
01:06 - things is you can
01:07 - build web applications right so web
01:09 - applications include things like guys
01:10 - facebook that's a web app
01:12 - right we can build native apps i don't
01:14 - know if you know
01:15 - tesla the actual app for your ios and
01:17 - android is built
01:19 - with react which is insane right and you
01:22 - can also build
01:23 - server apps so server apps are your
01:25 - backend applications using node.js
01:27 - and those are very popular as well here
01:30 - are the top
01:30 - companies that are actually using
01:32 - javascript so what are these
01:34 - companies here we got facebook microsoft
01:36 - linkedin
01:37 - ebay groupon right tesla netflix google
01:41 - uber
01:42 - tinder airbnb paypal insane
01:45 - guys and half of them we already built
01:47 - clones for half of them already so
01:49 - oh yeah
01:53 - so now the most popular frameworks are
01:55 - which ones not
01:56 - we got angular obviously right then we
01:59 - also got
02:00 - view and then we got our favorite one
02:03 - quasi
02:04 - react hey
02:08 - yeah and i think you know what one as
02:10 - you can see from here right a lot of
02:12 - companies are using
02:13 - the all three frameworks are both very
02:15 - popular you got for example
02:17 - angularjs used by companies like the
02:19 - guardian upwork paypal
02:20 - sunny react gs airbnb instagram by
02:23 - ubereats and then ujs
02:25 - alibaba grammarly giblet and guys and
02:28 - so much more that's just the starting of
02:31 - it right
02:32 - which should you choose so when it comes
02:34 - to framework there's a big
02:36 - war between the most loved frameworks
02:38 - the most
02:39 - dreaded and the most wanted under the
02:42 - most wanted
02:43 - you will see my beautiful friend
02:45 - react.js
02:46 - is by far the most wanted
02:49 - angular is a little bit on the downward
02:51 - trend and the view
02:53 - is doing okay the reason for that you
02:56 - guys
02:56 - is angular is a lot more opinionated
03:00 - and it's a framework view is a framework
03:04 - react is actually just a library
03:07 - so it's pretty much like you're just
03:09 - using javascript so it's extremely
03:11 - lightweight
03:12 - and then it's super powerful which is
03:14 - why companies like instagram and
03:15 - facebook are using it
03:20 - so one of the big things guys in react
03:22 - is all about managing data
03:24 - that's you know that's what kind of sets
03:27 - react apart from a lot of these like
03:29 - framework frameworks and it's something
03:31 - called redux
03:32 - and it's a little bit hard to understand
03:34 - but we're going to go through it so
03:35 - let's go ahead to the next thing
03:37 - so redux context api that is when you
03:40 - were able to for example
03:41 - properly you know store data think of it
03:44 - as like
03:44 - you know data a local data of your
03:48 - on your application and then kind of use
03:50 - it throughout your whole app
03:52 - so whenever you change one thing for
03:54 - example on one side of the app
03:56 - right another thing will be able to
03:57 - change as well so it kind of
03:59 - talks in sync with each other as bruce
04:02 - buffer apparently says
04:03 - we have tons of live builds that we've
04:05 - put on youtube
04:06 - and you guys can check them out we
04:09 - actually did
04:10 - a zoom clone build we did spotify clone
04:13 - build with react
04:15 - we built tick-tock with react
04:19 - we built youtube clone with react we
04:21 - built tinder with react
04:23 - and we built a bunch of other things
04:25 - like netflix would react right over here
04:28 - and we built instagram with react and a
04:30 - real-time
04:31 - chat app for facebook messenger and just
04:34 - yesterday
04:35 - we built slack real-time chat app
04:38 - with react so guys if you
04:42 - are looking to learn and react you are
