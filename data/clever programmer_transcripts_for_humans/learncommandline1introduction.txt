00:00 - hey guys what's up this is kazy from
00:02 - clever
00:03 - program.com so the day has come
00:07 - unfortunately I've been trying to
00:09 - protect you guys from learning about
00:11 - this one thing for a long time now we've
00:14 - been doing our programming tutorials on
00:17 - python we've been making some other fun
00:19 - videos but you guys have to learn one of
00:22 - the most amazing things that you can
00:24 - learn in computer programming and
00:26 - actually one of the most important and
00:28 - fundamental things it's called the
00:32 - command line okay so you guys have to
00:35 - actually learn this no matter how much
00:38 - you try to avoid it so I have thought
00:43 - about and try to put together different
00:45 - ways of how you can learn it and I have
00:48 - found the best resource for you guys to
00:51 - learn this okay because I know this can
00:54 - be a little bit dry but once you start
00:58 - getting a little bit of hang of it it's
01:00 - probably the most fun thing because it
01:01 - gives you some magical powers you can
01:04 - essentially do things around your entire
01:07 - computer without leaving the keyboard
01:10 - and one window you can delete things you
01:13 - can download things you can distribute
01:15 - things throughout your entire computer
01:17 - you can have processes that can save
01:19 - things for you automatically you can run
01:21 - automated tasks like putting something
01:23 - into your computer and then it sends it
01:26 - to some other place automatically for
01:28 - you that You' have done so it does give
01:30 - you some tremendous power without it you
01:33 - actually won't even be able to do things
01:35 - like web development or software
01:37 - development so let's jump right into it
01:40 - and start learning about the command
01:42 - line so this resource you can see up at
01:44 - the top it's the link is this
01:47 - web.mit.edu
01:49 - blah blah blah I'll put that in the
01:51 - description below so you guys can go to
01:53 - it directly but let's just jump into it
01:56 - and start playing around with it okay so
01:59 - I do want you to play around with this
02:01 - game first and get a hang of it and then
02:03 - when you start actually learning the
02:05 - command line things will make a lot of
02:08 - sense and you will be kind of ready to
02:10 - go right from the start so okay let's
02:14 - see what kind of options it's giving us
02:16 - okay it says look at your surroundings
02:18 - with the command
02:19 - LS so the command LS in the Linux
02:22 - command line or whatever actually really
02:25 - stands you know I forget what it stands
02:27 - for but essentially it's for listing
02:29 - files or listing things so you get to
02:32 - see where you are okay so if you are
02:35 - currently in the directory like user SL
02:38 - whatever slazi and maybe you have
02:41 - documents or whatever around you LS is
02:43 - the way you actually look around okay so
02:46 - let's go ahead and type that in so I
02:49 - typed in LS and you can see it's showing
02:51 - me some different locations around me
02:54 - it's showing me this green land with the
02:57 - big building so what can can we do with
03:00 - this it says here are your locations
03:02 - Western Forest Northern Meadow MIT and
03:05 - then you have some items like welcome
03:08 - letter okay so what can we do to this
03:11 - what can we do with this information so
03:14 - to move to a new location you can do CD
03:17 - location so that's the equivalent of
03:20 - actually moving into a directory CD
03:22 - stands for change directory so let's
03:26 - change our directory okay so let's go
03:29 - into to maybe the Western Forest H I
03:32 - want to see what's there let's go CD
03:35 - Western forest and now in command line
03:38 - you don't actually have to complete the
03:39 - whole command if you're partway right
03:41 - with what you're trying to do you can
03:43 - just hit Tab and it will autocomplete it
03:45 - for you so I just did CD we and I just
03:50 - hit Tab and it autoc completed it for me
03:53 - another reason why I'm on this website
03:55 - is because if you have Windows you are
03:57 - going to run into some terminal and
03:58 - command line problem
04:00 - this avoids that so when you're learning
04:02 - it you're not being distracted by
04:04 - anything and then you can download
04:06 - something called git Bash that's git
04:10 - bash you can download that and then play
04:12 - around with the same command line that
04:14 - essentially the Linux or MacBooks or
04:18 - yuntu they offer you okay so let's keep
04:22 - going CD Western Forest so now I'm in
04:25 - the western Forest I don't see anything
04:28 - I'm kind of blind so every time I'm I
04:29 - move into a new location the first thing
04:31 - I should try to do is maybe look around
04:34 - right that's what you do when you enter
04:35 - a new room so let's do that let's hit LS
04:38 - again without even thinking I want to
04:40 - get into this directory H hit LS so
04:43 - you've moved into Western Forest you
04:45 - enter and travel deep into the forest
04:48 - eventually the path leads to a clearing
04:50 - with a large impressive building a sign
04:52 - on it reads spellcasting Academy the
04:56 - Elite School of
04:57 - magic all right so look around and we
05:00 - see some trees we see this big building
05:04 - in the back what what is that all about
05:06 - maybe I want to go explore that so here
05:10 - I have spellcasting Academy that's a
05:12 - location I can go to and I have some
05:14 - items sign and back sign hm how can I
05:17 - read these items okay so for example if
05:20 - I actually opened up my terminal right
05:22 - let's let's just do this live so let me
05:25 - open up my terminal no thank you I don't
05:27 - need any updates right now and uh you
05:30 - can see I have a lot of stuff around me
05:32 - right Anaconda applications Seine
05:34 - projects desktop and all this right so
05:38 - if I want to actually change into one of
05:40 - these directories I can do CD documents
05:43 - and that will take me to that directory
05:45 - but notice I don't see what files are in
05:48 - documents so to do that well what
05:50 - command can I actually hit to look
05:52 - around me if you've been following along
05:55 - so far you will know that the command is
05:56 - LS so I will do LS and hit enter and I
06:00 - can look around me I see Adobe I see
06:02 - chess tastic I see clever programmer I
06:04 - see the directory Final Cut Pro and to
06:07 - show you guys this in real life kind of
06:10 - what it looks like is let me open up my
06:12 - finder here and let me go to documents
06:15 - where is
06:18 - documents uh documents right there and
06:20 - you can see Adobe is the first one right
06:23 - and that we see that right there then we
06:25 - got chest tastic we see that clever
06:27 - programmer Final Cut Pro and you guys
06:29 - get the idea so we're actually changing
06:32 - directories changing things kind of
06:34 - right from within the
06:36 - terminal okay and then later I'll show
06:38 - you guys how to do things like run your
06:40 - python script right from the terminal
06:44 - but uh right now I'm just trying to get
06:45 - you guys the idea and make you guys
06:47 - comfortable with it okay so that's how
06:50 - LS is working right in your command line
06:52 - okay command line terminal I will be um
06:56 - interchangeably using these terms so
06:58 - don't get confused I'm essentially
07:01 - saying the same
07:02 - thing okay now how do I read something
07:06 - right so what if we have something to
07:07 - read like for example products export
07:10 - one that does not look like a directory
07:13 - that looks like a file so how would I
07:15 - read that well I think I can do less do
07:18 - products um export and hit numbers and
07:22 - uh yeah see it anyways so it is a binary
07:25 - file so it doesn't make sense to
07:26 - actually see it but you you can see that
07:29 - that if you do less it'll show you so
07:32 - less is essentially for showing you the
07:34 - contents of the file so if you had some
07:35 - txt file with some text in it you can
07:38 - actually take a peek in it without
07:40 - getting inside of it so if we want to
07:43 - look at our item sign and back signs
07:45 - perhaps we can use the less command so
07:47 - less sign hit tap to autocomplete don't
07:50 - type it all in because you will make a
07:53 - mistake or a typo and also cuz you're
07:55 - lazy and you don't want to type that
07:57 - much right uh I know I am so let's hit
07:59 - Les sign and we see this spellcasting
08:03 - Academy the elite sign the Elite School
08:05 - of magic today only free introductory
08:09 - lessons novice is welcome okay cool
08:12 - let's read about back
08:15 - sign if you ever want to go directly
08:17 - home just type CD with the squiggly or
08:21 - just play an old CD and you'll get back
08:24 - home getting back home might be more
08:27 - getting back might be more difficult
08:28 - though hm so let's
08:32 - see right now I'm in this Forest right
08:36 - but initially when we started we were in
08:39 - some other location where we could have
08:41 - gone to Western Forest right so right
08:42 - now we're into W Western Forest how can
08:44 - we go back well let's hit CD and let's
08:47 - see if it takes us back let's hit LS and
08:49 - we can see that we're back now let's do
08:51 - the same thing in our terminal so we
08:53 - make sure that what we're learning in
08:54 - this play environment is actually uh in
08:58 - tune with our actual environment in our
09:01 - computer so let's hit you can see that
09:04 - I'm in this directory documents this
09:07 - probably is not my home directory as a
09:09 - matter of fact it's not so let me hit CD
09:12 - and let's just go back to our home
09:13 - directory so anytime I'm lost and I'm
09:15 - too deep in some directory I can always
09:18 - hit CD and get back home okay so now if
09:22 - I look I'm back
09:24 - home all right well there's one more
09:27 - cool thing so at the top they introduced
09:30 - a command called PWD and that command
09:33 - shows you where you are so whenever you
09:35 - are lost and you want to know exactly
09:37 - what your location is what your address
09:39 - is you can hit PWD it's the equivalent
09:42 - of going onto Google and looking up
09:44 - where am I right now okay that's what
09:47 - your PW D is and how you read it is
09:50 - actually print working directory so if I
09:54 - open up my terminal again and I do PWD
09:56 - you can see it tells me I'm in/ users SL
09:59 - chest tastic well that's my home
10:01 - directory if I go back to documents hit
10:04 - tab um come here if I do PWD you can see
10:08 - it goes SL user slj tastic SL documents
10:12 - okay so maybe you guys are getting more
10:15 - of the idea so I wanted to introduce you
10:18 - guys with the ls command that's the one
10:21 - you always use like without even
10:23 - thinking I wanted to introduce you to
10:25 - the CD command the change directory
10:27 - command so you can actually move move
10:29 - back and forth leave a room and come
10:32 - back to a room and then I wanted to tell
10:34 - you PWD which is essentially where are
10:37 - you okay so that's it for this video and
10:40 - in the next video I'll show you guys how
10:42 - you can actually run your own scripts
10:44 - all right guys I'll see you there

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys what's up this is kazy from clever program.com so the day has come unfortunately I've been trying to protect you guys from learning about this one thing for a long time now we've been doing

Adobe I see chess tastic I see clever programmer I see the directory Final Cut Pro and to show you guys this in real life kind of what it looks like is let me open up my finder here and let me go to

hit Les sign and we see this spellcasting Academy the elite sign the Elite School of magic today only free introductory lessons novice is welcome okay cool let's read about back sign if you ever want to go directly home just type CD with the squiggly or just play an old CD and you'll get back home getting back home might be more getting back might be more difficult though hm so let's see right now I'm in this Forest right but initially when we started we were in some other location where we could have gone to Western Forest right so right now we're into W Western Forest how can we go back well let's hit CD and let's see if it takes us back let's hit LS and we can see that we're back now let's do the same thing in our terminal so we make sure that what we're learning in this play environment

what your address is you can hit PWD it's the equivalent of going onto Google and looking up where am I right now okay that's what your PW D is and how you read it is actually print working directory so if I open up my terminal again and I do PWD you can see it tells me I'm in/ users SL chest tastic well that's my home directory if I go back to documents hit tab um come here if I do PWD you can see it goes SL user slj tastic SL documents okay so maybe you guys are getting more of the idea so I wanted to introduce you guys with the ls command that's the one you always use like without even thinking I wanted to introduce you to the CD command the change directory command so you can actually move move back and forth leave a room and come back to a room and then I wanted to tell you PWD which is essentially where are you okay so that's it for this video and in the next video I'll show you guys how you can actually run your own scripts all right guys I'll see you there
