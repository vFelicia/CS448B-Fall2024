00:00 - I know it's not
00:03 - clickbait I just got off the phone with
00:06 - a senior engineer at Reddit has 15 years
00:09 - of experience and he just told me that
00:13 - they are not allowed to use Chad GPT at
00:15 - their
00:18 - company blew my mind too I
00:22 - know and he informed me that that's not
00:24 - just the case
00:26 - with Reddit that's the case with a lot
00:29 - of Fortune 500 companies a lot of the
00:31 - big tech companies you know what they're
00:32 - scared
00:33 - of their code being leaked rightfully
00:38 - so a lot of companies that's happening
00:40 - to or their code gets leaked it happened
00:43 - to Microsoft recently and a bunch of
00:45 - other companies where their code gets
00:47 - leaked and it's a big massive problem
00:49 - that they have to deal
00:52 - with but still there's something that
00:56 - seems so wrong and stupid with
00:59 - it that it's it's nuts when he told me
01:01 - that my mind blew up it's
01:05 - like in the early days when internet got
01:07 - started people were probably thinking oh
01:10 - we shouldn't get out this thing there's
01:12 - this thing called viruses and because we
01:15 - just do everything locally and we don't
01:16 - use internet we're good we don't have to
01:19 - worry about
01:20 - anything and then what happened those
01:23 - companies became dinosaurs and then a
01:25 - lot of those companies ended up dying or
01:27 - they weren't able to expand their
01:28 - business as quickly as all these other
01:29 - companies that could use internet so if
01:33 - you're one of these Fortune 500
01:34 - companies watching this video what is
01:36 - wrong with
01:39 - you
01:42 - Ai and things like Chad GPT or llms
01:45 - large language models all of these
01:47 - things that assist us humans in doing
01:50 - things faster better smarter and for
01:53 - cheaper doesn't it feel like you're
01:55 - putting your company in the stone
01:58 - ages that's what what it feels like to
02:00 - me it literally feels like if you are
02:02 - doing this and you're stuck doing this
02:03 - you're putting your company in stone
02:06 - ages because compare that to a
02:11 - team where they have the same number of
02:13 - employees as you so let's say you got a
02:15 - you got a 100 people on your team or a
02:17 - thousand people at your organization
02:19 - another company has a thousand people
02:21 - but your a thousand people are not
02:22 - allowed to use CH GPT so they're stuck
02:25 - with their human skills right the other
02:28 - team has a th000 people that are allowed
02:30 - to use Chad GPT I swear those thousand
02:33 - people will be operating like 10,000 or
02:35 - 15,000 people that's that that's what
02:37 - the
02:37 - equivalent would be if not more I know
02:41 - this because I hired a lot of software
02:44 - Developers for myself and I would pay
02:46 - them I don't know 20 to $60,000 per
02:49 - month cuz I had a team of developers and
02:51 - they were developing software for me and
02:54 - my company clever
02:55 - programmer and that's what I paid
02:58 - them and then Chad GPT came
03:00 - [Music]
03:02 - along
03:04 - and I was able to build the same app
03:07 - that I would have paid them 60 Grand
03:09 - over a 3-month period by myself alone in
03:15 - about 2030
03:16 - days so I did it three times as quickly
03:22 - and I saved $60,000 and that's just me
03:24 - as a one
03:27 - human imagine expand that out
03:31 - to thousands of people thousands of
03:34 - developers and you're talking about
03:37 - 600,000 $6 million $60 million saved or
03:42 - value produced however you want to look
03:44 - at
03:45 - it and that starts to be undeniable and
03:48 - so if you're a company that's doing this
03:50 - you're in the stone
03:51 - ages and for you developers who who
03:56 - watch this and you're like oh my God now
03:58 - I'm scared I should not use CH gbt
04:00 - because big companies don't allow it
04:03 - here's something crazy that happened so
04:05 - in my community for my course that I
04:07 - launched it's called profit with AI and
04:08 - Chad GPT where I show people how you can
04:11 - use Chad GPT AI make money with it uh I
04:14 - have a student in the community and he
04:18 - said the same thing is happening at his
04:20 - company they're not allowing to them to
04:22 - use Chad GPT so what he told us in our
04:25 - group chat and WhatsApp group that we
04:27 - have for the community he said
04:30 - what we do is we run to our
04:33 - car we brings bring our phones with
04:37 - us and we use Chad GPT in the car we
04:41 - solve our coding problems we figure out
04:44 - what the solution is and then we run
04:47 - back into the
04:49 - company and then we go ahead
04:52 - and uh solve the problem right write the
04:56 - code that way the company can't track
04:58 - that they use Chad
05:00 - GPT so a lot of these dinosaur people
05:03 - you know and then there's going to be
05:04 - elitist software developers as well that
05:06 - are going to be like don't use it it's
05:07 - because they're trying to gatekeep
05:09 - because they're scared shitless their
05:11 - little 60 years of experience is now
05:13 - being threatened
05:16 - and like I know it sounds insensitive if
05:20 - you are the person with six years of
05:21 - experience so I
05:24 - apologize but here's the thing okay let
05:26 - me say it with a lot of care and love I
05:28 - care about you and I want you to win and
05:30 - if you keep fighting it what's going to
05:32 - happen is you're going to get left in
05:33 - the past
05:35 - because that's what happened with
05:37 - anybody that
05:39 - fought technology or revolutions or
05:43 - changes they got
05:46 - overthrown they got killed their jobs
05:50 - got taken away their profit margins went
05:53 - away so please don't try to fight it use
05:56 - it it's your friend so what I would
05:58 - recommend to you
06:00 - is you you're in a great position if you
06:01 - have experience use that with AI and
06:04 - Chad GPT you'll go so much farther
06:06 - you'll become so much more valuable and
06:07 - instead of it replacing you you become a
06:11 - replaceable so please focus on that
06:13 - instead don't focus on I want to fight
06:16 - this technology and stop it from
06:18 - becoming a thing because you're not
06:19 - going to be able to do it and all these
06:21 - companies that are trying to do it or
06:24 - worried about their code leaking or
06:26 - whatnot just make your security better
06:29 - you know or get on I know you can't
06:32 - trust this company's taking so much data
06:34 - this company's taking so much data
06:36 - everything runs on data I'm thankful
06:38 - Google has my data so I don't have to
06:40 - type in my freaking address every single
06:41 - time I look at Coffee near me don't
06:44 - fight this revolution be a part of this
06:47 - start learning how to use AI start
06:50 - learning how to use chat GPT that's my
06:54 - personal recommendation to you if you're
06:55 - a developer boost up your
06:58 - skills
07:00 - you know there's so much that you could
07:02 - do I mean it's unbelievable I have
07:04 - students in my course right now who I
07:08 - have a 60-year-old who's like I tried so
07:10 - many ways of making apps and he goes now
07:13 - with Chad GPT I'm making these apps and
07:16 - I just made my first app in like 10 5 to
07:19 - 10 minutes and he's like I'm so excited
07:21 - I can't
07:23 - sleep and that's the experience I want
07:26 - you to have even if you're new to coding
07:29 - before I used to say the number one
07:30 - programming language was JavaScript now
07:33 - I'm going to make a video on this too
07:34 - the number one programming language is
07:37 - English or whatever your language of
07:39 - choices as long as you can articulate
07:42 - what you
07:44 - want you can turn it into reality it'll
07:47 - it'll turn it into reality and you still
07:50 - have to know coding and you still have
07:51 - to cons get the know the concepts
07:54 - because you C you won't even know where
07:56 - to copy paste it to run the code if you
07:58 - don't know know anything about coding
08:01 - you know I've gotten that question at
08:03 - one point I was somebody was like Hey KY
08:06 - where do I even paste this code to make
08:07 - it work and I'm like okay you're going
08:08 - to need to know a little bit of coding
08:10 - so you still need to know coding it's
08:12 - not like you just skip coding but what I
08:14 - mean is you have just sit there and
08:15 - write every single thing like now when I
08:19 - code I'm basically coding like a senior
08:23 - developer who has like 20 Junior
08:26 - developers and I'm just looking over
08:28 - their shoulder and giving them each
08:29 - tasks to do they bring it to me and I
08:31 - tell them if something's wrong with
08:32 - their code or not that's what I do with
08:34 - Chad GPT I just go give me a modal that
08:37 - has this button here give me a popover
08:40 - thing when you go on the tool tip give
08:42 - me this and this give me a cart that can
08:44 - when user clicks it it adds it to the
08:46 - cart and then user should be able to
08:47 - check it out so I give it all of those
08:49 - things that I know how to code but it
08:51 - take me 20 30 hours of my time and Chad
08:54 - JP does it and then I paste the code and
08:58 - I see an error and I'm like give it back
09:00 - and I'm like you know what you missed
09:01 - this add this and they'll you know and
09:03 - this and this and then we'll fix it and
09:05 - then it fixes it gives it back to me and
09:08 - I'm like this is good thank you and then
09:09 - I move on so I'm I'm operating like
09:13 - where I have 5 to 10 engineers and my
09:16 - staff Junior engineers and I can work
09:18 - with them now imagine when Chad gbt 5
09:20 - comes out or Chad gbt 6 comes out now
09:23 - you got senior Engineers pretty much
09:25 - right they they won't even make a
09:27 - mistake when you ask them what to do so
09:31 - use it build stuff with it if you want
09:32 - to learn how to use it and make money
09:36 - with it and build your own apps with it
09:38 - or land your dream job and make six
09:41 - figures or you want to make um you know
09:43 - you just want to improve your career
09:45 - whatever it is I built a course exactly
09:48 - on this and we're teaching you practical
09:50 - skills so if you're a
09:53 - theoretician watch somebody else's
09:55 - videos that nerds out on llms
09:59 - I want to use this technology to build
10:02 - real world that I can use that
10:06 - companies can pay me for that I can go
10:09 - and freelance with and that's the
10:11 - community that I'm building a practical
10:13 - Builders with AI and chat GPT so that's
10:16 - what the course is about if you're
10:18 - interested click the link below and go
10:20 - and join it I'm still building out more
10:23 - of this course so if you join it now
10:24 - it's in pre-order so you'll get the best
10:27 - price but the price will keep increasing
10:29 - and after this um Q4 meaning start of
10:33 - the next year the price will have
10:35 - increased almost by double the amount so
10:38 - if you're interested and you want to
10:39 - join or you're very you're even slightly
10:42 - curious click the link below go and
10:44 - check out the course called profit with
10:46 - the I chat GPT and I'm going to teach
10:49 - you the skills even if you're a beginner
10:51 - to learn Chad GPT to learn Ai and be
10:54 - able to even monetize in the first 8
10:56 - weeks and we have students doing just
11:00 - that so regardless of whether you join
11:03 - the course or
11:04 - not understand that chip is
11:09 - inevitable understand that AI is
11:11 - inevitable utilize it please use it so
11:14 - you become more valuable and you become
11:17 - Irreplaceable I love you let me know
11:21 - what you think like the video and I'll
11:23 - see you in the next video peace

Cleaned transcript:

I know it's not clickbait I just got off the phone with a senior engineer at Reddit has 15 years of experience and he just told me that they are not allowed to use Chad GPT at their company blew my mind too I know and he informed me that that's not just the case with Reddit that's the case with a lot of Fortune 500 companies a lot of the big tech companies you know what they're scared of their code being leaked rightfully so a lot of companies that's happening to or their code gets leaked it happened to Microsoft recently and a bunch of other companies where their code gets leaked and it's a big massive problem that they have to deal with but still there's something that seems so wrong and stupid with it that it's it's nuts when he told me that my mind blew up it's like in the early

as quickly as all these other companies that could use internet so if you're one of these Fortune 500 companies watching this video what is wrong with you Ai and things like Chad GPT or llms large language models all of these things that assist us humans in doing things faster better smarter and for cheaper doesn't it feel like you're putting your company in the stone ages that's what what it feels like to me it literally feels like if you are doing this and you're stuck doing this you're putting your company in stone ages because compare that to a team where they have the same number of
