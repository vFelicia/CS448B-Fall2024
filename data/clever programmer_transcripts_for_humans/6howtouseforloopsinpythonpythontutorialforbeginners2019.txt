00:00 - - Hey you, welcome to
learn Python programming
00:04 - for absolute beginners in 2019.
00:06 - In this video, we're
gonna be talking about
00:08 - how to use for loops with Python.
00:11 - Let's jump right into it.
00:13 - (bass thumping beat)
00:18 - - So basically, for loops,
the idea is you know exactly
00:23 - how many times you're gonna do something.
00:25 - Right now, first of all,
00:26 - let's start off by commenting
some of these stuff out.
00:30 - And, um, let's do-
00:33 - something like this.
00:34 - For i in range five,
00:37 - print i.
00:39 - 'Kay. And if a run this in the console,
00:42 - you'll see it'll print
zero, one, two, three, four.
00:45 - Okay? So it'll basically
start from the beginning,
00:49 - from zero go all the way to four.
00:51 - Because when you say
five, coding in Python,
00:55 - (stuttering)
00:56 - computer starts counting from zero.
00:58 - So if I said that ten here,
it'll go only up to nine.
01:02 - Okay?
01:04 - And, uh, that's the power of a for loop.
01:06 - We're telling it how many times to go.
01:08 - Now, what I can do is I can say
01:12 - for i
01:13 - in range ten,
01:15 - okay? Or I can say for count,
01:17 - and then I just have to change
this i here to count as well.
01:21 - I could say in range ten,
basically I'm saying,
01:24 - do something ten times, okay?
01:26 - That's all I'm saying here.
Do something ten times.
01:29 - What if wanna make a square ten times
01:31 - or what if I wanna make
a, a square two times?
01:34 - I can say two here, and
then run that function.
01:37 - Remove my print statement, like this.
01:40 - And hit Run, and then
result. It'll make a square,
01:43 - and then you can see it goes
01:45 - and makes another square immediately.
01:47 - So that's pretty cool. 'Kay?
01:49 - If I wanted to do it three times,
01:51 - I'll just do for count and
range three, do it three times.
01:55 - So let's see what happens.
01:58 - Holy shit, that's pretty cool, huh.
02:00 - Let's do it four times,
and let's see what we get.
02:03 - I mean, this is exciting.
02:07 - And I think in turtle
we can improve its uh,
02:09 - we can increase its speed, too.
02:12 - So, wow. We just made a window.
02:14 - Uh, let's go here.
02:16 - I think there's something called
turtle.speed or something.
02:19 - So, let's do, err, a speed one hundred.
02:23 - I don't know if that works.
There we go it worked, okay?
02:26 - Let's do a 50.
02:28 - Much faster.
02:29 - 30.
02:32 - Cool. I think if you keep it
at 15 that should be fine,
02:35 - 'coz that's pretty fast.
02:37 - But it still lets you
see what is going on.
02:40 - So now, we got, the turtle.
We've changed its speed,
02:44 - and because of a for loop,
we can make it do something
02:47 - however many times we want.
02:48 - So that's the cool thing about a for loop.
02:51 - Most of the times, you're
gonna be using a for loop.
02:54 - Alright? That makes things easier for you.
02:57 - If I wanted to do something more,
02:59 - again, I would use a for loop.
03:00 - So my question to you would be,
03:02 - what if you wanted to make,
you know, four squares
03:06 - or 10 squares, could you do that?
03:08 - Could you try and I
challenge you to do this.
03:11 - Could you try to make another
shape instead of a square?
03:15 - But have it be done a
different number of times.
03:19 - Uh-eight number of times, eight times.
03:21 - Alright? Give that a try.
03:23 - And I hope that's gonna
be exciting for you.
03:25 - So with that said, thank
you for watching this video.
03:28 - This was just a basic introduction
to how for loops work.
03:32 - With that said, please like
