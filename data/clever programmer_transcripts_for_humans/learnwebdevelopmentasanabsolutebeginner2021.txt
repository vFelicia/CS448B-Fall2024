02:32 - guys right now just pay attention
02:34 - to this live stream because if you do at
02:36 - the end of this live stream you're going
02:37 - to get out to the best roadmap that you
02:38 - can get as an absolute beginner
02:40 - to actually learn web development so get
02:43 - your phone out right now put it on do
02:45 - not disturb
02:46 - and turn it on back on when we're done
02:49 - with this presentation
02:51 - hell yeah so
02:54 - this is how we start do you want to
02:55 - explain a little bit about this amanov
02:58 - yeah so when you're starting with
03:00 - development you must have an
03:02 - end goal in mind because that's finally
03:05 - it right so when you're starting with a
03:06 - football match that's what we
03:08 - put this gif right over here why do you
03:10 - start to play football or you're
03:12 - starting with the match
03:13 - your end goal is just have more goals
03:17 - than the opposite
03:18 - team so this in web development or in
03:20 - your career
03:22 - as a web developer it's not you're
03:24 - competing against another person it's
03:26 - kind of like competing with yourself
03:29 - so when you're starting out have an end
03:31 - goal in mind
03:32 - like when i started i had a goal of
03:35 - creating
03:36 - a web application for my dad's education
03:40 - uh institute so it's kind of like still
03:44 - uh under creation so that was my end
03:46 - goal
03:47 - so i was thinking like when i started in
03:50 - april i would be able to create that
03:52 - application by november
03:53 - but the thing is it takes a lot of time
03:56 - and you must be dedicated and always
03:59 - just persevere be relentless just keep
04:01 - going
04:02 - but always have an end goal in mind you
04:03 - know that's a beautiful way to put it
04:06 - man
04:06 - end goals are really your destination so
04:09 - always keep it in mind and
04:10 - a good you know motivation or angle that
04:13 - you can
04:13 - actually look into make it tangible you
04:16 - know sometimes we got end goals that we
04:17 - never actually take into practice
04:19 - something that really does you know show
04:22 - how much practice you've had
04:24 - is and and it's not for i'm kind of
04:27 - generalizing here but obviously you know
04:28 - the amount of money that you can earn on
04:30 - a job
04:30 - really kind of objectifies the way that
04:33 - like your skill it makes your skill
04:34 - objective
04:35 - right so the better programmer you are
04:37 - the more you're going to earn
04:38 - so this is an example that we decided to
04:40 - just pull up
04:41 - out of indeed.com and it shows
04:44 - the actual front-end junior front-end
04:47 - developer
04:47 - salaries in the united states and it's
04:50 - actually higher than
04:51 - this in a lot of different um what's it
04:54 - called states like california is a
04:56 - little bit higher
04:56 - but overall in the country this is you
04:58 - know what you earn going in
05:00 - as a front-end developer a junior one
05:04 - exactly and also uh what when people see
05:07 - that
05:08 - name saying united states they think
05:10 - like okay so
05:12 - since it's in the united states you
05:13 - might not get paid
05:15 - as that much in countries like india
05:18 - or you know in uk
05:22 - or countries in africa like they might
05:24 - think that they might not get
05:26 - the same pay but the thing is with the
05:29 - current trends like with the kobe 19
05:32 - it's everything is remote work right so
05:34 - literally you can work for a u.s company
05:37 - from staying in india or staying in the
05:40 - africa
05:40 - africa you know like right now i'm in
05:43 - sri lanka and i'm working with clever
05:44 - program which is in the us
05:46 - right so that is possible guys so
05:50 - don't think that when it says it's
05:52 - united states it does not mean
05:54 - kind of like it's only based in the u.s
05:57 - but
05:57 - remote work also pays you the same
05:59 - amount of money you know
06:01 - man and also like when kazi says like
06:04 - it's money you know
06:07 - yeah yeah man i love that perspective
06:10 - that is so true
06:11 - and you know guys it is it is true the
06:13 - world is very global right now in this
06:15 - moment because
06:16 - tech is that advanced but even like
06:18 - amanda said right now you know the whole
06:20 - hovid thing happening
06:21 - everybody's working remotely we actually
06:23 - are going to have a student for one of
06:24 - our personal mentorships
06:26 - um to become a pro uh he wants to become
06:29 - a junior developer
06:30 - and we're going to help him just do that
06:31 - specifically you know he's going to work
06:33 - hand in hand with causing the whole
06:34 - clever programmer team and he is from
06:36 - east africa he's from east africa yeah
06:39 - that's awesome yeah yeah and it's
06:41 - amazing man so this kid was able to pay
06:43 - the mentorship and he's actually working
06:45 - for a firm in new york
06:47 - so it is very true we live in a time
06:49 - right now where you can actually get
06:50 - jobs anywhere and
06:52 - yeah amanath has actually been working
06:54 - with us for for quite a few months now
06:56 - and
06:57 - man this guy was giving so much value
06:58 - that it would be hard for us not to get
07:00 - him as a company as you know as a
07:02 - company and him working with us being
07:04 - part of the team and everything
07:05 - so that's just an example of how
07:07 - perseverance really does help you a lot
07:09 - in life and even
07:10 - dictates even more than where you're
07:11 - coming from so
07:13 - moving forward with this you know if you
07:15 - do want to become a an actual web
07:17 - developer or
07:18 - earn six figures with javascript we have
07:20 - one of the most amazing resources right
07:22 - there right now
07:23 - on the web and it is called profit with
07:25 - javascript and profit with javascript
07:26 - is of course where sunny
07:31 - being the main instructor of the course
07:33 - teach you just you know
07:35 - from the fundamentals to advanced
07:37 - javascript
07:38 - ultimately you know to help you build
07:39 - your portfolio help you build those
07:41 - skills
07:42 - because nobody can take those skills
07:43 - away from you and then
07:45 - land a job which would be pretty much i
07:47 - mean a lot of people's and
07:48 - go please people do not be spending the
07:50 - chat spamming it because
07:52 - i will have to block you let's keep it
07:55 - very clean here because
07:56 - everybody's trying to learn trying to
07:58 - bounce back ideas
07:59 - and get some great insights from this so
08:03 - moving on with this you want to explain
08:05 - this a little bit among us
08:07 - yeah exactly uh so
08:10 - to learn web development there are like
08:12 - you have to learn the foundation
08:14 - with the foundation there are stuff that
08:16 - you must know like the tools
08:18 - or it's kind of like the advance that
08:20 - you have
08:22 - for a developer so number one we have vs
08:25 - code
08:26 - so vs code is where you're going to be
08:28 - doing all the coding stuff
08:30 - so that is vs code and then we have git
08:33 - get is where you like store all your
08:37 - records it's kind of like a time machine
08:39 - and
08:40 - you can call it doctor strange of
08:41 - developers you know
08:43 - when you make a mistake when you make a
08:45 - mistake or you break your code
08:47 - git is there to save you like go back in
08:50 - time and
08:50 - you know that's what git does and then
08:54 - we have
08:54 - firebase which is really really powerful
08:57 - in like
08:58 - it allows you to do hosting it allows
09:00 - you you to have databases
09:02 - many uh no sql databases so
09:06 - it's really powerful and that's what
09:07 - we're using for almost every build that
09:09 - we're
09:10 - doing on youtube and then we have github
09:13 - github is an online code repo hosting
09:17 - repository
09:18 - that is like you upload your code that
09:20 - you're working
09:21 - locally on your computer online so you
09:24 - can collaborate
09:25 - with people from different parts of the
09:27 - world or even
09:28 - different parts of your company so that
09:31 - is github and then we have
09:32 - postman so postman is kind of like a
09:36 - back-end
09:37 - kind of like stuff that does uh uses
09:41 - uh what do you say uh it
09:45 - takes api calls and gets the data from
09:48 - the api so that's what postman does
09:50 - so suppose you're working with a weather
09:53 - app with react and you want to
09:55 - extract with the data what you do you
09:58 - use postman
09:59 - and extract all those data from an api
10:02 - so that
10:03 - that's what you use postman for so with
10:06 - all the basics like html css javascript
10:09 - react
10:10 - these are literally the really most
10:12 - important
10:14 - tools that you need to know as a
10:16 - developer definitely guys so don't sleep
10:19 - on them it's one of their one of the
10:20 - most used vs code being one of the most
10:22 - popular ids right now in the world
10:24 - firebase being a heavy heavy hitter
10:26 - right now in no sql databases
10:28 - and just you know non-server databases
10:31 - um
10:32 - postman is awesome to test out like ah
10:35 - monoth just said uh
10:36 - you know the api calls github now owned
10:39 - by microsoft is a huge
10:41 - git repository in git is the way that
10:44 - you
10:45 - version control the code so moving
10:48 - forward just going a little bit deeper
10:49 - into these specific tools
10:51 - you know one of the big tools that
10:52 - you're gonna have to use is an ide
10:54 - and id pretty much you know
10:57 - these are actual these actually are text
10:59 - editors most of them you know
11:01 - they're not really they're not really
11:02 - ides but
11:04 - the thing is nowadays we don't really
11:06 - need an ide you know we don't really
11:08 - need these huge clunky softwares like
11:10 - netbeans and
11:11 - eclipse and you know even even jet
11:14 - brains the
11:15 - what's it called huh
11:18 - it's called webstone
11:21 - and also pycharm and python too yeah
11:24 - exactly all of those are heavy heavy
11:26 - heavy bs code is so light
11:28 - it's no wonder it's also owned by
11:29 - microsoft so microsoft is not sleeping
11:31 - in the coding
11:32 - industry these guys are buying
11:33 - everything that they can it's actually
11:35 - developed by them
11:36 - so vs code is definitely what we use the
11:38 - most
11:39 - also like when people try to select this
11:42 - is kind of like really crazy
11:44 - because people always kind of find a way
11:47 - to bring kind of like an argument when
11:49 - you're selecting something like
11:50 - even when you're selecting react view
11:52 - angular you always have a fight
11:54 - you say one says react is better you
11:56 - once say angular is better
11:58 - once a view is better and that's kind of
12:00 - the same thing for this like people say
12:02 - no you need to have webstorm or you need
12:04 - to have
12:05 - pycharm it's not the thing guys the
12:08 - thing is you just have to start
12:10 - coding that's the most important thing
12:12 - so
12:14 - the most popular one being the vs code i
12:17 - think
12:17 - we can just all the other ideas or text
12:21 - editors are really great i don't
12:22 - disregard them
12:23 - like sublime text is really great like
12:25 - when you consider vim that's really
12:27 - powerful
12:28 - but the thing is you must settle down to
12:30 - one thing when you
12:31 - are starting at the beginning so when i
12:33 - say when you're beginning your
12:35 - journey as a developer vs code is the
12:38 - best
12:38 - and also there are things like you can
12:41 - add extensions and all this stuff to
12:42 - like power up
12:44 - your experience like you have tab nine
12:47 - that auto fills your coding and then
12:50 - have prettier that prettifies your code
12:52 - there's a lot of stuff that you can do
12:53 - with vs code
12:55 - that's not there in other text editors
12:58 - so
12:58 - if you're starting coding download bs
13:01 - code
13:02 - start coding yeah make it simple for
13:04 - yourself you know
13:05 - don't this is what people do you know
13:07 - they're trying to learn something
13:08 - and then they're like okay i need all of
13:09 - these tools now i have to master all of
13:11 - these tools then i'm going to become
13:12 - good at developing
13:14 - exactly and also like they all over
13:17 - complicate and
13:18 - think like you know i need to have a
13:20 - fancy computer
13:22 - you know i need to have all this fancy
13:23 - lighting i need to have all these fancy
13:26 - softwares to start developing
13:27 - that's not it and you have to check your
13:29 - mind because when you do that
13:31 - for developing then you do that for
13:32 - everything else then you start making
13:34 - excuses for everything
13:36 - exactly seriously yeah like when i began
13:39 - my journey i was like thinking wait
13:41 - i need to have a really powerful
13:43 - computer i need to really have something
13:45 - like this i need to have fancy
13:47 - keyboard and all this stuff but the real
13:49 - thing is you know it's not it's
13:51 - just you're finding yourself an excuse
13:54 - to just not do it you know
13:55 - you're logically kind of giving yourself
13:57 - an explanation or justification of
14:00 - why you cannot start doing you know
14:02 - start coding right now
14:03 - pretty much exactly and the reason i
14:05 - started in april it's kind of
14:07 - i i just really love to share this is
14:09 - like i saw an instagram post
14:11 - that literally said like if you don't
14:14 - come out
14:14 - of this quarantine or this lockdown
14:18 - without a new skill or without a side
14:20 - hustle started
14:21 - oh i've seen those i've seen those memes
14:26 - and just like motivational quotes and
14:27 - everything what they say is if you don't
14:30 - come out
14:31 - with a side hustle or a new skill you
14:33 - didn't lack
14:34 - time you lack discipline you know so
14:36 - that really hit me
14:38 - so hard that made me think okay
14:40 - seriously this is so true that we have a
14:42 - lot of time right now
14:44 - that we are not just finding excuses so
14:47 - that's
14:48 - what really motivated me to just start
14:51 - coding you know
14:52 - that's amazing man something that i see
14:55 - in you is like you are such a hard
14:56 - worker and also you're very
14:58 - focused so you do give a lot of good you
15:01 - know
15:01 - energy to your time and your focus so if
15:04 - you're doing something you're actually
15:05 - doing that
15:06 - and that's what i see a lot with people
15:07 - that just procrastinate a lot
15:09 - they always leave things for later and
15:12 - even if they're doing things right now
15:13 - they're not here now so
15:14 - that's really really bad and it's
15:16 - amazing the to see your growth man and
15:18 - soul mates growth in so
15:20 - little time and i think that can serve
15:22 - as inspiration so
15:24 - going back to the presentation here you
15:26 - know stop making excuses vs code
15:28 - download that start coding right now and
15:30 - also vs code is cool because it has a
15:32 - huge community
15:33 - and i actually forgot to mention this
15:36 - but we did get a donation

17:49 - bit more on the tools of visual studio
17:51 - code and everything
17:52 - but i think it's good you know giving
17:54 - you guys a little bit of context
17:56 - and also we are at 230 likes right now
17:59 - amanath

18:14 - just subscribe and also don't forget to
18:16 - share this video with
18:18 - your friends and family or people who
18:20 - might be thinking to start
18:21 - to learn coding because literally this
18:24 - is the best place you know
18:25 - to be yep yep make errors um find
18:28 - guidance
18:29 - and start to start so if you want to
18:31 - start what language should i learn
18:33 - first this is cool and we actually
18:36 - while we were working on this
18:37 - presentation and we really wanted to
18:38 - make it so that you guys
18:40 - are able to understand and pick up you
18:42 - know what what is the fundamentals what
18:44 - is the foundation of web development
18:46 - in general and what is it so
18:50 - the reason also i just want to say the
18:51 - reason that we're doing this video like
18:53 - there might be people who
18:54 - have already built all these clones and
18:56 - stuff i might be thinking why are we
18:58 - doing a really basic
18:59 - one today the reason is that we saw a
19:02 - lot of people who are coming
19:03 - without a basic knowledge trying to do
19:05 - the react clones and they don't find a
19:07 - lot of good guidance
19:09 - so that is the main reason that we are
19:11 - doing this video
19:12 - so if you have had troubles
19:15 - working on the clones this is the best
19:17 - video that you can
19:18 - watch and learn from this and start
19:21 - applying
19:22 - i'm working i'm putting in all those
19:24 - work okay guys
19:26 - so back to the slides
19:29 - so like if you were yeah sorry no mind
19:31 - took you off but if you want to learn
19:33 - the foundation
19:34 - that's the first step right that's where
19:36 - you start so that you can go into react
19:38 - and build those projects
19:39 - so this is what we want to dive into and
19:42 - the foundations pretty much
19:43 - are going to be html css and
19:46 - javascript now amanoth can you give them
19:49 - an example of how html works
19:51 - and what is all the exactly so html and
19:55 - css
19:56 - are not programming languages guys so
19:59 - they're just
19:59 - markup language and a style sheet not
20:02 - a programming language okay and also
20:05 - i've seen
20:06 - some of my students getting confused
20:07 - because the thing is when they start
20:09 - with html css
20:11 - it just goes really smooth and when they
20:13 - come to javascript and they say
20:15 - oh no i just learned html css it was so
20:18 - easy but when i started javascript it
20:20 - was really hard because yeah
20:22 - the thing is html css is pretty much
20:25 - nothing
20:26 - but javascript is programming language
20:28 - what it's kind of like
20:30 - you trying to talk to a computer and
20:32 - make him understand
20:33 - right so that is javascript and that's
20:35 - why it's
20:36 - harder than html and css yeah html
20:40 - is actually html and css are actually in
20:42 - my opinion very
20:44 - like human they're kind of very human
20:46 - languages to understand javascript is a
20:48 - little bit
20:50 - less it's not as bad as java you know or
20:53 - maybe c plus plus or something like that
20:55 - but it's way better than them
20:56 - exactly so this is an actual example of
20:59 - how
21:00 - html code looks and also the formatting
21:03 - and everything and how it actually looks
21:04 - on the websites
21:05 - so i know there's a bunch of movement
21:07 - going on there's a bunch of arrows
21:08 - pointing everywhere
21:09 - but tell us how this works so
21:13 - you can see the h2 is like the tag
21:16 - that we use in html so these are all
21:18 - tags
21:19 - and within them we type in the text this
21:21 - is uh
21:22 - if you can if you if you guys are really
21:24 - old and have seen
21:26 - really old websites like the old
21:27 - professor kind of website yeah
21:42 - now you're just bragging that you're
21:43 - that yeah that's that's cool yeah that's
21:45 - true it's like early 2000 websites were
21:47 - so simple they used like they kind of
21:48 - looked like this a lot of schools
21:50 - websites look like this that's why you
21:51 - know if you're
21:52 - if you're a student it's good to get
21:54 - your school as a client because
21:55 - normally their websites suck and that's
21:58 - what we've seen a lot
21:59 - right so right here um li pretty much
22:02 - just means
22:03 - list um i believe this is is this
22:06 - no this is just list
22:10 - on order list and this is how it
22:12 - actually manifests here so it shows the
22:14 - bullets
22:15 - i like apples i like apples oranges and
22:17 - then oranges
22:18 - and then if you do want to add an image
22:21 - you put image storage
22:22 - source which is pretty self-explanatory
22:24 - this is the url of the image
22:26 - and here's the image on the website this
22:28 - is the width
22:29 - it's kind of like just quoted up to me
22:32 - like i like apples oranges are just okay
22:34 - for me
22:35 - but my favorite is pineapple bro is that
22:38 - true
22:40 - maybe you made this bro who knows uh and
22:42 - by the way we got this
22:43 - from a cool youtube video which we were
22:46 - heavily based on you guys should check
22:47 - it out it has the same title but 2020
22:49 - and it's cool you know it's good to get
22:52 - um
22:52 - inspiration from different places i feel
22:54 - like that video really did explain
22:55 - things
22:56 - very well and so that's where i got this
22:58 - specific screenshot so shout out to them
23:00 - i don't remember who the
23:01 - actual creator is
23:04 - coda coder nice check them out thank you
23:07 - thank you so much for that
23:09 - so what about css
23:12 - so css it's the style sheet so what you
23:15 - do
23:16 - you have you create this button on html
23:18 - and you see it's
23:19 - really lame you don't have a lot of
23:21 - style on anything so what you do you use
23:23 - css you color it give it a border you
23:26 - give it a width you give it a height
23:28 - and you know it says it gives all the
23:30 - look and feel
23:31 - it's kind of like the makeup you know
23:33 - yep for your website so that's css
23:36 - yeah css is cool i remember one of my
23:38 - teachers in college
23:40 - um he spoke about css as being yeah the
23:43 - stylizing of the web
23:44 - but also the color also the shapes what
23:47 - you see visually so
23:49 - a website with html looks like this as
23:52 - you can see there's no color there's
23:53 - no sections there's no separations
23:55 - there's no effects there's
23:56 - nothing that's html css is
23:59 - where it actually becomes colorful and
24:02 - the way to do that
24:03 - is if you want to get a little bit more
24:05 - advanced into css obviously you know
24:07 - the foundations would be like we just
24:09 - explained here
24:10 - these three but going into the middle
24:12 - one css you know
24:13 - foundation i'm sorry um frameworks of
24:15 - that some of them could be
24:17 - you know css grids another one would be
24:20 - css flexbox another one would be
24:24 - actually bootstrap so here's the
24:26 - frameworks some of them are libraries as
24:27 - well
24:28 - but you know the cool thing about them
24:30 - is that for example if you're building a
24:32 - website
24:33 - and you're building just any modern
24:36 - responsive website
24:37 - most websites have very a lot of
24:39 - similarities and designs so you're gonna
24:41 - find
24:41 - whether that's big photos that have you
24:44 - know a
24:45 - slight show or anything like that maybe
24:47 - a video slideshow
24:49 - maybe just you know grids of
24:52 - actual items that they're selling things
24:54 - of the sort all of these things are
24:55 - already created for you right so
24:58 - in development i think if you're just
25:00 - starting out you have to understand that
25:01 - one of the biggest things for you
25:03 - is to become resourceful and looking for
25:05 - these type of libraries like css flexbox
25:07 - grids
25:08 - bootstrap material ui all of these is
25:12 - going to help you one become resourceful
25:14 - two learn how to use different tools and
25:16 - then three use
25:17 - things that people have already done so
25:19 - don't start don't quote from scratch
25:20 - guys that's
25:21 - really really big you want to mention
25:22 - something on this i wanna play
25:24 - yeah so it's kind of like you don't
25:27 - need to have a lot of code to become a
25:30 - better programmer you must be
25:32 - resourceful like
25:33 - i've seen people like you know no i
25:35 - don't need to use all this stuff i need
25:37 - to code all this stuff
25:38 - it just only takes time but it's really
25:43 - it's it can be also annoying like when
25:46 - you find a bug it's going to take a long
25:47 - time for you to
25:48 - do so when you're starting out you don't
25:50 - always need to do
25:52 - everything from scratch always be
25:55 - resourceful like
25:56 - css flexbox is really great also if you
25:59 - want to
25:59 - uh practice on flexbox go to
26:02 - flexboxfroggy.com
26:03 - so flexboxfroggy.com is kind of like an
26:06 - interactive game
26:08 - where you where it's 25 levels you can
26:10 - practice flexbox
26:12 - and also css grids it's
26:15 - kind of a is it like this
26:18 - xbox.com exactly yeah
26:21 - so css great it's kind of like flexbox
26:25 - on steroids like
26:26 - it's kind of like the next level of css
26:28 - screen so
26:29 - it's a bit harder than css flexbox
26:33 - but it's also a really good thing i mean
26:36 - a really good concept to learn
26:38 - and apply in your websites and other
26:41 - than that
26:42 - there are boots uh css frameworks that
26:45 - you can learn like bootstrap
26:46 - material ui bulma material material lies
26:50 - there's a lot the best and the most
26:53 - popular one is bootstrap
26:55 - so if you're starting out i'd say the
26:57 - best uh
26:58 - advice is learn css and then go for
27:01 - bootstrap
27:02 - or other css frameworks of your
27:05 - preference you know
27:06 - yep bootstrap is the best yeah bootstrap
27:08 - is the most famous
27:10 - framework for css in the world not
27:12 - kidding about that
27:14 - so the only fundamental that is left now
27:17 - would be
27:18 - javascript and exactly what is
27:20 - javascript man
27:22 - what is javascript how do you use
27:24 - javascript
27:25 - how do you use it what is it used for so
27:28 - javascript
27:29 - is what creates the functionality of a
27:31 - website like you click this
27:33 - page i mean you click this button and
27:35 - suddenly a pop-up comes out
27:37 - or it asks for something from you
27:40 - there's a lot
27:40 - everything like all the interaction is
27:43 - because of javascript
27:45 - i think we have that gif right after
27:47 - this slide right bro
27:48 - that's very funny one so this is an
27:50 - example of javascript code
27:52 - but i did want to mention um javascript
27:54 - is is amazing because yeah like uh amano
27:58 - was just saying it's the functionality
28:00 - it's like that it's it's like the 3d
28:03 - dimension of coding of web websites if i
28:06 - can say so because
28:08 - you know html and css are pretty they're
28:11 - just designed they're just
28:12 - text there's their way to stylize and
28:15 - share information
28:16 - javascript it's what is what it's like
28:18 - if that's length and
28:20 - width but oh you can't say it as the
28:22 - nervous system
28:23 - like you can have a body you can have a
28:25 - skeleton you can have a body if you
28:27 - don't have a nervous system
28:29 - your body does not work so javascript is
28:31 - the nervous system of a website
28:33 - whoa that's a beautiful way to put it
28:34 - yep yep it's what connects everything
28:37 - pretty much it moves everything so okay
28:39 - this is an example
28:40 - of a javascript code and it kind of
28:44 - it's funny because everybody was
28:46 - actually they thought about javascript
28:48 - as
28:48 - it not being it was a joke in the
28:50 - beginning i remember it was a joke
28:52 - people didn't take it too seriously
28:53 - and this was like 2010 and stuff and
28:56 - then
28:57 - everything started changing when it
28:59 - became super strong
29:00 - so now it even has a little bit of
29:02 - back-end with node.js
29:03 - now you can pretty much do everything
29:05 - with web development and this is a great
29:07 - example of what you can do
29:08 - with these fundamentals that we just
29:10 - taught you so you want to explain a
29:11 - little bit about this
29:13 - yeah like you say students who get
29:15 - bullied at school
29:16 - when they are young are the ones who
29:18 - shine very well at the end right
29:20 - so javascript got bullied and it started
29:23 - shining really well
29:28 - so html gives the skeleton for your
29:30 - website
29:31 - like what you saw it's really name you
29:33 - don't
29:34 - you know you don't see uh beauty in a
29:37 - skeleton right
29:38 - that's how the same when you have pure
29:41 - hdmi oh wow that's a great
29:42 - bro i love all your freaking metaphors
29:45 - they're amazing
29:45 - and by the way don't mean to cut you off
29:47 - but we just crossed the 300 likes on
29:50 - this video guys
29:51 - thank you guys so much
29:56 - [Music]
29:58 - so much we're at 309 let's get it to 350
30:02 - guys that would be amazing
30:04 - but don't mean to cut you off man you
30:06 - were saying skeletons are not
30:08 - that beautiful so html whoops kind of
30:10 - resembles that right
30:11 - yep exactly and then what you do you add
30:14 - a skin you
30:15 - add some makeup and you get css so css
30:19 - is kind of like the skin for your
30:20 - website
30:21 - like it gives colors it gives you a nice
30:24 - appearance
30:25 - it gives all the width and height for
30:27 - the buttons and all those stuff you know
30:30 - it just gives a beauty and then you have
30:32 - javascript
30:33 - it just goes crazy
30:37 - that's what javascript does javascript
30:38 - just dances so
30:40 - you know let's say that you have a
30:41 - button in your website and you want that
30:44 - button to open up a link you want that
30:46 - button to do something specific to hide
30:48 - a column anything like that all of that
30:50 - action that's being taken
30:52 - is going to be actually directed by
30:54 - javascript
30:55 - so javascript right over here to do a
30:58 - dance like that
30:59 - yeah yeah yeah that's why he loves
31:00 - javascript you know that's why nas is
31:02 - the main instructor because he dances
31:03 - just like
31:04 - this meme so javascript is the
31:06 - functionality of websites and
31:08 - all of these things put together are
31:10 - pretty much the foundation of web
31:12 - development you need to learn this first
31:14 - before going into
31:16 - any framework any library just make sure
31:18 - you you learn you understand vanilla
31:20 - javascript
31:21 - you understand these type of basics of
31:23 - html and css and libraries for css
31:25 - that's it guys it's not that complicated
31:28 - so when you say
31:29 - javascript it just pure javascript
31:32 - exactly that's that's why they call it
31:34 - vanilla because
31:35 - javascript like i said it was it was um
31:38 - what's that word it's
31:39 - it was kind of like an underdog in
31:41 - programming languages but as soon as it
31:42 - started getting super powerful then you
31:44 - started to be able to do anything with
31:45 - it
31:46 - the thing is there's so much to do with
31:48 - javascript it gets very confusing
31:49 - so what you want to do is make it simple
31:52 - for you learn the
31:53 - foundations and learning the foundations
31:55 - of javascript is called vanilla
31:56 - javascript
31:57 - which is just you know plain old
31:59 - javascript from there you go to
32:00 - frameworks like react angular
32:02 - view all of these so
32:06 - do you want to explain a little bit
32:07 - about this um yes
32:08 - [Music]
32:10 - front end back end full stack so that's
32:14 - what's like kind of like the second
32:16 - level when you start learning the basics
32:18 - and then people ask
32:19 - okay so you have learned the basics
32:21 - what's your aim is a front-end back-end
32:23 - or full stack so for now if you're just
32:26 - beginning out just
32:27 - ignore full step for a while okay and
32:30 - focus on front end or either backhand
32:32 - so if you're kind of like a really
32:34 - creative guy you know about colors like
32:37 - frankie you know
32:38 - he loves colors and all this stuff so
32:41 - if you are really creative go with front
32:44 - end
32:44 - and also if you are kind of like logic
32:47 - and you know
32:47 - things like cozy go with backhand that's
32:50 - why he chose python so
32:52 - but now you can choose you don't really
32:55 - need to know python for back-end you can
32:57 - learn
32:58 - javascript and learn node.js and use
33:00 - node.js as the back-end right
33:03 - and also another thing is i really like
33:05 - to make it as known
33:07 - is even if you're not creative you can
33:10 - build a creative mind like
33:12 - considering myself i was literally the
33:15 - designs that i'm making right now i just
33:17 - cannot believe because
33:18 - the thing is the more you expose
33:20 - yourself to design and all this stuff
33:22 - yeah you start building those skills
33:25 - it's kind of
33:26 - not a talent it's kind of like a skill
33:28 - you know
33:29 - that's true you can build creativity
33:31 - that's awesome man i i would
33:32 - think that you were very creative
33:34 - actually because of i've seen your
33:35 - designs
33:36 - and i myself love design so
33:39 - you know originally originally as i was
33:41 - studying computer science
33:43 - i wanted to become i i knew that i want
33:46 - to do something visual with it first it
33:47 - was a mobile developer so i was like
33:48 - okay dope i'm going to become an android
33:50 - developer because i want to see the
33:51 - things that i create i want to see them
33:53 - on my phone
33:54 - i want to be able to touch them i want
33:55 - to be able to interact with them and i
33:56 - want other people to
33:57 - see it then after that i was like okay
34:00 - like android is kind of
34:01 - dying but not really like still in the
34:02 - world a lot of people use android
34:04 - but i started using apple and i started
34:06 - falling in love with swift and i'm like
34:07 - cool mobile development is oh
34:09 - so awesome but then i kind of started to
34:11 - fall a little bit more in love with
34:12 - design which i wanted to go into ui
34:14 - and ux design i think it's very
34:16 - important as amanoth was saying right
34:18 - now
34:19 - you know front end is more for people
34:21 - that are a little bit more visual
34:22 - don't let you know if you are very
34:24 - analytical and stuff don't let that dis
34:25 - discourage you from from learning it but
34:27 - front end is regularly visual in what
34:30 - you see
34:30 - on the browser backhand also front end
34:33 - is
34:34 - seriously really important as back-end
34:37 - because
34:38 - the thing is you can have a really good
34:40 - back-end and have all this functionality
34:42 - and finally if it looks like a lame
34:44 - website where you don't know how
34:46 - things interact and all this stuff it's
34:48 - just going to be a waste so
34:50 - future front end back and both are
34:52 - really really important
34:54 - so yep i would even say i mean both are
34:56 - very important
34:57 - yeah i would even say front and is a
34:58 - little bit more important i know i'm
35:00 - gonna get hate for that
35:02 - but i do really think that because for
35:04 - example if you didn't like the way that
35:06 - instagram looks if you didn't like the
35:07 - way that facebook looks you would never
35:08 - use it if you don't like the way youtube
35:10 - works and how efficient it is how it
35:13 - looks you would never use it
35:14 - so run in is sometimes even more
35:16 - important in the back end even though
35:17 - both and also they won't even be
35:19 - watching this
35:20 - exactly yep exactly it wasn't like it is
35:23 - right now so you know going into the
35:26 - front end
35:27 - part of this teaching you know these are
35:29 - some of the most popular front-end
35:32 - frameworks out there right now it's
35:34 - they're huge so you want to mention a
35:36 - few of them
35:37 - so it's wartime it's wartime
35:41 - yeah because people literally fight a
35:43 - lot right
35:45 - yeah view you know
35:48 - they fight a lot so if you're a beginner
35:51 - just
35:52 - ignore the ignore angular and view first
35:55 - for a set for the time being and focus
35:57 - on react
35:58 - because react it's not because we do a
36:01 - lot of videos on react
36:02 - it's because react is really easy and
36:05 - it's also really lightweight because
36:07 - it's not
36:07 - a framework it's a library right so
36:11 - if you are beginning first learn the
36:13 - basics and
36:14 - learn basics of javascript kind of like
36:17 - functions and how all this stuff works
36:20 - and then go
36:21 - with react you know and the best way to
36:24 - learn
36:24 - is building projects so
36:28 - you can build projects like that we have
36:29 - the netflix clone the
36:31 - hulu clone the airbnb if you have all
36:33 - this stuff
36:34 - so you can learn react just by literally
36:37 - watching all these clones you know
36:39 - you have all this stuff so yeah man
36:41 - react
36:42 - is amazing because it's the next step if
36:44 - you did learn vanilla javascript what's
36:46 - cool about this
36:47 - is that damn you get to realize how much
36:50 - tech companies how much influence they
36:51 - have on the coding space obviously
36:54 - so react was made by facebook it's what
36:55 - they currently use
36:57 - uh javascript library framework that
36:58 - they use angular is made by google
37:00 - it's funny because vue was made by uh
37:03 - an angular developer so you know it's
37:06 - both of these are pretty much google and
37:08 - this one is facebook and they're the one
37:09 - of the most
37:10 - um you know famous frameworks for front
37:13 - end and javascript in general and as
37:15 - amanda was saying right now
37:16 - the best way to learn react right now in
37:19 - my opinion in
37:20 - youtube at least is go to our youtube
37:22 - channel
37:23 - and check out all of these amazing
37:25 - projects that we've
37:26 - built so you know what are some of these
37:28 - projects among us
37:30 - so we have starting with the to-do list
37:33 - which is the most basic one we have
37:35 - the netflix clone the instagram clone
37:38 - the
37:39 - really really advanced at the most
37:41 - amazing amazon clone
37:43 - we have tinder hulu kobe tracker
37:47 - we have almost i think 20 clones yep
37:50 - yep or even more man i don't know yeah
37:53 - like once you
37:54 - kind of like finished with all these
37:56 - loans you're gonna be
37:58 - the react god or the next papa react
38:01 - yeah
38:01 - guys seriously guys seriously if you
38:03 - guys
38:05 - are not playing and you do want to get
38:06 - an atlanta job as a developer you do
38:08 - want to up your skills as a developer
38:10 - you need to start working on projects
38:12 - and we decided as a team
38:14 - to work on you know let's dissect the
38:17 - biggest websites in the world
38:19 - right now the biggest websites and apps
38:20 - and let's show people how to build them
38:23 - so that they can put it on their
38:24 - portfolio for free
38:26 - and also another reason that we are
38:28 - doing bit the clones
38:30 - is because the designs have actually
38:33 - worked
38:33 - you know because you can come up with an
38:37 - idea from scratch
38:38 - that's huge the design might not work
38:41 - but the design of facebook the design of
38:43 - instagram have worked and that's why
38:45 - people are using it and that's why we
38:47 - made a clone of those
38:48 - so you can learn how you can build
38:50 - designs like that
38:52 - in your own projects you know yep we
38:54 - could have easily said okay let's
38:56 - let's teach them how to create a website
38:58 - with
38:59 - a database that pulls out movies and
39:01 - then maybe even place trailers
39:03 - okay we can do a tutorial like that or
39:06 - we can just build netflix
39:07 - because netflix already put in so much
39:10 - so many
39:10 - millions and millions of dollars into
39:12 - testing their ui testing how their
39:14 - customers interact with the whole
39:16 - website so just model
39:17 - these huge companies that have already
39:20 - tested out these things that's the best
39:21 - way for you to learn the best way for
39:23 - you to integrate
39:24 - you know things that are efficient and
39:26 - effective and not just
39:27 - be so hard-headed and thinking like oh
39:29 - okay this design
39:31 - like a monolith just saying this design
39:33 - i think it's gonna work because i really
39:34 - like blue and i really like squares
39:36 - no bro that's not how the world works
39:38 - you know actually
39:40 - model things that work and also the
39:43 - thing is
39:44 - we students have landed jobs just by
39:47 - doing these clones like frank ramos did
39:49 - the spotify clone
39:50 - and landed a job at sonos which is the
39:54 - biggest u.s audio company and then we
39:56 - have jen
39:57 - who landed a job like twice the amount
40:01 - of salary she has yes she was earning
40:03 - just by betting tracker i think she was
40:05 - earning yeah 46
40:06 - 000 and then she started um earning 96
40:10 - 000 after joining profit with javascript
40:12 - and
40:13 - also building this specific video
40:15 - literally this video got her a 96
40:17 - thousand dollar job
40:18 - she put this she finished it put her on
40:20 - a portfolio and
40:21 - she got a job after losing her job in
40:24 - covid which is an amazing amazing story
40:27 - so yeah guys don't sleep on it pay
40:29 - attention to this
40:30 - actual content we're putting out it is
40:32 - real world so
40:34 - take it into practice now going a little
40:36 - bit deeper into
40:38 - the other side of web development which
40:40 - would be
40:41 - back-end frameworks i know it's a little
40:43 - bit it's a little bit blurry guys so
40:45 - bear with us
40:46 - so you know these are the differences of
40:48 - 2018 and 2019
40:50 - some of the biggest languages out there
40:52 - so
40:53 - off the bat you can see that one of the
40:55 - biggest frameworks right now
40:57 - sorry i said languages but it's
40:58 - frameworks some of the biggest
40:59 - frameworks right now
41:00 - on um what's it called back-end is going
41:03 - to be node.js made by
41:04 - javascript different uh javascript
41:08 - framework benefit is
41:11 - the benefit of learning node.js is
41:13 - because you just only have to learn one
41:15 - language you know
41:16 - like suppose you are front like if you
41:19 - go back
41:20 - about 10 or 15 years back you didn't
41:22 - have node.js
41:24 - and the thing is you have to learn html
41:26 - says as javascript for the front end
41:28 - and then you gotta have to learn
41:29 - something like python or java or dotnet
41:32 - to build the back end but now the
41:35 - benefit is you just have to learn
41:38 - the same language to do the do both you
41:41 - know
41:42 - exactly exactly and node.js a lot of
41:44 - people are liking it right now
41:46 - community big communities being built up
41:48 - it's really popping it's
41:50 - really in you know it's it's it's like
41:52 - the new generation of backend
41:54 - languages or frameworks sorry so angular
41:57 - was
41:58 - pretty big on 2018 then it took a little
42:00 - bit of a dive
42:02 - in 2019 and net went up
42:06 - so pandas which would be every python
42:09 - then react native is another you know
42:13 - javascript framework so all of these are
42:15 - the the famous one django you can see
42:17 - spring is a javascript as a java
42:19 - framework i believe
42:21 - yeah yeah tensorflow it's also
42:24 - ai and python xamarin is a hybrid
42:28 - there's a lot yeah it's a hybrid of um
42:31 - it's it's hybrid development just like
42:32 - react native
42:34 - anyways so these are all examples of
42:36 - back end one of the biggest most popular
42:38 - back-end
42:39 - framework right now is what amana
42:42 - the one
42:52 - but this just came up and
42:56 - praveen i actually came up like two
42:58 - minutes ago i forgot to pull it up
42:59 - but praveen uh donated had a donation of
43:03 - 20 indian rupees thank you so much man
43:06 - we
43:06 - really really appreciate that i love you
43:08 - guys love the cp fam i think that
43:10 - deserves a dj airhorn
43:13 - let's go thank you guys so much we love
43:15 - you we are at 277 likes that is amazing
43:18 - guys let's keep the energy up we're
43:20 - about to finish this presentation and
43:21 - you're going to take
43:22 - home some amazing knowledge that amanoth
43:25 - and i am dropping right now
43:27 - we were hitting on the merge stack so
43:29 - burn
43:30 - is one of the most popular back-end
43:31 - frameworks like amano was saying
43:34 - and what else so we can say it's not
43:36 - kind of like
43:37 - back in framework it's kind of like this
43:39 - combination of frameworks yeah
43:40 - combination of frameworks that you use
43:42 - to create a full stack application
43:44 - so we have mongodb which is a nosql
43:46 - database we have express js
43:49 - we have react as the front-end framework
43:51 - and then we have node.js as the backend
43:53 - framework
43:54 - a combination of the all of this can
43:57 - help you build a full stack application
43:59 - the thing is while we were building the
44:02 - react clones
44:03 - we built the same clones in one so
44:07 - once you have mastered react you can go
44:09 - do the same clone
44:10 - with one stack and learn all four of
44:14 - these technologies you know
44:15 - so you're going to become dr moon
44:18 - like david says yeah so these are
44:22 - actually all of the videos that amano
44:23 - was talking about right now
44:25 - we got the whatsapp mern clone we got
44:27 - the instagrammer and clone the
44:28 - tindermern clone and the tiktok merlin
44:30 - clone
44:30 - learn how to build these put them in
44:32 - your portfolio they're actually
44:34 - so useful for you to get a job people
44:36 - have already gotten them like we were
44:37 - saying
44:38 - thing about this and mern stack is that
44:40 - if you want to become very knowledgeable
44:42 - and you want to come you want to become
44:43 - a full stack developer this is one of
44:44 - the stacks that
44:45 - most people are using mongodb express
44:48 - react and nodejs as we were mentioning
44:51 - node.js
44:51 - is one of the biggest frameworks for
44:53 - backend right now react is one of the
44:55 - biggest frameworks
44:56 - in front end right now mongodb is one of
44:59 - the most
44:59 - famous and used nosql databases out
45:02 - there
45:03 - and then express what is express i don't
45:05 - know what expresses do you know express
45:06 - it is called the run time
45:08 - and i think yeah it's kind of like the
45:10 - one-time involvement you create
45:12 - to run the application i see it like i
45:16 - know
45:16 - it's kind of like a server kind of thing
45:19 - okay so it's
45:20 - express js nice beautiful so
45:23 - all of these things are super in right
45:25 - now so learn the merge stack these are
45:27 - some of the resources
45:29 - that we provided for you guys maybe take
45:31 - a screenshot of this
45:32 - we think youtube might be one of the
45:34 - best one and it's also free
45:36 - so what's better than free knowledge
45:38 - education that can actually up
45:40 - every single different stage of your
45:42 - life every part of your life you know
45:44 - from your monetary to your knowledge to
45:46 - your relationships
45:47 - learn it from youtube and honestly
45:50 - anything free
45:51 - so what are other learning resources man
45:54 - then we have free code cam so
45:56 - you go to freecodecam.org
46:00 - it's kind of like a modular-based
46:02 - lessons you get modular-based
46:04 - lessons with quizzes exercises that you
46:07 - can work on
46:08 - so just go to freecodecam.org
46:12 - and you can pretty much learn the whole
46:14 - web development i mean
46:16 - learn for development and then we have
46:18 - frontier mentor
46:20 - so frontend mentor is a really great
46:22 - place where you can practice what you've
46:24 - learned
46:25 - so that is what i did like i
46:28 - what i've asked my brother it's kind of
46:29 - like a challenge that i'm doing with my
46:31 - brother
46:32 - is he learns all this stuff and then i
46:34 - ask him
46:36 - sorry oh my my own brother
46:39 - yeah how old is he um he's
46:42 - 15 i guess yeah 15. nice and you do a
46:45 - challenge with him
46:46 - yeah so i just want to inspire him and
46:49 - he is
46:49 - taking challenges from frontal mentor
46:52 - and he's
46:52 - killing it and he's doing all those
46:54 - projects you know like
46:56 - i gave him a challenge to do a slack
46:58 - clone i mean
46:59 - the slack landing page and he just did
47:02 - uh the same exact web page you know wow
47:06 - that's crazy man and at 15 wow like
47:10 - these things are not even taught in
47:11 - school that's the cool thing about it
47:12 - like it's actual practical real world
47:14 - knowledge
47:15 - no excuses guys you have all these free
47:17 - resources
47:19 - and just the thing is you just gotta do
47:21 - it you know
47:23 - the only thing stopping you is just
47:24 - doing it so front end mentor you get
47:28 - challenges like they give you a landing
47:30 - page and what you've got to do is just
47:32 - recreate the same page from code so
47:35 - that's a really way to practice what
47:37 - you've learned then we have w3schools
47:40 - and
47:40 - mdm web docs it's kind of like the
47:42 - documentation for html css and
47:44 - javascript
47:45 - and htmlreference.io and cssreference.io
47:49 - is also kind of like the same
47:51 - and also two resources that i'd like to
47:54 - add to this
47:55 - is one is called reactive flux so i
47:58 - think if you can type it out that would
48:00 - be great
48:01 - a frankie so it's called reactive flux
48:06 - give me one second so yeah let's put it
48:08 - here
48:09 - react t flux
48:12 - t i t i no uh it's just one t
48:17 - sorry t i f l u x
48:20 - so reactive flux is a discharge yeah
48:23 - reactive flux is a discord server where
48:25 - you have around
48:27 - 150 000 react developers and also
48:30 - i got stuck in an error when i was
48:33 - working with react and i just dropped
48:35 - only one message
48:36 - and people started helping me helping me
48:38 - because the
48:40 - most important thing when you're
48:42 - learning to code is having a community
48:44 - like
48:44 - the clever programmer community the best
48:46 - coding community you can find in the
48:48 - world
48:49 - so if you try if you cannot afford
48:52 - like pwj or thing you have a lot of
48:55 - stuff you can learn from you know
48:57 - no no excuses so check out reactive lux
49:00 - and the other website is called react
49:02 - resources dot com
49:04 - and you can literally find resources
49:07 - free resources to learn anything in
49:10 - react
49:11 - so reactive flux and react resources dot
49:13 - com
49:14 - ah a bonus if you have been watching
49:16 - around till now
49:18 - nice those are amazing man and it's
49:20 - great that they have helped you
49:21 - personally
49:22 - i do want to mention that somebody just
49:24 - gave one
49:25 - another donation man it's insane people
49:28 - are going crazy this is insane let me
49:30 - actually make it bigger for you guys
49:31 - um here we go so i think i have to
49:35 - like this to share it oh man i lost it
49:37 - so
49:38 - anyways let me take another screenshot
49:40 - of it really fast because we're really
49:42 - grateful for the people that do take
49:43 - their time to
49:44 - donate man because you know it doesn't
49:47 - matter the amount what matters is really
49:49 - the intent
49:50 - and we're all here to learn if somebody
49:52 - can you know
49:54 - do put more wood into the fire that's
49:56 - that's amazing man and harsha modini
49:59 - says what are your thoughts on flutter
50:02 - one languages three os on floater one
50:06 - languages three os i don't understand
50:07 - the question completely um i think
50:09 - he's asking about flutter so flutter is
50:12 - mainly for web i mean application
50:16 - android application and ios application
50:18 - developer so what you can
50:19 - instead of your flutter you can learn
50:21 - react native so it's kind of gonna
50:23 - become
50:24 - a whole package for you like you know
50:26 - how to create web applications
50:28 - plus mobile applications which is really
50:30 - valuable you know
50:31 - like if you learn proper you can only be
50:33 - developing mobile applications
50:35 - but if you learn react and react native
50:38 - you can
50:38 - do both yep that's a great way to look
50:41 - at it man flutter
50:42 - is the framework for the language start
50:45 - and dart is made by google so
50:49 - flutter is cool because it's it's
50:50 - google's response to
50:52 - facebook response to hybrid development
50:55 - which is pretty much you know
50:56 - making an app that works pretty much
50:58 - everywhere uh android and then also ios
51:01 - and then also web development
51:03 - pretty much so and also another advice
51:05 - is like
51:06 - the thing is most people is kind of like
51:09 - they say
51:10 - what what if i do flutter what if i do
51:12 - react
51:13 - what if i do this what if i do it's not
51:15 - the thing you just do it
51:17 - if you think okay i need to do flutter
51:19 - just dive in
51:21 - try one one or two months into it and
51:24 - see if it's gonna work for you if it
51:26 - does not it's just not a waste of time
51:28 - you just learned a lesson you know
51:29 - exactly exactly just
51:31 - just test it out test it out that's it
51:33 - that's today's model pretty much
51:36 - just test things out don't take anything
51:38 - for granted
51:39 - um don't give too many too much spice
51:42 - space or time two things and you know we
51:45 - were speaking about
51:46 - a lot of resources right now we think
51:48 - one of the best resources in the world
51:50 - as a developer would be definitely
51:54 - google yep
51:58 - yeah man it's funny that's how you learn
51:59 - everything you know that's how you
52:00 - answer all of your questions
52:02 - as developers and a little bit ago i was
52:04 - just mentioning that you have to be
52:05 - resourceful
52:06 - and big big big portion of the
52:09 - development jobs have to do with
52:10 - researching
52:11 - and pretty much googling things man
52:13 - because most people have already
52:14 - stumbled upon
52:15 - you know the bugs that you have stumbled
52:17 - upon your code so there's a lot of
52:18 - forums like stack overflow there's a
52:20 - bunch of
52:21 - you know different resources in the web
52:22 - right now that can actually help you out
52:24 - with your problems
52:25 - so this is a funny meme that we found
52:27 - and it says
52:28 - when you start working as a programmer
52:30 - how to get date in c
52:32 - plus right and then 10 years of
52:33 - experience later you're still in google
52:36 - and literally googling the same thing
52:38 - the thing is
52:39 - if you can't remember thing it's not
52:41 - it's not the motive of programming you
52:43 - know the motive of programming is just
52:45 - creating solutions to problem it does
52:47 - not mean like you need to
52:50 - remember how to create a dictionary
52:52 - python or how to create a function in
52:54 - python
52:54 - it's not the motive the motive of
52:56 - programming is to create solutions to
52:58 - problems so if you can't remember that's
53:01 - completely okay it's completely fine you
53:03 - know you have google
53:04 - as a savior yep you don't have to code
53:07 - things from scratch guys
53:09 - most of the advanced developers that i
53:11 - know always are googling stuff
53:13 - and even code faster than people that
53:14 - are coding from scratch it just doesn't
53:16 - make sense
53:16 - so people and this meme right here says
53:19 - not sure if i'm a good developer i'm
53:20 - good at googling
53:22 - it's pretty much the same thing man it's
53:23 - pretty much the same thing now at this
53:24 - point
53:25 - and i'll take off that image so you guys
53:26 - can see it but moving forward
53:28 - you know one of the big things about
53:30 - resources is that you know resources
53:32 - help you learn but ultimately what's
53:34 - going to help you learn the most is
53:36 - choosing a project to work with just
53:38 - like omanath was just saying
53:40 - some of the projects that we've built
53:41 - for you guys are already on our youtube
53:43 - channel they're free
53:44 - for you to see you can put them on your
53:45 - portfolio maybe even land a job like
53:47 - most of
53:48 - you know a lot of our students have and
53:50 - this is one example of the websites that
53:52 - we build
53:52 - you want to add something to this so
53:55 - this is
53:56 - the netflix club right so
53:59 - choose a project just work on it you
54:01 - know and also
54:02 - a three-step strategy that i use is
54:05 - when you're working first time on a
54:07 - project i mean like
54:09 - when you're watching a tutorial and
54:10 - doing it just watch the tutorial and
54:12 - just
54:13 - code the thing up and make it working
54:15 - you know
54:16 - so that's one accomplishment and the
54:18 - second time what you do
54:20 - is you don't watch the video you start
54:22 - on your own
54:23 - like you got the idea of how the project
54:25 - is done right
54:26 - so what you do you start coding on your
54:28 - own and when you get stuck
54:30 - you refer the video or the tutorial of
54:32 - the article that you did
54:34 - and the third time what you do you don't
54:36 - literally don't
54:37 - have access to the tutorial or the
54:39 - article or anything
54:40 - just start coding it up and when you
54:42 - find yourself stuck
54:44 - what you do just google it like how can
54:47 - i create
54:48 - the date picker or how do i create this
54:50 - component or how do i style this
54:52 - component
54:53 - just google it and try to build it on
54:55 - your own that way it's going to concrete
54:57 - the knowledge in you
54:58 - you know like you it's kind of like you
55:02 - go from
55:02 - beginner level to an advanced level one
55:06 - project like to learn because the
55:09 - reason why people are stuck in tutorial
55:11 - hello anything
55:12 - just they just copy paste code or kind
55:15 - of like
55:16 - just see okay so he's having use effect
55:18 - over there i'm just typing it
55:20 - there so you don't literally understand
55:22 - why you use use effect
55:23 - over there why do you use the remove
55:25 - event listener
55:26 - why do you use the this device use that
55:30 - div and all this stuff you know
55:32 - yeah man i completely completely agree
55:34 - it's a difference between taking in
55:35 - information and making your information
55:37 - practical that's it
55:38 - it's like you can get information for
55:41 - the rest of your life but if you never
55:43 - practice it
55:44 - then the map is not the same as the
55:46 - territory like people say
55:48 - you know a map is just uh it's just a
55:51 - symbol or representation of
55:52 - the territory that it's mapping out
55:55 - right so it's not the same thing
55:57 - and put it into practice guys don't lose
55:59 - your time this is another example of one
56:01 - of the builds that we made
56:02 - one of the most one of the famous videos
56:04 - that we released actually one of the
56:05 - most pop-in ones and it's the amazon
56:08 - project in this amazon project we did it
56:11 - two ways we did it with react and
56:12 - firebase and we also did it in the mern
56:14 - stack with which
56:15 - uses mongodb if you guys want to learn
56:17 - how to build that this is amazing it's a
56:19 - full ecommerce functionality website
56:21 - and we show you step by step not only do
56:23 - we show you step by step but we even
56:24 - make it cool we make it fun for you guys
56:26 - it's not like
56:26 - we're gonna sit down and just program
56:29 - right
56:30 - exactly man it we make it fun you know
56:33 - it's
56:33 - that's the thing and that's the whole
56:34 - point of clever programmer really
56:36 - programming can be fun
56:37 - it doesn't always have to be depressive
56:39 - boring and stale
56:41 - so programming is fun so yeah man i want
56:44 - to describe this a little bit because
56:46 - amano actually does a bunch most of the
56:49 - posts
56:50 - and use of two that we release on
56:52 - instagram our instagram has been growing
56:53 - like crazy if you do
56:55 - enjoy this content make sure to follow
56:57 - clever quasi so that you can follow the
56:59 - clever programmer
57:00 - instagram so you want to go a little bit
57:02 - deep into this honor
57:04 - yeah so tutorial or tutorial purgatory
57:07 - which is really common with wannabe
57:11 - developers you know
57:12 - who just dive into coding the reason why
57:15 - you are in tutorial health so
57:17 - before what why you are here what is it
57:20 - it's kind of like you feeling yourself
57:23 - that you are not making progress
57:25 - and you're kind of stuck inside a loop
57:27 - of watching
57:28 - tutorials again and again and again so
57:31 - how can i escape tutorial help right so
57:35 - uh frank you can't just go to the next
57:37 - slide bro
57:39 - cool i was just seeing that people are
57:41 - saying that there's an echo can you guys
57:42 - hear an echo
57:43 - drop it in the comments if you hear an
57:45 - echo i don't hear one
57:47 - but okay cool so what is tutorial hell
57:53 - so you follow along the tutorial and
57:56 - understand everything they do
57:57 - and you do create what they do by coding
58:00 - along but you cannot create things on
58:02 - your own oracle and rely on tutorials
58:04 - for
58:05 - everything yep that's what you were just
58:07 - mentioning
58:09 - exactly so
58:12 - the reasons you're stuck is you find it
58:14 - easy to just
58:15 - keep following tutorials because when
58:18 - you try to code
58:19 - things up on your own you find it really
58:22 - hard because
58:23 - it's just the beginning guys you know
58:24 - you cannot become the greatest developer
58:27 - in just two months that's not how it
58:29 - works
58:30 - just gotta put in the work you gotta put
58:32 - in the motions you gotta put in the
58:34 - dedication and all the all this stuff to
58:37 - become a great developer
58:39 - so the reason is you find it easy to
58:41 - just follow all the tutorials
58:43 - and the second thing when you follow
58:45 - tutorials and you build projects just
58:47 - watching the tutorials it gives you a
58:49 - sense
58:50 - that you're making progress and the
58:52 - second thing is
58:53 - why you don't want to come out of
58:55 - tutorials is because you feel
58:57 - yourself as insecure when you come out
58:59 - of a tutorial
59:00 - you know yeah i think
59:04 - very bad sound quality let me say very
59:06 - bad sound quality is that better guys
59:08 - tell us if that's better i think they
59:10 - said that there was an echo but
59:11 - you know tutorial hell is actually um
59:15 - give me one sec so somebody says yes
59:19 - no change cool so tutorial hell is
59:22 - actually
59:23 - interesting because a lot of people find
59:25 - themselves there it's actually kind of
59:27 - like one of the stages of growth to be
59:28 - honest with you
59:29 - and people find it easy so that you know
59:32 - you follow the tutorial copy paste the
59:34 - code and they think that they're getting
59:36 - they think that they're actually getting
59:38 - um what's it called
59:42 - advanced progress exactly progress and
59:45 - they're not
59:46 - directly and also another thing is i
59:48 - like to say is
59:49 - tutorial hell is kind of like the word
59:51 - depression you know like
59:53 - when people bit sad they say
59:56 - oh no i got depression and like when
59:59 - new wannabe developers just get into
60:01 - coding they say
60:02 - you know what i got stuck in tutorial
60:05 - hell it's kind of like
60:06 - a what do you say a fashion you know to
60:09 - say or kind of like a trend
60:11 - yeah you know you say oh man you know
60:13 - i'm stuck in tutorial hell
60:15 - you know yeah yeah it's kind of like
60:17 - looks cool when you're saying those
60:19 - stuff you know
60:20 - exactly yeah now people started rocking
60:22 - it like they own it so that's
60:24 - it's good and it's bad at the same time
60:26 - so you know
60:27 - starting off with code at the end of the
60:28 - day practicing code is what's going to
60:30 - make you a better developer
60:31 - not anything else so people do ask this
60:34 - question a lot and the question is how
60:36 - long should i code every day
60:38 - and amano has made a really cool diagram
60:40 - for you guys that i think can be very
60:41 - practical if you take it into practice
60:43 - and
60:44 - this will greatly massively improve your
60:46 - coding so
60:48 - this is the 30-minute rule you want to
60:51 - explain a little bit about that man
60:53 - yep so the thing is there are people who
60:55 - might be going for work and doing jobs
60:57 - and all this stuff
60:58 - and they might not find enough time to
61:00 - do coding so if you are really into it
61:03 - the best way to start is doing 30
61:05 - minutes every day
61:07 - you know if you don't have literally no
61:09 - time
61:10 - just start doing by 30 minutes every day
61:13 - and those 30 minutes
61:14 - will add up to how many hours per week
61:18 - or three and a half hours so it's half
61:20 - hours per week
61:21 - you know one two three four five six
61:24 - seven
61:24 - okay so when you add all these up
61:27 - it comes up to 168 hours of coding per
61:31 - year you know it's kind of like the
61:34 - amount of
61:35 - the hours of coding that uh a cs
61:38 - graduate does right
61:39 - yep frankie yeah yeah yeah um i don't
61:42 - know exactly
61:43 - how many hours a cs graduate um does
61:46 - code
61:47 - honestly i would say it's it's a little
61:49 - bit more than this i would say more than
61:50 - 168.
61:52 - in my years of um of college i'd say a
61:55 - little bit more than 168 honestly
61:57 - but dude if you quote for 168 hours a
62:00 - year
62:00 - like you're just gonna be a beast you're
62:02 - gonna be a beast and it's not
62:04 - it's not even about guys really do take
62:06 - this into account i'm going to be very
62:08 - serious with you i know we were having a
62:09 - lot of fun
62:10 - but this is serious if you are going to
62:12 - put in
62:13 - 30 minutes a day like we're saying it's
62:15 - not about putting in 30 minutes a day
62:17 - it's the quality of the practice that
62:18 - you do
62:19 - you can literally spend 30 minutes doing
62:21 -  doing nothing learning from the
62:23 - worst resources ever and you're not
62:25 - going to get anywhere
62:26 - it's not about putting in the 30 minutes
62:27 - it's about the quality that you put in
62:30 - those 30 minutes practice perfect
62:32 - practice makes
62:33 - perfect what is it perfect practice
62:35 - makes perfect
62:36 - it's not just practice okay so make sure
62:39 - to
62:39 - to get the good resources and put in the
62:41 - time also
62:43 - and also like you finding an excuse to
62:46 - say you don't have 13 minutes
62:48 - it's just you know like you can
62:52 - go on instagram and just go on instagram
62:55 - for 30 minutes you know
62:57 - you don't feel that time but if you can
62:58 - just put those 30 minutes into coding
63:02 - without you knowingly you're going to
63:04 - code for 168 hours in just a year
63:06 - you know and you're going to become a
63:08 - beast yeah man you spend
63:10 - freaking 30 minutes a day just coat just
63:13 - literally scrolling through instagram
63:14 - literally like not doing anything
63:16 - anything like that bro like
63:18 - just allocate your time a little bit
63:19 - better and be responsible
63:21 - that's it so that was
63:24 - how to code how much you should code
63:26 - every day check out the instagram if you
63:29 - to go if you guys want to see more
63:30 - diagrams like that amanov and yusuf are
63:32 - dropping really far once
63:34 - every single day to so check them out so
63:36 - amanda's was showing me
63:38 - this specific website and i think it's
63:40 - really amazing man we were talking about
63:42 - different roadmaps or careers that you
63:43 - can take
63:44 - with um with just you know web
63:47 - development in general
63:48 - so this is the website and let's
63:51 - actually
63:52 - go to it yeah for sure bro
63:55 - cool so it's what is it called man it's
63:57 - called roadmap.sh
63:59 - make it bigger for you guys so you guys
64:01 - can see let's see does that look good
64:03 - okay i think that's great awesome yeah
64:04 - perfect so yep it's uh roadmap.sh
64:08 - we'll try to put these links in the
64:10 - description below guys and this is kind
64:12 - of how it looks so it's a different
64:14 - developer roadmap so off the bat here
64:16 - you can check out and you can see
64:18 - that there's front end there's back end
64:20 - there's devops
64:21 - there's react there's android postgres
64:25 - a little bit more back end devops yeah
64:28 - also if you can just go to the front and
64:29 - we can show people how
64:31 - you know what the format is yep and
64:33 - that's the cool thing about
64:34 - this website is if you want to learn a
64:36 - little bit more about front end it's
64:37 - going to tell you the road map
64:39 - to it like right here so
64:42 - from the developer then the internet how
64:45 - the internet works how the websites work
64:47 - how everything is connected
64:49 - together and
64:52 - yeah man it's it's it's it gets very
64:55 - complex if you do insane
64:59 - if you do follow it man it's it's really
65:01 - going to help you understand you know
65:02 - how everything is connected
65:04 - what part of the journey each thing is
65:06 - in like here you can see bootstrap you
65:08 - know the
65:09 - css libraries that we were just
65:10 - mentioning or frameworks
65:12 - and you know how progressive web apps
65:14 - are connected to whether that's
65:16 - actually the map only just looks so
65:19 - complicated but the thing is via
65:21 - actually when you're using react it's
65:24 - already
65:24 - progressive with maps you know and also
65:28 - it's just simple stuff that you just
65:30 - over complicate the map
65:32 - just shows you the road map but it's not
65:35 - as complicated
65:36 - as it looks you know yeah take it step
65:38 - by step you know
65:40 - learn to digest it put a little bit of
65:42 - time into it just go through it so that
65:44 - it makes sense so that's the front end
65:45 - roadmap this is the back end roadmap and
65:48 - it starts off the same you know
65:50 - showing the internet what is http all
65:52 - these
65:53 - you know secure type of um verifications
65:57 - the domains dns how all of that is
66:00 - connected no sql databases
66:02 - also i think when they say about like
66:04 - you know always and general knowledge
66:06 - i think seriously it's kind of like
66:10 - more technical stuff but if you're just
66:12 - starting out i don't think
66:14 - like you nee you need to have a basic
66:16 - knowledge of how internet works and all
66:18 - this stuff
66:18 - but i don't think like you need to go
66:20 - really deep into all those stuff you
66:22 - know
66:22 - yep i agree man don't go so deep into
66:25 - you know learning how a computer works
66:27 - like how all of these things work
66:29 - most computer science students they make
66:31 - them go through that route i think it's
66:33 - beautiful to learn
66:34 - those things but if you really want to
66:36 - get you know the skills you really want
66:38 - to get the career you really want to get
66:39 - the money
66:40 - and the actual knowledge guys make it
66:43 - practical
66:45 - actually drop the complex complexity
66:47 - like if you make it simple
66:49 - it's going to be easier for you to start
66:50 - it's going to be easy for you to
66:52 - actually
66:52 - put you know things into practice guys
66:55 - so let's go a little bit into android
66:57 - these are all the different road maps
66:58 - guys you know check them out
67:00 - i don't think you should delve so deep
67:02 - into them but there's so many different
67:04 - ways that you can
67:05 - tackle this
67:09 - whoops so i'm going back to it again but
67:11 - going back to the presentation
67:12 - so these are the career paths and
67:14 - honestly guys there's so much to do
67:16 - we do want to wrap up because we've been
67:18 - talking about for about an hour we're
67:20 - gonna
67:20 - you know save you guys his time anything
67:22 - that you want to mention at this point
67:23 - among us
67:25 - so yeah my drop yeah
67:28 - like obama yep
67:32 - oh you cannot drop that mic yeah boom
67:34 - let's try this
67:36 - let's go i'm kidding but yeah so
67:39 - yeah that guy's guys go ahead man take
67:42 - action
67:44 - start coding and also hit me up at um
67:47 - wait is it where like this yep it's
67:50 - right there
67:51 - come on and just wait can i touch it
67:54 - yeah you're
67:54 - go a little bit down right there right
67:56 - there right there oh yeah
67:58 - oh yes quickly

68:09 - yeah i'll be glad to help you guys so
68:11 - yeah guys hit us up on instagram
68:13 - amano has amazing knowledge he's killing
68:16 - it for our instagram
68:17 - and he's also bringing so much knowledge
68:19 - to the whole community
68:20 - we want to wrap this up guys thank you
68:22 - guys so much this is pretty much
68:24 - going to be you know the road map that
68:25 - you should take if you are uh
68:27 - an absolute beginner in web development
68:29 - you want to get an idea what to do
68:31 - hopefully you had fun hopefully you get
68:32 - you got good resources off of this
68:34 - hopefully
68:35 - you also got a good mindset off of this
68:37 - that i know

Cleaned transcript:

what is up guys frankie here with cleverprogrammer.com i'm here with my friend amanath what's up amanda yo what's up guys how's it going so glad to be live with you guys and share some knowledge hell yeah man i love this kid today we're going to be talking about learn web development in 2021 so we're going to discuss the best ways that you can learn web development as an absolute beginner and it's awesome because ominous developer journey is is very recent as well right amanda yep exactly so i started holding april or april nice go ahead yep so i kind of started in april but i was working with python for a while about like one and a half years back but so this is kind of new and i've also like learned a lot about what web development is like like kind of like a fast track way you can go and also a lot of resources that you can use and everything yeah man it's it's amazing so we got a fresh perspective on it and then also just you know the whole company's perspective on it so let's move forward with this web development 2021 you know obviously for you to pick up web development the first thing that you got to do is pretty much just do it you know like my friend shia i don't remember his last name what's his last name uh who's last name this guy she uh um debut for something okay anyways so if you want to learn web development you have to start on it guys and that's the best way you know if you do enjoy our content we're putting out fire content every single day we're going live for you guys teaching you guys the best resources for web development and just the best projects in general that'll help you land a job so if you do enjoy that that specific content that we put out what should they do aminos just go smash that like button guys just smash it hell yeah i love these animations by the way so what's going on here in the chat okay we're sunny sunny is actually working on some react modules for profit with javascript guys and that's going to be awesome and what else do i see here first video nikhil is it first video nikhil what's up man how you doing it's not our first video but maybe you maybe it's your first video from us frank reminds me of guilfoyle from silicon valley damn that's awesome dude that guy is freaking awesome anyways guys uh i stole this slide from sunny speaking about sunny and i think it's really amazing if you guys right now just pay attention to this live stream because if you do at the end of this live stream you're going to get out to the best roadmap that you can get as an absolute beginner to actually learn web development so get your phone out right now put it on do not disturb and turn it on back on when we're done with this presentation hell yeah so this is how we start do you want to explain a little bit about this amanov yeah so when you're starting with development you must have an end goal in mind because that's finally it right so when you're starting with a football match that's what we put this gif right over here why do you start to play football or you're starting with the match your end goal is just have more goals than the opposite team so this in web development or in your career as a web developer it's not you're competing against another person it's kind of like competing with yourself so when you're starting out have an end goal in mind like when i started i had a goal of creating a web application for my dad's education uh institute so it's kind of like still uh under creation so that was my end goal so i was thinking like when i started in april i would be able to create that application by november but the thing is it takes a lot of time and you must be dedicated and always just persevere be relentless just keep going but always have an end goal in mind you know that's a beautiful way to put it man end goals are really your destination so always keep it in mind and a good you know motivation or angle that you can actually look into make it tangible you know sometimes we got end goals that we never actually take into practice something that really does you know show how much practice you've had is and and it's not for i'm kind of generalizing here but obviously you know the amount of money that you can earn on a job really kind of objectifies the way that like your skill it makes your skill objective right so the better programmer you are the more you're going to earn so this is an example that we decided to just pull up out of indeed.com and it shows the actual frontend junior frontend developer salaries in the united states and it's actually higher than this in a lot of different um what's it called states like california is a little bit higher but overall in the country this is you know what you earn going in as a frontend developer a junior one exactly and also uh what when people see that name saying united states they think like okay so since it's in the united states you might not get paid as that much in countries like india or you know in uk or countries in africa like they might think that they might not get the same pay but the thing is with the current trends like with the kobe 19 it's everything is remote work right so literally you can work for a u.s company from staying in india or staying in the africa africa you know like right now i'm in sri lanka and i'm working with clever program which is in the us right so that is possible guys so don't think that when it says it's united states it does not mean kind of like it's only based in the u.s but remote work also pays you the same amount of money you know man and also like when kazi says like it's money you know yeah yeah man i love that perspective that is so true and you know guys it is it is true the world is very global right now in this moment because tech is that advanced but even like amanda said right now you know the whole hovid thing happening everybody's working remotely we actually are going to have a student for one of our personal mentorships um to become a pro uh he wants to become a junior developer and we're going to help him just do that specifically you know he's going to work hand in hand with causing the whole clever programmer team and he is from east africa he's from east africa yeah that's awesome yeah yeah and it's amazing man so this kid was able to pay the mentorship and he's actually working for a firm in new york so it is very true we live in a time right now where you can actually get jobs anywhere and yeah amanath has actually been working with us for for quite a few months now and man this guy was giving so much value that it would be hard for us not to get him as a company as you know as a company and him working with us being part of the team and everything so that's just an example of how perseverance really does help you a lot in life and even dictates even more than where you're coming from so moving forward with this you know if you do want to become a an actual web developer or earn six figures with javascript we have one of the most amazing resources right there right now on the web and it is called profit with javascript and profit with javascript is of course where sunny being the main instructor of the course teach you just you know from the fundamentals to advanced javascript ultimately you know to help you build your portfolio help you build those skills because nobody can take those skills away from you and then land a job which would be pretty much i mean a lot of people's and go please people do not be spending the chat spamming it because i will have to block you let's keep it very clean here because everybody's trying to learn trying to bounce back ideas and get some great insights from this so moving on with this you want to explain this a little bit among us yeah exactly uh so to learn web development there are like you have to learn the foundation with the foundation there are stuff that you must know like the tools or it's kind of like the advance that you have for a developer so number one we have vs code so vs code is where you're going to be doing all the coding stuff so that is vs code and then we have git get is where you like store all your records it's kind of like a time machine and you can call it doctor strange of developers you know when you make a mistake when you make a mistake or you break your code git is there to save you like go back in time and you know that's what git does and then we have firebase which is really really powerful in like it allows you to do hosting it allows you you to have databases many uh no sql databases so it's really powerful and that's what we're using for almost every build that we're doing on youtube and then we have github github is an online code repo hosting repository that is like you upload your code that you're working locally on your computer online so you can collaborate with people from different parts of the world or even different parts of your company so that is github and then we have postman so postman is kind of like a backend kind of like stuff that does uh uses uh what do you say uh it takes api calls and gets the data from the api so that's what postman does so suppose you're working with a weather app with react and you want to extract with the data what you do you use postman and extract all those data from an api so that that's what you use postman for so with all the basics like html css javascript react these are literally the really most important tools that you need to know as a developer definitely guys so don't sleep on them it's one of their one of the most used vs code being one of the most popular ids right now in the world firebase being a heavy heavy hitter right now in no sql databases and just you know nonserver databases um postman is awesome to test out like ah monoth just said uh you know the api calls github now owned by microsoft is a huge git repository in git is the way that you version control the code so moving forward just going a little bit deeper into these specific tools you know one of the big tools that you're gonna have to use is an ide and id pretty much you know these are actual these actually are text editors most of them you know they're not really they're not really ides but the thing is nowadays we don't really need an ide you know we don't really need these huge clunky softwares like netbeans and eclipse and you know even even jet brains the what's it called huh it's called webstone and also pycharm and python too yeah exactly all of those are heavy heavy heavy bs code is so light it's no wonder it's also owned by microsoft so microsoft is not sleeping in the coding industry these guys are buying everything that they can it's actually developed by them so vs code is definitely what we use the most also like when people try to select this is kind of like really crazy because people always kind of find a way to bring kind of like an argument when you're selecting something like even when you're selecting react view angular you always have a fight you say one says react is better you once say angular is better once a view is better and that's kind of the same thing for this like people say no you need to have webstorm or you need to have pycharm it's not the thing guys the thing is you just have to start coding that's the most important thing so the most popular one being the vs code i think we can just all the other ideas or text editors are really great i don't disregard them like sublime text is really great like when you consider vim that's really powerful but the thing is you must settle down to one thing when you are starting at the beginning so when i say when you're beginning your journey as a developer vs code is the best and also there are things like you can add extensions and all this stuff to like power up your experience like you have tab nine that auto fills your coding and then have prettier that prettifies your code there's a lot of stuff that you can do with vs code that's not there in other text editors so if you're starting coding download bs code start coding yeah make it simple for yourself you know don't this is what people do you know they're trying to learn something and then they're like okay i need all of these tools now i have to master all of these tools then i'm going to become good at developing exactly and also like they all over complicate and think like you know i need to have a fancy computer you know i need to have all this fancy lighting i need to have all these fancy softwares to start developing that's not it and you have to check your mind because when you do that for developing then you do that for everything else then you start making excuses for everything exactly seriously yeah like when i began my journey i was like thinking wait i need to have a really powerful computer i need to really have something like this i need to have fancy keyboard and all this stuff but the real thing is you know it's not it's just you're finding yourself an excuse to just not do it you know you're logically kind of giving yourself an explanation or justification of why you cannot start doing you know start coding right now pretty much exactly and the reason i started in april it's kind of i i just really love to share this is like i saw an instagram post that literally said like if you don't come out of this quarantine or this lockdown without a new skill or without a side hustle started oh i've seen those i've seen those memes and just like motivational quotes and everything what they say is if you don't come out with a side hustle or a new skill you didn't lack time you lack discipline you know so that really hit me so hard that made me think okay seriously this is so true that we have a lot of time right now that we are not just finding excuses so that's what really motivated me to just start coding you know that's amazing man something that i see in you is like you are such a hard worker and also you're very focused so you do give a lot of good you know energy to your time and your focus so if you're doing something you're actually doing that and that's what i see a lot with people that just procrastinate a lot they always leave things for later and even if they're doing things right now they're not here now so that's really really bad and it's amazing the to see your growth man and soul mates growth in so little time and i think that can serve as inspiration so going back to the presentation here you know stop making excuses vs code download that start coding right now and also vs code is cool because it has a huge community and i actually forgot to mention this but we did get a donation it's amazing let me actually see if i can zoom into this so it's a little bit blurry so shashank mv thank you so much man really really appreciate it 40 indian rupees whoa let's get it first donation of the day guys thank you so much he says hi how do i become a writer on the cp medium that's awesome man if you guys don't know we are actually dropping amazing articles right now on medium and they begin they're getting thousands and thousands of hits guys and if you're a good reader go check it out for sure yep some people don't like to watch videos some people like to read and what type of articles do we have on medium right now amano so right now we have uploaded the amazon clone we have the spotify clone we have the airbnb club we have we are literally doing the same thing that we do on youtube in written medium so if you are like you cannot uh spend hours and hours on a video and just coding it out what you can do go check out our medium just go medium.com cleverprogrammer and you find all the articles for the clones that we're doing so also we have a lot of motivational articles and like how you should start coding and a lot of stuff so do check that out for sure guys that's awesome let me see if i can write it here for them so it's gonna be oh yeah it's gonna be cleverprogrammer.com so guys this is the link if you guys want to check out the actual articles i'm gonna make it bigger for you guys if you guys want to check out the articles club

everything so make sure to give a clap i know we lingered a little bit more on the tools of visual studio code and everything but i think it's good you know giving you guys a little bit of context and also we are at 230 likes right now amanath and that's insane that's awesome thank you guys so much if you guys are enjoying this content what should they do amanda just smash that like button and if you haven't subscribed it hopefully you will have subscribed just subscribe and also don't forget to share this video with your friends and family or people who might be thinking to start to learn coding because literally this is the best place you know to be yep yep make errors um find guidance and start to start so if you want to start what language should i learn first this is cool and we actually while we were working on this presentation and we really wanted to make it so that you guys are able to understand and pick up you know what what is the fundamentals what is the foundation of web development in general and what is it so the reason also i just want to say the reason that we're doing this video like there might be people who have already built all these clones and stuff i might be thinking why are we doing a really basic one today the reason is that we saw a lot of people who are coming without a basic knowledge trying to do the react clones and they don't find a lot of good guidance so that is the main reason that we are doing this video so if you have had troubles working on the clones this is the best video that you can watch and learn from this and start applying i'm working i'm putting in all those work okay guys so back to the slides so like if you were yeah sorry no mind took you off but if you want to learn the foundation that's the first step right that's where you start so that you can go into react and build those projects so this is what we want to dive into and the foundations pretty much are going to be html css and javascript now amanoth can you give them an example of how html works and what is all the exactly so html and css are not programming languages guys so they're just markup language and a style sheet not a programming language okay and also i've seen some of my students getting confused because the thing is when they start with html css it just goes really smooth and when they come to javascript and they say oh no i just learned html css it was so easy but when i started javascript it was really hard because yeah the thing is html css is pretty much nothing but javascript is programming language what it's kind of like you trying to talk to a computer and make him understand right so that is javascript and that's why it's harder than html and css yeah html is actually html and css are actually in my opinion very like human they're kind of very human languages to understand javascript is a little bit less it's not as bad as java you know or maybe c plus plus or something like that but it's way better than them exactly so this is an actual example of how html code looks and also the formatting and everything and how it actually looks on the websites so i know there's a bunch of movement going on there's a bunch of arrows pointing everywhere but tell us how this works so you can see the h2 is like the tag that we use in html so these are all tags and within them we type in the text this is uh if you can if you if you guys are really old and have seen really old websites like the old professor kind of website yeah now you're just bragging that you're that yeah that's that's cool yeah that's true it's like early 2000 websites were so simple they used like they kind of looked like this a lot of schools websites look like this that's why you know if you're if you're a student it's good to get your school as a client because normally their websites suck and that's what we've seen a lot right so right here um li pretty much just means list um i believe this is is this no this is just list on order list and this is how it actually manifests here so it shows the bullets i like apples i like apples oranges and then oranges and then if you do want to add an image you put image storage source which is pretty selfexplanatory this is the url of the image and here's the image on the website this is the width it's kind of like just quoted up to me like i like apples oranges are just okay for me but my favorite is pineapple bro is that true maybe you made this bro who knows uh and by the way we got this from a cool youtube video which we were heavily based on you guys should check it out it has the same title but 2020 and it's cool you know it's good to get um inspiration from different places i feel like that video really did explain things very well and so that's where i got this specific screenshot so shout out to them i don't remember who the actual creator is coda coder nice check them out thank you thank you so much for that so what about css so css it's the style sheet so what you do you have you create this button on html and you see it's really lame you don't have a lot of style on anything so what you do you use css you color it give it a border you give it a width you give it a height and you know it says it gives all the look and feel it's kind of like the makeup you know yep for your website so that's css yeah css is cool i remember one of my teachers in college um he spoke about css as being yeah the stylizing of the web but also the color also the shapes what you see visually so a website with html looks like this as you can see there's no color there's no sections there's no separations there's no effects there's nothing that's html css is where it actually becomes colorful and the way to do that is if you want to get a little bit more advanced into css obviously you know the foundations would be like we just explained here these three but going into the middle one css you know foundation i'm sorry um frameworks of that some of them could be you know css grids another one would be css flexbox another one would be actually bootstrap so here's the frameworks some of them are libraries as well but you know the cool thing about them is that for example if you're building a website and you're building just any modern responsive website most websites have very a lot of similarities and designs so you're gonna find whether that's big photos that have you know a slight show or anything like that maybe a video slideshow maybe just you know grids of actual items that they're selling things of the sort all of these things are already created for you right so in development i think if you're just starting out you have to understand that one of the biggest things for you is to become resourceful and looking for these type of libraries like css flexbox grids bootstrap material ui all of these is going to help you one become resourceful two learn how to use different tools and then three use things that people have already done so don't start don't quote from scratch guys that's really really big you want to mention something on this i wanna play yeah so it's kind of like you don't need to have a lot of code to become a better programmer you must be resourceful like i've seen people like you know no i don't need to use all this stuff i need to code all this stuff it just only takes time but it's really it's it can be also annoying like when you find a bug it's going to take a long time for you to do so when you're starting out you don't always need to do everything from scratch always be resourceful like css flexbox is really great also if you want to uh practice on flexbox go to flexboxfroggy.com so flexboxfroggy.com is kind of like an interactive game where you where it's 25 levels you can practice flexbox and also css grids it's kind of a is it like this xbox.com exactly yeah so css great it's kind of like flexbox on steroids like it's kind of like the next level of css screen so it's a bit harder than css flexbox but it's also a really good thing i mean a really good concept to learn and apply in your websites and other than that there are boots uh css frameworks that you can learn like bootstrap material ui bulma material material lies there's a lot the best and the most popular one is bootstrap so if you're starting out i'd say the best uh advice is learn css and then go for bootstrap or other css frameworks of your preference you know yep bootstrap is the best yeah bootstrap is the most famous framework for css in the world not kidding about that so the only fundamental that is left now would be javascript and exactly what is javascript man what is javascript how do you use javascript how do you use it what is it used for so javascript is what creates the functionality of a website like you click this page i mean you click this button and suddenly a popup comes out or it asks for something from you there's a lot everything like all the interaction is because of javascript i think we have that gif right after this slide right bro that's very funny one so this is an example of javascript code but i did want to mention um javascript is is amazing because yeah like uh amano was just saying it's the functionality it's like that it's it's like the 3d dimension of coding of web websites if i can say so because you know html and css are pretty they're just designed they're just text there's their way to stylize and share information javascript it's what is what it's like if that's length and width but oh you can't say it as the nervous system like you can have a body you can have a skeleton you can have a body if you don't have a nervous system your body does not work so javascript is the nervous system of a website whoa that's a beautiful way to put it yep yep it's what connects everything pretty much it moves everything so okay this is an example of a javascript code and it kind of it's funny because everybody was actually they thought about javascript as it not being it was a joke in the beginning i remember it was a joke people didn't take it too seriously and this was like 2010 and stuff and then everything started changing when it became super strong so now it even has a little bit of backend with node.js now you can pretty much do everything with web development and this is a great example of what you can do with these fundamentals that we just taught you so you want to explain a little bit about this yeah like you say students who get bullied at school when they are young are the ones who shine very well at the end right so javascript got bullied and it started shining really well so html gives the skeleton for your website like what you saw it's really name you don't you know you don't see uh beauty in a skeleton right that's how the same when you have pure hdmi oh wow that's a great bro i love all your freaking metaphors they're amazing and by the way don't mean to cut you off but we just crossed the 300 likes on this video guys thank you guys so much so much we're at 309 let's get it to 350 guys that would be amazing but don't mean to cut you off man you were saying skeletons are not that beautiful so html whoops kind of resembles that right yep exactly and then what you do you add a skin you add some makeup and you get css so css is kind of like the skin for your website like it gives colors it gives you a nice appearance it gives all the width and height for the buttons and all those stuff you know it just gives a beauty and then you have javascript it just goes crazy that's what javascript does javascript just dances so you know let's say that you have a button in your website and you want that button to open up a link you want that button to do something specific to hide a column anything like that all of that action that's being taken is going to be actually directed by javascript so javascript right over here to do a dance like that yeah yeah yeah that's why he loves javascript you know that's why nas is the main instructor because he dances just like this meme so javascript is the functionality of websites and all of these things put together are pretty much the foundation of web development you need to learn this first before going into any framework any library just make sure you you learn you understand vanilla javascript you understand these type of basics of html and css and libraries for css that's it guys it's not that complicated so when you say javascript it just pure javascript exactly that's that's why they call it vanilla because javascript like i said it was it was um what's that word it's it was kind of like an underdog in programming languages but as soon as it started getting super powerful then you started to be able to do anything with it the thing is there's so much to do with javascript it gets very confusing so what you want to do is make it simple for you learn the foundations and learning the foundations of javascript is called vanilla javascript which is just you know plain old javascript from there you go to frameworks like react angular view all of these so do you want to explain a little bit about this um yes front end back end full stack so that's what's like kind of like the second level when you start learning the basics and then people ask okay so you have learned the basics what's your aim is a frontend backend or full stack so for now if you're just beginning out just ignore full step for a while okay and focus on front end or either backhand so if you're kind of like a really creative guy you know about colors like frankie you know he loves colors and all this stuff so if you are really creative go with front end and also if you are kind of like logic and you know things like cozy go with backhand that's why he chose python so but now you can choose you don't really need to know python for backend you can learn javascript and learn node.js and use node.js as the backend right and also another thing is i really like to make it as known is even if you're not creative you can build a creative mind like considering myself i was literally the designs that i'm making right now i just cannot believe because the thing is the more you expose yourself to design and all this stuff yeah you start building those skills it's kind of not a talent it's kind of like a skill you know that's true you can build creativity that's awesome man i i would think that you were very creative actually because of i've seen your designs and i myself love design so you know originally originally as i was studying computer science i wanted to become i i knew that i want to do something visual with it first it was a mobile developer so i was like okay dope i'm going to become an android developer because i want to see the things that i create i want to see them on my phone i want to be able to touch them i want to be able to interact with them and i want other people to see it then after that i was like okay like android is kind of dying but not really like still in the world a lot of people use android but i started using apple and i started falling in love with swift and i'm like cool mobile development is oh so awesome but then i kind of started to fall a little bit more in love with design which i wanted to go into ui and ux design i think it's very important as amanoth was saying right now you know front end is more for people that are a little bit more visual don't let you know if you are very analytical and stuff don't let that dis discourage you from from learning it but front end is regularly visual in what you see on the browser backhand also front end is seriously really important as backend because the thing is you can have a really good backend and have all this functionality and finally if it looks like a lame website where you don't know how things interact and all this stuff it's just going to be a waste so future front end back and both are really really important so yep i would even say i mean both are very important yeah i would even say front and is a little bit more important i know i'm gonna get hate for that but i do really think that because for example if you didn't like the way that instagram looks if you didn't like the way that facebook looks you would never use it if you don't like the way youtube works and how efficient it is how it looks you would never use it so run in is sometimes even more important in the back end even though both and also they won't even be watching this exactly yep exactly it wasn't like it is right now so you know going into the front end part of this teaching you know these are some of the most popular frontend frameworks out there right now it's they're huge so you want to mention a few of them so it's wartime it's wartime yeah because people literally fight a lot right yeah view you know they fight a lot so if you're a beginner just ignore the ignore angular and view first for a set for the time being and focus on react because react it's not because we do a lot of videos on react it's because react is really easy and it's also really lightweight because it's not a framework it's a library right so if you are beginning first learn the basics and learn basics of javascript kind of like functions and how all this stuff works and then go with react you know and the best way to learn is building projects so you can build projects like that we have the netflix clone the hulu clone the airbnb if you have all this stuff so you can learn react just by literally watching all these clones you know you have all this stuff so yeah man react is amazing because it's the next step if you did learn vanilla javascript what's cool about this is that damn you get to realize how much tech companies how much influence they have on the coding space obviously so react was made by facebook it's what they currently use uh javascript library framework that they use angular is made by google it's funny because vue was made by uh an angular developer so you know it's both of these are pretty much google and this one is facebook and they're the one of the most um you know famous frameworks for front end and javascript in general and as amanda was saying right now the best way to learn react right now in my opinion in youtube at least is go to our youtube channel and check out all of these amazing projects that we've built so you know what are some of these projects among us so we have starting with the todo list which is the most basic one we have the netflix clone the instagram clone the really really advanced at the most amazing amazon clone we have tinder hulu kobe tracker we have almost i think 20 clones yep yep or even more man i don't know yeah like once you kind of like finished with all these loans you're gonna be the react god or the next papa react yeah guys seriously guys seriously if you guys are not playing and you do want to get an atlanta job as a developer you do want to up your skills as a developer you need to start working on projects and we decided as a team to work on you know let's dissect the biggest websites in the world right now the biggest websites and apps and let's show people how to build them so that they can put it on their portfolio for free and also another reason that we are doing bit the clones is because the designs have actually worked you know because you can come up with an idea from scratch that's huge the design might not work but the design of facebook the design of instagram have worked and that's why people are using it and that's why we made a clone of those so you can learn how you can build designs like that in your own projects you know yep we could have easily said okay let's let's teach them how to create a website with a database that pulls out movies and then maybe even place trailers okay we can do a tutorial like that or we can just build netflix because netflix already put in so much so many millions and millions of dollars into testing their ui testing how their customers interact with the whole website so just model these huge companies that have already tested out these things that's the best way for you to learn the best way for you to integrate you know things that are efficient and effective and not just be so hardheaded and thinking like oh okay this design like a monolith just saying this design i think it's gonna work because i really like blue and i really like squares no bro that's not how the world works you know actually model things that work and also the thing is we students have landed jobs just by doing these clones like frank ramos did the spotify clone and landed a job at sonos which is the biggest u.s audio company and then we have jen who landed a job like twice the amount of salary she has yes she was earning just by betting tracker i think she was earning yeah 46 000 and then she started um earning 96 000 after joining profit with javascript and also building this specific video literally this video got her a 96 thousand dollar job she put this she finished it put her on a portfolio and she got a job after losing her job in covid which is an amazing amazing story so yeah guys don't sleep on it pay attention to this actual content we're putting out it is real world so take it into practice now going a little bit deeper into the other side of web development which would be backend frameworks i know it's a little bit it's a little bit blurry guys so bear with us so you know these are the differences of 2018 and 2019 some of the biggest languages out there so off the bat you can see that one of the biggest frameworks right now sorry i said languages but it's frameworks some of the biggest frameworks right now on um what's it called backend is going to be node.js made by javascript different uh javascript framework benefit is the benefit of learning node.js is because you just only have to learn one language you know like suppose you are front like if you go back about 10 or 15 years back you didn't have node.js and the thing is you have to learn html says as javascript for the front end and then you gotta have to learn something like python or java or dotnet to build the back end but now the benefit is you just have to learn the same language to do the do both you know exactly exactly and node.js a lot of people are liking it right now community big communities being built up it's really popping it's really in you know it's it's it's like the new generation of backend languages or frameworks sorry so angular was pretty big on 2018 then it took a little bit of a dive in 2019 and net went up so pandas which would be every python then react native is another you know javascript framework so all of these are the the famous one django you can see spring is a javascript as a java framework i believe yeah yeah tensorflow it's also ai and python xamarin is a hybrid there's a lot yeah it's a hybrid of um it's it's hybrid development just like react native anyways so these are all examples of back end one of the biggest most popular backend framework right now is what amana the one but this just came up and praveen i actually came up like two minutes ago i forgot to pull it up but praveen uh donated had a donation of 20 indian rupees thank you so much man we really really appreciate that i love you guys love the cp fam i think that deserves a dj airhorn let's go thank you guys so much we love you we are at 277 likes that is amazing guys let's keep the energy up we're about to finish this presentation and you're going to take home some amazing knowledge that amanoth and i am dropping right now we were hitting on the merge stack so burn is one of the most popular backend frameworks like amano was saying and what else so we can say it's not kind of like back in framework it's kind of like this combination of frameworks yeah combination of frameworks that you use to create a full stack application so we have mongodb which is a nosql database we have express js we have react as the frontend framework and then we have node.js as the backend framework a combination of the all of this can help you build a full stack application the thing is while we were building the react clones we built the same clones in one so once you have mastered react you can go do the same clone with one stack and learn all four of these technologies you know so you're going to become dr moon like david says yeah so these are actually all of the videos that amano was talking about right now we got the whatsapp mern clone we got the instagrammer and clone the tindermern clone and the tiktok merlin clone learn how to build these put them in your portfolio they're actually so useful for you to get a job people have already gotten them like we were saying thing about this and mern stack is that if you want to become very knowledgeable and you want to come you want to become a full stack developer this is one of the stacks that most people are using mongodb express react and nodejs as we were mentioning node.js is one of the biggest frameworks for backend right now react is one of the biggest frameworks in front end right now mongodb is one of the most famous and used nosql databases out there and then express what is express i don't know what expresses do you know express it is called the run time and i think yeah it's kind of like the onetime involvement you create to run the application i see it like i know it's kind of like a server kind of thing okay so it's express js nice beautiful so all of these things are super in right now so learn the merge stack these are some of the resources that we provided for you guys maybe take a screenshot of this we think youtube might be one of the best one and it's also free so what's better than free knowledge education that can actually up every single different stage of your life every part of your life you know from your monetary to your knowledge to your relationships learn it from youtube and honestly anything free so what are other learning resources man then we have free code cam so you go to freecodecam.org it's kind of like a modularbased lessons you get modularbased lessons with quizzes exercises that you can work on so just go to freecodecam.org and you can pretty much learn the whole web development i mean learn for development and then we have frontier mentor so frontend mentor is a really great place where you can practice what you've learned so that is what i did like i what i've asked my brother it's kind of like a challenge that i'm doing with my brother is he learns all this stuff and then i ask him sorry oh my my own brother yeah how old is he um he's 15 i guess yeah 15. nice and you do a challenge with him yeah so i just want to inspire him and he is taking challenges from frontal mentor and he's killing it and he's doing all those projects you know like i gave him a challenge to do a slack clone i mean the slack landing page and he just did uh the same exact web page you know wow that's crazy man and at 15 wow like these things are not even taught in school that's the cool thing about it like it's actual practical real world knowledge no excuses guys you have all these free resources and just the thing is you just gotta do it you know the only thing stopping you is just doing it so front end mentor you get challenges like they give you a landing page and what you've got to do is just recreate the same page from code so that's a really way to practice what you've learned then we have w3schools and mdm web docs it's kind of like the documentation for html css and javascript and htmlreference.io and cssreference.io is also kind of like the same and also two resources that i'd like to add to this is one is called reactive flux so i think if you can type it out that would be great a frankie so it's called reactive flux give me one second so yeah let's put it here react t flux t i t i no uh it's just one t sorry t i f l u x so reactive flux is a discharge yeah reactive flux is a discord server where you have around 150 000 react developers and also i got stuck in an error when i was working with react and i just dropped only one message and people started helping me helping me because the most important thing when you're learning to code is having a community like the clever programmer community the best coding community you can find in the world so if you try if you cannot afford like pwj or thing you have a lot of stuff you can learn from you know no no excuses so check out reactive lux and the other website is called react resources dot com and you can literally find resources free resources to learn anything in react so reactive flux and react resources dot com ah a bonus if you have been watching around till now nice those are amazing man and it's great that they have helped you personally i do want to mention that somebody just gave one another donation man it's insane people are going crazy this is insane let me actually make it bigger for you guys um here we go so i think i have to like this to share it oh man i lost it so anyways let me take another screenshot of it really fast because we're really grateful for the people that do take their time to donate man because you know it doesn't matter the amount what matters is really the intent and we're all here to learn if somebody can you know do put more wood into the fire that's that's amazing man and harsha modini says what are your thoughts on flutter one languages three os on floater one languages three os i don't understand the question completely um i think he's asking about flutter so flutter is mainly for web i mean application android application and ios application developer so what you can instead of your flutter you can learn react native so it's kind of gonna become a whole package for you like you know how to create web applications plus mobile applications which is really valuable you know like if you learn proper you can only be developing mobile applications but if you learn react and react native you can do both yep that's a great way to look at it man flutter is the framework for the language start and dart is made by google so flutter is cool because it's it's google's response to facebook response to hybrid development which is pretty much you know making an app that works pretty much everywhere uh android and then also ios and then also web development pretty much so and also another advice is like the thing is most people is kind of like they say what what if i do flutter what if i do react what if i do this what if i do it's not the thing you just do it if you think okay i need to do flutter just dive in try one one or two months into it and see if it's gonna work for you if it does not it's just not a waste of time you just learned a lesson you know exactly exactly just just test it out test it out that's it that's today's model pretty much just test things out don't take anything for granted um don't give too many too much spice space or time two things and you know we were speaking about a lot of resources right now we think one of the best resources in the world as a developer would be definitely google yep yeah man it's funny that's how you learn everything you know that's how you answer all of your questions as developers and a little bit ago i was just mentioning that you have to be resourceful and big big big portion of the development jobs have to do with researching and pretty much googling things man because most people have already stumbled upon you know the bugs that you have stumbled upon your code so there's a lot of forums like stack overflow there's a bunch of you know different resources in the web right now that can actually help you out with your problems so this is a funny meme that we found and it says when you start working as a programmer how to get date in c plus right and then 10 years of experience later you're still in google and literally googling the same thing the thing is if you can't remember thing it's not it's not the motive of programming you know the motive of programming is just creating solutions to problem it does not mean like you need to remember how to create a dictionary python or how to create a function in python it's not the motive the motive of programming is to create solutions to problems so if you can't remember that's completely okay it's completely fine you know you have google as a savior yep you don't have to code things from scratch guys most of the advanced developers that i know always are googling stuff and even code faster than people that are coding from scratch it just doesn't make sense so people and this meme right here says not sure if i'm a good developer i'm good at googling it's pretty much the same thing man it's pretty much the same thing now at this point and i'll take off that image so you guys can see it but moving forward you know one of the big things about resources is that you know resources help you learn but ultimately what's going to help you learn the most is choosing a project to work with just like omanath was just saying some of the projects that we've built for you guys are already on our youtube channel they're free for you to see you can put them on your portfolio maybe even land a job like most of you know a lot of our students have and this is one example of the websites that we build you want to add something to this so this is the netflix club right so choose a project just work on it you know and also a threestep strategy that i use is when you're working first time on a project i mean like when you're watching a tutorial and doing it just watch the tutorial and just code the thing up and make it working you know so that's one accomplishment and the second time what you do is you don't watch the video you start on your own like you got the idea of how the project is done right so what you do you start coding on your own and when you get stuck you refer the video or the tutorial of the article that you did and the third time what you do you don't literally don't have access to the tutorial or the article or anything just start coding it up and when you find yourself stuck what you do just google it like how can i create the date picker or how do i create this component or how do i style this component just google it and try to build it on your own that way it's going to concrete the knowledge in you you know like you it's kind of like you go from beginner level to an advanced level one project like to learn because the reason why people are stuck in tutorial hello anything just they just copy paste code or kind of like just see okay so he's having use effect over there i'm just typing it there so you don't literally understand why you use use effect over there why do you use the remove event listener why do you use the this device use that div and all this stuff you know yeah man i completely completely agree it's a difference between taking in information and making your information practical that's it it's like you can get information for the rest of your life but if you never practice it then the map is not the same as the territory like people say you know a map is just uh it's just a symbol or representation of the territory that it's mapping out right so it's not the same thing and put it into practice guys don't lose your time this is another example of one of the builds that we made one of the most one of the famous videos that we released actually one of the most popin ones and it's the amazon project in this amazon project we did it two ways we did it with react and firebase and we also did it in the mern stack with which uses mongodb if you guys want to learn how to build that this is amazing it's a full ecommerce functionality website and we show you step by step not only do we show you step by step but we even make it cool we make it fun for you guys it's not like we're gonna sit down and just program right exactly man it we make it fun you know it's that's the thing and that's the whole point of clever programmer really programming can be fun it doesn't always have to be depressive boring and stale so programming is fun so yeah man i want to describe this a little bit because amano actually does a bunch most of the posts and use of two that we release on instagram our instagram has been growing like crazy if you do enjoy this content make sure to follow clever quasi so that you can follow the clever programmer instagram so you want to go a little bit deep into this honor yeah so tutorial or tutorial purgatory which is really common with wannabe developers you know who just dive into coding the reason why you are in tutorial health so before what why you are here what is it it's kind of like you feeling yourself that you are not making progress and you're kind of stuck inside a loop of watching tutorials again and again and again so how can i escape tutorial help right so uh frank you can't just go to the next slide bro cool i was just seeing that people are saying that there's an echo can you guys hear an echo drop it in the comments if you hear an echo i don't hear one but okay cool so what is tutorial hell so you follow along the tutorial and understand everything they do and you do create what they do by coding along but you cannot create things on your own oracle and rely on tutorials for everything yep that's what you were just mentioning exactly so the reasons you're stuck is you find it easy to just keep following tutorials because when you try to code things up on your own you find it really hard because it's just the beginning guys you know you cannot become the greatest developer in just two months that's not how it works just gotta put in the work you gotta put in the motions you gotta put in the dedication and all the all this stuff to become a great developer so the reason is you find it easy to just follow all the tutorials and the second thing when you follow tutorials and you build projects just watching the tutorials it gives you a sense that you're making progress and the second thing is why you don't want to come out of tutorials is because you feel yourself as insecure when you come out of a tutorial you know yeah i think very bad sound quality let me say very bad sound quality is that better guys tell us if that's better i think they said that there was an echo but you know tutorial hell is actually um give me one sec so somebody says yes no change cool so tutorial hell is actually interesting because a lot of people find themselves there it's actually kind of like one of the stages of growth to be honest with you and people find it easy so that you know you follow the tutorial copy paste the code and they think that they're getting they think that they're actually getting um what's it called advanced progress exactly progress and they're not directly and also another thing is i like to say is tutorial hell is kind of like the word depression you know like when people bit sad they say oh no i got depression and like when new wannabe developers just get into coding they say you know what i got stuck in tutorial hell it's kind of like a what do you say a fashion you know to say or kind of like a trend yeah you know you say oh man you know i'm stuck in tutorial hell you know yeah yeah it's kind of like looks cool when you're saying those stuff you know exactly yeah now people started rocking it like they own it so that's it's good and it's bad at the same time so you know starting off with code at the end of the day practicing code is what's going to make you a better developer not anything else so people do ask this question a lot and the question is how long should i code every day and amano has made a really cool diagram for you guys that i think can be very practical if you take it into practice and this will greatly massively improve your coding so this is the 30minute rule you want to explain a little bit about that man yep so the thing is there are people who might be going for work and doing jobs and all this stuff and they might not find enough time to do coding so if you are really into it the best way to start is doing 30 minutes every day you know if you don't have literally no time just start doing by 30 minutes every day and those 30 minutes will add up to how many hours per week or three and a half hours so it's half hours per week you know one two three four five six seven okay so when you add all these up it comes up to 168 hours of coding per year you know it's kind of like the amount of the hours of coding that uh a cs graduate does right yep frankie yeah yeah yeah um i don't know exactly how many hours a cs graduate um does code honestly i would say it's it's a little bit more than this i would say more than 168. in my years of um of college i'd say a little bit more than 168 honestly but dude if you quote for 168 hours a year like you're just gonna be a beast you're gonna be a beast and it's not it's not even about guys really do take this into account i'm going to be very serious with you i know we were having a lot of fun but this is serious if you are going to put in 30 minutes a day like we're saying it's not about putting in 30 minutes a day it's the quality of the practice that you do you can literally spend 30 minutes doing doing nothing learning from the worst resources ever and you're not going to get anywhere it's not about putting in the 30 minutes it's about the quality that you put in those 30 minutes practice perfect practice makes perfect what is it perfect practice makes perfect it's not just practice okay so make sure to to get the good resources and put in the time also and also like you finding an excuse to say you don't have 13 minutes it's just you know like you can go on instagram and just go on instagram for 30 minutes you know you don't feel that time but if you can just put those 30 minutes into coding without you knowingly you're going to code for 168 hours in just a year you know and you're going to become a beast yeah man you spend freaking 30 minutes a day just coat just literally scrolling through instagram literally like not doing anything anything like that bro like just allocate your time a little bit better and be responsible that's it so that was how to code how much you should code every day check out the instagram if you to go if you guys want to see more diagrams like that amanov and yusuf are dropping really far once every single day to so check them out so amanda's was showing me this specific website and i think it's really amazing man we were talking about different roadmaps or careers that you can take with um with just you know web development in general so this is the website and let's actually go to it yeah for sure bro cool so it's what is it called man it's called roadmap.sh make it bigger for you guys so you guys can see let's see does that look good okay i think that's great awesome yeah perfect so yep it's uh roadmap.sh we'll try to put these links in the description below guys and this is kind of how it looks so it's a different developer roadmap so off the bat here you can check out and you can see that there's front end there's back end there's devops there's react there's android postgres a little bit more back end devops yeah also if you can just go to the front and we can show people how you know what the format is yep and that's the cool thing about this website is if you want to learn a little bit more about front end it's going to tell you the road map to it like right here so from the developer then the internet how the internet works how the websites work how everything is connected together and yeah man it's it's it's it gets very complex if you do insane if you do follow it man it's it's really going to help you understand you know how everything is connected what part of the journey each thing is in like here you can see bootstrap you know the css libraries that we were just mentioning or frameworks and you know how progressive web apps are connected to whether that's actually the map only just looks so complicated but the thing is via actually when you're using react it's already progressive with maps you know and also it's just simple stuff that you just over complicate the map just shows you the road map but it's not as complicated as it looks you know yeah take it step by step you know learn to digest it put a little bit of time into it just go through it so that it makes sense so that's the front end roadmap this is the back end roadmap and it starts off the same you know showing the internet what is http all these you know secure type of um verifications the domains dns how all of that is connected no sql databases also i think when they say about like you know always and general knowledge i think seriously it's kind of like more technical stuff but if you're just starting out i don't think like you nee you need to have a basic knowledge of how internet works and all this stuff but i don't think like you need to go really deep into all those stuff you know yep i agree man don't go so deep into you know learning how a computer works like how all of these things work most computer science students they make them go through that route i think it's beautiful to learn those things but if you really want to get you know the skills you really want to get the career you really want to get the money and the actual knowledge guys make it practical actually drop the complex complexity like if you make it simple it's going to be easier for you to start it's going to be easy for you to actually put you know things into practice guys so let's go a little bit into android these are all the different road maps guys you know check them out i don't think you should delve so deep into them but there's so many different ways that you can tackle this whoops so i'm going back to it again but going back to the presentation so these are the career paths and honestly guys there's so much to do we do want to wrap up because we've been talking about for about an hour we're gonna you know save you guys his time anything that you want to mention at this point among us so yeah my drop yeah like obama yep oh you cannot drop that mic yeah boom let's try this let's go i'm kidding but yeah so yeah that guy's guys go ahead man take action start coding and also hit me up at um wait is it where like this yep it's right there come on and just wait can i touch it yeah you're go a little bit down right there right there right there oh yeah oh yes quickly so hit me up at amanda.dev and yeah if you have any questions just feel free to reach out to me on instagram yeah i'll be glad to help you guys so yeah guys hit us up on instagram amano has amazing knowledge he's killing it for our instagram and he's also bringing so much knowledge to the whole community we want to wrap this up guys thank you guys so much this is pretty much going to be you know the road map that you should take if you are uh an absolute beginner in web development you want to get an idea what to do hopefully you had fun hopefully you get you got good resources off of this hopefully you also got a good mindset off of this that i know amanov has and i have been working on it as well it's a big part of being a developer it's not all just technicalities it's also psychology so don't forget to take that into account now before we do leave i want to say that if you are serious about becoming a sixfigure javascript developer we do have the training for you and this training cause you put a lot of hard work and love into it so if you're serious guys please please please go into the description below because i really care about you guys future if you guys are serious about it you know if you're not serious nobody's going to be serious for you so these top three mistakes that you should avoid when becoming a javascript developer training i think is amazing man it's going to give you a lot of context onto what to do next how to earn money from it how to become a six figure developer so go ahead and click the link in the description below to check that out and in that training you're going to see how to join profit with javascript as well because profitable javascript might be one of the best resources or actual i was i wasn't showing the screen i thought it was but profit javascript is one of the best resources out there so that you can pick up javascript and make money from it so we're not all about the theory we're actually all about the practicality so practicality is what's going to make you money what's going to build your skill and here's the top three
