00:24 - to order some food okay
00:25 - right i like to order some food so this
00:27 - he's the website so
00:28 - what happens here is he is the front end

00:51 - listen closely listen closely i got this
00:53 - other guy right here
00:54 - right here okay like this other guy this
00:56 - guy is the server
00:58 - okay this guy is actually the api we
01:00 - call it the backhand okay
01:02 - so what happens here now at this point
01:04 - is this is where
01:05 - he now he is the chef this guy is a chef
01:08 - he's going to make
01:09 - the food that i just ordered as the user
01:12 - right so if you think about it yeah
01:13 - keep making the food keep making the
01:14 - food yeah you know come on do your stuff
01:16 - right
01:16 - so at this point he's making the food
01:18 - but he's not making anyone just yet
01:20 - what needs to happen at this point check
01:22 - this out website
01:24 - server api all right there's some kind
01:27 - of middleware that needs to happen or
01:28 - connect communication
01:29 - between the two of them needs to happen
01:31 - in order in order for this
01:32 - for this to actually work so the
01:34 - question becomes what is that connection
01:37 - well the connection is actually
01:38 - something called an api request
01:41 - if you think about an ap api request
01:42 - it's simply just
01:44 - when a website literally calls out to
01:46 - the api
01:47 - and asks hey i would like this resource
01:51 - in this case here's what i would like to
01:52 - do i would like you to yell out
01:55 - hey i need a pizza hey i need a pizza
01:58 - great so here's what you do you just
02:00 - heard that you needed pizza okay
02:01 - what are you gonna do at this point
02:02 - pizza got it okay beautiful he's making
02:05 - the pizza he's now he's doing his thing
02:06 - you know come on look let's go he's
02:07 - doing his thing good good good good good
02:09 - he's gonna sting one minute in okay he
02:11 - made the pizza

02:24 - thank you i eat the pizza and now i got
02:26 - the pizza
02:27 - so you see this whole process my friends
02:29 - is called
02:30 - the full stack development he is an api
02:34 - he right here is the front end the
02:37 - website
02:38 - okay and they and they go ahead and talk
02:40 - to each other
02:41 - to make everything in the world wide web
02:43 - work
02:44 - but it's a very important rule this guy
02:46 - is one of the most
02:48 - important people that you don't see he's
02:50 - one of the most important things this is
02:52 - what happens on the back end so
02:53 - now for example let me give you an
02:54 - example let's say you log into facebook
02:56 - okay
02:57 - you log in you put in your personal
02:59 - information your username and password
03:01 - then it provides to you what it provides
03:03 - to you all your information about
03:05 - your photos your news feed well think
03:07 - about like this way
03:08 - where did you get all of that
03:09 - information where is that being stored
03:12 - well that is being stored on something
03:13 - that you don't know it's being stored on
03:15 - the back end
03:16 - right the logic right here right this is
03:19 - the back end
03:20 - he has all the information about you the
03:22 - photos okay
03:23 - all the logic needs to happen in terms
03:25 - of like how do you how do i log you in
03:27 - right he will log you in he will know
03:30 - what is the username password that you
03:32 - provided and what
03:34 - person you actually are so that is the
03:37 - api
03:37 - so my friends just think about that this
03:39 - way very simple api right here
03:41 - website front right here they both talk
03:43 - together to make everything
03:45 - work and that is an api hopefully
03:48 - understood that
03:49 - i'll see you guys later
