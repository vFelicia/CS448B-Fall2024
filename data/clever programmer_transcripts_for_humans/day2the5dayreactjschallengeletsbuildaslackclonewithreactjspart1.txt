11:14 - fun man i love that that's beautiful all
11:15 - right so
11:16 - really quick guys so that's it part one
11:18 - that's it now let's go straight into
11:21 - the slack clone okay let's get serious
11:24 - let's go ahead and sit down we'll quiet
11:26 - down we'll chill for a second here right
11:28 - um our goal today is to build that slack
11:31 - project now
11:31 - what are we going to be building okay
11:33 - our goal is to get to this portion right
11:34 - here you see how currently we have for
11:36 - example
11:36 - a header window we have a sidebar this
11:39 - is our goal
11:40 - for today guys okay just pretty simple
11:42 - that's me part one
11:44 - now if you think about creating any
11:45 - project guys let's just think about a
11:47 - little bit
11:47 - in a few ways okay so let me go ahead
11:49 - and zoom in here so you guys see
11:52 - when you create a project like for
11:53 - example like any website
11:55 - what do you think about daniel what do
11:57 - you think about well first when i'm
11:58 - trying to get started i want to think
12:00 - about
12:01 - what is this structure going to look
12:02 - like what are the things that i'm going
12:03 - to have to put in place
12:05 - to start to put this website correct
12:07 - right always the structure it's kind of
12:08 - like you're building guys
12:09 - you're kind of like you're building a
12:10 - building right when you build a building
12:12 - you're
12:12 - building a structure you have an
12:14 - architecture a piece of paper correct
12:16 - and that builds the structure of the
12:17 - building right i'm not doesn't build it
12:19 - but it's an architecture
12:20 - foundation so let's go and build the
12:22 - architecture right now so if you can see
12:24 - this is the slack clone now this is a
12:26 - part one of it what do you see well what
12:28 - do you see right now is pretty simple we
12:30 - have
12:30 - here a header okay right
12:34 - and this header has multiple components
12:35 - part one is a has like this for example
12:37 - this icon component right here
12:39 - it has this input right here correct for
12:42 - searching yep
12:43 - it has this question mark right here for
12:44 - a question right and it has kind of like
12:47 - a
12:48 - this kind of component for your username
12:51 - correct
12:51 - okay next on the left hand side you have
12:53 - a sidebar right here you see the sidebar
12:56 - in the sidebar you have things like some
12:58 - channels you have your workspace
13:00 - workspace name and you have your channel
13:02 - right here channel number one child
13:04 - number two and so forth yep right
13:06 - so all these things that you guys are
13:08 - seeing right here where i'm highlighting
13:10 - those are called components and why do
13:13 - we call them components
13:15 - we call them components because i don't
13:17 - know can i use these in different parts
13:19 - of the uh software system yes exactly
13:22 - that's the really cool part about us
13:23 - because you can reuse them in multiple
13:24 - parts
13:25 - of your piece of software right okay so
13:28 - i can take for example i can take
13:30 - this for example this component and i
13:31 - can reuse it where
13:33 - here and here and here
13:37 - and here and everywhere and so forth
13:40 - so it becomes like a little lego block
13:42 - it's like a lego you could use to build
13:44 - something because it's the same four by
13:45 - four lego blocks
13:46 - two by four okay exactly exactly pretty
13:48 - cool right make sense okay
13:50 - and then on the right hand side right
13:51 - here we have a chat window so we're
13:52 - gonna make that chat one that that's
13:54 - going to be
13:54 - later on as we go to part day two and
13:57 - day three and so forth okay perfect yes
13:59 - but for now let's focus on now really
14:01 - quickly okay guys okay
14:02 - if you think about all these different
14:04 - things we have what this chat okay yes
14:06 - we said that
14:06 - we had this sidebar we said that now the
14:09 - sidebar you see how
14:10 - it's all kind of rows and columns there
14:13 - you always have to structure your things
14:14 - in rows
14:15 - and columns so you can see we have one
14:17 - row here that's the header correct
14:20 - what's another row i would assume the
14:22 - other row would be
14:23 - the rest of it right which includes the
14:25 - sidebar and the main bar correct so the
14:27 - rest of it which includes
14:28 - those see now this becomes its own
14:30 - little component it's a little div we
14:32 - call the div container guys okay
14:34 - now inside that that's when you have the
14:37 - sidebar
14:38 - and that's when you have the chat
14:40 - because now those are columns
14:41 - yeah like i can't go from from rows to
14:44 - columns like just kind of interweedly i
14:46 - have to create
14:46 - rows within columns and columns within
14:50 - rows that make sense does that make
14:52 - sense that makes sense cool so we have
14:54 - that right now let's just go ahead and
14:55 - create that pretty much that's all we
14:56 - now need to do
14:57 - let's create that right now perfect all
14:59 - right so if we go ahead i'm going to put
15:01 - my uh on the right hand side right here
15:05 - all right so of course guys to just get
15:07 - this started you guys need to install
15:08 - node.js just for those of you who don't
15:10 - have it nodejs right here make sure you
15:12 - still know gs.org
15:13 - download it right here if you don't have
15:15 - it just install it no problem
15:17 - if you have it great for you and of
15:18 - course this code is our choice of code
15:20 - editor
15:21 - and as a reminder guys if you happen to
15:23 - get stuck in any part of these
15:25 - parts it's totally fine just keep
15:27 - listening keep watching keep
15:29 - being engaged so you can make sure
15:30 - you're learning and you can always watch
15:32 - the replay so that as the homework you
15:34 - can catch up and add even cooler
15:36 - features
15:36 - yes exactly exactly so again this
15:39 - there's going to be a replay so if you
15:40 - just cannot cannot catch up just you
15:42 - know don't worry just watch the video
15:44 - awesome so now let's go ahead and do
15:45 - this you have you have no no yes
15:48 - if you're on mac open up terminal if
15:50 - you're on windows i think it's
15:51 - powershell i think it's what's called
15:52 - is that what it's called or the command
15:53 - prompt command prompt i'm not sure
15:55 - i'm not i'm not a windows user
15:56 - [Laughter]
16:00 - anyways guys let's go ahead and do ls
16:01 - here i'm going to go into a project
16:04 - folder i have called github
16:05 - okay and what i'm going to do is i'm
16:07 - going to create a project using node.js
16:10 - with something called create react app
16:12 - now what that does is
16:14 - this sets up your whole project for a
16:15 - react application
16:17 - so of course you first need to install
16:19 - node.js
16:20 - which hopefully should have done now at
16:21 - this point let me go ahead and make this
16:23 - a little larger so you guys can see it
16:25 - right there let me go ahead and do a
16:27 - command k so you guys
16:28 - have it so now i'm github what i do is i
16:30 - npx and i say create
16:32 - dash react dash app right there
16:35 - and all i have to say now this point is
16:37 - what
16:39 - the name of the application yeah so
16:40 - let's go ahead and do this we'll say it
16:42 - um slack clone
16:46 - challenge how does that sound that
16:48 - sounds good to me challenge it's good
16:50 - okay so what's going to happen now is
16:51 - it's going to create our application and
16:53 - px
16:54 - node.js is creating this app fully from
16:56 - scratch
16:57 - it is creating the structure of the
16:59 - application most importantly
17:00 - and we'll use the structure to build on
17:02 - top of it makes sense perfect
17:04 - all right one one one all right let's go
17:06 - ahead we're doing this let's go
17:07 - it's currently doing other stuff and
17:08 - guys by the way looks like we are
17:10 - currently at
17:11 - 284 likes let's get to 300 likes come on
17:14 - like it up share it up pump it up let's
17:16 - go um like it up
17:18 - share it up let's go
17:21 - i'm even putting a like right here so we
17:23 - could get to 300. hey let's go
17:26 - we're currently at 286 guys
17:30 - a and we have ourselves a what a slack
17:33 - line you can see it's done it says
17:35 - when you see happy hacking it means you
17:37 - are all
17:38 - good my friends okay okay so happy
17:41 - hacking
17:41 - we have that next thing you want to do
17:43 - is open up these codes i'm going
17:44 - going to do a file a new window here on
17:47 - my vs code prompt
17:49 - i have my views code right here you can
17:51 - see okay all right and what's going to
17:53 - happen at this point is pretty simple
17:55 - all i will say is i will do file
17:58 - open let's do open i will go to the
18:01 - projects let's go ahead a github project
18:03 - right here
18:04 - slack clone challenge this is where i
18:05 - created i created my folder right here
18:07 - correct let's see this is our creative
18:08 - folder so
18:09 - open up that folder click open that's
18:12 - the whole folder where you just create
18:13 - your project
18:14 - click open boom there you go awesome so
18:17 - you have your project so let's take a
18:18 - look at what do you have
18:19 - now with this project i'm going to put
18:21 - on the left hand side so you guys can
18:22 - see it
18:23 - make this a little larger so you guys
18:24 - can see it as well right there beautiful
18:26 - everybody comprehending everybody good
18:28 - and we have ourselves a super chat
18:30 - let me see oh he sent us a message oh
18:36 - he's awesome guys awesome thank you so
18:38 - much that was that was super chat from
18:40 - uh from uh from kazi looks like yes sir
18:42 - have this like open at all times yes yes
18:46 - yes yes
18:47 - cool so we have i mean the slide clone
18:48 - is here so yeah we have that here
18:50 - cool so we have that on the right hand
18:51 - side let's go ahead and vs code on the
18:53 - on the right hand side
19:09 - so that's what the first thing to do so
19:10 - again right click integrate terminal npm
19:12 - start that's the first thing to do
19:14 - let's go okay awesome i will say yes you
19:17 - might not have this but i will say yes
19:19 - for now
19:19 - no problem and we have ourselves
19:22 - let's see let's see our first
19:26 - react application now we're going to
19:28 - move ourselves myself to the middle so
19:29 - we
19:30 - we can do it like this oh that's good
19:31 - that's good no in the middle yeah that
19:33 - one in the middle
19:33 - in the middle so now we have now we have
19:35 - the code over here yep yep we have
19:38 - sorry code over here slide clone over
19:40 - here beautiful exactly
19:41 - all right so app.js let's take a look at
19:43 - what do we have in terms of code well
19:46 - here's the thing guys your whole
19:47 - application is within where
19:49 - within right here within this portion
19:53 - right here you see this right here
19:54 - this is the whole slack application can
19:56 - you make this two thirds as well so it
19:58 - takes more space
19:58 - i really um i don't like that
20:02 - okay we'll see for now so for now i'll
20:04 - just make it then i'll change it up
20:06 - later
20:06 - so let's go ahead so i have header right
20:08 - here this means right here this means
20:10 - that
20:11 - the whole app the whole app is in the
20:14 - header guys you see this
20:15 - you see how we have edit and save to
20:16 - reload right here edit and save to your
20:18 - load
20:19 - that's where the app is it's inside
20:21 - app.js now you might be thinking okay
20:22 - how does that show up on the actual
20:23 - application well
20:24 - it's pretty simple if you go to index.js
20:27 - all you have to do
20:28 - look and see you see how react dom the
20:30 - render and this renders the app
20:31 - yeah pretty simple the way it works is
20:34 - they actually imports the
20:35 - app component the big app component and
20:38 - it imports it from there
20:40 - and then what it does is it actually
20:42 - puts it into
20:43 - the root element of the html where's
20:46 - that root element
20:47 - if you go to public if you go to any
20:49 - html guys you see right here
20:51 - this div id root that's where the whole
20:54 - react.js lives literally so gets all the
20:58 - code from this app.js and it puts it
21:00 - into this div right here so
21:02 - that's where the application is exactly
21:04 - exactly exactly sense
21:05 - pretty pretty simple guys okay so what
21:07 - we're going to do is we're going to
21:08 - remove this header for now let's go
21:10 - ahead and remove this we don't need this
21:11 - at all right now no not necessary okay
21:14 - and instead instead of here we actually
21:16 - have a different application we'll have
21:18 - the actual slack
21:19 - clone app in here so you see now it's
21:21 - all white no problem whatsoever
21:23 - okay cool now what are we going to do
21:25 - with this at this point well
21:27 - a few things in order for us to be able
21:30 - to
21:30 - to be able to kind of you know go
21:34 - from login to be able to go to a
21:36 - different page
21:37 - we're going to use or something called a
21:40 - router guys
21:41 - a router is kind of how you go from page
21:43 - to page let's say you go to
21:44 - about page then you go to example on
21:46 - facebook you go to your news feed
21:47 - or you go to your profile feed right
21:49 - it's routing through different pages
21:51 - you click on something and it goes to a
21:52 - different route okay correct
21:54 - that makes it so here's what we'll do in
21:56 - here in here okay
21:58 - in here i will go ahead and do a new
21:59 - terminal and i will
22:01 - npm install react router dom so we'll
22:04 - say npm install
22:07 - react dash router dash dom
22:10 - right there let's do that right now npm
22:12 - install
22:13 - and the right arrow down i'm going to
22:14 - show you react router
22:17 - i'll show it to you here just so you
22:19 - guys understand it if you see the web
22:21 - you can see right here this is the react
22:23 - router you see we can do switch and we
22:24 - can go
22:25 - different routes depending on what we
22:27 - want to do so we can show users or about
22:28 - depending on the route that we want
22:30 - oh so the route is the url path right
22:33 - exactly right change the url to slash
22:35 - about it's going to take me to the about
22:37 - react component exactly exactly exactly
22:41 - so let's go ahead and take a look at
22:42 - this so the first thing what i will do
22:43 - is check this out i will go ahead and go
22:45 - here and i will say
22:46 - i will say router
22:50 - router that's the first part and that
22:52 - rod is that's where
22:53 - where our routes will live now in order
22:55 - to use that we have to import that let's
22:57 - go ahead and remove this here for a
22:58 - second we don't need this
22:59 - let's use import router so i will say
23:01 - import
23:02 - now we'll say from browser router this
23:05 - is called browser
23:07 - router as router what does this mean
23:11 - what does that mean daniel that we are
23:13 - going to import
23:14 - uh a specific thing from the libraries
23:16 - called browser router and we're naming
23:18 - it
23:19 - router so that we can reference it in
23:20 - our code router yes correct
23:22 - exactly because i don't want to use
23:23 - browser router in here instead i'm going
23:25 - to call a router so this kit is just
23:27 - kind of renaming
23:28 - guys you're in a different name and can
23:29 - you explain why you have three different
23:31 - as
23:31 - is so check this out router route and as
23:33 - it says
23:36 - three different as is as is so yeah so
23:38 - i'm gonna hold on one second
23:39 - i'm gonna import this from react
23:42 - router dash dom boom
23:46 - react right there's down okay cool so
23:49 - that's all awesome
23:50 - that is all great now the reason why we
23:52 - have browser router router
23:54 - route and switch it's for one reason is
23:57 - because we're actually using all these
23:58 - three different ones right if you look
24:00 - at react router
24:01 - you see we have to use switch and route
24:03 - and so forth yeah makes sense yep that
24:04 - makes sense
24:05 - cool so let's go ahead and do this let's
24:07 - go ahead and do here inside here we'll
24:08 - have two routes
24:10 - one it's going to be for login another
24:13 - one is going to be for the chat
24:15 - okay gotcha so let's do this right now
24:17 - so i will say switch
24:21 - switch right here inside the switch
24:24 - we'll go ahead and say route right here
24:27 - like this route
24:29 - boom boom route okay
24:32 - and that's gonna be one route and this
24:34 - route we're gonna give it a path we'll
24:36 - say path is equal to
24:37 - what should the path be is this gonna be
24:40 - for the login or is this gonna be for
24:41 - the main page
24:42 - gonna be for let's say for the main page
24:45 - if it's gonna be the main page usually
24:47 - that's just a slash
24:48 - yes well it's gonna be for the room page
24:50 - so we'll do it here
24:51 - page so the room is going to be actually
24:53 - the room when you go to channel that's
24:55 - the page we want to use okay now inside
24:57 - that page we
24:58 - need to reference something like it's
24:59 - going to be some kind of a page right
25:01 - some sort of component exactly so let's
25:02 - say for example this is the chat page
25:04 - right
25:04 - chat page right here there's a chat page
25:08 - okay
25:08 - the next route is going to be what
25:12 - now this one's going to be the login
25:13 - exactly so say path
25:15 - equals and it's going to be dash so the
25:18 - home page is actually going to be the
25:20 - login
25:20 - page okay so whenever we can't go to the
25:23 - room
25:24 - we'll just straight you take you
25:25 - straight back to logging guys make sense
25:27 - that's pretty simple all right let's go
25:29 - ahead and add that up okay
25:30 - that's me one route and this is going to
25:32 - be the login
25:34 - page right there all right cool so let's
25:36 - go to save this if i say this this
25:38 - should technically now
25:39 - show it to me in our application look at
25:41 - this we have a login page right now
25:43 - because why
25:44 - we're in the roots right now you see
25:45 - based off the url exactly okay
25:47 - but if i go to room let's say
25:50 - oh let's go you see
25:54 - very simple right now you have a chat
25:56 - page and you have
25:57 - a login page just like that
26:00 - yo yo guys what is going on uh one of
26:05 - the things i wanted to mention because i
26:06 - am in the chat and i'm taking a look at
26:08 - what you guys are saying so i saw
26:09 - katrina
26:10 - say this and i saw a couple of people
26:11 - brian don't stress
26:13 - guys um if you are new to react
26:16 - and you're having trouble following
26:18 - along that is totally okay the whole
26:20 - point is to show you what's possible
26:22 - with react
26:23 - and later we can show you how to do it
26:25 - step by step
26:26 - remember the video is also going to be
26:28 - there so you can watch it anytime
26:30 - later at your own pace this is a lot to
26:32 - cover so just follow along
26:34 - have fun pay attention and you can code
26:37 - along later
26:38 - if things are not working right now okay
26:39 - so don't worry you're not alone we got
26:41 - you
26:42 - yeah exactly exactly guys don't worry
26:44 - you will be able to watch the video
26:46 - later on for now just kind of watch
26:48 - enjoy be part of the community and of
26:50 - course if you can follow okay awesome so
26:52 - we have these two pages
26:53 - now one really cool thing about what
26:56 - about
26:57 - react is that we use components remember
26:59 - how many components and we split the
27:00 - components up
27:01 - you know in slack long in this slack
27:03 - remember that yes
27:04 - so to create components it's a very
27:07 - simple process
27:08 - right we have the header component and
27:09 - so forth let's create the chat component
27:11 - and let's go ahead and create the which
27:13 - component
27:14 - the logging component yeah that's pretty
27:16 - much it so what we're going to do is on
27:17 - the left hand side guys you see on the
27:19 - left where it says source let's go ahead
27:20 - and create new folder and this under
27:21 - source
27:22 - let's create a folder and create a
27:24 - folder called components
27:26 - oh okay that's the components folder
27:28 - inside the components folder we'll do
27:29 - new file and we'll say
27:30 - chat chat.js boom right there
27:34 - that's the chat component guys okay to
27:36 - create our chat component it's as simple
27:38 - as typing in rfce now
27:40 - if you don't have this ability to rfc
27:43 - for example
27:44 - here's what you can do here's what you
27:46 - can do you can go to extensions
27:48 - you can go to and then you can you want
27:50 - to look for es7
27:52 - react right here react code
27:55 - snippets and this right here and this
27:57 - extension allows
27:59 - you this right here to do code snippets
28:02 - like rfc and so forth to really quickly
28:05 - create those components
28:06 - make sense makes perfect sense comprende
28:09 - all right good so go ahead and install
28:12 - those
28:13 - if you want of course i highly recommend
28:14 - this so install this right if you
28:16 - have install button at that point that's
28:18 - pretty much it so let's go back to chat
28:19 - js
28:20 - and look at this guys here's some magic
28:22 - for you rfc
28:24 - enter boom right there oh let's go
28:30 - [Music]
28:33 - okay well good so i'm just keeping this
28:35 - smoothie running for a little bit
28:37 - so really i think it's really late yeah
28:39 - it's all good there we go so
28:40 - inside the chat we have our chat
28:42 - component and this is where we can say
28:44 - chat for example okay now the way we'll
28:46 - use the component if we go back to let's
28:48 - say
28:49 - app.js instead of now saying chat page
28:52 - we'll say like this we'll say
28:53 - import import chat
28:57 - from from where from our chat component
29:01 - component so we'll say dot slash dot
29:03 - slash meaning the current
29:04 - uh path the current directory components
29:08 - slash chat right there okay that's gonna
29:11 - get the chat
29:12 - all right so we'll say chat page and now
29:14 - instead of now doing
29:15 - the chat page we now replace this
29:18 - with uh the little less than greater
29:22 - than and we put a chat in
29:23 - that chat component check boom right
29:26 - there look at there see
29:27 - this is now guys the chat component
29:30 - think of it as a block right
29:32 - it's a block you took a block you're
29:34 - working on this block chat block
29:35 - and now you put the block as part of
29:37 - another block
29:38 - you see because the app is its own block
29:40 - yes makes sense so if we go to that
29:42 - chat dot js that's where all of the
29:45 - stuff
29:45 - about the chat inside of this div that
29:47 - we're calling chat that's where this is
29:49 - all gonna live
29:50 - exactly that makes sense to me pretty
29:52 - cool pretty cool awesome
29:53 - so we have chat that's pretty awesome
29:55 - next up let's go ahead and do this
29:57 - after chat let's go to app2gs let's quit
29:59 - the login now as well so we'll do this
30:00 - new file
30:01 - we'll say login.js
30:04 - oh right there let's do a new component
30:06 - on downloads with the rfce
30:08 - to create a new component there too rfc
30:10 - one right there
30:11 - you got that nice all right nice now if
30:13 - those people don't have the rfce
30:15 - can they just type this out noz yeah you
30:17 - can just type this out no problem so if
30:18 - you want you just type this out by
30:20 - yourself import react
30:21 - function login export default login so
30:23 - this is the basic code that you need to
30:25 - be able to create a component
30:27 - yes exactly perfect yes exactly we got
30:30 - those two components now now i can say
30:31 - login for example
30:33 - okay i go to app.js and set another
30:35 - login page where i'm gonna what am i
30:36 - going to replace this with
30:38 - this one could be the login component
30:40 - baby so but of course before we use it
30:43 - we have to import it so we'll say import
30:45 - login from where again it's going to be
30:48 - the path
30:49 - which is current directory components
30:51 - slash
30:52 - login because that is where we have
30:54 - their login.js there we go
30:56 - check this out now guys you ready for
30:57 - this are you ready for this yes sir
30:59 - look at this we'll say now login no not
31:03 - like this login
31:05 - boom boom boom okay okay save it
31:09 - and let's go let's go let's go oh
31:13 - we got the login
31:19 - beautiful nice nice nice so
31:22 - moving forward we have the login page
31:24 - okay no problem we have the chat page
31:26 - again if i go to rooms here room
31:29 - chat is right here now a few things need
31:32 - to modify before we move on
31:33 - the first thing you need to do what's up
31:34 - i just wanted to clarify something
31:36 - because i mean this looks the same as
31:37 - before but what's the real difference
31:39 - now than what we just had before nas the
31:42 - big difference is actually the fact that
31:43 - we're using now components before it was
31:45 - just a text
31:46 - and you were you were putting all your
31:48 - html into one file called app.js
31:51 - now you're splitting your functionality
31:54 - into multiple files
31:55 - one for chat one for login and what's
31:58 - really cool because
31:59 - think about it it's like if a car right
32:00 - in the car right you have a steering
32:02 - wheel that steering has its own function
32:04 - right if that steering wheel was like
32:06 - was also like in the car it was like the
32:08 - whole car was a steering wheel that
32:09 - would not make sense
32:10 - every single part has its own
32:12 - functionality it's a building block
32:14 - gotcha okay so we're kind of breaking it
32:16 - down to its core pieces
32:18 - of the website and then we're making
32:20 - those into its own different components
32:22 - exactly exactly okay i love it cool cool
32:25 - cool
32:25 - so let's go and do this so we have the
32:27 - login browser and we have the chat page
32:29 - now to make okay first first let's go up
32:31 - before mine let's go ahead and add that
32:32 - test.js i want to remove some files it's
32:34 - going to remove this so we'll delete
32:35 - after test.js we don't need that
32:37 - okay also for the at that css let's go
32:40 - ahead and do this i want to remove
32:41 - everything that's inside here so we'll
32:42 - do command a
32:43 - delete everything inside here we don't
32:45 - need that instead what i want to do is
32:47 - i'm going to do a margin like this i
32:48 - want to say margin
32:50 - margin zero right here margin zero cool
32:54 - so this right here margin zero guys
32:56 - stands for what
32:57 - this stands for every single element i
32:59 - want it to be margin
33:00 - zero because each one paragraph tags
33:02 - they all have margins we don't need
33:04 - those
33:04 - perfect okay okay so we got that that's
33:06 - deleted logos vg let's go and remove
33:08 - that too we don't need that specific
33:09 - that part two as well so i'll get svg
33:11 - see this portion as well move to trash
33:13 - cool all right
33:14 - we have pretty mild bare bones project
33:16 - app.js
33:18 - with that with that said a few things
33:20 - now we have to do
33:21 - inside our chat login
33:24 - page okay okay look at this
33:27 - so here's what we'll do i will go ahead
33:29 - inside the route i'm going to
33:31 - again to create this portion i'm going
33:34 - to create a container
33:36 - what's a container it's a container
33:38 - container is going to contain the dip
33:40 - it's going to contain everything it's
33:41 - going to be
33:41 - controlled the padding the margin inside
33:44 - the whole application
33:45 - okay okay look so here's what i'll do i
33:48 - will go ahead and inside the router
33:50 - i will say container
33:53 - boom right there now okay
33:57 - what is this now pretty weird right like
33:59 - what does it do
34:00 - i would say it's pretty weird would you
34:01 - say so i would say so yeah
34:03 - i'm trying to figure out what is this
34:05 - container so look i'm going to wrap this
34:07 - container
34:08 - inside this whole switch statement you
34:09 - see yeah inside this whole switch it
34:11 - makes sense yeah yeah yeah yeah okay
34:13 - so that's the whole container inside now
34:15 - that
34:17 - we're going to create a header remember
34:19 - how we create this header
34:20 - yeah this is the header remember this
34:22 - one yep let's create this header so
34:24 - we'll say here we'll say
34:27 - header boom that's me the header
34:31 - now it's not gonna work at all not going
34:34 - to work at all
34:35 - but that's okay because look at this if
34:37 - i save this and if i go ahead and go to
34:39 - react app boom
34:40 - i cannot define undefined why because
34:43 - these are actually divs
34:44 - and with these this what we're going to
34:45 - do is we're going to use styled
34:47 - components guys
34:48 - oh yeah that's the sick part style
34:51 - components
34:52 - in css we usually have css but in our
34:54 - case when you style components to create
34:56 - css look at this it's like basically
34:57 - javascript
34:58 - it's like css but on steroids and for
35:01 - those of you who don't know what css
35:02 - is it stands for cascade styling sheets
35:06 - i believe
35:06 - but it allows you to make the website
35:08 - look super pretty because right now
35:11 - we haven't had that we how to make it
35:12 - look purple how do we make it get wider
35:14 - how do we add all these
35:15 - css components and there's not as saying
35:17 - using style sheets
35:18 - you can do that on your react components
35:21 - yes so
35:22 - here's what we'll do let's go ahead and
35:24 - do this we'll say npm install
35:27 - styled dash components
35:31 - uh you guys don't see it hopefully you
35:32 - guys see at the bottom right there right
35:34 - there
35:34 - and then install style dash components
35:36 - you see at the bottom components right
35:39 - there
35:39 - all right install those beautiful by the
35:42 - way guys we currently have two 366 lines
35:45 - let's get to 400 come on
35:47 - i know you guys got this we believe in
35:49 - you guys you guys will take this to 400.
35:51 - yes come on
35:52 - all right so we got the style component
35:53 - so good now to import them we'll say
35:55 - import styled
36:02 - from styled dash components
36:06 - boom okay so save that beautiful stock
36:09 - opponent so we imported them
36:10 - now what we do is look at this i just
36:12 - want you to pay attention
36:14 - oh we got frank in the house let's go oh
36:17 - super chick oh man always good to see
36:20 - you
36:20 - ramos i love that guy amazing
36:23 - okay so look what we're going to do now
36:26 - is we're going to create our first
36:27 - div i'm going to say container here's
36:28 - some say const container
36:32 - is equal to styled dot div this right
36:35 - here creates a div for those who don't
36:36 - know
36:36 - what a device david is a container right
36:38 - kind of like a little block
36:40 - element right so that's what what that's
36:42 - going to do that's the container
36:43 - then we're going to do for the header
36:46 - for now for the header we're going to
36:47 - create a separate component for the
36:49 - header
36:50 - so let's do this i will go to components
36:52 - and i will say new file
36:53 - and i will say header.js
36:57 - okay good inside there i will say rfce
37:01 - okay again this makes my life just so
37:03 - much easier guys i highly recommend
37:05 - extension
37:07 - then inside here i'm gonna say the
37:08 - header boom header good so that's the
37:11 - header okay
37:12 - cool let's go back to the gs let's go
37:15 - import the header we'll say
37:16 - import header from where
37:20 - components from components
37:23 - i like i just like yeah music is good
37:24 - the music is good oh you know just kind
37:26 - of it makes you go into the groove you
37:27 - know
37:28 - coding you know yeah so components and
37:30 - we'll say what
37:31 - header okay good so we got that portion
37:35 - now now it says header is not defined
37:38 - why is that why is that well pretty
37:42 - simple it's probably because then load
37:43 - properly
37:45 - you got me i was like oh my god we
37:47 - messed up
37:48 - we up now now before we go any
37:51 - further
37:52 - nas can we quickly reiterate through all
37:55 - these
37:56 - different components and tags that we
37:57 - have here just to make sure we
37:58 - understand what everything is
38:00 - so i want to make sure you get this
38:01 - right yeah so let's get this okay so
38:03 - look at this we
38:04 - currently have a few things holy snaps
38:05 - can we get two thirds again hold on bro
38:08 - it's so much easier like this hold on
38:10 - gosh darn it
38:12 - so look we have this this right here is
38:14 - the container you see this blue box
38:16 - that's the container so if i go ahead
38:17 - and brought put the brush that's the
38:19 - container
38:20 - now again i want to make sure i'm on the
38:22 - same page the container is going to be
38:24 - used
38:24 - to be able to style everything inside of
38:27 - it yes
38:28 - okay that makes sense right you have to
38:29 - continue kind of like for example here
38:31 - you have a water bottle right this right
38:33 - here is a container correct the water
38:35 - bottle is a container
38:36 - not sponsored by liquor head yeah so
38:38 - we're not supposed yet so this is the
38:39 - container but now let me ask you this
38:41 - if i drop food coloring into this
38:43 - container
38:44 - the water inside is gonna change to that
38:46 - color correct if i drop grass or
38:49 - dirt there's gonna be dirt in this water
38:51 - so this container now controls
38:53 - everything that's inside of it correct
38:55 - so if we style this container it's gonna
38:58 - show on everything else inside of it
38:59 - correct so now exactly exactly makes
39:01 - sense
39:02 - so cool now what we have is inside of
39:04 - that we have something called a header
39:05 - that's gonna be our header and this is
39:06 - this component right here perfect
39:08 - that's component now you have the chat
39:10 - and currently we're in the room
39:11 - the room path this is why we're
39:13 - currently in the room path
39:15 - this is why we see the chat window right
39:16 - here makes sense that makes sense cool
39:18 - and this is the chat window it's pretty
39:19 - simple okay so next up we've got the
39:22 - header we've got that let's go ahead and
39:23 - now actually maybe customize the header
39:25 - a little bit
39:26 - i would say so let's customize the
39:27 - container let's customize
39:29 - the header for the container guys again
39:32 - we say you want to have a full width
39:34 - because we'll do it we'll say here we'll
39:35 - say width
39:36 - width 100 100
39:41 - 100 i will say height is going to be
39:44 - what
39:45 - what do you guys think would it just be
39:48 - the full height
39:48 - full height so we'll say 100 vhs now
39:50 - what this means vh guys
39:52 - stands for 100 vertical height
39:56 - of the whole browser window okay so
39:59 - we'll take up the whole vertical height
40:00 - for that container
40:01 - if i say background color here for
40:03 - example background and i say orange
40:06 - okay look at this boom back on orange oh
40:10 - let's go you see just like that this
40:13 - right away tell i know right
40:14 - this right away tells us that this right
40:16 - here is the container because
40:18 - it's the whole orange box makes sense
40:19 - comprende yep yep yes
40:21 - good we got that next up let's go and do
40:23 - this we're create we're going to create
40:25 - after that
40:26 - something called a what grid
40:29 - um what does agree to do so look at this
40:33 - this is the header okay
40:36 - underneath that because we have the
40:38 - sidebar right and the chat
40:40 - window we're gonna wrap that as well in
40:43 - its own little container oh cause those
40:45 - are two different columns correct
40:46 - remember yeah the sidebar here
40:47 - yep yep right and then you have the chat
40:49 - window here yeah we're going to wrap
40:51 - those in something called the main
40:53 - okay look at this here's what i'll do i
40:56 - will say here
40:57 - header and i will say now main
41:01 - boom i will copy this main right here
41:04 - copy this main all right command access
41:07 - now put it more again in the switch
41:08 - route
41:10 - main look at this okay all right main
41:14 - now this main so main is not defined
41:16 - don't worry about that we'll go ahead
41:17 - and
41:18 - create it right now so say const main is
41:21 - equal to
41:22 - styled styled
41:25 - that div
41:29 - well right there cool awesome so that's
41:32 - the main now you don't see the main
41:33 - right
41:33 - just yet but that's okay that's
41:35 - completely okay here's what we'll do
41:37 - guys
41:37 - remember how we had the head at the top
41:38 - the main is gonna be below it right
41:41 - what we can do to really make this cool
41:43 - because if i say background color here
41:44 - let's make the background
41:46 - of oh wrong one if i say background
41:50 - background of let's say for example blue
41:53 - okay
41:54 - back on blue now that's the main you see
41:56 - it's really small
41:58 - now exactly we want we want to take up
42:00 - the full height correct
42:01 - correct the full height now how do we do
42:03 - that well look at this
42:04 - if i go to here header main in
42:07 - the container remember how we said how
42:09 - the container controls everything yeah
42:11 - i would define the height of the header
42:13 - and define the height of the main oh
42:16 - cause those are inside the container
42:18 - exactly
42:19 - how cool is that this is guys this is
42:21 - why coding is so cool okay
42:23 - look at this i will say here in the
42:24 - container i will say display
42:28 - grid boom grid is going to define the
42:32 - height
42:32 - and all i have to say now at this point
42:34 - guys is something called grid template
42:35 - rows i will say here
42:37 - grid dash template
42:40 - dash rose and here i will say what
42:44 - this our my first row
42:47 - is go here's what i think i can say
42:49 - height here and i can say height here
42:53 - i need to define the height of my first
42:55 - row and the height of my second row
42:57 - okay you understand yep you understand
42:59 - so look at this my first height of the
43:01 - header which is going to be 38 pixels
43:03 - height
43:04 - that's part one okay that's the one
43:07 - that's the height of my header
43:09 - now the height of my main diff which as
43:11 - we said was what
43:12 - which is which one this div right this
43:16 - whole big shenanigan right here second
43:18 - row
43:19 - huh the second row i say auto guys
43:23 - auto oh you see so does auto just fill
43:28 - out the rest of the
43:28 - the rest of it that's what it does that
43:31 - makes sense so now we have the header
43:32 - and we have the mean which has that
43:35 - which has the sidebar and the chat would
43:36 - that make sense perfect makes sense
43:37 - perfect
43:38 - cool awesome so we got that portion
43:40 - that's all cool all right
43:41 - we got the portion now let's go ahead
43:43 - and go into our what
43:46 - and actually create a sidebar as well
43:48 - sure okay the sidebar let's do it let's
43:49 - do a sidebar
43:50 - look at this as since the recruit
43:51 - destruction now at this point we can
43:52 - just do that no problem
43:54 - all right let's go ahead and do that so
43:56 - the sidebar is going to be where now
43:59 - under the sidebar okay the sidebar is
44:01 - now going to be
44:02 - on the left this side we're going to be
44:04 - here correct
44:05 - and the main window is going to be here
44:07 - correct perfect cool
44:08 - so here's what we can do i can inside
44:10 - here i will say inside the main i will
44:12 - say
44:13 - sidebar i will create a component for
44:17 - the sidebar
44:18 - you see i like this so everything is
44:20 - made out of components everything's made
44:22 - out of components that's the cool part
44:23 - about this guys
44:24 - that's amazing all right all right so
44:26 - cyborg that's the component
44:28 - boom now of course you need to create
44:30 - the component first let's go ahead and
44:31 - go to components right here
44:33 - we'll do components and we'll say new
44:34 - file and we'll say sidebar
44:37 - sidebar.gs oh somebody gs
44:40 - okay amazing so that's still all good
44:42 - inside this let's create
44:43 - our own component rfce
44:50 - rfce yeah rfce
44:53 - yeah okay so sidebar that's our
44:55 - component now so we have a sidebar
44:56 - section here
44:58 - okay at the gs let's go ahead and import
45:01 - the sidebar so i will say here
45:03 - import sidebar
45:06 - from what our sidebar component path
45:10 - components and we'll say sidebar right
45:13 - here
45:13 - pretty simple you see pretty simple cool
45:17 - we have now that that's all good let me
45:19 - go ahead and see this we have a cyber
45:20 - component we have that component i love
45:22 - that okay
45:23 - next up is what now now you have a
45:25 - sidebar in the chat but you see how
45:26 - these two components are next to each
45:28 - other
45:28 - we don't want that no we don't so here's
45:30 - what we'll do instead
45:32 - we also use something called display
45:34 - grid guys
45:35 - also display grid display grid and see
45:37 - how the main
45:38 - the main is the container for the slide
45:42 - bar in the chat would you agree through
45:43 - that one yes i
45:43 - totally agree yes so we can also display
45:46 - grid to despite the width
45:48 - of this and the width of the chat oh see
45:51 - look at this
45:52 - so here's what i'll say i will say here
45:53 - display grid
45:56 - let's play grid and now here's one do
45:58 - i'm going to say now instead of doing
46:00 - rows i will do columns i will say grid
46:03 - template dash columns
46:06 - okay and inside here i will have now
46:09 - what
46:09 - the width of the first column and the
46:11 - width of the second column
46:13 - so very similar to the heights how we
46:15 - had them before yes
46:17 - our first column width is going to be
46:19 - what is going to be
46:20 - 260 pixels for now sounds good
46:23 - now what do you think is going to be the
46:25 - width of our second column though
46:27 - very similar to before i think we want
46:28 - the second column to take up the rest of
46:30 - the space
46:31 - yes so we simply say auto auto boom
46:34 - look at that now the sidebar is in the
46:36 - left hand side the chat is not so look
46:38 - i want you to show it to you if i go
46:40 - here and i will say
46:41 - for example sidebar let's go to sidebar
46:43 - and i will say here
46:45 - uh let's create a sidebar and i will say
46:47 - here style is equal to
46:49 - background let's go make that for
46:52 - example
46:53 - background so he's about to color the
46:56 - background so we could see the
46:57 - distinction
46:58 - of what the sidebar represents
47:01 - whoa right there this looks exactly
47:05 - like the sections look at that structure
47:06 - that we had before see how the structure
47:08 - we had before what is it
47:09 - where's the structure before right there
47:10 - right there that's our structure so we
47:12 - now guys
47:14 - have the architecture of the application
47:16 - and you always start out
47:18 - with the architecture always always okay
47:21 - always so now we have the architecture
47:23 - and looks how it looks it looks i mean
47:24 - it looks i know i know it looks stupid
47:25 - because but bunch of like red colors
47:27 - it's it's like a rainbow you know but i
47:28 - think it's cool because when you color
47:29 - like that you could see the architecture
47:31 - you could see the stream
47:32 - you could make sure you're on the same
47:33 - page so whenever you're modeling
47:35 - anything
47:35 - this is a great way to start always oh
47:38 - it's very visual exactly
47:39 - so now we have that well i'm going to
47:41 - going to remove this color because it
47:42 - looks hideous okay
47:45 - all right we got that sidebar chat
47:47 - that's so good
47:48 - and now let's go back to the js and now
47:50 - what we can do is we can focus
47:52 - only on the header now let's do it let's
47:53 - do that right now
47:55 - so let's go to the header let's go to
47:56 - the header and focus on the header so
47:58 - i'm going to go to the header right now
47:59 - out of the gs
48:00 - now the color of the header what are we
48:02 - adding oh let's go and remove this
48:03 - background as well i don't need this i
48:05 - color orange remove that okay cool now
48:07 - the header is there
48:09 - now in the header no not sidebar in the
48:12 - header it's pretty simple guys
48:14 - let's go ahead for the header root also
48:15 - create its own container
48:17 - because it has it is its own component
48:19 - you see that right there yep right so
48:21 - let's go ahead go
48:22 - header let me see okay good so i will
48:25 - say here instead of the div
48:26 - i will say container
48:30 - container container right there okay
48:34 - also container right here
48:38 - container comprende now containers are
48:41 - defined because why
48:43 - because it is a style component that we
48:45 - have not yet
48:47 - that created we need to import style
48:48 - components or import style
48:50 - style right here styled is equal to
48:54 - from style dash components
48:58 - good right there all awesome
49:01 - save that and then we could create that
49:03 - component right here so we'll say const
49:05 - container is equal to styled dot
49:08 - div like so now i want to ask a question
49:12 - because i'm not too familiar with style
49:13 - components
49:14 - yes can we name it something other than
49:16 - container or does it have to be
49:17 - named container that's actually a really
49:19 - good question that's actually a good
49:21 - question
49:22 - and no we can name it anything we want
49:24 - okay
49:25 - but container makes sense in this case
49:26 - yeah because it contains the header
49:28 - component right so
49:29 - it kind of like this is a bog like we
49:30 - call this a bottle right but they call
49:32 - it they could have probably called it
49:33 - something else i don't know
49:34 - a container water contraption i don't
49:36 - know
49:37 - you know but they call it a bottle right
49:40 - in our case
49:40 - contains water it encapsulates water it
49:44 - has a lot it has one yes a lot of people
49:46 - are like joe diaz is like in the house
49:48 - like comprende
49:50 - what's up joe diaz awesome so container
49:52 - is a style dip also i'm going to save
49:54 - that
49:54 - let's go and refresh this portion that's
49:57 - the header now
49:58 - what are we going to do with the header
49:59 - a few things well inside the header
50:01 - let's create a few different things
50:02 - inside the header
50:03 - we'll have two sections our first
50:05 - section is going to be which section
50:07 - it's going to be and i'm going to make
50:09 - this a little bit larger actually i'll
50:10 - make this a little bit smaller
50:13 - right there so our first section guys is
50:15 - pretty simple oh that's not what i want
50:20 - okay our first section guys is going to
50:22 - be oh fudge
50:24 - okay our first session guys is going to
50:26 - be this one
50:28 - this one so we'll have this section is
50:30 - going to contain
50:31 - the search bar it's going to contain
50:35 - this and this and our second's actually
50:36 - going to contain the username
50:38 - so we are also splitting this up into
50:40 - guys into two components
50:42 - makes sense our first component here
50:44 - second component here
50:46 - but they're all styled components so
50:48 - let's go and take a look at this
50:49 - okay if i go to here i'm going to call
50:52 - this one the main one so
50:54 - this one right here is going to be the
50:55 - main one so if i go to my react app
50:59 - i will say main main right here
51:02 - that's going to be my main style
51:03 - component and this is going to contain a
51:05 - few different things between the icons
51:06 - and so forth then the second one is
51:07 - going to be
51:09 - then i'm going to say user container
51:13 - user container oh
51:17 - look at this guys all right user
51:18 - container that's going to contain the
51:20 - user make sense
51:22 - if i go back to here again again this
51:26 - ah this right here goes for
51:29 - this stands for domain user container is
51:32 - going to be the user version right here
51:33 - comprende good all right for the user
51:36 - container let's go ahead and uncomment
51:37 - this out for now so command
51:39 - slash for two or control slash to
51:41 - comment out your code here
51:42 - okay that's pretty much it so now
51:46 - what this portion
51:51 - this portion let's do this in the main
51:55 - section
51:56 - we have two icons we need to go ahead
51:58 - and install the first icon is going to
51:59 - be we'll have an icon suction
52:01 - icon section and then we have icon here
52:03 - i can hear now how are we going to
52:04 - use those users like us tell me are we
52:06 - going to use some sort of library we can
52:08 - import
52:08 - cool icons we use something called
52:10 - material ui material
52:12 - ui icons look at this i've heard about
52:15 - this a couple times
52:16 - right there so my two ui icons this
52:19 - right here is allows you to use these
52:21 - amazing icons right here
52:22 - so for example if i want to use this
52:24 - icon i simply do
52:26 - access time click on it tells me how to
52:28 - use it oh that's the exact code that you
52:30 - need just to import it
52:31 - exactly that's it right but of course
52:33 - guys like
52:34 - like we cannot just use them we have to
52:37 - actually import create them
52:38 - install the module for it so once we
52:41 - install
52:42 - the module which is called material
52:44 - icons then we can use it
52:46 - so the first thing source we need to do
52:47 - is we need to go to our code and go back
52:49 - to our react app
52:50 - we need to go to our code and say npm
52:52 - install npm install
52:54 - and we'll say here um let me go back to
52:57 - material ui
52:58 - at material ui at material
53:02 - material dash ui before we install once
53:05 - we install the core material eye
53:08 - core right here okay install that
53:11 - boom right there that's gonna be the
53:12 - core that's the core material ui
53:15 - after you've got that we're going to
53:16 - install npm install and start material y
53:19 - by icons that's it perfect
53:22 - okay now two sections and now we have
53:25 - access
53:26 - to all of these amazing icons exactly
53:29 - images
53:29 - exactly so now late guys before you go
53:32 - move on guys let's go ahead and get us
53:33 - up to 500 likes we are currently at 453
53:36 - you are amazing and we love you so much
53:37 - let's get us up to 500 likes i know you
53:40 - guys can
53:46 - oh okay beautiful all right so with
53:49 - this section right here okay how do we
53:52 - use now those icons well
53:53 - just how we copied it all i have to do
53:55 - is click on let's say we click on the
53:56 - access time
53:57 - i will copy this code right here copy
54:00 - this code
54:00 - i will then go to where i will then go
54:03 - to my app
54:05 - and then i will import it
54:08 - right here and i can simply use it
54:11 - like this like this
54:15 - access time like another component then
54:17 - like another component basically look at
54:18 - this
54:19 - and i close down like this boom done
54:23 - done that's it now it says here main is
54:26 - not defined why do you think that that's
54:27 - the case is because again we need to
54:28 - create a style component so we'll say
54:29 - const
54:30 - main is equal to styled dot
54:33 - div boom makes sense yep good that's the
54:37 - div
54:37 - awesome so look at this don't worry
54:39 - about the fact i may not define we just
54:40 - need to refresh it one more time so look
54:41 - at that
54:42 - now we have our own clock let's go
54:46 - all right what's the next what is the
54:48 - next icon we need to use huh it's that
54:50 - question question
54:51 - so let's do that one now so question
54:52 - mark let's see um
54:54 - question question this one help outline
54:58 - that looks good
54:58 - okay let's go and save this
55:02 - i like the song bro all right so we got
55:06 - that
55:06 - help outline icon beautiful we got that
55:09 - portion
55:10 - okay now again how do we use it guys
55:13 - we simply do help
55:17 - outline icon boom that's it comprende
55:20 - okay we got those are you ready bro i'm
55:23 - ready
55:23 - oh let's go we got two icons
55:27 - now now here's the thing we have the
55:30 - icons now let's create our what
55:32 - our search portion you see the search
55:34 - box let's create our search box
55:36 - so here's what we'll do inside here i'm
55:38 - going to create a search container i'll
55:39 - say search
55:41 - search container like so that's going to
55:44 - be my style component
55:45 - style component search container that's
55:47 - going to contain the whole
55:48 - input box okay then i will have the
55:50 - search
55:51 - box i will say search like this that
55:54 - could be another style component
55:55 - inside that i'm going to have an input
55:58 - box i will say
55:59 - input type is equal to text
56:02 - oh let's drop it people drop let's go
56:07 - let's go let's go oh oh
56:10 - let's go that's how we do but yeah let's
56:14 - go
56:14 - okay search so so search
56:17 - this is our input right here okay we
56:20 - have an input for
56:21 - placeholder search makes sense yes good
56:24 - all right
56:24 - search container search box all right
56:27 - now guys
56:28 - at this point at this point a few things
56:30 - you want to do
56:31 - now if i go back to here we're going to
56:33 - have an issue searching
56:34 - they're not defined and search is not
56:36 - defined as well so again we're going to
56:38 - create those specific parts so we'll say
56:40 - const
56:42 - search container
56:45 - is equal to styled dot dip
56:49 - both okay now now nothing here just yet
56:52 - that was a const search
56:56 - it is equal to styled styled
56:59 - dot div okay boom also
57:02 - now this now works but look at this you
57:04 - see how the search is here it looks
57:06 - hideous it's like
57:07 - it's like yeah yeah it's like
57:14 - what a sad sad ui
57:20 - so how do we do it nice
57:23 - that's a good i'll actually wait for
57:25 - that
57:28 - all right so the way we do that is
57:30 - pretty simple you see how the main
57:32 - kind of like you know the main wraps
57:35 - everything correct yes so what we do is
57:37 - we go to the main
57:38 - and we say display flex on the main look
57:42 - at this
57:43 - on the main i say display
57:46 - display flex now what is the place this
57:48 - place like you can spend for a second
57:50 - what does it look like
57:52 - is it going to order things inside of
57:54 - this div
57:55 - yes display flex allows us to order
57:58 - things
57:58 - layout like and nothing else it's such a
58:02 - powerful tool
58:03 - if you guys see it right here flags
58:05 - called flexbox
58:07 - flexbox right here guys right here see
58:09 - flexbox
58:10 - if you guys look at this right here this
58:13 - right here allows us to structure
58:14 - pretty much anything we want you know
58:16 - look at this horizontally
58:18 - vertically you want to flex wrap it wrap
58:20 - it you want to center it center it
58:22 - start and space around space between
58:24 - basically anything you want
58:25 - you got it so if you want to mess with
58:27 - your layouts you could go to flexbox
58:29 - and you'll see all the different things
58:30 - that you could do here exactly
58:32 - yes so now we've got this portion inside
58:34 - this flat spot let's go ahead
58:36 - what i will do a few things now this
58:38 - container contains
58:39 - also our what the user container the
58:42 - user container right here so let's go
58:43 - ahead and create the user container as
58:44 - well so i'm going to say user container
58:47 - as let's create a user container as well
58:48 - so i'm going to say user const
58:50 - user container is equal to styled
58:54 - dot dip makes sense okay cool
58:57 - now all right we got that inside the
58:59 - user container what are we going to have
59:01 - well a few things
59:02 - we're going to have the name right just
59:04 - like we have here
59:05 - the name and what and the image
59:09 - correct so let's do this let's go to our
59:11 - extrusion container
59:12 - and i will say here a few different
59:14 - things i will say name
59:16 - and the name will be what no sorry
59:20 - i'm just saying this like it's a long
59:21 - name i want to say tomoski coffee
59:24 - so then i will say and i will say for
59:26 - example now user image
59:28 - user image let's say okay
59:32 - cool that's going to contain the image
59:34 - comprende yes go ahead
59:35 - all right inside here let's create an
59:37 - image so say image
59:39 - source what is the source is equal to
59:41 - what
59:43 - source picture in there it's got a
59:44 - picture in here so i don't know how to
59:46 - copy this for you guys but
59:48 - maybe i don't know image source right
59:49 - here
59:51 - this is gonna be our image source right
59:53 - here now i can probably copy this i can
59:54 - probably send to daniel post then you
59:55 - could probably copy and paste it into a
59:57 - chat
59:57 - let me see i'll send to daniel right
59:59 - here
60:01 - where do you want me to copy paste it
60:02 - into uh into youtube window all right
60:07 - daniel there we go also can we
60:10 - uh zoom into the code boss oh you got it
60:13 - for sure bro
60:14 - maybe make it two thirds that won't
60:17 - change to zoom in but okay
60:19 - here how about that is that about it you
60:21 - want to zoom in like this you mean
60:22 - even bigger right here whoa whatever
60:24 - whatever the people make them happy
60:26 - there we go let's go okay
60:29 - awesome so we got that portion i think
60:31 - that's a bit big is that is that better
60:32 - for you guys
60:33 - i think that that was david saying that
60:35 - so i think he's okay
60:36 - it'll be good for now okay cool awesome
60:38 - so we got that
60:40 - let's go ahead and do this name is azari
60:42 - user image is there and of course we go
60:44 - direct direct tab nothing is there of
60:45 - course so what we need to do guys
60:47 - is create these components style
60:49 - components i will say here
60:51 - honst const i will say here what
60:55 - name name is eco2styled.dim
61:02 - boom okay next i'm going to create this
61:06 - const what const
61:09 - user image see user image
61:13 - image is equal to what
61:17 - equal to styled
61:20 - div boom right there done so that is
61:24 - done okay everybody that is done
61:26 - cool stuff not styled wait it's tied
61:28 - styled right here style
61:30 - now by the way what are these things
61:32 - that i'm seeing after the div because
61:33 - some people are asking oh
61:35 - these right here are called what are
61:36 - they called notations back ticks now
61:38 - these
61:39 - backtick guys are the reason where we
61:41 - put our csx
61:42 - css css okay this is where we put our
61:46 - css all right
61:48 - so that's it's called backticks guys if
61:50 - you don't know and backticks are very
61:51 - powerful
61:52 - actually allow us to do something called
61:53 - temple literals it's a very very
61:54 - powerful
61:55 - uh tool in coding javascript in general
61:58 - as well comprende
61:59 - comprende good all right awesome all
62:01 - right moving on
62:02 - moving on we have all these components
62:05 - they're all they're all great
62:07 - but here's the thing now if we go ahead
62:08 - and refresh this it looks shitty
62:11 - right it looks shitty bro right it looks
62:14 - good it looks nasty yeah it looks nasty
62:16 - okay again first is first let's go ahead
62:18 - and change this background color of
62:20 - of uh the white to be the color we want
62:23 - to be which is this orange color or this
62:25 - violet color right here
62:26 - okay so the first thing i'm going to do
62:28 - is i will get the background color
62:30 - let's go take this now put the where
62:32 - i'll put that in the container so
62:34 - container
62:35 - oh right there background color and guys
62:37 - copy this for yourself
62:38 - background pound sign three five zero d
62:41 - three six okay make sense good save that
62:44 - oh
62:44 - let's go look at that now it's all so
62:46 - much better okay
62:48 - we're going to set the color the color
62:49 - which is going to be the color of what
62:51 - the color white
62:53 - that's with the color of the icons but
62:55 - then right there okay now we get the
62:57 - icons that's all great
62:58 - that's cool now let's go ahead and
63:01 - structure it as well
63:02 - the icons are there but the czar is at
63:04 - the bottom so what do we do to make
63:06 - desire at the top or at the right hand
63:07 - side what do we do
63:08 - well didn't we do something called flex
63:10 - yeah let's go
63:12 - so since the container manages the main
63:15 - and the user container which are
63:17 - currently
63:17 - top to bottom what we say
63:21 - is we do display flex so let's say for
63:22 - example on the container we'll say
63:24 - just play flex let's play display flex
63:28 - let's go do you think we can hide the
63:29 - console real quick brother let's get
63:31 - more code
63:32 - thank you so much display flex we got
63:35 - that
63:35 - okay save that now now look at this now
63:38 - zary is
63:39 - here you see on the right hand side it
63:42 - went from vertical alignment to
63:44 - where to or horizontal alignment exactly
63:47 - okay now cool with that said with that
63:50 - said a few things
63:51 - okay we still want to fix this you see
63:53 - how this is a vertical alignment as well
63:55 - yep
63:55 - what can we do what do you think oh man
63:57 - i mean we've been using this specific
63:59 - thing called display flex so
64:01 - i'm assuming it's gonna be that again
64:02 - for the longest time let's go
64:04 - baby all right okay so user container as
64:07 - well
64:08 - since the user container is what
64:09 - contains the name and the user
64:12 - image i will on there i will say what
64:16 - display flex on this one
64:20 - boom oh let's go look how cool that
64:23 - looks now bro
64:24 - now i want you to watch it for a second
64:26 - okay here i'm gonna put this i'm gonna
64:27 - make this a little bit on the right hand
64:28 - side more
64:29 - right there like this look at this i
64:32 - want you to watch this as i'm typing
64:33 - this for a second okay look at this guys
64:35 - if i go ahead if i go ahead and display
64:39 - flex
64:39 - i will say in order to vertically align
64:42 - all of these you see how it's centered
64:44 - yeah they're all kind of like wonky
64:45 - right now where should you watch it
64:46 - right
64:47 - look at this guys if i go you see
64:50 - if i go to flexbox with my flexbox
64:54 - you see in order for us to change the
64:56 - vertical alignment we simply say align
64:58 - items right here so if i go to react app
65:02 - if i go to the container and i say align
65:05 - items what do i say now are you going to
65:09 - do
65:10 - the center center are you ready for this
65:12 - safe
65:13 - oh right on the job oh come on
65:16 - come on no
65:19 - it missed the oh man hold on never mind
65:22 - so what wait why didn't it work though
65:23 - align item center
65:25 - that's the vertical alignment let me see
65:27 - i need to go ahead can i try this
65:29 - oh i didn't refresh wait but you did it
65:32 - on this
65:33 - wait which no that's fine that's fine
65:35 - it's because the user container needs to
65:37 - be aligned
65:37 - uh uh vertically as well that makes
65:39 - sense yeah okay so if i do this look at
65:41 - this i do a line so on the user
65:42 - container i need to align the zari and
65:44 - this
65:44 - window as well i see align items
65:48 - center as well boom let's go
65:51 - hey let's go oh look at that that's
65:54 - beautiful
65:55 - now in order for us to now go ahead and
65:57 - space this portion around
65:58 - here's what we'll do i will say justify
66:01 - content space between on the container
66:03 - so i will say justify
66:04 - content defy content
66:07 - content and i will say space
66:11 - space between so space between is going
66:14 - to push after to the side
66:16 - okay but what what do you think it will
66:18 - push to the side
66:19 - um maybe all the components inside of
66:21 - this container
66:23 - well a few things we have two components
66:25 - one is this one
66:26 - one is this one it's going to spread
66:28 - these two components out because the
66:30 - container is this whole thing correct
66:32 - and then we have within that we have
66:33 - this and this can we show them on
66:36 - flexbox what the space between should be
66:38 - doing yeah if you go to flexbox right
66:40 - here
66:41 - let's see right there look at this guys
66:45 - you see this right here
66:46 - boom space between pushes items
66:51 - away from each other as far as possible
66:54 - it's like me
66:58 - see this is like me pushing daniel
67:00 - because i don't want it like i don't
67:01 - want to be near this guy you see what i
67:02 - mean
67:02 - i don't know why he's here i smell too
67:03 - much smells bad i smell bad
67:07 - so anyways that's whole the whole goal
67:10 - of this portion
67:11 - so if i just space between and i save
67:13 - this and then by the way could we change
67:14 - this to white real quick just because
67:16 - because too much it's a little too much
67:18 - yeah i think so too i agree
67:19 - let's go let's go to app.js i've done g
67:22 - yes background color blue
67:27 - how's that oh let's go badger beautiful
67:31 - okay thank you so now
67:39 - that's good stuff good stuff guys so we
67:42 - have that we have that space between now
67:43 - let's go ahead and add some padding and
67:45 - actually make this so much so much
67:46 - better than
67:46 - we actually should be so look at this
67:48 - now for the
67:50 - for this app a few things is going to
67:52 - happen we need to go ahead and one
67:54 - uh modify these icons let's go to
67:57 - header.js
67:58 - modify these icons right here the access
67:59 - time icon and the help
68:01 - outline icon to give it a little bit of
68:03 - width okay but you need to give it some
68:04 - width
68:05 - it makes sense okay but actually before
68:07 - that what i want to do is i want to go
68:09 - ahead and modify this
68:10 - input box i want to make this input box
68:12 - look just exactly like this
68:13 - oh yeah yeah because the white one looks
68:15 - nasty it looks just bad yeah yeah
68:17 - yeah so
68:20 - here's a little deal on the search
68:22 - container guys in the search container
68:24 - what we'll do let's go ahead a few
68:25 - things let's go to search container
68:27 - we'll give this one a min width for now
68:31 - manu width
68:34 - menu width of what 400 pixels
68:38 - right there 400 pixels that's the mini
68:39 - width okay so now
68:41 - you can see now it pushed everything to
68:43 - the side here correct
68:44 - but that's not the issue guys that's not
68:46 - the issue now what we do is we if we go
68:49 - to another search
68:50 - thing the search let's go now to search
68:51 - go to refresh this actually
68:53 - okay it's gonna go to search right here
68:54 - search can search
68:56 - search okay to modify the search a few
68:59 - things are going to happen
69:00 - number one is i'm going to go ahead and
69:03 - give
69:03 - this search a width of a hundred percent
69:06 - so let's say
69:07 - with oh 100
69:15 - let's see
69:18 - oh no not not this one search with 100
69:21 - oh cause that was a container that's the
69:22 - container so we'll have to give this one
69:24 - now the search inside of containers
69:25 - we're gonna make it spread
69:26 - all the way to get that width 100 and
69:29 - it's not doing it that's okay
69:31 - hold on let's see i'm seeing inspect
69:33 - element
69:34 - and spam input oh this
69:37 - adds because the input needs to be 100
69:39 - sanji width
69:40 - of this one's gonna be 100 let's go see
69:44 - okay just like that
69:44 - cool so no worries no worries so now
69:46 - what we're going to do is on the search
69:48 - a few things i want to go ahead for the
69:50 - search container or for the search
69:51 - let's do the first few things we're
69:53 - going to add a box shadow to add a kind
69:55 - of border around it so we'll say box
69:56 - shadow
69:58 - a smurf small border around this let's
70:00 - see like so
70:02 - so make sure you click you can copy this
70:03 - if you want crush this
70:05 - so now he'll box this border you see
70:07 - this box shadow small yeah that's what
70:09 - we've got now
70:09 - okay now what i want to do is i want to
70:11 - give it a small radius kind of like a
70:13 - concave kind of like uh give it us
70:15 - you know a nice smooth edge smooth
70:17 - smooth out
70:18 - man you know yes you gotta smooth it out
70:20 - so let's move down by really simply just
70:22 - saying border radius
70:24 - radius radius is equal to what
70:29 - smooth smooth no it's actually just
70:32 - pixels
70:33 - so we'll say six pixels if only man if
70:36 - only
70:37 - only coding was that easy just like i
70:39 - know
70:40 - but look at this guys you see how it
70:41 - changed look at this if i if i actually
70:44 - make this bigger for you so you guys can
70:45 - see it look at it you see that right
70:46 - there oh that looks so good
70:49 - how good does that look bro beautiful
70:51 - looks so
70:52 - sexy sexy look sexy sexy okay good so
70:55 - now we have that portion
70:57 - inside this let's go ahead and do a few
70:59 - things i'm going to
71:00 - um let me see a line item center should
71:03 - i do like items no i don't do that
71:04 - i want to now focus on the input this
71:06 - input looks horrible yes i don't like
71:08 - that
71:08 - blue it's just it's everything so it's
71:10 - just horrible so within the search i'm
71:11 - going to say input
71:13 - like this this is how you guys uh do css
71:16 - within style components i can do input
71:18 - on the search so it's going to basically
71:20 - it's going to target input within the
71:23 - search
71:24 - search container so we look at the
71:26 - component
71:27 - right the input is where inside of that
71:30 - search oh that makes sense okay we
71:32 - create the style component and now we're
71:34 - targeting the input within a stock
71:35 - component
71:35 - now because the input is in html this
71:37 - would target any input exactly inside of
71:40 - this component
71:41 - exactly makes sense to me make sense
71:43 - cool cool all right so we got that now
71:45 - we say for the input
71:46 - i will say background color and i will
71:49 - say
71:50 - transparent because i don't want to have
71:53 - the hideous background
71:54 - color transparent parrot
71:57 - oh come on okay trent now let's put
72:01 - it on right there oh and look at that
72:03 - see now transparent look at this you see
72:05 - boom ah now it's clean right i will also
72:08 - say
72:10 - border because you see how the hideous
72:11 - border border
72:13 - is equal to what hey
72:17 - let's go nah let's go hey
72:20 - let's go that's beautiful i'm going to
72:23 - give it a little bit of a patty i'm
72:24 - going to say padding left
72:26 - padding left of what pending 1178 pixels
72:32 - and i'm going to say padding right
72:35 - also going to be eight pixels you see so
72:38 - now
72:38 - we're just making some padding you see
72:40 - here on here looks good right yeah now
72:42 - question
72:42 - are we going to make this guy disappear
72:45 - watch the blue yeah are we going to make
72:47 - this all the way to the end later
72:48 - yeah we will don't worry about it oh i
72:51 - got you bro
72:53 - i got you guys okay all right so look
72:56 - for the search one what's going to
72:58 - happen is pretty simple
72:59 - if i go to search i will say here number
73:01 - one i want to modify because when i type
73:03 - here she types in black text i want to
73:04 - type in
73:06 - just go say color because the color is
73:08 - equal to white
73:10 - oh save that oh say that oh
73:13 - ah let's go let's go let's go oh that's
73:16 - so sexy man that's good it's so good
73:18 - it looks funny with the smaller image i
73:19 - know i know man okay now
73:21 - a few things let's go ahead and modify
73:23 - the uh a few things on the input you see
73:25 - when i click the click this it has like
73:27 - the blue
73:27 - color bro yeah what's that called no
73:29 - it's just i don't know just piece of
73:30 -  is what i'll say
73:32 - but what's it called though i agree with
73:35 - you but what's it called
73:36 - it's called the border but it's an
73:38 - outline actually it's an omelet on the
73:40 - focus of the element okay
73:42 - it's gonna outline yes exactly amazing
73:45 - that's exactly what it is
73:47 - so i will say here to remove that i will
73:49 - say input
73:51 - focus so on the focus of the input
73:54 - because
73:54 - it happens only when you focus on it you
73:56 - see that i will say
73:58 - outline none
74:02 - so now when i do this oh let's go
74:05 - outline look at this that is amazing
74:08 - now a few more things i want to do first
74:11 - thing i want to add a small padding tool
74:12 - so i'm gonna say
74:13 - you see how it's just very close to the
74:15 - first i wanna just wanna give it some
74:16 - more space you know give it space yeah
74:18 - space guys space in coding
74:22 - and user interfaces user experience
74:24 - really really important whenever you're
74:26 - developing any application
74:28 - giving a space giving a white space as
74:30 - always don't be as if it's not if it's
74:31 - clustered this is not
74:32 - good you know it's not enjoyable to see
74:35 - so
74:36 - what we'll do is we'll do what petting
74:37 - top
74:39 - padding dash top and what we'll give
74:41 - planet bro four pixels
74:43 - four pixels and panning bottom we'll
74:45 - give a what
74:46 - uh four four pixels as well let's go
74:51 - okay and look at that you see now it's
74:53 - there now it's more readable now it's
74:55 - not all
74:56 - compact exactly but it's still hideous
74:58 - it's still hideous
74:59 - why i don't know i asked you why no i'm
75:01 - not asking you bro
75:03 - why do you
75:03 - [Laughter]
75:06 - i don't know man you tell me what do we
75:08 - need to make better
75:10 - the search is actually not centered um
75:13 - or is it do we want in the center i
75:15 - don't know
75:17 - okay or vertically centered vertically
75:19 - yes oh i see what you're saying
75:20 - i think i've been horizontal so what i'm
75:22 - going to do is i'm going to say here i'm
75:23 - going to say
75:25 - uh i'm going to say
75:28 - i'm going to say align because the
75:31 - search is actually going to be flexible
75:32 - i'm saying display flex
75:35 - flex okay and i'm going to say align
75:37 - items
75:41 - center watch it watch it
75:44 - nothing changed because it actually is
75:46 - centered
75:48 - so it wasn't as likely as we thought so
75:49 - wasn't
75:51 - that's just my fault it's all good it's
75:53 - cool if you just add that extra
75:55 - yeah yeah yeah yeah cool so look now we
75:57 - have these icons this icon no problem
75:59 - now let's focus on these icons right
76:01 - here okay from printing nice good
76:03 - so and here a few things is going to
76:05 - happen well we have what we have the
76:07 - user container
76:09 - there we have a name and a user image
76:11 - now
76:12 - user container okay if we scroll down
76:16 - what happens well we have a display flex
76:18 - and align items center
76:20 - for the user container a few things i
76:22 - want to do is i want to give it some
76:23 - padding right
76:24 - of 16 pixels why because i want to have
76:26 - this image to
76:27 - a little bit more like a way for me you
76:28 - know what i mean so i'm going to say
76:29 - penny right
76:31 - padding right right
76:34 - and again guys for for those who don't
76:36 - know what is padding what is margin
76:37 - explain to them
76:39 - well a padding is the amount of space
76:41 - that will be given
76:42 - within an element while margin is the
76:44 - amount of space they'll be given outside
76:46 - of an
76:46 - element yes correct just kind of how you
76:48 - think about this if i go ahead
76:50 - have a right rectangle here okay guys if
76:52 - i have rectangle
76:53 - good poof okay this is my diff it's
76:56 - div yes your padding is
77:00 - space from inside see
77:03 - okay that's your padding so kind of how
77:05 - we had here we had this div
77:07 - you see and i said petting right 16
77:08 - pixels so i'm giving a space from inside
77:11 - i'm pushing it from the right hand side
77:12 - you see that right there
77:13 - that's a perfect explanation right there
77:14 - see yep yep and then margin
77:17 - margin is actually pretty cool margin is
77:20 - basically
77:21 - margin is space from the outside so
77:24 - here's what i'll do
77:25 - i'll say outside
77:28 - outside outside
77:31 - outside yep that's margin right that's
77:34 - pushing things from the outside
77:36 - not from the inside makes sense makes
77:37 - sense makes sense everybody
77:40 - in a chat yes or no i think so all right
77:42 - guys we are currently 516 likes can we
77:44 - get to 600 likes bro
77:46 - bump it up i know let's go let's get to

78:51 - okay inside our name let's go ahead and
78:53 - give that name
78:54 - some pending as well guys okay so for
78:56 - the name we'll do padding right 16
78:58 - pixels here as well
78:59 - heading right penny right
79:02 - 16 pixels
79:06 - okay see over there it just right away

79:28 - i don't like it i mean it's like it's
79:29 - yeah it's it's horrible horrible so
79:31 - here's what we'll do
79:32 - we're going to set the user image div
79:34 - the container you see we have a
79:35 - container right here
79:37 - let me go ahead and remove this force
79:38 - mode off
79:40 - image you have the container here and
79:41 - the image is actually inside the
79:42 - container
79:43 - okay i'm going to set the width and the
79:45 - height on the container first
79:47 - okay you see so here's what i'll do i'll
79:48 - say the user image is the container i'm
79:50 - going to say width for this one
79:52 - what and i'm going to say what 28 pixels
79:56 - and i'm going to say height is what is
79:59 - it also 28
80:00 - 28 pesos it's a box exactly now if i
80:04 - save this nothing's really going to
80:05 - happen
80:07 - why is that
80:11 - why because i have a spelled height what
80:14 - do you mean you misspelled height
80:18 - oh i did actually spilling it
80:21 - hides when you're picking oh oh my god
80:23 - it's horrible that looks horrible what'd
80:25 - you do
80:26 - i'm sorry guys yeah it looks horrible
80:28 - that's okay though none of the issues
80:29 - okay
80:30 - so look at this it's because here you
80:32 - see this div
80:33 - bro yeah see this div this right here is
80:35 - the user image the image
80:36 - is overflowing um it's 48 pixels the div
80:39 - is 28 pixels gotcha
80:41 - so in order to change the image to be
80:43 - able to to fit the div
80:45 - i simply say image 100 so i simply go
80:48 - this i say please say
80:50 - image and i say width look at this width
80:55 - 100 and i'm ready
81:00 - dude that one was on the drop i know
81:01 - that was the whole goal hey
81:05 - you see you see right there just like
81:07 - that guys it's so simple
81:09 - it's so simple right right there so we
81:11 - got that let's go and now do
81:12 - a few different things let's get a small
81:14 - border for the image i'm gonna say
81:16 - uh border here
81:19 - order two pixel solid
81:22 - solid just give it a small and i'm gonna
81:24 - give white
81:25 - okay okay now this border is there now
81:28 - again it looks still pretty bad that's
81:29 - fine
81:30 - and what i will do with that i will go
81:31 - ahead and say border radius
81:34 - for the radius
81:38 - radius that i use
81:42 - and i will give it border radius of what
81:44 - three pixels
81:46 - save done look at that now it's a border
81:48 - race of three pixels
81:49 - how sick is that huh that's amazing that
81:51 - looks clean
81:52 - it looks clean as heck so is the header
81:55 - done
81:56 - are we getting there oh almost there
81:57 - almost we're getting almost there we're
81:59 - getting there so hold on
82:00 - almost there here's what we're gonna do
82:01 - now what i'm gonna do is pretty simple i
82:03 - will go ahead
82:04 - for the search container you see how
82:05 - there's space in here and here yeah
82:07 - i wanna add that too okay okay ready so
82:10 - here's what i'll do
82:10 - i will add spacing here and here so for
82:13 - the
82:14 - for the search container right here i'm
82:17 - going to give a spacing
82:19 - of 16 pixels so here's what i'll do
82:21 - search container
82:22 - i'm gonna say margin remember how we
82:25 - said the outward one is which one
82:27 - margin margin so i'll say margin margin
82:30 - left
82:31 - is going to be 16 pixels and i'm going
82:34 - to say margin right
82:36 - is going to be 16 pixels as well
82:39 - so now if i see this guy check this out
82:42 - oh
82:43 - let's go you see that we're not done yet
82:46 - oh what else do we got look at this
82:47 - because now we can also now give some
82:49 - spacing for
82:50 - this portion right here you see how this
82:52 - is very close and this is this
82:54 - this like if i if i make this smaller
82:56 - it's going to be another close about
82:56 - let's see right there talk to the mic
82:58 - bro
82:59 - okay sorry so you see how this this
83:02 - right here
83:02 - is so close to the end of the page and i
83:05 - don't like that
83:06 - so here's what i'll do i will go ahead
83:08 - and look at my current
83:10 - main section you see that right there
83:12 - yeah and i will give it some
83:13 - padding as well or margin actually i'll
83:15 - give it a margin of 16 pixels left and
83:17 - 16 pixels right
83:18 - okay here we'll do
83:21 - let's go main where's our main
83:24 - here here right no no not here
83:28 - main i will say margin right
83:31 - right 16 pixels that's not going to
83:33 - change much honestly
83:35 - the margin left of what
83:38 - 16 pixels as well
83:41 - oh you see it's so much cleaner very
83:44 - clean so much cleaner
83:45 - but we're not done yet what else do we
83:49 - do so look so look guys not done yet
83:53 - we're pretty much done but here's the
83:55 - cool part here's where i want to teach
83:56 - you guys something really cool
83:58 - you see how this right here is kind of
83:59 - not centered it's on the left hand side
84:01 - what if i wanted to center
84:02 - these this component but have this
84:05 - component still be on the right-hand
84:06 - side
84:06 - i want to center this fully to be here
84:08 - yeah i have this here
84:10 - um is there like some sort of a line
84:12 - thing like that
84:13 - a line but it's actually better look at
84:16 - this
84:16 - if i say you see look where is our
84:20 - parent component our parent component is
84:21 - what the container correct yes
84:23 - if on the container i say justify
84:25 - content instead of space between let's
84:27 - say i say center
84:31 - see now they're all centered i don't
84:33 - like that
84:34 - so here's what i'll do i'll take this
84:37 - component
84:39 - out of context okay so what i mean by
84:42 - that
84:42 - when i say take something out of context
84:45 - i mean take it
84:46 - take this and make it a ticket outside
84:48 - its own layout
84:51 - so it will actually have its own layout
84:53 - that's really cool you guys ready for
84:54 - this
84:55 - check this out just look at this it's so
84:57 - cool that it like i'm like holy
84:59 - it's so good look at this i go
85:03 - to here nazari and this is the user
85:06 - container
85:07 - on the user container i say something
85:10 - called
85:11 - position absolute
85:16 - okay now and here i say right
85:20 - of zero and on the container i say
85:24 - position relative look at this
85:26 - position relative relative
85:29 - okay user container is not gonna be
85:32 - positioned absolute
85:33 - right zero and look at this now if i say
85:35 - this you write for this
85:36 - i think it already happened oh happened
85:38 - oh what happened look at this
85:40 - you see oh
85:43 - all right look at this guys now it's
85:46 - centered
85:47 - you see but this is always in the right
85:49 - hand section
85:50 - what happened is that we made this
85:52 - absolute
85:54 - to the container so absolute means it's
85:57 - like
85:57 - hey stick stick this for example let's
86:00 - say this is my phone
86:01 - right absolute let's say this right here
86:05 - right there absolute is like this right
86:07 - here or here it's
86:08 - a certain corner and it will always be
86:10 - there no matter what
86:12 - it's like placing pixels in certain
86:14 - situations like
86:15 - placing dots and where you wanna want it
86:17 - to go that's what absolute positioning
86:18 - means
86:19 - comprende make comprehending good all
86:22 - right so cool
86:23 - so we got that portion and look at that
86:24 - this is now centered this is the right
86:26 - hand side
86:26 - ah so good and we are now done with the

88:53 - dash components
88:58 - okay now to create a stock component
89:00 - what you do guys as you guys know this

89:48 - let's go i was going to say gentlemen
89:50 - let's style this sidebar let's go let's
89:52 - go i gotcha
89:54 - all right for the sidebar a few things
89:55 - are going to happen well
89:57 - uh in the sidebar uh of course as you
89:59 - know we have our sidebar looks pretty
90:01 - good
90:01 - let's give it this color you see this
90:03 - but this color right here that's going
90:05 - to be
90:05 - our our our um sidebar
90:08 - so let's give the first a color so i'm
90:11 - going to go to
90:12 - the the side container i'm going to say
90:15 - color
90:16 - right here background i'm gonna give it
90:19 - this background
90:20 - background right there
90:23 - back on three f f three f zero e for
90:26 - zero that's the color of that violet
90:28 - color so oh
90:29 - if i go here boom right there this is
90:31 - the color
90:34 - that's all we need now let me close this
90:36 - out
90:37 - next up you see how this right here in
90:40 - the header we actually added this edit
90:42 - is something called a box shadow but
90:44 - that does not
90:45 - you see this back shutter right here no
90:46 - not this one we added a box shadow for
90:49 - the header which does not show up for
90:51 - some reason and the reason why is
90:52 - because we need to add a z
90:53 - index for this one so we'll say z index
90:57 - see index 10
91:00 - 10 okay the box does not show up because
91:03 - we don't have a box shadow for the
91:04 - header
91:05 - let me see where's the box shadow church
91:07 - oh there it is
91:08 - so link let me get that box guys just
91:10 - kind of copy and paste this box
91:11 - for you guys right here this is just
91:13 - adds a really nice line underneath this
91:15 - you will see what i'm talking about here
91:16 - in a second
91:18 - oh you see it's nice very beautiful
91:20 - right nice
91:21 - and the reason why we did the index 10
91:22 - here guys is because if without this
91:25 - the boxer was underneath the other
91:27 - component you see if i save this
91:29 - you don't you won't really see it oh
91:30 - actually you will never mind so i guess
91:32 - i'm wrong
91:33 - ah i guess you'll see it okay never mind
91:35 - comprende i guess those
91:36 - that works no no problem still so we
91:38 - still have the sidebar though
91:40 - that looks good let's go ahead and give
91:41 - the sidebar uh nothing pretty much
91:44 - let's go ahead and create the components
91:46 - for the sidebar well let's think about
91:47 - what components we need to create well a
91:48 - few things
91:49 - we have this workspace component that's
91:51 - part one okay
91:53 - then we're going to create the threads
91:55 - like these main channels
91:58 - and then we're going to create our own
91:59 - channels make sense
92:01 - make sense so let's create those three
92:03 - components right now actually
92:04 - yeah so do that right now so the first
92:07 - one is going to be
92:08 - the workspace container so here we'll
92:12 - say
92:12 - work work space
92:16 - uh work space
92:19 - container that's the one okay
92:22 - inside that container what do we have
92:24 - guys well we have the name
92:26 - and we have an icon to add it yeah
92:28 - correct so let's do that right now
92:30 - i will say here i will say name
92:33 - and inside the name is gonna be clever
92:35 - programmer
92:37 - that's gonna be the workspace okay guys
92:39 - and then underneath that we'll go ahead
92:41 - and create
92:42 - the new message button that's the new
92:43 - message okay oh okay so we'll say
92:46 - new message
92:49 - new message message boom right there
92:53 - new message and then add new message now
92:56 - that's going to create the the plus icon
92:58 - okay
93:01 - not so good i forget the plus icon
93:05 - right pretty simple so if i go ahead and
93:06 - refresh our app it does not work which
93:09 - is good
93:09 - because we need to create a style
93:10 - components i will say hi const
93:13 - const and i will say simply let's go
93:16 - ahead and do
93:16 - workspace container workspace
93:20 - space container is equal to what guys
93:23 - what is it called
93:24 - style that dip correct boom
93:29 - okay that's saved all good next one is
93:31 - going to be the name
93:32 - also not defined so we'll say right
93:35 - there
93:36 - const name is equal to
93:39 - styled dot dip
93:43 - okay okay all good all good nice
93:47 - next new message const new
93:51 - message is equal to styled dot div
93:56 - right there all right cool look at this
93:59 - we have a programmer right
94:00 - all good now check this out let's go
94:03 - ahead and make this
94:04 - specific portion let's make that white
94:05 - so we'll say color white
94:07 - to make the text white oh
94:10 - look at that that is beautiful as as
94:13 - always
94:14 - and then what i'm going to do is a few
94:15 - things for the royal space container i'm
94:17 - going to give it a
94:18 - height i'm going to say hold on yeah i'm
94:20 - going to give the height because i
94:21 - want to see this at the same time okay
94:23 - so first of all i'm going to work
94:24 - specifically i'm going to say height
94:26 - height of what height of 60
94:30 - ah come on height
94:33 - of 64 pixels boom right there
94:37 - that's the height okay compressing good
94:39 - that's right next up what do we have
94:41 - after the height we have gonna refresh
94:45 - this
94:45 - nothing so with the high what's going to
94:47 - happen is we need to center that you see
94:48 - if i
94:49 - right click inspect demo than this one
94:51 - if i go ahead and
94:52 - look at clear you see this still did
94:54 - right here color white height 64 pixels
94:56 - the height is there because it's
94:57 - highlighting it but clever programmer
94:59 - the text
95:00 - is not centered so what do we do we
95:03 - center it
95:06 - let's go let's do it let's do it so to
95:09 - center it we do display flex
95:12 - okay and just like before what do we use
95:14 - to center it vertically
95:16 - a line a line
95:19 - a line
95:22 - items center oh
95:26 - let's go look at that's beautiful man
95:30 - it's so good guys so good all right
95:34 - let's add some space into the left hand
95:35 - side right here
95:37 - let's add some space into the clutter
95:38 - process we'll say workspace container
95:40 - will say
95:40 - padding left is going to be 19 pixels
95:46 - oh look at that and now let's shift it i
95:48 - see 19 pixels next up
95:50 - for the what for the name icon it's
95:52 - pretty simple
95:53 - well that's the style div now the new
95:55 - message icon let's do that one
95:57 - the new message icon this new master
95:59 - icon will actually contain what
96:02 - the new message icon will contain button
96:05 - eye contact give you the ability to add
96:08 - new messages so let's find one if i go
96:10 - ahead i want to add a new icon let's go
96:12 - ahead and find one let's say new
96:14 - see there's a circle see the circle here
96:16 - the plus circle let's use that let's use
96:17 - that because that signifies you're going
96:19 - to add something you're going to create
96:20 - something new
96:21 - so we'll go ahead and command c this one
96:23 - we'll go back to our react
96:25 - application we'll import our
96:28 - icon boom like here save that icon
96:32 - no problem and now we will do what add
96:38 - add circle outline
96:41 - i'll con icon i know
96:44 - oh let's go now don't worry about this
96:48 - guys we got you
96:49 - now you see how the plus icon is there
96:52 - and it's kind of there
96:53 - correct it's near the clutter programmer
96:54 - sign no problem whatsoever
96:56 - what we're going to do is we're going to
96:58 - do justify content space between to
97:00 - spread them out yes make sense as well
97:02 - do
97:03 - on this one i will say what i will say
97:06 - justify content dash content
97:10 - right space between
97:14 - save that oh let's go and now
97:18 - that's pretty much it now let's add a
97:20 - small border here we'll say border
97:23 - dash bottom and we're going to
97:27 - solid and we'll say actually one pixel
97:30 - solid
97:32 - can you turn on the music oh yes yeah
97:34 - and we'll give it a color of this
97:38 - look at this guys whoa that's the color
97:41 - we'll give it
97:42 - so if i say this oh you see now we have
97:44 - a small border right here
97:45 - that looks pretty cool it's a small
97:47 - border right now it's kind of signifies
97:49 - it more on the
97:50 - on the side of of slack make sense cool
97:52 - good all right cool
97:54 - so now we have that that's all good now
97:56 - for this plus cycling you see how it's
97:57 - like
97:58 - on the right hand side and we wanted to
97:59 - be more kind of like where was it
98:01 - spaced out more space about we'll figure
98:04 - it out here in a second we'll figure
98:05 - that in
98:05 - in a second so now how do we get this
98:08 - white box right here this white circle
98:11 - um
98:12 - will this include maybe creating another
98:14 - styled component well we actually
98:16 - we actually created one it's called a
98:17 - new message
98:21 - i was right ahead of you bro hey you're
98:23 - ready bro
98:24 - this style this style component contains
98:28 - the circle icon yes i will go ahead and
98:31 - do the following in the new message i
98:33 - will say
98:33 - width width of what
98:37 - of 36 pixels
98:42 - 36 pixels and a height
98:45 - of 36 pixels like that like so you see
98:50 - nice so many of you guys are telling me
98:51 - exactly what you said to type that's
98:53 - amazing
98:53 - you guys are epic
98:58 - 600 likes let's go
99:01 - [Music]
99:04 - all right all right beautiful beautiful
99:08 - 600 like that's amazing guys
99:09 - amazing thank you thank you so much yeah
99:11 - cool so we're going to giving you this
99:13 - new message
99:14 - right here see how how it has a height
99:16 - of 36 pixels
99:17 - and a width 360 pixels you see that
99:19 - right there
99:20 - now check this out i will go ahead and
99:22 - say background color white to
99:24 - exactly show you what i mean background
99:27 - and we'll say white
99:30 - oh i know don't worry about it got you
99:32 - bro
99:33 - i got you all right so look in order to
99:36 - change the color of the actual icon
99:39 - i will give it a color and it feel like
99:41 - this
99:44 - boom i saved that oh
99:47 - you see that that's good that changed
99:49 - the color of the icon yeah makes sense
99:51 - good next next up from that
99:55 - let's align and center it horizontally
99:57 - and vertically yes what do you do
99:58 - because it's just off in the corner
99:59 - right now exactly what do we do
100:01 - align items a look good align items but
100:04 - before we do that what do we need to do
100:06 - uh do we need to add any padding remarks
100:08 - no oh man
100:09 - no what do we need to do you tell me
100:12 - um i am out of options bro oh you got
100:15 - this
100:17 - display flex is what we do oh my gosh
100:20 - yeah again i know i will say justify
100:23 - content
100:24 - justify content and we'll say center
100:28 - center and then it will say what a line
100:31 - items
100:32 - oh i'm trying to hit the beat ah no
100:36 - it did not work out
100:37 - so close by two seconds but look you see
100:41 - it centered the whole thing vertically
100:43 - and horizontally the same time perfect
100:45 - now how do we make this portion give it
100:47 - just a little bit more you know i don't
100:49 - know
100:52 - maybe add some margin to this no some
100:54 - nice curves oh some curves yeah that's a
100:56 - nice curve we use that smooth feature
101:00 - let's add a smooth feature so we'll say
101:02 - bordering is smooth
101:05 - no we'll say border radius 50 we'll say
101:07 - border radius
101:10 - radius radius
101:13 - now the reason why it's 50 percent guys
101:14 - is is is for one reason because
101:16 - it's 50 of the whole width of the div
101:20 - right yeah so when you take the whole
101:22 - definition of the whole width of the div
101:24 - right that means it's going to like
101:25 - concave so when
101:27 - it's going to concave fully creating
101:29 - concave fully making it a very nice
101:30 - circle
101:31 - right but that will not have to do much
101:32 - much work at all then at that point
101:34 - what's going to happen is we'll give it
101:36 - a uh what's it called
101:37 - we'll give it a margin right
101:41 - margin right
101:44 - 20 pixels like that good
101:48 - good good hey let's go and then
101:51 - in order to make it an actual button i
101:53 - will say this i will say cursor
101:56 - cursor
101:59 - cursor pointer there we go save that
102:03 - amazing and now if i go and hover over
102:05 - this
102:06 - look at this it becomes oh oh look at
102:09 - that guys so look at what we've just
102:10 - done
102:11 - we have ourselves the header look at
102:13 - this we have ourselves this workspace
102:15 - what is left tell me just the different
102:18 - channels the main channels
102:20 - channels our own channels exactly now
102:23 - for the channel section we're going to
102:24 - do something differently guys
102:26 - we're not going to create these channels
102:28 - all separately like this
102:30 - we're going to be all the react.js smart
102:32 - about it what are we going to do
102:33 - ah so now we're going to see the power
102:35 - of components
102:36 - yes one of these is going to be a
102:39 - component and we can just
102:40 - replicate all these components so
102:44 - in order to replicate that we need to
102:46 - have some kind of a data source that's
102:47 - going to contain that data
102:49 - make sense so here what's up so for now
102:51 - where's this data
102:52 - source gonna be and then where's it
102:54 - gonna be later exactly now before i do
102:55 - that go ahead get some water
102:59 - i don't have water but i'm be joining
103:00 - nas
103:02 - [Music]
103:05 - all right beautiful so a few things guys
103:08 - alright
103:09 - for this section
103:15 - all right for this section we're going
103:17 - to save this data somewhere
103:19 - and necessarily we're going to save this
103:20 - data in in a database
103:22 - not database but like kind of we're
103:24 - going to create a json a javascript file
103:26 - so as we'll do inside source let's
103:29 - create a data section
103:30 - we'll create inside source right here
103:32 - let's do new folder
103:33 - or non-new file let's do a new folder
103:36 - and called
103:37 - data see inside this data
103:40 - we're going to create something called
103:42 - sidebar data
103:44 - so new file sidebar
103:47 - data dot gs and tell them what we're
103:50 - going to do in here
103:51 - we're going to add in that json object
103:54 - yes
103:54 - we're going to create a javascript
103:57 - object
103:57 - that's going to go ahead and contain all
103:59 - the icons and the text for the icons
104:01 - comprende
104:02 - now guys this is only going to be
104:03 - temporary while
104:05 - in part two and part three we're gonna
104:07 - be actually having a database using
104:09 - firebase
104:10 - yes correct correct so if you're
104:11 - wondering we're gonna get to that but
104:12 - today we're gonna keep it static and
104:14 - we're gonna keep it all inside of the
104:15 - project
104:16 - yes so here's what we're gonna do guys
104:17 - i'm going to go ahead and create a
104:19 - project here i will say
104:21 - export i'm going to export an object or
104:24 - an array of objects okay i'll say export
104:26 - const and i will say side
104:29 - bar items okay
104:32 - and this is equal to an array see this
104:35 - array
104:36 - and one inside the array what do we have
104:37 - we have an object
104:39 - and every single object has two
104:41 - attributes
104:42 - it's kind of like an object kind of like
104:44 - attributes kind of like things of what a
104:45 - phone has an attribute of a phone might
104:47 - be
104:47 - things like for example you know the
104:48 - capacity right of the phone right
104:50 - or the look of the phone right no the
104:52 - amount of cameras it has
104:53 - same attributes here in our case the
104:55 - attributes one entry is going to be icon
104:59 - and another one is going to be what text
105:02 - in the text let's say the first one
105:03 - we're going to do is thread so we'll say
105:05 - thread here
105:06 - right now the icon for thread is what
105:09 - uh should we go to the ui
105:12 - materials what's called material ui
105:14 - uh-huh so we'll say here and i will say
105:16 - message i'll say
105:17 - message whoa we got lots of options
105:20 - so we'll use the message icon we'll use
105:22 - this one right here okay right here
105:23 - perfect it's a message
105:24 - i will copy this and i'll paste it into
105:26 - here
105:28 - just like so make sense yes good
105:29 - compared and now i can use the icon i
105:31 - can use
105:32 - i can use the icon like so i can simply
105:34 - do message
105:35 - look at this
105:38 - boom boom you see i have set the message
105:41 - icon as part of the
105:43 - value for the icon attribute comprende
105:46 - yes
105:46 - cool comma now i'm going to do i'm going
105:49 - to copy and paste this
105:50 - everywhere else we'll say copy and like
105:52 - comma paste
105:54 - comma paste comma paste comma
105:57 - paste all good all good all good
106:00 - so now we just have to change the text
106:02 - and these icons yes
106:04 - let's go and do this if we go to our
106:06 - thread we say all dms
106:09 - will say all dms dms
106:13 - okay then we'll say what mentions and
106:16 - reactions right correct so say mentions
106:22 - who let's go mentions and what and
106:25 - reactions
106:29 - reactions okay so then we'll have what
106:31 - save items
106:35 - okay then aside they will have more well
106:40 - that's it makes sense
106:42 - okay now inside here what icon should we
106:45 - use for the old dm's what is this called
106:47 - uh things called inbox
106:51 - inbox yeah you go inbox icon right there
106:54 - that makes sense
106:54 - inbox makes sense okay so we'll use the
106:57 - icon right here
106:58 - boom and now instead of the message icon
107:01 - we'll use the inbox icon like so
107:04 - all we're doing here guys is we're just
107:06 - collecting data or just having an array
107:08 - to be able to save this to be able to
107:10 - loop through it and display the
107:11 - necessary channels that we want
107:13 - make sense make sense hey let's go so we
107:16 - have the inbox icon that's amazing
107:18 - next icon is going to be the let's see
107:22 - dimensions icon that was an interesting
107:24 - one that's going to be the

111:01 - will go ahead and say
111:02 - uh add this is just an example okay
111:06 - so main channels main channel item so
111:09 - main channels it's created style.div so
111:11 - inside here

111:16 - is equal to what daniel style.div
111:19 - [Music]
111:21 - oh let's go okay that's all good
111:26 - the main channels now are going to have
111:27 - a few different scenarios here
111:29 - well few things is going to be one part
111:31 - it's going to be uh
111:32 - display well you don't need to now
111:34 - forget this playfx for now
111:36 - let's now create the main channel item

111:45 - okay is equal to styled.div
111:49 - boom right there you see that right
111:52 - there yes sir now look
111:53 - see now it's here now looks pretty bad
111:56 - won't you say so
111:57 - yes we can make it better it can be so
111:59 - much better so inside the main channel
112:00 - let's go ahead and make that so we'll
112:01 - say here's we'll do
112:02 - we'll save this mini channel we'll say
112:04 - number one here's the color of this
112:07 - here's the color copy this color it's a
112:09 - good color
112:10 - that's the color of the text and that's
112:13 - the color of the icon itself you see
112:14 - that how it's a little
112:15 - i think it's really cool grayish color
112:17 - yeah almost like ccc
112:19 - um almost like but it's not cc yet
112:23 - we were arguing about that for the past
112:25 - for 30 minutes
112:27 - we decided to go with nazi's color yeah
112:28 - yeah it's just so much
112:30 - better all right all right display grid
112:33 - okay display grid okay we're going to
112:36 - use display grid in order to
112:38 - set kind of have this plus size can be
112:39 - on the left hand side and have the odd
112:41 - ad be
112:42 - right here it makes sense make sense so
112:43 - cool so we'll say display grid
112:45 - and we'll say like this we'll say
112:48 - grid template
112:52 - we'll say columns for two columns
112:55 - because again
112:56 - right there are two columns here right
112:58 - one column is this
113:00 - another column is that yes make sense
113:02 - yes good
113:03 - two columns okay and inside here we'll
113:06 - say
113:07 - the first one is going to be 15 percent
113:10 - and the second one has to be what well
113:12 - as before if we wanted to fill out the
113:14 - rest of the space
113:15 - there's a keyword called auto i believe
113:21 - some buffering here looks like this on
113:23 - buffering but it's okay auto
113:24 - okay grid template column let me know
113:27 - let me make sure if it's all good still
113:28 - on youtube by the way
113:29 - uh okay grid template columns 50
113:33 - auto okay cool next up we're going to do
113:35 - is we're going to give
113:36 - it a height so every single item is
113:39 - going to have a height let me say height
113:41 - of what height of
113:44 - of 28 pixels good
113:48 - to give the height nice guys nice nice
113:50 - nice
113:51 - next up after that we have what align
113:54 - item center you see how we currently are
113:56 - like here you see it's not good no but
113:58 - no um so let's let's align item center
114:00 - so let's go ahead and do align items
114:03 - align items
114:06 - center to line at the center oh that's
114:09 - all beautiful
114:11 - next up we'll do padding left to give it
114:13 - a little padding so we'll say
114:14 - padding left left of 19 pixels
114:21 - okay next that's that's the plus icon
114:23 - right here you see that and then what
114:24 - are we going to do
114:25 - and that's pretty much it at that point
114:28 - now we just say cursor
114:30 - cursor pointer
114:34 - and now we have what and now
114:38 - look at that hey let's go
114:42 - so now we have our icon section
114:45 - but hold on we're not done yet could you
114:48 - double check your mic just to make sure
114:49 - everything is good
114:50 - yeah it looks like yeah all is good why
114:53 - okay
114:54 - all right everything's all good two
114:56 - voices it's okay though but it's
114:58 - noticeable
114:58 - okay maybe there's a little bit of an
115:00 - echo somewhere it might be maybe from
115:01 - your mic as well we'll see
115:02 - all right i'll uh i'll i'll get away
115:05 - from you okay
115:06 - bye-bye i'll do the margin margins right
115:09 - the space between them margin right on
115:11 - this guy all right i'll just point it
115:12 - this way hopefully that figures out here
115:14 - hopefully okay cool so guys so we got
115:16 - that specific section all good no
115:18 - problem
115:19 - that's on the cursor pointer after that
115:21 - what's going to happen
115:22 - is now we're pretty much got done guys
115:25 - we're pretty much
115:26 - now done we are so close only a few
115:29 - things left
115:30 - look we have this first one right here
115:31 - okay we have this first one right here
115:33 - now all we have to do is need to how to
115:37 - is we need to import the data we use
115:39 - from the last one
115:40 - and loop through it so how do we do that
115:42 - well here's what we're going to do
115:44 - we're going to import like this i'm
115:47 - going to say
115:49 - import look at this
115:52 - import sidebar items data from
115:55 - data sidebar data why because if i go
115:59 - ahead okay
116:00 - if i look in my section right i'm
116:03 - curling the sidebar section okay
116:05 - here i'm currently here i need to do i
116:07 - need to get out of that folder i need to
116:09 - go to components
116:10 - right and you go to source that's what
116:12 - this dot slash means
116:13 - then i need to go back to data which is
116:15 - here and
116:16 - then go to cyber data gs and that my
116:18 - friends is how i go ahead
116:20 - and access this portion and i simply
116:22 - import this specific section make sure
116:23 - nice that makes sense
116:25 - cool so now we have that but here's what
116:27 - we can do you see how we have this one
116:29 - specific main channel
116:30 - check this out i will say this
116:34 - or you can use something called jsx i
116:35 - mean this is all jsx just so you know
116:37 - but i'm gonna do sidebar
116:41 - dot map that map is going to
116:44 - loop through every oh my god oh my god
116:48 - drink more water please
116:54 - okay it's going to loop through every
116:56 - single
116:57 - item so that map then what's going to
117:00 - happen and i'm going to say like this
117:02 - item pom-pom okay and inside here now
117:07 - i will do the following i'm going to
117:09 - actually create the html for it
117:11 - check this out inside this one i'm not
117:14 - going to say you see how i had this
117:15 - specific portion it's going to copy this
117:16 - one
117:17 - and paste it where it pasted into here
117:19 - boom
117:20 - all we did is i simply copied and pasted
117:23 - that specific section the main channel
117:25 - item and the circle portions
117:27 - make sense look at that make sense to me
117:29 - man okay now
117:31 - because we're looking through every
117:32 - single item we are getting the icon and
117:34 - the text for every item
117:37 - inside here as you're looping through
117:38 - every item is going to have the icon
117:40 - and text yes okay so here's what we'll
117:42 - do
117:43 - we're going to replace this icon with
117:45 - simply just simply item
117:46 - that what what
117:51 - icons oh and replace this one with what
117:55 - items dot text that text
117:59 - because each item has an icon exactly so
118:02 - now guys check this out
118:04 - if i now save this if i now save this
118:08 - what's going to happen if i say this
118:10 - right now you ready for this
118:12 - are you ready
118:15 - are you ready are you ready
118:19 - 634 likes guys let's get to 700. love
118:21 - you all so much you ready for this
118:25 - [Music]
118:30 - look what happened bro
118:34 - all right now there's no more buildups
118:35 - that's disappointing
118:37 - let's fix this oh it's fine it's okay
118:39 - look so
118:40 - site import error sidebar items data is
118:42 - not exported from data sidebar data
118:44 - it's okay we'll fix it export but it is
118:47 - export that's interesting part
118:48 - it is exported here that doesn't make
118:49 - sense so we have that
118:52 - let me see if i go to sidebar data
118:54 - export const
118:56 - that's the thing is it is exported
119:01 - um let me see start with the gs import
119:04 - error
119:06 - and export it from guys as developers
119:09 - this always happens you're gonna have to
119:11 - figure out you know there's a
119:12 - semicolon somewhere where it shouldn't
119:14 - be there's just something weird and wonk
119:16 - in the code
119:17 - what nas is doing right now is at high
119:19 - technical proficiency he's looking for
119:21 - this bug
119:22 - this bug that is living somewhere inside
119:24 - of his code that's telling it
119:26 - i think i know why actually i think i
119:28 - misspelled sidebar items data ah
119:31 - sometimes oh let's go simple misspell
119:35 - and look at this now let's go and now we
119:38 - have ourselves
119:39 - all the items you see we had one now we
119:42 - have all of them because we loop through
119:43 - them

122:38 - guys we're almost here
122:40 - let's go ahead and do this in order to
122:41 - convert these channels to be what
122:43 - horizontally
122:44 - horizontally what what do we do i think
122:45 - we said a couple times
122:48 - so we'll do what we'll say display flex
122:50 - lex
122:51 - let's play flags and now this becomes
122:53 - what
122:54 - oh let's go let's add the same color not

123:17 - go ahead and do the following i'll go
123:19 - ahead and look at this
123:21 - for the channels container i'm going to
123:22 - also add a margin top
123:24 - margin desktop of 10 pixels
123:28 - okay save that that's gonna push a
123:29 - little more at the bottom then
123:31 - what do we do in order to spread these
123:33 - this right here away
123:35 - what do we do a space between
123:38 - so i will say this i will say justify oh
123:43 - i will say justify content justify
123:47 - content
123:49 - space between
123:53 - oh let's go i'm going to now vertical
123:56 - line how do i do that guys
123:58 - with the align aligned items
124:02 - i know there's so much css going on it's
124:04 - crazy then we're going to go ahead and
124:06 - do what
124:07 - i'm going to give it a height as well
124:08 - i'm going to say height
124:11 - of 28 pixels just so that it has its own
124:13 - little height thingy
124:14 - okay 20 pixels beautiful and then i'm
124:16 - going to give it a penny left or 19
124:18 - pixels but so kind of because i wanted
124:19 - to align you see
124:20 - i want to align together with everything
124:22 - here you see that yep i want to align
124:24 - so i will say here padding dash left
124:27 - is equal to what boom
124:30 - save that oh let's go beautiful nice

124:42 - do is the following
124:44 - is any left let's go edit padding right
124:46 - for that plus icon so pending right
124:50 - right and we'll give that one to 12
124:51 - pixels
124:54 - and that's pretty much it we've got the
124:56 - channels now
124:57 - let's create the individual channel bro
125:00 - let's do that
125:00 - all right now for the individual channel
125:03 - it's going to be called
125:04 - we're going to create a new container
125:05 - called channels list
125:07 - channels list right here boom channels
125:10 - list okay
125:11 - all right somebody said i smashed two
125:15 - i smashed the like button so many times
125:16 - at this point it's insane wow
125:18 - thank you thank you i mean appreciate
125:20 - you guys hopefully you could smash it
125:21 - more
125:22 - yeah likes before the end of this one
125:24 - can we get to 700 likes bro
125:26 - i don't know man before the end of this
125:28 - live call we're almost there when we
125:30 - finish this

125:36 - finish this by the time he does
125:38 - let's get 700 guys let's get it let's
125:40 - get it let's get it cool so we get the
125:42 - channels list
125:42 - in the channel it does come with a
125:44 - container for individual channels so
125:45 - here i will say for example
125:47 - individual channel is going to be like
125:48 - this some say channel
125:51 - channel now
125:55 - what i want you to pay attention to what
125:57 - do you see in terms of these
125:59 - components like main channel item and
126:01 - channel which i'm going to
126:02 - reuse it here again what do you see here
126:05 - they have some sort of
126:06 - data that we're giving them yes but what
126:08 - else
126:09 - i mean what else do you want me to see
126:11 - bro what
126:14 - what do you see and how these components
126:16 - are being used
126:17 - oh they're being reused yes you see
126:20 - these style components guys right here
126:21 - channel right right channel channel
126:24 - right
126:25 - it's the same component same name same
126:28 - component it's like you're taking the
126:29 - exact same
126:30 - iphone right but duplicating it one more
126:32 - time you see what i mean duplicating it
126:34 - so same thing here if i go for example
126:37 - to the main channel item
126:39 - right where you we're using the same
126:41 - component
126:42 - and we're looping through every single
126:43 - item and just adding the same component
126:45 - to after that item
126:46 - oh here oh sorry yeah right here right
126:49 - there see guys
126:50 - that's what i'm trying to say that's the
126:52 - whole goal with with
126:53 - mink with components channel channel
126:57 - same component
126:59 - reuse the exact same time makes it
127:01 - easier for you
127:02 - makes it easier for me as a developer
127:04 - makes it easier for the whole wide world
127:08 - same thing same thing okay awesome so
127:10 - now
127:11 - two channels now of course let's go
127:12 - ahead and create those two channels if i
127:15 - get a channel let's create a style.div
127:17 - so i'm gonna say neutral container
127:18 - and i will say const what is it channels
127:23 - channels list is equal to style.div
127:28 - okay okay and i will say channel
127:33 - of the financial as well some say const
127:36 - channel
127:37 - is equal to what
127:41 - let's go okay we got that now it still
127:44 - looks hideous that's okay
127:46 - on the channels actually guys we're
127:47 - almost done guys 700 likes guys
127:50 - so so close till the end here's what
127:53 - we'll do individual
127:54 - channel is going to have a height right
127:57 - a height of what 28 pixels
128:00 - then then we're going to say for example
128:02 - this we're going to vertically align
128:03 - them
128:04 - let's do that we'll say display flex
128:07 - flex okay then we'll say align item
128:10 - center to vertically align
128:11 - with this say align items
128:15 - center okay then we'll say what padding
128:18 - left to move it from the
128:19 - left hand side what how do we say this
128:21 - guys what do we do here you move it from
128:22 - the right left-hand side margin
128:24 - or padding oh we can do margin two
128:25 - actually it doesn't matter okay
128:27 - margin-left
128:28 - actually okay let's do margin here i'll
128:31 - show you why margin is not good here
128:32 - but let's do margin for now i'll show
128:34 - you a second while mod is not good here
128:36 - you can color the background makes sense
128:38 - make sense all right margin left no no
128:40 - no no i want to show to them margin left
128:41 - 19 pixels
128:43 - 19 pixels boom okay
128:46 - okay so look it pushed it 90 pixels no
128:48 - problem correct all right awesome
128:50 - so now look this is sick this is all
128:53 - good display flex
128:54 - no problem whatsoever right let's go do
128:57 - do cursor pointing to make sure that we
128:58 - can click on it
129:01 - pointer okay so if i hover over this now
129:04 - it's a cursor now
129:05 - one really cool thing we can add is when
129:06 - you hover over it it will actually
129:07 - change
129:08 - color so here's how we can do this guys
129:10 - if i hover over on this look at this i
129:12 - can say hover
129:14 - hover hover i can actually change the
129:18 - background color to this
129:19 - so on the hover of this channel button i
129:22 - can change that
129:23 - so i can change the background color so
129:25 - i can say oh
129:26 - let's go you see as i hover over it but
129:29 - with the margin
129:30 - well look at this because we set the
129:31 - margin remember what i said about the
129:33 - margin guys
129:34 - this is where you had the issue with
129:36 - margin and padding i mean the difference
129:37 - between margin padding right
129:39 - yes what do i say margin is outside
129:42 - margin is the outside of the component
129:44 - itself that's margin
129:46 - padding is the inside that's interesting
129:50 - oh
129:53 - okay cool so that's so look at this if
129:56 - we want to include the change of the
129:58 - background color right
129:59 - but still create space what do we like
130:01 - to use then padding
130:02 - padding on margin so instead of doing
130:05 - margin i'm gonna say penny left
130:10 - 19 pixels and look at that oh
130:14 - let's go you see it's so it's so clean
130:16 - and nice
130:17 - yes okay let's do the same thing with
130:19 - these threads can we do that too
130:22 - these right here main channel item we'll
130:24 - say the same thing here we'll say hover
130:26 - hover also they will go ahead and also
130:28 - have a background color change
130:30 - on them as well okay
130:33 - save that oh
130:38 - let's go guys
130:41 - look at this we are pretty much
130:44 - done for day one of the react gs
130:47 - challenge

130:54 - ourselves a
130:56 - what a header it looks so good you can
130:59 - type in the header if you want to
131:01 - we have ourselves a sidebar that looks
131:03 - so good and so clean
131:05 - so fresh so clean that's impossible to
131:08 - look at
131:08 - oh you have channels and so forth this
131:11 - right here is dynamic
131:12 - it's so cool but guess what it's going
131:15 - to get
131:15 - even even better as move on to day two
131:18 - and day three
131:19 - now guys at this point guys if you are

131:44 - do you want to do no i have to show it
131:46 - on myself so number one let's go and do
131:49 - this
131:50 - here for the homework i actually do here

132:10 - this point you could
132:11 - watch the replay that it's going to be
132:12 - available day one
132:15 - and finish day one yes completely so you
132:17 - have to be able to have an app just like
132:19 - this
132:20 - no problem okay part two
132:23 - here's what i want you to do for part
132:24 - two i want you remember how we
132:26 - made these right here elements kind of
132:29 - dynamic by creating a list a data list
132:31 - yes i want you guys do the same thing in
132:34 - the channels
132:35 - so convert channels
132:38 - to be dynamic and come
132:41 - from a list okay so you could look at
132:45 - the code above
132:46 - where you had the loop mapping things
132:48 - yeah create a json object with your
132:50 - channels
132:51 - yes and boom exactly you do that okay
132:54 - part three what should you give them for
132:56 - part three what do you think
133:00 - something something in terms of design i
133:02 - would say so
133:03 - [Music]
133:05 - i have an idea actually i have an idea
133:06 - okay what's the idea here's the idea i
133:08 - think what you guys should do because
133:09 - here they at the end of our
133:11 - at the end of all this our goal is to be
133:12 - able to you know
133:14 - to have no this basically designed what
133:16 - i want you guys to do
133:17 - is i want to go ahead and
133:21 - actually and actually i'm just thinking
133:24 - here
133:25 - [Music]
133:28 - for i want you to start on this section
133:31 - right here i want you to go ahead and
133:33 - guys
133:34 - create this actually no create this
133:37 - header section right here see this
133:38 - header section
133:39 - yeah in the chat box yes
133:43 - create this header section in the chat
133:45 - box that's all you need to do
133:46 - you need to create this inside the chat
133:48 - component inside the chat component guys
133:50 - make sense
133:51 - set the chat component that's pretty
133:52 - much it so let me go and type this out
133:54 - again
133:55 - okay create
133:58 - the the header
134:01 - in the chat component
134:05 - like above like
134:08 - that's it guys that's all you need to do
134:10 - and if you can
134:12 - and here's a has a bonus point here's a
134:14 - bonus point
134:15 - for four four
134:18 - if you can convert this
134:22 - for example to be the dark mode
134:25 - to have dark mode so let's say maybe i
134:28 - have curly light mode on
134:29 - but maybe there's a dark mode meaning
134:31 - you have to change the colors of all of
134:32 - these
134:33 - let's say for example change the colors
134:36 - of all of these you know
134:37 - sidebar the header and so forth can want
134:39 - this to have
134:40 - dark mode so forth or your own mode
134:45 - maybe you want to have a different
134:46 - colors for slack whatever colors you
134:48 - want to use for slack
134:49 - use it for yourself right be creative
134:51 - with it right maybe you want to use
134:52 - dark and white maybe you want to use
134:54 - green you know it's blue who knows
134:56 - but change it to your own color okay you
134:58 - have dark mode or your own
135:00 - mode right so if you want that's up to
135:03 - you make sense

137:09 - we'll go
137:10 - in the meantime if you have any
137:11 - questions feel free to drop it down
137:13 - below and we'll ask any questions you
137:14 - have right now in the chat so you have
137:16 - any questions
137:16 - let me go and take a look at them what
137:18 - do we have well the discord channel be
137:20 - deleted after
137:21 - the challenge uh we're not sure about
137:23 - that that just yet maybe maybe not
137:26 - that's something we'll look but just in
137:27 - case reach out to people
137:28 - make friends network with people inside
137:30 - of this challenge
137:31 - so that you can start to build a
137:33 - community of your own
137:35 - of people who are like-minded and are
137:36 - programming as well just network
137:38 - guys be positive be optimistic right be
137:40 - nice to other people
137:42 - that's why that's why being being
137:43 - positive is so important in comments
137:45 - right because
137:46 - if you're a shitty person in the
137:47 - comments you're probably shitty person
137:49 - in
137:49 - real life too so and you probably won't
137:51 - make any friends and you won't make any
137:52 - connections and you have
137:53 - a very sad life i'm sorry that's just
137:56 - the s that's the truth of it you'll have
137:57 - a very sad life if you're very negative
138:00 - i know i said it you don't like it i'm
138:03 - sorry
138:03 - but that's the truth okay you hate uh
138:06 - things you you make mean comments
138:08 - you're not gonna have a good life period
138:10 - okay so when that's the technical
138:11 - question
138:12 - why do we use style.div instead of dot
138:14 - css is it better practice
138:17 - so style.div is how you guys create a
138:19 - div
138:20 - css is a separate file so if you want to
138:24 - create a css you'll create a css file
138:26 - and that's where you go ahead and add
138:27 - your css in our case we're using style
138:29 - components
138:30 - which allows us to actually for example
138:33 - if you could take a look at this if i
138:34 - let me kind of open up vs code
138:36 - right there you see style.div is kind of
138:39 - like declaring your own component
138:41 - with a style so it's a different way of
138:45 - creating styles and creating components
138:47 - korean styles uh so it's a little bit
138:49 - different but style div
138:50 - is is the kind of the you know the
138:53 - normal you can also do style
138:54 - style that span if you wanted to style
138:56 - that span and you know
138:58 - any other html element you want to do
138:59 - but in our case it's just div
139:01 - boom so listen to nas he's the master we
139:03 - have another question saying
139:04 - for the dark mode as part of the
139:06 - homework can we reference the portfolio
139:09 - or do we just use another js library or
139:12 - code it ourselves
139:13 - uh good question so for you guys what i
139:15 - would say so here let me go ahead
139:17 - um i want to brought it bring it up in
139:20 - the comments
139:21 - oh it was a mail right there
139:24 - right there yeah so for this one i would
139:26 - say just change up the color just change
139:28 - the background color of your css okay
139:31 - you don't have to like have a toggle or
139:32 - anything like that if you want to
139:34 - reference
139:34 - you know your portfolio that's fine but
139:36 - i would say don't reference it i would
139:37 - say
139:38 - just try to do it by yourself that's
139:39 - gonna be the you know your biggest way
139:41 - of learning
139:42 - um just change the background color of
139:44 - your left sidebar and the header
139:46 - and that's it and now you have dark mode
139:48 - you know it's as simple as that
139:49 - and if you want you can even change the
139:50 - color of the chat as well off your chat
139:52 - window
139:53 - so again this is where you get to be
139:54 - creative so we have muhammad asking the
139:57 - question
139:58 - can i get a job with this challenge
140:00 - project
140:01 - so so solely yes and no
140:04 - if this is your first project guys and
140:06 - this is your first experience
140:08 - in reactgs maybe not right guys this
140:11 - takes some time to
140:13 - build out yes we've had some people
140:15 - who've gotten projects or have gotten
140:16 - jobs right after doing the challenge
140:18 - and right after even right just by
140:20 - teaching people or just getting
140:21 - another job right but this is a career
140:25 - it's a career it's gonna last you for
140:26 - the next 10 20 30
140:28 - years of course it's not gonna take you
140:31 - ten days or five days to build it i'm
140:33 - sorry it's just not the case
140:34 - you're going to have to put in more time
140:36 - you're going to have to put more
140:38 - projects
140:39 - more of your time and more of your
140:41 - energy into it and then you'll get the
140:43 - job but if you're just starting out just
140:45 - from zero
140:46 - this is a way to kick-start your career
140:48 - as a re-igs developer right
140:50 - to go to get your interest into it to
140:52 - say holy
140:54 - there is possibility in it there's
140:56 - abilities in terms of what i
140:58 - can do in terms of what others can do
141:00 - and in terms of how i
141:02 - can change my life that's what this is
141:05 - for
141:05 - boom boom boom boom yes all right so we
141:07 - have another question that says
141:09 - how does a homework or does a homework
141:10 - have to be submitted well
141:12 - guys if you want to be part of the
141:13 - prizes that we have your homework does
141:16 - have to be submitted because that's
141:17 - going to be taken into consideration if
141:18 - you're engaging with the community
141:20 - not only that you can also start to get
141:22 - some feedback because if you're not
141:23 - getting feedback it's hard to know if
141:25 - you're making
141:26 - awesome progress or not yes exactly 100
141:28 - so yes i met the homework guys i will
141:30 - give you the link in the facebook post

141:34 - can you uh says how to make this
141:36 - responsive we'll go over making a slide
141:38 - responsive later on guys don't worry
141:39 - about that just yet okay
141:42 - not just yet let me see okay what other
141:45 - question we have guys let me
141:46 - just put this here oh someone was asking
141:48 - this a lot
141:50 - we are at 697 likes bro what let's go
141:54 - 7. can we get to 700 come on 697 likes
141:58 - 700 likes 98. come on
142:03 - 698. we need two more 6.99
142:07 - i don't have 99. can we get to 200 or
142:09 - 700 no come on
142:11 - 700 likes guys you guys got this what
142:14 - 700 700
142:15 - and we are 700 likes let's go
142:25 - [Music]
142:30 - but he kept asking and i think that's a
142:32 - good point explain
142:34 - why i use the inspect tool because i see
142:35 - that you use that a lot and as a
142:37 - developer is that important knowledge
142:38 - yeah so inspector is actually really
142:40 - cool too guys check this out
142:42 - inspector is what allows us to get
142:44 - insight into how
142:45 - web pages are built right so for example
142:48 - let's say i go to node.js site okay just
142:51 - an example site here right
142:53 - all right let's just say google.cool.com
142:54 - this might be even better
142:57 - that's not google.com hold on hold on
143:00 - right there
143:01 - come on oh my gosh i know oh my gosh
143:04 - indeed
143:04 - so if i right click on the spectrum on
143:06 - this one look at this guys you see
143:07 - i inspect the element and this tells me
143:10 - things like okay
143:11 - here's the hide the image here right
143:13 - here we have the css right here so let
143:15 - me go ahead and this right here for
143:18 - example is this
143:19 - css right so this is such a cool part
143:21 - about with this because
143:23 - i can see what other developers are
143:26 - doing and how they are creating these
143:27 - things right object fit contain
143:29 - max height max width and so forth and i
143:32 - can not only learn from that i can copy
143:34 - it just for my learning purposes as well
143:36 - so inspect them is a very very useful
143:38 - tool right i can look at okay
143:40 - well how are these this being pretty see
143:42 - we have this one div that's a header
143:43 - right
143:44 - boom another div that's the google's
143:46 - logo
143:47 - then another div right here for example
143:50 - let's say this is the google logo
143:51 - another if that's the input
143:52 - you see it saw such a useful tool that i
143:55 - can learn from
143:56 - non-stop not only that it makes it easy
143:59 - to kind of test things because here i've
144:01 - seen nas
144:01 - change the styles to see how things
144:04 - change right like there he could change
144:05 - the pattern so guys for example
144:06 - for example sorry so yeah sorry actually
144:09 - go hiking
144:09 - whatever i mean literally you could just
144:11 - go to the styles that's all it's saying
144:12 - and you could change it
144:13 - and you could see what it would look
144:14 - like so it's a quick way to debug as
144:16 - well
144:16 - so for example if i do background color
144:18 - on here guys look at that i can actually
144:19 - change it in line
144:20 - for you for color for uh for google i
144:22 - can see back on color
144:24 - whoa did he just change google.com hey
144:27 - here we go
144:28 - now google.com is more like
144:30 - collaborative programmers yeah go to
144:31 - google.com right now and you'll see it's
144:32 - going to be orange no it's not actually
144:35 - orange because this is only in line this
144:36 - is only on my local machine
144:38 - if you go to yourgoogle.com it's going
144:39 - to be the exact one that
144:41 - it comes from and another thing is you
144:43 - can also if you click on that
144:45 - the very left button and you click on
144:47 - something on the computer it takes you
144:49 - to exact place
144:50 - of the code so it's easy to find
144:52 - wherever it is that you're looking
144:54 - for for example this is a search icon
144:55 - you can see this is the search icon
144:57 - right here if you want to look at the
144:58 - input the title whatever that is
145:00 - you could just click on it on the screen
145:01 - and it takes you to the exact place
145:03 - on code so it's very easy to debug using
145:05 - inspect tool oh
145:06 - same thing here right okay for example
145:08 - this button right here i'm gonna click
145:09 - on this button
145:10 - and this takes me to the button right
145:11 - here see this input button so simple
145:14 - right simple so this is why we use the
145:16 - inspect element tool
145:18 - as a developer i highly recommend you
145:19 - start to get used to it
145:21 - um and just start using it for your own
145:24 - good and just
145:24 - testing it out seeing what you can do as
145:27 - developer
145:28 - change things up hey go to facebook
145:30 - change some things up on facebook make
145:31 - it make it crazy make it fancy okay
145:33 - and of course this is only locally one
145:34 - you when you're like if i refresh this
145:36 - right now guys if i refresh this
145:38 - it's going back to normal to white right
145:39 - so of course so i'm not actually
145:41 - changing
145:41 - permanently i'm changing temporarily and
145:44 - that's
145:45 - where you want to use inspect exactly
145:47 - next question next question all right
145:49 - guys
145:49 - let's take just a couple more few more
145:52 - because
145:52 - we've been going at this and we want you
145:54 - guys to get on it and do the homeworks
145:57 - so tomorrow you could show up ready for
145:58 - part two yes i think pretty much at this
146:00 - point
146:01 - we're done guys okay at this point i
146:03 - think
146:04 - why do you sometimes amanda dev listen
146:07 - to put the
146:08 - subject so that's a good question
146:11 - actually
146:12 - so why do i put the semicolon and
146:13 - sometimes i don't put a semicolon
146:15 - why do you think that's the case well
146:18 - it depends it just
146:21 - depends how i feel it depends if nas is
146:24 - feeling it
146:25 - yeah so the semicolon you guys in
146:27 - javascript especially in the beginning
146:29 - you had to put semicolons at the end of
146:30 - the each line and so it was like a
146:33 - standard right
146:34 - uh now at this point it's not so much of
146:35 - a standard you don't have to put
146:36 - semicolons at the end of each line
146:38 - it's like basically it depends on how i
146:39 - feel about it it's you know i have a
146:41 - habit of doing it but sometimes i forget
146:43 - to do it
146:44 - uh because now at this point in
146:46 - javascript it is not the most important
146:48 - thing so
146:49 - you can put in anything you want
146:50 - potentially without the semicolon so
146:52 - yeah i think you only need the semicolon
146:54 - if you put a couple lines of code
146:56 - on the same line yes but that's that's
146:58 - bad code anyway so don't do that
147:00 - yeah yeah so yeah so that's the only
147:01 - reason make sense all right so
147:04 - guys that's pretty much it
147:07 - so guys guys oh if you feel semicolon
147:11 - jody is like that's actually funny he
147:12 - says i'm a sema colonistic
147:16 - he adds it anyways guys that case
147:20 - thank you all so much for watching
147:23 - thank you so much for joining us for
147:25 - coding along with us

let me just give you a a very small kind of um demo sign in with google so you you will actually be able to sign in with google look at this sign on google as long as you have good wifi hopefully loads which which apparently we have slow wifi but it's all good it's all good clever point.com right there cool and look at that this right here is your slack clone fully built from scratch in three days three days that's it three days and today's day one guys yes tres diaz right i said that right yeah exactly so what are we going to dive into in day one what are the things that so let's think about this okay let's take a look well before that look at this guys if you can chat i can chat whatever i wanted to right as i'm chatting i can go different repositories look at this i can actually create new channels if i wanted to let's say clever programmer clever there's a channel you see now i have a channel and again all this stuff is saved in database look at this and multiple people can also be doing this at the same time so it's like real time chatting how cool is that man it's amazing awesome so again guys don't forget yes you will go ahead you can tell them it's another reminder guys that here there will be winners of three amazing prices that we have the first one will be a free enrollment for a six month online called full stack mastery worth 17 000 the second one you're gonna get all of the clever programmer courses at your hands at least three thousand dollars worth of value and the third one is you're gonna get free access to profit with javascript which is the best javascript course on the planet boom period period done i don't have to say anything else so how can you win nas so how can you win be qui uh great question so guys very important be positive if you're in the chat if you're negative we're going to throw you out it's as simple as that just block bye bye sayonara baby okay so be positive engage in the chat don't spam okay that's one really important part yes we do look for in terms of how you how you engage how you comment that's very important but if you do it too much if you just copy and paste no bueno we're gonna throw you out i'm sorry so participate in all five days of course make sure your five days you are there do the homework important common sense yeah yes make the full project and if you add extra features you get yourself a bonus right so we like to see people who try to go over the top who try harder who do things extra that's always a really nice bonus exactly so if you're ready to do it if you're gonna play all out if you're here focused and present go ahead and tell us below that you are in it to win guys let us know and also smash that like button for the youtube algorithm guys let's go ahead and help us out right now let's get to 200 likes we are currently at 170 likes i'm sure we'll get to 200 in a split second here come on guys 170 one let's get to 180 190 guys come on come on like it right now like it right now and we'll make sure that we get to 200. cool so leave a comment in the comments if you are pumped i'm with you right now right here let's get to it oh all right one more thing guys before we dive in let's just give you guys the agenda again one more time so yesterday was day one today will be day two now we could go ahead and hit that next slide so we could show them and in day two we're gonna start to build the slack clone right so we're gonna add different features that nas gonna dive into right now we're gonna be talking about how to create the header how to create the sidebar and then we're gonna go on to day three day four day five and finally day six where we have a special support what's the surprise man you might have to kind of wait and see what we're doing in day six not telling the surprise don't even think about it without further ado man shall we get started let's oh it's show time i think we missed the drop did we no i did not no no no i don't know why nas makes me do this come on you know it i know go go ready ready with us everybody right now ready all right we're done guys we're done that's it guys all right let's get straight that's always so much fun man i love that that's beautiful all right so really quick guys so that's it part one that's it now let's go straight into the slack clone okay let's get serious let's go ahead and sit down we'll quiet down we'll chill for a second here right um our goal today is to build that slack project now what are we going to be building okay our goal is to get to this portion right here you see how currently we have for example a header window we have a sidebar this is our goal for today guys okay just pretty simple that's me part one now if you think about creating any project guys let's just think about a little bit in a few ways okay so let me go ahead and zoom in here so you guys see when you create a project like for example like any website what do you think about daniel what do you think about well first when i'm trying to get started i want to think about what is this structure going to look like what are the things that i'm going to have to put in place to start to put this website correct right always the structure it's kind of like you're building guys you're kind of like you're building a building right when you build a building you're building a structure you have an architecture a piece of paper correct and that builds the structure of the building right i'm not doesn't build it but it's an architecture foundation so let's go and build the architecture right now so if you can see this is the slack clone now this is a part one of it what do you see well what do you see right now is pretty simple we have here a header okay right and this header has multiple components part one is a has like this for example this icon component right here it has this input right here correct for searching yep it has this question mark right here for a question right and it has kind of like a this kind of component for your username correct okay next on the left hand side you have a sidebar right here you see the sidebar in the sidebar you have things like some channels you have your workspace workspace name and you have your channel right here channel number one child number two and so forth yep right so all these things that you guys are seeing right here where i'm highlighting those are called components and why do we call them components we call them components because i don't know can i use these in different parts of the uh software system yes exactly that's the really cool part about us because you can reuse them in multiple parts of your piece of software right okay so i can take for example i can take this for example this component and i can reuse it where here and here and here and here and everywhere and so forth so it becomes like a little lego block it's like a lego you could use to build something because it's the same four by four lego blocks two by four okay exactly exactly pretty cool right make sense okay and then on the right hand side right here we have a chat window so we're gonna make that chat one that that's going to be later on as we go to part day two and day three and so forth okay perfect yes but for now let's focus on now really quickly okay guys okay if you think about all these different things we have what this chat okay yes we said that we had this sidebar we said that now the sidebar you see how it's all kind of rows and columns there you always have to structure your things in rows and columns so you can see we have one row here that's the header correct what's another row i would assume the other row would be the rest of it right which includes the sidebar and the main bar correct so the rest of it which includes those see now this becomes its own little component it's a little div we call the div container guys okay now inside that that's when you have the sidebar and that's when you have the chat because now those are columns yeah like i can't go from from rows to columns like just kind of interweedly i have to create rows within columns and columns within rows that make sense does that make sense that makes sense cool so we have that right now let's just go ahead and create that pretty much that's all we now need to do let's create that right now perfect all right so if we go ahead i'm going to put my uh on the right hand side right here all right so of course guys to just get this started you guys need to install node.js just for those of you who don't have it nodejs right here make sure you still know gs.org download it right here if you don't have it just install it no problem if you have it great for you and of course this code is our choice of code editor and as a reminder guys if you happen to get stuck in any part of these parts it's totally fine just keep listening keep watching keep being engaged so you can make sure you're learning and you can always watch the replay so that as the homework you can catch up and add even cooler features yes exactly exactly so again this there's going to be a replay so if you just cannot cannot catch up just you know don't worry just watch the video awesome so now let's go ahead and do this you have you have no no yes if you're on mac open up terminal if you're on windows i think it's powershell i think it's what's called is that what it's called or the command prompt command prompt i'm not sure i'm not i'm not a windows user [Laughter] anyways guys let's go ahead and do ls here i'm going to go into a project folder i have called github okay and what i'm going to do is i'm going to create a project using node.js with something called create react app now what that does is this sets up your whole project for a react application so of course you first need to install node.js which hopefully should have done now at this point let me go ahead and make this a little larger so you guys can see it right there let me go ahead and do a command k so you guys have it so now i'm github what i do is i npx and i say create dash react dash app right there and all i have to say now this point is what the name of the application yeah so let's go ahead and do this we'll say it um slack clone challenge how does that sound that sounds good to me challenge it's good okay so what's going to happen now is it's going to create our application and px node.js is creating this app fully from scratch it is creating the structure of the application most importantly and we'll use the structure to build on top of it makes sense perfect all right one one one all right let's go ahead we're doing this let's go it's currently doing other stuff and guys by the way looks like we are currently at 284 likes let's get to 300 likes come on like it up share it up pump it up let's go um like it up share it up let's go i'm even putting a like right here so we could get to 300. hey let's go we're currently at 286 guys a and we have ourselves a what a slack line you can see it's done it says when you see happy hacking it means you are all good my friends okay okay so happy hacking we have that next thing you want to do is open up these codes i'm going going to do a file a new window here on my vs code prompt i have my views code right here you can see okay all right and what's going to happen at this point is pretty simple all i will say is i will do file open let's do open i will go to the projects let's go ahead a github project right here slack clone challenge this is where i created i created my folder right here correct let's see this is our creative folder so open up that folder click open that's the whole folder where you just create your project click open boom there you go awesome so you have your project so let's take a look at what do you have now with this project i'm going to put on the left hand side so you guys can see it make this a little larger so you guys can see it as well right there beautiful everybody comprehending everybody good and we have ourselves a super chat let me see oh he sent us a message oh he's awesome guys awesome thank you so much that was that was super chat from uh from uh from kazi looks like yes sir have this like open at all times yes yes yes yes cool so we have i mean the slide clone is here so yeah we have that here cool so we have that on the right hand side let's go ahead and vs code on the on the right hand side so that's what the first thing to do so again right click integrate terminal npm start that's the first thing to do let's go okay awesome i will say yes you might not have this but i will say yes for now no problem and we have ourselves let's see let's see our first react application now we're going to move ourselves myself to the middle so we we can do it like this oh that's good that's good no in the middle yeah that one in the middle in the middle so now we have now we have the code over here yep yep we have sorry code over here slide clone over here beautiful exactly all right so app.js let's take a look at what do we have in terms of code well here's the thing guys your whole application is within where within right here within this portion right here you see this right here this is the whole slack application can you make this two thirds as well so it takes more space i really um i don't like that okay we'll see for now so for now i'll just make it then i'll change it up later so let's go ahead so i have header right here this means right here this means that the whole app the whole app is in the header guys you see this you see how we have edit and save to reload right here edit and save to your load that's where the app is it's inside app.js now you might be thinking okay how does that show up on the actual application well it's pretty simple if you go to index.js all you have to do look and see you see how react dom the render and this renders the app yeah pretty simple the way it works is they actually imports the app component the big app component and it imports it from there and then what it does is it actually puts it into the root element of the html where's that root element if you go to public if you go to any html guys you see right here this div id root that's where the whole react.js lives literally so gets all the code from this app.js and it puts it into this div right here so that's where the application is exactly exactly exactly sense pretty pretty simple guys okay so what we're going to do is we're going to remove this header for now let's go ahead and remove this we don't need this at all right now no not necessary okay and instead instead of here we actually have a different application we'll have the actual slack clone app in here so you see now it's all white no problem whatsoever okay cool now what are we going to do with this at this point well a few things in order for us to be able to to be able to kind of you know go from login to be able to go to a different page we're going to use or something called a router guys a router is kind of how you go from page to page let's say you go to about page then you go to example on facebook you go to your news feed or you go to your profile feed right it's routing through different pages you click on something and it goes to a different route okay correct that makes it so here's what we'll do in here in here okay in here i will go ahead and do a new terminal and i will npm install react router dom so we'll say npm install react dash router dash dom right there let's do that right now npm install and the right arrow down i'm going to show you react router i'll show it to you here just so you guys understand it if you see the web you can see right here this is the react router you see we can do switch and we can go different routes depending on what we want to do so we can show users or about depending on the route that we want oh so the route is the url path right exactly right change the url to slash about it's going to take me to the about react component exactly exactly exactly so let's go ahead and take a look at this so the first thing what i will do is check this out i will go ahead and go here and i will say i will say router router that's the first part and that rod is that's where where our routes will live now in order to use that we have to import that let's go ahead and remove this here for a second we don't need this let's use import router so i will say import now we'll say from browser router this is called browser router as router what does this mean what does that mean daniel that we are going to import uh a specific thing from the libraries called browser router and we're naming it router so that we can reference it in our code router yes correct exactly because i don't want to use browser router in here instead i'm going to call a router so this kit is just kind of renaming guys you're in a different name and can you explain why you have three different as is so check this out router route and as it says three different as is as is so yeah so i'm gonna hold on one second i'm gonna import this from react router dash dom boom react right there's down okay cool so that's all awesome that is all great now the reason why we have browser router router route and switch it's for one reason is because we're actually using all these three different ones right if you look at react router you see we have to use switch and route and so forth yeah makes sense yep that makes sense cool so let's go ahead and do this let's go ahead and do here inside here we'll have two routes one it's going to be for login another one is going to be for the chat okay gotcha so let's do this right now so i will say switch switch right here inside the switch we'll go ahead and say route right here like this route boom boom route okay and that's gonna be one route and this route we're gonna give it a path we'll say path is equal to what should the path be is this gonna be for the login or is this gonna be for the main page gonna be for let's say for the main page if it's gonna be the main page usually that's just a slash yes well it's gonna be for the room page so we'll do it here page so the room is going to be actually the room when you go to channel that's the page we want to use okay now inside that page we need to reference something like it's going to be some kind of a page right some sort of component exactly so let's say for example this is the chat page right chat page right here there's a chat page okay the next route is going to be what now this one's going to be the login exactly so say path equals and it's going to be dash so the home page is actually going to be the login page okay so whenever we can't go to the room we'll just straight you take you straight back to logging guys make sense that's pretty simple all right let's go ahead and add that up okay that's me one route and this is going to be the login page right there all right cool so let's go to save this if i say this this should technically now show it to me in our application look at this we have a login page right now because why we're in the roots right now you see based off the url exactly okay but if i go to room let's say oh let's go you see very simple right now you have a chat page and you have a login page just like that yo yo guys what is going on uh one of the things i wanted to mention because i am in the chat and i'm taking a look at what you guys are saying so i saw katrina say this and i saw a couple of people brian don't stress guys um if you are new to react and you're having trouble following along that is totally okay the whole point is to show you what's possible with react and later we can show you how to do it step by step remember the video is also going to be there so you can watch it anytime later at your own pace this is a lot to cover so just follow along have fun pay attention and you can code along later if things are not working right now okay so don't worry you're not alone we got you yeah exactly exactly guys don't worry you will be able to watch the video later on for now just kind of watch enjoy be part of the community and of course if you can follow okay awesome so we have these two pages now one really cool thing about what about react is that we use components remember how many components and we split the components up you know in slack long in this slack remember that yes so to create components it's a very simple process right we have the header component and so forth let's create the chat component and let's go ahead and create the which component the logging component yeah that's pretty much it so what we're going to do is on the left hand side guys you see on the left where it says source let's go ahead and create new folder and this under source let's create a folder and create a folder called components oh okay that's the components folder inside the components folder we'll do new file and we'll say chat chat.js boom right there that's the chat component guys okay to create our chat component it's as simple as typing in rfce now if you don't have this ability to rfc for example here's what you can do here's what you can do you can go to extensions you can go to and then you can you want to look for es7 react right here react code snippets and this right here and this extension allows you this right here to do code snippets like rfc and so forth to really quickly create those components make sense makes perfect sense comprende all right good so go ahead and install those if you want of course i highly recommend this so install this right if you have install button at that point that's pretty much it so let's go back to chat js and look at this guys here's some magic for you rfc enter boom right there oh let's go okay well good so i'm just keeping this smoothie running for a little bit so really i think it's really late yeah it's all good there we go so inside the chat we have our chat component and this is where we can say chat for example okay now the way we'll use the component if we go back to let's say app.js instead of now saying chat page we'll say like this we'll say import import chat from from where from our chat component component so we'll say dot slash dot slash meaning the current uh path the current directory components slash chat right there okay that's gonna get the chat all right so we'll say chat page and now instead of now doing the chat page we now replace this with uh the little less than greater than and we put a chat in that chat component check boom right there look at there see this is now guys the chat component think of it as a block right it's a block you took a block you're working on this block chat block and now you put the block as part of another block you see because the app is its own block yes makes sense so if we go to that chat dot js that's where all of the stuff about the chat inside of this div that we're calling chat that's where this is all gonna live exactly that makes sense to me pretty cool pretty cool awesome so we have chat that's pretty awesome next up let's go ahead and do this after chat let's go to app2gs let's quit the login now as well so we'll do this new file we'll say login.js oh right there let's do a new component on downloads with the rfce to create a new component there too rfc one right there you got that nice all right nice now if those people don't have the rfce can they just type this out noz yeah you can just type this out no problem so if you want you just type this out by yourself import react function login export default login so this is the basic code that you need to be able to create a component yes exactly perfect yes exactly we got those two components now now i can say login for example okay i go to app.js and set another login page where i'm gonna what am i going to replace this with this one could be the login component baby so but of course before we use it we have to import it so we'll say import login from where again it's going to be the path which is current directory components slash login because that is where we have their login.js there we go check this out now guys you ready for this are you ready for this yes sir look at this we'll say now login no not like this login boom boom boom okay okay save it and let's go let's go let's go oh we got the login beautiful nice nice nice so moving forward we have the login page okay no problem we have the chat page again if i go to rooms here room chat is right here now a few things need to modify before we move on the first thing you need to do what's up i just wanted to clarify something because i mean this looks the same as before but what's the real difference now than what we just had before nas the big difference is actually the fact that we're using now components before it was just a text and you were you were putting all your html into one file called app.js now you're splitting your functionality into multiple files one for chat one for login and what's really cool because think about it it's like if a car right in the car right you have a steering wheel that steering has its own function right if that steering wheel was like was also like in the car it was like the whole car was a steering wheel that would not make sense every single part has its own functionality it's a building block gotcha okay so we're kind of breaking it down to its core pieces of the website and then we're making those into its own different components exactly exactly okay i love it cool cool cool so let's go and do this so we have the login browser and we have the chat page now to make okay first first let's go up before mine let's go ahead and add that test.js i want to remove some files it's going to remove this so we'll delete after test.js we don't need that okay also for the at that css let's go ahead and do this i want to remove everything that's inside here so we'll do command a delete everything inside here we don't need that instead what i want to do is i'm going to do a margin like this i want to say margin margin zero right here margin zero cool so this right here margin zero guys stands for what this stands for every single element i want it to be margin zero because each one paragraph tags they all have margins we don't need those perfect okay okay so we got that that's deleted logos vg let's go and remove that too we don't need that specific that part two as well so i'll get svg see this portion as well move to trash cool all right we have pretty mild bare bones project app.js with that with that said a few things now we have to do inside our chat login page okay okay look at this so here's what we'll do i will go ahead inside the route i'm going to again to create this portion i'm going to create a container what's a container it's a container container is going to contain the dip it's going to contain everything it's going to be controlled the padding the margin inside the whole application okay okay look so here's what i'll do i will go ahead and inside the router i will say container boom right there now okay what is this now pretty weird right like what does it do i would say it's pretty weird would you say so i would say so yeah i'm trying to figure out what is this container so look i'm going to wrap this container inside this whole switch statement you see yeah inside this whole switch it makes sense yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so that's the whole container inside now that we're going to create a header remember how we create this header yeah this is the header remember this one yep let's create this header so we'll say here we'll say header boom that's me the header now it's not gonna work at all not going to work at all but that's okay because look at this if i save this and if i go ahead and go to react app boom i cannot define undefined why because these are actually divs and with these this what we're going to do is we're going to use styled components guys oh yeah that's the sick part style components in css we usually have css but in our case when you style components to create css look at this it's like basically javascript it's like css but on steroids and for those of you who don't know what css is it stands for cascade styling sheets i believe but it allows you to make the website look super pretty because right now we haven't had that we how to make it look purple how do we make it get wider how do we add all these css components and there's not as saying using style sheets you can do that on your react components yes so here's what we'll do let's go ahead and do this we'll say npm install styled dash components uh you guys don't see it hopefully you guys see at the bottom right there right there and then install style dash components you see at the bottom components right there all right install those beautiful by the way guys we currently have two 366 lines let's get to 400 come on i know you guys got this we believe in you guys you guys will take this to 400. yes come on all right so we got the style component so good now to import them we'll say import styled from styled dash components boom okay so save that beautiful stock opponent so we imported them now what we do is look at this i just want you to pay attention oh we got frank in the house let's go oh super chick oh man always good to see you ramos i love that guy amazing okay so look what we're going to do now is we're going to create our first div i'm going to say container here's some say const container is equal to styled dot div this right here creates a div for those who don't know what a device david is a container right kind of like a little block element right so that's what what that's going to do that's the container then we're going to do for the header for now for the header we're going to create a separate component for the header so let's do this i will go to components and i will say new file and i will say header.js okay good inside there i will say rfce okay again this makes my life just so much easier guys i highly recommend extension then inside here i'm gonna say the header boom header good so that's the header okay cool let's go back to the gs let's go import the header we'll say import header from where components from components i like i just like yeah music is good the music is good oh you know just kind of it makes you go into the groove you know coding you know yeah so components and we'll say what header okay good so we got that portion now now it says header is not defined why is that why is that well pretty simple it's probably because then load properly you got me i was like oh my god we messed up we up now now before we go any further nas can we quickly reiterate through all these different components and tags that we have here just to make sure we understand what everything is so i want to make sure you get this right yeah so let's get this okay so look at this we currently have a few things holy snaps can we get two thirds again hold on bro it's so much easier like this hold on gosh darn it so look we have this this right here is the container you see this blue box that's the container so if i go ahead and brought put the brush that's the container now again i want to make sure i'm on the same page the container is going to be used to be able to style everything inside of it yes okay that makes sense right you have to continue kind of like for example here you have a water bottle right this right here is a container correct the water bottle is a container not sponsored by liquor head yeah so we're not supposed yet so this is the container but now let me ask you this if i drop food coloring into this container the water inside is gonna change to that color correct if i drop grass or dirt there's gonna be dirt in this water so this container now controls everything that's inside of it correct so if we style this container it's gonna show on everything else inside of it correct so now exactly exactly makes sense so cool now what we have is inside of that we have something called a header that's gonna be our header and this is this component right here perfect that's component now you have the chat and currently we're in the room the room path this is why we're currently in the room path this is why we see the chat window right here makes sense that makes sense cool and this is the chat window it's pretty simple okay so next up we've got the header we've got that let's go ahead and now actually maybe customize the header a little bit i would say so let's customize the container let's customize the header for the container guys again we say you want to have a full width because we'll do it we'll say here we'll say width width 100 100 100 i will say height is going to be what what do you guys think would it just be the full height full height so we'll say 100 vhs now what this means vh guys stands for 100 vertical height of the whole browser window okay so we'll take up the whole vertical height for that container if i say background color here for example background and i say orange okay look at this boom back on orange oh let's go you see just like that this right away tell i know right this right away tells us that this right here is the container because it's the whole orange box makes sense comprende yep yep yes good we got that next up let's go and do this we're create we're going to create after that something called a what grid um what does agree to do so look at this this is the header okay underneath that because we have the sidebar right and the chat window we're gonna wrap that as well in its own little container oh cause those are two different columns correct remember yeah the sidebar here yep yep right and then you have the chat window here yeah we're going to wrap those in something called the main okay look at this here's what i'll do i will say here header and i will say now main boom i will copy this main right here copy this main all right command access now put it more again in the switch route main look at this okay all right main now this main so main is not defined don't worry about that we'll go ahead and create it right now so say const main is equal to styled styled that div well right there cool awesome so that's the main now you don't see the main right just yet but that's okay that's completely okay here's what we'll do guys remember how we had the head at the top the main is gonna be below it right what we can do to really make this cool because if i say background color here let's make the background of oh wrong one if i say background background of let's say for example blue okay back on blue now that's the main you see it's really small now exactly we want we want to take up the full height correct correct the full height now how do we do that well look at this if i go to here header main in the container remember how we said how the container controls everything yeah i would define the height of the header and define the height of the main oh cause those are inside the container exactly how cool is that this is guys this is why coding is so cool okay look at this i will say here in the container i will say display grid boom grid is going to define the height and all i have to say now at this point guys is something called grid template rows i will say here grid dash template dash rose and here i will say what this our my first row is go here's what i think i can say height here and i can say height here i need to define the height of my first row and the height of my second row okay you understand yep you understand so look at this my first height of the header which is going to be 38 pixels height that's part one okay that's the one that's the height of my header now the height of my main diff which as we said was what which is which one this div right this whole big shenanigan right here second row huh the second row i say auto guys auto oh you see so does auto just fill out the rest of the the rest of it that's what it does that makes sense so now we have the header and we have the mean which has that which has the sidebar and the chat would that make sense perfect makes sense perfect cool awesome so we got that portion that's all cool all right we got the portion now let's go ahead and go into our what and actually create a sidebar as well sure okay the sidebar let's do it let's do a sidebar look at this as since the recruit destruction now at this point we can just do that no problem all right let's go ahead and do that so the sidebar is going to be where now under the sidebar okay the sidebar is now going to be on the left this side we're going to be here correct and the main window is going to be here correct perfect cool so here's what we can do i can inside here i will say inside the main i will say sidebar i will create a component for the sidebar you see i like this so everything is made out of components everything's made out of components that's the cool part about this guys that's amazing all right all right so cyborg that's the component boom now of course you need to create the component first let's go ahead and go to components right here we'll do components and we'll say new file and we'll say sidebar sidebar.gs oh somebody gs okay amazing so that's still all good inside this let's create our own component rfce rfce yeah rfce yeah okay so sidebar that's our component now so we have a sidebar section here okay at the gs let's go ahead and import the sidebar so i will say here import sidebar from what our sidebar component path components and we'll say sidebar right here pretty simple you see pretty simple cool we have now that that's all good let me go ahead and see this we have a cyber component we have that component i love that okay next up is what now now you have a sidebar in the chat but you see how these two components are next to each other we don't want that no we don't so here's what we'll do instead we also use something called display grid guys also display grid display grid and see how the main the main is the container for the slide bar in the chat would you agree through that one yes i totally agree yes so we can also display grid to despite the width of this and the width of the chat oh see look at this so here's what i'll say i will say here display grid let's play grid and now here's one do i'm going to say now instead of doing rows i will do columns i will say grid template dash columns okay and inside here i will have now what the width of the first column and the width of the second column so very similar to the heights how we had them before yes our first column width is going to be what is going to be 260 pixels for now sounds good now what do you think is going to be the width of our second column though very similar to before i think we want the second column to take up the rest of the space yes so we simply say auto auto boom look at that now the sidebar is in the left hand side the chat is not so look i want you to show it to you if i go here and i will say for example sidebar let's go to sidebar and i will say here uh let's create a sidebar and i will say here style is equal to background let's go make that for example background so he's about to color the background so we could see the distinction of what the sidebar represents whoa right there this looks exactly like the sections look at that structure that we had before see how the structure we had before what is it where's the structure before right there right there that's our structure so we now guys have the architecture of the application and you always start out with the architecture always always okay always so now we have the architecture and looks how it looks it looks i mean it looks i know i know it looks stupid because but bunch of like red colors it's it's like a rainbow you know but i think it's cool because when you color like that you could see the architecture you could see the stream you could make sure you're on the same page so whenever you're modeling anything this is a great way to start always oh it's very visual exactly so now we have that well i'm going to going to remove this color because it looks hideous okay all right we got that sidebar chat that's so good and now let's go back to the js and now what we can do is we can focus only on the header now let's do it let's do that right now so let's go to the header let's go to the header and focus on the header so i'm going to go to the header right now out of the gs now the color of the header what are we adding oh let's go and remove this background as well i don't need this i color orange remove that okay cool now the header is there now in the header no not sidebar in the header it's pretty simple guys let's go ahead for the header root also create its own container because it has it is its own component you see that right there yep right so let's go ahead go header let me see okay good so i will say here instead of the div i will say container container container right there okay also container right here container comprende now containers are defined because why because it is a style component that we have not yet that created we need to import style components or import style style right here styled is equal to from style dash components good right there all awesome save that and then we could create that component right here so we'll say const container is equal to styled dot div like so now i want to ask a question because i'm not too familiar with style components yes can we name it something other than container or does it have to be named container that's actually a really good question that's actually a good question and no we can name it anything we want okay but container makes sense in this case yeah because it contains the header component right so it kind of like this is a bog like we call this a bottle right but they call it they could have probably called it something else i don't know a container water contraption i don't know you know but they call it a bottle right in our case contains water it encapsulates water it has a lot it has one yes a lot of people are like joe diaz is like in the house like comprende what's up joe diaz awesome so container is a style dip also i'm going to save that let's go and refresh this portion that's the header now what are we going to do with the header a few things well inside the header let's create a few different things inside the header we'll have two sections our first section is going to be which section it's going to be and i'm going to make this a little bit larger actually i'll make this a little bit smaller right there so our first section guys is pretty simple oh that's not what i want okay our first section guys is going to be oh fudge okay our first session guys is going to be this one this one so we'll have this section is going to contain the search bar it's going to contain this and this and our second's actually going to contain the username so we are also splitting this up into guys into two components makes sense our first component here second component here but they're all styled components so let's go and take a look at this okay if i go to here i'm going to call this one the main one so this one right here is going to be the main one so if i go to my react app i will say main main right here that's going to be my main style component and this is going to contain a few different things between the icons and so forth then the second one is going to be then i'm going to say user container user container oh look at this guys all right user container that's going to contain the user make sense if i go back to here again again this ah this right here goes for this stands for domain user container is going to be the user version right here comprende good all right for the user container let's go ahead and uncomment this out for now so command slash for two or control slash to comment out your code here okay that's pretty much it so now what this portion this portion let's do this in the main section we have two icons we need to go ahead and install the first icon is going to be we'll have an icon suction icon section and then we have icon here i can hear now how are we going to use those users like us tell me are we going to use some sort of library we can import cool icons we use something called material ui material ui icons look at this i've heard about this a couple times right there so my two ui icons this right here is allows you to use these amazing icons right here so for example if i want to use this icon i simply do access time click on it tells me how to use it oh that's the exact code that you need just to import it exactly that's it right but of course guys like like we cannot just use them we have to actually import create them install the module for it so once we install the module which is called material icons then we can use it so the first thing source we need to do is we need to go to our code and go back to our react app we need to go to our code and say npm install npm install and we'll say here um let me go back to material ui at material ui at material material dash ui before we install once we install the core material eye core right here okay install that boom right there that's gonna be the core that's the core material ui after you've got that we're going to install npm install and start material y by icons that's it perfect okay now two sections and now we have access to all of these amazing icons exactly images exactly so now late guys before you go move on guys let's go ahead and get us up to 500 likes we are currently at 453 you are amazing and we love you so much let's get us up to 500 likes i know you guys can oh okay beautiful all right so with this section right here okay how do we use now those icons well just how we copied it all i have to do is click on let's say we click on the access time i will copy this code right here copy this code i will then go to where i will then go to my app and then i will import it right here and i can simply use it like this like this access time like another component then like another component basically look at this and i close down like this boom done done that's it now it says here main is not defined why do you think that that's the case is because again we need to create a style component so we'll say const main is equal to styled dot div boom makes sense yep good that's the div awesome so look at this don't worry about the fact i may not define we just need to refresh it one more time so look at that now we have our own clock let's go all right what's the next what is the next icon we need to use huh it's that question question so let's do that one now so question mark let's see um question question this one help outline that looks good okay let's go and save this i like the song bro all right so we got that help outline icon beautiful we got that portion okay now again how do we use it guys we simply do help outline icon boom that's it comprende okay we got those are you ready bro i'm ready oh let's go we got two icons now now here's the thing we have the icons now let's create our what our search portion you see the search box let's create our search box so here's what we'll do inside here i'm going to create a search container i'll say search search container like so that's going to be my style component style component search container that's going to contain the whole input box okay then i will have the search box i will say search like this that could be another style component inside that i'm going to have an input box i will say input type is equal to text oh let's drop it people drop let's go let's go let's go oh oh let's go that's how we do but yeah let's go okay search so so search this is our input right here okay we have an input for placeholder search makes sense yes good all right search container search box all right now guys at this point at this point a few things you want to do now if i go back to here we're going to have an issue searching they're not defined and search is not defined as well so again we're going to create those specific parts so we'll say const search container is equal to styled dot dip both okay now now nothing here just yet that was a const search it is equal to styled styled dot div okay boom also now this now works but look at this you see how the search is here it looks hideous it's like it's like yeah yeah it's like what a sad sad ui so how do we do it nice that's a good i'll actually wait for that all right so the way we do that is pretty simple you see how the main kind of like you know the main wraps everything correct yes so what we do is we go to the main and we say display flex on the main look at this on the main i say display display flex now what is the place this place like you can spend for a second what does it look like is it going to order things inside of this div yes display flex allows us to order things layout like and nothing else it's such a powerful tool if you guys see it right here flags called flexbox flexbox right here guys right here see flexbox if you guys look at this right here this right here allows us to structure pretty much anything we want you know look at this horizontally vertically you want to flex wrap it wrap it you want to center it center it start and space around space between basically anything you want you got it so if you want to mess with your layouts you could go to flexbox and you'll see all the different things that you could do here exactly yes so now we've got this portion inside this flat spot let's go ahead what i will do a few things now this container contains also our what the user container the user container right here so let's go ahead and create the user container as well so i'm going to say user container as let's create a user container as well so i'm going to say user const user container is equal to styled dot dip makes sense okay cool now all right we got that inside the user container what are we going to have well a few things we're going to have the name right just like we have here the name and what and the image correct so let's do this let's go to our extrusion container and i will say here a few different things i will say name and the name will be what no sorry i'm just saying this like it's a long name i want to say tomoski coffee so then i will say and i will say for example now user image user image let's say okay cool that's going to contain the image comprende yes go ahead all right inside here let's create an image so say image source what is the source is equal to what source picture in there it's got a picture in here so i don't know how to copy this for you guys but maybe i don't know image source right here this is gonna be our image source right here now i can probably copy this i can probably send to daniel post then you could probably copy and paste it into a chat let me see i'll send to daniel right here where do you want me to copy paste it into uh into youtube window all right daniel there we go also can we uh zoom into the code boss oh you got it for sure bro maybe make it two thirds that won't change to zoom in but okay here how about that is that about it you want to zoom in like this you mean even bigger right here whoa whatever whatever the people make them happy there we go let's go okay awesome so we got that portion i think that's a bit big is that is that better for you guys i think that that was david saying that so i think he's okay it'll be good for now okay cool awesome so we got that let's go ahead and do this name is azari user image is there and of course we go direct direct tab nothing is there of course so what we need to do guys is create these components style components i will say here honst const i will say here what name name is eco2styled.dim boom okay next i'm going to create this const what const user image see user image image is equal to what equal to styled div boom right there done so that is done okay everybody that is done cool stuff not styled wait it's tied styled right here style now by the way what are these things that i'm seeing after the div because some people are asking oh these right here are called what are they called notations back ticks now these backtick guys are the reason where we put our csx css css okay this is where we put our css all right so that's it's called backticks guys if you don't know and backticks are very powerful actually allow us to do something called temple literals it's a very very powerful uh tool in coding javascript in general as well comprende comprende good all right awesome all right moving on moving on we have all these components they're all they're all great but here's the thing now if we go ahead and refresh this it looks shitty right it looks shitty bro right it looks good it looks nasty yeah it looks nasty okay again first is first let's go ahead and change this background color of of uh the white to be the color we want to be which is this orange color or this violet color right here okay so the first thing i'm going to do is i will get the background color let's go take this now put the where i'll put that in the container so container oh right there background color and guys copy this for yourself background pound sign three five zero d three six okay make sense good save that oh let's go look at that now it's all so much better okay we're going to set the color the color which is going to be the color of what the color white that's with the color of the icons but then right there okay now we get the icons that's all great that's cool now let's go ahead and structure it as well the icons are there but the czar is at the bottom so what do we do to make desire at the top or at the right hand side what do we do well didn't we do something called flex yeah let's go so since the container manages the main and the user container which are currently top to bottom what we say is we do display flex so let's say for example on the container we'll say just play flex let's play display flex let's go do you think we can hide the console real quick brother let's get more code thank you so much display flex we got that okay save that now now look at this now zary is here you see on the right hand side it went from vertical alignment to where to or horizontal alignment exactly okay now cool with that said with that said a few things okay we still want to fix this you see how this is a vertical alignment as well yep what can we do what do you think oh man i mean we've been using this specific thing called display flex so i'm assuming it's gonna be that again for the longest time let's go baby all right okay so user container as well since the user container is what contains the name and the user image i will on there i will say what display flex on this one boom oh let's go look how cool that looks now bro now i want you to watch it for a second okay here i'm gonna put this i'm gonna make this a little bit on the right hand side more right there like this look at this i want you to watch this as i'm typing this for a second okay look at this guys if i go ahead if i go ahead and display flex i will say in order to vertically align all of these you see how it's centered yeah they're all kind of like wonky right now where should you watch it right look at this guys if i go you see if i go to flexbox with my flexbox you see in order for us to change the vertical alignment we simply say align items right here so if i go to react app if i go to the container and i say align items what do i say now are you going to do the center center are you ready for this safe oh right on the job oh come on come on no it missed the oh man hold on never mind so what wait why didn't it work though align item center that's the vertical alignment let me see i need to go ahead can i try this oh i didn't refresh wait but you did it on this wait which no that's fine that's fine it's because the user container needs to be aligned uh uh vertically as well that makes sense yeah okay so if i do this look at this i do a line so on the user container i need to align the zari and this window as well i see align items center as well boom let's go hey let's go oh look at that that's beautiful now in order for us to now go ahead and space this portion around here's what we'll do i will say justify content space between on the container so i will say justify content defy content content and i will say space space between so space between is going to push after to the side okay but what what do you think it will push to the side um maybe all the components inside of this container well a few things we have two components one is this one one is this one it's going to spread these two components out because the container is this whole thing correct and then we have within that we have this and this can we show them on flexbox what the space between should be doing yeah if you go to flexbox right here let's see right there look at this guys you see this right here boom space between pushes items away from each other as far as possible it's like me see this is like me pushing daniel because i don't want it like i don't want to be near this guy you see what i mean i don't know why he's here i smell too much smells bad i smell bad so anyways that's whole the whole goal of this portion so if i just space between and i save this and then by the way could we change this to white real quick just because because too much it's a little too much yeah i think so too i agree let's go let's go to app.js i've done g yes background color blue how's that oh let's go badger beautiful okay thank you so now that's good stuff good stuff guys so we have that we have that space between now let's go ahead and add some padding and actually make this so much so much better than we actually should be so look at this now for the for this app a few things is going to happen we need to go ahead and one uh modify these icons let's go to header.js modify these icons right here the access time icon and the help outline icon to give it a little bit of width okay but you need to give it some width it makes sense okay but actually before that what i want to do is i want to go ahead and modify this input box i want to make this input box look just exactly like this oh yeah yeah because the white one looks nasty it looks just bad yeah yeah yeah so here's a little deal on the search container guys in the search container what we'll do let's go ahead a few things let's go to search container we'll give this one a min width for now manu width menu width of what 400 pixels right there 400 pixels that's the mini width okay so now you can see now it pushed everything to the side here correct but that's not the issue guys that's not the issue now what we do is we if we go to another search thing the search let's go now to search go to refresh this actually okay it's gonna go to search right here search can search search okay to modify the search a few things are going to happen number one is i'm going to go ahead and give this search a width of a hundred percent so let's say with oh 100 let's see oh no not not this one search with 100 oh cause that was a container that's the container so we'll have to give this one now the search inside of containers we're gonna make it spread all the way to get that width 100 and it's not doing it that's okay hold on let's see i'm seeing inspect element and spam input oh this adds because the input needs to be 100 sanji width of this one's gonna be 100 let's go see okay just like that cool so no worries no worries so now what we're going to do is on the search a few things i want to go ahead for the search container or for the search let's do the first few things we're going to add a box shadow to add a kind of border around it so we'll say box shadow a smurf small border around this let's see like so so make sure you click you can copy this if you want crush this so now he'll box this border you see this box shadow small yeah that's what we've got now okay now what i want to do is i want to give it a small radius kind of like a concave kind of like uh give it us you know a nice smooth edge smooth smooth out man you know yes you gotta smooth it out so let's move down by really simply just saying border radius radius radius is equal to what smooth smooth no it's actually just pixels so we'll say six pixels if only man if only only coding was that easy just like i know but look at this guys you see how it changed look at this if i if i actually make this bigger for you so you guys can see it look at it you see that right there oh that looks so good how good does that look bro beautiful looks so sexy sexy look sexy sexy okay good so now we have that portion inside this let's go ahead and do a few things i'm going to um let me see a line item center should i do like items no i don't do that i want to now focus on the input this input looks horrible yes i don't like that blue it's just it's everything so it's just horrible so within the search i'm going to say input like this this is how you guys uh do css within style components i can do input on the search so it's going to basically it's going to target input within the search search container so we look at the component right the input is where inside of that search oh that makes sense okay we create the style component and now we're targeting the input within a stock component now because the input is in html this would target any input exactly inside of this component exactly makes sense to me make sense cool cool all right so we got that now we say for the input i will say background color and i will say transparent because i don't want to have the hideous background color transparent parrot oh come on okay trent now let's put it on right there oh and look at that see now transparent look at this you see boom ah now it's clean right i will also say border because you see how the hideous border border is equal to what hey let's go nah let's go hey let's go that's beautiful i'm going to give it a little bit of a patty i'm going to say padding left padding left of what pending 1178 pixels and i'm going to say padding right also going to be eight pixels you see so now we're just making some padding you see here on here looks good right yeah now question are we going to make this guy disappear watch the blue yeah are we going to make this all the way to the end later yeah we will don't worry about it oh i got you bro i got you guys okay all right so look for the search one what's going to happen is pretty simple if i go to search i will say here number one i want to modify because when i type here she types in black text i want to type in just go say color because the color is equal to white oh save that oh say that oh ah let's go let's go let's go oh that's so sexy man that's good it's so good it looks funny with the smaller image i know i know man okay now a few things let's go ahead and modify the uh a few things on the input you see when i click the click this it has like the blue color bro yeah what's that called no it's just i don't know just piece of is what i'll say but what's it called though i agree with you but what's it called it's called the border but it's an outline actually it's an omelet on the focus of the element okay it's gonna outline yes exactly amazing that's exactly what it is so i will say here to remove that i will say input focus so on the focus of the input because it happens only when you focus on it you see that i will say outline none so now when i do this oh let's go outline look at this that is amazing now a few more things i want to do first thing i want to add a small padding tool so i'm gonna say you see how it's just very close to the first i wanna just wanna give it some more space you know give it space yeah space guys space in coding and user interfaces user experience really really important whenever you're developing any application giving a space giving a white space as always don't be as if it's not if it's clustered this is not good you know it's not enjoyable to see so what we'll do is we'll do what petting top padding dash top and what we'll give planet bro four pixels four pixels and panning bottom we'll give a what uh four four pixels as well let's go okay and look at that you see now it's there now it's more readable now it's not all compact exactly but it's still hideous it's still hideous why i don't know i asked you why no i'm not asking you bro why do you [Laughter] i don't know man you tell me what do we need to make better the search is actually not centered um or is it do we want in the center i don't know okay or vertically centered vertically yes oh i see what you're saying i think i've been horizontal so what i'm going to do is i'm going to say here i'm going to say uh i'm going to say i'm going to say align because the search is actually going to be flexible i'm saying display flex flex okay and i'm going to say align items center watch it watch it nothing changed because it actually is centered so it wasn't as likely as we thought so wasn't that's just my fault it's all good it's cool if you just add that extra yeah yeah yeah yeah cool so look now we have these icons this icon no problem now let's focus on these icons right here okay from printing nice good so and here a few things is going to happen well we have what we have the user container there we have a name and a user image now user container okay if we scroll down what happens well we have a display flex and align items center for the user container a few things i want to do is i want to give it some padding right of 16 pixels why because i want to have this image to a little bit more like a way for me you know what i mean so i'm going to say penny right padding right right and again guys for for those who don't know what is padding what is margin explain to them well a padding is the amount of space that will be given within an element while margin is the amount of space they'll be given outside of an element yes correct just kind of how you think about this if i go ahead have a right rectangle here okay guys if i have rectangle good poof okay this is my diff it's div yes your padding is space from inside see okay that's your padding so kind of how we had here we had this div you see and i said petting right 16 pixels so i'm giving a space from inside i'm pushing it from the right hand side you see that right there that's a perfect explanation right there see yep yep and then margin margin is actually pretty cool margin is basically margin is space from the outside so here's what i'll do i'll say outside outside outside outside yep that's margin right that's pushing things from the outside not from the inside makes sense makes sense makes sense everybody in a chat yes or no i think so all right guys we are currently 516 likes can we get to 600 likes bro bump it up i know let's go let's get to 600 likes oh guys 600 likes 516 let's get to 600 i know you guys got this no problem whatsoever guys come on so we've been coding out for quite a while now it has been insane insane it's been fun we are well we're not done oh we got we made some pretty good progress amazing progress and now we're just waiting for you guys to get to 550 likes 550 guys come on help us out with youtube algorithm you guys you guys got this let's go one two three four five six seven hey let's go five fifty hulk left right come on go right okay and then it's four counts and then you go i do my own thing all right let's crush this header because we're almost there almost dead bro cool all right so at this point at this point we have our name we have our user image guys okay inside our name let's go ahead and give that name some pending as well guys okay so for the name we'll do padding right 16 pixels here as well heading right penny right 16 pixels okay see over there it just right away ready to move you see that right there it moved to the right hand side you see that yeah okay so guys yes exactly smash that like button guys let's go kill it let's go 550 likes you guys are amazing as always as always thank you so much okay cool so we got that now this image now what do you do with that oh man i don't know but it's overflowing i don't like it i mean it's like it's yeah it's it's horrible horrible so here's what we'll do we're going to set the user image div the container you see we have a container right here let me go ahead and remove this force mode off image you have the container here and the image is actually inside the container okay i'm going to set the width and the height on the container first okay you see so here's what i'll do i'll say the user image is the container i'm going to say width for this one what and i'm going to say what 28 pixels and i'm going to say height is what is it also 28 28 pesos it's a box exactly now if i save this nothing's really going to happen why is that why because i have a spelled height what do you mean you misspelled height oh i did actually spilling it hides when you're picking oh oh my god it's horrible that looks horrible what'd you do i'm sorry guys yeah it looks horrible that's okay though none of the issues okay so look at this it's because here you see this div bro yeah see this div this right here is the user image the image is overflowing um it's 48 pixels the div is 28 pixels gotcha so in order to change the image to be able to to fit the div i simply say image 100 so i simply go this i say please say image and i say width look at this width 100 and i'm ready dude that one was on the drop i know that was the whole goal hey you see you see right there just like that guys it's so simple it's so simple right right there so we got that let's go and now do a few different things let's get a small border for the image i'm gonna say uh border here order two pixel solid solid just give it a small and i'm gonna give white okay okay now this border is there now again it looks still pretty bad that's fine and what i will do with that i will go ahead and say border radius for the radius radius that i use and i will give it border radius of what three pixels save done look at that now it's a border race of three pixels how sick is that huh that's amazing that looks clean it looks clean as heck so is the header done are we getting there oh almost there almost we're getting almost there we're getting there so hold on almost there here's what we're gonna do now what i'm gonna do is pretty simple i will go ahead for the search container you see how there's space in here and here yeah i wanna add that too okay okay ready so here's what i'll do i will add spacing here and here so for the for the search container right here i'm going to give a spacing of 16 pixels so here's what i'll do search container i'm gonna say margin remember how we said the outward one is which one margin margin so i'll say margin margin left is going to be 16 pixels and i'm going to say margin right is going to be 16 pixels as well so now if i see this guy check this out oh let's go you see that we're not done yet oh what else do we got look at this because now we can also now give some spacing for this portion right here you see how this is very close and this is this this like if i if i make this smaller it's going to be another close about let's see right there talk to the mic bro okay sorry so you see how this this right here is so close to the end of the page and i don't like that so here's what i'll do i will go ahead and look at my current main section you see that right there yeah and i will give it some padding as well or margin actually i'll give it a margin of 16 pixels left and 16 pixels right okay here we'll do let's go main where's our main here here right no no not here main i will say margin right right 16 pixels that's not going to change much honestly the margin left of what 16 pixels as well oh you see it's so much cleaner very clean so much cleaner but we're not done yet what else do we do so look so look guys not done yet we're pretty much done but here's the cool part here's where i want to teach you guys something really cool you see how this right here is kind of not centered it's on the left hand side what if i wanted to center these this component but have this component still be on the righthand side i want to center this fully to be here yeah i have this here um is there like some sort of a line thing like that a line but it's actually better look at this if i say you see look where is our parent component our parent component is what the container correct yes if on the container i say justify content instead of space between let's say i say center see now they're all centered i don't like that so here's what i'll do i'll take this component out of context okay so what i mean by that when i say take something out of context i mean take it take this and make it a ticket outside its own layout so it will actually have its own layout that's really cool you guys ready for this check this out just look at this it's so cool that it like i'm like holy it's so good look at this i go to here nazari and this is the user container on the user container i say something called position absolute okay now and here i say right of zero and on the container i say position relative look at this position relative relative okay user container is not gonna be positioned absolute right zero and look at this now if i say this you write for this i think it already happened oh happened oh what happened look at this you see oh all right look at this guys now it's centered you see but this is always in the right hand section what happened is that we made this absolute to the container so absolute means it's like hey stick stick this for example let's say this is my phone right absolute let's say this right here right there absolute is like this right here or here it's a certain corner and it will always be there no matter what it's like placing pixels in certain situations like placing dots and where you wanna want it to go that's what absolute positioning means comprende make comprehending good all right so cool so we got that portion and look at that this is now centered this is the right hand side ah so good and we are now done with the header let's go if you're still with us if you're still pumped let us know in the comments below give us some fire give us some rockets guys we're going to move on to the sidebar which is almost basically our last section right yeah it's our last section guys so guys we love you all so much it has been amazing we are currently at 562 likes let's get to 600 and let's move on the sidebar section right let's do that right now all right cool guys so let's go 600 likes right now all right cool we've got the header it looks just just epic man type some stuff type some stuff it just types beautiful it just types it's so beautiful never mind i can't say that everybody's like i'm pumped i'm palm let's go gianna is pumped yes yes yes yes 572 likes by the way that's amazing so cool all right guys now at this point let's create the sidebar section are you ready for this let's do it man can i get on you oh yeah [Laughter] finally bro you said it i forgot i was gonna do that hi y'all all right you gotta have fun with this guys when you go live you gotta you gotta have fun all right so a few things all right sidebar now let's look at our sidebar section we've gotta see this is the cool part about components guys is that we have worked on the header we can now leave it alone fully we can fully now leave it alone no problem whatsoever so now go to cyber.js and this is where we now work on just the sidebar section of our component you see right there that's it so let's go work on the sidebar section sidebar is also going to have a container so it's going to make this a little bit less loud people can hear it okay let's create this container so we'll say container 47 lines let's get to 600 come on so here we'll say container like this container beautiful nice thank you cool that was a container here boom right there again let's import style components import styled tiled from where styled dash components okay now to create a stock component what you do guys as you guys know this point will say const container is equal to styled i will say style.div right there solid dip okay okay so let's go ahead before i go on let's go and get some water actually before i do that get some water water break if you're also tired of talking don't forget to hydrate water's good guys oh so good i'm out of water you got the water yeah water right there never mind we got more water thank you thank you for the water appreciate thank you frankie shout out to frankie let's go goes in for frankie we'd be dying of thirst right now oh man so much you have no idea 582 likes let's go 590 and 600 coming for this one for you all right let's style this let's go i was going to say gentlemen let's style this sidebar let's go let's go i gotcha all right for the sidebar a few things are going to happen well uh in the sidebar uh of course as you know we have our sidebar looks pretty good let's give it this color you see this but this color right here that's going to be our our our um sidebar so let's give the first a color so i'm going to go to the the side container i'm going to say color right here background i'm gonna give it this background background right there back on three f f three f zero e for zero that's the color of that violet color so oh if i go here boom right there this is the color that's all we need now let me close this out next up you see how this right here in the header we actually added this edit is something called a box shadow but that does not you see this back shutter right here no not this one we added a box shadow for the header which does not show up for some reason and the reason why is because we need to add a z index for this one so we'll say z index see index 10 10 okay the box does not show up because we don't have a box shadow for the header let me see where's the box shadow church oh there it is so link let me get that box guys just kind of copy and paste this box for you guys right here this is just adds a really nice line underneath this you will see what i'm talking about here in a second oh you see it's nice very beautiful right nice and the reason why we did the index 10 here guys is because if without this the boxer was underneath the other component you see if i save this you don't you won't really see it oh actually you will never mind so i guess i'm wrong ah i guess you'll see it okay never mind comprende i guess those that works no no problem still so we still have the sidebar though that looks good let's go ahead and give the sidebar uh nothing pretty much let's go ahead and create the components for the sidebar well let's think about what components we need to create well a few things we have this workspace component that's part one okay then we're going to create the threads like these main channels and then we're going to create our own channels make sense make sense so let's create those three components right now actually yeah so do that right now so the first one is going to be the workspace container so here we'll say work work space uh work space container that's the one okay inside that container what do we have guys well we have the name and we have an icon to add it yeah correct so let's do that right now i will say here i will say name and inside the name is gonna be clever programmer that's gonna be the workspace okay guys and then underneath that we'll go ahead and create the new message button that's the new message okay oh okay so we'll say new message new message message boom right there new message and then add new message now that's going to create the the plus icon okay not so good i forget the plus icon right pretty simple so if i go ahead and refresh our app it does not work which is good because we need to create a style components i will say hi const const and i will say simply let's go ahead and do workspace container workspace space container is equal to what guys what is it called style that dip correct boom okay that's saved all good next one is going to be the name also not defined so we'll say right there const name is equal to styled dot dip okay okay all good all good nice next new message const new message is equal to styled dot div right there all right cool look at this we have a programmer right all good now check this out let's go ahead and make this specific portion let's make that white so we'll say color white to make the text white oh look at that that is beautiful as as always and then what i'm going to do is a few things for the royal space container i'm going to give it a height i'm going to say hold on yeah i'm going to give the height because i want to see this at the same time okay so first of all i'm going to work specifically i'm going to say height height of what height of 60 ah come on height of 64 pixels boom right there that's the height okay compressing good that's right next up what do we have after the height we have gonna refresh this nothing so with the high what's going to happen is we need to center that you see if i right click inspect demo than this one if i go ahead and look at clear you see this still did right here color white height 64 pixels the height is there because it's highlighting it but clever programmer the text is not centered so what do we do we center it let's go let's do it let's do it so to center it we do display flex okay and just like before what do we use to center it vertically a line a line a line items center oh let's go look at that's beautiful man it's so good guys so good all right let's add some space into the left hand side right here let's add some space into the clutter process we'll say workspace container will say padding left is going to be 19 pixels oh look at that and now let's shift it i see 19 pixels next up for the what for the name icon it's pretty simple well that's the style div now the new message icon let's do that one the new message icon this new master icon will actually contain what the new message icon will contain button eye contact give you the ability to add new messages so let's find one if i go ahead i want to add a new icon let's go ahead and find one let's say new see there's a circle see the circle here the plus circle let's use that let's use that because that signifies you're going to add something you're going to create something new so we'll go ahead and command c this one we'll go back to our react application we'll import our icon boom like here save that icon no problem and now we will do what add add circle outline i'll con icon i know oh let's go now don't worry about this guys we got you now you see how the plus icon is there and it's kind of there correct it's near the clutter programmer sign no problem whatsoever what we're going to do is we're going to do justify content space between to spread them out yes make sense as well do on this one i will say what i will say justify content dash content right space between save that oh let's go and now that's pretty much it now let's add a small border here we'll say border dash bottom and we're going to solid and we'll say actually one pixel solid can you turn on the music oh yes yeah and we'll give it a color of this look at this guys whoa that's the color we'll give it so if i say this oh you see now we have a small border right here that looks pretty cool it's a small border right now it's kind of signifies it more on the on the side of of slack make sense cool good all right cool so now we have that that's all good now for this plus cycling you see how it's like on the right hand side and we wanted to be more kind of like where was it spaced out more space about we'll figure it out here in a second we'll figure that in in a second so now how do we get this white box right here this white circle um will this include maybe creating another styled component well we actually we actually created one it's called a new message i was right ahead of you bro hey you're ready bro this style this style component contains the circle icon yes i will go ahead and do the following in the new message i will say width width of what of 36 pixels 36 pixels and a height of 36 pixels like that like so you see nice so many of you guys are telling me exactly what you said to type that's amazing you guys are epic 600 likes let's go all right all right beautiful beautiful 600 like that's amazing guys amazing thank you thank you so much yeah cool so we're going to giving you this new message right here see how how it has a height of 36 pixels and a width 360 pixels you see that right there now check this out i will go ahead and say background color white to exactly show you what i mean background and we'll say white oh i know don't worry about it got you bro i got you all right so look in order to change the color of the actual icon i will give it a color and it feel like this boom i saved that oh you see that that's good that changed the color of the icon yeah makes sense good next next up from that let's align and center it horizontally and vertically yes what do you do because it's just off in the corner right now exactly what do we do align items a look good align items but before we do that what do we need to do uh do we need to add any padding remarks no oh man no what do we need to do you tell me um i am out of options bro oh you got this display flex is what we do oh my gosh yeah again i know i will say justify content justify content and we'll say center center and then it will say what a line items oh i'm trying to hit the beat ah no it did not work out so close by two seconds but look you see it centered the whole thing vertically and horizontally the same time perfect now how do we make this portion give it just a little bit more you know i don't know maybe add some margin to this no some nice curves oh some curves yeah that's a nice curve we use that smooth feature let's add a smooth feature so we'll say bordering is smooth no we'll say border radius 50 we'll say border radius radius radius now the reason why it's 50 percent guys is is is for one reason because it's 50 of the whole width of the div right yeah so when you take the whole definition of the whole width of the div right that means it's going to like concave so when it's going to concave fully creating concave fully making it a very nice circle right but that will not have to do much much work at all then at that point what's going to happen is we'll give it a uh what's it called we'll give it a margin right margin right 20 pixels like that good good good hey let's go and then in order to make it an actual button i will say this i will say cursor cursor cursor pointer there we go save that amazing and now if i go and hover over this look at this it becomes oh oh look at that guys so look at what we've just done we have ourselves the header look at this we have ourselves this workspace what is left tell me just the different channels the main channels channels our own channels exactly now for the channel section we're going to do something differently guys we're not going to create these channels all separately like this we're going to be all the react.js smart about it what are we going to do ah so now we're going to see the power of components yes one of these is going to be a component and we can just replicate all these components so in order to replicate that we need to have some kind of a data source that's going to contain that data make sense so here what's up so for now where's this data source gonna be and then where's it gonna be later exactly now before i do that go ahead get some water i don't have water but i'm be joining nas all right beautiful so a few things guys alright for this section all right for this section we're going to save this data somewhere and necessarily we're going to save this data in in a database not database but like kind of we're going to create a json a javascript file so as we'll do inside source let's create a data section we'll create inside source right here let's do new folder or nonnew file let's do a new folder and called data see inside this data we're going to create something called sidebar data so new file sidebar data dot gs and tell them what we're going to do in here we're going to add in that json object yes we're going to create a javascript object that's going to go ahead and contain all the icons and the text for the icons comprende now guys this is only going to be temporary while in part two and part three we're gonna be actually having a database using firebase yes correct correct so if you're wondering we're gonna get to that but today we're gonna keep it static and we're gonna keep it all inside of the project yes so here's what we're gonna do guys i'm going to go ahead and create a project here i will say export i'm going to export an object or an array of objects okay i'll say export const and i will say side bar items okay and this is equal to an array see this array and one inside the array what do we have we have an object and every single object has two attributes it's kind of like an object kind of like attributes kind of like things of what a phone has an attribute of a phone might be things like for example you know the capacity right of the phone right or the look of the phone right no the amount of cameras it has same attributes here in our case the attributes one entry is going to be icon and another one is going to be what text in the text let's say the first one we're going to do is thread so we'll say thread here right now the icon for thread is what uh should we go to the ui materials what's called material ui uhhuh so we'll say here and i will say message i'll say message whoa we got lots of options so we'll use the message icon we'll use this one right here okay right here perfect it's a message i will copy this and i'll paste it into here just like so make sense yes good compared and now i can use the icon i can use i can use the icon like so i can simply do message look at this boom boom you see i have set the message icon as part of the value for the icon attribute comprende yes cool comma now i'm going to do i'm going to copy and paste this everywhere else we'll say copy and like comma paste comma paste comma paste comma paste all good all good all good so now we just have to change the text and these icons yes let's go and do this if we go to our thread we say all dms will say all dms dms okay then we'll say what mentions and reactions right correct so say mentions who let's go mentions and what and reactions reactions okay so then we'll have what save items okay then aside they will have more well that's it makes sense okay now inside here what icon should we use for the old dm's what is this called uh things called inbox inbox yeah you go inbox icon right there that makes sense inbox makes sense okay so we'll use the icon right here boom and now instead of the message icon we'll use the inbox icon like so all we're doing here guys is we're just collecting data or just having an array to be able to save this to be able to loop through it and display the necessary channels that we want make sense make sense hey let's go so we have the inbox icon that's amazing next icon is going to be the let's see dimensions icon that was an interesting one that's going to be the drafts icon so if i go to here and if i say drafts drafts right there that's the jeff second i will go ahead and copy this import it boom and we'll say what drafts icon just icon draft icon all right that's the draft cycle next up next one is going to be which one this is going to be the save items one so save items so here so save items that's going to be which icon this can be this bookmark i think it's called bookmark bookmark yeah it looks like a bookmark yeah it's a bookmark pokemon see it's a bookmark so bookmark book mark right there so i think we'll say the bookmark border one say bookmark border right here command c let's go back to here bookmark one left after this nice ah no that's not what i want we'll have a bookmark on here um guys beautiful there we go pokemon icon so now instead of this one we'll say just simply bookmark border icon nice beautiful okay just gonna copy and paste this next one is gonna be the watch one the people icon let's see people icon so let's go to people people people all right so now we have people icon right here i will go ahead and copy this one beautiful a people icon same thing here now people icon hey let's go awesome so that's gold good that's amazing that save items then we have peoples and groups oops peoples and groups and then finally last one's gonna be which one the more let's go more more so more whoo okay awesome that's more okay and now we got that section how do we add more which chocolate should we use for more icon it's like an app icon i'll say so yes app icon so say app look at the apps copy this one okay done apps icon and then inside here we say what apps icon now we've got the data we got the data got the data and we got what we need so let's create some components with this data let's do it so we go to the component we go to our stuff right here all right we've got the data no problem let's go to cyber.gs okay let's create our first let's create our first what our first channel section so i'm going to say something like this i'm going to say credit component called main channels guys are you guys ready for this main channels okay main channels boom save that that is all good inside the main channels now what's going to happen is we're going to create our main channel item icon so here's what we'll do i will say main channel item oh no inside here a few things are going to happen number one is gonna be the icon then i'm gonna be the text so for example let's just let's just have an example i'm gonna use this icon right here just an example okay and then i will use after that i will go ahead and say uh add this is just an example okay so main channels main channel item so main channels it's created style.div so inside here i'm going to say const main channels is equal to what daniel style.div oh let's go okay that's all good the main channels now are going to have a few different scenarios here well few things is going to be one part it's going to be uh display well you don't need to now forget this playfx for now let's now create the main channel item right here so i'm going to copy this one and i'll say const const okay is equal to styled.div boom right there you see that right there yes sir now look see now it's here now looks pretty bad won't you say so yes we can make it better it can be so much better so inside the main channel let's go ahead and make that so we'll say here's we'll do we'll save this mini channel we'll say number one here's the color of this here's the color copy this color it's a good color that's the color of the text and that's the color of the icon itself you see that how it's a little i think it's really cool grayish color yeah almost like ccc um almost like but it's not cc yet we were arguing about that for the past for 30 minutes we decided to go with nazi's color yeah yeah it's just so much better all right all right display grid okay display grid okay we're going to use display grid in order to set kind of have this plus size can be on the left hand side and have the odd ad be right here it makes sense make sense so cool so we'll say display grid and we'll say like this we'll say grid template we'll say columns for two columns because again right there are two columns here right one column is this another column is that yes make sense yes good two columns okay and inside here we'll say the first one is going to be 15 percent and the second one has to be what well as before if we wanted to fill out the rest of the space there's a keyword called auto i believe some buffering here looks like this on buffering but it's okay auto okay grid template column let me know let me make sure if it's all good still on youtube by the way uh okay grid template columns 50 auto okay cool next up we're going to do is we're going to give it a height so every single item is going to have a height let me say height of what height of of 28 pixels good to give the height nice guys nice nice nice next up after that we have what align item center you see how we currently are like here you see it's not good no but no um so let's let's align item center so let's go ahead and do align items align items center to line at the center oh that's all beautiful next up we'll do padding left to give it a little padding so we'll say padding left left of 19 pixels okay next that's that's the plus icon right here you see that and then what are we going to do and that's pretty much it at that point now we just say cursor cursor pointer and now we have what and now look at that hey let's go so now we have our icon section but hold on we're not done yet could you double check your mic just to make sure everything is good yeah it looks like yeah all is good why okay all right everything's all good two voices it's okay though but it's noticeable okay maybe there's a little bit of an echo somewhere it might be maybe from your mic as well we'll see all right i'll uh i'll i'll get away from you okay byebye i'll do the margin margins right the space between them margin right on this guy all right i'll just point it this way hopefully that figures out here hopefully okay cool so guys so we got that specific section all good no problem that's on the cursor pointer after that what's going to happen is now we're pretty much got done guys we're pretty much now done we are so close only a few things left look we have this first one right here okay we have this first one right here now all we have to do is need to how to is we need to import the data we use from the last one and loop through it so how do we do that well here's what we're going to do we're going to import like this i'm going to say import look at this import sidebar items data from data sidebar data why because if i go ahead okay if i look in my section right i'm curling the sidebar section okay here i'm currently here i need to do i need to get out of that folder i need to go to components right and you go to source that's what this dot slash means then i need to go back to data which is here and then go to cyber data gs and that my friends is how i go ahead and access this portion and i simply import this specific section make sure nice that makes sense cool so now we have that but here's what we can do you see how we have this one specific main channel check this out i will say this or you can use something called jsx i mean this is all jsx just so you know but i'm gonna do sidebar dot map that map is going to loop through every oh my god oh my god drink more water please okay it's going to loop through every single item so that map then what's going to happen and i'm going to say like this item pompom okay and inside here now i will do the following i'm going to actually create the html for it check this out inside this one i'm not going to say you see how i had this specific portion it's going to copy this one and paste it where it pasted into here boom all we did is i simply copied and pasted that specific section the main channel item and the circle portions make sense look at that make sense to me man okay now because we're looking through every single item we are getting the icon and the text for every item inside here as you're looping through every item is going to have the icon and text yes okay so here's what we'll do we're going to replace this icon with simply just simply item that what what icons oh and replace this one with what items dot text that text because each item has an icon exactly so now guys check this out if i now save this if i now save this what's going to happen if i say this right now you ready for this are you ready are you ready are you ready 634 likes guys let's get to 700. love you all so much you ready for this look what happened bro all right now there's no more buildups that's disappointing let's fix this oh it's fine it's okay look so site import error sidebar items data is not exported from data sidebar data it's okay we'll fix it export but it is export that's interesting part it is exported here that doesn't make sense so we have that let me see if i go to sidebar data export const that's the thing is it is exported um let me see start with the gs import error and export it from guys as developers this always happens you're gonna have to figure out you know there's a semicolon somewhere where it shouldn't be there's just something weird and wonk in the code what nas is doing right now is at high technical proficiency he's looking for this bug this bug that is living somewhere inside of his code that's telling it i think i know why actually i think i misspelled sidebar items data ah sometimes oh let's go simple misspell and look at this now let's go and now we have ourselves all the items you see we had one now we have all of them because we loop through them they loop through them and that's all we did nice look at that that's sick so we got that portion let's go to make the main channels for the main channel let's go let's do a petting top padding top guys we're almost done heading top of 20 pixels 20 pixels okay just get a little more space by the way shout out to everyone on the youtube comments telling us that we were mis we missed the data word did they actually say that they're all saying it dude really holy these guys are good thank you guys these guys are way too good okay i love it i love it cool so we got that section next up let's go ahead and do the following we've got the sidebar data that's all good sidebar all right now create the channels we're so close so close so close all right to create the channels we'll create a channels container so let's do this right now main channels and i was gonna do this channels container okay challenge container inside the new channels every single channel will have its own new thing so we have here here we'll do this we'll have a new channel container which is which will contain the plus section which is the plus icon right here so we'll say new channel container we're almost done so close bro so close new channel container and that's going to create when i have two things one it's going to have a div a div like so that's going to have channels okay and the second part is gonna be the add icon the add icon so it's gonna be like this but we're going to import that icon so let's go and go back to our our our thing with your ui we'll say add right there add icon import that icon command c export it here function bom right there use it and now we're going to use it right here let's come back here so we'll say here a and we'll say add add icon save that okay let's go ahead and save that let's go back to our what let's go back to our application and of course it does not work that's the whole goal of it and icon by the way should not be here it should actually be here guys thank you okay so let's create those two divs let's create a do we'll do const const st uh channels container so say const channels container guys is equal to styled dot div okay that's what then after that we're going to do what const new channel container channel container is equal to what styled that div like so okay so now that's all working look at this ah don't worry don't worry about that we'll just refresh this there we go we have the channels we have the plus icon it's all there guys we're almost here let's go ahead and do this in order to convert these channels to be what horizontally horizontally what what do we do i think we said a couple times so we'll do what we'll say display flex lex let's play flags and now this becomes what oh let's go let's add the same color not cc let's add this color right here to the color of this so how in the channel cleaner will say color oh let's say color like this boom color oh oh it looks so good beautiful beautiful as always all right nice nice nice nice nice and then we'll go ahead and do the following i'll go ahead and look at this for the channels container i'm going to also add a margin top margin desktop of 10 pixels okay save that that's gonna push a little more at the bottom then what do we do in order to spread these this right here away what do we do a space between so i will say this i will say justify oh i will say justify content justify content space between oh let's go i'm going to now vertical line how do i do that guys with the align aligned items i know there's so much css going on it's crazy then we're going to go ahead and do what i'm going to give it a height as well i'm going to say height of 28 pixels just so that it has its own little height thingy okay 20 pixels beautiful and then i'm going to give it a penny left or 19 pixels but so kind of because i wanted to align you see i want to align together with everything here you see that yep i want to align so i will say here padding dash left is equal to what boom save that oh let's go beautiful nice that that that is amazing okay cool so up next here's what's going to happen up next what do we want to go ahead and do is the following is any left let's go edit padding right for that plus icon so pending right right and we'll give that one to 12 pixels and that's pretty much it we've got the channels now let's create the individual channel bro let's do that all right now for the individual channel it's going to be called we're going to create a new container called channels list channels list right here boom channels list okay all right somebody said i smashed two i smashed the like button so many times at this point it's insane wow thank you thank you i mean appreciate you guys hopefully you could smash it more yeah likes before the end of this one can we get to 700 likes bro i don't know man before the end of this live call we're almost there when we finish this we better be at 700 likes guys come on like this video 700 likes nas is about to finish this by the time he does let's get 700 guys let's get it let's get it let's get it cool so we get the channels list in the channel it does come with a container for individual channels so here i will say for example individual channel is going to be like this some say channel channel now what i want you to pay attention to what do you see in terms of these components like main channel item and channel which i'm going to reuse it here again what do you see here they have some sort of data that we're giving them yes but what else i mean what else do you want me to see bro what what do you see and how these components are being used oh they're being reused yes you see these style components guys right here channel right right channel channel right it's the same component same name same component it's like you're taking the exact same iphone right but duplicating it one more time you see what i mean duplicating it so same thing here if i go for example to the main channel item right where you we're using the same component and we're looping through every single item and just adding the same component to after that item oh here oh sorry yeah right here right there see guys that's what i'm trying to say that's the whole goal with with mink with components channel channel same component reuse the exact same time makes it easier for you makes it easier for me as a developer makes it easier for the whole wide world same thing same thing okay awesome so now two channels now of course let's go ahead and create those two channels if i get a channel let's create a style.div so i'm gonna say neutral container and i will say const what is it channels channels list is equal to style.div okay okay and i will say channel of the financial as well some say const channel is equal to what let's go okay we got that now it still looks hideous that's okay on the channels actually guys we're almost done guys 700 likes guys so so close till the end here's what we'll do individual channel is going to have a height right a height of what 28 pixels then then we're going to say for example this we're going to vertically align them let's do that we'll say display flex flex okay then we'll say align item center to vertically align with this say align items center okay then we'll say what padding left to move it from the left hand side what how do we say this guys what do we do here you move it from the right lefthand side margin or padding oh we can do margin two actually it doesn't matter okay marginleft actually okay let's do margin here i'll show you why margin is not good here but let's do margin for now i'll show you a second while mod is not good here you can color the background makes sense make sense all right margin left no no no no i want to show to them margin left 19 pixels 19 pixels boom okay okay so look it pushed it 90 pixels no problem correct all right awesome so now look this is sick this is all good display flex no problem whatsoever right let's go do do cursor pointing to make sure that we can click on it pointer okay so if i hover over this now it's a cursor now one really cool thing we can add is when you hover over it it will actually change color so here's how we can do this guys if i hover over on this look at this i can say hover hover hover i can actually change the background color to this so on the hover of this channel button i can change that so i can change the background color so i can say oh let's go you see as i hover over it but with the margin well look at this because we set the margin remember what i said about the margin guys this is where you had the issue with margin and padding i mean the difference between margin padding right yes what do i say margin is outside margin is the outside of the component itself that's margin padding is the inside that's interesting oh okay cool so that's so look at this if we want to include the change of the background color right but still create space what do we like to use then padding padding on margin so instead of doing margin i'm gonna say penny left 19 pixels and look at that oh let's go you see it's so it's so clean and nice yes okay let's do the same thing with these threads can we do that too these right here main channel item we'll say the same thing here we'll say hover hover also they will go ahead and also have a background color change on them as well okay save that oh let's go guys look at this we are pretty much done for day one of the react gs challenge look at what we have completed right here guys with you together we have ourselves a chat we have ourselves a what a header it looks so good you can type in the header if you want to we have ourselves a sidebar that looks so good and so clean so fresh so clean that's impossible to look at oh you have channels and so forth this right here is dynamic it's so cool but guess what it's going to get even even better as move on to day two and day three now guys at this point guys if you are still with us go ahead and smash that like button let's get to 700 likes guys and we're going to go on to finish up and do a quick q a with you all right now right before we do q a we have homework for you what's the homework so for the homework guys it's pretty simple for the homework here's what you should do number one let's do this on the show screen or what do you want to do no i have to show it on myself so number one let's go and do this here for the homework i actually do here for the homework um here pour smooth on this is your homework are you guys ready for this i hope you are okay so homework for part one is finish this app right now finish it finish the app to this point right if you haven't gotten to this point you could watch the replay that it's going to be available day one and finish day one yes completely so you have to be able to have an app just like this no problem okay part two here's what i want you to do for part two i want you remember how we made these right here elements kind of dynamic by creating a list a data list yes i want you guys do the same thing in the channels so convert channels to be dynamic and come from a list okay so you could look at the code above where you had the loop mapping things yeah create a json object with your channels yes and boom exactly you do that okay part three what should you give them for part three what do you think something something in terms of design i would say so i have an idea actually i have an idea okay what's the idea here's the idea i think what you guys should do because here they at the end of our at the end of all this our goal is to be able to you know to have no this basically designed what i want you guys to do is i want to go ahead and actually and actually i'm just thinking here for i want you to start on this section right here i want you to go ahead and guys create this actually no create this header section right here see this header section yeah in the chat box yes create this header section in the chat box that's all you need to do you need to create this inside the chat component inside the chat component guys make sense set the chat component that's pretty much it so let me go and type this out again okay create the the header in the chat component like above like that's it guys that's all you need to do and if you can and here's a has a bonus point here's a bonus point for four four if you can convert this for example to be the dark mode to have dark mode so let's say maybe i have curly light mode on but maybe there's a dark mode meaning you have to change the colors of all of these let's say for example change the colors of all of these you know sidebar the header and so forth can want this to have dark mode so forth or your own mode maybe you want to have a different colors for slack whatever colors you want to use for slack use it for yourself right be creative with it right maybe you want to use dark and white maybe you want to use green you know it's blue who knows but change it to your own color okay you have dark mode or your own mode right so if you want that's up to you make sense makes sense guys so go ahead right now screenshot what you have right now screenshot the homework of course we will go ahead and send you a facebook post an email and a discord post with all the homework instructions they will be there will we be providing the code some people are asking yes so our current code guys will actually be private on github so we'll probably provide you with the link there guys so to get that you need to be part of the challenge so if you're watching on youtube right now make sure to click the link below join the challenge because it's still not too late you could get started this is barely part one join the challenge you're gonna get all the homeworks we're gonna leave everything in the facebook community everything in the discord community we could be part of that challenge as well and you'll get the code you'll get all of this awesome homework you'll get the amazing engaged community all the positive and support you need to crush this challenge i mean the community right now is popping i mean i don't know if you guys know this but it's it's popping ha ha look at this let me just show it to you whoo look at this it's i mean look at people already posting homework look at that oh let's go you guys are epic look at this guys amazing look at this currently we have almost almost 305 people live oh but i'm not showing that right now look at this this is insane this is people posting right now look at this holy mole there you post the homework everything it's insane so much content let's go amazing this is epic you guys that's the community that you can join if you join the challenge yes so join the challenge guys join the community link is down in the description below if you are interested in something like that that's going to be the whole the whole you know that's just trust me the whole bang oh shabang guys but on that guys i want you to pat yourself in the back if you went ahead and you created this right now so pat pat you know danny on the back right here yeah oh my god i almost got wrecked so pat yourselves in the back for creating this it's been an amazing journey guys we killed it guys let's get to 700 likes and finish this specific what finish this live call 700 likes and we'll go in the meantime if you have any questions feel free to drop it down below and we'll ask any questions you have right now in the chat so you have any questions let me go and take a look at them what do we have well the discord channel be deleted after the challenge uh we're not sure about that that just yet maybe maybe not that's something we'll look but just in case reach out to people make friends network with people inside of this challenge so that you can start to build a community of your own of people who are likeminded and are programming as well just network guys be positive be optimistic right be nice to other people that's why that's why being being positive is so important in comments right because if you're a shitty person in the comments you're probably shitty person in real life too so and you probably won't make any friends and you won't make any connections and you have a very sad life i'm sorry that's just the s that's the truth of it you'll have a very sad life if you're very negative i know i said it you don't like it i'm sorry but that's the truth okay you hate uh things you you make mean comments you're not gonna have a good life period okay so when that's the technical question why do we use style.div instead of dot css is it better practice so style.div is how you guys create a div css is a separate file so if you want to create a css you'll create a css file and that's where you go ahead and add your css in our case we're using style components which allows us to actually for example if you could take a look at this if i let me kind of open up vs code right there you see style.div is kind of like declaring your own component with a style so it's a different way of creating styles and creating components korean styles uh so it's a little bit different but style div is is the kind of the you know the normal you can also do style style that span if you wanted to style that span and you know any other html element you want to do but in our case it's just div boom so listen to nas he's the master we have another question saying for the dark mode as part of the homework can we reference the portfolio or do we just use another js library or code it ourselves uh good question so for you guys what i would say so here let me go ahead um i want to brought it bring it up in the comments oh it was a mail right there right there yeah so for this one i would say just change up the color just change the background color of your css okay you don't have to like have a toggle or anything like that if you want to reference you know your portfolio that's fine but i would say don't reference it i would say just try to do it by yourself that's gonna be the you know your biggest way of learning um just change the background color of your left sidebar and the header and that's it and now you have dark mode you know it's as simple as that and if you want you can even change the color of the chat as well off your chat window so again this is where you get to be creative so we have muhammad asking the question can i get a job with this challenge project so so solely yes and no if this is your first project guys and this is your first experience in reactgs maybe not right guys this takes some time to build out yes we've had some people who've gotten projects or have gotten jobs right after doing the challenge and right after even right just by teaching people or just getting another job right but this is a career it's a career it's gonna last you for the next 10 20 30 years of course it's not gonna take you ten days or five days to build it i'm sorry it's just not the case you're going to have to put in more time you're going to have to put more projects more of your time and more of your energy into it and then you'll get the job but if you're just starting out just from zero this is a way to kickstart your career as a reigs developer right to go to get your interest into it to say holy there is possibility in it there's abilities in terms of what i can do in terms of what others can do and in terms of how i can change my life that's what this is for boom boom boom boom yes all right so we have another question that says how does a homework or does a homework have to be submitted well guys if you want to be part of the prizes that we have your homework does have to be submitted because that's going to be taken into consideration if you're engaging with the community not only that you can also start to get some feedback because if you're not getting feedback it's hard to know if you're making awesome progress or not yes exactly 100 so yes i met the homework guys i will give you the link in the facebook post and then the discord points and so forth can you uh says how to make this responsive we'll go over making a slide responsive later on guys don't worry about that just yet okay not just yet let me see okay what other question we have guys let me just put this here oh someone was asking this a lot we are at 697 likes bro what let's go 7. can we get to 700 come on 697 likes 700 likes 98. come on 698. we need two more 6.99 i don't have 99. can we get to 200 or 700 no come on 700 likes guys you guys got this what 700 700 and we are 700 likes let's go but he kept asking and i think that's a good point explain why i use the inspect tool because i see that you use that a lot and as a developer is that important knowledge yeah so inspector is actually really cool too guys check this out inspector is what allows us to get insight into how web pages are built right so for example let's say i go to node.js site okay just an example site here right all right let's just say google.cool.com this might be even better that's not google.com hold on hold on right there come on oh my gosh i know oh my gosh indeed so if i right click on the spectrum on this one look at this guys you see i inspect the element and this tells me things like okay here's the hide the image here right here we have the css right here so let me go ahead and this right here for example is this css right so this is such a cool part about with this because i can see what other developers are doing and how they are creating these things right object fit contain max height max width and so forth and i can not only learn from that i can copy it just for my learning purposes as well so inspect them is a very very useful tool right i can look at okay well how are these this being pretty see we have this one div that's a header right boom another div that's the google's logo then another div right here for example let's say this is the google logo another if that's the input you see it saw such a useful tool that i can learn from nonstop not only that it makes it easy to kind of test things because here i've seen nas change the styles to see how things change right like there he could change the pattern so guys for example for example sorry so yeah sorry actually go hiking whatever i mean literally you could just go to the styles that's all it's saying and you could change it and you could see what it would look like so it's a quick way to debug as well so for example if i do background color on here guys look at that i can actually change it in line for you for color for uh for google i can see back on color whoa did he just change google.com hey here we go now google.com is more like collaborative programmers yeah go to google.com right now and you'll see it's going to be orange no it's not actually orange because this is only in line this is only on my local machine if you go to yourgoogle.com it's going to be the exact one that it comes from and another thing is you can also if you click on that the very left button and you click on something on the computer it takes you to exact place of the code so it's easy to find wherever it is that you're looking for for example this is a search icon you can see this is the search icon right here if you want to look at the input the title whatever that is you could just click on it on the screen and it takes you to the exact place on code so it's very easy to debug using inspect tool oh same thing here right okay for example this button right here i'm gonna click on this button and this takes me to the button right here see this input button so simple right simple so this is why we use the inspect element tool as a developer i highly recommend you start to get used to it um and just start using it for your own good and just testing it out seeing what you can do as developer change things up hey go to facebook change some things up on facebook make it make it crazy make it fancy okay and of course this is only locally one you when you're like if i refresh this right now guys if i refresh this it's going back to normal to white right so of course so i'm not actually changing permanently i'm changing temporarily and that's where you want to use inspect exactly next question next question all right guys let's take just a couple more few more because we've been going at this and we want you guys to get on it and do the homeworks so tomorrow you could show up ready for part two yes i think pretty much at this point we're done guys okay at this point i think why do you sometimes amanda dev listen to put the subject so that's a good question actually so why do i put the semicolon and sometimes i don't put a semicolon why do you think that's the case well it depends it just depends how i feel it depends if nas is feeling it yeah so the semicolon you guys in javascript especially in the beginning you had to put semicolons at the end of the each line and so it was like a standard right uh now at this point it's not so much of a standard you don't have to put semicolons at the end of each line it's like basically it depends on how i feel about it it's you know i have a habit of doing it but sometimes i forget to do it uh because now at this point in javascript it is not the most important thing so you can put in anything you want potentially without the semicolon so yeah i think you only need the semicolon if you put a couple lines of code on the same line yes but that's that's bad code anyway so don't do that yeah yeah so yeah so that's the only reason make sense all right so guys that's pretty much it so guys guys oh if you feel semicolon jody is like that's actually funny he says i'm a sema colonistic he adds it anyways guys that case thank you all so much for watching thank you so much for joining us for coding along with us of course we will be the discord we will be in the facebook group we'll put the homework post in there everything's going to be in there okay so guys that was it for part one day two of the slack clone we did the header we did the sidebar tomorrow we're gonna dive deeper into this so come back at 11 00 a.m pst st if you haven't joined the challenge click the link below so you could be part of the amazing community and you could be part of the amazing uh what the prizes that we are giving as well and to join and be part of that yes part of the full stack mastery bootcamp guys that's the sick part guys anyways guys thank you all so much have a great day and we'll see you in the next video you
