00:12 - much much higher so not only are you
00:15 - bogged down by the conceptual difficulty
00:17 - when you're first learning computer
00:19 - programming you're also bogged down by
00:22 - the same tactical difficulty just focus
00:25 - on the conceptual stuff first okay so
00:28 - start with something that has a

00:32 - recommendation to you guys would be
00:34 - python remember Google Dropbox Pinterest
00:38 - Reddit Instagram those were all built
