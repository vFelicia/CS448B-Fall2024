00:00 - - Alright, in the last video
we talked about variables,
00:02 - you can see some basic examples.
00:04 - I stored all this information
in the variable bob.
00:08 - And then as soon as I typed in bob,
00:09 - I got back all of bob's information.
00:13 - Just a quick thing I wanna
say before I continue,
00:15 - if any of you are having
problems downloading
00:17 - and installing this Python
stuff that I've shown you,
00:20 - if you're on Windows or a
Mac or any other system,
00:24 - I wanna show you a quick...
00:25 - I wanna really quickly show you a website,
00:28 - where you can get all of this information
00:32 - or you can pretty much do everything
00:34 - we've been doing right on here.
00:37 - The website is called trinket.io, okay.
00:41 - And here's how it works.
00:43 - So on the right hand side,
00:45 - you can see that if I
run all of this code,
00:49 - it draws all of that stuff, okay?
00:52 - And they have a bunch of great
00:53 - examples for you guys to try out.
00:56 - So you can go to Python
and you can discover
00:59 - a bunch of great examples that you can do.
01:02 - Okay so for example, you can
look at this example here,
01:07 - and maybe get an idea of
how to make some really
01:11 - cool shapes using the
turtle module in Python.
01:15 - Okay, so...
01:18 - Let's stop their code
and let's start ours.
01:21 - So if I do import turtle here,
01:23 - and I do my turtle or you know,
01:27 - you can call it really whatever you want.
01:29 - You can call it my_john if you want,
01:31 - is equal to turtle.Turtle
01:34 - and if I say, my_john.forward(100)
01:41 - and I run this,
01:45 - invalid object has no...
01:46 - Okay, I misspelled turtle here.
01:49 - Run it.
01:50 - And you can see that it
draws a turtle going forward.
01:52 - Now let me bring back their code,
01:56 - and let's do it, so for example
01:59 - where it says black here let's write blue.
02:03 - Okay, pen color.
02:05 - Background color that is.
02:07 - So you see, we changed
the background color.
02:09 - So that's a good way to see
what this stuff is doing.
02:12 - You can change this color to orange maybe
02:15 - and see what that does.
02:17 - Okay, so the first turtle that gets drawn,
02:19 - is actually being drawn
by an orange color.
02:21 - Okay, so...
02:23 - Great place to come and
try out stuff, okay.
02:26 - trinket.io
02:29 - Now going back to learning about strings.
02:34 - So let's go over here
and strings is literally
02:38 - the exact thing that you type, okay.
02:40 - So let's say I wanted
to say, "Hello world."
02:43 - If I did print hello world,
02:45 - I would get back an error.
02:46 - And the error would say,
02:48 - "Invalid syntax, I don't
know what you mean."
02:50 - So let's try to type
it in the Python 3 way,
02:53 - where you have to put a
parentheses after print
02:56 - because print is something called
02:57 - a function which we will cover it later.
03:00 - So let's try hello like
this and hit Enter.
03:04 - And you can see the error I get it says,
03:07 - "Hmmm, name hello is not defined."
03:10 - So, it has no idea what you're talking
03:13 - about when you write hello here.
03:15 - It's looking for the variable hello,
03:18 - we have the variable bob here,
03:20 - we have the variable X,
03:21 - but we never defined variable hello.
03:24 - But you're like, "No that's
not what I'm trying to tell it.
03:26 - "I'm trying to tell it, to
exactly like say hello."
03:31 - Not some variable hello
that might have some
03:33 - numbers in it or something
like that, right?
03:36 - It's not like you're doing
hello is equal to five
03:39 - and then printing out hello
and it gives you five.
03:43 - Well, in this case if you want it
03:45 - to say exactly what you want it to say,
03:47 - you have to use something called a string.
03:49 - So that just simply means,
putting that thing in quotes.
03:53 - So now Python goes,
03:54 - "Oh, you want me to say
exactly hello like this."
03:57 - And it'll say hello.
03:58 - Now let's say I wanted
to say print hello world.
04:01 - Right, if I do space here,
04:04 - it's just gonna give me an error.
04:05 - It's gonna be like,
04:06 - a variable with a space
in between a variable,
04:09 - I have no idea what you mean.
04:11 - So now, if you put both
of these in quotes,
04:14 - it'll go, oh you want
the string that literally
04:17 - says hello world exactly like that,
04:20 - I understand, I got you,
let me do it for you.
04:24 - Okay, simple enough?
04:26 - Cool, that's it for strings.
04:29 - I'm gonna keep it really simple.
04:30 - I'll see you in the next video.
