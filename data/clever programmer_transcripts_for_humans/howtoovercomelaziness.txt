00:01 - hey guys what's up this is kazy from
00:03 - clever
00:06 - program.com don't be
00:09 - lazy one of the worst things that we can
00:12 - do as people that I have come to learn
00:15 - over time is simply being
00:20 - lazy your ideas are a lot more precious
00:25 - than you guys think your ideas are a lot
00:27 - more valuable than you might
00:32 - think all you have to do to make them a
00:35 - reality is not being lazy a lot of
00:39 - people say there's not enough time in 24
00:42 - hours right that is something that I
00:46 - totally disagree
00:47 - with because the reason is that if you
00:50 - manage your time effectively 24 hours is
00:53 - really all you
00:56 - need you can get way more done in 20
01:01 - hours if you use it
01:03 - effectively and how do you use it
01:06 - effectively by simply not being
01:09 - lazy and realistically laziness is
01:13 - something that comes from you know being
01:16 - too
01:17 - comfortable with what you're doing and
01:21 - that is something that was happening to
01:22 - me as well you know I try to be as
01:25 - productive as I can but it's it's very
01:28 - difficult I'm learning how how to be I'm
01:30 - trying to change my
01:32 - habits but it's not an easy task but if
01:37 - you can constantly put yourself in
01:41 - different situations if you constantly
01:43 - try to change your habits to where you
01:46 - are trying to master your habits rather
01:49 - than your habits being the master of
01:51 - you you will effectively start to defeat
01:55 - laziness it might not completely leave
01:57 - you but it'll start getting lower and
01:59 - lower
02:01 - lower because realistically it's one of
02:03 - the worst things that can happen I mean
02:05 - for example right now okay what can you
02:07 - do to get yourself to be un lazy what
02:10 - can you do to make yourself a little bit
02:13 - more uncomfortable there always
02:15 - something you can do to make yourself a
02:17 - little bit more
02:18 - uncomfortable if you are setting goals
02:20 - that you're constantly meeting you're
02:23 - being lazy because you are getting
02:26 - comfortable because you're able to reach
02:28 - those goals constantly you need to
02:31 - increase the barrier to where you need
02:32 - to go right you need to if you think
02:35 - that you know I want to make this amount
02:38 - of money by the end of this month and
02:40 - you constantly keep doing that then you
02:43 - get comfortable and now you're not going
02:45 - to make more money than that amount
02:47 - because that's just what you're going to
02:49 - keep doing because you get lazy when you
02:51 - get
02:52 - comfortable right if it comes to
02:55 - education and you're trying to learn
02:57 - something and you go you know I'm going
02:59 - to study
03:01 - one to two hours a week or something and
03:03 - you constantly keep meeting that goal
03:05 - and you never fail to meet any of your
03:07 - goals you are being lazy what should you
03:11 - do I don't know maybe increase the
03:16 - time to where it's really hard for you
03:18 - to meet it for example instead of 2
03:20 - hours maybe make it 3 hours 4 hours and
03:24 - if you are failing to meet
03:26 - it but you're getting closer
03:30 - you're effectively starting to get
03:32 - closer and closer to your goal right if
03:34 - you're studying 3 hours now but you
03:35 - can't reach the 4H hour goal but isn't
03:37 - it still better than the 2-hour goal
03:39 - that you had previously set
03:43 - up okay I
03:45 - mean it it really there always ways okay
03:50 - for example it's like 30 it's like 30
03:52 - something degrees right now in Chicago
03:53 - okay and I'm just going to go ahead and
03:54 - open the windows it's it's freezing okay
03:58 - it's extremely cold
04:00 - can you guys see
04:03 - that but I'm doing that because that
04:06 - allows me to not be lazy that allows me
04:09 - to not be a victim to my circumstances
04:13 - okay it's very little but I'm
04:14 - effectively taking control over the
04:17 - situation okay and instead of just being
04:19 - like Oh my God I'm so like cold and I
04:21 - need a blanket at all times and I need
04:23 - some kind of crutch and you're just like
04:26 - whatever and you will realize that your
04:28 - body will start hard to withstand those
04:30 - things your mind will strengthen itself
04:34 - to the point where it is actually able
04:36 - to deal with those things deal with the
04:40 - obstacles that come in its way like my
04:42 - YouTube channel my goal was to get to a
04:45 - th000 subscribers by the end of December
04:48 - right now it's November 27th I believe
04:51 - today or 28th I could be wrong but my
04:54 - goal is to reach thousand subscribers by
04:56 - December 31st or January 1st
05:01 - okay when I set this goal that was back
05:05 - in August I believe like around October
05:09 - almost I set this goal and I had like 50
05:13 - subscribers and I was getting maybe
05:15 - like the best week I've had the best
05:18 - month I had was like 100 something
05:20 - subscribers okay so I I was growing my
05:23 - channel very slowly and I was producing
05:25 - content every day like I was producing
05:29 - content seven times a week you know I I
05:32 - have about 80 uploads at this point but
05:35 - I kept setting goals that were so high
05:38 - right people were like make two videos a
05:41 - month make three videos a month four
05:43 - videos a month I was like how about I
05:45 - set it higher how about I make more than
05:50 - that so then I was thinking maybe one
05:53 - video a week or or or two videos a week
05:57 - but I ended up kind of just going crazy
05:58 - and I did seven videos a week so then
06:01 - the times I wasn't able to meet my
06:06 - goal I made four videos a
06:10 - week do you see how that's better than
06:12 - setting my goal to be one video a week
06:16 - because if I don't meet that goal then I
06:18 - make zero videos granted I might be able
06:20 - to meet that goal every single week but
06:24 - come on like that's I can do better than
06:26 - that you can do better than that right
06:30 - we're we're so afraid of failure we're
06:33 - so afraid of failing at things but
06:36 - that's really how you get good at
06:38 - something right what's the difference
06:40 - between a winner and a
06:43 - loser the difference is that Los the
06:46 - winner has failed more times than the
06:51 - loser okay I'm going to say this one
06:54 - more time the difference between the
06:56 - winner and the loser is that the winner
06:58 - has failed more times than the loser
07:01 - what do I mean by
07:03 - that let's take anything that you are
07:06 - better in than somebody
07:11 - else the constant Factor the the factor
07:14 - that you will find most of the times to
07:16 - be true is that you have failed at that
07:19 - thing more times than the other person
07:21 - take take somebody who is uh the
07:24 - professional Pi you know pianist like
07:26 - Beethoven for example you know he he's
07:29 - an amazing pianist and uh probably
07:32 - saying it wrong I'm sorry
07:35 - but why is he so good at his task why is
07:38 - he better than me who has failed more
07:41 - times at that he
07:43 - did why might I or somebody else be
07:47 - better in computer programming than you
07:51 - because we have failed more
07:53 - times why might you be better at a task
07:56 - than myself because you have filled more
07:59 - times at that
08:00 - task so do not be afraid of your
08:05 - failures all
08:07 - right use them to get to where you want
08:11 - to
08:13 - go they are very strong
08:17 - indicators in terms of whether you're
08:20 - reaching the right direction or not
08:22 - let's say you see somebody at the gym I
08:25 - just came from the gym so that's why I'm
08:26 - using that example but let's say you you
08:29 - know you go to the
08:30 - gym if you lift like 2 lb
08:34 - dumbbells you can probably do 100 reps
08:37 - easy no problem you can do that every
08:39 - single day and if that was your goal you
08:42 - are meeting your goal every single time
08:47 - right but how do you know whether you're
08:49 - improving or
08:52 - not you really don't it's very tough to
08:57 - tell but let's say that you set your
09:00 - goal to to do uh you're going to lift a
09:03 - 20 lb dumbbell or a 30 lb dumbbell or a
09:06 - 50 lb dumbbell and you
09:09 - fail right you do a few reps but you
09:14 - fail now you see that that's your next
09:18 - step so you work your way towards
09:20 - getting to that 30 lbs and now it starts
09:22 - to get comfortable
09:24 - again now you need to set your goal to
09:26 - 50 lb and you fail the 50 lb and now you
09:30 - know that you got to keep going higher
09:32 - and
09:33 - higher right to actually meet that goal
09:36 - and your failure is what actually tells
09:38 - you where you need to go because if you
09:40 - constantly kept being
09:42 - successful I mean in weightlifting you
09:44 - know that that's too easy for you right
09:46 - but in real life we don't tend to think
09:49 - of it that way we just go oh you know
09:51 - I'm just I'm glad I'm feeling safe I'm
09:53 - feeling secure let me just get this job
09:56 - and latch on to it let me not try to
09:59 - reach for something more let me not try
10:01 - to do something that is a little bit
10:04 - risky even though I think it might be
10:05 - right but I don't want to take that risk
10:08 - I don't want to take that chance because
10:09 - I'm afraid of failure and effectively I
10:12 - am being
10:15 - lazy all right sorry guys I don't want
10:19 - this to go on for too long I just had a
10:22 - thought that I wanted to share with you
10:23 - guys I hope you guys like it please
10:26 - comment below what is your biggest
10:29 - barrier to where you need to go right
10:30 - now and why is that your barrier okay
10:34 - let me let me know below okay what's
10:38 - what's making you lazy what's stopping
10:40 - you from reaching your
10:43 - goals I'll respond to every single one
10:45 - of you take care guys I love every
10:47 - single one of you I will see you in the
10:49 - next video

hey guys what's up this is kazy from clever program.com don't be lazy one of the worst things that we can do as people that I have come to learn over time is simply being lazy your ideas are a lot more precious than you guys think your ideas are a lot more valuable than you might think all you have to do to make them a reality is not being lazy a lot of people say there's not enough time in 24 hours right that is something that I totally disagree with because the reason is that if you manage your time effectively 24 hours is really all you need you can get way more done in 20 hours if you use it effectively and how do you use it effectively by simply not being lazy and realistically laziness is something that comes from you know being too comfortable with what you're doing and that is something that was happening to me as well you know I try to be as productive as I can but it's it's very difficult I'm learning how how to be I'm trying to change my habits but it's not an easy task but if you can constantly put yourself in different situations if you constantly try to change your habits to where you are trying to master your habits rather than your habits being the master of you you will effectively start to defeat laziness it might not completely leave you but it'll start getting lower and lower lower because realistically it's one of the worst things that can happen I mean for example right now okay what can you do to get yourself to be un lazy what can you do to make yourself a little bit more uncomfortable there always something you can do to make yourself a little bit more uncomfortable if you are setting goals that you're constantly meeting you're being lazy because you are getting comfortable because you're able to reach those goals constantly you need to increase the barrier to where you need to go right you need to if you think that you know I want to make this amount of money by the end of this month and you constantly keep doing that then you get comfortable and now you're not going to make more money than that amount because that's just what you're going to keep doing because you get lazy when you get comfortable right if it comes to education and you're trying to learn something and you go you know I'm going to study one to two hours a week or something and you constantly keep meeting that goal and you never fail to meet any of your goals you are being lazy what should you do I don't know maybe increase the time to where it's really hard for you to meet it for example instead of 2 hours maybe make it 3 hours 4 hours and if you are failing to meet it but you're getting closer you're effectively starting to get closer and closer to your goal right if you're studying 3 hours now but you can't reach the 4H hour goal but isn't it still better than the 2hour goal that you had previously set up okay I mean it it really there always ways okay for example it's like 30 it's like 30 something degrees right now in Chicago okay and I'm just going to go ahead and open the windows it's it's freezing okay it's extremely cold can you guys see that but I'm doing that because that allows me to not be lazy that allows me to not be a victim to my circumstances okay it's very little but I'm effectively taking control over the situation okay and instead of just being like Oh my God I'm so like cold and I need a blanket at all times and I need some kind of crutch and you're just like whatever and you will realize that your body will start hard to withstand those things your mind will strengthen itself to the point where it is actually able to deal with those things deal with the obstacles that come in its way like my YouTube channel my goal was to get to a th000 subscribers by the end of December right now it's November 27th I believe today or 28th I could be wrong but my goal is to reach thousand subscribers by December 31st or January 1st okay when I set this goal that was back in August I believe like around October almost I set this goal and I had like 50 subscribers and I was getting maybe like the best week I've had the best month I had was like 100 something subscribers okay so I I was growing my channel very slowly and I was producing content every day like I was producing content seven times a week you know I I have about 80 uploads at this point but I kept setting goals that were so high right people were like make two videos a month make three videos a month four videos a month I was like how about I set it higher how about I make more than that so then I was thinking maybe one video

better than setting my goal to be one video a week because if I don't meet that goal then I make zero videos granted I might be able to meet that goal every single week but come on like that's I can do better than that you can do better than that right we're we're so afraid of failure we're so afraid of failing at things but that's really how you get good at something right what's the difference between a winner and a loser the difference is that Los the winner has failed more times than the loser okay I'm going to say this one more time the difference between the winner and the loser is that the winner has failed more times than the loser what do I mean by that let's take anything that you are better in than somebody else the constant Factor the the factor that you will find most of the times to be true is that you have failed at that thing more times than the other person take take somebody who is uh the professional Pi you know pianist like Beethoven for example you know he he's an amazing pianist and uh probably saying it wrong I'm sorry but why is he so good at his task why is he better than me who has failed more times at that he did why might I or somebody else be better in computer programming than you because we have failed more times why might you be better at a task than myself because you have filled more times at that task so do not be afraid of your failures all right use them to get to where you want to go they are very strong indicators in terms of whether you're reaching the right direction or not let's say you see somebody at the gym I just came from the gym so that's why I'm using that example but let's say you you know you go to the gym if you lift like 2 lb dumbbells you can probably do 100 reps easy no problem you can do that every single day and if that was your goal you are meeting your goal every single time right but how do you know whether you're improving or not you really don't it's very tough to tell but let's say that you set your goal to to do uh you're going to lift a 20 lb dumbbell or a 30 lb dumbbell or a 50 lb dumbbell and you fail right you do a few reps but you fail now you see that that's your next step so you work your way towards getting to that 30 lbs and now it starts to get comfortable again now you need to set your goal to 50 lb and you fail the 50 lb and now you know that you got to keep going higher and higher right to actually meet that goal and your failure is what actually tells you where you need to go because if you constantly kept being successful I mean in weightlifting you know that that's too easy for you right but in real life we don't tend to think of it that way we just go oh you know I'm just I'm glad I'm feeling safe I'm feeling secure let me just get this job and latch on to it
