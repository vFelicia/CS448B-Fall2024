00:00 - hey you what's up this is qazi from
00:02 - cleverprogrammer.com and in this video
00:04 - i'm going to tackle robert lillyblatt's
00:06 - question essentially he wants to know
00:08 - what makes you a python expert
00:11 - he wrote a big message but that's the
00:13 - gist of that message so i'm going to
00:15 - tackle that one okay let's jump right
00:17 - into it
00:19 - [Music]
00:28 - [Applause]
00:29 - so
00:30 - what defines an expert that's a good
00:32 - question and i've been getting that
00:33 - quite frequently now so i decided to
00:37 - just kind of answer it for you guys okay
00:39 - what defines again an expert somewhere
00:41 - else like in english or whatever
00:44 - there's no
00:46 - like one thing there's no specific thing
00:48 - that makes you an expert or the ultimate
00:50 - authority it's accumulation accumulation
00:53 - of multiple things
00:55 - so for example i wouldn't say years of
00:58 - experience though that certainly helps
01:00 - and that's what most people will use but
01:02 - having built projects that are useful
01:05 - around it that is something that takes
01:07 - you a step closer to being an expert but
01:09 - there's no list of like build a
01:11 - calculator app build this build this and
01:13 - now you're an expert but if you're
01:16 - working with like if you're creating
01:18 - multiple projects using python or you
01:20 - get proficient in speaking python like
01:23 - you get proficient in speaking any other
01:25 - language and you start start to create
01:28 - things that are actually useful to
01:29 - yourself and to other people and it's
01:31 - not you're not just stuck in the basic
01:33 - level anymore that's when you start to
01:35 - get into the level of being an expert
01:38 - okay once you start becoming very fluent
01:40 - with it so that's what you should be
01:42 - focusing on and there's no again there's
01:44 - no single defining line there's nothing
01:47 - that you just cross over and then all of
01:49 - a sudden you become an expert it takes
01:51 - time
01:52 - it takes obviously experience which
01:54 - comes with time and it takes a certain
01:56 - level of skill and building actual
01:58 - projects that are useful to you or other
02:00 - people okay that's how i'm gonna answer
02:02 - this question thank you guys for
02:04 - watching and i'll see you in the next
02:06 - video
