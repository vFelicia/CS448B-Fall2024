11:16 - come in talk about so many topics
11:19 - guys you will get to learn things like
11:23 - i mean besides just learning now what's
11:25 - the most important thing about these
11:27 - conferences
11:27 - is one what is it well part part of it
11:30 - is networking
11:33 - networking that's right oh let me see
11:36 - not working
11:37 - you will be part of an amazing community
11:41 - right you will learn some upcoming
11:44 - technologies like for example typescript
11:47 - oh it's all disappearing it's okay
11:51 - like for example typescript right like
11:54 - for example
11:56 - tail and css right
11:59 - like for example you know react.js will
12:02 - have amazing workshops with react.js
12:04 - with tail and css typescript
12:06 - we will have amazing workshops and guest
12:09 - speakers come in and talk about their
12:10 - opportunity
12:11 - we'll have mastermind workshops for
12:14 - example where you guys get
12:15 - the chance to work on your mindset right
12:18 - mastermind workshops
12:22 - we will have workshops around money so
12:25 - as a developer how do you actually make
12:27 - money and how do you reinvest that money
12:28 - right
12:29 - so investing money
12:33 - and so much more but the most important
12:35 - is that this is not this just covers
12:37 - like the nothing
12:38 - of it okay jesse what's some of the most
12:40 - important things that we'll learn from
12:41 - this
12:44 - i think the most important thing is
12:47 - to see that once you learn code
12:51 - all of the beautiful things that are
12:53 - possible for you
12:55 - all the beautiful technologies the
12:56 - tailwind the typescript
12:58 - the you know those are all frameworks
13:00 - but we're also going to be talking about
13:02 - you know what's artificial intelligence
13:04 - what's
13:05 - you know other technologies hardware
13:07 - basically
13:08 - getting you guys introduced to the world
13:11 - of technology and especially this is so
13:13 - important
13:14 - when you want to make a career switch
13:16 - into software development let's say
13:19 - no because i often see people very
13:21 - focused only on programming
13:23 - learning the language itself but
13:24 - actually not knowing
13:26 - what you can really really do with it
13:30 - how cool would it be you started
13:32 - programming
13:33 - for example and suddenly you realize wow
13:36 - i could make a virtual reality game
13:40 - i could do game development i could
13:43 - you know invent the next alexa
13:46 - stuff like that you know and that's
13:48 - really important with these kind of
13:49 - conferences to
13:50 - get open-minded to broaden your horizon
13:53 - basically
13:54 - and meet like-minded people of course
13:56 - most important thing guys is going to be
13:58 - your connections that you meet on here
13:59 - okay
13:59 - there will be over 100 people at the
14:02 - event so
14:03 - basically what i'm trying to say here
14:05 - say here is
14:06 - be there because the thing is the
14:08 - connections you make
14:10 - are the most important important things
14:12 - you do in life
14:14 - for example for me right the way i
14:16 - became who i
14:17 - am is because the connections that i
14:18 - have all of my jobs that i had as
14:20 - developer were because of the
14:22 - connections that i have
14:23 - right even being here clever programmer
14:26 - to teach you right now right
14:27 - to have all these courses to have the
14:29 - boot camps it was all because the
14:31 - connections that i had
14:32 - okay connections are the key and this
14:34 - might be the missing link in your
14:37 - career up and coming careers developer
14:40 - you guys might be struggling you guys i
14:41 - think figuring out hey how do i just
14:42 - keep going how do i just keep doing
14:44 - this well the what's missing link here
14:46 - is you just don't know every
14:47 - do not know anybody let me ask you this
14:50 - who does not know anybody right now
14:52 - around development recording so many
14:54 - people look at this
14:56 - but yet you want to go into that field
14:59 - how does that work out right you want to
15:02 - go into that field but yet at the same
15:03 - time you don't know anybody in that
15:04 - field
15:06 - raise your hand if you agree with me
15:07 - that if you want to go somewhere you
15:09 - have to
15:10 - find people who are already there and
15:12 - learn from them do you agree with that
15:15 - do you agree with that 100 that's right
15:18 - so let me ask you this anybody here

20:18 - everyone's christian careers
20:20 - um one thing and it's also one of the
20:22 - most important
20:23 - values in my life i guess is freedom so
20:27 - so money is equal to freedom but also i
20:30 - like
20:31 - doing the remote working style as a
20:33 - developer being able to work from home
20:35 - or from any place that i want to work
20:37 - with who that i
20:38 - who i want you know um yeah
20:42 - basically flexibility that'll be cool to
20:44 - go from anywhere in the world
20:46 - that to me is the best if you if you had
20:48 - the chance to work from anywhere in the
20:49 - world who would love that
20:52 - yeah i know i know that would be amazing
20:54 - that would be amazing
20:55 - i'll thank you guys because i live in
20:57 - amsterdam but i work with the guys who
21:00 - are based in l.a
21:01 - absolutely look at how that goes that
21:03 - works that right there breaks the
21:05 - barrier you're thinking hey
21:06 - you know what but i'm in this country
21:08 - and i don't have any jobs in this
21:09 - country that by the way just breaks the
21:10 - barrier fully okay
21:12 - in that there's jobs everywhere now and
21:14 - because of the internet you can
21:16 - technically be at that place as well
21:17 - so it breaks that barrier for you so
21:19 - easily okay guys
21:21 - nice okay financial freedom support your
21:24 - family right
21:24 - having more time to spend with your
21:26 - loved ones these are these are so such
21:28 - important things
21:29 - now let's figure out your income goals
21:30 - okay how much income do you want to make
21:32 - per month as a developer
21:34 - okay let me ask you that question
21:38 - i'll have something a lot tenth day per
21:40 - month guys let's be realistic guys now
21:42 - don't don't tell me a hundred thousand
21:43 - dollars per month okay
21:44 - that's not realistic okay adrienne
21:48 - are we reaching for the stars let me say
21:51 - as much as jeff bezos okay
21:53 - so uh jesse what's a good income
21:57 - income per month when you when they
21:59 - start out when developers start out
22:00 - tell me um i think it depends a little
22:04 - bit where you live
22:05 - for example so i know that californian
22:08 - software developers might earn more
22:10 - than on the east coast um but european
22:13 - software developers earn
22:14 - even more than american ones not always
22:18 - really you guys what depends depends
22:21 - where you work
22:22 - that's what you want that's not cool it
22:24 - depends what's funny when you work as a
22:26 - european for an american company in
22:28 - europe
22:29 - then that's when you earn more somehow
22:32 - anyways
22:32 - um so it depends where you live first of
22:34 - all guys second is
22:36 - um what's a good start well if you're
22:38 - doing first if you're being hired as an
22:40 - intern that's of course very different
22:42 - from if you're being hired as a
22:44 - full stack junior developer of course
22:47 - that's right that's right that's right
22:48 - that's right
22:49 - so i think you know more about it give
22:51 - me give me a number
22:52 - just just give me a number i think 50k
22:54 - dollars it would be a good start
22:56 - 50 to 70k dollars annual income annually
22:58 - so that would per month that would be
23:00 - around
23:01 - probably three thousand to four thousand
23:02 - a month okay yeah three thousand a month
23:04 - okay okay thank god
23:09 - per month okay so
23:12 - 4 000 per month okay is is a good
23:15 - average income you might start out with
23:16 - as you become more of a student
23:18 - developer
23:18 - you're looking to increase that you know
23:20 - 5k 6k 7k
23:22 - i know ten thousand dollars to fifty
23:24 - thousand dollars just developers making
23:25 - three hundred
23:26 - thousand dollars per year yeah that's an
23:28 - income that's possible
23:29 - do you want to freelance or full time
23:30 - that's a good question there's freelance
23:32 - okay and there's full time what's your
23:35 - decision let me ask you that
23:37 - freelance or full time free lens for
23:39 - lens or maybe even both maybe you want
23:41 - to do both
23:43 - maybe you want to do both like jesse
23:46 - what would you what do you like about
23:47 - what do you like most
23:50 - both but i like freelance a little bit
23:53 - more okay
23:54 - so you like both but you like freelance
23:56 - why is that
23:58 - so this is the thing there's always i
24:00 - always say like you know a coin always
24:01 - has two sides right
24:02 - if you're a freelancer that's great you
24:04 - got all the flexibility you can do
24:06 - whatever you want basically but it also
24:07 - sometimes means you have to work 24 7
24:10 - and also acquire clients yourself
24:13 - however when you do when you're working
24:15 - full-time in office
24:16 - the clients come to you well if your
24:18 - company is doing good right
24:20 - um and then you're working there plus
24:22 - you have a team
24:23 - you have a support you have you know
24:26 - teammates you can learn from when you're
24:27 - freelancing you're often by yourself
24:29 - unless you create your own team
24:31 - but when you start out as a freelancer
24:33 - that's often not the case okay so it
24:35 - depends a little bit i like to combine
24:36 - it
24:37 - um freelance for me would be more like a
24:39 - hobby that just pays me
24:41 - you know doing something for fun and
24:42 - then get paid for it but
24:44 - um yeah so there are there's
24:47 - just depends on what your lifestyle is
24:49 - and what you like that's right
24:50 - that's right that's right a lot of
24:51 - people are saying full time i'm looking
24:53 - at a chat right now
24:54 - a lot of people are saying full time a
24:56 - lot of people saying um
24:59 - okay a lot of people by the way tutorial
25:01 - if you guys look at the tutorial
25:02 - tutorial is going to begin tomorrow guys
25:03 - today is the
25:04 - opportunity to become a developer okay
25:05 - guys all right let's see
25:09 - both both freelance both both both yeah
25:11 - of course there's ups and downs with
25:13 - with either so with freelance it's
25:15 - awesome because that gives free that's
25:16 - freedom
25:17 - i see this as more of a freedom role
25:20 - where you can work from anywhere you
25:21 - want
25:21 - you decide when you want to go out we
25:24 - decide when you want to stop
25:25 - work but the issue with that is you're
25:27 - pretty much working every single day
25:29 - like
25:29 - it's not easy to get clients it's not
25:31 - easy to actually
25:33 - you know uh be someone who's credited
25:36 - that takes time like
25:37 - to be somebody who on upwork makes a lot
25:40 - of money
25:42 - that takes time so i want to want you
25:43 - guys to be realistic with this at the
25:45 - same time okay
25:46 - don't think that you can be on the beach
25:48 - coding and making a
25:50 - [ __ ] ton of money you know uh but and
25:53 - that's it
25:53 - it doesn't work that way it's it's
25:55 - [ __ ] hard okay and i'll just i'm i'm
25:57 - looking that following i'm using the
25:58 - file language too
25:59 - because for a purpose because i want to
26:01 - say that you know what this is actually
26:03 - really hard
26:04 - okay full time also really hard but with
26:06 - full time the
26:07 - cool thing is is you can get a job as a
26:10 - developer
26:11 - and even as a junior developer and you
26:13 - can be learning
26:14 - amongst a lot of people you see that's
26:16 - the thing
26:17 - with freelancers you're pretty much on

27:07 - jobs than students by 2020 what does
27:09 - this mean
27:10 - whoa there's a lot more so think about
27:13 - the list it's like
27:14 - this is this is what this means there's
27:16 - demand
27:18 - uh one the demand is high
27:23 - yeah demand is high the supply
27:26 - is low
27:31 - supply is low okay yeah supply of
27:33 - developers

29:32 - but i also know people who are making
29:34 - sixty thousand dollars and fifty
29:36 - thousand dollars right so there's
29:37 - there's two sides of the coin the better

31:11 - adrian says i love it working in pajamas
31:13 - is awesome
31:14 - i know i do too i do too i'm working
31:16 - remotely right now i mean i'm attacking
31:18 - an office here but i'm working from my
31:20 - home right now
31:21 - that's right so why javascript is
31:23 - something that's a good question
31:24 - why javascript anybody here knows why
31:27 - javascript
31:29 - who knows why javascript well i have a
31:32 - very simple answer for it
31:33 - because i love it and because i think
31:36 - you should love it too
31:37 - it's as simple as that okay it's as
31:39 - simple as that
31:40 - so why do you love it nice
31:43 - i don't know it's just so good you know
31:45 - it's just like it's like
31:46 - but what makes it so good then because
31:48 - you cannot just love something because
31:49 - it's
31:50 - sure you can why not it's just so good
31:54 - who says i love it too but
31:58 - yeah i just like it i like it but
32:02 - yeah so why do you why do you love a
32:05 - jesse here's a good question why do you
32:06 - like it jesse
32:07 - so what i like about javascript is that
32:10 - um
32:11 - syntax is compared to other programming
32:14 - languages like c
32:15 - or java it's pretty um
32:18 - [Music]
32:19 - what's the english word um it's like a
32:22 - language like a natural language
32:24 - normal language okay that said
32:27 - at the same time you know what i noticed
32:30 - with python for example
32:31 - um if you do things in python you don't
32:34 - really know what's happening under the
32:36 - hood
32:36 - but with javascript you are able to find
32:39 - that out
32:40 - so i think working with javascript
32:43 - therefore gives you so much more control
32:45 - and of course i love working with react
32:48 - and react is working with the components
32:50 - and how the components render out that's
32:52 - also
32:52 - actually how my brain works how to
32:55 - design an app so that's why i love
32:56 - working with javascript
32:58 - because it makes me allows me to use
33:00 - react actually yeah
33:01 - i like i like it because it's visual
33:03 - that's it that's why i like it i like it
33:05 - because
33:05 - yeah that's why i like it okay yeah yeah
33:08 - so
33:08 - most used programmers this out so most
33:11 - use programming language among
33:12 - developers worldwide
33:13 - javascript right there boom okay then
33:16 - instead we have html css
33:17 - i would not consider this a programming
33:19 - language but i guess it still is
33:20 - so there you go html css we have sql
33:24 - python java c-sharp and so forth
33:28 - right now the reason why this is
33:29 - becoming so popular is because
33:31 - actually javascript is starting to get
33:32 - used to for a lot it because it's not
33:34 - only used for
33:36 - web development it's also used for the
33:38 - following it's also used for things like
33:41 - um mobile development right right
33:44 - so ios android right so ios
33:48 - ios and also android okay
33:54 - and that is very popular if you can
33:55 - build using javascript
33:58 - for ios and android you're solid my
34:00 - friends you're solid
34:02 - next thing we have this is a stack
34:04 - overflow survey which is the biggest
34:06 - survey
34:06 - in the world around developers and look
34:09 - at this right there it just shows you
34:10 - right there
34:11 - javascript html css the top languages
34:13 - right there easy
34:14 - web frameworks react.js so we focus a
34:17 - lot on reactgs as well
34:18 - that's the biggest framework that we
34:20 - like to focus on because it's
34:21 - also one of the most biggest ones that
34:23 - people use right now
34:25 - okay so here's a good question what can
34:28 - you
34:28 - do with javascript answer that
34:32 - in the comment below what can you do
34:34 - with javascript
34:35 - roman says everything
34:38 - take over the world games that's a very
34:41 - good one monique
34:42 - that's right games that's right that's
34:45 - right that's right fly the moon well i
34:46 - mean you can try that too
34:49 - blockchain blockchain yes blockchains
34:51 - build on node.js i believe
34:54 - interactive animation websites so
34:58 - here's some tech companies using this
35:00 - linkedin we have a facebook i mean
35:02 - pretty much anything that you see on the
35:04 - web is just using javascript ebay tesla
35:06 - coupon netflix google
35:07 - uber paypal abb
35:11 - those are all companies who are using
35:12 - you know javascript
35:14 - okay next one let's see okay web apps
35:18 - for example like web apps like facebook
35:20 - ios and android so actually i have a
35:22 - tesla app right here
35:23 - and this desktop is actually built with
35:26 - react native
35:27 - it's on your iphone but it's built with
35:30 - react native which i think is so cool
35:32 - right then we have server apps which are
35:35 - netflix apps so for example who knows
35:37 - what a server app is
35:38 - anyone know what a server app is what's
35:40 - a server app compared to computer like
35:42 - for example i was an android app
35:45 - a server app what is it what is the
35:46 - server app jesse
35:49 - or nevermind so a server app and then
35:53 - sorry i was checking the chat i'm sorry
35:54 - oh good i'm good so a server app for
35:56 - example is for example if you were to
35:57 - use node.js okay
35:59 - let me go ahead and make sure this
36:00 - node.js okay
36:03 - so this is a framework with javascript
36:06 - and so this is all the behind the scenes
36:08 - stuff that's going on
36:10 - you know behind netflix so we have the
36:12 - front of netflix
36:13 - which i believe is actually built with
36:15 - react gs the front of netflix
36:17 - right it's actually blue with build with
36:19 - react gs but the back end of netflix is
36:21 - built with no gs
36:23 - this is where all the database is stored
36:25 - right this is where all the logic
36:27 - when you log in log out that is
36:30 - where all of that is happening right
36:32 - this because server app is taught
36:34 - basically the front end is talking to
36:35 - the server app and the server app then
36:37 - is talking to
36:38 - the front end all the time right and
36:40 - that is of course built with javascript
36:42 - the myths of becoming a developer right
36:45 - do i need to have a degree to get a job
36:47 - as a developer what do you guys think
36:50 - what do you guys think what do you say
36:52 - no no
36:54 - no no no no no no no that's right
36:58 - no no no no no
37:06 - hello
37:09 - why are you playing cricket i don't know
37:12 - because it's a no
37:16 - so no you do not need to have a degree
37:18 - to get a job most of my
37:21 - friends who are developers do not have
37:23 - any degrees
37:24 - they just they got the job because
37:26 - they're just good
37:27 - if you're good at what you do that's all
37:29 - that matters that's right
37:30 - honestly that's it okay so this is what
37:33 - we talked about
37:34 - if for example we have um google right
37:37 - so google for example
37:39 - do i need a computer science is good to
37:40 - have a google software engineer no a cs
37:42 - degree is not required
37:44 - for most of our software engineer or
37:46 - product manager roles it says it right
37:48 - there
37:48 - that's from google okay this is a this
37:51 - is from reddit it says i'm self-taught
37:53 - no degree whatsoever i didn't have a
37:55 - problem lending a job in microsoft
37:57 - regardless
37:58 - with a few years of mostly plus plus
37:59 - experience under my belt
38:01 - would wouldn't even say it was hard and
38:03 - no one at work
38:05 - had asked me if i have a degree ever
38:07 - since the first that first interview now
38:09 - that's nothing technically speaking oh
38:11 - you know
38:12 - but for what it's worth i've had
38:13 - recruiters from google
38:15 - facebook amazon try to learn me over as
38:17 - well so like i said just it's possible
38:20 - so this is what we say for
38:21 - certifications we don't like these
38:25 - okay let me ask you this did anybody
38:27 - come here for a certification
38:30 - did you guys come here for a certificate
38:33 - i hope not because you're not getting
38:34 - one where i hate them
38:36 - that's right you're not getting a
38:37 - certificate certificate okay nobody
38:39 - needs a certificate
38:40 - okay nobody needs a certificate here
38:42 - that's right i came for the challenge
38:44 - you came here for what why did you come
38:46 - here
38:47 - give me a reason why did you come here
38:50 - guys
38:51 - why expand my brain to learn something
38:56 - to learn gain knowledge you have friends
38:59 - to build
39:00 - projects that's amazing guys learn learn
39:03 - learn
39:03 - that's right yes right your powerful
39:06 - thing guys
39:06 - you have yes he's autographed
39:10 - maybe you should come to the in-person
39:11 - event to do that
39:14 - so to gain knowledge guys
39:17 - this is why you're here for knowledge it
39:20 - is the most important thing this
39:22 - knowledge is we like to call it very
39:25 - simple
39:26 - knowledge is power
39:31 - no nas it's not yes it is
39:34 - no it's not okay what is jesse i'm sorry
39:37 - okay what is it jesse then
39:39 - applied knowledge is powerful dang
39:42 - let's go jesse okay okay jesse's hidden
39:45 - okay let's go i acknowledge his power
39:47 - because this is the thing guys
39:49 - often we learned in school or maybe your
39:51 - parents used to say this knowledge is
39:53 - power okay so you start reading a lot of
39:55 - books you start watching a lot of
39:56 - documentaries or anything however if you
40:00 - only read the books
40:02 - but you don't apply the theory of the
40:04 - knowledge of that book
40:06 - on your own projects or on your life
40:09 - guess what nothing changes doesn't
40:12 - nothing happens
40:12 - doesn't matter so that's not the real
40:14 - power knowledge is not
40:16 - power applied knowledge is power
40:19 - who here let me ask this who here
40:22 - has learned something new learn
40:24 - something new
40:26 - okay and have wanted to get into
40:28 - something maybe you've wanted to get
40:29 - into coding
40:31 - but you've never actually done it
40:34 - you've read the books you've started
40:36 - maybe if you're watching a video
40:37 - but you never actually did it
40:42 - a lot i know a lot of people
40:45 - that's right why why why
40:48 - because you can learn all you want but
40:51 - unless
40:52 - you actually apply it to the real world
40:54 - it does not
40:56 - matter whatever you learn
40:59 - here in this let me tell you this the
41:02 - unfortunate truth is the following
41:06 - fifty percent of you here in this
41:07 - challenge
41:09 - are going to watch it and then that's
41:11 - the only thing you're gonna do
41:14 - [Music]
41:16 - fifty percent of you are going to do
41:17 - that and that's a very unfortunate
41:20 - truth but that's just real world
41:24 - the other 50 are actually going to apply
41:27 - what they've learned
41:28 - they're going to take the knowledge they
41:30 - have here they're going to do something
41:32 - about it or they're going to take it to
41:33 - the next
41:34 - level maybe they'll use what they
41:35 - learned here and maybe the next thing
41:37 - you know maybe they'll maybe get some
41:40 - more training and
41:41 - they keep going at it they keep doing
41:43 - the same thing they keep learning more
41:44 - things
41:45 - other people will just be like oh great
41:47 - i did this that's it that's all i need
41:50 - so let me ask you this are you the other
41:53 - 50
41:54 - are you the 50 that's going to be just
41:56 - using this
41:57 - and that's it and you're done are you
41:59 - the 50
42:00 - that's you know what no i'm gonna take
42:02 - what i learned from here and then i'm
42:04 - gonna take it to the next
42:05 - step which one are you
42:10 - which one are you let me ask you that
42:11 - i'm gonna take it and build on it
42:13 - awesome jason
42:15 - that's right that's right i'm really
42:16 - serious about this because
42:18 - i talk to a lot of students and ver the
42:21 - unfortunate truth is
42:22 - they say oh no as you know i'm not ready
42:24 - for this right now i'm not ready
42:26 - for you know maybe a coding course or
42:29 - even a boot camp i'm not ready for
42:32 - to learn anything to you know that's
42:33 - that's outside my league
42:35 - well you know basically what what you're
42:37 - saying if you're saying that
42:39 - you're saying what that means let's say
42:40 - you're not serious about what you're
42:41 - trying to do
42:43 - it also means you're not ready to change
42:46 - your life
42:49 - even though you should be changing it
42:51 - maybe at that point because
42:52 - otherwise why would you be here
42:55 - wanting to learn something that's right
42:58 - that's right
42:58 - somebody said not ready is delaying
43:00 - forever
43:02 - have you ever thought to yourself hey
43:04 - you know what oh yeah i'll do this later
43:06 - oh yeah i'll do this later i'll do it
43:07 - later later and then later just never
43:09 - becomes the truth never becomes forever
43:12 - raise your hand if you've done that i've
43:13 - done it too i've done it too
43:15 - yeah i've done it everybody's done it
43:17 - yeah guilty of charge me too
43:21 - the thing is though guys you know what
43:22 - procrastination actually is
43:27 - procrastination is not about you not
43:29 - being ready
43:31 - you not being motivated enough you not
43:33 - having the money or you not having the
43:35 - will or the power or the sleep or the
43:37 - energy or whatsoever that's not what
43:38 - procrastination
43:39 - is procrastination is actually a coping
43:43 - mechanism
43:44 - that comes in when we're dealing with
43:47 - stress
43:49 - guess what changing your life yes can be
43:51 - [ __ ] stressful guess what
43:54 - it's also worth it so
43:57 - once i noticed for myself for example
43:59 - that i used to procrastinate on stuff
44:02 - i knew like okay i should not
44:03 - procrastinate on it
44:05 - i have to step into the fear and do it
44:07 - immediately and this is the moment right
44:09 - like who's that guy marcus aurelius says
44:12 - it right
44:13 - fear is often about 99 scenarios you
44:16 - have in your head
44:17 - but none of them is actually true
44:20 - right so once you realize that and once
44:22 - you practice that guys and once you
44:24 - you know be comfortable with being
44:28 - uncomfortable
44:29 - and going into that step going into that
44:31 - fear that's when you will change your
44:32 - life
44:33 - but you gotta go move forward okay
44:36 - somebody said it's a
44:37 - daunting talk to get your [ __ ] together
44:39 - basically that's it
44:41 - that's worth it that's it so
44:44 - that's what i like to say you know for
44:46 - me a lot of times and
44:48 - sometimes yes it is hard sometimes yes
44:50 - it is can be difficult and it's scary
44:52 - but what isn't scary what isn't scary
44:56 - anything that it's new is going to be
44:58 - fearful is going to be scary
45:00 - it's going to be something on the
45:02 - unknown we as human beings we are driven
45:04 - by a few things
45:06 - right here the few things we are driven
45:08 - by we are driven by
45:10 - what we are driven by uh when we have
45:13 - uh safety
45:17 - right we are driven by when we have
45:20 - uh not not direction but we are driven
45:22 - by
45:24 - um not competence what isn't when we're
45:28 - consistency
45:31 - we like consistency don't don't we we
45:33 - like consistency
45:35 - right but we are also driven by
45:38 - differentiation we're driven by new
45:40 - things
45:42 - growth and
45:46 - your brain by default is there
45:49 - for this your brain by default is to
45:51 - keep you safe
45:53 - and to keep you doing consistent things
45:55 - that's what your brain is there for
45:57 - anything outside that creates fear is
46:00 - the reason why
46:01 - is because your brain is telling you no
46:03 - it is not safe
46:04 - it is something new it is not consistent
46:07 - we haven't done this before
46:09 - so no no let's go ahead and
46:12 - scream and let's uh be scared
46:16 - that's what happens that's just the
46:19 - truth
46:21 - but the truth is this is what's stopping
46:24 - a lot of us
46:26 - this is what stopped me i'm guessing it
46:28 - was was
46:29 - maybe stopped jesse at some point too
46:35 - maybe not i don't know jesse but it
46:36 - stopped me at some point
46:38 - okay i'm not perfect
46:42 - okay but i mean of course everybody has
46:44 - been there you know
46:45 - um because that's the thing guys when
46:48 - you do something
46:51 - that changes your life or that is a
46:53 - little bit scary maybe
46:55 - even not changing your life but just a
46:57 - little bit you know
46:58 - um what not says right the little voice
47:02 - comes in
47:03 - and the little voice tells you no
47:05 - actually
47:06 - don't become a software developer
47:08 - because you're earning more money now at
47:09 - the job that you're at now
47:11 - even though you don't like it you're
47:14 - earning more money and if you become a
47:15 - software developer again you have to
47:16 - start from scratch
47:17 - you have to invest a lot of energy in it
47:19 - a lot of money yeah you know you should
47:21 - just stay where you are
47:22 - yeah yeah but there's this other voice
47:26 - in your head and that goes off like
47:28 - but i'm not happy at my current job i
47:31 - think i could be happier
47:33 - i love code i actually love creating
47:35 - things
47:36 - i don't see why i cannot do this and
47:38 - then the fight starts
47:40 - that's right you know and that's you
47:42 - struggling and getting over that
47:44 - wall to get outside of your comfort zone
47:48 - yeah some of the scariest things for me
47:50 - were for example quitting my job
47:52 - you know the scariest thing for me was
47:54 - talking in front of a lot of people
47:56 - the scariest thing for me heck even
47:58 - asking a girl on a date for me was scary
48:00 - right
48:01 - but it had to be done you know
48:04 - but it had to be done right but
48:07 - through all that that's where the result
48:09 - comes around
48:12 - right that's where the result comes
48:13 - around when you for example anything new
48:15 - when you go into college or maybe when
48:16 - you go
48:17 - learning a new piece of technology maybe
48:19 - you're learning how to ride a bicycle
48:21 - it's going to be scary and there's a
48:23 - reason for it okay
48:24 - but that is okay and i want
48:28 - all of you to understand that what i
48:31 - like to do is instead of being scared
48:32 - you know what
48:33 - that's fearful in my mind i'm like you
48:35 - know what
48:36 - no i'm going to go into it if it's fear
48:40 - that i fear
48:41 - i actually do the opposite i paired it
48:42 - up i make the assumption the following
48:45 - if it's fearful i do it
48:48 - and so if you just keep doing it
48:51 - fear equals do
48:55 - i mean don't do it don't do anything
48:57 - crazy stupid okay don't just go jumping
48:58 - you know or something
48:59 - just let's also
49:04 - when you come here you're going to go
49:06 - skydiving with us 100 by the way
49:11 - okay but fear equals do i start to pair
49:14 - that in my life with fair equals do
49:17 - my parents for example at 35 years old
49:20 - they completely changed their life they
49:22 - stopped everything they had in ukraine
49:24 - and they came to america
49:28 - imagine restarting your life from zero
49:30 - they came to america with five hundred
49:31 - dollars guys
49:32 - and they're in cash that's it that's all
49:34 - they had they sold everything they had
49:36 - in ukraine they saw everything they had
49:39 - in ukraine
49:40 - and they came here
49:43 - how's that right and they literally came
49:46 - here to a country where they did not
49:47 - know the language they did not know
49:50 - anything
49:50 - my dad was working 18 hours a day
49:52 - cleaning clean cars at a car wash
49:55 - my mom was cleaning houses that's the
49:56 - only job they could get at that point
50:01 - but because of them it is the reason why
50:03 - i am here
50:05 - the reason why i now have a sister
50:09 - right it is the reason why now i can
50:11 - teach you it is a reason why
50:13 - you know i've been able to learn so much
50:14 - and become a developer and become a
50:16 - great developer hard working person
50:18 - because i've realized that
50:19 - the hard work and fear is just part of
50:21 - the game
50:25 - and now to me and i because of the
50:27 - example that my parents have set for me
50:29 - i have nothing else but you know but to
50:32 - thank them for what they've done because
50:33 - it is not easy to be 35 years old
50:36 - and to restart to hit a restart on your
50:38 - life in a new country
50:41 - though you can't even speak
50:45 - that's right some you said salma that's
50:48 - right my parents came here to give us a
50:49 - better life the reason there's a reason
50:51 - why they do that to give us a better
50:52 - life so
50:53 - for a lot of you here you guys might be
50:56 - here because you want to give your kids
50:58 - or your future a better life
51:01 - raise your hand that's you am i right
51:04 - isn't isn't that a good intention
51:08 - so let's look at so let's make it happen
51:11 - let's just [ __ ] do it because
51:14 - somebody has to go through it somebody
51:16 - has to go through the troubles and
51:17 - tribulations
51:20 - and let that be us and that's fine
51:23 - all right guys are you with me here are
51:25 - you with me
51:27 - are you with me beautiful i love it
51:29 - let's go
51:30 - all right awesome i just got deep that's
51:33 - cool
51:35 - yeah i mean i mean it's how we set the
51:38 - tone also for this challenge guys like
51:40 - are you [ __ ] in or what because
51:43 - actually this challenge of course is
51:45 - about coding
51:45 - of course it's also about fun but it's
51:47 - also about how are you going to take the
51:49 - next step
51:50 - in your life how are you going to make
51:52 - code you know
51:53 - work for you how are you know um
51:56 - i studied law i changed careers and
52:00 - you know it just seemed like a career
52:01 - switch
52:03 - but it was not just about that it was
52:06 - about
52:07 - i want to live my life on my terms i
52:10 - want to create the life that i want to
52:11 - live
52:12 - okay and so that's also why you guys
52:14 - should be in this challenge
52:16 - and feel that you know embrace that
52:18 - power that you have
52:20 - and work for it to gain it basically
52:23 - okay so that's why this is so important
52:25 - to talk about and to
52:27 - overcome the fears that come in the
52:28 - little voices to get out of your comfort
52:30 - zone
52:31 - and i always have i'm not going to talk
52:33 - about this much more but i have one
52:34 - question for you all
52:37 - what's the real prize if
52:41 - you're not going to go into coding
52:43 - what's the real price
52:45 - now a lot of people only think about the
52:47 - money that they're missing out on or
52:50 - you know because they're changing job
52:52 - from a higher salary
52:53 - not wanting you know becoming a software
52:55 - intern but
52:57 - it's about what's the real price and
52:59 - often that's happiness
53:01 - that's health that's creativity that's
53:04 - freedom
53:05 - which is just as valuable as money to
53:08 - some point or even more
53:10 - okay so let's continue i love it i love
53:12 - it that's it and somebody said
53:14 - joseph king said can i learn coding
53:16 - while studying medical school 100
53:18 - yes you can't 100 hell yeah i have a
53:21 - really good combo
53:22 - i have a student right now who is
53:24 - actually working right now
53:25 - as a doctor no she's
53:28 - i forgot doctor no i'm not a doctor
53:32 - in the medical field anyways and she's
53:34 - also she's also in her boot camp and
53:36 - she's
53:37 - literally she has the coaching call like
53:39 - it's not
53:40 - no joke she opens up the cultural on her
53:43 - in the zoom on her phone right she puts
53:47 - an airpods
53:48 - into her uh you know he puts in airpods
53:50 - and then she then she just works
53:53 - and she listens like because that's her
53:55 - job right
53:56 - but but she's doing it she's killing it
53:58 - right so there you go
54:00 - awesome sweet so this is what you know
54:02 - for example this is what
54:04 - uh elon musk even said for example right
54:07 - so
54:07 - you can't successful in life without you
54:09 - can't succeed in life without a degree
54:11 - that's why you need schooling if you
54:12 - want to go to harvard yamas says
54:14 - that's not true don't confuse schooling
54:16 - with education i didn't go to harvard
54:18 - but
54:18 - but the people that work for me did
54:20 - right so like i said it doesn't really
54:21 - matter
54:22 - right same thing elon musk do you still
54:24 - stand firmly on requiring college
54:25 - degrees
54:27 - are not at not requiring character he's
54:30 - like yes
54:31 - right there right so just a few examples
54:33 - so don't do a degree guys that's not the
54:34 - most important thing right
54:36 - if you don't do not have a degree uh
54:38 - salary i'll look
54:39 - we're looking i mean it just keeps going
54:40 - up and up and up and it will keep going
54:43 - up because there's a lot more demand
54:45 - than the supply okay and here's the
54:48 - breakdown again this is for the entry
54:49 - level software engineers
54:51 - for example you know spacex tesla you
54:53 - know crews
54:54 - these are some example companies there's
54:56 - a ton of companies out there you can go
54:57 - and check it out
54:58 - spacex for example you know average sale
55:00 - is around 170 thousand dollars
55:02 - tesla 157k south engineer
55:07 - 216 000 so yeah if you're really good if
55:11 - you're competent in what you do
55:12 - yes these numbers are not crazy honestly
55:15 - like they're not crazy
55:16 - when you are competent at what you do so
55:19 - here's an example i mean cause himself
55:21 - who knows kazi raise a man raise your
55:23 - hands who knows cause he here you guys
55:24 - know kazi right and you guys know cozy
55:27 - that's right he himself has dropped out
55:29 - of college he himself did not go to
55:32 - college
55:32 - and he just instead decided to learn by
55:34 - himself do freelancing and then
55:37 - build a business like clever programmer
55:38 - here right and teach everybody else
55:41 - so that's just one example another
55:43 - example look at this look at this who's
55:45 - this
55:45 - anybody know this girl i don't know this
55:47 - girl who knows this girl
55:49 - anybody hope you guys do but this is
55:51 - jesse
55:52 - this is me um studied law in amsterdam
55:56 - okay um actually i studied law because i
55:58 - didn't know what i wanted to become well
56:02 - there you go
56:03 - so um working a few years as a text law
56:06 - consultant okay and then i realized at
56:09 - my first job
56:10 - they asked me to survey a tax newsletter
56:14 - and guess what i had to program that
56:18 - newsletter
56:18 - in the html css that's right that's
56:22 - right that's right that's where i fell
56:23 - in love with code
56:25 - realizing i love that part of my job but
56:28 - i hated the [ __ ] rest
56:30 - loves code there we go there we go
56:33 - that's all she needed
56:34 - she just loves to cook and now she's a
56:36 - geeky and a nerdy coder there you go
56:39 - and that is okay i was always a dirty
56:43 - i was born to be a coder um so
56:46 - yeah so you know um after that um
56:50 - going to meetups uh learning code on my
56:52 - own
56:53 - um never you know but having a hard time
56:55 - finding
56:56 - communities in that time you know most
56:59 - of it was online
57:00 - um so of course free code camp
57:04 - or code academy or tutorials but that
57:07 - didn't get me
57:09 - any further um
57:12 - long story short um i just tried some
57:15 - things out
57:16 - and i landed an internship and i did it
57:19 - on my on my own
57:20 - you know so yeah basically i think that
57:24 - muscle makes me
57:25 - a strong teacher actually because i
57:28 - learned it from scratch i learned it the
57:29 - hard way the soft way
57:31 - the medium way whatever way um
57:34 - you guys wherever you failed i feel too
57:36 - and i got back up
57:38 - okay so i think that makes me a good
57:40 - teacher in the sense of
57:42 - uh i know what it takes um to learn code
57:45 - from scratch
57:46 - um and how you can learn it better and
57:47 - faster and
57:49 - uh make it work for you that's okay
57:51 - that's right that's right but the most
57:52 - important part guys and when all of this
57:54 - is mindset you know being a good
57:55 - developer is about being a good
57:56 - communicator
57:57 - and having the right mindset okay so so
58:00 - let's keep on i have another example
58:02 - here robert he is a friend of mine
58:04 - great guy okay look at how good he looks
58:06 - so
58:07 - so robert right has an agree he's a good
58:10 - friend of mine
58:10 - and i actually work with him on trindala
58:12 - it's a startup company that he did with
58:14 - one of my another friend steve
58:16 - um i use them as an always example they
58:18 - were amazing mentors of mine he was a
58:19 - mentor of mine
58:20 - so will steve i love both of them and i
58:22 - still keep in touch with them to this
58:23 - day
58:24 - um yeah we both were doing this startup
58:26 - company turned out we were all doing
58:27 - this
58:28 - and you know he didn't have a degree he
58:30 - just kind of started this right and now
58:31 - he works at quicken loss which
58:32 - one of the biggest company look at this
58:34 - he's a team lead he's
58:36 - he's a team lead guys like he's a leader
58:38 - he's a senior
58:39 - developer who's a leader in his whole
58:41 - team at
58:42 - quicken loans and he has he's leading
58:44 - people who are you know
58:46 - a lot older than him and who even have
58:48 - degrees who have
58:49 - master's degrees doesn't matter he
58:53 - is just hard worker and he just
58:57 - loves what he does that's it period
59:01 - okay so the career ladder kind of looks
59:04 - like this
59:05 - you know you start with a junior
59:06 - developer in your position
59:08 - you start off with this amanda actually
59:10 - before this you might actually start up
59:11 - with an internship
59:12 - at first
59:15 - that might be the first thing you start
59:16 - so an internship might start out then
59:18 - you go into a senior developer position
59:20 - then go into a lead developer position a
59:23 - technical architect potentially
59:24 - a team lead which is think about that
59:27 - right
59:28 - he now is a team lead he is here now
59:32 - already wow and he's my age he's my age
59:35 - guys
59:37 - he's 25 25 years old that's right and

72:30 - unfortunate truth that a lot of people
72:32 - don't tell you
72:34 - you think that you need to build crazy
72:36 - products here's what you think
72:38 - you think that in order to get to this
72:40 - you need to do the following you need to
72:41 - do
72:42 - build crazy project
72:47 - you need to really just say you're there
72:49 - yeah okay
72:50 - i am here okay good build crazy projects
72:53 - you're building crazy products you need
72:54 - to for example
72:56 - learn a bunch of technologies
72:59 - a bunch of technologies
73:02 - like you need to learn so many
73:04 - technologies right you need to learn all
73:06 - these technologies right
73:08 - you need to you know you need to maybe
73:10 - you know um
73:11 - let me see let's see you need to learn
73:13 - node.js and you need to know react to
73:15 - yes and you need to know
73:17 - all these different you know like
73:19 - frameworks and
73:21 - angularjs and let me cut all that
73:23 - [ __ ] out from you
73:26 - okay let me just say this very simple
73:29 - just cross this out i know i know it's
73:31 - crazy i just crossed out for you
73:34 - because this is the reason why you're
73:36 - not an actual developer
73:38 - period you think that you just need to
73:41 - keep doing more youtube
73:44 - you think that you need to keep doing
73:45 - more udemy courses
73:48 - you think you just need to keep doing
73:50 - more and more and more and more and more
73:51 - of the stuff that does not [ __ ] work
73:55 - oh are we stuck where we where i think
73:58 - we're stuck
73:59 - at if you're doing the same thing of the
74:01 - thing that doesn't work
74:03 - then you're just doing the same thing it
74:04 - doesn't work it doesn't change
74:08 - yes deborah said it tutorial hell
74:11 - that's right you my friends are in
74:13 - tutorial help but it's not just that
74:14 - you're in the hell
74:16 - in general okay
74:19 - that's right because you yourself if i
74:22 - just give you is very simple problem
74:24 - right now and i said to you hey you know
74:26 - what
74:26 - create for me a function that will merge
74:28 - to a race together
74:30 - could you do that right now or hey can
74:33 - you for example build a binary search
74:34 - tree or can you for example
74:37 - just even build a project from scratch
74:41 - can you do that right now like i build a
74:42 - car before yourself by now
74:44 - some of you you have that knowledge and
74:46 - maybe yes you can
74:47 - because you've done that before but some
74:51 - of you you're like oh hell no i know
74:52 - what you're talking about
74:54 - that's right reason being is because
74:56 - what you guys don't have unfortunately
74:58 - is the following
74:59 - is this the fundamentals it's like for
75:02 - example if i told you to build a house
75:04 - what is the first thing that you build
75:06 - when you build a house
75:07 - what is it it's what is the foundation
75:12 - and yes it's the foundation of the house
75:15 - if you've got no foundation whatever
75:17 - happens
75:20 - your house will collapse by about your
75:23 - house will collapse
75:27 - right so i take this very seriously i
75:29 - take this problem only very very
75:31 - seriously right
75:33 - and some of you for example and here's
75:34 - what you told maybe hey you know what
75:36 - you need to learn html you need to learn
75:38 - css
75:39 - and uh you know this is so important and
75:42 - all this stuff and yeah html css yeah
75:46 - that will make your developer
75:48 - uh-huh uh-huh yeah this is what's
75:50 - important right here
75:51 - uh-huh learn this spend two months
75:54 - learning this
75:55 - okay hell no
76:00 - as well also cross this [ __ ] out
76:05 - you don't need none of that okay let me
76:07 - tell you that
76:08 - i don't know what kind of voice that was
76:10 - that was really interesting that was the
76:11 - first time i did that before
76:15 - now is you okay sometimes
76:18 - i don't know maybe it's a movie that i i
76:22 - heard or something right
76:24 - but you don't need that guys this my
76:27 - friends
76:27 - is not a programming language it is not
76:30 - i can teach you html css
76:32 - in literally two days i can teach you
76:34 - guys a whole html css
76:37 - and i'm not kidding in probably three
76:39 - days over you
76:40 - actually being a challenge and if i
76:42 - focus focus only on html css
76:44 - that's what you will learn your best way
76:47 - to learn html
76:48 - css is just for practice and nobody
76:52 - have you ever seen on the actual for
76:55 - example
76:56 - on an in not an interview but for one
76:58 - have you ever seen anybody ask an
77:00 - interview about html css
77:03 - maybe there's like one or two people
77:06 - nope
77:07 - no hell no no have you ever heard
77:10 - anybody tell you hey you know what
77:11 - you need to learn to miss success and uh
77:14 - yeah you're gonna be asked about ishmael
77:15 - css uh
77:17 - as a requirement for a job a job
77:20 - requirement
77:20 - yeah yeah so important yeah
77:24 - that's right learn that right now no
77:27 - never i never had that
77:32 - maybe some of you have done it maybe
77:34 - you've seen it right it's i want to say
77:36 - never ever
77:36 - that doesn't make sense right never
77:38 - never that doesn't happen right
77:41 - but they don't focus on that
77:44 - what you need to what they are asking
77:46 - you is hey how can you actually
77:48 - problem solve and problem solving comes
77:52 - from what solving problems
77:56 - that's right that's right all this stuff
77:59 - is unnecessary
78:02 - boom it's very simple how can you
78:06 - problem
78:10 - solve it is very simple
78:13 - and problem solving comes with knowing
78:16 - these fundamentals
78:17 - it is comes from experience it comes
78:19 - from you practicing
78:21 - non-stop that's where that comes from
78:23 - okay guys
78:25 - so i want you guys to be very serious
78:26 - about this you guys have taken courses
78:28 - of html of css and i know a lot of you
78:31 - are there
78:33 - and let me tell you you don't need that
78:36 - let me save you your time and your money
78:39 - okay
78:40 - so what you need to know actually the
78:41 - fundamentals first right because if i
78:43 - ask you interview questions like
78:45 - around uh foundations around algorithms
78:48 - or on data structures
78:49 - it comes from you know how to promote it
78:51 - comes from you know the fundamentals of
78:53 - actually coding
78:54 - that's it right so here's what you guys
78:56 - to do okay number one
78:58 - take out a piece of paper and a pen
79:00 - right now
79:01 - i'll be every single person right now
79:04 - okay
79:05 - take out a piece of paper and a pen
79:07 - right now
79:10 - i want you to write down the following
79:14 - or to write down that i want you to
79:16 - write down one
79:18 - one let me say this right now let me say
79:21 - this right now
79:22 - one write down i need to learn the
79:25 - fundamentals
79:30 - learn fundamentals
79:38 - right two
79:42 - i need to create projects on my own
79:46 - what does that mean you don't look at
79:48 - anybody else you don't
79:50 - look at youtube you don't look at you
79:51 - dummy no you create
79:56 - projects on your own
80:00 - on your own you figure out a good
80:03 - project
80:04 - you want to do you figure an idea and
80:05 - then you just do it
80:08 - okay it's sometimes things are as simple
80:11 - as just
80:11 - you just doing it that's it
80:14 - you can't escape it
80:18 - that's an unfortunate truth what
80:21 - what type of products to start out with
80:24 - what depends on what technology you know
80:26 - if you know javascript and you know html
80:28 - and css
80:29 - build a website build a website for
80:32 - example
80:33 - for maybe a company that you love build
80:36 - a website for maybe
80:37 - a specific restaurant
80:44 - that's right right anything
80:48 - that's right so fake it a good project
80:51 - there's actually some amazing products
80:52 - you can guess
80:53 - guys can take a look at i want you guys
80:55 - to take a look at a company called
80:56 - front-end mentor
80:59 - okay everybody right now i want you guys
81:01 - to check out a comical front end
81:03 - front front end mentor
81:07 - these guys these guys will show you
81:09 - projects to do
81:11 - okay go to their website that's right
81:14 - go to that website go to google.com type
81:17 - in front-end mentor
81:19 - and then you'll see all the projects
81:20 - that you can build
81:22 - they literally have the designs for you
81:24 - all you have to do is just build them
81:26 - and you build them and you have fun with
81:28 - it that's it guys
81:30 - simple as that okay and of course you
81:32 - make a plan so
81:33 - your plan should be the following one
81:36 - learn the fundamentals
81:37 - of javascript so look learn all the
81:40 - fundamentals around
81:41 - algorithms data structures right for
81:43 - example like things like
81:44 - what are some fundamentals that need to
81:46 - know jesse who do you know
81:49 - in order to start wealth with front-end
81:51 - mentor no
81:52 - for the mentors in general they need to
81:54 - learn no things like stacks
81:57 - right oh you mean data structures that's
82:00 - right stacks
82:02 - uh binary search trees um linked list of
82:05 - course
82:06 - queues um tries and
82:10 - maybe hash table or graphs but that's
82:12 - very advanced yeah i would say
82:14 - arrays just objects in general
82:18 - yeah okay i know for some of you it's
82:20 - like oh you know
82:21 - this stuff is not fun this stuff you
82:22 - don't actually need we're never going to
82:24 - use this in actual you know
82:26 - in in actual uh in real life you're
82:28 - right you're not
82:30 - like this kind of stuff you're not
82:31 - actually going to use unless you're
82:32 - doing really complicated stuff
82:34 - but what this stuff builds and this is
82:36 - actually crazy enough i realized this
82:38 - when i became a teacher
82:40 - i realized that the way the reason why i
82:41 - became such a good developer
82:43 - is because i know this stuff
82:46 - all this stuff that's the reason and i
82:49 - initially i was like oh that's a bunch
82:50 - of [ __ ]
82:51 - screw that nobody needs to learn this
82:53 - i'm never going to use this in real
82:54 - world and you're right you're not
82:56 - but this builds neurons
83:01 - a this kind of stuff makes you a good
83:04 - problem
83:05 - solver yes because you're always
83:08 - thinking you're always thinking okay how
83:11 - can i do this
83:12 - how can i do that how can i do this how
83:15 - can i use all these
83:16 - little tools that i have in my own tool
83:18 - belt
83:20 - to solve a problem and these are just
83:24 - simply the tools
83:28 - these are just the tools so i want you
83:32 - to be very careful that
83:33 - the reason why you learn this kind of
83:34 - stuff not because you're going to use it
83:37 - but it's because it's going to make it a
83:38 - better problem solver that's it
83:40 - honestly that is it
83:43 - that's the reason why i'm going to we're
83:45 - going to we're so focused on that
83:48 - so another really cool thing that we
83:50 - like to use is something called notion
83:51 - notion is a great company that we like
83:53 - to use as well
83:54 - for you know um for uh scheduling things
83:57 - or
83:58 - for creating tasks lists so go and check
84:00 - them out
84:01 - okay so sound important habits for you
84:03 - too for you to get there
84:05 - we i talk about this really simple it is
84:08 - really easy not easy but here's what i
84:10 - say fun
84:12 - i prioritize this a lot don't put if
84:14 - it's if you're tired
84:16 - uh you know at night and you feel like
84:18 - you don't want to code and
84:20 - maybe you just like you just just feel
84:22 - like you despise it later on
84:24 - then just don't code just don't worry
84:25 - about it instead
84:27 - figure out what's fun for you like let
84:29 - me ask you this
84:30 - like what in what way can you work
84:33 - that's fun
84:34 - put in the chat i know my way ways that
84:37 - i like to work that's fun like in what
84:38 - ways is your fun for you
84:41 - what what's the fun just i know those
84:43 - ways yeah you know those days
84:45 - for example somebody said music playing
84:48 - music
84:49 - playing music dancing while coding
84:52 - um i like to draw draw things out
84:56 - improve ideas um
84:59 - think of new features use pinterest
85:02 - or dribble um
85:05 - yeah well sometimes i watch twitch
85:10 - somebody said by making money somebody
85:12 - say cook
85:13 - watch twitch anime yeah for sure of
85:15 - course that's fun yeah
85:17 - so for example from me and again you
85:19 - will learn this
85:21 - you will learn this as you get better
85:23 - okay
85:24 - for me for example the way i like to
85:26 - work in a fun way
85:27 - is i actually like to go to coffee shops
85:30 - i don't drink coffee
85:32 - but i go to coffee shops so for example
85:36 - really cool for me is i like the
85:37 - environment i like to set myself a
85:39 - really good environment
85:40 - right so just going to coffee shops in
85:42 - general well there's a lot of people
85:43 - doing other stuff
85:45 - you know they're all maybe working you
85:46 - know by themselves you know they got
85:48 - this coffee it's like
85:49 - it's like this whole process you go to a
85:51 - coffee shop you know you
85:53 - get a coffee maybe you get a chai latte
85:55 - i like chai latte that's what i like
85:57 - because i don't
85:57 - i don't drink coffee so i'm gonna try i
86:00 - know
86:01 - i gotta try latte maybe give myself like
86:03 - a little cookie
86:04 - you know just to you know make myself
86:06 - feel good you know
86:08 - sometimes give myself a small sandwich
86:10 - they got there you know so good
86:12 - and i just take that and i go to i go to
86:15 - sit down
86:16 - i open my laptop i put on my headphones
86:18 - and i just
86:19 - work i just have fun honestly and i
86:22 - enjoy that
86:23 - i enjoy the crap out of that and that to
86:26 - me is fun so
86:27 - yes i would say prioritize fun because
86:30 - fun
86:31 - is what allows you to keep doing what
86:32 - you're doing fun
86:34 - okay so fun allows you to keep doing of
86:38 - course then we talk about hard work
86:39 - that's really important as well
86:40 - you know patience uh this you know these
86:43 - are some key terms
86:44 - you i'm sure you you know all of you
86:45 - guys know this is you just need to put
86:47 - this into actual perspective and
86:48 - actually use it uh
86:50 - team cooperation communication learning
86:52 - tick initiative
86:53 - very important i think on here is ticket
86:55 - initiative whenever you get the chance
86:57 - to actually work at a company
86:58 - i want you to remember this word take an
87:00 - issue i want you to write this
87:02 - on your piece of paper right now take
87:05 - all right take initiative
87:08 - take initiative all right okay take
87:10 - initiative this is very
87:13 - very very i would say extremely
87:15 - important
87:16 - as a developer also as
87:20 - in becoming a problem solver
87:23 - now i see a lot i talk to a lot of
87:25 - students and i see
87:26 - students behave a certain way often
87:29 - right
87:30 - when they start out and they want to
87:31 - become a problem solver
87:33 - they want to solve that problem however
87:37 - they ask me how do i solve this
87:42 - what's what's wrong here but they're
87:45 - they're
87:46 - that's the only thing they do they only
87:47 - ask me one question
87:50 - instead of you know going to google
87:54 - google it search it search on more
87:58 - ask the right questions write the right
87:59 - questions down get some clarity if they
88:01 - got some answers
88:03 - uh show the steps they've done to solve
88:05 - the problem and then come back to me and
88:07 - say like hey
88:08 - i have this problem this is the goal of
88:10 - my code
88:12 - but i have this problem and i tried this
88:14 - this this to solve it
88:16 - what direction should i go in a or b
88:20 - that's sometimes what i see um
88:23 - a lot of students lacking in they're not
88:26 - taking that initiative
88:28 - they think just asking the question hey
88:30 - my code doesn't work can you help me out
88:31 - they think that's initiative
88:33 - but that's not initiative real
88:35 - initiative is
88:37 - going out there you know trying to get
88:39 - what you want
88:40 - listen you don't have to know the answer
88:44 - but initiative is about making that
88:46 - effort to find out the answer
88:50 - would you rather have if you were a
88:52 - senior would you rather have a junior
88:55 - that just ask you hey my code doesn't
88:57 - work can you help me
88:58 - or would you rather have a junior asking
89:00 - you hey this is the goal of my code
89:02 - it doesn't work i tried this this and
89:04 - that can you help me out with this and
89:06 - that and that
89:07 - a lot better right that's right
89:10 - that's right so that's what taking
89:12 - initiative is about guys that's what
89:14 - that means that's right
89:15 - okay sweet so next up how to learn to
89:18 - code
89:19 - uh well there is how can i not so
89:22 - there's a few different mentalities i'd
89:23 - like to talk about
89:24 - there's the one mentality which is if
89:26 - you ever approach a problem which you
89:27 - guys will like it or not
89:29 - you can either be mad at your computer
89:31 - and just kill it and you know throw it
89:33 - outside the window
89:34 - and say why can i not solve this and be
89:36 - mad at yourself and be mad at the code
89:38 - or and i honestly i've done this before
89:40 - so
89:41 - so you know i can't blame you if you're
89:43 - in this in this and this too
89:45 - but but the verses is you're always
89:47 - thinking thinking about this
89:49 - thinking about how can i solve this
89:51 - right in your mind the question should
89:53 - be
89:54 - you know i prioritize a lot and i've
89:56 - been told this actually a lot where it's
89:58 - like
89:58 - i'm always in the mindset of okay
90:00 - there's a problem
90:01 - how can i solve it how how how i never
90:05 - limit myself thinking that i can't solve
90:07 - something
90:09 - if for example maybe you're in a bad
90:11 - situation right now
90:12 - maybe maybe you're not making money
90:14 - maybe you don't have a job
90:17 - right maybe you're tired and you just
90:19 - don't know what to do
90:21 - but can you get yourself out of that is
90:23 - there has let me ask you this question
90:26 - if you're in a certain position right
90:27 - now where you have a problem
90:30 - has there anyone asked yourself this
90:33 - has there anyone else that's been in the
90:35 - same position and they've
90:36 - solved that problem has anyone else
90:40 - done it maybe you don't know them
90:43 - but has anyone else done it yes
90:47 - am i right yes of course yes
90:51 - so if they did it could you do it too
90:56 - if they are the example
90:59 - could you do it too we have for example
91:01 - the borah says yes
91:02 - i had no job and i got a job
91:06 - not the job i want to but i'm working
91:09 - the board that's right
91:11 - see so you can always give yourself a
91:12 - situation and know sometimes
91:14 - it's really hard sometimes maybe you are
91:16 - just not capable or not able to get out
91:19 - your situation because you know maybe
91:21 - there's certain things limiting you
91:22 - maybe physically you're limited in a
91:24 - certain way
91:27 - but i'm i'm still sure i want you to
91:28 - keep thinking about how can i solve this
91:30 - i never want you to keep in the
91:32 - mindset of like i've given up and i
91:34 - can't do any more that's not a good
91:35 - mindset to have
91:37 - okay all right next up
91:40 - so full stack developer role map okay we
91:43 - know this
91:44 - at this point it involves a few things
91:48 - front end back-end database
91:52 - devops mobile app the one thing i want
91:55 - you guys to focus on are these three
91:59 - database for the backend okay that's
92:01 - what makes a good developer from full
92:03 - stack developer
92:04 - okay so let's just go ahead and make
92:06 - that
92:07 - uh a focus all right next up
92:10 - again these technologies html css
92:12 - javascript that's going to be your
92:14 - front-end technologies like react.js
92:16 - together with firebase okay right here
92:19 - you guys can write this down kind of
92:20 - stuff down okay who knows this kind of
92:22 - stuff
92:23 - html css in javascript
92:26 - i always think this gives you is so much
92:28 - fun because it really explains actually
92:31 - um these languages you know or these
92:33 - frameworks i'm going to be this guy okay
92:35 - i'm going to be
92:36 - a javascript so i got you you're
92:37 - definitely that guy but then like
92:40 - then like two times faster like forward
92:46 - i don't i don't know how he does it he
92:47 - just like goes nuts he's just like yeah
92:48 - left
92:49 - right why can't he do that
92:52 - he does a little bit of cramping and
92:54 - then a little bit of boogie
92:56 - you know like yeah i got the most can i
92:59 - learn from him i like this i like this
93:00 - person
93:01 - [Music]
93:03 - anyways so of course the three main
93:06 - things
93:06 - html css javascript html what do you
93:09 - think
93:10 - what do you guys think that is that is
93:12 - the skeleton
93:13 - so if you're a person your skeleton is
93:15 - your structure it is your html okay
93:18 - so let's remember that okay your css is
93:21 - your presentation
93:22 - who here likes to dress up when i say
93:25 - dress up just look
93:27 - good okay who here let me know in the
93:30 - chat and it's okay because i like to
93:31 - i like to yeah i like to do it too hell
93:34 - yeah
93:34 - i like to got some nice shoes i got a
93:36 - nice jacket you know
93:38 - got some nice pants you know there we go
93:42 - i like doing that i don't care some
93:44 - people say it's
93:46 - my ego no it's not i just like it okay
93:48 - but anyways
93:49 - that's your css okay that's right
93:53 - that's your appearance okay then we got
93:55 - the javascript
93:56 - okay who here likes to take action
93:59 - who here likes to move who here just i
94:02 - mean if you're in general if you can
94:03 - just move your hands you're good
94:04 - or anything anybody right who here right
94:07 - i'm me i like to dance
94:08 - right anybody here likes to dance or
94:10 - anybody here likes to move around
94:12 - yeah me okay don't say that julian
94:15 - just dance that's right that's right
94:19 - that's the javascript portion of you
94:20 - okay the javascript it is your mind
94:23 - it is what makes you move the way you
94:25 - move right your mind tells you you know
94:27 - what step next step this step this
94:34 - [Music]
94:39 - that's right by the way guys if nas and
94:42 - i if we're having our coding sessions it
94:44 - often goes this way we play music and
94:46 - we're coding and dancing at the same
94:48 - time that's right that's
94:49 - that's how it always goes so uh with
94:52 - html what would like to talk about is of
94:54 - course
94:54 - learn the basics don't focus too much on
94:56 - the html it's amazing
94:58 - uh thing i want you to understand is
95:01 - this is not your main focus your main
95:03 - focus is going to be javascript which
95:04 - we'll talk about here in a second
95:06 - but with html make a page make it work
95:08 - don't over complicate it
95:09 - it's simple guys honestly you learn how
95:12 - to
95:12 - how to use a div h1 a p tag and that's
95:15 - [ __ ] it
95:16 - okay and then you learn some css
95:18 - literally please do not over complicate
95:21 - it if you are right now spending
95:22 - [ __ ] months on learning html css
95:24 - you're in the wrong position period
95:25 - all right okay so here's some basic
95:28 - things literally if i taught you this
95:30 - that's all you got to learn okay
95:33 - html header your body your body is
95:36 - basically this is what you actually see
95:38 - it has things like h1 tags so each one
95:40 - tags are headers
95:41 - okay so it's in my first web page that's
95:43 - going to be a header
95:44 - and p this is your paragraph tag and
95:46 - everything and then there's something
95:47 - called div
95:48 - which you don't see on here but it's
95:50 - like um it kind of looks like this let
95:51 - me show you
95:54 - yeah right here
95:57 - right here and these are building blocks
96:00 - that make everything
96:01 - inside your html work pretty much
96:04 - okay then we've got css again you know
96:06 - focus
96:07 - don't focus too much on that one as well
96:09 - learn how to use different layouts so
96:11 - for example like flexbox
96:13 - in this case we're going to learn how to
96:14 - use tail and css that's
96:16 - using flexbox as well so we'll learn how
96:18 - to do that in this session and not this
96:20 - session but in the next few days
96:22 - okay so guys it is prerequisite
96:25 - that you have some basic knowledge of
96:27 - css otherwise it's going to be really
96:29 - hard to follow along for the next few
96:31 - days
96:32 - so if you have some knowledge on css
96:34 - you're good to go honestly
96:36 - even if you don't it's okay okay because
96:38 - yeah no it's okay completely
96:40 - because uh for you guys if you don't
96:42 - know css that is all right
96:44 - basically you will be seeing the way we
96:47 - are doing this and then this will be
96:48 - sprinkling basically
96:50 - knowledge into you so it's kind of like
96:52 - i'm putting a seed into your brain uh
96:53 - like it's being exposed to it that's
96:55 - right you've been exposed to it that's
96:56 - the whole point of this
96:57 - you're being exposed to new technologies
96:59 - telling css
97:00 - html css javascript so do i need to know
97:03 - javascript no you don't
97:05 - no you don't okay you will be learning a
97:07 - lot of this kind of stuff on here
97:09 - and this will be a seed that will spread
97:12 - out and turn into a beautiful butterfly
97:14 - not a butterfly seeds don't butterflies
97:16 - don't go from seeds um
97:17 - that will turn into a beautiful flower
97:20 - or a tree
97:21 - okay that's what seeds are for okay
97:25 - one of my amazing teachers victoria she
97:27 - was a teacher of mine
97:28 - this teacher she always told me you know
97:29 - what does i'm just planting seeds in you
97:32 - and then what then you become a good
97:34 - dancer that's it
97:37 - and so that's what i like to do to my
97:39 - students as well
97:40 - so again this is some css examples i
97:43 - want to show to you guys
97:44 - so again if you do not know uh nate
97:48 - if you do not know html as well doesn't
97:50 - matter
97:51 - this is for complete beginners you will
97:53 - be all good guys okay it is for complete
97:55 - beginners you'll be all good don't worry
97:57 - about it guys
97:59 - okay this is some examples of css for
98:01 - example here you can see
98:03 - this is an a tag and we're targeting a
98:06 - an a tag an a tag is basically a link
98:10 - and we're saying hey display block we're
98:12 - going to give it a padding which is
98:13 - basically some spacing
98:15 - we're going to give it a text decoration
98:16 - i'm going to give it a color as well
98:18 - and on the hover of this a tag it's
98:21 - going to be a cursor pointer with a new
98:23 - color of red
98:24 - and now this might not make sense that's
98:26 - okay you will learn this on the fly
98:30 - of course now we get to javascript this
98:31 - is where it's real actually really hard
98:33 - or it gets harder html css is not as bad
98:37 - as what this is okay so this is where
98:40 - you'll be learning data types so for
98:41 - example
98:42 - um you know data types like what are
98:44 - some data types jesse
98:47 - well we talked about this before right
98:49 - the data structure so
98:50 - this would be the linked list
98:53 - well i should talk about data types so
98:55 - numbers oh sorry numbers
98:57 - um arrays booleans
99:00 - strings um variables of course
99:04 - um wow that that
99:07 - that light green yellow is really hard
99:09 - to read nice
99:11 - i know it's okay i can't change it
99:15 - object uh objects
99:19 - and that's about it i think
99:22 - yeah these are the main data that you
99:24 - need to learn and a lot of stuff you can
99:26 - actually learn go to codecademy
99:28 - go to free code camp a lot of stuff you
99:30 - will see actually on there okay
99:32 - so feel free to use those libraries or
99:34 - those learning resources
99:36 - of course learn functions es6 function
99:39 - is a little piece
99:40 - of code that you can utilize um to
99:43 - kind of repeat that same piece of code
99:44 - so for example let's say
99:46 - that you want to you have a one you have
99:48 - a function for
99:49 - you know maybe grabbing some data you
99:51 - can reuse that function multiple times
99:53 - right
99:55 - dom manipulation dom manipulation is
99:58 - what
99:58 - who knows what dom manipulation is let
100:00 - me know in the chat who knows what dom
100:01 - manipulation is anybody
100:03 - put in the chat okay but tell me what is
100:07 - it
100:08 - don't just tell you i do just tell me
100:10 - what is it though
100:10 - [Music]
100:14 - tell us michael curry that's right when
100:17 - they put the nodes of it that's right so
100:19 - of course html has nodes right so and
100:21 - the document has nodes
100:23 - right and so downward pushes but
100:25 - manipulating those nodes so they look
100:26 - different
100:27 - okay so for example maybe i click on
100:29 - something and i want something else to
100:31 - appear on the page
100:32 - right maybe i want to appear a dialogue
100:36 - that's called dom manipulation i'm
100:37 - adding a new piece of html
100:40 - into the dom okay scope who knows what
100:43 - scope is
100:44 - anybody anybody who knows the scope is
100:47 - it's a more
100:48 - advanced topic more that's right so
100:51 - a scope is kind of like this kind of
100:52 - like imagine you have a
100:54 - a piece of paper right right and your
100:57 - scope is like
100:58 - your score is i'm saying hey your scope
101:00 - is this piece of paper you can only look
101:02 - at that piece of paper
101:04 - or maybe i can say hey your scope is on
101:06 - this little section on a piece of paper
101:08 - and so you can only see that section so
101:11 - when we talk about scope we talk about
101:13 - we can actually see all the little
101:15 - variables or the little
101:16 - data that i have in my application
101:19 - that's scope and again we'll talk more
101:21 - about that later on
101:23 - then there is this this is the hard
101:24 - stuff guys okay this is the hard stuff
101:27 - a data structures slash algorithms and
101:30 - so what those are are
101:32 - are what what are they jesse we just
101:35 - talked about this but stacks and queues
101:37 - of course okay um binary search trees
101:41 - linked lists um double linked list
101:44 - because you have two kinds of linked
101:46 - lists okay singly
101:47 - and double and um
101:50 - tries hashtables
101:54 - i want to say about it yeah i want to
101:56 - say as well like for example
101:59 - graphs as well and so forth yeah graphs
102:02 - yeah yeah so these are your data
102:04 - structures and then of course you get
102:06 - your face api this is actually get stuff
102:08 - from an api
102:09 - yeah that's right there's a hash you'll
102:11 - you'll see a hash table is uh
102:13 - it's just a very complicated way of
102:16 - mapping
102:17 - data you'll see a hash table actually
102:20 - consists of two types of data structures
102:22 - that's right i believe yeah that's right
102:25 - so this is an example of some javascript
102:28 - this is yeah i mean yeah this is pretty
102:31 - complicated but what's gonna happen here
102:32 - this is an array you guys can see this
102:35 - what do you guys think this is what what
102:36 - is this so this is an array
102:38 - what do you think this is anybody can
102:40 - guess what this is what is this
102:44 - that's right christopher this is an
102:45 - object it's an object okay
102:47 - who knows what this is what this
102:52 - what is that it's a key that's right
102:55 - this is a key
102:56 - and then what what is this right here
102:59 - value
103:00 - value right so an object has multiple
103:03 - keys and multiple values
103:04 - and i can actually reference them okay
103:07 - who knows for example
103:08 - what uh you know what is this right here
103:15 - filter function that's right it's a
103:19 - filter function that's actually
103:21 - already accessible for us that's right
103:23 - it's a filter function right
103:25 - and we can actually use it in our a
103:27 - piece of code as
103:28 - we don't have to create it it's already
103:30 - there for us by javascript
103:32 - that's right so that's right
103:36 - that's what we talk about let's talk
103:38 - about some frameworks
103:39 - so of course knowing javascript is your
103:41 - foundation it is your fundamentals okay
103:43 - but you cannot just stop there
103:45 - unfortunately right
103:47 - so nasa seems like you're not sharing
103:49 - your screen on youtube
103:51 - all right oh dang thank you jesse right
103:54 - there
103:54 - my bad yeah that's okay right there that
103:57 - shallow script alrighty
103:59 - right there hey okay sometimes forget
104:00 - that dang it i know why but sometimes i
104:02 - just forget that
104:04 - um so yeah there you go thank you guys
104:07 - by the way
104:08 - um so frameworks of course right these
104:11 - are most important things javascript can
104:13 - only take you so far
104:14 - at that point once you've learned
104:16 - javascript once you learn the basics
104:18 - then you have to actually learn the
104:19 - frameworks okay and what are those
104:21 - well you guys know that we have
104:23 - frameworks like angular so i actually
104:24 - started with angular my first framework
104:26 - was angularjs
104:28 - okay and imagine a framework it's kind
104:30 - of like
104:31 - it's kind of like the embassy
104:35 - hmm it's kind of like the engine imagine
104:39 - if
104:39 - a car right it's kind of like a car no
104:42 - imagine like this
104:44 - imagine a framework it's like you know
104:46 - how you have a house
104:47 - you know a house right a house is a
104:49 - house
104:50 - and then you have rooms imagine the
104:52 - framework is like the room so you can
104:54 - create the rooms
104:55 - and make it fancy that's what the
104:57 - framework allows you to do it makes it
104:58 - very easy for you okay
105:00 - so that's what that is that's angular we
105:03 - have vue.js which is another javascript
105:05 - uh framework
105:07 - and then of course we got react
105:10 - gs right here
105:14 - that's react.js for you right there okay
105:17 - beautiful and here are some companies
105:19 - who are using these technologies we've
105:21 - got for example
105:22 - you know angularjs oh right here oh
105:25 - wait wait right here used by companies
105:29 - like the guardian
105:30 - upwork paypal sony that's angular vigi
105:33 - oh yeah people in angular okay yeah
105:35 - airbnb instagram eats dropbox
105:38 - also for example facebook the new
105:39 - facebook is built with react.js of
105:41 - course because they made reactions
105:44 - also netflix yeah netflix is a big one
105:49 - that's right uh view gs alibaba
105:51 - grammarly you know dashboard gitlab and
105:53 - so forth right
105:55 - a lot of companies so what should i
105:58 - choose
105:59 - there's a lot of options you can you can
106:01 - honestly choose either
106:02 - you want to use vue.js go ahead there's
106:04 - going to be companies who are looking
106:05 - for that
106:06 - you want to use you know angular go
106:09 - ahead there are companies looking for
106:10 - that
106:11 - doesn't matter honestly for example for
106:14 - me i got a job at a company
106:16 - without really knowing react.js i got a
106:18 - i became a react.js developer without
106:20 - knowing react.js
106:21 - seriously i went to a company they're
106:24 - like nas but you don't know right yes
106:26 - you're right i don't know but i'm a good
106:27 - problem solver
106:28 - so you can either like me or you don't
106:30 - you know they send me
106:32 - like they literally send me these all
106:34 - these interview questions and they send
106:35 - me a test
106:36 - to do around a reg gs i completely
106:39 - flopped it completely failed
106:40 - they're like yeah you probably should
106:42 - learn some more reactions i'm like yeah
106:44 - that's fine i can probably learn erect
106:45 - on the job
106:46 - you know i learned i can learn on the
106:48 - job like oh okay okay okay
106:50 - and then they hired me you know and then
106:52 - i was making 10k a month
106:54 - right so there you go and then and then
106:56 - i learned react gs with them
106:58 - that's it the most important thing you
107:00 - need to learn is just pick one
107:02 - so the one that we usually go with is we
107:04 - just do react because
107:06 - it's one of the simpler ones to kind of
107:08 - learn it's there's not a lot of headache
107:11 - too much
107:12 - you know and it's becoming very popular
107:13 - that's why
107:16 - so companies already talked about this
107:18 - company is using javascript
107:19 - we know this already so resources to
107:22 - learn well there's a lot of research
107:24 - you can learn well there's a lot of web
107:25 - fundamentals by building projects
107:27 - resources
107:28 - uh there's also for example free code
107:31 - camp
107:32 - there's front and mentor okay and by the
107:35 - way with this one
107:37 - when you get on the graduation call and
107:39 - if you actually wanna
107:40 - have this like learn what developed by
107:42 - building projects just mention this to
107:44 - the person that you have the graduation
107:45 - call with and then we'll be able to give
107:47 - you it's like a small little course that
107:49 - we have for our students sometimes
107:51 - who want to build some cool projects so
107:53 - just note it down for yourself if you
107:55 - want to actually want this course
107:57 - once again a call with the person for
107:58 - the graduation call
108:00 - ask them for that and they'll give it to
108:01 - you okay free code cam from the mentor
108:05 - youtube of course uh if you go to us on
108:08 - youtube
108:08 - there's some great resources to learn to
108:10 - learn there we have a full-on html
108:13 - course on our course literally guys
108:15 - if you take this and you take this you
108:17 - know css
108:18 - done so here's what i commend to you
108:21 - every single person okay
108:22 - can i can i can i give you guys a
108:24 - recommendation to everybody
108:25 - this will be really helpful to you can i
108:28 - tell you guys this one
108:30 - i want all of you right now really easy

121:16 - beautiful
121:17 - perfect perfect so my question is that
121:21 - um okay you said that
121:24 - certifications are not important
121:27 - like what certificates are not important
121:29 - like what
121:31 - like during the interview when you go
121:33 - for a job right
121:35 - so so during the interview if the
121:38 - interviewer is asking okay
121:40 - if you have some certification house
121:42 - then show me
121:43 - or you know show me your certification
121:45 - your course
121:46 - your degree or something and if you
121:48 - don't have that how can we tackle those
121:50 - same
121:50 - kind of situation during an interview
121:53 - yeah
121:53 - so yeah so you see you say that kind of
121:55 - like this okay if you don't have
121:56 - certification you say
121:57 - hey i don't have certifications but i
121:59 - went to these places
122:01 - and instead of certifications i actually
122:03 - have projects to approve
122:04 - on what i did that's it
122:08 - okay like for example if you don't have
122:10 - if you don't get a certification from
122:12 - for example from us right let's just say
122:14 - you are in this challenge and there's no
122:16 - certification that you will be given to
122:17 - you
122:18 - you say okay well don't have
122:19 - certifications but here's the projects
122:20 - that we did
122:21 - that i learned and then hear the
122:23 - technologies that i learned there right
122:25 - and then you actually talk about what
122:27 - did you learn
122:28 - that's it so you talk about hey you know
122:29 - what i learned this
122:31 - i learned that i learned maybe how to
122:33 - create an api
122:35 - i learned how to create you know api
122:37 - routes
122:38 - that i created in front of a technolon
122:40 - application that will actually
122:41 - use the api routes you know and work
122:44 - together
122:45 - to create a whole web application system
122:47 - that's it
122:49 - okay so so because because uh i have
122:52 - seen
122:53 - uh when i have seen the job interview a
122:56 - job description they have like some of
122:59 - the companies have
123:00 - over here have like certifications a
123:02 - month or a degree is a must
123:04 - you know let's still apply still apply
123:08 - a lot of those descriptions on um
123:11 - in terms of uh given about developers or
123:14 - descriptions on
123:15 - job postings are a bunch of [ __ ]
123:19 - okay because and it's not their fault
123:22 - and it's not their fault because
123:23 - sometimes for example you know um
123:26 - a lot a lot of times big companies uh
123:29 - they will have for example uh it's right
123:31 - it's hr so hr will actually have
123:34 - uh they're given all these little things
123:36 - that they you know oh this guy needs to
123:38 - have this and this
123:39 - like there's there's job postings where
123:41 - it says like 10 years of experience
123:43 - you know 10 years of coding something
123:44 - really that doesn't [ __ ] matter you
123:46 - know like
123:47 - it doesn't matter as long as the team
123:49 - likes you and as long as you pass the
123:51 - interview and you know what you're
123:52 - talking about
123:53 - the team will overlook everything else
123:55 - that you have
123:57 - by the way guys i've never even applied
124:00 - for a job like a position that was
124:02 - available
124:04 - i just looked for companies that i liked
124:07 - and even though they didn't have
124:09 - a junior position at the time or an
124:11 - internship i would still send them an
124:13 - email send them an email letter
124:14 - that's right real that's it
124:17 - that's it so it's so it's more it's more
124:20 - of a connection what you make and
124:23 - the presentation what you give in during
124:24 - an interview that's right that's much
124:26 - about right that's right it's right it's
124:27 - more so how you showcase yourself
124:29 - and how you make the other person feel
124:31 - about you
124:33 - okay okay so don't ever when they talk
124:36 - with certifications don't ever
124:38 - let them bog you down because don't ever
124:41 - let them think that
124:42 - oh you know because i don't have
124:44 - certification
124:45 - i'm not good enough or or you know
124:48 - that it's a must no be confident with it
124:52 - yeah you know what no i don't
124:53 - did not get a certification because i
124:55 - think it's unnecessary
124:56 - or i think it's not needed for me what
124:59 - most i got from it is knowledge and i
125:00 - built these amazing projects with what i
125:02 - learned
125:03 - that's it depends makes sense
125:06 - thank you thank you so much and you say
125:08 - you say it proudly
125:10 - so samir actually say with me right now
125:12 - so if i was an interviewer
125:14 - and i interviewed right now i say hey
125:16 - samir you know but what kind of
125:18 - certifications have you had like i feel
125:20 - like certifications are really important
125:21 - some of your
125:22 - what will be your response uh i would
125:25 - say that
125:26 - uh i don't have a certification but what
125:28 - i have is
125:29 - the projects which i have worked on
125:31 - myself and i've been building with my
125:33 - own with using my own
125:35 - knowledge and and um the skills i know
125:38 - about the
125:38 - language i can show you the how does it
125:41 - work and the main the whole
125:43 - project by itself so okay all right
125:46 - beautiful
125:48 - i think you could put even more
125:49 - confidence into that to speak very
125:51 - clearly
125:52 - so i think let's try one more time okay
125:53 - i want you to speak a little bit more
125:55 - about okay what did you learn so i want
125:57 - you to actually go deeper into what you
125:59 - actually learned
126:01 - okay so i don't have a certificate with
126:03 - me but rather i have projects
126:06 - which have built just using html
126:09 - css and javascript okay and
126:12 - in those i have in in in terms of html
126:16 - it's just basic html but when it comes
126:18 - to css i've used
126:19 - uh flexbox i have used great for
126:23 - for positioning of the of the of the
126:26 - content in my website
126:27 - and and and when it comes to javascript
126:30 - i've used uh
126:31 - i've used a uh apis to
126:35 - which which which interacts the backend
126:38 - on the front end of the website
126:40 - so yeah that's good that's good really
126:43 - good stuff that's
126:44 - good the only thing i would say for you
126:45 - to work on is maybe
126:47 - say it maybe more louder and maybe say
126:49 - with the
126:50 - without more of like a hunch you know
126:53 - making sure that
126:54 - that you're more of a you know you've
126:55 - got more of a stance on it right so
126:58 - as long as you're like not breaking your
126:59 - voice because that says a lot as well so
127:01 - they're
127:01 - an interview they're reading you a lot
127:03 - in an interview
127:05 - they're going to read you a lot so for
127:07 - example for those of you guys who signed
127:09 - up for hacker noon you know
127:11 - um hacking we actually did a interview
127:12 - with hacker and we talked about
127:14 - how does he hire he hires a lot based on
127:17 - just how you speak
127:18 - and how you talk like how you're
127:21 - compassionate
127:23 - that's right like they hire a lot about
127:26 - you know are you truthful right
127:29 - if you're simply just truthful if you're
127:31 - not making a [ __ ]
127:33 - if you're a truthful person that's this
127:35 - person they want to hire they hire a lot
127:36 - more on soft skills right now
127:38 - he said it himself go watch the video
127:40 - guys it's on a youtube channel it's with
127:42 - the hacker and ceo
127:44 - go watch it you'll see it it's there
127:47 - and so that's why i say soft skills are
127:49 - so important in this industry
127:51 - okay so you're doing you're doing good
127:54 - just be more confident stay present
127:56 - and that's it i'm here okay thank you
127:58 - thank you so much
127:59 - uh announced once again you got it my
128:01 - friend you got it okay perfect
128:03 - all right next one what's up and if you
128:05 - guys have any questions let me go ahead
128:06 - i'm with you from spotlight
128:08 - all right any other questions here
128:12 - let me see if i have anyone else
128:15 - uh tamiz go ahead
128:20 - okay um yeah i want to say hi dummies
128:24 - hello can you hear me yeah we can hear
128:28 - you go ahead
128:29 - you speak up a little bit more i think
128:32 - oh okay
128:33 - is that better yeah yes okay
128:36 - um i wanted to take the freelance route
128:39 - okay
128:41 - but i'm still like learning the
128:42 - foundations
128:44 - um i do have a decent grasp on some
128:47 - things
128:48 - what exactly would i need before i put
128:50 - myself out there because
128:52 - i don't want to start putting myself out
128:54 - there and then
128:55 - i'm not able to do what's required and
128:57 - then next thing you know i develop a bad
128:58 - reputation
128:59 - right yeah so good question good
129:01 - question i think maybe just you want to
129:03 - take over for that
129:05 - so um first of all a freelancer
129:09 - um like i talked about before it's not
129:12 - only having technical skills
129:14 - okay because you also need to get
129:17 - clients
129:18 - get paid so you gotta do acquisition um
129:21 - you gotta do the contracts
129:22 - you gotta do the invoicing so there's a
129:24 - whole
129:25 - you gotta learn how to run a business
129:28 - next to doing technical skills
129:29 - when you become a freelancer okay so
129:32 - that's something you have to be aware of
129:34 - when starting out as a freelancer first
129:36 - of all second is
129:37 - um you're saying you don't want to get
129:40 - the bad
129:41 - repetition the thing is though
129:44 - we can't really control the future in
129:47 - the sense of
129:48 - you know sometimes you just gotta try it
129:50 - out and do your utter best
129:52 - right and then hope you'll just work
129:54 - hard enough on it and make it succeed
129:56 - make it work okay so there's no such
130:00 - thing as a bad repetition if you just
130:01 - keep in contact with your client
130:04 - and keep communicating and also what's
130:06 - very important
130:08 - um a very good freelancer or a very good
130:10 - developer is somebody who communicates
130:12 - very well so that means
130:14 - meeting your clients expectations
130:18 - at all times so if you feel like you can
130:21 - finish this project within the next two
130:23 - months
130:24 - great don't tell the client that tell
130:26 - the client
130:27 - they're getting the project in three
130:29 - months
130:31 - then maybe ask for support next to it so
130:34 - you can also make it within that those
130:35 - three months
130:36 - and you're delivering it then you know
130:39 - maybe
130:40 - you're becoming so good you're able to
130:42 - deliver it in two and a half months
130:45 - guess what you're over delivering and
130:47 - your client is happy but you didn't
130:49 - um how to say you didn't cut yourself
130:52 - short
130:53 - because you were honest to yourself and
130:56 - you are meeting the expectations of the
130:57 - client
130:58 - so there's no way that a bad reputation
131:00 - can come from that as long as you're
131:02 - loyal integer and are committed okay
131:06 - first of all that second of all i would
131:09 - um as a freelancer you do need the
131:11 - technical skills
131:13 - now as a freelancer you can either work
131:14 - solo or you can start creating your own
131:16 - team
131:18 - the thing is though if you start
131:19 - freelancing but this is just my personal
131:21 - opinion
131:21 - if you start freelancing but you've
131:23 - never worked in a professional
131:25 - environment as a software developer
131:27 - it's going to be really hard because you
131:29 - don't know really how
131:30 - a software developer team works at that
131:32 - moment
131:34 - you don't know the process you don't
131:36 - have the process just yet right
131:38 - yeah your internet is breaking up naz oh
131:41 - really oh i think i'm good
131:44 - um so i would say before going into
131:48 - freelancing you should start
131:50 - for one year have a job as a software
131:53 - developer just to get the experience
131:55 - just to know how it is to work in a
131:58 - software development environment
131:59 - in a corporate environment how they work
132:01 - with github how they plan their projects
132:03 - how much time it takes to finish a
132:04 - project what they do with testing
132:08 - because that way um you learn all of
132:10 - that
132:11 - without having to risk it all for
132:13 - yourself which you do as a freelancer
132:15 - you bury the you carry the risk
132:17 - when you're a freelancer that's right
132:19 - okay so that that would be my advice
132:21 - um that freelancing just started
132:23 - straight off the bat it's not
132:25 - easy i wouldn't also not recommend that
132:28 - because
132:29 - you don't want to be focused on running
132:30 - the business you want to be focused on
132:32 - learning the technical skills okay and
132:35 - if you become
132:36 - a software developer you work there for
132:37 - two years great
132:39 - you got experience on the technical
132:41 - level now you can see
132:42 - how they run their business and you can
132:44 - copy that if they're really
132:46 - a good startup or something you know and
132:48 - also build network
132:50 - because if you become a freelancer now
132:52 - off the bat it's going to be hard
132:54 - for you to also put time in to
132:56 - networking
132:57 - that's right as you know you come to our
132:59 - community and all that of course there
133:01 - are things like that but you have to
133:02 - invest time in that
133:03 - next to that okay does it answer your
133:06 - question
133:08 - yes it does but uh from your answer
133:11 - it brings me to another question um
133:16 - what you said about starting out with um
133:19 - a company for about a year so okay
133:23 - what is the skill should i expect to
133:25 - have
133:26 - like that i need to go in there just
133:28 - beginning like
133:30 - do i need to have all the data
133:32 - structures and
133:33 - apis and all like that and just have all
133:36 - this knowledge or
133:37 - like what what do i uh actually need to
133:40 - before i start you know applying so good
133:43 - good
133:44 - yeah good point excellent question nice
133:46 - so for this one
133:48 - is nothing crazy
133:51 - learn javascript on html or css
133:54 - the way you learn those is you build
133:56 - more projects
133:58 - you know and you keep doing things on
134:00 - your own so for example maybe you
134:02 - built a few projects through youtube now
134:04 - maybe you build a few projects of
134:06 - yourself that you want to do
134:08 - okay so you do that besides that
134:12 - the one hunkered out because once you
134:14 - build projects okay great you i've built
134:15 - some projects i know
134:17 - javascript i know html and no css okay
134:19 - great i know that
134:21 - once you've learned that maybe now you
134:23 - go a step forward and then you learn a
134:24 - little bit of reactions so just
134:26 - you know a simple framework that you can
134:29 - bring to attend attention when you go
134:31 - into an interview
134:32 - that makes you a much better a suitable
134:35 - for a job
134:36 - okay if you know a framework like
134:38 - react.js or vue.js or angular
134:40 - and so i always recommend you know
134:42 - react.js just as a starter but you can
134:44 - pick anyone
134:46 - as you're doing that the one thing
134:49 - you're going to see yourself stuck with
134:50 - is actually the interview process
134:54 - the interview is not going to be as hard
134:56 - as actually passing the interview
134:59 - okay once you've got a good portfolio
135:02 - you have some good knowledge around
135:03 - javascript html
135:05 - css react.js uh you know maybe
135:08 - node.js you've got some good knowledge
135:11 - around that
135:12 - and you maybe you went and you went to
135:14 - the interview
135:15 - the hard thing is now passing the
135:16 - interview but the thing is when you pass
135:18 - the interview you
135:19 - it's you you will need to learn those
135:22 - foundations
135:23 - and the foundations are the following it
135:25 - is the algorithms it is a data
135:27 - structures
135:28 - it's all of those so right now
135:32 - what i want you to focus on is focus on
135:36 - learn this fundamentals so like free
135:37 - code camp maybe you know
135:40 - um maybe udacity maybe
135:43 - uh you go to code academy you learn
135:45 - those fundamentals of javascript html
135:47 - css
135:48 - and then maybe you start building
135:50 - projects
135:52 - but you build one or two projects from
135:55 - tutorials
135:56 - and that's okay but then you have to do
135:58 - things by yourself
136:00 - so i recommend for people to do the
136:02 - following build a project from a
136:04 - tutorial
136:05 - and then add your own something to it
136:09 - okay that will actually teach you how to
136:12 - do it
136:13 - okay because without that all you're
136:16 - doing just copying and you're watching
136:18 - somebody else do it and that's not
136:19 - necessary that's not useful at all
136:22 - what is useful however is when you're
136:25 - using your brain
136:28 - right and the ideas are coming from you
136:32 - and the problem-solving is coming from
136:34 - you that is what's useful
136:37 - so right now i just want you to focus on
136:38 - the knowledge
136:40 - and building up the portfolio that's
136:45 - all it thanks a lot to answer your
136:46 - question yes it did

137:25 - otherwise it's really hard for me to
137:26 - actually see you guys okay
137:31 - if we don't need questions we're gonna
137:33 - stop here in a second let me see here
137:37 - me daniel daniel amiya let me see if i
137:41 - can see you here
137:44 - [Music]
137:46 - i'm mion okay
137:53 - hey daniel hey what's going on guys how
137:55 - are you my friend
137:56 - what's up danielle so um for somebody
138:00 - that's a full stack engineer just coming
138:02 - out of
138:03 - uh a boot camp
138:06 - oh dang okay what boot camp where'd you
138:09 - go
138:10 - kenzie academy oh how have a few people
138:12 - who went there
138:13 - okay yeah um my question is for someone
138:17 - that's
138:17 - coming out of boot camp and someone
138:20 - that's
138:20 - you know as we know boot camps
138:24 - they cram everything in at a certain
138:26 - amount of time that's right
138:28 - and it's it's hard for some people to
138:31 - really
138:32 - grasp the knowledge that's being given
138:36 - to them
138:36 - so for me i what what my question is is
138:40 - is
138:41 - anyone here at clever programmer
138:44 - able to be a mentor to someone like me
138:48 - coming out of a boot camp so i guess my
138:50 - question is
138:52 - anyone of you two able to be
138:56 - a mentor for someone like me so
138:59 - we don't have a mentorship program per
139:01 - se right
139:02 - but we do have a mentorship through
139:04 - other ways
139:06 - so let me ask you that okay why are you
139:08 - looking for a mentor right now why
139:09 - aren't you
139:10 - why aren't you ready to apply for jobs
139:12 - right now
139:13 - you just came from booth camp how many
139:14 - months did you do it
139:16 - uh one full year one full year okay
139:20 - all right why do you feel like at this
139:21 - point you don't need a mentor
139:25 - i i think i just i mean i
139:28 - honestly feel that i need a little more
139:30 - help to keep myself
139:32 - uh focus on
139:37 - i think more i'm looking more focused on
139:40 - the front end
139:41 - okay so okay great so i'm trying to
139:43 - understand why so tell me why in that
139:45 - case what what are
139:46 - some things that you feel like you're
139:47 - not comfortable with
139:53 - i think more i'm more uncomfortable with
139:58 - the first half of the boot camp was
140:00 - front end and then the second half was
140:03 - all back in
140:04 - like python django and you know rest
140:06 - framework
140:07 - and so front end which used what
140:09 - technologies tell me
140:11 - html css react express node.js
140:16 - mongodb okay so
140:20 - what do you not know about react.js
140:22 - that's hard for you to understand
140:24 - give them something not what i don't
140:25 - know i think it's just more that
140:28 - i would have to focus more on um
140:32 - i mean i have i have the i have the
140:34 - projects and everything like that i
140:36 - think i just need
140:38 - to focus more on the skills that i've
140:41 - learned
140:42 - and actually apply them myself
140:45 - and you know be able to
140:48 - um you know the way i i learned is if
140:51 - you don't use it you lose it
140:53 - that's true 100 yeah so let me ask you
140:56 - this okay
140:58 - okay do you know any algorithms data
141:00 - structures do you know for example
141:01 - stacks queues
141:03 - you know how did you get the chance to
141:05 - learn those at your kenzie academy
141:07 - yes okay so if i ask you a question very
141:10 - simple right now i asked you hey
141:12 - daniel uh create for me a function that
141:14 - will merge to a race together can you do
141:16 - it for me on the spot right now
141:18 - no no
141:21 - it's been that long like no because
141:24 - the the way the schooling had worked
141:26 - they focused us
141:28 - as soon as you move away they didn't
141:30 - give us enough time
141:31 - to allow i i well i didn't i wasn't able
141:35 - to go back and
141:37 - just continue to work on it on my own
141:41 - because i was just more focused on what
141:44 - was right there in front of me
141:45 - gotcha so then in that case did you
141:47 - actually learn those data structures
141:50 - yes well right but you can't answer that
141:53 - question
141:54 - right not without going back
141:58 - and have to think about it i couldn't
142:00 - answer that right right
142:01 - see but what i asked you is a very
142:03 - simple interview question
142:05 - right right so
142:09 - i'm just i'm asking these questions i'm
142:10 - trying to understand where the root
142:12 - is right to understand what the root
142:15 - problem is
142:16 - and i still think the real problem is
142:19 - add those
142:20 - funded foundations and fundamentals and
142:22 - i do think that it's about also using
142:24 - the knowledge that you've learned which
142:25 - is react gs and actually applying more
142:27 - of that towards the real world
142:30 - right but it's not just that it's also
142:32 - about learn those foundational
142:33 - fundamental skills
142:35 - because you've got the portfolio okay
142:38 - you went for one year
142:39 - right you know towards the kenzie
142:41 - academy or whatever it's called
142:43 - and you've got the portfolio it's it's
142:46 - there
142:47 - i'm guessing you built projects there
142:49 - correct correct yes
142:51 - you just start applying for jobs the
142:52 - best way to use what you learned
142:54 - is to just apply for jobs okay
142:57 - but the issue becomes here is not
143:00 - applying for jobs it's actually getting
143:01 - the job
143:04 - to get to get the job right because once
143:06 - you're in it and they see your portfolio
143:08 - and you've known some stuff okay great
143:09 - then you actually start to use
143:11 - what you've learned and that's how you
143:12 - get to learn even more you see what i
143:14 - mean
143:15 - so the most important thing is not just
143:16 - about using more of what you know
143:18 - it's actually more about using what you
143:20 - currently know using that to apply
143:22 - to a position and then you just see
143:25 - yourself growing from there
143:28 - right but the issue is getting that job
143:30 - so what you need to now learn
143:32 - is is actually you need to start
143:34 - applying for jobs like literally right
143:36 - now
143:37 - i i've been applying for jobs you know
143:40 - okay i've been applying uh
143:43 - mainly front-end jobs okay and have you
143:46 - gotten any interviews
143:48 - no no interviews yet no interviews why
143:50 - is that what do you why do you think
143:52 - that's the case
143:56 - um maybe i need to work on a resume
144:00 - okay that's part one work on uh
144:06 - bettering my resume maybe you know
144:09 - but i am also working with uh i guess
144:12 - kenzie academy has a career team that
144:15 - helps you with
144:16 - building up the right resumes and uh
144:19 - getting a portfolio together
144:21 - but i've learned my portfolio through
144:23 - you guys i didn't use
144:25 - you know what what kenzie academy wanted
144:28 - me as a portfolio so really
144:31 - yeah i it look it just
144:35 - clever programmer uh portfolio it just
144:38 - looks better
144:39 - okay officially visually and
144:42 - functionally it looks better
144:43 - okay great that's awesome that's awesome
144:45 - i'm happy to happy to hear that that you
144:47 - you actually use that
144:49 - um but right well now what i see is okay
144:53 - now you when you're applying for jobs
144:55 - what might be stopping you is part one
144:57 - is your resume and part two your
144:59 - portfolio
145:00 - and your linkedin so you need to work on
145:03 - those three things so you need to go
145:04 - back to kenzie
145:05 - and to talk them be like hey you know
145:06 - what i need to improve my linkedin your
145:08 - resume because
145:09 - like or not no matter what you know if
145:10 - your resume sucks and your like thing
145:12 - sucks it doesn't matter
145:14 - then that case whatever you know that
145:15 - does not matter at all right
145:17 - you see what i mean so yes what needs to
145:20 - happen here is
145:21 - you need to go back to them talk to them
145:23 - and say hey you know can somebody help
145:24 - me with my
145:25 - portfolio or my just simple resume
145:27 - because resume says a lot
145:29 - and is the reason why either you get
145:31 - submitted into the pile of
145:33 - yes interview them or no i do not want
145:36 - to interview them
145:39 - because that's the only way they know
145:40 - you they only know you their resume how
145:42 - else are they do they know you
145:43 - right they don't know you they can't see
145:46 - you
145:48 - they don't know who you are where you're
145:49 - from what you know hell no they only
145:52 - know you through your resume
145:53 - and if it's nicely built the way it's
145:55 - supposed to be
145:57 - then yes you have an opportunity there
145:59 - that's the first thing you need to fix
146:01 - okay okay second thing you need to fix
146:04 - is
146:05 - okay apply for more jobs so how many
146:07 - jobs have you applied to
146:11 - about 50 jobs so far i need to apply
146:13 - them more
146:15 - right so that's part of one is applying
146:17 - to more jobs there should be
146:19 - a minimum of 100 to 200 jobs applied in
146:21 - general
146:23 - okay right maybe even 300 jobs
146:26 - that's possible too right okay
146:30 - so that's another portion of it
146:33 - then when you're applying for jobs and
146:34 - this should literally be your job
146:36 - should be to apply for jobs right now
146:39 - that should literally just be your job
146:42 - and while you're doing that you need to
146:43 - be freshen up on your algorithms and
146:45 - data structures
146:46 - you need to go to youtube and you need
146:48 - to learn algorithms and data structures
146:50 - go to youtube type in algorithms data
146:52 - structures just type it in
146:55 - and learn those stacks cues you need to
146:57 - buy a book
146:58 - called cracking the coding interview
147:01 - okay
147:02 - okay it's called cracking the corgi
147:04 - write that down
147:05 - very important cracking the coding
147:08 - interview
147:10 - that's right you need to go to websites
147:13 - like lead code
147:15 - like hacker rank and you need to
147:18 - practice those algorithms and data
147:20 - structures because like it or not
147:22 - you will be asked those questions what i
147:23 - asked you i said i asked you a question
147:25 - daniel right
147:26 - i asked you can you emerge to a race for
147:28 - me together
147:29 - that is the simplest question that you
147:30 - will be asked another question for
147:32 - example i was asked this question
147:35 - create for me a function that will
147:36 - reverse and narrate
147:39 - can you do that
147:44 - can you reverse an array from me
147:48 - you have an array reverse it using a
147:50 - function can you do that
147:55 - not right now right so you need to learn
147:58 - those type of things
147:59 - i'm asking you because i i want to get
148:00 - to the root again i'm just getting the
148:02 - right
148:03 - thing right this is really important
148:04 - it's a really important conversation
148:05 - we're having
148:06 - yes right so get to the root so you need
148:10 - to learn those
148:11 - algorithms to data structures and that
148:13 - is actually how you will become a better
148:15 - developer
148:16 - and how not only will you become a
148:18 - better developer you will become more
148:20 - confident
148:21 - and that is what will train you for the
148:23 - actual interview
148:25 - is what i mean yes so keep using that
148:30 - keep interview or keep applying for jobs
148:33 - fix your before you apply to more jobs
148:35 - make sure you you run your
148:37 - resume and your linkedin by someone
148:39 - because for example for us
148:40 - when we run our own bootcamp we have a
148:42 - booth team called full stack mastery
148:43 - bootcamp
148:44 - when we do it we have a specific theory
148:46 - two three week process where we
148:49 - fix your resume and we fix your linkedin
148:51 - because it's so important
148:55 - okay so make sure you go back to kenzie
148:57 - and actually fix it with them
149:01 - that's part one and then of course and
149:04 - then just
149:04 - you know focus on the algorithms and
149:06 - data structures so that you're prepared
149:08 - for the interview when that does come
149:09 - around
149:11 - got it okay and if you do want
149:14 - more mentorship then did you schedule
149:16 - your graduation call by any chance
149:18 - i scheduled it when i first signed up

154:53 - okay i see you my friend asked to unmute
154:56 - go ahead frank i can't get me
155:00 - hi frank hello hello hello
155:03 - so uh yeah i'm pursuing a cs master
155:07 - degree and i'm
155:08 - uh expected to do graduate this december
155:12 - so i'm just looking for a job but
155:16 - as i actually had the internship last
155:19 - year about kind of like a front-end
155:22 - but unfortunately i didn't learn too
155:26 - much from that
155:27 - because they just gave me some
155:30 - code you know like they use the angular
155:34 - and it's a little hard for me to get
155:37 - started because i learned to learn
155:39 - uh kind of wet web development during
155:42 - master
155:43 - you know uh graduate years i only
155:46 - learned learning
155:47 - undergraduate with php that part so yeah
155:50 - you know it's outdated right so
155:52 - yeah and actually the thing is
155:56 - after last internship i just
156:00 - don't know uh what you started and now
156:03 - a little hard for me to land a
156:07 - job or something so i just want to ask
156:10 - uh what what kind of thing to uh
156:14 - i can improve from the resume because
156:16 - some uh
156:17 - when i have the interview they just ask
156:19 - me uh is that
156:20 - uh does that the class project you did
156:24 - or do did you do something out outside
156:26 - the classroom but
156:28 - uh uh unfortunately i don't do too much
156:31 - on that
156:32 - yeah but you but you but you had an
156:34 - internship right
156:36 - uh last year but it's on campus year one
156:39 - yeah yeah but
156:40 - but it's still an internship that you
156:41 - did right and it still involved coding
156:46 - yeah that well can i say it again
156:50 - so so the internship that you did did
156:52 - that involve
156:53 - coding yeah yeah involve coding that's
156:56 - the front end
156:56 - uh yeah so but i just feel a little
157:00 - bad they just send me the code send me
157:03 - the api you know
157:04 - the swagger swagger the documentation
157:08 - but uh i just don't know
157:11 - what what to start and
157:14 - that's a little struggling i mean yeah
157:17 - no for sure for sure
157:18 - for sure i think um what country amber
157:21 - are you
157:21 - at usa yeah i mean los angeles now oh
157:24 - you're los angeles okay
157:26 - and i i plan to join the on-site boot
157:28 - camp
157:29 - on well
157:45 - we'll help you what we'll walk you
157:46 - through and how to improve that okay
157:48 - so that's part one all right that just
157:50 - gave me an idea let me write that down
157:51 - hold on
157:52 - um um
157:58 - let me see uh resume linkedin okay sorry
158:02 - just give me an idea that's why
158:03 - so i think for you uh
158:07 - if you feel like you're just not
158:08 - comfortable enough for example if they
158:10 - give you a project to do
158:12 - okay frank if they give you a project to
158:14 - do and you just simply don't know where
158:16 - to start
158:17 - let me ask you this where do you think
158:20 - you should start like
158:21 - what do you think you should start if
158:23 - they give you this build this api with
158:25 - swagger
158:26 - let's just talk about that where do you
158:27 - think you should start
158:30 - what i'm doing last year i'm what i'm
158:33 - doing try to
158:35 - uh mapping the code the part of code
158:38 - with
158:39 - uh the you know the part on the
158:43 - windows you know on the window on the
158:45 - scope
158:46 - for example the which table uh
158:49 - does this code do or what we were
158:53 - kind of like uh word part
158:56 - words uh what parts that this code
158:59 - uh try to do so i just try to
159:03 - make this mapping thing so right yeah
159:05 - and
159:06 - try to learn the documentation but
159:10 - actually i don't really know how to use
159:12 - postman like
159:13 - you know that so that's another thing
159:16 - because i didn't
159:18 - learn it before so that's but can you
159:21 - learn it can you still learn though can
159:22 - you still
159:23 - learn um can you still learn that
159:26 - communication or no okay like do you
159:28 - think that you
159:29 - if you were given that task to to learn
159:31 - how to use swagger can you do you think
159:33 - you can learn it actually
159:36 - no that's why i don't know how to start
159:39 - what
159:40 - i yeah i mean just so many things i
159:43 - don't know
159:44 - at that time angularjs the swagger how
159:47 - does this
159:48 - front-end background work works because
159:51 - usually i just
159:52 - build my personal project you know
159:54 - that's kind of thing
159:55 - i know everything back and forth but
159:59 - in that part i i can't get access to the
160:02 - background code or yeah it's a little
160:05 - hard it's a big project
160:07 - so i can only do this part so
160:11 - just a little little bit
160:15 - uh uncomfortable so look i i think i
160:18 - think i think for you what
160:20 - might be the best to start out with is
160:23 - you need to look at this this big
160:24 - problem and divide into small problems
160:27 - so let's say for example you have to
160:28 - create an api with swagger
160:30 - right you know and so forth right you
160:33 - think about okay
160:34 - well one how do i create an api that's
160:37 - part of one okay
160:38 - so maybe you do research on how to
160:39 - create an api this is this is all about
160:42 - problem solving guys it's just all about
160:43 - problem solving
160:45 - right there were everybody were at a
160:47 - point where they did not know how to do
160:49 - something
160:50 - and then they learned it right
160:53 - so you're the point where you remember
160:54 - you don't know those technologies you
160:56 - don't know where to start
160:57 - but where to start is okay looking at
160:59 - the big picture here
161:01 - okay what are some small problems that i
161:03 - see well
161:05 - what the problems i see i see okay
161:08 - i see an api okay how can i solve this
161:11 - remember
161:12 - it's where were those two philosophies
161:14 - how can i solve it and then the fact
161:15 - that i can't solve it
161:17 - your question should be how can i solve
161:19 - it so api section how do i solve the api
161:22 - section how do i create an api
161:24 - maybe that's what you focus on okay next
161:26 - one swagger
161:27 - okay how do i use swagger how do i
161:29 - understand swagger
161:31 - you go to youtube you figure out okay
161:32 - how do i understand swagger
161:35 - to actually use it because swagger role
161:37 - is documentation for your api
161:39 - correct yeah that's right right
161:42 - so you look at that and you figure that
161:45 - portion out
161:46 - once you forget that portion okay okay i
161:48 - kind of understand what it's asking me
161:49 - to do
161:50 - let's now take it step by step so you
161:52 - think about okay i'm going to give
161:54 - myself
161:54 - one day to create my first api endpoint
161:58 - maybe at first i will create my node.js
162:00 - server api or whatever that might be
162:02 - so i look up okay let's figure out how
162:04 - to create how do you create an api
162:07 - you go to youtube you figure out how do
162:08 - you create an api
162:10 - and you do that and maybe it has nothing
162:13 - to do with swagger or
162:15 - with the project that you're doing but
162:17 - you were
162:18 - but you put yourself in that situation
162:20 - to actually learn it
162:23 - small steps so you did that small step
162:27 - what's next after you've done that
162:29 - what's next then
162:30 - tell me uh
162:34 - i guess try to use the
162:37 - api documentation we have to test my
162:41 - code or
162:42 - test the just the code
162:45 - we we already have i mean that's right
162:48 - that's right you test the code that's
162:50 - right you test the code and you see
162:51 - you know if it works or not you started
162:53 - to test the api
162:56 - so these little things that you have to
162:58 - try and do
163:00 - that get you to the actual the actual uh
163:03 - you know
163:03 - full-on process for me for example when
163:07 - i had my first internship
163:08 - frank okay i'll give an example i had my
163:11 - first internship and before i had it the
163:13 - way i got it was really interesting i
163:14 - was a creative computing club
163:17 - okay and i saw this one guy who was
163:19 - building a project called trandala
163:23 - right and they will build this
163:24 - application that's really cool and there
163:25 - was a web application
163:27 - i was like oh my god can i build this
163:29 - can i work with you guys can i help you
163:30 - guys out
163:31 - like yeah sure so to actually get into
163:34 - the internship they gave me a task
163:36 - they said hey nas create for us a web
163:39 - scraper that will scrape data from this
163:41 - website
163:42 - using python so what did i do
163:46 - i went home and the first question i
163:48 - typed into google was
163:50 - what is python
163:54 - not kidding yeah i had the same
163:58 - what is my name that's right like
163:59 - literally i had no idea how to use
164:01 - what is python how to use it so i'll
164:03 - look at what is python and i kind of
164:05 - learn some things about python
164:07 - then i ask myself question okay how do i
164:09 - scrape data from a database so i said
164:11 - how to build a scraper in python and i
164:14 - saw a bunch of tutorials on medium on
164:16 - youtube
164:17 - and how they built scrapers on python so
164:20 - i watched them and i saw what they did
164:21 - and i
164:22 - actually built projects with them once i
164:25 - learned that
164:25 - those little two pieces i'm like okay so
164:27 - time to build my own scraper
164:30 - i realized that i can use beautiful soup
164:33 - and then i can use a link and then i can
164:35 - simply just get the html and then i use
164:37 - the specific a
164:39 - html html attributes to actually get
164:41 - certain aspects of the actual data
164:45 - that's it and i built this scraper now i
164:48 - want you to ask me how much do you think
164:49 - how long do you think that took me
164:54 - two weeks two days two days
165:00 - what's very visible here nas is that you
165:03 - ask the right questions
165:06 - and when you ask the right questions
165:07 - guys you get the right answers
165:09 - simple as that so frank it's just a
165:12 - matter of asking the right questions
165:14 - like when i say that before you know
165:16 - like it's not about why can't i solve it
165:18 - it's about how can i solve this
165:20 - what is the next step what should i be
165:22 - looking at where can i get clarity on
165:25 - what's my plan you know that sort of
165:27 - stuff
165:28 - wow can i break this bra problem into
165:30 - small pieces
165:31 - what is one small piece and what would
165:33 - be the next small piece i have to solve
165:35 - you know that sort of things does that
165:37 - answer your question
165:39 - yeah this is my first question and uh
165:42 - after that
165:43 - what i said is uh landing for the next
165:46 - job next
165:46 - internship maybe like in the fourth
165:48 - semester or something but
165:50 - uh i just want to know how i can
165:53 - do on my resume of some projects which
165:57 - they just don't think that it's just a
166:00 - class project
166:01 - you you did every student do that
166:05 - so just do more projects that's it what
166:07 - do you think is the answer that if
166:08 - they if they're saying it's not enough
166:10 - product then what is the answer
166:15 - what is the answer that you know what
166:17 - the answer is
166:18 - huh i mean tell them what what i learned
166:21 - from it but
166:22 - they just think if it's a class project
166:24 - they
166:25 - feel like frank is so frank then what is
166:29 - the answer to that
166:31 - what is the answer that
166:36 - they're saying that they don't want
166:38 - class projects or it's not enough for
166:40 - them
166:40 - yeah yeah right so what is the
166:42 - resolution
166:44 - what is the solution
166:48 - it was a build by our by myself
166:51 - outside the classroom right though yeah
166:54 - yeah that's the thing that's it there's
166:56 - no other solution
167:00 - so what are you gonna do now
167:03 - doing my own project so that's why i
167:06 - just
167:07 - want to join this bootcamp and try to
167:10 - maybe
167:11 - think about what i will do so no don't

you're pretty good at it anyways um on a serious note i actually did have the chance i've been coding for the past 10 years and i've been the business actually you know working for people for the past probably five years or so um i've got a chance to interview with companies like google like squarespace khan academy twitter palantir and more um i've had i've got the chance to open companies like volunteer and google actually flew me out fully to california it was really cool you know it was a really cool trip they paid for the whole thing that was the best part about it you know and plus i got to learn a lot from them that's what happens when companies like that fly you out to cali yeah stuff cool stuff happens all right and this is jesse and i'll let jesse talk about yourself this is me one also of the head instructors of our full stack mastery boot camp okay our eight month online program i studied law i did not study anything technical and a few years ago i started to switch my career to software development okay that's right i love code who doesn't i love code okay coffee food and anime okay so for those watch anime hit me up okay um other than that i i'm dutch i was born and raised in amsterdam and yeah that's it that's pretty much it yes yes yes and she's a cool beast that's what she is okay there we go let's take a look at what you're going to be building guys are

amazon 2.0 check this one out oh it's so good oh [ __ ] so good so good this is what you'll be building we've built this already for you but the coolest part about this is and this is the the actual product page the coolest part about this by the way these are all inspired by dribble dribble um uh dribble creators if maybe a monologue you can help me out and actually include those dribble creators in the chat in the description that would be amazing these are amazing dribble creators if you just go to dribble.com you'll see what their names are please let me know so i can put them up

you're able to become a developer unraveling the myths behind becoming a developer how to get started with code and how to build and host your own portfolio online okay all right so really quickly as well very important guys this has never been done before or it hasn't been done you know in a long time let me ask you this who is sick of just online stuff who is sick of these online things not seeing people not going anywhere who's sick of that i know what happened who is sick of that raise your hand me me me a lot of people i know me too me too so what we are doing this is this is our first javascript conference javascript tour 2021 that's right this is our first conference but we will bring all that we know in terms of how we bring to the challenges but now into our inperson event it's a first inperson event it is happening in los angeles california from august 6 to august 8th every single day between 9 a.m and 5 p.m pacific time standard time okay we have already the venue booked near lax airport right it's all set up we're going to have guest speakers for example we're going to have a ceo we're going to have the ceo hackernoon come on in and become a guest speaker we'll have a few other guest speakers come in talk about so many topics guys you will get to learn things like i mean besides just learning now what's the most important thing about these conferences is one what is it well part part of it is networking networking that's right oh let me see not working you will be part of an amazing community right you will learn some upcoming technologies like for example typescript oh it's all disappearing it's okay like for example typescript right like for example tail and css right like for example you know react.js will have amazing workshops with react.js with tail and css typescript we will have amazing workshops and guest speakers come in and talk about their opportunity we'll have mastermind workshops for example where you guys get the chance to work on your mindset right mastermind workshops we will have workshops around money so as a developer how do you actually make money and how do you reinvest that money right so investing money and so much more but the most important is that this is not this just covers like the nothing of it okay jesse what's some of the most important things that we'll learn from this i think the most important thing is to see that once you learn code all of the beautiful things that are possible for you all the beautiful technologies the tailwind the typescript the you know those are all frameworks but we're also going to be talking about you know what's artificial intelligence what's you know other technologies hardware basically getting you guys introduced to the world of technology and especially this is so important when you want to make a career switch into software development let's say no because i often see people very focused only on programming learning the language itself but actually not knowing what you can really really do with it how cool would it be you started programming for example and suddenly you realize wow i could make a virtual reality game i could do game development i could you know invent the next alexa stuff like that you know and that's really important with these kind of conferences to get openminded to broaden your horizon basically and meet likeminded people of course most important thing guys is going to be your connections that you meet on here okay there will be over 100 people at the event so basically what i'm trying to say here say here is be there because the thing is the connections you make are the most important important things you do in life for example for me right the way i became who i am is because the connections that i have all of my jobs that i had as developer were because of the connections that i have right even being here clever programmer to teach you right now right to have all these courses to have the boot camps it was all because the connections that i had okay connections are the key and this might be the missing link in your career up and coming careers developer you guys might be struggling you guys i think figuring out hey how do i just keep going how do i just keep doing this well the what's missing link here is you just don't know every do not know anybody let me ask you this who does not know anybody right now around development recording so many people look at this but yet you want to go into that field how does that work out right you want to go into that field but yet at the same time you don't know anybody in that field raise your hand if you agree with me that if you want to go somewhere you have to find people who are already there and learn from them do you agree with that do you agree with that 100 that's right so let me ask you this anybody here interested in coming the javascript tour maybe you're in los angeles maybe you're in a different state raise your hand if you're interested in coming to the tour raise your hand nice a lot of people a lot of people great great great so we only have a few tickets left we only have a few tickets left okay um we'll go ahead and

have the tickets linked on youtube as well thank you all right yes okay cool let's go and continue on so a few things i want to talk about uh so three things important to you the money let me ask this question i want to put in the chat what are the three things important more important to you than money what are the three things tell me tell me time food family food family family nice creating religion okay fun good health peace god okay family chilling nice a lot of family i see a lot of family i agree with that okay let's not there's some weird ones too there's some weird ones too right doing what you love that's a big one i agree with that one right so you know for me for example jesse what is the three things that more important to you than money let me ask you that jesse make an impact on the world okay i'm doing what i love and be creative so impact yes impact right do what you love what you love right being creative creative for me for example you know for me it's doing what you love is a big one for sure it's actually in family family friends relationships relationships honestly i think if that's the only thing i have in life that's all i need honestly doing what doing what i love and the familyfriend relationship that's all i need honestly um so then i'm covered you know life is complete i can die and i'm just kidding but don't say that dude i'm kidding i'm kidding of course so what can what can making money as developer help you achieve in your life let me ask you that question now put that in the chat now okay okay let me see what can making money is developer jesse what can making money developer achieve may help you achieve in your life let me ask you well for me and everyone's christian careers um one thing and it's also one of the most important values in my life i guess is freedom so so money is equal to freedom but also i like doing the remote working style as a developer being able to work from home or from any place that i want to work with who that i who i want you know um yeah basically flexibility that'll be cool to go from anywhere in the world that to me is the best if you if you had the chance to work from anywhere in the world who would love that yeah i know i know that would be amazing that would be amazing i'll thank you guys because i live in amsterdam but i work with the guys who are based in l.a absolutely look at how that goes that works that right there breaks the barrier you're thinking hey you know what but i'm in this country and i don't have any jobs in this country that by the way just breaks the barrier fully okay in that there's jobs everywhere now and because of the internet you can technically be at that place as well so it breaks that barrier for you so easily okay guys nice okay financial freedom support your family right having more time to spend with your loved ones these are these are so such important things now let's figure out your income goals okay how much income do you want to make per month as a developer okay let me ask you that question i'll have something a lot tenth day per month guys let's be realistic guys now don't don't tell me a hundred thousand dollars per month okay that's not realistic okay adrienne are we reaching for the stars let me say as much as jeff bezos okay so uh jesse what's a good income income per month when you when they start out when developers start out tell me um i think it depends a little bit where you live for example so i know that californian software developers might earn more than on the east coast um but european software developers earn even more than american ones not always really you guys what depends depends where you work that's what you want that's not cool it depends what's funny when you work as a european for an american company in europe then that's when you earn more somehow anyways um so it depends where you live first of all guys second is um what's a good start well if you're doing first if you're being hired as an intern that's of course very different from if you're being hired as a full stack junior developer of course that's right that's right that's right that's right so i think you know more about it give me give me a number just just give me a number i think 50k dollars it would be a good start 50 to 70k dollars annual income annually so that would per month that would be around probably three thousand to four thousand a month okay yeah three thousand a month okay okay thank god per month okay so 4 000 per month okay is is a good average income you might start out with as you become more of a student developer you're looking to increase that you know 5k 6k 7k i know ten thousand dollars to fifty thousand dollars just developers making three hundred thousand dollars per year yeah that's an income that's possible do you want to freelance or full time that's a good question there's freelance okay and there's full time what's your decision let me ask you that freelance or full time free lens for lens or maybe even both maybe you want to do both maybe you want to do both like jesse what would you what do you like about what do you like most both but i like freelance a little bit more okay so you like both but you like freelance why is that so this is the thing there's always i always say like you know a coin always has two sides right if you're a freelancer that's great you got all the flexibility you can do whatever you want basically but it also sometimes means you have to work 24 7 and also acquire clients yourself however when you do when you're working fulltime in office the clients come to you well if your company is doing good right um and then you're working there plus you have a team you have a support you have you know teammates you can learn from when you're freelancing you're often by yourself unless you create your own team but when you start out as a freelancer that's often not the case okay so it depends a little bit i like to combine it um freelance for me would be more like a hobby that just pays me you know doing something for fun and then get paid for it but um yeah so there are there's just depends on what your lifestyle is and what you like that's right that's right that's right a lot of people are saying full time i'm looking at a chat right now a lot of people are saying full time a lot of people saying um okay a lot of people by the way tutorial if you guys look at the tutorial tutorial is going to begin tomorrow guys today is the opportunity to become a developer okay guys all right let's see both both freelance both both both yeah of course there's ups and downs with with either so with freelance it's awesome because that gives free that's freedom i see this as more of a freedom role where you can work from anywhere you want you decide when you want to go out we decide when you want to stop work but the issue with that is you're pretty much working every single day like it's not easy to get clients it's not easy to actually you know uh be someone who's credited that takes time like to be somebody who on upwork makes a lot of money that takes time so i want to want you guys to be realistic with this at the same time okay don't think that you can be on the beach coding and making a [ __ ] ton of money you know uh but and that's it it doesn't work that way it's it's [ __ ] hard okay and i'll just i'm i'm looking that following i'm using the file language too because for a purpose because i want to say that you know what this is actually really hard okay full time also really hard but with full time the cool thing is is you can get a job as a developer and even as a junior developer and you can be learning amongst a lot of people you see that's the thing with freelancers you're pretty much on your own that's the only issue that i have with that so your opportunity to become developer in 2021 okay what do we know about what do we know jesse okay well we know a few things we know the fact that a web developer position are growing like crazy right since 2014 i mean if you look at this the tech industry has always been booming and it's still booming to this day and it's not going to stop we know that for sure okay well developers computer jobs all jobs in general look at this all jobs are booming seven percent computer jobs are booming at 12 with developer jazza booming 27 and what are you guys learning here javascript html css tailwind css it is what is it jesse it is web development web development exactly okay look at this a thou one million more jobs than students by 2020 what does this mean whoa there's a lot more so think about the list it's like this is this is what this means there's demand uh one the demand is high yeah demand is high the supply is low supply is low okay yeah supply of developers so anybody know her economics anybody know economics anybody who knows economics what happens if the supply is low but demand is high what happens who knows put in the chat what happens then price goes up that's right this means this together this together means price and when i say price i mean your income goes up dramatically that's what happens when the supply is low demand is high the price goes up like crazy that's right so we look at it as well this means that there is a 500 billion opportunity 1.4 million competing jobs and only 400 000 computer students to computer science students so that is not a lot comparably that means your income will just keep going up and up and up comprehending plus you don't need to study computer you don't need to be a computer science student in order to become a developer that's right that's right nowadays you don't need nowadays you can go into a bootcamp developer nowadays you can start on your own and be a developer either one works okay here are some software engineers salaries guys that that work here we have soft engineering salaries in the us and again i'm suggesting us just for the purpose of you know because we're in us but um this is since january 2021 we've got ios developers making over 122 thousand dollars this is average by the way it's just average wow yeah yeah yeah android 121 000. look at this javascript developers 31 right there 112 dollars and again this is average i know people who are making more than this i know people who are making two hundred thousand dollars but i also know people who are making sixty thousand dollars and fifty thousand dollars right so there's there's two sides of the coin the better you get as developer then what happens the battery gas developer the more knowledge you know the more experience you have what happens to your income boom boom it goes up of course right so but it's up to you to make it happen it's not up to anybody else besides who you okay you i know somebody said php's still there i know it's right oh my god no php honestly php is still not bad i i still did code with php with laravel uh it's still a pretty good framework every time i mention php though you you crack up i know i just i don't like it but it's there okay it's there and it works okay next up remote work during clover 19 look at this 62 percent of us employees are working from home due to cove 19. 62 guys 62 percent wait do you hear anything by the way yeah i don't know what that is somebody's airco or something i got this i got this i got this okay no everybody's muted all right i'm back okay now it's better yeah it's better now great so 60 percent facebook apple all these companies say you know what no need no need for an office who loves working remotely anybody adrian says i love it working in pajamas is awesome i know i do too i do too i'm working remotely right now i mean i'm attacking an office here but i'm working from my home right now that's right so why javascript is something that's a good question why javascript anybody here knows why javascript who knows why javascript well i have a very simple answer for it because i love it and because i think you should love it too it's as simple as that okay it's as simple as that so why do you love it nice i don't know it's just so good you know it's just like it's like but what makes it so good then because you cannot just love something because it's sure you can why not it's just so good who says i love it too but yeah i just like it i like it but yeah so why do you why do you love a jesse here's a good question why do you like it jesse so what i like about javascript is that um syntax is compared to other programming languages like c or java it's pretty um what's the english word um it's like a language like a natural language normal language okay that said at the same time you know what i noticed with python for example um if you do things in python you don't really know what's happening under the hood but with javascript you are able to find that out so i think working with javascript therefore gives you so much more control and of course i love working with react and react is working with the components and how the components render out that's also actually how my brain works how to design an app so that's why i love working with javascript because it makes me allows me to use react actually yeah i like i like it because it's visual that's it that's why i like it i like it because yeah that's why i like it okay yeah yeah so most used programmers this out so most use programming language among developers worldwide javascript right there boom okay then instead we have html css i would not consider this a programming language but i guess it still is so there you go html css we have sql python java csharp and so forth right now the reason why this is becoming so popular is because actually javascript is starting to get used to for a lot it because it's not only used for web development it's also used for the following it's also used for things like um mobile development right right so ios android right so ios ios and also android okay and that is very popular if you can build using javascript for ios and android you're solid my friends you're solid next thing we have this is a stack overflow survey which is the biggest survey in the world around developers and look at this right there it just shows you right there javascript html css the top languages right there easy web frameworks react.js so we focus a lot on reactgs as well that's the biggest framework that we like to focus on because it's also one of the most biggest ones that people use right now okay so here's a good question what can you do with javascript answer that in the comment below what can you do with javascript roman says everything take over the world games that's a very good one monique that's right games that's right that's right that's right fly the moon well i mean you can try that too blockchain blockchain yes blockchains build on node.js i believe interactive animation websites so here's some tech companies using this linkedin we have a facebook i mean pretty much anything that you see on the web is just using javascript ebay tesla coupon netflix google uber paypal abb those are all companies who are using you know javascript okay next one let's see okay web apps for example like web apps like facebook ios and android so actually i have a tesla app right here and this desktop is actually built with react native it's on your iphone but it's built with react native which i think is so cool right then we have server apps which are netflix apps so for example who knows what a server app is anyone know what a server app is what's a server app compared to computer like for example i was an android app a server app what is it what is the server app jesse or nevermind so a server app and then sorry i was checking the chat i'm sorry oh good i'm good so a server app for example is for example if you were to use node.js okay let me go ahead and make sure this node.js okay so this is a framework with javascript and so this is all the behind the scenes stuff that's going on you know behind netflix so we have the front of netflix which i believe is actually built with react gs the front of netflix right it's actually blue with build with react gs but the back end of netflix is built with no gs this is where all the database is stored right this is where all the logic when you log in log out that is where all of that is happening right this because server app is taught basically the front end is talking to the server app and the server app then is talking to the front end all the time right and that is of course built with javascript the myths of becoming a developer right do i need to have a degree to get a job as a developer what do you guys think what do you guys think what do you say no no no no no no no no no that's right no no no no no hello why are you playing cricket i don't know because it's a no so no you do not need to have a degree to get a job most of my friends who are developers do not have any degrees they just they got the job because they're just good if you're good at what you do that's all that matters that's right honestly that's it okay so this is what we talked about if for example we have um google right so google for example do i need a computer science is good to have a google software engineer no a cs degree is not required for most of our software engineer or product manager roles it says it right there that's from google okay this is a this is from reddit it says i'm selftaught no degree whatsoever i didn't have a problem lending a job in microsoft regardless with a few years of mostly plus plus experience under my belt would wouldn't even say it was hard and no one at work had asked me if i have a degree ever since the first that first interview now that's nothing technically speaking oh you know but for what it's worth i've had recruiters from google facebook amazon try to learn me over as well so like i said just it's possible so this is what we say for certifications we don't like these okay let me ask you this did anybody come here for a certification did you guys come here for a certificate i hope not because you're not getting one where i hate them that's right you're not getting a certificate certificate okay nobody needs a certificate okay nobody needs a certificate here that's right i came for the challenge you came here for what why did you come here give me a reason why did you come here guys why expand my brain to learn something to learn gain knowledge you have friends to build projects that's amazing guys learn learn learn that's right yes right your powerful thing guys you have yes he's autographed maybe you should come to the inperson event to do that so to gain knowledge guys this is why you're here for knowledge it is the most important thing this knowledge is we like to call it very simple knowledge is power no nas it's not yes it is no it's not okay what is jesse i'm sorry okay what is it jesse then applied knowledge is powerful dang let's go jesse okay okay jesse's hidden okay let's go i acknowledge his power because this is the thing guys often we learned in school or maybe your parents used to say this knowledge is power okay so you start reading a lot of books you start watching a lot of documentaries or anything however if you only read the books but you don't apply the theory of the knowledge of that book on your own projects or on your life guess what nothing changes doesn't nothing happens doesn't matter so that's not the real power knowledge is not power applied knowledge is power who here let me ask this who here has learned something new learn something new okay and have wanted to get into something maybe you've wanted to get into coding but you've never actually done it you've read the books you've started maybe if you're watching a video but you never actually did it a lot i know a lot of people that's right why why why because you can learn all you want but unless you actually apply it to the real world it does not matter whatever you learn here in this let me tell you this the unfortunate truth is the following fifty percent of you here in this challenge are going to watch it and then that's the only thing you're gonna do fifty percent of you are going to do that and that's a very unfortunate truth but that's just real world the other 50 are actually going to apply what they've learned they're going to take the knowledge they have here they're going to do something about it or they're going to take it to the next level maybe they'll use what they learned here and maybe the next thing you know maybe they'll maybe get some more training and they keep going at it they keep doing the same thing they keep learning more things other people will just be like oh great i did this that's it that's all i need so let me ask you this are you the other 50 are you the 50 that's going to be just using this and that's it and you're done are you the 50 that's you know what no i'm gonna take what i learned from here and then i'm gonna take it to the next step which one are you which one are you let me ask you that i'm gonna take it and build on it awesome jason that's right that's right i'm really serious about this because i talk to a lot of students and ver the unfortunate truth is they say oh no as you know i'm not ready for this right now i'm not ready for you know maybe a coding course or even a boot camp i'm not ready for to learn anything to you know that's that's outside my league well you know basically what what you're saying if you're saying that you're saying what that means let's say you're not serious about what you're trying to do it also means you're not ready to change your life even though you should be changing it maybe at that point because otherwise why would you be here wanting to learn something that's right that's right somebody said not ready is delaying forever have you ever thought to yourself hey you know what oh yeah i'll do this later oh yeah i'll do this later i'll do it later later and then later just never becomes the truth never becomes forever raise your hand if you've done that i've done it too i've done it too yeah i've done it everybody's done it yeah guilty of charge me too the thing is though guys you know what procrastination actually is procrastination is not about you not being ready you not being motivated enough you not having the money or you not having the will or the power or the sleep or the energy or whatsoever that's not what procrastination is procrastination is actually a coping mechanism that comes in when we're dealing with stress guess what changing your life yes can be [ __ ] stressful guess what it's also worth it so once i noticed for myself for example that i used to procrastinate on stuff i knew like okay i should not procrastinate on it i have to step into the fear and do it immediately and this is the moment right like who's that guy marcus aurelius says it right fear is often about 99 scenarios you have in your head but none of them is actually true right so once you realize that and once you practice that guys and once you you know be comfortable with being uncomfortable and going into that step going into that fear that's when you will change your life but you gotta go move forward okay somebody said it's a daunting talk to get your [ __ ] together basically that's it that's worth it that's it so that's what i like to say you know for me a lot of times and sometimes yes it is hard sometimes yes it is can be difficult and it's scary but what isn't scary what isn't scary anything that it's new is going to be fearful is going to be scary it's going to be something on the unknown we as human beings we are driven by a few things right here the few things we are driven by we are driven by what we are driven by uh when we have uh safety right we are driven by when we have uh not not direction but we are driven by um not competence what isn't when we're consistency we like consistency don't don't we we like consistency right but we are also driven by differentiation we're driven by new things growth and your brain by default is there for this your brain by default is to keep you safe and to keep you doing consistent things that's what your brain is there for anything outside that creates fear is the reason why is because your brain is telling you no it is not safe it is something new it is not consistent we haven't done this before so no no let's go ahead and scream and let's uh be scared that's what happens that's just the truth but the truth is this is what's stopping a lot of us this is what stopped me i'm guessing it was was maybe stopped jesse at some point too maybe not i don't know jesse but it stopped me at some point okay i'm not perfect okay but i mean of course everybody has been there you know um because that's the thing guys when you do something that changes your life or that is a little bit scary maybe even not changing your life but just a little bit you know um what not says right the little voice comes in and the little voice tells you no actually don't become a software developer because you're earning more money now at the job that you're at now even though you don't like it you're earning more money and if you become a software developer again you have to start from scratch you have to invest a lot of energy in it a lot of money yeah you know you should just stay where you are yeah yeah but there's this other voice in your head and that goes off like but i'm not happy at my current job i think i could be happier i love code i actually love creating things i don't see why i cannot do this and then the fight starts that's right you know and that's you struggling and getting over that wall to get outside of your comfort zone yeah some of the scariest things for me were for example quitting my job you know the scariest thing for me was talking in front of a lot of people the scariest thing for me heck even asking a girl on a date for me was scary right but it had to be done you know but it had to be done right but through all that that's where the result comes around right that's where the result comes around when you for example anything new when you go into college or maybe when you go learning a new piece of technology maybe you're learning how to ride a bicycle it's going to be scary and there's a reason for it okay but that is okay and i want all of you to understand that what i like to do is instead of being scared you know what that's fearful in my mind i'm like you know what no i'm going to go into it if it's fear that i fear i actually do the opposite i paired it up i make the assumption the following if it's fearful i do it and so if you just keep doing it fear equals do i mean don't do it don't do anything crazy stupid okay don't just go jumping you know or something just let's also when you come here you're going to go skydiving with us 100 by the way okay but fear equals do i start to pair that in my life with fair equals do my parents for example at 35 years old they completely changed their life they stopped everything they had in ukraine and they came to america imagine restarting your life from zero they came to america with five hundred dollars guys and they're in cash that's it that's all they had they sold everything they had in ukraine they saw everything they had in ukraine and they came here how's that right and they literally came here to a country where they did not know the language they did not know anything my dad was working 18 hours a day cleaning clean cars at a car wash my mom was cleaning houses that's the only job they could get at that point but because of them it is the reason why i am here the reason why i now have a sister right it is the reason why now i can teach you it is a reason why you know i've been able to learn so much and become a developer and become a great developer hard working person because i've realized that the hard work and fear is just part of the game and now to me and i because of the example that my parents have set for me i have nothing else but you know but to thank them for what they've done because it is not easy to be 35 years old and to restart to hit a restart on your life in a new country though you can't even speak that's right some you said salma that's right my parents came here to give us a better life the reason there's a reason why they do that to give us a better life so for a lot of you here you guys might be here because you want to give your kids or your future a better life raise your hand that's you am i right isn't isn't that a good intention so let's look at so let's make it happen let's just [ __ ] do it because somebody has to go through it somebody has to go through the troubles and tribulations and let that be us and that's fine all right guys are you with me here are you with me are you with me beautiful i love it let's go all right awesome i just got deep that's cool yeah i mean i mean it's how we set the tone also for this challenge guys like are you [ __ ] in or what because actually this challenge of course is about coding of course it's also about fun but it's also about how are you going to take the next step in your life how are you going to make code you know work for you how are you know um i studied law i changed careers and you know it just seemed like a career switch but it was not just about that it was about i want to live my life on my terms i want to create the life that i want to live okay and so that's also why you guys should be in this challenge and feel that you know embrace that power that you have and work for it to gain it basically okay so that's why this is so important to talk about and to overcome the fears that come in the little voices to get out of your comfort zone and i always have i'm not going to talk about this much more but i have one question for you all what's the real prize if you're not going to go into coding what's the real price now a lot of people only think about the money that they're missing out on or you know because they're changing job from a higher salary not wanting you know becoming a software intern but it's about what's the real price and often that's happiness that's health that's creativity that's freedom which is just as valuable as money to some point or even more okay so let's continue i love it i love it that's it and somebody said joseph king said can i learn coding while studying medical school 100 yes you can't 100 hell yeah i have a really good combo i have a student right now who is actually working right now as a doctor no she's i forgot doctor no i'm not a doctor in the medical field anyways and she's also she's also in her boot camp and she's literally she has the coaching call like it's not no joke she opens up the cultural on her in the zoom on her phone right she puts an airpods into her uh you know he puts in airpods and then she then she just works and she listens like because that's her job right but but she's doing it she's killing it right so there you go awesome sweet so this is what you know for example this is what uh elon musk even said for example right so you can't successful in life without you can't succeed in life without a degree that's why you need schooling if you want to go to harvard yamas says that's not true don't confuse schooling with education i didn't go to harvard but but the people that work for me did right so like i said it doesn't really matter right same thing elon musk do you still stand firmly on requiring college degrees are not at not requiring character he's like yes right there right so just a few examples so don't do a degree guys that's not the most important thing right if you don't do not have a degree uh salary i'll look we're looking i mean it just keeps going up and up and up and it will keep going up because there's a lot more demand than the supply okay and here's the breakdown again this is for the entry level software engineers for example you know spacex tesla you know crews these are some example companies there's a ton of companies out there you can go and check it out spacex for example you know average sale is around 170 thousand dollars tesla 157k south engineer 216 000 so yeah if you're really good if you're competent in what you do yes these numbers are not crazy honestly like they're not crazy when you are competent at what you do so here's an example i mean cause himself who knows kazi raise a man raise your hands who knows cause he here you guys know kazi right and you guys know cozy that's right he himself has dropped out of college he himself did not go to college and he just instead decided to learn by himself do freelancing and then build a business like clever programmer here right and teach everybody else so that's just one example another example look at this look at this who's this anybody know this girl i don't know this girl who knows this girl anybody hope you guys do but this is jesse this is me um studied law in amsterdam okay um actually i studied law because i didn't know what i wanted to become well there you go so um working a few years as a text law consultant okay and then i realized at my first job they asked me to survey a tax newsletter and guess what i had to program that newsletter in the html css that's right that's right that's right that's where i fell in love with code realizing i love that part of my job but i hated the [ __ ] rest loves code there we go there we go that's all she needed she just loves to cook and now she's a geeky and a nerdy coder there you go and that is okay i was always a dirty i was born to be a coder um so yeah so you know um after that um going to meetups uh learning code on my own um never you know but having a hard time finding communities in that time you know most of it was online um so of course free code camp or code academy or tutorials but that didn't get me any further um long story short um i just tried some things out and i landed an internship and i did it on my on my own you know so yeah basically i think that muscle makes me a strong teacher actually because i learned it from scratch i learned it the hard way the soft way the medium way whatever way um you guys wherever you failed i feel too and i got back up okay so i think that makes me a good teacher in the sense of uh i know what it takes um to learn code from scratch um and how you can learn it better and faster and uh make it work for you that's okay that's right that's right but the most important part guys and when all of this is mindset you know being a good developer is about being a good communicator and having the right mindset okay so so let's keep on i have another example here robert he is a friend of mine great guy okay look at how good he looks so so robert right has an agree he's a good friend of mine and i actually work with him on trindala it's a startup company that he did with one of my another friend steve um i use them as an always example they were amazing mentors of mine he was a mentor of mine so will steve i love both of them and i still keep in touch with them to this day um yeah we both were doing this startup company turned out we were all doing this and you know he didn't have a degree he just kind of started this right and now he works at quicken loss which one of the biggest company look at this he's a team lead he's he's a team lead guys like he's a leader he's a senior developer who's a leader in his whole team at quicken loans and he has he's leading people who are you know a lot older than him and who even have degrees who have master's degrees doesn't matter he is just hard worker and he just loves what he does that's it period okay so the career ladder kind of looks like this you know you start with a junior developer in your position you start off with this amanda actually before this you might actually start up with an internship at first that might be the first thing you start so an internship might start out then you go into a senior developer position then go into a lead developer position a technical architect potentially a team lead which is think about that right he now is a team lead he is here now already wow and he's my age he's my age guys he's 25 25 years old that's right and he's tall as heck by the way anyways right and he's gonna be on the verge to becoming a cto at some point as well so also the javascript tour you guys we talked about so talked about this already uh link i think i told you about the link already at this point if you guys are still interested in doing the javascript tour to meeting a lot of amazing people networking and connecting together let me put the link again yeah the link is also below in the youtube at the youtube description okay if you guys have youtube open it's also there awesome uh that's right you're never too old guys that is correct okay i just put the link guys i'll just put a link if you guys are interested in joining the javascript or if you did the javascript tour if you just joined the javascript tour please let me know in the chat dm me that would be amazing dma here in the zoom chat i would love to see who did it and so i can actually call you and actually talk to you that'll be amazing um also one last thing guys i want to talk about is actually something called the graduation graduation call so we have a graduation call basically we will be talking about your next roadmap towards becoming a developer we're talking about you know how you did at the boot camp or at this challenge okay we're talking about how you can improve and maybe you know what are some troubles and tribulations you had and how you can work on those so for those for everybody here you guys every single person here gets gets a graduation call with one of our team members it's a oneonone call between me between jesse for example you might get jesse you guys might get me you might get for example uh luke is another great guy um he might actually be here in the call as well you might for example get uh frankie as well frankie right so let me go ahead and make this right so i call this the graduation call okay five day challenge five day challenge a graduation call very important guys okay very important day basically your roadmap ah come on nas find a challenge do you have the link for that by the way which link the graduation call yes let me check okay let's go this is going to be your roadmap for becoming a developer we'll talk about how you did in the challenge how you did during the challenge and we're doing this this for only two three days august 2nd through august 4th okay how you did during the challenge how you can improve improve improve your reach your goals your goals okay this is only for people with the way who've joined the actual challenge if you're on youtube unfortunately we can't do that but if you have joined the challenge okay click the link below and we'll help you join the challenge okay but if you're on youtube unfortunately you just can't do that so how how you can improve and reach your goals that's going to be the whole goal of this graduation call and of course we'll congratulate you on actually you know fully graduating uh from this challenge okay so link link in chat guys okay so right now everybody i want okay so

set up very important guys this is your graduation call so i want everybody to be on there okay we want to talk to we want to talk to every single one of you i think this will be amazing just to see and then you know what you guys did and how you guys did it and what's been going on okay okay let's go ahead and get it started all right oh let's go so we talked about this so what's the first step you should take towards becoming a developer guys right really good question well what do i need to do to pass the interview how do i get noticed and how many interviews do i need to do right so let's do that before this you need to learn before all this the most important thing you guys need to do is what very simple it is to learn to code okay you need to gain that knowledge first before anything else honestly like we said knowledge always comes first knowledge is gonna be your key knowledge is your your key guys okay knowledge is your key all right all right go ahead i see daniel okay just message me okay let's go and continue on question how to learn to code that's a good question how do you learn to code well first things first is we need to simplify the journey because the journey is honestly not that hard guys okay let me ask you this how are you learning to code right now okay what are the ways that you're learning to code put them down the chat i'm very curious what are the ways that you are learning to call someone say you've done me somebody said how else somebody said by doing practice that's right pwj youtube fsm nice full stack mastery by project youtube youtube youtube coding apps documentation courses codecademy udemy reputation that's right so what i want you guys to do is very simple number one let's set a longterm goal okay which is this one the longterm goal is become a fullstack developer in one to five years okay that's our longterm goal raise your hand if you want to become a fullstack developer here raise your hand anybody yes good i got i judge i see you guys i see everybody yes that's right right now the shortterm goal is what a lot of people don't tell you this is the unfortunate truth that a lot of people don't tell you you think that you need to build crazy products here's what you think you think that in order to get to this you need to do the following you need to do build crazy project you need to really just say you're there yeah okay i am here okay good build crazy projects you're building crazy products you need to for example learn a bunch of technologies a bunch of technologies like you need to learn so many technologies right you need to learn all these technologies right you need to you know you need to maybe you know um let me see let's see you need to learn node.js and you need to know react to yes and you need to know all these different you know like frameworks and angularjs and let me cut all that [ __ ] out from you okay let me just say this very simple just cross this out i know i know it's crazy i just crossed out for you because this is the reason why you're not an actual developer period you think that you just need to keep doing more youtube you think that you need to keep doing more udemy courses you think you just need to keep doing more and more and more and more and more of the stuff that does not [ __ ] work oh are we stuck where we where i think we're stuck at if you're doing the same thing of the thing that doesn't work then you're just doing the same thing it doesn't work it doesn't change yes deborah said it tutorial hell that's right you my friends are in tutorial help but it's not just that you're in the hell in general okay that's right because you yourself if i just give you is very simple problem right now and i said to you hey you know what create for me a function that will merge to a race together could you do that right now or hey can you for example build a binary search tree or can you for example just even build a project from scratch can you do that right now like i build a car before yourself by now some of you you have that knowledge and maybe yes you can because you've done that before but some of you you're like oh hell no i know what you're talking about that's right reason being is because what you guys don't have unfortunately is the following is this the fundamentals it's like for example if i told you to build a house what is the first thing that you build when you build a house what is it it's what is the foundation and yes it's the foundation of the house if you've got no foundation whatever happens your house will collapse by about your house will collapse right so i take this very seriously i take this problem only very very seriously right and some of you for example and here's what you told maybe hey you know what you need to learn html you need to learn css and uh you know this is so important and all this stuff and yeah html css yeah that will make your developer uhhuh uhhuh yeah this is what's important right here uhhuh learn this spend two months learning this okay hell no as well also cross this [ __ ] out you don't need none of that okay let me tell you that i don't know what kind of voice that was that was really interesting that was the first time i did that before now is you okay sometimes i don't know maybe it's a movie that i i heard or something right but you don't need that guys this my friends is not a programming language it is not i can teach you html css in literally two days i can teach you guys a whole html css and i'm not kidding in probably three days over you actually being a challenge and if i focus focus only on html css that's what you will learn your best way to learn html css is just for practice and nobody have you ever seen on the actual for example on an in not an interview but for one have you ever seen anybody ask an interview about html css maybe there's like one or two people nope no hell no no have you ever heard anybody tell you hey you know what you need to learn to miss success and uh yeah you're gonna be asked about ishmael css uh as a requirement for a job a job requirement yeah yeah so important yeah that's right learn that right now no never i never had that maybe some of you have done it maybe you've seen it right it's i want to say never ever that doesn't make sense right never never that doesn't happen right but they don't focus on that what you need to what they are asking you is hey how can you actually problem solve and problem solving comes from what solving problems that's right that's right all this stuff is unnecessary boom it's very simple how can you problem solve it is very simple and problem solving comes with knowing these fundamentals it is comes from experience it comes from you practicing nonstop that's where that comes from okay guys so i want you guys to be very serious about this you guys have taken courses of html of css and i know a lot of you are there and let me tell you you don't need that let me save you your time and your money okay so what you need to know actually the fundamentals first right because if i ask you interview questions like around uh foundations around algorithms or on data structures it comes from you know how to promote it comes from you know the fundamentals of actually coding that's it right so here's what you guys to do okay number one take out a piece of paper and a pen right now i'll be every single person right now okay take out a piece of paper and a pen right now i want you to write down the following or to write down that i want you to write down one one let me say this right now let me say this right now one write down i need to learn the fundamentals learn fundamentals right two i need to create projects on my own what does that mean you don't look at anybody else you don't look at youtube you don't look at you dummy no you create projects on your own on your own you figure out a good project you want to do you figure an idea and then you just do it okay it's sometimes things are as simple as just you just doing it that's it you can't escape it that's an unfortunate truth what what type of products to start out with what depends on what technology you know if you know javascript and you know html and css build a website build a website for example for maybe a company that you love build a website for maybe a specific restaurant that's right right anything that's right so fake it a good project there's actually some amazing products you can guess guys can take a look at i want you guys to take a look at a company called frontend mentor okay everybody right now i want you guys to check out a comical front end front front end mentor these guys these guys will show you projects to do okay go to their website that's right go to that website go to google.com type in frontend mentor and then you'll see all the projects that you can build they literally have the designs for you all you have to do is just build them and you build them and you have fun with it that's it guys simple as that okay and of course you make a plan so your plan should be the following one learn the fundamentals of javascript so look learn all the fundamentals around algorithms data structures right for example like things like what are some fundamentals that need to know jesse who do you know in order to start wealth with frontend mentor no for the mentors in general they need to learn no things like stacks right oh you mean data structures that's right stacks uh binary search trees um linked list of course queues um tries and maybe hash table or graphs but that's very advanced yeah i would say arrays just objects in general yeah okay i know for some of you it's like oh you know this stuff is not fun this stuff you don't actually need we're never going to use this in actual you know in in actual uh in real life you're right you're not like this kind of stuff you're not actually going to use unless you're doing really complicated stuff but what this stuff builds and this is actually crazy enough i realized this when i became a teacher i realized that the way the reason why i became such a good developer is because i know this stuff all this stuff that's the reason and i initially i was like oh that's a bunch of [ __ ] screw that nobody needs to learn this i'm never going to use this in real world and you're right you're not but this builds neurons a this kind of stuff makes you a good problem solver yes because you're always thinking you're always thinking okay how can i do this how can i do that how can i do this how can i use all these little tools that i have in my own tool belt to solve a problem and these are just simply the tools these are just the tools so i want you to be very careful that the reason why you learn this kind of stuff not because you're going to use it but it's because it's going to make it a better problem solver that's it honestly that is it that's the reason why i'm going to we're going to we're so focused on that so another really cool thing that we like to use is something called notion notion is a great company that we like to use as well for you know um for uh scheduling things or for creating tasks lists so go and check them out okay so sound important habits for you too for you to get there we i talk about this really simple it is really easy not easy but here's what i say fun i prioritize this a lot don't put if it's if you're tired uh you know at night and you feel like you don't want to code and maybe you just like you just just feel like you despise it later on then just don't code just don't worry about it instead figure out what's fun for you like let me ask you this like what in what way can you work that's fun put in the chat i know my way ways that i like to work that's fun like in what ways is your fun for you what what's the fun just i know those ways yeah you know those days for example somebody said music playing music playing music dancing while coding um i like to draw draw things out improve ideas um think of new features use pinterest or dribble um yeah well sometimes i watch twitch somebody said by making money somebody say cook watch twitch anime yeah for sure of course that's fun yeah so for example from me and again you will learn this you will learn this as you get better okay for me for example the way i like to work in a fun way is i actually like to go to coffee shops i don't drink coffee but i go to coffee shops so for example really cool for me is i like the environment i like to set myself a really good environment right so just going to coffee shops in general well there's a lot of people doing other stuff you know they're all maybe working you know by themselves you know they got this coffee it's like it's like this whole process you go to a coffee shop you know you get a coffee maybe you get a chai latte i like chai latte that's what i like because i don't i don't drink coffee so i'm gonna try i know i gotta try latte maybe give myself like a little cookie you know just to you know make myself feel good you know sometimes give myself a small sandwich they got there you know so good and i just take that and i go to i go to sit down i open my laptop i put on my headphones and i just work i just have fun honestly and i enjoy that i enjoy the crap out of that and that to me is fun so yes i would say prioritize fun because fun is what allows you to keep doing what you're doing fun okay so fun allows you to keep doing of course then we talk about hard work that's really important as well you know patience uh this you know these are some key terms you i'm sure you you know all of you guys know this is you just need to put this into actual perspective and actually use it uh team cooperation communication learning tick initiative very important i think on here is ticket initiative whenever you get the chance to actually work at a company i want you to remember this word take an issue i want you to write this on your piece of paper right now take all right take initiative take initiative all right okay take initiative this is very very very i would say extremely important as a developer also as in becoming a problem solver now i see a lot i talk to a lot of students and i see students behave a certain way often right when they start out and they want to become a problem solver they want to solve that problem however they ask me how do i solve this what's what's wrong here but they're they're that's the only thing they do they only ask me one question instead of you know going to google google it search it search on more ask the right questions write the right questions down get some clarity if they got some answers uh show the steps they've done to solve the problem and then come back to me and say like hey i have this problem this is the goal of my code but i have this problem and i tried this this this to solve it what direction should i go in a or b that's sometimes what i see um a lot of students lacking in they're not taking that initiative they think just asking the question hey my code doesn't work can you help me out they think that's initiative but that's not initiative real initiative is going out there you know trying to get what you want listen you don't have to know the answer but initiative is about making that effort to find out the answer would you rather have if you were a senior would you rather have a junior that just ask you hey my code doesn't work can you help me or would you rather have a junior asking you hey this is the goal of my code it doesn't work i tried this this and that can you help me out with this and that and that a lot better right that's right that's right so that's what taking initiative is about guys that's what that means that's right okay sweet so next up how to learn to code uh well there is how can i not so there's a few different mentalities i'd like to talk about there's the one mentality which is if you ever approach a problem which you guys will like it or not you can either be mad at your computer and just kill it and you know throw it outside the window and say why can i not solve this and be mad at yourself and be mad at the code or and i honestly i've done this before so so you know i can't blame you if you're in this in this and this too but but the verses is you're always thinking thinking about this thinking about how can i solve this right in your mind the question should be you know i prioritize a lot and i've been told this actually a lot where it's like i'm always in the mindset of okay there's a problem how can i solve it how how how i never limit myself thinking that i can't solve something if for example maybe you're in a bad situation right now maybe maybe you're not making money maybe you don't have a job right maybe you're tired and you just don't know what to do but can you get yourself out of that is there has let me ask you this question if you're in a certain position right now where you have a problem has there anyone asked yourself this has there anyone else that's been in the same position and they've solved that problem has anyone else done it maybe you don't know them but has anyone else done it yes am i right yes of course yes so if they did it could you do it too if they are the example could you do it too we have for example the borah says yes i had no job and i got a job not the job i want to but i'm working the board that's right see so you can always give yourself a situation and know sometimes it's really hard sometimes maybe you are just not capable or not able to get out your situation because you know maybe there's certain things limiting you maybe physically you're limited in a certain way but i'm i'm still sure i want you to keep thinking about how can i solve this i never want you to keep in the mindset of like i've given up and i can't do any more that's not a good mindset to have okay all right next up so full stack developer role map okay we know this at this point it involves a few things front end backend database devops mobile app the one thing i want you guys to focus on are these three database for the backend okay that's what makes a good developer from full stack developer okay so let's just go ahead and make that uh a focus all right next up again these technologies html css javascript that's going to be your frontend technologies like react.js together with firebase okay right here you guys can write this down kind of stuff down okay who knows this kind of stuff html css in javascript i always think this gives you is so much fun because it really explains actually um these languages you know or these frameworks i'm going to be this guy okay i'm going to be a javascript so i got you you're definitely that guy but then like then like two times faster like forward i don't i don't know how he does it he just like goes nuts he's just like yeah left right why can't he do that he does a little bit of cramping and then a little bit of boogie you know like yeah i got the most can i learn from him i like this i like this person anyways so of course the three main things html css javascript html what do you think what do you guys think that is that is the skeleton so if you're a person your skeleton is your structure it is your html okay so let's remember that okay your css is your presentation who here likes to dress up when i say dress up just look good okay who here let me know in the chat and it's okay because i like to i like to yeah i like to do it too hell yeah i like to got some nice shoes i got a nice jacket you know got some nice pants you know there we go i like doing that i don't care some people say it's my ego no it's not i just like it okay but anyways that's your css okay that's right that's your appearance okay then we got the javascript okay who here likes to take action who here likes to move who here just i mean if you're in general if you can just move your hands you're good or anything anybody right who here right i'm me i like to dance right anybody here likes to dance or anybody here likes to move around yeah me okay don't say that julian just dance that's right that's right that's the javascript portion of you okay the javascript it is your mind it is what makes you move the way you move right your mind tells you you know what step next step this step this that's right by the way guys if nas and i if we're having our coding sessions it often goes this way we play music and we're coding and dancing at the same time that's right that's that's how it always goes so uh with html what would like to talk about is of course learn the basics don't focus too much on the html it's amazing uh thing i want you to understand is this is not your main focus your main focus is going to be javascript which we'll talk about here in a second but with html make a page make it work don't over complicate it it's simple guys honestly you learn how to how to use a div h1 a p tag and that's [ __ ] it okay and then you learn some css literally please do not over complicate it if you are right now spending [ __ ] months on learning html css you're in the wrong position period all right okay so here's some basic things literally if i taught you this that's all you got to learn okay html header your body your body is basically this is what you actually see it has things like h1 tags so each one tags are headers okay so it's in my first web page that's going to be a header and p this is your paragraph tag and everything and then there's something called div which you don't see on here but it's like um it kind of looks like this let me show you yeah right here right here and these are building blocks that make everything inside your html work pretty much okay then we've got css again you know focus don't focus too much on that one as well learn how to use different layouts so for example like flexbox in this case we're going to learn how to use tail and css that's using flexbox as well so we'll learn how to do that in this session and not this session but in the next few days okay so guys it is prerequisite that you have some basic knowledge of css otherwise it's going to be really hard to follow along for the next few days so if you have some knowledge on css you're good to go honestly even if you don't it's okay okay because yeah no it's okay completely because uh for you guys if you don't know css that is all right basically you will be seeing the way we are doing this and then this will be sprinkling basically knowledge into you so it's kind of like i'm putting a seed into your brain uh like it's being exposed to it that's right you've been exposed to it that's the whole point of this you're being exposed to new technologies telling css html css javascript so do i need to know javascript no you don't no you don't okay you will be learning a lot of this kind of stuff on here and this will be a seed that will spread out and turn into a beautiful butterfly not a butterfly seeds don't butterflies don't go from seeds um that will turn into a beautiful flower or a tree okay that's what seeds are for okay one of my amazing teachers victoria she was a teacher of mine this teacher she always told me you know what does i'm just planting seeds in you and then what then you become a good dancer that's it and so that's what i like to do to my students as well so again this is some css examples i want to show to you guys so again if you do not know uh nate if you do not know html as well doesn't matter this is for complete beginners you will be all good guys okay it is for complete beginners you'll be all good don't worry about it guys okay this is some examples of css for example here you can see this is an a tag and we're targeting a an a tag an a tag is basically a link and we're saying hey display block we're going to give it a padding which is basically some spacing we're going to give it a text decoration i'm going to give it a color as well and on the hover of this a tag it's going to be a cursor pointer with a new color of red and now this might not make sense that's okay you will learn this on the fly of course now we get to javascript this is where it's real actually really hard or it gets harder html css is not as bad as what this is okay so this is where you'll be learning data types so for example um you know data types like what are some data types jesse well we talked about this before right the data structure so this would be the linked list well i should talk about data types so numbers oh sorry numbers um arrays booleans strings um variables of course um wow that that that light green yellow is really hard to read nice i know it's okay i can't change it object uh objects and that's about it i think yeah these are the main data that you need to learn and a lot of stuff you can actually learn go to codecademy go to free code camp a lot of stuff you will see actually on there okay so feel free to use those libraries or those learning resources of course learn functions es6 function is a little piece of code that you can utilize um to kind of repeat that same piece of code so for example let's say that you want to you have a one you have a function for you know maybe grabbing some data you can reuse that function multiple times right dom manipulation dom manipulation is what who knows what dom manipulation is let me know in the chat who knows what dom manipulation is anybody put in the chat okay but tell me what is it don't just tell you i do just tell me what is it though tell us michael curry that's right when they put the nodes of it that's right so of course html has nodes right so and the document has nodes right and so downward pushes but manipulating those nodes so they look different okay so for example maybe i click on something and i want something else to appear on the page right maybe i want to appear a dialogue that's called dom manipulation i'm adding a new piece of html into the dom okay scope who knows what scope is anybody anybody who knows the scope is it's a more advanced topic more that's right so a scope is kind of like this kind of like imagine you have a a piece of paper right right and your scope is like your score is i'm saying hey your scope is this piece of paper you can only look at that piece of paper or maybe i can say hey your scope is on this little section on a piece of paper and so you can only see that section so when we talk about scope we talk about we can actually see all the little variables or the little data that i have in my application that's scope and again we'll talk more about that later on then there is this this is the hard stuff guys okay this is the hard stuff a data structures slash algorithms and so what those are are are what what are they jesse we just talked about this but stacks and queues of course okay um binary search trees linked lists um double linked list because you have two kinds of linked lists okay singly and double and um tries hashtables i want to say about it yeah i want to say as well like for example graphs as well and so forth yeah graphs yeah yeah so these are your data structures and then of course you get your face api this is actually get stuff from an api yeah that's right there's a hash you'll you'll see a hash table is uh it's just a very complicated way of mapping data you'll see a hash table actually consists of two types of data structures that's right i believe yeah that's right so this is an example of some javascript this is yeah i mean yeah this is pretty complicated but what's gonna happen here this is an array you guys can see this what do you guys think this is what what is this so this is an array what do you think this is anybody can guess what this is what is this that's right christopher this is an object it's an object okay who knows what this is what this what is that it's a key that's right this is a key and then what what is this right here value value right so an object has multiple keys and multiple values and i can actually reference them okay who knows for example what uh you know what is this right here filter function that's right it's a filter function that's actually already accessible for us that's right it's a filter function right and we can actually use it in our a piece of code as we don't have to create it it's already there for us by javascript that's right so that's right that's what we talk about let's talk about some frameworks so of course knowing javascript is your foundation it is your fundamentals okay but you cannot just stop there unfortunately right so nasa seems like you're not sharing your screen on youtube all right oh dang thank you jesse right there my bad yeah that's okay right there that shallow script alrighty right there hey okay sometimes forget that dang it i know why but sometimes i just forget that um so yeah there you go thank you guys by the way um so frameworks of course right these are most important things javascript can only take you so far at that point once you've learned javascript once you learn the basics then you have to actually learn the frameworks okay and what are those well you guys know that we have frameworks like angular so i actually started with angular my first framework was angularjs okay and imagine a framework it's kind of like it's kind of like the embassy hmm it's kind of like the engine imagine if a car right it's kind of like a car no imagine like this imagine a framework it's like you know how you have a house you know a house right a house is a house and then you have rooms imagine the framework is like the room so you can create the rooms and make it fancy that's what the framework allows you to do it makes it very easy for you okay so that's what that is that's angular we have vue.js which is another javascript uh framework and then of course we got react gs right here that's react.js for you right there okay beautiful and here are some companies who are using these technologies we've got for example you know angularjs oh right here oh wait wait right here used by companies like the guardian upwork paypal sony that's angular vigi oh yeah people in angular okay yeah airbnb instagram eats dropbox also for example facebook the new facebook is built with react.js of course because they made reactions also netflix yeah netflix is a big one that's right uh view gs alibaba grammarly you know dashboard gitlab and so forth right a lot of companies so what should i choose there's a lot of options you can you can honestly choose either you want to use vue.js go ahead there's going to be companies who are looking for that you want to use you know angular go ahead there are companies looking for that doesn't matter honestly for example for me i got a job at a company without really knowing react.js i got a i became a react.js developer without knowing react.js seriously i went to a company they're like nas but you don't know right yes you're right i don't know but i'm a good problem solver so you can either like me or you don't you know they send me like they literally send me these all these interview questions and they send me a test to do around a reg gs i completely flopped it completely failed they're like yeah you probably should learn some more reactions i'm like yeah that's fine i can probably learn erect on the job you know i learned i can learn on the job like oh okay okay okay and then they hired me you know and then i was making 10k a month right so there you go and then and then i learned react gs with them that's it the most important thing you need to learn is just pick one so the one that we usually go with is we just do react because it's one of the simpler ones to kind of learn it's there's not a lot of headache too much you know and it's becoming very popular that's why so companies already talked about this company is using javascript we know this already so resources to learn well there's a lot of research you can learn well there's a lot of web fundamentals by building projects resources uh there's also for example free code camp there's front and mentor okay and by the way with this one when you get on the graduation call and if you actually wanna have this like learn what developed by building projects just mention this to the person that you have the graduation call with and then we'll be able to give you it's like a small little course that we have for our students sometimes who want to build some cool projects so just note it down for yourself if you want to actually want this course once again a call with the person for the graduation call ask them for that and they'll give it to you okay free code cam from the mentor youtube of course uh if you go to us on youtube there's some great resources to learn to learn there we have a fullon html course on our course literally guys if you take this and you take this you know css done so here's what i commend to you every single person okay can i can i can i give you guys a recommendation to everybody this will be really helpful to you can i tell you guys this one i want all of you right now really easy i want you to go through this course and through this course before tomorrow oh yeah like type in clever programmer html type it into search box or go to cleverprogrammer and then search up html crash course or css crash course and i want you to learn it by tomorrow every single person here right now every single person this is your goal for tomorrow literally not even kidding you this is going to mean they're like homework what the yeah yeah this is going to make your life so much easier and it's going to teach you so much it's only four hours guys it's not that bad you sit down for one hour you crank this out you sit down for another hour you crank this out and then maybe you do another hour so you got time okay tomorrow morning to the evening you got time can you promise me that who can promise me i'm actually curious who is so who is very dedicated who can promise i see you marian i see you i see you i see you who could promise when you can do this yes topher can promise me promise promise yes kevin can promise me who else nobody else can promise me nobody else put in the chat nice tamiz i see you nice nice nice i'm putting the chat nice oh wow okay and i'm look i'm looking to chat now brian landouk luffy beautiful i'll do it kidian yes bobby julian thori yes i promise yeah that's beautiful and of course we have an eighthour javascript crash course too you don't have to do this one for by tomorrow because of course there's a lot i recommend you guys go through this one and through this one and the javascript you guys will learn throughout so but i want you guys to go through these one these are going to be really powerful for you okay so these ones right that's it so here are some resources as well to use uh of course we got this score we got slide there's facebook linkedin instagram there's a lot of places you can use also for learning we also have a community do we have a community uh is amaz by the way as a mother here by any chance jesse um no he's not does he have the link to the community or no um no he wanted to share that another day okay so we have an actual community so we are actually building an amazing community on discord of just clever programmers it's a community and we want to build out to have a hundred thousand people 200 000 people literally you want to build this to become the biggest development community in the world and uh we're going to do this i'm not kidding you this is going to happen we will have a discord channel we have a discord channel by now it's currently closed it's private right now but if you want to be part of an amazing community but there will be thousands of people let me know in the chat let me know in the chat right now if you're on youtube let me know on youtube if you're on zoom let me know when you zoom literally there'll be thousands of people on there that's our goal is to make this community big and humongous and there we go that beautiful beautiful beautiful yes yes yes yes yes all right and of course we got the javascript tour that's happened 2021 um by the way just really curious as did anybody here buy tickets for the javascript tour just on this session anybody here or you guys still thinking about it anybody here buy javascript tickets for the session oh you did fernando you did not they did nice lamont did yeah okay cool cool cool cool cool so a few people did awesome sweet if i see in the chat i'm really curious because if you did i'll actually i want to go ahead i bought a few weeks ago somebody said a buy one on the early bird nice nice i did nina did oh nice nina beautiful frank did fernando did nice sweet

questions frank kevin did you have a question or no by the way you also must have your uh zoom call zoom video on we'll take any questions whatsoever it doesn't matter if it's about coding if it's samir samir i see you my friend okay let's add you some here hold on let me find you some here it's just getting harder now okay and i'm gonna put all you guys on uh youtube as well so we can all see it right there okay bye adrian okay good good good so if you have questions let me see deborah you had a question oh no where was samir samara you were first i'm trying to find you hold on oh there's two of you hold on which one do i pick okay this one um let me see where are you samir talk i think you're me asked you i'm here go ahead samir hello hey how's it going my friend hey how are you guys doing good doing good time thank yeah um first of all thanks a lot for this amazing content you guys are putting out out there um i myself have been uh you know learning a lot from you guys um by the way guys if you don't know nas is my python developer as well so yeah nice he's been a great support to me and and i'm pretty much um uh thankful that i came across cp the whole cbd yeah so thank you thank you you got it thank you thank you appreciate me anna and you know i love having uses too oh there we go i see now hold on can i follow you oh i can't there we go ah beautiful i like a spot on myself and i guess jesse nice yes yes yes so oh no why not you muted yourself let me admit it yourself samir i'll move yourself wait wait here here i got you here go on your phone on your phone on your phone there we go no do it again do it again one more time i'm yourself there you go can you hear me now yeah beautiful perfect perfect so my question is that um okay you said that certifications are not important like what certificates are not important like what like during the interview when you go for a job right so so during the interview if the interviewer is asking okay if you have some certification house then show me or you know show me your certification your course your degree or something and if you don't have that how can we tackle those same kind of situation during an interview yeah so yeah so you see you say that kind of like this okay if you don't have certification you say hey i don't have certifications but i went to these places and instead of certifications i actually have projects to approve on what i did that's it okay like for example if you don't have if you don't get a certification from for example from us right let's just say you are in this challenge and there's no certification that you will be given to you you say okay well don't have certifications but here's the projects that we did that i learned and then hear the technologies that i learned there right and then you actually talk about what did you learn that's it so you talk about hey you know what i learned this i learned that i learned maybe how to create an api i learned how to create you know api routes that i created in front of a technolon application that will actually use the api routes you know and work together to create a whole web application system that's it okay so so because because uh i have seen uh when i have seen the job interview a job description they have like some of the companies have over here have like certifications a month or a degree is a must you know let's still apply still apply a lot of those descriptions on um in terms of uh given about developers or descriptions on job postings are a bunch of [ __ ] okay because and it's not their fault and it's not their fault because sometimes for example you know um a lot a lot of times big companies uh they will have for example uh it's right it's hr so hr will actually have uh they're given all these little things that they you know oh this guy needs to have this and this like there's there's job postings where it says like 10 years of experience you know 10 years of coding something really that doesn't [ __ ] matter you know like it doesn't matter as long as the team likes you and as long as you pass the interview and you know what you're talking about the team will overlook everything else that you have by the way guys i've never even applied for a job like a position that was available i just looked for companies that i liked and even though they didn't have a junior position at the time or an internship i would still send them an email send them an email letter that's right real that's it that's it so it's so it's more it's more of a connection what you make and the presentation what you give in during an interview that's right that's much about right that's right it's right it's more so how you showcase yourself and how you make the other person feel about you okay okay so don't ever when they talk with certifications don't ever let them bog you down because don't ever let them think that oh you know because i don't have certification i'm not good enough or or you know that it's a must no be confident with it yeah you know what no i don't did not get a certification because i think it's unnecessary or i think it's not needed for me what most i got from it is knowledge and i built these amazing projects with what i learned that's it depends makes sense thank you thank you so much and you say you say it proudly so samir actually say with me right now so if i was an interviewer and i interviewed right now i say hey samir you know but what kind of certifications have you had like i feel like certifications are really important some of your what will be your response uh i would say that uh i don't have a certification but what i have is the projects which i have worked on myself and i've been building with my own with using my own knowledge and and um the skills i know about the language i can show you the how does it work and the main the whole project by itself so okay all right beautiful i think you could put even more confidence into that to speak very clearly so i think let's try one more time okay i want you to speak a little bit more about okay what did you learn so i want you to actually go deeper into what you actually learned okay so i don't have a certificate with me but rather i have projects which have built just using html css and javascript okay and in those i have in in in terms of html it's just basic html but when it comes to css i've used uh flexbox i have used great for for positioning of the of the of the content in my website and and and when it comes to javascript i've used uh i've used a uh apis to which which which interacts the backend on the front end of the website so yeah that's good that's good really good stuff that's good the only thing i would say for you to work on is maybe say it maybe more louder and maybe say with the without more of like a hunch you know making sure that that you're more of a you know you've got more of a stance on it right so as long as you're like not breaking your voice because that says a lot as well so they're an interview they're reading you a lot in an interview they're going to read you a lot so for example for those of you guys who signed up for hacker noon you know um hacking we actually did a interview with hacker and we talked about how does he hire he hires a lot based on just how you speak and how you talk like how you're compassionate that's right like they hire a lot about you know are you truthful right if you're simply just truthful if you're not making a [ __ ] if you're a truthful person that's this person they want to hire they hire a lot more on soft skills right now he said it himself go watch the video guys it's on a youtube channel it's with the hacker and ceo go watch it you'll see it it's there and so that's why i say soft skills are so important in this industry okay so you're doing you're doing good just be more confident stay present and that's it i'm here okay thank you thank you so much uh announced once again you got it my friend you got it okay perfect all right next one what's up and if you guys have any questions let me go ahead i'm with you from spotlight all right any other questions here let me see if i have anyone else uh tamiz go ahead okay um yeah i want to say hi dummies hello can you hear me yeah we can hear you go ahead you speak up a little bit more i think oh okay is that better yeah yes okay um i wanted to take the freelance route okay but i'm still like learning the foundations um i do have a decent grasp on some things what exactly would i need before i put myself out there because i don't want to start putting myself out there and then i'm not able to do what's required and then next thing you know i develop a bad reputation right yeah so good question good question i think maybe just you want to take over for that so um first of all a freelancer um like i talked about before it's not only having technical skills okay because you also need to get clients get paid so you gotta do acquisition um you gotta do the contracts you gotta do the invoicing so there's a whole you gotta learn how to run a business next to doing technical skills when you become a freelancer okay so that's something you have to be aware of when starting out as a freelancer first of all second is um you're saying you don't want to get the bad repetition the thing is though we can't really control the future in the sense of you know sometimes you just gotta try it out and do your utter best right and then hope you'll just work hard enough on it and make it succeed make it work okay so there's no such thing as a bad repetition if you just keep in contact with your client and keep communicating and also what's very important um a very good freelancer or a very good developer is somebody who communicates very well so that means meeting your clients expectations at all times so if you feel like you can finish this project within the next two months great don't tell the client that tell the client they're getting the project in three months then maybe ask for support next to it so you can also make it within that those three months and you're delivering it then you know maybe you're becoming so good you're able to deliver it in two and a half months guess what you're over delivering and your client is happy but you didn't um how to say you didn't cut yourself short because you were honest to yourself and you are meeting the expectations of the client so there's no way that a bad reputation can come from that as long as you're loyal integer and are committed okay first of all that second of all i would um as a freelancer you do need the technical skills now as a freelancer you can either work solo or you can start creating your own team the thing is though if you start freelancing but this is just my personal opinion if you start freelancing but you've never worked in a professional environment as a software developer it's going to be really hard because you don't know really how a software developer team works at that moment you don't know the process you don't have the process just yet right yeah your internet is breaking up naz oh really oh i think i'm good um so i would say before going into freelancing you should start for one year have a job as a software developer just to get the experience just to know how it is to work in a software development environment in a corporate environment how they work with github how they plan their projects how much time it takes to finish a project what they do with testing because that way um you learn all of that without having to risk it all for yourself which you do as a freelancer you bury the you carry the risk when you're a freelancer that's right okay so that that would be my advice um that freelancing just started straight off the bat it's not easy i wouldn't also not recommend that because you don't want to be focused on running the business you want to be focused on learning the technical skills okay and if you become a software developer you work there for two years great you got experience on the technical level now you can see how they run their business and you can copy that if they're really a good startup or something you know and also build network because if you become a freelancer now off the bat it's going to be hard for you to also put time in to networking that's right as you know you come to our community and all that of course there are things like that but you have to invest time in that next to that okay does it answer your question yes it does but uh from your answer it brings me to another question um what you said about starting out with um a company for about a year so okay what is the skill should i expect to have like that i need to go in there just beginning like do i need to have all the data structures and apis and all like that and just have all this knowledge or like what what do i uh actually need to before i start you know applying so good good yeah good point excellent question nice so for this one is nothing crazy learn javascript on html or css the way you learn those is you build more projects you know and you keep doing things on your own so for example maybe you built a few projects through youtube now maybe you build a few projects of yourself that you want to do okay so you do that besides that the one hunkered out because once you build projects okay great you i've built some projects i know javascript i know html and no css okay great i know that once you've learned that maybe now you go a step forward and then you learn a little bit of reactions so just you know a simple framework that you can bring to attend attention when you go into an interview that makes you a much better a suitable for a job okay if you know a framework like react.js or vue.js or angular and so i always recommend you know react.js just as a starter but you can pick anyone as you're doing that the one thing you're going to see yourself stuck with is actually the interview process the interview is not going to be as hard as actually passing the interview okay once you've got a good portfolio you have some good knowledge around javascript html css react.js uh you know maybe node.js you've got some good knowledge around that and you maybe you went and you went to the interview the hard thing is now passing the interview but the thing is when you pass the interview you it's you you will need to learn those foundations and the foundations are the following it is the algorithms it is a data structures it's all of those so right now what i want you to focus on is focus on learn this fundamentals so like free code camp maybe you know um maybe udacity maybe uh you go to code academy you learn those fundamentals of javascript html css and then maybe you start building projects but you build one or two projects from tutorials and that's okay but then you have to do things by yourself so i recommend for people to do the following build a project from a tutorial and then add your own something to it okay that will actually teach you how to do it okay because without that all you're doing just copying and you're watching somebody else do it and that's not necessary that's not useful at all what is useful however is when you're using your brain right and the ideas are coming from you and the problemsolving is coming from you that is what's useful so right now i just want you to focus on the knowledge and building up the portfolio that's all it thanks a lot to answer your question yes it did awesome thank you very much thomas i hope you have a great did you schedule your graduation call by the way uh yes i did okay on the second at nine with uh jesse nice all right yay all right okay thank you very much in that case have yourself a good day who's next anybody else oh jeffy i remember you jeffrey jeffrey franklin i remember you from the last one too okay who else had a question let me see remove spotlight here let me see please raise your hand so i can see you or just say me in the chat so i can see otherwise it's really hard for me to actually see you guys okay if we don't need questions we're gonna stop here in a second let me see here me daniel daniel amiya let me see if i can see you here i'm mion okay hey daniel hey what's going on guys how are you my friend what's up danielle so um for somebody that's a full stack engineer just coming out of uh a boot camp oh dang okay what boot camp where'd you go kenzie academy oh how have a few people who went there okay yeah um my question is for someone that's coming out of boot camp and someone that's you know as we know boot camps they cram everything in at a certain amount of time that's right and it's it's hard for some people to really grasp the knowledge that's being given to them so for me i what what my question is is is anyone here at clever programmer able to be a mentor to someone like me coming out of a boot camp so i guess my question is anyone of you two able to be a mentor for someone like me so we don't have a mentorship program per se right but we do have a mentorship through other ways so let me ask you that okay why are you looking for a mentor right now why aren't you why aren't you ready to apply for jobs right now you just came from booth camp how many months did you do it uh one full year one full year okay all right why do you feel like at this point you don't need a mentor i i think i just i mean i honestly feel that i need a little more help to keep myself uh focus on i think more i'm looking more focused on the front end okay so okay great so i'm trying to understand why so tell me why in that case what what are some things that you feel like you're not comfortable with i think more i'm more uncomfortable with the first half of the boot camp was front end and then the second half was all back in like python django and you know rest framework and so front end which used what technologies tell me html css react express node.js mongodb okay so what do you not know about react.js that's hard for you to understand give them something not what i don't know i think it's just more that i would have to focus more on um i mean i have i have the i have the projects and everything like that i think i just need to focus more on the skills that i've learned and actually apply them myself and you know be able to um you know the way i i learned is if you don't use it you lose it that's true 100 yeah so let me ask you this okay okay do you know any algorithms data structures do you know for example stacks queues you know how did you get the chance to learn those at your kenzie academy yes okay so if i ask you a question very simple right now i asked you hey daniel uh create for me a function that will merge to a race together can you do it for me on the spot right now no no it's been that long like no because the the way the schooling had worked they focused us as soon as you move away they didn't give us enough time to allow i i well i didn't i wasn't able to go back and just continue to work on it on my own because i was just more focused on what was right there in front of me gotcha so then in that case did you actually learn those data structures yes well right but you can't answer that question right not without going back and have to think about it i couldn't answer that right right see but what i asked you is a very simple interview question right right so i'm just i'm asking these questions i'm trying to understand where the root is right to understand what the root problem is and i still think the real problem is add those funded foundations and fundamentals and i do think that it's about also using the knowledge that you've learned which is react gs and actually applying more of that towards the real world right but it's not just that it's also about learn those foundational fundamental skills because you've got the portfolio okay you went for one year right you know towards the kenzie academy or whatever it's called and you've got the portfolio it's it's there i'm guessing you built projects there correct correct yes you just start applying for jobs the best way to use what you learned is to just apply for jobs okay but the issue becomes here is not applying for jobs it's actually getting the job to get to get the job right because once you're in it and they see your portfolio and you've known some stuff okay great then you actually start to use what you've learned and that's how you get to learn even more you see what i mean so the most important thing is not just about using more of what you know it's actually more about using what you currently know using that to apply to a position and then you just see yourself growing from there right but the issue is getting that job so what you need to now learn is is actually you need to start applying for jobs like literally right now i i've been applying for jobs you know okay i've been applying uh mainly frontend jobs okay and have you gotten any interviews no no interviews yet no interviews why is that what do you why do you think that's the case um maybe i need to work on a resume okay that's part one work on uh bettering my resume maybe you know but i am also working with uh i guess kenzie academy has a career team that helps you with building up the right resumes and uh getting a portfolio together but i've learned my portfolio through you guys i didn't use you know what what kenzie academy wanted me as a portfolio so really yeah i it look it just clever programmer uh portfolio it just looks better okay officially visually and functionally it looks better okay great that's awesome that's awesome i'm happy to happy to hear that that you you actually use that um but right well now what i see is okay now you when you're applying for jobs what might be stopping you is part one is your resume and part two your portfolio and your linkedin so you need to work on those three things so you need to go back to kenzie and to talk them be like hey you know what i need to improve my linkedin your resume because like or not no matter what you know if your resume sucks and your like thing sucks it doesn't matter then that case whatever you know that does not matter at all right you see what i mean so yes what needs to happen here is you need to go back to them talk to them and say hey you know can somebody help me with my portfolio or my just simple resume because resume says a lot and is the reason why either you get submitted into the pile of yes interview them or no i do not want to interview them because that's the only way they know you they only know you their resume how else are they do they know you right they don't know you they can't see you they don't know who you are where you're from what you know hell no they only know you through your resume and if it's nicely built the way it's supposed to be then yes you have an opportunity there that's the first thing you need to fix okay okay second thing you need to fix is okay apply for more jobs so how many jobs have you applied to about 50 jobs so far i need to apply them more right so that's part of one is applying to more jobs there should be a minimum of 100 to 200 jobs applied in general okay right maybe even 300 jobs that's possible too right okay so that's another portion of it then when you're applying for jobs and this should literally be your job should be to apply for jobs right now that should literally just be your job and while you're doing that you need to be freshen up on your algorithms and data structures you need to go to youtube and you need to learn algorithms and data structures go to youtube type in algorithms data structures just type it in and learn those stacks cues you need to buy a book called cracking the coding interview okay okay it's called cracking the corgi write that down very important cracking the coding interview that's right you need to go to websites like lead code like hacker rank and you need to practice those algorithms and data structures because like it or not you will be asked those questions what i asked you i said i asked you a question daniel right i asked you can you emerge to a race for me together that is the simplest question that you will be asked another question for example i was asked this question create for me a function that will reverse and narrate can you do that can you reverse an array from me you have an array reverse it using a function can you do that not right now right so you need to learn those type of things i'm asking you because i i want to get to the root again i'm just getting the right thing right this is really important it's a really important conversation we're having yes right so get to the root so you need to learn those algorithms to data structures and that is actually how you will become a better developer and how not only will you become a better developer you will become more confident and that is what will train you for the actual interview is what i mean yes so keep using that keep interview or keep applying for jobs fix your before you apply to more jobs make sure you you run your resume and your linkedin by someone because for example for us when we run our own bootcamp we have a booth team called full stack mastery bootcamp when we do it we have a specific theory two three week process where we fix your resume and we fix your linkedin because it's so important okay so make sure you go back to kenzie and actually fix it with them that's part one and then of course and then just you know focus on the algorithms and data structures so that you're prepared for the interview when that does come around got it okay and if you do want more mentorship then did you schedule your graduation call by any chance i scheduled it when i first signed up for the course oh that's an onboarding call that's an onboarding call well i'm talking about the graduation call did you schedule that i actually wanted to do a call with you okay well

a moment of measurement for you it's just a realization of hey i'm not yet where i want to be right that's all it is there's nothing wrong with it there's nothing you know bad about it it's just the way it is right now so now you gotta look at the future and be like okay so what can i do right now in order to go to the next level okay that's all this cold this conversation for you should be about

realization i would say congratulations you know for making it this far come join the next few days come code with us have fun with it okay put your back into it make a revamp your portfolio put in

august 5th let's do this let's get to then daniel did you get did you gotta give me a thumbs up got it nice so go ahead guys there's you test oh dang there's a few times that's available there guys so there you go all right okay cool sweet uh any other questions any other questions you guys got for us it's almost uh 2 p.m nas that's right so we're going to be ending here in a little bit guys maybe one last question frank frank will to give you almost a question will you have about five minutes left guys uh let me see frank frank frank okay i see you my friend asked to unmute go ahead frank i can't get me hi frank hello hello hello so uh yeah i'm pursuing a cs master degree and i'm uh expected to do graduate this december so i'm just looking for a job but as i actually had the internship last year about kind of like a frontend but unfortunately i didn't learn too much from that because they just gave me some code you know like they use the angular and it's a little hard for me to get started because i learned to learn uh kind of wet web development during master you know uh graduate years i only learned learning undergraduate with php that part so yeah you know it's outdated right so yeah and actually the thing is after last internship i just don't know uh what you started and now a little hard for me to land a job or something so i just want to ask uh what what kind of thing to uh i can improve from the resume because some uh when i have the interview they just ask me uh is that uh does that the class project you did or do did you do something out outside the classroom but uh uh unfortunately i don't do too much on that yeah but you but you but you had an internship right uh last year but it's on campus year one yeah yeah but but it's still an internship that you did right and it still involved coding yeah that well can i say it again so so the internship that you did did that involve coding yeah yeah involve coding that's the front end uh yeah so but i just feel a little bad they just send me the code send me the api you know the swagger swagger the documentation but uh i just don't know what what to start and that's a little struggling i mean yeah no for sure for sure for sure i think um what country amber are you at usa yeah i mean los angeles now oh you're los angeles okay and i i plan to join the onsite boot camp on well we'll help you what we'll walk you through and how to improve that okay so that's part one all right that just gave me an idea let me write that down hold on um um let me see uh resume linkedin okay sorry just give me an idea that's why so i think for you uh if you feel like you're just not comfortable enough for example if they give you a project to do okay frank if they give you a project to do and you just simply don't know where to start let me ask you this where do you think you should start like what do you think you should start if they give you this build this api with swagger let's just talk about that where do you think you should start what i'm doing last year i'm what i'm doing try to uh mapping the code the part of code with uh the you know the part on the windows you know on the window on the scope for example the which table uh does this code do or what we were kind of like uh word part words uh what parts that this code uh try to do so i just try to make this mapping thing so right yeah and try to learn the documentation but actually i don't really know how to use postman like you know that so that's another thing because i didn't learn it before so that's but can you learn it can you still learn though can you still learn um can you still learn that communication or no okay like do you think that you if you were given that task to to learn how to use swagger can you do you think you can learn it actually no that's why i don't know how to start what i yeah i mean just so many things i don't know at that time angularjs the swagger how does this frontend background work works because usually i just build my personal project you know that's kind of thing i know everything back and forth but in that part i i can't get access to the background code or yeah it's a little hard it's a big project so i can only do this part so just a little little bit uh uncomfortable so look i i think i think i think for you what might be the best to start out with is you need to look at this this big problem and divide into small problems so let's say for example you have to create an api with swagger right you know and so forth right you think about okay well one how do i create an api that's part of one okay so maybe you do research on how to create an api this is this is all about problem solving guys it's just all about problem solving right there were everybody were at a point where they did not know how to do something and then they learned it right so you're the point where you remember you don't know those technologies you don't know where to start but where to start is okay looking at the big picture here okay what are some small problems that i see well what the problems i see i see okay i see an api okay how can i solve this remember it's where were those two philosophies how can i solve it and then the fact that i can't solve it your question should be how can i solve it so api section how do i solve the api section how do i create an api maybe that's what you focus on okay next one swagger okay how do i use swagger how do i understand swagger you go to youtube you figure out okay how do i understand swagger to actually use it because swagger role is documentation for your api correct yeah that's right right so you look at that and you figure that portion out once you forget that portion okay okay i kind of understand what it's asking me to do let's now take it step by step so you think about okay i'm going to give myself one day to create my first api endpoint maybe at first i will create my node.js server api or whatever that might be so i look up okay let's figure out how to create how do you create an api you go to youtube you figure out how do you create an api and you do that and maybe it has nothing to do with swagger or with the project that you're doing but you were but you put yourself in that situation to actually learn it small steps so you did that small step what's next after you've done that what's next then tell me uh i guess try to use the api documentation we have to test my code or test the just the code we we already have i mean that's right that's right you test the code that's right you test the code and you see you know if it works or not you started to test the api so these little things that you have to try and do that get you to the actual the actual uh you know fullon process for me for example when i had my first internship frank okay i'll give an example i had my first internship and before i had it the way i got it was really interesting i was a creative computing club okay and i saw this one guy who was building a project called trandala right and they will build this application that's really cool and there was a web application i was like oh my god can i build this can i work with you guys can i help you guys out like yeah sure so to actually get into the internship they gave me a task they said hey nas create for us a web scraper that will scrape data from this website using python so what did i do i went home and the first question i typed into google was what is python not kidding yeah i had the same what is my name that's right like literally i had no idea how to use what is python how to use it so i'll look at what is python and i kind of learn some things about python then i ask myself question okay how do i scrape data from a database so i said how to build a scraper in python and i saw a bunch of tutorials on medium on youtube and how they built scrapers on python so i watched them and i saw what they did and i actually built projects with them once i learned that those little two pieces i'm like okay so time to build my own scraper i realized that i can use beautiful soup and then i can use a link and then i can simply just get the html and then i use the specific a html html attributes to actually get certain aspects of the actual data that's it and i built this scraper now i want you to ask me how much do you think how long do you think that took me two weeks two days two days what's very visible here nas is that you ask the right questions and when you ask the right questions guys you get the right answers simple as that so frank it's just a matter of asking the right questions like when i say that before you know like it's not about why can't i solve it it's about how can i solve this what is the next step what should i be looking at where can i get clarity on what's my plan you know that sort of stuff wow can i break this bra problem into small pieces what is one small piece and what would be the next small piece i have to solve you know that sort of things does that answer your question yeah this is my first question and uh after that what i said is uh landing for the next job next internship maybe like in the fourth semester or something but uh i just want to know how i can do on my resume of some projects which they just don't think that it's just a class project you you did every student do that so just do more projects that's it what do you think is the answer that if they if they're saying it's not enough product then what is the answer what is the answer that you know what the answer is huh i mean tell them what what i learned from it but they just think if it's a class project they feel like frank is so frank then what is the answer to that what is the answer that they're saying that they don't want class projects or it's not enough for them yeah yeah right so what is the resolution what is the solution it was a build by our by myself outside the classroom right though yeah yeah that's the thing that's it there's no other solution so what are you gonna do now doing my own project so that's why i just want to join this bootcamp and try to maybe think about what i will do so no don't think don't think do okay got it okay all right keep thinking about it and of course and when you come to the fiveday bootcamp the fiveday uh the threeday uh august 6th or august 8th the javascript tour oh i will talk to you in person and we'll definitely chat about how you can improve and there'll be so much that you will learn just there in the javascript tour okay oh poor cool thank you awesome thank you so much awesome looking forward to see you on site yes let's go i'm excited too all right we'll see you there frank okay yeah see you yeah thank you all right guys that is it my
