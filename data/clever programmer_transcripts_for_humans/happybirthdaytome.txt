00:03 - hey guys how's it going this is Kazi
00:06 - from clever programmer comm we're going
00:10 - live today so it's my birthday today and
00:15 - I thought hey what more exciting way to
00:18 - celebrate it and to start off my day
00:21 - then spend some time with you guys and
00:24 - also do something that I love a lot
00:25 - which is play chess so today is gonna be
00:29 - not so serious day and check it out I'm
00:31 - wearing the all right this way
00:34 - clever programmer shirt but yeah so
00:38 - today it's not gonna be such a serious
00:39 - day we're just gonna be having fun so
00:41 - before this video even starts if you're
00:43 - here for programming there's not gonna
00:44 - be too much programming I'm just gonna
00:46 - be hanging out and also I'll answer some
00:50 - questions for fun so you know any any
00:53 - question you want to ask me could be
00:55 - anything
00:56 - or if you want to keep you know ask me
00:58 - some technical program in question I'll
01:00 - answer that as well
01:01 - but other than that I'll play some chess
01:05 - and teach you some chests and you can
01:07 - just watch it over my shoulder and see
01:09 - my crazy reactions as I'm playing and my
01:11 - thought process and maybe pick up secret
01:14 - or two that you can use as well yep so
01:19 - we'll see how it goes okay let's see if
01:22 - there are people here so far hi oh nice
01:27 - there are other people whose birthday
01:29 - happy birthday George thank you guys
01:35 - thank you I appreciate it
01:38 - thank you thank you thank you doctor
01:41 - says it was his birthday yesterday happy
01:44 - birthday doc you guys are way too nice
01:48 - way too nice
01:52 - alright so I'm gonna start playing and
01:59 - just watch along and let me know how you
02:00 - guys like it okay cool so let's see
02:03 - hopefully I have my stuff set up right
02:10 - um you do this I think that should be
02:16 - good
02:17 - we'll double-check in a little bit but
02:20 - um I'm gonna play like a three minute
02:22 - game and I'll try to talk my way through
02:24 - it hopefully and we'll see how I do I'm
02:27 - probably gonna lose cuz it takes a lot
02:28 - of attention to play a quick game but
02:31 - let's see so my rating is almost 2000
02:35 - which puts me around the top 1% in chess
02:40 - but when you play online they put you
02:43 - against people of your own ratings and
02:44 - chests the goal is to get this guy the
02:46 - king if you guys don't know so that's
02:49 - really what I'm gonna be focusing on and
02:52 - I have a little bit of experience
02:55 - playing chess okay so I want to put my
02:59 - rook here so I can attack his King and
03:02 - he blocks it which is a good move and
03:06 - I'll move back cuz he was gonna take my
03:07 - bishop okay
03:09 - I will do this so now I'm gonna take his
03:13 - knight if he doesn't do anything so he
03:15 - does do something let's see why can't I
03:18 - just win a pawn here so I'm thinking I
03:22 - can take the knight he takes back with
03:23 - the rook I take what the rook he takes
03:25 - with the Queen and then I take here
03:29 - because now the Queen isn't guarding the
03:31 - pawn anymore
03:32 - so I'm oh wait maybe I can just take
03:36 - here right now takes Bishop to Bishop
03:40 - tags I'm actually let's do it this way
03:45 - okay so now I have an extra pawn he's
03:50 - probably gonna play here and I have to
03:53 - see what I can do you know with that
03:55 - pawn and try to win off of that pawn
03:58 - he's playing a little bit aggressively
04:00 - but I'm gonna like strike back I don't
04:03 - want him to put the pond in front of my
04:07 - face okay let's see okay I'm gonna go
04:15 - here open that up a little bit and then
04:18 - play here so now I'm attacking that pawn
04:21 - and also I can put my bishop or I'm an
04:25 - attack his rook and now what about
04:31 - Knight g5 doesn't that yeah that move is
04:35 - really annoying cuz I'm attacking this
04:37 - guy there's no good way for him to
04:38 - defend it except move his rook here to
04:40 - protect that pawn because I have one two
04:42 - attackers on this guy and he has one two
04:45 - defenders but he doesn't want to give up
04:47 - his queen to defend I'm also preparing
04:53 - for a tournament that's coming up this
04:54 - weekend
04:55 - it's gonna be a pretty tough tournament
04:57 - it's called Chicago class so I'm gonna
04:59 - be playing there Knight takes rook takes
05:02 - Queen a4 no I don't like that actually I
05:08 - just feel like I have a lot of pressure
05:11 - on his position here and now oh did I
05:15 - just drop this pawn oh I'm an idiot oh
05:17 - oh wait is there a knight takes f7 no
05:20 - ship takes rook yeah I kind of messed
05:28 - this one up guys okay well it is what it
05:34 - is dropped a pawn here Oh what if I take
05:42 - his Bishop and then play rook here oh he
05:48 - attacks my knight and then I move here
05:52 - keeping threat on his rope night and
05:55 - then bishop and also fork yeah so it
06:00 - looks like I should be okay here with
06:02 - after Knight here
06:04 - yeah I think so well he has rook here
06:07 - dang this lucky guy huh it's very close
06:13 - oh I have Knight here there's crazy
06:16 - stuff going on all over the place okay
06:20 - so now he wants to play a rook here to
06:22 - attack my knight and then if I move my
06:25 - knight he wants to play rook here
06:27 - I even tried to checkmate me but that's
06:29 - not gonna be happening
06:30 - right now because I have a lot of
06:32 - pressure on this pawn and he can't move
06:35 - this pawn this bishop is attacking it
06:37 - rook and Knight I have 37 seconds he has
06:42 - one minute 28 seconds he can win on time
06:44 - so if I go 2-0 minutes 0 seconds he wins
06:48 - and after this round is over I'll take a
06:50 - break and then I'll come back and I'll
06:52 - answer some of your guys's burning
06:54 - questions why did he do that
06:56 - I just went his bishop okay
06:59 - so now it's yeah he resigned here
07:03 - because I have so Bishop is worth three
07:08 - points rook is five points and pawns are
07:11 - one point so basically if you add all of
07:14 - this up I'm ahead by a eight points and
07:19 - you know I'm gonna basically take his
07:22 - pawns then move this pawn up and get a
07:24 - queen and then I would use this this
07:27 - piece and my new queen to then checkmate
07:29 - the King he doesn't want to play that
07:31 - and he resigned okay so I'm gonna switch
07:35 - over and try to answer some of your
07:37 - guys's
07:38 - questions now hopefully you guys saw
07:43 - that fine ooh lots of happy birthday's
07:48 - coming through nice thank you guys thank
07:52 - you thank you thank you yeah Katie you
07:57 - you should come here you guys are
07:59 - welcome to come here and celebrate my
08:01 - birthday with me if you guys are in
08:03 - United States I would love to catch up
08:06 - with you guys and just hang out yeah I
08:15 - should really be coding today but I
08:17 - decided to take a day off from coding
08:20 - I'm trying I'm playing some chess
08:22 - recently so you know kind of felt like
08:25 - doing that for a little bit but okay
08:28 - guys go ahead if you guys have questions
08:29 - I'll ask them now before I start my next
08:32 - chess game and then
08:38 - I won't be able to answer them and I'm
08:41 - playing the game because I can't see
08:42 - your questions alright let's see okay
08:53 - good
08:53 - oh we have lots of people live that's
08:55 - actually really cool we got a bunch of
08:57 - you guys online ask me your questions
09:00 - ask me your questions I'll answer them
09:06 - you guys are way too nice yeah well okay
09:12 - so subscribers are going up which is
09:16 - great the channel really was add you
09:20 - know zero subscribers and are very few
09:22 - subscribers until September last year
09:24 - and one of my goals by December was to
09:28 - get 100 subscribers but instead of
09:31 - getting 100 subscribers by December I
09:34 - ended up getting 5,000 subscribers by
09:37 - December which was phenomenal and yeah
09:42 - according to my calculations back in the
09:44 - day 60,000 subscribers should have taken
09:47 - like three or four years but that ended
09:50 - up happening a lot quicker than that
09:51 - meaning it ended up happening in July
09:53 - which is again fantastic thank you guys
09:56 - so much for supporting the channel if
09:59 - you haven't subscribed please do
10:00 - subscribe but I have a feeling that you
10:02 - must have subscribed because you got the
10:05 - notification for the livestream and I'm
10:10 - from like right now did you just get a
10:12 - notification from YouTube or did you get
10:16 - an email from me and that's what brought
10:18 - you here oh wow
10:20 - Katie knows chess openings nice well
10:22 - let's see okay so mukha says feed
10:25 - aerating my feed eeeh trading is
10:27 - probably around 1900 1800 my USCF rating
10:30 - is about 2002 it was 2000 66 in peak
10:33 - time but then I stopped playing chess I
10:36 - focused more in software development I
10:37 - focused more on making pointing getting
10:39 - clients and my chess rating dropped and
10:43 - so now that I have more time I mean I'm
10:46 - trying to play chess again because I
10:48 - just loved it
10:50 - um yeah my favorite chess opening is
10:55 - Joko piano I love it I understand it
10:58 - really well
10:59 - it's spelled really weirdly and most of
11:02 - you guys won't know what the heck I'm
11:03 - talking about but it's probably one of
11:05 - the most basic openings you ever learn
11:07 - in chess and I love it and I play it to
11:11 - this day and I can maybe maybe show it
11:14 - to you really quickly so here's how Joko
11:19 - piano looks I want to close the chess
11:29 - engine so basically I bring my night out
11:32 - so one of the things that you guys
11:33 - should know if you're playing chess so
11:35 - these are some top secrets is that don't
11:38 - move your pawns a lot and every move you
11:40 - make should control one of these four
11:42 - squares just this secret alone will help
11:46 - you beat almost like anybody that you
11:49 - play against I don't mean competitive
11:51 - players but like if you're playing as
11:52 - your dad your brother your friend you
11:55 - know your cousin and you've been getting
11:57 - beat by them all the time just a secret
12:00 - alone will help you a lot so in the
12:02 - opening only make moves that control the
12:04 - center so okay here's a opening move I
12:06 - bring my knight out and it controls two
12:09 - Center squares because Knight can attack
12:11 - like this and this and then black brings
12:14 - his Knight out and then I play Bishop c4
12:16 - which again you know controlling these
12:18 - four squares and oh yeah this is joke Oh
12:22 - piano you know I don't want to go any
12:24 - deeper than this because they're like 10
12:26 - more moves down the line and all kinds
12:28 - of different variations and stuff but to
12:31 - keep it very simple this is what it
12:32 - looks like you know and these are moves
12:35 - that when you start out in chess these
12:37 - are some of the moves that you know get
12:39 - taught by your coach or really anybody
12:41 - who knows how to play chess a little bit
12:43 - they can show you but basically you know
12:47 - whites controlling the center really
12:48 - well blacks controlling the center
12:50 - really well and then you play on from
12:51 - here so I really love this opening and
12:54 - then I also like the Grand Prix against
12:56 - the Sicilian but you know I don't want
12:58 - to step into the esoteric category too
13:00 - much and I still want to keep you guys
13:02 - with me so
13:04 - let me switch again all right here we go
13:08 - so hopefully I kind of answered that
13:11 - question if SIL says hey Kazi your
13:23 - videos are awesome
13:24 - I need career advice regarding software
13:26 - web development such as technologies to
13:29 - go for and then what is the industry
13:33 - standard again you know it's not about
13:41 - how many technologies it's about really
13:44 - picking one and getting good at it and
13:46 - getting people results with it so you
13:50 - don't have to worry about too many
13:51 - different technology but you know focus
13:54 - on becoming good at one technology or
13:57 - language so for example I always talk
13:59 - about programming and let's say you're
14:00 - good at Java focus on becoming better at
14:03 - Java and then you'll be able to you know
14:06 - like get your foot in the door so you
14:11 - can start working with the company maybe
14:12 - as a junior developer or maybe as an
14:14 - intern and then you can all still teach
14:16 - you some other stacks meaning for
14:19 - example if they need you to do some web
14:21 - development they'll teach you sequel or
14:23 - they'll teach you
14:24 - I don't know HTML or CSS you know things
14:29 - like that and then you'll end up picking
14:30 - it up so get good at one thing and then
14:35 - you can add more things on top of that
14:37 - and you know another simple stack is
14:39 - Python Python HTML CSS may be a little
14:43 - bit of JavaScript but once you get good
14:46 - at one thing it's easy to pick up these
14:48 - other languages all right let's see
15:00 - okay ah let's see what are the questions
15:06 - I'm trying to yeah let's see
15:20 - Zara's says happy birthday thank you
15:23 - Sara
15:23 - and she says enjoy your date how do you
15:26 - stay active and physically fit while
15:28 - programming full time so if you just go
15:35 - with the natural momentum of things like
15:38 - just natural flow and go by how you feel
15:42 - like every day you will be in very bad
15:45 - shape which is where like most of the
15:47 - programmers get a bad rep and rightfully
15:50 - so most of them are like fat or don't
15:53 - take care of themselves or smell like
15:55 - crap and it's not it's kind of their
16:02 - fault but it's also not so much their
16:03 - fault because it's the field and the
16:05 - field itself it just kind of like you
16:08 - sit and you're creating awesome stuff
16:11 - but you're sitting most of the time you
16:12 - know and and you're not really moving
16:14 - around so you really have to make it a
16:17 - part of your day to go and put in some
16:21 - physical work and a lot of the times
16:24 - when you think of work you don't want to
16:26 - do it so how I like to make myself work
16:29 - is I like soccer
16:31 - so I'll join an intraoral intramural
16:34 - soccer team which is it's not
16:36 - competitive but it's a soccer team and
16:38 - so by playing a soccer game and being
16:40 - there for my team it's fun there's a lot
16:42 - of fun and it pretty much forces me to
16:46 - keep myself physically fit or I'll play
16:48 - tennis with my friends Reese you know I
16:51 - also lift but you know if lifting is
16:54 - difficult for you try one of these other
16:55 - strategies because you want it to be fun
16:59 - too to work out and then it'll become a
17:05 - habit after that so if it's just work
17:08 - you're not gonna do it you're gonna do
17:09 - it for a week and then you're gonna quit
17:12 - and now I'm doing like martial arts I'm
17:15 - doing jujitsu I'm doing boxing and those
17:19 - things give more purpose to you know
17:21 - just me improving my strength because
17:23 - strength like sure I can you know pick
17:25 - up more groceries and and obviously feel
17:29 - really fit strength is my favorite thing
17:31 - because I don't have to run
17:33 - but you know then adding in some
17:36 - fighting or like mixed martial arts
17:38 - gives it more of a purpose so you know
17:44 - create systems that force you to be
17:47 - there and force you to work just like
17:50 - when I started the clever programmer
17:53 - channel I was working with lots of
17:57 - clients around that time and I was going
18:00 - to college I had like multiple different
18:02 - jobs so I was putting it I mean I was
18:05 - working like 16 hours a day working or
18:08 - studying and then what I did was I gave
18:11 - up all my clients and I cut all my
18:15 - sources of income and and then I also
18:20 - got this office and that was an
18:23 - additional overhead expense and what
18:25 - that forced me to do was like that was
18:27 - great that I had motivation to keep this
18:29 - channel going but I made it so I
18:34 - literally had to survive off of this
18:36 - channel and live off of this channel and
18:39 - really turn it into a business and that
18:43 - was the best decision I've ever made
18:45 - because motivation keeps you going but
18:48 - then it can run out you know it's like
18:49 - willpower it can run out but then if
18:52 - it's necessity that doesn't run out
18:54 - because otherwise you just can't live
18:55 - you know you can't keep up your standard
18:57 - of lifestyle and the pain there is too
19:00 - much so may I make these systems for
19:03 - myself and you can do the same thing
19:06 - hopefully that answers your questions
19:08 - our jimothy that's an interesting name
19:13 - I've never heard jimothy of her Timothy
19:16 - and Jimmy but not jimothy
19:18 - so now in my new programming videos
19:20 - maybe you'll be hearing a lot of jimothy
19:22 - because I'm sick of Bob and banana those
19:25 - are the only two thin damn things that
19:27 - come to my mind and you you probably see
19:29 - that in all my tutorials but yeah
19:32 - jimothy films it's a great epic name
19:34 - he asks can you do C++ series like you
19:38 - did the Python series
19:44 - not right now I'm pretty focused on
19:47 - Python and the stack that goes behind
19:49 - Python so I'm gonna be really doing that
19:51 - not not too much C++ or anything right
19:54 - now
19:58 - aha let's see
20:15 - what are those numbers 80 77 78 I have
20:19 - no idea what numbers use it yeah it's
20:24 - always tough because you know um I will
20:27 - yeah I can start a blog on web
20:30 - development and all of that but the one
20:33 - thing that's tough is a lot of you guys
20:35 - are just starting out so most of the
20:37 - things aren't gonna make too much sense
20:39 - and I don't want to do stuff that you
20:43 - know just like you know just you just go
20:45 - and figure it out I'll just post random
20:47 - stuff so I'm really trying to cater and
20:50 - make stuff that everybody can understand
20:53 - and follow along and then you know we
20:56 - move and then you know more I'll add in
20:58 - more advanced stuff but there's a lot of
21:00 - missing pieces right now that I think
21:02 - are vital and are just not taught by so
21:06 - many other channels and programs so I
21:09 - want to make sure that I fill in those
21:11 - gaps for you guys
21:20 - vivix vivix says hey Kazi happy birthday
21:24 - I want to learn to develop iOS apps I'm
21:27 - reading a book by Apple on iBooks is it
21:33 - good question mark what do you recommend
21:35 - and I want to implement AI for an app
21:37 - idea um a book by Apple I don't know
21:44 - that sounds like a really technical
21:46 - jargon eBook that doesn't really teach
21:48 - how to create stuff but just kind of
21:49 - shows you some tutorials or something I
21:51 - haven't seen that book but I would
21:54 - recommend like you know just go on
21:55 - Amazon and look up some iOS book I
21:58 - personally don't have too much
21:59 - experience developing in iOS but I am
22:03 - familiar with the language that you use
22:05 - it's called Swift and if you want to
22:09 - develop AI stuff one of the best
22:12 - channels to follow a Siraj Raval it's s
22:16 - ir aj space are IV al somebody write
22:22 - that in chat please so people can see
22:24 - what channel I'm talking about and it's
22:26 - a channel on YouTube and this guy
22:28 - is phenomenal and he goes over a lot of
22:31 - machine learning concepts though they
22:34 - are advanced and if you don't know
22:36 - programming it wouldn't really make that
22:41 - much sense like you'll just be copying
22:42 - and pasting stuff which if you're ok
22:44 - with it then go definitely try it out
22:46 - but you know I would say go check them
22:49 - out and you learn a lot of like he'll
22:52 - show you how you can create a game of
22:54 - ping pong where the computer beat you
22:57 - know learns by losing and then gets
22:59 - better and better and like basically
23:00 - teach it teaches itself so that's AI and
23:04 - you can then you know use your iOS book
23:07 - and then learn what you learn from Sir
23:09 - Roger of all even though he teaches in
23:11 - Python but language doesn't matter
23:14 - concepts do and you can take what you
23:16 - learn from Suraj traval and then apply
23:18 - it to your iOS app by learning those
23:21 - applying those same concepts and Swift
23:24 - okay so yeah hmm ah nice Bassam console
23:42 - dot write line happy birthday nice one I
23:44 - love it
23:54 - Josie jo jo's Oh Ramos I'm butchering
23:59 - your name I'm sorry it's Jo su e space
24:03 - Ramos I says happy birthday I want to
24:06 - learn programming but I type too slow
24:08 - due to only being able to use one hand
24:11 - do you think this could be an impediment
24:14 - to learn it's actually really funny you
24:19 - say that not the funny part the funny
24:23 - part is not that you have one hand but
24:24 - the funny part that you type to slope
24:26 - because I am making I made a video about
24:30 - typing and how that it can actually help
24:33 - you learn much faster and get better
24:35 - results and why it's so important that
24:38 - video is gonna come out probably in a
24:41 - week or two but here's what I will say I
24:45 - don't think it's an impediment to do
24:48 - coding that's one great thing about
24:49 - coding that even if you don't have an
24:54 - arm you could still be a fantastic coder
24:56 - and code well because it's really about
24:58 - thoughts there isn't much typing mmm
25:03 - it's not like writing you know like for
25:07 - example a good code or can write
25:10 - something in two lines which you know an
25:12 - amateur might write in 20 or 50 lines so
25:16 - that just goes to show there's a lot of
25:18 - thought process that takes place and
25:19 - creativity that takes place when I'm
25:22 - coding on a project or doing a problem
25:26 - 90% plus of my time is spent thinking
25:29 - so it's either I'm sitting here thinking
25:31 - like this or I'm going out for a walk
25:35 - and I just close my eyes and I'm
25:38 - thinking of possible solutions and you
25:41 - know different ideas that I could come
25:43 - up with and that I could implement so
25:49 - when I come to write the code after like
25:52 - two hours of thinking I might write
25:54 - three lines of code so you know there
25:56 - isn't a lot crazy amount of typing now
26:00 - of course it's going to be an impediment
26:01 - but I also watch this video that you
26:05 - should look at
26:06 - I forgot what it was called but
26:08 - basically this guy is writing code in
26:14 - Emacs which is a writing editor and he's
26:22 - writing it he's using dictation and this
26:25 - guy has developed some insane system to
26:28 - write code by just speaking and he he's
26:31 - paralyzed I don't even think and any of
26:34 - his hands work and he's literally just
26:36 - and he does alive on in a live event he
26:41 - shows how he's writing code and so he's
26:44 - saying some crazy stuff like LARP sharp
26:47 - chook and his code is being refactored
26:51 - their arguments that are being added in
26:54 - the parenthesis they're squigglies
26:56 - getting added their semicolons being
26:58 - added in the right place the code is
27:00 - getting indented correctly and I'm
27:02 - sitting there like holy
27:03 - even with two arms and a typing speed of
27:06 - 100 words per minute which is about my
27:08 - typing speed I cannot write how quickly
27:13 - he just wrote that so
27:16 - there are better systems there you know
27:19 - it's only as much of an impediment as
27:21 - you let it be their workarounds and I
27:24 - suggest you look into those workarounds
27:26 - and yeah that's that mm-hmm
27:38 - house I actually thought about making
27:41 - computer programming tutorials in or do
27:43 - or Hindi but maybe on our another
27:44 - channel clever or do.com or something
27:56 - tips and tricks
27:58 - thank you for wishing me happy birthday
28:00 - and yes I am replying to you as well
28:11 - let's see Manish I don't know what time
28:18 - will I tell up will I be online I'm just
28:20 - doing this for fun so if I feel like
28:23 - staying here for a little bit longer
28:24 - I'll stay here if I feel like leaving
28:27 - I'll leave but you know I'm having fun
28:29 - here answering your guys's questions so
28:31 - you know I'm probably gonna be here for
28:33 - a little while longer
28:34 - but you know not the whole day or
28:35 - anything like that thank you so me uh
28:42 - Thank You Luca tax Thank You fourth
28:44 - planet
28:47 - yep programming is thinking and not that
28:49 - much typing 100 percent agreed let's see
28:54 - any more questions questions questions
29:00 - cocka cocka questions let's see
29:10 - yeah I'm gonna do I'm gonna do like life
29:13 - coding for you guys doing live streams
29:15 - we just had a launch and the launch was
29:17 - absolutely insane it was basically the
29:22 - create Python Opie course and you know
29:26 - usually I'll open it up only for a five
29:29 - day period and then I announce it and
29:31 - then it's like everybody goes crazy and
29:33 - you know including everybody a clever
29:36 - programmer and team and all the students
29:39 - and so we got hundreds of new students
29:41 - that joined this time and then the
29:42 - program shut down so now things are
29:45 - calming down a little bit and I was
29:48 - thinking to do some live stream for you
29:49 - guys where I'm coding and you guys just
29:51 - kind of get to watch over my shoulder
29:54 - and see my thought process and
29:56 - everything yeah I just completed all
30:08 - your Python courses do you think it's
30:11 - time to move on to another programming
30:12 - language like JavaScript PS I'm
30:15 - passionate about web development
30:17 - Yussef this is exactly the time my
30:20 - friend where you as garyvee would say
30:23 - you grab Python by the throat
30:26 - this is exactly the time where you use
30:31 - Python and create actual things so now
30:34 - that you are trained I want you to
30:37 - create stuff and you can do web
30:39 - development with Python look into a
30:41 - framework called flask don't start with
30:43 - Django it's too little too complicated
30:45 - and magical especially when you're
30:47 - starting out look into flask and then
30:50 - with flask HTML CSS you'll you can build
30:57 - pretty much anything so you you know
31:00 - full web development stuff and flask is
31:03 - you know not some esoteric framework
31:07 - it's just as popular you know you have
31:10 - Python web developers using flask making
31:13 - hundred over a hundred thousand dollars
31:15 - or averaging around ninety thousand
31:16 - dollars
31:17 - Python has back-end of back-end
31:19 - developers full stack developers
31:21 - front-end developers you know using
31:24 - Python
31:25 - so it's hot and it's trending it's not a
31:29 - risky thing to learn and invest your
31:31 - time in not now and not you know for the
31:34 - next 10 20 years well let's just say
31:37 - five years because things change quickly
31:41 - in the programming world however once
31:44 - you know the concepts you can quickly
31:46 - switch over and print happy birthday
31:54 - let's see what else okay let me answer
31:58 - some more stuff for you guys guys have
32:01 - some juicy questions um okay yeah sure
32:05 - well I can provide some automation
32:07 - Python tutorials thank you Kishore hey
32:19 - bro I'm learning Python but my math is
32:22 - not good so please tell in programming
32:24 - need math Satya asks and basically what
32:27 - he's trying to ask is do you need math
32:28 - in programming and my answer to this
32:31 - question is math helps but you don't
32:33 - need it not at all absolutely not there
32:38 - are too many programmers I know that our
32:40 - terrible math I'm pretty bad at math I
32:44 - can think logically but I'm not very
32:48 - good at math so yeah you don't you don't
32:54 - really need that much math you can be
32:56 - really good in programming it's it's
32:59 - it's like I say it's language almost as
33:03 - a real-life language so you know for
33:07 - learning French or German or doing
33:09 - something creative or learning how to
33:11 - write a bike or learning how to swim you
33:12 - just need to learn that thing and it's
33:14 - not really associated with a bunch of
33:17 - other things it's it's kind of asking do
33:20 - I need to be good at math to swim you
33:24 - don't need to be good at math to swim
33:30 - chase asked when does your program go up
33:33 - chase my program goes up probably in
33:37 - four five
33:38 - five months again maybe longer I'm not
33:40 - sure but what I do is I close the
33:43 - program down and improve it and then I
33:46 - launch it again how old am i well let's
33:50 - just say that 23 sounds way better than
33:53 - 22 thank you gun going Kahlo
34:07 - all of us I've just butchered your name
34:09 - but thank you so much
34:12 - I didn't delete my recent live feeds I
34:15 - just private at them because they're
34:19 - irrelevant now that the course is closed
34:21 - and I might make them live again later
34:24 - but those are generally I only go live
34:27 - during those times and you have to catch
34:28 - it during those times you know that's
34:30 - why it's special yeah so they're gonna
34:33 - be yeah once once it goes off it's it's
34:36 - gone important modules like you are a
34:48 - Lib okay that's a good that's a good
34:49 - question your ellipse sucks that Aditya
34:52 - but I understand what you're saying and
34:54 - I'll definitely make on I'll definitely
34:58 - make videos on programming modules the
35:02 - better one then you are a Lib is
35:04 - requests for Python
35:13 - okay I'm gonna go and play another game
35:16 - of chess and then I'll be back because
35:18 - that's what I feel like doing right now
35:20 - all right so let's go um okay see I'm
35:31 - gonna do three minutes because I can
35:34 - still speak in three minutes whereas one
35:36 - minute I can't speak at all it takes too
35:40 - much of my focus okay let's try one
35:45 - minute you guys will get to see my face
35:47 - be really weird I'll try to be normal on
35:49 - livestream but my face gets all weirded
35:52 - up and yeah I won't be able to talk too
35:59 - much but okay so you can see I have one
36:02 - minute he has one minute and we can lose
36:03 - on time or we can win by checkmating
36:06 - each other so right now I'm just trying
36:08 - to attack his dark square pawns like
36:12 - this one and he takes my knight which is
36:15 - okay I'm just gonna castle here okay
36:18 - whoops I overlooked that I'm dropping a
36:21 - pawn but that's you know that sucks but
36:25 - it's not the end of the world
36:26 - oh that is d5 here this is this is
36:30 - getting really ugly now oh there's maid
36:33 - here so I can't even take that okay so
36:37 - now I'm gonna ready to take this pawn or
36:40 - take here I'm down a piece so meaning
36:43 - that I'll very likely lose this game
36:45 - however I'll try my best to hold on here
36:48 - and and see how I do if he moves his
36:52 - Queen away at any point this Knight will
36:54 - hang he sees that and he stops me so now
36:58 - I'll go here and attack this pawn I'll
37:03 - go back here again to just annoy him
37:08 - okay now my counter play is okay if he
37:11 - wants a draw draw if we repeat position
37:14 - three times in chess it's a draw okay if
37:16 - I take here he basically saying he'll
37:18 - play a rook here and then when my bishop
37:19 - so I cannot allow that I'm just gonna
37:22 - run away
37:25 - now this pond should be in trouble he's
37:34 - gonna take here I think oh okay now no
37:41 - no he's not in on any trouble
37:43 - yet but he is low on time so I just have
37:47 - to play really fast here
37:49 - and I think I can do that did he just
37:52 - mess up yeah if he takes now I have this
37:54 - so I just want a piece one second left
37:58 - okay he's trying to trick me but that
38:00 - doesn't matter
38:01 - ooh checkmate okay that was really good
38:07 - actually
38:08 - so let me explain kind of what took
38:11 - place here who I was able to commentate
38:16 - and everything wow this is really
38:17 - awesome okay so I moved here you know
38:20 - he's not any threat because I'm trying
38:22 - to checkmate him cuz I got my bishop and
38:24 - Queen lined up but he has his knight
38:26 - here looking at it so he's still not in
38:28 - any trouble yet but then he plays this
38:31 - move rook to attack my queen now he's
38:33 - thinking okay I'll move my Queen back
38:35 - because if I take his rook then he just
38:37 - takes it back with the bishop and I'm
38:40 - down a queen and queen is nine points
38:43 - whereas the rook is five points so he's
38:45 - expecting me to move back or take here
38:48 - basically just get off this dangerous
38:49 - diagonal except he missed a tactic which
38:52 - is his back rank is really weak meaning
38:55 - that if his queen is not here if my rook
38:58 - comes down here that's a checkmate
38:59 - his King has no squares and so I
39:02 - exploited that I exploited his back rank
39:05 - weakness and I took his bishop because
39:09 - again you know I'm sacrificing my queen
39:11 - temporarily but if he takes my Queen
39:13 - then rook comes here and that's
39:17 - checkmate it's game over so he tried to
39:20 - waste
39:21 - he was really low on time he had about
39:22 - one second left here he he tried this
39:24 - desperate move rook check to waste my
39:27 - time but doesn't change anything I just
39:29 - take that rook and now if he takes my
39:31 - Queen which he did again rook here is
39:34 - checkmate and he was gonna lose on time
39:37 - anyways he had zero seconds
39:39 - I had eight seconds left but I played
39:42 - Road Caron you know just made it him
39:44 - instead so it was a pretty good game and
39:46 - now I'll come back to answer some
39:47 - questions all right let me do this in
39:51 - the quickest way possible I'm getting
39:54 - good at this live streaming stuff Wow
39:56 - there's like so many different moving
39:58 - parts that I got to keep track of and I
40:00 - think is doing fine all right let's see
40:22 - ah Gonzalo I'm sorry about that I see
40:28 - that you you added them to see them
40:30 - later I got you that some some people
40:40 - man
40:52 - ya never give up that's right knee and
40:54 - auntie Annie asks why do we use while /
40:59 - do-while loops when we have for loop
41:02 - that's a good question for loop is when
41:05 - you know when something ends while loop
41:07 - is when you don't know when something
41:09 - ends so yeah I that's a weird answer I
41:17 - know but you know for example for loops
41:20 - are easier to write I love for loops but
41:25 - while loops are generally you know
41:27 - you'll use them and you don't know when
41:28 - something look for example let's say
41:30 - that you want to play a game that always
41:33 - allows the option of clicking play again
41:35 - at the end so you play a game of
41:38 - tic-tac-toe and then you want it to give
41:40 - you the option of saying play again to
41:41 - start it again you don't know how many
41:44 - times a user that's using your program
41:47 - feels like playing that game they might
41:49 - want to play it thousand times or one
41:51 - time and then close it so you don't want
41:54 - to write a for loop there because in a
41:55 - for loop you might have to say something
41:57 - like for I in range or something like
42:00 - that you know meaning that for 20 times
42:05 - it should say play again for 10 times it
42:07 - should play again but you don't want to
42:08 - hard-code something that says that
42:11 - because you don't know if the user wants
42:12 - to play it 20 times or 10 times or
42:15 - thousand times for one time so you're
42:17 - gonna write a while loop which is pretty
42:19 - much gonna say while true meaning while
42:23 - the player wants to play keep going and
42:25 - as soon as they hit no then the while
42:29 - loop ends so that's an example of a
42:32 - while loop versus a for loop or another
42:35 - while loop might be while not tired from
42:38 - doing push-ups keep going because you
42:40 - don't know how many pushes this person
42:42 - will do or a for loop you can say for I
42:45 - in range 20 keep going meaning for 20
42:48 - push-ups you know keep going until 20
42:50 - push-ups hopefully that gives you a
42:53 - little bit of an intuition and a little
42:57 - bit of an understanding between while
42:58 - loops versus for loops
43:03 - I was gonna say Froot Loops I've been
43:08 - playing chess for a while since I was
43:11 - about 14 or 15 high school played one
43:14 - state championships twice and became top
43:19 - 1% in the world fairly quickly because I
43:22 - am obsessive when I get on something I
43:24 - go all-in baby so yeah where do you live
43:34 - mm-hmm by the way you consolidate you so
43:41 - much I'm humbled to know that I was your
43:44 - inspiration to go back to Python I love
43:47 - hearing that and keep me updated on your
43:49 - progress I'm glad it's been smooth ride
43:52 - so far basic hash function I can't
43:59 - explain that super fast my friend that
44:02 - takes some drawing and screen sharing
44:05 - which I don't have set up right now but
44:09 - Jonathan yeah like they're basically the
44:14 - idea behind hashes is like caches you
44:17 - know see ACH II and it's to help you
44:21 - speed up things to use already existing
44:23 - data ooh
44:26 - Veronica's 16 14 hey if you guys play
44:29 - chess send me a live challenge and I'll
44:32 - play with you you know on Lee chess org
44:36 - I'll play with you there
44:46 - Henry says what should I do after
44:48 - completing my beginners course there are
44:50 - some online videos I have on YouTube you
44:53 - can launch those or straight up you can
44:55 - just try to find some more advanced
44:58 - trainings online on Udacity or a
45:01 - Coursera until of course I relaunch my
45:06 - course in like many months half a year
45:10 - probably and then you know you can join
45:13 - the course then yeah Gonzalo there you
45:21 - go haha ok moronic send me invite my
45:29 - name is Rafa 0 1 which is RAF eh 0 1
45:34 - send me an invite there and I will
45:37 - accept it and then we will play online
45:40 - and everybody will watch me play against
45:43 - somebody who's in our livestream how
45:46 - freaking cool is that it's basically
45:49 - more onic we're basically gonna be like
45:51 - hanging out on my birthday you know just
45:54 - one on one you know sitting back and
45:57 - drinking some monster and playing some
45:59 - chess
46:12 - Jason Owens the best framework for
46:15 - someone new to Python is flask
46:19 - not Django foreknew not Django
46:23 - I'm not Grandmaster and chess moronic
46:26 - I wish Veronica I don't see your invite
46:33 - my friend my user name is Rafa 0-1 send
46:36 - me an invite I wonder if you guys can
46:42 - hear me gulping when I'm drinking
46:43 - monster it's almost like an ad
46:54 - let me get sponsored by monster
47:03 - hmm
47:11 - Sahil are gufa function is used to parse
47:19 - command-line arguments let me put on my
47:25 - smart glasses so args is used to powers
47:31 - command-line arguments meaning that you
47:34 - can pass in an argument to your function
47:36 - right from your command line without
47:40 - having to hard-coded into your Python
47:44 - script you can pass that argument as
47:47 - your about to call that script from your
47:50 - command line
47:51 - hopefully that confused you I'm I'm
47:55 - pretty good at understanding what
47:58 - somebody will understand or not and that
48:01 - while the words make sense I don't think
48:04 - you'll actually understand what I'm
48:05 - saying until I show you which I can't do
48:08 - right now in this live stream because I
48:10 - don't have the coding stuff set up here
48:12 - I do like stuff like astrophysics or
48:21 - genetic engineering I'm terrible at them
48:24 - but I'm very curious about those
48:25 - concepts which is why I'll watch these
48:27 - videos by this one guy who's always
48:30 - doing these documentaries on physics and
48:33 - he's explaining all this amazing stuff I
48:35 - forgot his name
48:37 - Tyron Woodley no no that's not I I don't
48:43 - know his name I'm gonna stop guessing I
48:47 - don't have a friend request from you my
48:50 - friend are you sending me a friend
48:52 - request or what I don't see a friend
48:56 - request I'm looking at my inbox I'm
49:01 - looking at everything I don't have a
49:03 - friend request
49:10 - no it's not rough is its raw fate RAF
49:13 - ages zero one like this look I wrote it
49:15 - for you okay let's see what other people
49:20 - are saying let's see interest sensor
49:29 - some interesting questions chase yeah
49:38 - it's it's like think of it like a movie
49:40 - launch you know and it's it comes to the
49:44 - theaters and then it goes away from the
49:46 - theaters and that's how this course
49:48 - works I closed it down because then I
49:51 - want to focus on the group that's inside
49:52 - the course and I want to focus on the
49:54 - course material and improving it and
49:56 - then once it's improved and that cohort
49:59 - kind of goes through that entire course
50:01 - and completes it then I will open it up
50:03 - again for a few days
50:05 - okay so I'll open up it up again in a
50:08 - few months for a few days if you're on
50:11 - my email list basically if you enroll in
50:14 - one of my free courses at clever
50:15 - programmer comm you'll find out all of
50:18 - this information alright let's see a
50:27 - fifteen minute game I don't want to play
50:30 - a fifteen minute game let's play a
50:33 - shorter time frame because it will take
50:38 - too long so I'm gonna cancel this but
50:40 - I'll send you a shorter time control the
50:50 - fans will be like this game is way too
50:52 - long
50:54 - alright so let's do this okay I'm
50:57 - sending you sending your rated
50:59 - three-minute match and let's play
51:12 - so but this guy he's not accepting my
51:13 - challenge what's going on
51:19 - future billionaire here well let's see
51:23 - hopefully gotta get to a million first
51:28 - million dollars is really not that hard
51:30 - like I don't know why people make it
51:32 - sound that hard it's so it's very simple
51:37 - it's very hard if you try to just do it
51:40 - by yourself and like you know by just
51:44 - doing jobs that's what makes it
51:46 - difficult as long as your hours are tied
51:50 - to the amount of money you make it's
51:52 - very difficult and life is very
51:55 - difficult you need to break the chains
51:57 - of work and what you're paid for and if
52:04 - if the only way you can make more money
52:06 - is by working more hours you're gonna be
52:08 - stuck in that cycle for the rest of your
52:09 - life and it's a pretty weird cycle maybe
52:12 - you like it I don't I like being able to
52:15 - do stuff on my own time but if you can
52:19 - find a way where the amount of money are
52:24 - making is not associated with the amount
52:25 - of time you're putting in now you're
52:27 - getting into a very good lifestyle which
52:30 - is why when you're doing when you're
52:32 - doing freelancing or consultations I
52:35 - highly recommend you're not sending me
52:44 - the challenges okay I'm gonna try one
52:47 - more time and if I if you don't accept
52:49 - it then I'm gonna play online with
52:51 - somebody else but okay anyways let me
52:53 - finish my thoughts so the reason why I
52:57 - yeah so what I suggest when you're doing
52:59 - freelancing or when you're consulting is
53:02 - you don't focus on setting hourly rates
53:07 - because that by definition ties you to
53:13 - the hours you should try to set result
53:18 - value-based pricing is called
53:20 - value-based pricing and go and learn
53:23 - more about it but
53:25 - that's the type of pricing where you're
53:28 - not charging hourly but you're charging
53:31 - based on a project and it doesn't matter
53:34 - if that project takes you two hours or
53:37 - one week it's just one price so if you
53:41 - get better at it you can do it in like
53:43 - three hours and send it to them
53:44 - completed like for example if somebody
53:46 - tells you to put together a website for
53:48 - them and they want to pay you $5,000 for
53:50 - it and that's the price you guys agree
53:52 - on it doesn't matter it shouldn't matter
53:56 - if you make the website in two hours or
53:58 - take three weeks to make it right that's
54:00 - where your proficiency and skill and how
54:03 - effective you are that comes into play
54:06 - and that starts to break you from the
54:08 - bonds of your hours with the money
54:11 - you're making and then you want to try
54:13 - to find you know after that you want to
54:16 - try to find higher paying clients who
54:18 - have the money don't bother yourself
54:20 - with petty shitty clients like I did for
54:25 - a while I worked with this lady and to
54:28 - this day she gives me nightmares even
54:30 - thinking about it like me and my friend
54:32 - worked our ass off we built everything
54:35 - from scratch like spent 40 hours working
54:38 - on it and you know we wanted to put
54:41 - something on our portfolio and we're
54:43 - like it's gonna be awesome is gonna be
54:44 - so good and after spending like 40 hours
54:47 - or something or more she wanted to pass
54:51 - not even not even three hundred dollars
54:55 - and she made us do like five or seven
54:57 - revisions and we were giving her like
55:01 - that was chump change like I was used to
55:04 - charging clients for that amount over
55:05 - like the five thousand ten thousand
55:06 - dollars and for her I was doing it for
55:08 - cheaper because I at that time I didn't
55:11 - have experience and didn't have a
55:12 - portfolio it didn't have resume so I was
55:14 - like okay I'll do something for cheaper
55:15 - as long as I can build a portfolio and
55:17 - resume but you see the problem that I
55:21 - had there was that I was going to
55:24 - somebody who didn't have money right she
55:29 - wasn't as much as I hated her and then
55:32 - to this day it still makes me angry that
55:35 - somebody would work somebody did that
55:37 - level and just grind them out
55:39 - and not even pay them anything yes she
55:42 - by the way she didn't pay us anything we
55:44 - made no money after 40 hours of work you
55:50 - know the lesson that I learned is go to
55:52 - the people that have money don't go to
55:57 - people who don't have money because it
56:01 - doesn't matter how good harder to they
56:03 - heart they are or how amazing they are
56:05 - you know there's there's no way that
56:07 - they can pay you even if they love you
56:11 - all right I'm gonna go and accept this
56:13 - challenge now Oh somebody else
56:22 - challenged me okay cool
56:24 - moronic I'll play you in a little bit
56:26 - but looks like somebody challenged me
56:29 - here okay guys so I'm playing against
56:37 - somebody on the on the livestream
56:41 - let me ask them so I just sent out a
56:46 - message saying hey did you come here
56:47 - from the livestream and we're playing oh
56:50 - okay cool
56:57 - this person is 1,300 that's really or
57:01 - 1,400 sorry it's a really good reading
57:03 - and let's see how does the game goes
57:08 - so he's developing his pieces that's
57:13 - really good you know you want to control
57:15 - the center and he's doing that you know
57:16 - every move he's playing like look at
57:18 - that pawn here Knights controlling this
57:20 - one this square brilliant chess Bishop
57:23 - here so all of these four squares every
57:25 - move that he's making they're being
57:27 - controlled you know even his queen is
57:28 - controlling those squares and I'm trying
57:30 - to do the same thing in chess you can
57:33 - make this move called castling this is
57:34 - the only time you can move your king and
57:37 - rook at the same time so that's what I'm
57:39 - gonna do you know I'm just gonna play it
57:40 - a little bit safe here he's moves his
57:43 - Bishop here to pressure my knight and
57:47 - you know I have a few options here but
57:50 - I'm just gonna say okay
57:53 - I had take my knight and he says no sir
57:56 - I don't want to take your knight and
57:58 - I'll say okay I'll just kick his Bishop
58:02 - again and then just defend this pawn so
58:07 - he let me expand a little bit on the
58:10 - Queen side which you know is I'm happy
58:13 - with and I'm gonna trade my knight for
58:17 - his Bishop because in chess in middle
58:23 - game if you can get a bishop pair it's
58:26 - usually considered advantageous for the
58:28 - side that has the two bishops hmm
58:35 - there's also Knight c5 in the position
58:38 - this is an interesting position there's
58:40 - nine takes b6 there's also Knight c5 I
58:42 - like Knight c5 mmm I'm gonna play Knight
58:46 - c5 and just just cramp down on him here
58:49 - a little bit still nobody really has you
58:55 - know a huge edge or anything like that
58:57 - it's a pretty closed position okay he
59:02 - decides to take now I can I can take
59:05 - whichever way I want I'm gonna take this
59:07 - way because I want to be able to
59:09 - pressure his it's funny cuz he's hearing
59:12 - all of this so he knows exactly what I'm
59:14 - gonna be doing but it's okay I'm gonna
59:17 - try to pressure this B file here and and
59:23 - let's see how he reacts to this
59:37 - okay I can attack his night which is
59:41 - it's pretty uncomfortable move to deal
59:44 - with it actually I'll see where he goes
60:03 - my pieces are getting a little bit
60:06 - inside of his position which can be a
60:10 - little bit annoying sometimes and I'm
60:15 - just gonna I can also play C six and
60:19 - then a six I move my bishop back he
60:22 - takes a pawn if I move here he can play
60:24 - b5 okay so I'm just gonna try to squeeze
60:30 - him a little bit here and make him a
60:32 - little restricted with his pieces and
60:34 - try to control more squares on the Queen
60:37 - side so he has some light square
60:38 - weaknesses here you know there are lots
60:40 - of light squares my pieces can get into
60:43 - that's kind of what I'm focusing on here
60:51 - so there's a lot of time left he has
60:54 - three minutes have two minutes 49
60:55 - seconds it's also possible we can get
60:57 - under time trouble and things could
61:00 - start you know going a little bit wrong
61:02 - for us now I think I'm just going to
61:09 - take here he has a better pawn structure
61:13 - that's one of the advantages that he has
61:15 - right now
61:27 - but I am I do want to actually oh wait
61:31 - is bishop c6 here really good
61:33 - did he just miss that I can just play so
61:36 - if I play here and attack his knight and
61:38 - if his knight ever moved I can take his
61:40 - rook that's probably really good there's
61:42 - also c6 there's also 96 too many choices
61:45 - here Knight here it looks pretty good
61:47 - too he can go Queen e8
61:49 - oh wow after Knight here he can go
61:55 - Queenie and or Queen d7 and in either
61:59 - case I can do Knight takes a 7 there are
62:06 - too many choices here too many choices I
62:10 - think I'm just gonna go Bishop c6 it
62:13 - looks like the simplest way to go I mean
62:18 - he can he can look to sack the exchange
62:20 - meaning he can move his knight and let
62:24 - me take his rook but I like my position
62:27 - better there I think I have winning
62:30 - chances but this is one of those things
62:36 - that happen you know so this is what I
62:38 - was talking about I get these light
62:39 - squares and he's gonna be oh very smart
62:43 - so he actually attacks my queen and
62:46 - breaks the pin at the same time so he is
62:50 - actually a genius I should have done the
62:53 - other thing all right all right
62:57 - no stress I'm just gonna play some solid
63:01 - chess here control squares it's gonna be
63:04 - up a pawn but I'd like to think I have
63:07 - some compensation here
63:15 - okay so he takes there that's expected
63:30 - hmm I am getting a little bit under time
63:34 - pressure here so I do need to keep
63:36 - playing fast he's playing incredibly
63:40 - well
63:55 - okay now I think there's might be some
63:58 - stuff going on on the C file okay if I
64:03 - take here he just takes back but I have
64:08 - 96 right attacking the Queen and the
64:11 - rook so I'm I have a disadvantage right
64:16 - now I'm down multiple pawns but it looks
64:18 - like I'm gonna get my exchange back what
64:22 - about rook here take stakes yeah rook
64:25 - here looks really good and if he don't I
64:29 - just win his rook okay so it looks like
64:35 - he messed up a little bit I think unless
64:38 - he has some resource here but it looks
64:40 - like he won't be able to actually defend
64:42 - this rook at all meaning he can't go
64:48 - Queen here because his queen is under
64:50 - attacks but he can't go Queen here too
64:54 - to defend his rook because I have Knight
64:56 - takes Queen and if he moves his queen
64:59 - let's say here then I can actually take
65:05 - his rook and just be up a rook and I
65:09 - think that's exactly what I'm going to
65:12 - do here
65:36 - I'm gonna play some weird tactical moves
65:39 - here that are gonna give him some
65:41 - trouble and let's see what he depending
65:44 - on what he plays but I have a move in
65:47 - mind that actually so this is a very
65:51 - annoying move to deal with under time
65:52 - pressure yeah so I just want more
65:58 - material there
65:59 - I have rook check here coming which is
66:01 - actually mate if he doesn't watch out
66:04 - for it I'll defend my pawn so he can't
66:08 - take my pawn with his knight he has five
66:10 - seconds left I'm up material so he looks
66:14 - like he's in a lot of trouble yes check
66:17 - but I'll just go back okay very good
66:21 - game it was very very well played
66:33 - and so I think he played really well I
66:41 - just think he got a little bit greedy by
66:43 - taking this pawn I don't I don't think
66:45 - you should take this pawn more natural
66:48 - moves are night here getting his night
66:50 - in the game yeah this this move looks
66:55 - really good he just needs to bring more
66:57 - pieces so he has a lot of activity but
67:01 - he chose instead to take my pawn which
67:04 - then brings this rook to life and he has
67:08 - to watch out for that and also I'm I'm I
67:13 - was looking to clear this Bishop from
67:14 - here so I can land the knight here and
67:16 - he actually allows me to do that and
67:20 - then he and then he gets in a little bit
67:23 - of trouble here okay so really good game
67:26 - and if anybody else wants to challenge
67:28 - I'll accept it and I'm gonna come back
67:30 - and answer your guys questions now okay
67:36 - cool cool cool cool Trump Donald nice
67:50 - chess it's to leech s org allied chess
67:55 - org it's like this and you can actually
67:59 - just go there and play any time it's
68:01 - free let's see somebody else sent me o
68:06 - moronic now sent me a challenge so I'm
68:09 - gonna go and play a challenge with him
68:12 - and then I'll come answer your guys's
68:14 - questions in a second okay
68:19 - so Austin Chang asked me a question
68:21 - Austin is actually in my course he's
68:24 - also on my snapchat which is super cool
68:27 - and he just asked me a question in
68:29 - livestream so I'm gonna answer that and
68:32 - he says if you make a website app for
68:34 - someone and get paid do you are you
68:36 - expected to maintain the site and fix it
68:38 - if something goes wrong I am very clear
68:40 - with my clients about this most of the
68:43 - times I
68:44 - want to deal with headache and me on the
68:46 - call so I will generally make it very
68:49 - clear that once we are done with the
68:52 - deal and they get what they need that's
68:56 - it like I'm out and if something goes
68:58 - wrong they should try to fix it but
69:01 - generally I will make sure that it's
69:03 - very clear I'll bring in a team of
69:06 - testers as third party unit testers and
69:09 - these people will test and make sure
69:12 - everything is working fine it's almost
69:14 - as if you know when you have that if you
69:17 - get into a car accident yeah you know
69:20 - you can call in a third party to
69:22 - unbiased ly look at what happened and
69:25 - like who gets how much money or who was
69:28 - at fault it's sort of like that so it's
69:31 - basically my insurance policy kind of
69:33 - thing you know I'll bring in third party
69:35 - unit testers and they'll test out
69:37 - everything they'll communicate with me
69:39 - they'll communicate with my client and
69:41 - then we part ways because I don't want
69:43 - to deal with that headache unless you're
69:45 - charging them monthly something for it
69:48 - you know $2,000 $4,000 I don't know
69:50 - whatever to you know if something goes
69:53 - wrong it's part of the contract or you
69:55 - can charge them an extra premium in the
69:58 - proposal so then when something like
70:02 - that comes up you're okay with it
70:03 - because you charge that extra premium
70:05 - and they paid it upfront so you can just
70:09 - give them life time like you know
70:11 - maintenance and you also have to
70:12 - understand which clients are working
70:14 - where there's some nasty stingy clients
70:16 - those are the clients you fire and don't
70:19 - work with in the start you want to work
70:22 - obviously I'll try to get any work that
70:25 - you can but try to be very respect
70:28 - yourself don't let shitty people destroy
70:32 - your life there are a lot of people like
70:35 - that who are very stingy watch over
70:38 - every little thing that you do always
70:39 - stay over your shoulder there to always
70:42 - complain and blame will never give you
70:44 - compliments if you do something right or
70:46 - respect you you know or you know so
70:51 - basically watch out for those types of
70:52 - people if you have good clients you'll
70:55 - know that even if you give them lifetime
70:57 - maintenance
70:58 - they're not gonna bother you for no
71:00 - reason unless there's really something
71:02 - wrong so those are the people you cannot
71:04 - be okay with giving them like okay I'll
71:06 - give you maintenance if anything goes
71:08 - wrong but the type of people who's
71:09 - exploited and take advantage of it those
71:12 - are the people you know you really want
71:15 - to run away from just like one of my
71:17 - clients who like literally used and
71:20 - abused us didn't pay us money at the end
71:22 - of the day and had us do like seven or
71:24 - eight revisions even though we were
71:26 - supposed to do only like maybe one
71:28 - revision like we were doing her a favor
71:29 - the entire time okay
71:37 - hopefully that answers the question Rudy
71:44 - that was a really good game you know
71:48 - yeah maybe you were nervous but you
71:51 - shouldn't be because you play really
71:52 - well you only made very few mistakes
72:01 - okay now Marana keeps sending me the
72:03 - challenge so I'm gonna go and accept his
72:05 - challenge and play a moronic moronic is
72:07 - also in the live chat right now so he's
72:09 - actually somebody who's in the live chat
72:11 - sending me a challenge and I'll play him
72:13 - if you guys want to send me a challenge
72:14 - it's my birthday and I'll play you I
72:17 - don't care it's fun all right let's go
72:32 - okay he's not playing let's go come on
72:49 - let's go moronic okay good good good
72:56 - good he finally played he says hi in the
72:58 - chat nice okay so now maybe we're gonna
73:02 - play a joke Oh piano I don't know let's
73:04 - see what he chooses to play here I'm
73:08 - gonna be right back I'm gonna make a
73:10 - quick call
73:10 - and I'll be right back you don't need to
73:13 - give me any extra time or anything this
73:16 - move is not accurate so you want to
73:19 - change that after this game and I'll
73:20 - show you why I'm gonna be back in a
73:23 - second okay
75:40 - all right what's up fellas I'm getting
75:43 - calls for my birthday so I have to go
75:46 - and take them sometimes it's okay you
75:48 - don't need to give me extra time thank
75:49 - you though I appreciate it okay so I'm
76:02 - gonna take here and the idea is that if
76:08 - he takes my night I fork him right and
76:12 - if he takes here I take here and I still
76:15 - get the center basically black is trying
76:20 - to control the center and if black can
76:21 - play these two moves a 5 and d5 black
76:25 - has a quality pretty much so that's
76:27 - really what I'm going for
76:28 - now I have a feeling we'll get a pretty
76:30 - sharp game and let's see how he deals
76:35 - with this move and I think now it's
76:38 - gonna get very tactical because his
76:41 - knights hanging hanging but my Knights
76:43 - hanging and if he takes my knight and
76:44 - take him back he takes here it's a fork
76:46 - he's looking at my king in my rook so
76:51 - let's see how moronic deals with it I
76:53 - won't do too many calculations because
76:55 - then again then he knows exactly what
76:57 - I'm calculating but you know I'll try to
77:00 - calculate more after the game and show
77:02 - you guys some of this stuff and and yeah
77:15 - I'm gonna be playing at a chess
77:17 - tournament this weekend it's gonna be a
77:19 - really huge tournament and people from
77:25 - all over the world actually come to play
77:26 - there um I'm wondering if I could take
77:30 - there here here here I mean why can't I
77:38 - just on passant and keep this oh my
77:42 - queen is hanging it oh my god okay
77:45 - ah I almost played pawn takes here but
77:47 - just realize my Queens hanging okay well
77:52 - I don't have a choice
77:56 - process of elimination my friend the
78:00 - ultimate process that's how I do coating
78:02 - as well process of elimination I'm
78:05 - wondering if I can play here you played
78:09 - there I play here no no no that I can't
78:11 - go there that doesn't make sense
78:14 - um this position is annoying let's see I
78:26 - can go there
78:31 - [Music]
78:37 - okay okay let's say I go here and just
78:48 - put more pressure on him what is
78:54 - happening here this is a it's a
78:56 - complicated position they're a bunch of
78:58 - things going on and basically we both
79:01 - have to figure it out you know we don't
79:04 - know what moves to play and we're trying
79:07 - to figure our way out of this
79:09 - complication so you place queen there
79:12 - which is a mistake
79:16 - [Music]
79:28 - just gonna calculate it one more time
79:32 - yeah I should be fine here yeah it was
79:36 - already defended so he didn't need to do
79:38 - that
79:52 - I love a bunch of pawns here
80:07 - but I am very low on time maybe I should
80:12 - just play it fast here
80:19 - whatever oh my god I'm an idiot okay
80:31 - that's the move I should not have played
80:34 - yeah because of that but okay let's look
80:38 - for some counter play I I'm really long
80:40 - time 30 seconds left and it looks like
80:43 - he's about to get the advantage what
80:46 - what am i doing I should have taken his
80:51 - this is just bad that's what it is okay
80:56 - 26 seconds to 2 minutes and 37 seconds
80:59 - he looks to be in a better position I do
81:03 - have a bunch of pawns for the trouble
81:07 - but I am I'm getting in a lot of trouble
81:10 - right now so I'm just gonna get out of
81:11 - the way really long time really
81:16 - suffering here not doing good at all
81:20 - let's see what he's got planned next
81:32 - surely poor time management on my part
81:35 - okay so he's attacking here when I
81:37 - attacked there he has struts of going
81:41 - Bishop there but you know the pressure
81:43 - my c7 pond I think I should be okay
81:48 - we'll see this is a very tough position
81:54 - here for me and more than position the
82:04 - time is a huge factor
82:18 - okay
82:27 - hopefully I'm not allowing any tactical
82:29 - shots here because I would get in a lot
82:32 - of trouble if I do so I have 11 seconds
82:39 - here's one minute 13 seconds he wants to
82:42 - trade in two opposite colored bishop
82:45 - endgame but um I'm on his f2 pawn so I'm
82:49 - not sure how he wants to deal with that
82:52 - Oh sneaky sneaky he's trying to mate me
82:55 - in the back rank okay oh wait that's
83:02 - that doesn't make any sense
83:04 - I thought that move was so good but it's
83:07 - not it's too much time trouble actually
83:33 - yeah so he knows I'm pretty much done
83:37 - here especially with the time trouble
83:40 - that I'm in
83:58 - oh okay good game good game here I miss
84:03 - my chance I kept thinking about this but
84:06 - I so I lost the game he played really
84:09 - well and great game great game so here's
84:15 - where it really happened so the reason
84:22 - why I played here was so I could play
84:23 - here next but then for some reason I
84:26 - forgot but yeah I should just play here
84:27 - he takes my pawn I take his pawn in and
84:30 - then it's a draw but good game very nice
84:34 - let's see if we have new challengers we
84:38 - have another challenger Lara fall and
84:42 - I'm gonna play one game with her and
84:44 - moronic I think we need to play a
84:46 - rematch my friend will play a rematch at
84:48 - some point great game though great game
85:08 - okay let's see if there's any new
85:11 - questions how were you one direction
85:13 - yeah I get that
85:15 - Zayn all right cool
85:26 - now let's go and play the game okay ooh
85:33 - that's an interesting move
85:40 - [Music]
85:50 - checkmate
85:54 - be careful about pushing this pawn in
85:57 - this pawn Laura and are you are you in
86:02 - livestream I mean you have to be I think
86:04 - pretty sure so okay so basically be
86:09 - careful about pushing this pawn and this
86:11 - pawn because you can get in some trouble
86:14 - like that check a median criminis game I
86:19 - didn't realize no no how they're five
86:21 - minutes 16 seconds okay cool
86:24 - anybody else wants a challenge go ahead
86:26 - we'll play another game oh I gotta close
86:36 - this maybe I'm not so good at this
86:38 - livestream thingy alright let's go down
86:45 - yeah I'm answering questions about
86:47 - coating as well Karl so few questions
86:50 - for coating I will do that ratchet says
86:53 - for the first time in my life I was
86:54 - enjoying chess cool I'll also make some
86:57 - kind of chess game for you guys Muhammad
87:04 - says cause you started learning Python
87:06 - for like 3 weeks but then it got hard
87:08 - and there are a few places and then I
87:11 - stopped
87:13 - look you can't stop when things get
87:16 - difficult there are tons of online
87:20 - resources but focus on making it
87:23 - enjoyable so then even if it's hard
87:25 - you'll still do it for example I don't
87:30 - know your relationship with your wife if
87:32 - you have a wife you know things get
87:34 - really difficult but you enjoy spending
87:35 - your time with her so you'll still go
87:39 - through very difficult things to do that
87:41 - and you won't just stop you know if you
87:46 - like eating cake you'll travel really
87:49 - far to Cheesecake Factory to get that
87:52 - delicious cheesecake or that extremely
87:55 - good fried rice at your favorite Thai
87:57 - place you know even if it's really hard
88:00 - you'll still keep going so as long as
88:02 - the thing that
88:02 - doing is enjoyable that's why really
88:04 - focus on making it something you enjoy
88:06 - that's why I always say 80 15-5 rule
88:10 - which is play 80% of the time build 15%
88:14 - of the time and learn 5 percent of the
88:15 - time reduce your time learning and get
88:17 - naturally good at it by playing with it
88:19 - and getting a feel for it to play me go
88:23 - to leech s org and just send me an
88:26 - invite my user my username is Rafa's or
88:31 - one and then you can play me like that
88:34 - on leech s no GS is really good I prefer
88:39 - Django so I would go with Django but
88:41 - there's nothing wrong with no Jess or
88:43 - Django they're both really really good
88:45 - it just depends if you are already
88:48 - skilled at Python then maybe go for
88:50 - Django and if you're more skilled with
88:52 - JavaScript then maybe go with node J s
88:55 - both of them are server-side you know
88:59 - frameworks mm-hmm
89:03 - any new challenges no new challenges
89:15 - yeah I'll make a chassis eye and let it
89:17 - play for me actually
89:21 - okay moronic um let's see okay if
89:26 - nobody's sending me in our match from
89:29 - here I'm just gonna play against
89:30 - somebody online so let me know if you
89:35 - guys are gonna be doing that or not
89:38 - alright so I'm gonna play against
89:40 - somebody online play you know it's much
89:48 - harder to play and commentate than I
89:51 - thought it's definitely much more
89:53 - difficult because I'm always thinking
89:55 - I'm used to thinking quietly especially
89:59 - when I'm playing at a tournament in a
90:00 - very quiet but I got it you know it's
90:03 - just a skill I have to practice it so
90:04 - the more out I think out loud the better
90:07 - I'll get at it
90:08 - now he's starting to make some
90:10 - weaknesses in g3 and f2 but I think he
90:13 - knows the opening that he's playing if I
90:15 - take Knight c5 looks really good I'm
90:17 - gonna do that even though it's supposed
90:19 - to be slightly more passive for me you
90:21 - know I'm I am okay with this position
90:24 - because there's this long diagonal play
90:27 - that I get and I'm gonna try to exploit
90:29 - that diagonal now I wonder but I can
90:37 - play Knight h5 and we just trade a bunch
90:40 - of pieces I kind of I like don't mind
90:43 - this line at all I'm on here my Knights
90:47 - coming to places maybe and I mean yeah
90:53 - sure those straight Queens as well I
90:55 - don't care so we've traded down quite a
90:59 - bit
91:05 - okay now I'm trying to poke at his queen
91:09 - side so I can take take and then open up
91:11 - some position there night of four looks
91:16 - pretty night each four looks good to me
91:21 - I can also take take and put a ruck on
91:26 - the C file so there there's multiple
91:29 - ways to go about it there's 92 and 94
91:32 - it's my maneuver here which she
91:37 - overlooked so I like my night on this
91:43 - square and it's actually a little bit
91:46 - tricky for him to challenge my night I
91:49 - should have actually put this rook on
91:51 - the B file because if he ever it takes I
91:53 - can take okay now he's getting oh that's
91:55 - why he played rook here so he's ready to
91:58 - challenge my knight um I'm gonna play
92:03 - here I'm okay with this all his pawns
92:10 - are on light squares so if we trade
92:12 - nights it should be okay for me in this
92:15 - position also playing Knight d5 and
92:25 - that's okay because now I just have a
92:28 - superior night so I was superior minor
92:30 - piece and all his pawns are on light
92:33 - squares which means his bishop has low
92:35 - mobility and I mean I'm just better here
92:40 - to be honest he like might have to
92:42 - sacrifice in exchange but there's no way
92:43 - to kick this Knight
92:44 - he can't do anything to this Knight so
92:46 - this Knight is just dominating and it's
92:48 - on a dark square so this Bishop would
92:49 - never take him now ruk is five points so
92:52 - he doesn't want to give up a rook for
92:54 - the night because rook is worth five
92:56 - points in Knights three points I also
92:59 - have Knight a5 at some point I wonder if
93:04 - I can play f5 here okay let's see I can
93:07 - play h5 take stakes take over they take
93:10 - over the h-file but I don't see well all
93:15 - I have to do I think to win is just
93:17 - trade down
93:19 - trade all the pieces till is just a
93:22 - night in a bishop and then I think my
93:24 - night should prove to be you know prove
93:30 - enough for a for a win I always have
93:35 - night f5 here he has to be careful about
93:37 - that so yeah okay so this is guys
93:46 - hanging I have to protect him for a
93:48 - second
93:49 - it's night c2 in the position okay again
93:56 - rook e8 threatening Knight f5 so if he
93:58 - plays that five I just take it that's
94:04 - you know he messed up here and then
94:07 - there's Knight h4 at some point if he is
94:10 - not careful yeah I'll just take this
94:16 - pawn and there's g5 and then Knight g6
94:21 - 95 yeah I should be okay here I'm just
94:25 - up to pawns I have 40 seconds just 57
94:27 - seconds it just means I need now need to
94:30 - play quicker to win this I'm gonna make
94:34 - this my last game and then I'll answer
94:35 - some questions that you guys have
94:38 - there's Knight a5 again if he goes to e3
94:46 - then I can go to night of 594 and one in
94:49 - one smooth motion there's still night of
94:54 - five because I have rookie 3 so I will
94:57 - actually play that because I rookie 3
94:59 - and then I can actually take this guy
95:02 - here like that
95:04 - then there's rook h2 and now I'm
95:15 - threatening mate idea so he might need
95:17 - to trade a rock or two with me okay
95:21 - sure nice rock is hanging and I'm
95:23 - threatening mate I mean this is pretty
95:24 - reasonable for him he should just resign
95:28 - here there's nothing he can do it Moses
95:31 - Rock I just take
95:32 - if you move this rook oh yeah he can
95:35 - actually move this rook here or that
95:39 - that's fine so now I'm threatening to
95:43 - take here or rook here he has two
95:45 - seconds left I have 20 seconds really
95:50 - difficult position for him yeah I should
95:54 - actually just go here and here
95:56 - threatening to take here so and once he
95:58 - takes I take or yeah take this way and
96:00 - then I have passed pawns okay so I want
96:03 - this game yeah really the critical
96:07 - moments are you know this idea that
96:10 - because in chess you don't always have
96:13 - like a really obvious advantage you know
96:15 - when you're playing at a higher level
96:16 - that's not only about checkmating the
96:18 - other person you have to try to win some
96:20 - material but even more than that
96:22 - sometimes even winning material is not
96:24 - that easy so you have to find different
96:26 - ideas and right now my idea was okay my
96:29 - Knights really good all his pawns are on
96:31 - light squares which is not a good idea
96:34 - for him because it blocks in is at his
96:35 - own bishop as you can see that my lights
96:39 - my knights on dark square so it's just a
96:42 - better piece than this guy cuz he can't
96:44 - even take me and it's protected just an
96:46 - outpost in the center of the board so
96:48 - all I have to do is actually open up
96:52 - this h-file and then get my rooks in the
96:55 - game and then trade my rooks and then
96:57 - just be with King King and Night vs
96:59 - Bishop or I'm better and it was really
97:03 - this key maneuver that I think you know
97:06 - won the game is here here and this one
97:10 - right here you know so subtle moves but
97:15 - definitely you know very powerful and
97:18 - important to keep in mind I also missed
97:24 - a lot of things for example this pawn is
97:26 - pinned so I can take here and once he
97:28 - takes back I can take with the knight
97:30 - and once he takes I can take his Bishop
97:32 - so there are a bunch of things I missed
97:34 - too in the game but okay that's it for
97:37 - this game I have a challenge from Justin
97:40 - I don't want to play ten minutes with
97:43 - eight seconds my friend that is very
97:45 - long let's try to do five minutes so
97:49 - send me another challenge Mazur
97:51 - I definitely don't upload unlimited time
97:53 - so please send me a challenge with five
97:55 - minutes okay so I'm gonna decline these
97:57 - right now
97:58 - but I want to play with you just make
98:01 - them a little bit shorter in the
98:03 - meantime I'll jump over try to answer
98:04 - some programming stuff questions and
98:07 - then we'll come back here and play some
98:09 - some chests with you guys so let me jump
98:11 - back into the livestream here
98:23 - okay yeah I wish Kasparov was here -
98:29 - yeah you can go to my course on clever
98:34 - programmer dot teachable calm and that's
98:39 - where all the courses are located and
98:44 - then we'll play
98:56 - no challenges huh okay so make sure that
99:00 - you can send me a challenge Austin
99:02 - I forgot what your name was here I can't
99:06 - find it anywhere
99:07 - things like Austin Jay Austin I don't
99:11 - know I totally forgot
99:12 - Austin oh my god there's so many
99:16 - Austin's I'll never have luck finding
99:19 - you here okay so let's see what do you
99:30 - recommend
99:30 - after I finished learning Python PHP or
99:33 - JavaScript
99:34 - if you finish learning Python I thought
99:36 - I would have you focus on actually
99:38 - developing real apps and real useful
99:41 - things with pythons because if you're
99:44 - done learning now the whole point of
99:45 - being done with learning is so now you
99:47 - can do the really enjoyable stuff which
99:49 - is actually creating things and bring
99:50 - your ideas to life but if you're just
99:52 - interested in learning another language
99:54 - after Python outside JavaScript and not
99:56 - PHP PHP sucks okay I'm gonna go and now
100:02 - play the game so I got the challenge I'm
100:08 - an accept Justin's challenge Jay Austin
100:11 - sorry and now you guys should be able to
100:19 - see
100:30 - okay Austin good luck so he opens with
100:34 - the King pawn that's a really good move
100:38 - he's controlling the center he moves his
100:41 - knight out again controlling the center
100:44 - the entire time
100:45 - very good I don't actually know what his
100:48 - rating is so the amount of time he's
100:58 - taking on this move I would guess that
101:00 - maybe his rating is like 900 800 like
101:03 - maybe he's really new to chess because
101:11 - this is actually known as the Scotch
101:13 - defense so if you're familiar with it
101:16 - you would play these moves pretty fast
101:17 - now on his Knight I have two pieces
101:27 - attacking the knight he has one piece
101:29 - defending it which means that if he
101:31 - doesn't move it then I could win it but
101:33 - he could also just choose to protect it
101:35 - which is exactly what he did
101:38 - I'm gonna go and pressure that night a
101:40 - little bit more when I tickle that night
101:56 - getting lots of calls and have your bird
101:59 - the emails is beautiful thank you guys
102:01 - so much I really appreciate it I know
102:03 - that some of you guys who were emailing
102:04 - me are also in this livestream which is
102:09 - amazing thank you thank you thank you
102:11 - bishop here is a tricky move why can't I
102:15 - just take take and take I'm gonna win
102:18 - upon I will do that so I think Austin
102:31 - missed the fact maybe unless he's he's
102:34 - doing something I don't see but he
102:36 - missed the fact that I had three
102:37 - attackers on the night you need two
102:38 - protectors he brought his bishop in to
102:43 - attack the knight but you know I moved
102:46 - the knight out to attack his knight
102:47 - right away so his bishop actually
102:49 - couldn't take my knight okay good
102:55 - defense he has to he had to watch out
102:57 - for a queen takes f2 and Bishop takes b2
103:00 - he has protected both so that's really
103:03 - good I will develop a peace here in
103:12 - chess you want to constantly it's called
103:15 - development you want to focus on
103:16 - bringing your pieces into the game as
103:18 - fast as possible so you don't wanna I
103:20 - don't call pawns pieces I call pieces
103:23 - pieces so meaning when I say pieces I'm
103:26 - talking about these guys I'm not talking
103:29 - about these little tiny guys these guys
103:30 - you want to keep in the back row and try
103:33 - not to move them too much because once
103:36 - you move upon up it can never go back so
103:39 - if you move a pawn up and one of these
103:40 - squares becomes weak or you move these
103:42 - pawns up now you don't have shelter for
103:44 - your king that could be a problem okay
103:49 - Jay Austin Austin says happy birthday by
103:52 - the way he says great courses with a
103:54 - Python classes so he actually really
103:55 - likes the courses thank you so much and
103:59 - I'm glad that you're actually enjoying
104:01 - the courses I mean I personally think
104:02 - it's
104:03 - you know really useful Python course
104:07 - thank you sir
104:10 - all right now okay so he plays Bishop d3
104:14 - I like that move but I am worried he's
104:19 - making lots of moves with his Queen and
104:21 - Bishop you know he's breaking opening
104:24 - rules in the opening you should never
104:26 - move one piece twice you should try to
104:29 - move all your pieces once before you
104:31 - move any one piece twice meaning that
104:34 - you know he shouldn't play with his
104:35 - Bishop here and then bring the bishop
104:37 - back here and waste two moves on him
104:39 - instead he should just move his Bishop
104:41 - here and then move his knight out and
104:44 - instead of moving his Queen here and
104:45 - here he should have just moved his Queen
104:47 - here and one go and then moved the
104:49 - bishop out with the next move so his
104:51 - position would look a lot different if
104:53 - he didn't waste and he moves his knight
104:54 - would be here and his bishop would be
104:56 - out here but now you know he since he
105:00 - waited a little bit it's possible he
105:02 - could get into a little bit of trouble
105:08 - but I still don't have a strong attack
105:12 - or anything but I'm trying to bring my
105:14 - pieces out as fast as possible
105:19 - so I played this move not only to
105:22 - control the center but also opening up
105:24 - my bishop so my bishop can actually join
105:27 - the game he has trouble developing some
105:30 - of his pieces because of my battery here
105:37 - okay good he wants to maybe put his
105:40 - knight on c4 one day no problem mate go
105:45 - ahead and do that
105:57 - he still has trouble developing that
105:59 - bishop because my ID can go here um okay
106:03 - what if I play an annoying move like b5
106:10 - hmm just gonna play here I'm kind of
106:19 - fixing my pawn structure which is
106:21 - something I shouldn't be doing right now
106:23 - but you know I kind of like it I don't
106:28 - know kind of like controlling those dark
106:31 - squares like that
106:38 - my guy was more interested in Italy in
106:40 - playing c6 and then pushing this pawn up
106:42 - oh so when I'm saying stuff like c6 or
106:45 - d6 or Knight g4 I'm really looking at
106:48 - the coordinates so like in chess you can
106:51 - see this so there this file is called H
106:54 - file because there's a H written
106:56 - underneath it and this square every
106:59 - square has a name in chess just like
107:01 - your home everybody has a home unless
107:04 - you're homeless but if you have a home
107:06 - your home has an address and just like
107:09 - that in chess each square has an address
107:11 - so this is the H H squared because it's
107:14 - in the H file files go up and down and
107:17 - 8th ranked ranks go sideways so this
107:21 - square is H 8 you know let me ask you
107:24 - and you say it out loud if I point to it
107:26 - so what is this square called you know
107:28 - try to do this fast as you can give you
107:29 - three seconds three two one the squares
107:31 - be four right B be file and then rank is
107:36 - four so this is the squares be four how
107:39 - about this square quickly H 3 okay how
107:43 - about this square C 2 this be one so
107:45 - just like that so this rook on a one
107:47 - right now is hanging meaning it doesn't
107:49 - have any defender so I'm just gonna take
107:51 - it we got a few more challengers and
108:05 - I'll play till the challenges are here
108:08 - which is super cool you know I had some
108:09 - I'm really happy and thank you guys for
108:12 - actually playing with me
108:13 - but I really appreciate it you know it's
108:15 - something I love chess and it's awesome
108:17 - that I get to do it on my birthday and
108:19 - play with you guys like this is unreal
108:22 - this was never a possibility you know
108:24 - last year this wouldn't have been
108:25 - something that's possible I kind of
108:27 - loved how the internet works you know
108:29 - you're in some different part of the
108:30 - world and you and I are just sitting
108:32 - here and you know able to play this
108:35 - face-to-face it's it's really incredible
108:42 - so he's very sneaky he's trying to win
108:45 - the game by you know kind of tricking me
108:52 - a little bit meaning that if I just play
108:54 - like a random move here let's say I play
108:56 - my pawn up here to kick his kick his
108:58 - knight or something his idea is that he
109:00 - can take my pawn here and that would
109:04 - almost be checkmate so I don't want to
109:06 - let him do that and I will play an
109:11 - annoying move here I'm gonna play this
109:15 - move and now his problem is that if he
109:18 - takes my bishop I just take it and if he
109:21 - goes and tries to take my pawn on the
109:24 - square
109:24 - what square is this quickly if he takes
109:29 - my pawn on b7 then I can take his Bishop
109:32 - on d3 the reason why I speak we speak in
109:36 - coordinates is so we're very specific
109:38 - about what we're talking about also when
109:42 - you know when I was training it also
109:44 - allowed me to read and study from chess
109:46 - books because you know there's no person
109:48 - there so you have to read from a actual
109:50 - you know chess book I'm trying to see if
109:55 - I have some kind of killing blow here
109:58 - maybe clean edge for threatening that
110:01 - mm-hmm
110:02 - I don't think so I'm just gonna play it
110:06 - simple and trade some pieces I'm I'm up
110:09 - a rook so I can I'm up a rock in a few
110:12 - pawns so I can just choose to play here
110:14 - pretty safely here's another tip I want
110:18 - to give you guys when you're ahead in
110:20 - material try to just trade pieces you
110:23 - don't have to do anything fancy just try
110:25 - to trade pieces and get to as few pieces
110:29 - as possible because somebody who's
110:31 - losing they want to trick you right so
110:35 - the more pieces there are on the board
110:36 - they're more they're more chances there
110:39 - are of you actually getting tricked and
110:40 - losing so when you trade pieces you keep
110:44 - making the game simpler and simpler
110:46 - because they're less and less pieces and
110:47 - then there have less chances of tricking
110:50 - you so if somebody if you have two extra
110:52 - pieces but they're still they have six
110:55 - pieces and you have eight
110:56 - pieces the game can still be complicated
110:58 - but imagine if you traded all the pieces
111:00 - now they have zero pieces and you have
111:01 - two pieces now it's like no cop no
111:05 - complication at all it's actually very
111:08 - simple
111:08 - so there's a trick here his rook is
111:11 - actually unprotected so I have a trick
111:13 - here what I want to do is if this bishop
111:15 - didn't exist right imagine if this
111:17 - mission I just take it off the board it
111:18 - doesn't exist I would be able to just
111:20 - take his rook but this Bishop does exist
111:23 - so what I want to do here is move this
111:30 - Bishop which Czech sacrifice it so if
111:32 - once he takes it with his King now his
111:34 - rook is hanging so that's really his
111:38 - problem here and what I'll try to do is
111:39 - I'll try to simplify the game even more
111:41 - but by throwing in this check and this
111:46 - really simplifies the game so now he's
111:49 - forced to trade Queens and we have even
111:51 - traded Queens and as you can see we have
111:53 - very few pieces left on the board now
111:54 - but the game is getting simpler and
111:57 - simpler now I'm attacking his end Bishop
112:04 - I will play here and protect his pawn I
112:08 - have 42 seconds he has 18 seconds so he
112:11 - does need to be a little bit mindful of
112:13 - his time I'm just gonna play d4 and just
112:16 - push this pawn all the way through I
112:17 - think it's gonna be very difficult for
112:19 - him to protect and stop this idea I
112:22 - don't see any easy way to stop this idea
112:25 - for him just I mean this just pawns just
112:27 - going through so he chooses to sacrifice
112:30 - as Knight and I now as you can see
112:33 - there's so many pieces I have and he
112:36 - only has you know just a few pieces here
112:40 - let's see I'll play here now I have some
112:47 - ideas of taking that
112:55 - okay a very good game so he played
112:59 - pretty well but he you know in the end
113:01 - he got in a little bit of trouble he
113:03 - overlooked a few tactics yeah so here I
113:13 - would suggest for him instead of moving
113:15 - his bishop out maybe just focus on
113:18 - protecting this knight or just moving
113:20 - this knight out of the way you know
113:22 - instead of going Bishop here cuz
113:24 - automatically he gives me a pawn and
113:26 - then after that there are some other
113:29 - inaccuracies like giving me the full
113:30 - rook that was the biggest mistake you
113:33 - know when you see my Queen and Bishop on
113:35 - this diagonal don't push this pawn up
113:37 - and as soon as he did I just take his
113:38 - rook okay let's see if there are any
113:41 - questions for me to answer
113:43 - burning painful questions madness jack
113:49 - says he could make me cry in chess
113:51 - let's go madness Jack I'm gonna make you
113:53 - weep on livestream mmm let's go I'm
114:00 - round ready
114:03 - madness jack but you know I don't like
114:06 - crying so don't make me cry please let's
114:14 - see
114:16 - thank you thank you for wishing me happy
114:19 - birthday
114:28 - when does the next course open mullahs
114:30 - probably in five six months from now you
114:37 - know I I don't always know Sylvio Gaming
114:43 - asked your thought about the mean stack
114:45 - and he spelled it stash yeah but I know
114:49 - what you're talking about
114:51 - yeah I know I know mean stack is
114:54 - basically pretty sure it's what does the
114:57 - M I forget it sometimes but a is for
115:02 - angular and E is for something I keep
115:07 - forgetting this okay let's look it up
115:08 - mean stack yeah is for angular and it's
115:12 - for node and I forget the Ian M is for
115:21 -  yeah I think Emma's from
115:24 - yeah okay so Express yeah it's a
115:27 - very good stack to learn and to get
115:31 - familiar with but it is very complicated
115:33 - for MongoDB you need to know sequel you
115:36 - know it's not based on sequel
115:39 - programming language because it
115:40 - literally says no sequel but you do need
115:42 - to know the concepts behind sequel and
115:44 - jumping straight into MongoDB is a lot
115:46 - more difficult not definitely not as
115:50 - straightforward as just doing something
115:51 - with regular databases once you do
115:53 - something with regular databases then I
115:55 - recommend to look into MongoDB angular
115:59 - is another framework that's pretty damn
116:02 - tricky so you definitely need to be very
116:05 - comfortable with building websites from
116:07 - scratch just using HTML and CSS before
116:10 - you can really go on and take advantage
116:12 - of angular so I would I would do this a
116:16 - little bit later
116:16 - same thing with node it's a little bit
116:18 - more complicated so you want to be
116:19 - familiar with JavaScript before you
116:21 - start going all-out into node so that's
116:25 - what I would say on that question it's a
116:27 - good stack but those are the things that
116:29 - are required for it so before you do
116:32 - MongoDB learn a little bit of sequel
116:33 - before you do angularjs learn how to
116:36 - make websites from scratch using HTML
116:38 - using CSS you
116:39 - javascript go to websites like free code
116:42 - capcom you can learn from there as well
116:45 - how to build you know websites and then
116:49 - for no js' you know same thing they'll
116:51 - teach you a lot of JavaScript and then
116:52 - you can pick up node along as a way
117:16 - yeah pleather games.you so if I play I
117:18 - recently I have haven't been gaming too
117:21 - much but I do play Gears of War and I
117:23 - play some other games but yeah I am you
117:27 - know I I really like chests and I've
117:28 - been playing chests for a long time
117:30 - usually I I try not to spend my time
117:33 - gaming I try to just be very productive
117:36 - throughout the day it's very rare that I
117:39 - actually even play any games anymore my
117:42 - days look like I wake up at 4:30 a.m. in
117:44 - the morning then I'm going to lift then
117:48 - I come back a shower you know get coffee
117:52 - I'm like with what I have done usually
117:56 - by 11:00 a.m. or 12:00 p.m. is like most
117:59 - people's entire week's worth of work or
118:01 - like day's worth of work and usually
118:03 - that's done by 11:00 a.m. or 12:00 p.m.
118:05 - there's another thing I like about
118:06 - waking up in the morning and then after
118:10 - 12:00 p.m. I just get to beat everybody
118:12 - and be ahead of everybody because I have
118:14 - from 12 p.m. to 10 p.m. to do more stuff
118:17 - so then I read book you know and sneak
118:21 - in some time with a friend or to make
118:25 - content for this channel club or
118:27 - programmer make new videos or you know
118:30 - write out an email to you guys so that
118:32 - you know those are the things I'm gonna
118:34 - be I'm doing
118:43 - John Smith says co2 software on live
118:45 - please yeah definitely what I'll do is
118:47 - I've been thinking about this just do
118:49 - live stream kind of casual where you
118:51 - guys were watching over my shoulder and
118:53 - I make an app or I'm starting to work on
118:56 - something and I can show you guys how a
118:58 - framework like flask and Django and
119:00 - whatever works and how does HTML speak
119:03 - with Python code and how does that speak
119:05 - with CSS and all of that but I do need
119:07 - you guys to in the meantime you know go
119:11 - and learn the basic stuff so then when
119:14 - I'm making those more advanced videos
119:16 - you guys can follow along I don't want
119:18 - to make something that only like one
119:20 - percentage of this channel can get value
119:22 - from whereas I'm trying to focus on
119:25 - stuff that you know 99.9% of the people
119:28 - on this channel can get value from
119:30 - that's why I don't want to get too
119:32 - specific all the time with one framework
119:34 - but definitely you can expect live
119:38 - trainings like that John okay so we have
119:43 - a few more challenges I'm gonna go and
119:45 - take a look at those challenges
119:50 - Tory Maps and Mohammed I'm gonna play
119:54 - with Tory Maps accept the challenge
120:15 - okay so hi Tori ah thank you so much
120:22 - she says happy birthday or he or she um
120:26 - I don't know hopefully she'll tell me in
120:30 - the chat but it doesn't matter cuz we're
120:34 - gonna play this game of chess
120:37 - okay so Tori starts off with an
120:43 - interesting opening move g4 which
120:45 - doesn't control the center so I'm kind
120:47 - of against it but you know it could be
120:49 - pretty interesting she's moving her
120:53 - pieces to the side of the board okay
120:55 - cool
120:56 - I am going to put my bishop here you
120:59 - know sometimes your opponent's could
121:00 - have a sneaky strategy which you're not
121:04 - watching out for and you could get in a
121:07 - lot of trouble so you know I like to
121:10 - think that I know what I'm doing but you
121:12 - know maybe I would get in a lot of
121:14 - trouble so I got a focus all right maybe
121:18 - I'll take this pawn now because it
121:21 - wasn't protected this Knight is very
121:24 - scary I don't know what Tori's gonna do
121:26 - with this night so I got to keep an eye
121:27 - out on this guy cuz he can jump in here
121:32 - any time and fork my king and rook so I
121:37 - want to make sure that my queen is here
121:39 - protecting that stuff okay
121:42 - sneaky tori is trying to win this pawn
121:46 - here I'm going to move here and defend
121:49 - upon
121:54 - hmm let's see okay I am very scared of
122:16 - that night so I'm gonna have him move
122:17 - because that night is giving me like
122:21 - trauma oh my god now the other nights
122:31 - coming in jeez okay so this night is in
122:37 - trouble a little bit with my pawn could
122:40 - take it at any time so she does have to
122:44 - be a little bit careful
122:45 - and there's another sneaky little thing
122:48 - that I am threatening which she needs to
122:50 - be careful about but maybe she'll see it
122:56 - or maybe she'll miss it we will see
122:58 - okay so Tori is being really nice to me
123:02 - giving me this cute little checkmate
123:08 - she played really well and here is the
123:12 - point I would point out so this is a
123:15 - common thing that you guys can try this
123:19 - is a technique you guys can try against
123:20 - anybody bring your Bishop out here put
123:23 - your Queen here and then take care in
123:25 - checkmate so I'll show you this you can
123:27 - actually use it to checkmate people in
123:29 - four moves as little as four moves and
123:32 - it's a very good idea to actually do
123:34 - against you know maybe you're playing
123:35 - with friends or a family or anybody and
123:37 - you want to one-up them you know beat
123:38 - them quickly you can try this so I'll
123:41 - show you so for example let's just say
123:43 - White's playing some simple you know
123:45 - let's flip the board here so we can see
123:47 - it from White's perspective flip board
123:54 - so let's say that you're playing here
123:57 - you put this bishop here to look at this
123:59 - pawn so it looks like they're just
124:04 - playing natural moves to bring pieces to
124:06 - the center except look at this your
124:08 - Queens looking at this point your
124:09 - bishops looking at this pawn and there's
124:12 - only King defending it so if you take it
124:14 - that's it let's checkmate
124:16 - there's no move that black has game over
124:19 - lights out and it's it took only four
124:22 - moves so you guys can actually try this
124:24 - Bishop out Queen out and then go for a
124:27 - check like a slumber checkmate
124:30 - like Danielle wrench says okay I'm gonna
124:34 - go back um let's see
124:39 - I have never coated and at Johanna's
124:43 - Lucan says have you ever coated an
124:46 - Android app with Python
124:48 - I've never coated an Android app with
124:50 - Python but you can do it using a
124:53 - framework called Kiwi ki w-why
125:04 - okay I'm drinking monster Muhammad
125:09 - Kamran okay now I'm going to see the
125:14 - live challenges and accept a one of them
125:24 - okay last challenge it's basically Ridge
125:29 - I don't know how to say his name but
125:31 - rides to hike 180 he wants a rematch so
125:36 - we're gonna play a rematch against him
125:37 - and then uh sorry I keep saying this but
125:40 - this but I have so much fun
125:42 - sitting here and talking with you guys
125:43 - I'm playing with you guys but I really
125:45 - got to get going after this one so it's
125:47 - gonna this definitely is gonna be the
125:49 - last game and I'll try to answer some
125:51 - questions before leaving but yeah so I'm
125:55 - gonna focus here for this game now but
125:57 - this is gonna be the last challenge for
125:59 - today guys okay if I play e5 what's a
126:03 - story takes takes takes takes oh that
126:09 - doesn't work okay so I will just play
126:15 - here
126:27 - he's a very good player Oh what is he so
126:37 - very interesting line and Kings Indian I
126:41 - never really looked into this so I'm
126:46 - trying to fight for the center and
126:48 - that's why I pushed my pawn up but in
126:51 - the opening and for much of chess you
126:53 - know most of the chess is based on those
126:54 - four magical squares in the center and
126:56 - whoever wins the battle over the center
126:59 - ends up winning the game okay he just
127:03 - decides to move away
127:07 - um did I miss anything no no he's just
127:19 - giving me one free pawn here
127:22 - so I'm gonna take that pawn and I'm
127:26 - gonna keep it I'm a pawn grabber I'm
127:30 - gonna tell them you know in chess you
127:43 - want to work with small advantages and
127:45 - make them bigger and bigger and you want
127:46 - to do the same thing with you know
127:47 - software development and programming you
127:49 - like learn a few things and you keep
127:51 - using those to you know get better and
127:54 - better so in chess that's what I'm doing
127:56 - I just take one advantage and then I try
127:58 - to make it bigger and bigger before I
127:59 - just had a slight positional advantage
128:01 - and now I want a pawn and now I might
128:07 - actually win two pawns hold on what's
128:10 - the story here
128:11 - oh I have a dirty tactic here yeah this
128:18 - is not looking good for my friend Raj
128:25 - Dyke I took in a unintuitive
128:30 - way but the bishop first generally you
128:33 - know you take with the knight first and
128:34 - with the bishop and then I would hit the
128:36 - rug but here he's quite frankly just in
128:40 - a lot of trouble I'm a bunch of pawns
128:46 - now I just want to trade I want to make
128:49 - the game simpler so to make the game
128:51 - simpler all I want to do is just trade
128:53 - stuff and as long as I trade stuff like
128:58 - I win you know that's that's pretty much
129:01 - the story there so I just want to keep
129:05 - you know getting the pieces off the
129:07 - board and that's it I have a five-point
129:18 - advantage okay so he wants to take my
129:25 - queen I'll just take his queen make my
129:28 - life simpler and then I want to put my
129:32 - bishop here my bit my rook wants to come
129:36 - into game so I want to move my bishop so
129:38 - I can get my rook in the game and yeah
129:44 - now my advantage is pretty huge in this
129:45 - game it's very difficult for him because
129:47 - I have so like for this rook I have this
129:49 - stroke for that rook I have disrupt so
129:51 - that's even right except I have this one
129:53 - bishop and that gives me a pretty big
129:59 - advantage oh is he getting made it here
130:01 - yeah I think he just got made it that's
130:03 - made okay so that was checkmate he kind
130:13 - of overlooked that idea so what he needs
130:18 - to play here is king g1 and that way
130:24 - when I move my rook here it's not a
130:26 - check but he played King h2 and that's a
130:28 - big mistake because after rook here he
130:32 - moves his king out and that's checkmate
130:34 - because bishops guarding the rook
130:38 - um yeah so let's let's point out where
130:44 - he made the mistake he he dropped his
130:46 - pawn that's a mistake
130:48 - and then the next mistake was here where
130:52 - my rooks still looking at this Bishop so
130:55 - what I did is I took took took and now
130:58 - my knight and his knight and his queen
131:01 - is attacked so a lot of trouble okay
131:04 - that's it I am done with chess for now
131:07 - thank you guys so much for the challenge
131:09 - request let's see if there's a question
131:12 - waiting for me co-teacher says i'm a
131:18 - tech youtuber do you have some tips for
131:20 - me anybody that asks for business advice
131:23 - or you know youtube advice that some
131:27 - somewhere I am I don't want to say an
131:30 - expert but I definitely think I can
131:33 - offer you a lot of valuable advice there
131:36 - especially with YouTube or building your
131:39 - brand or channel or starting your
131:41 - business or startup you know things like
131:42 - that I would suggest to you that make
131:51 - helpful content consistently so if you
131:58 - are I don't know how many subscribers do
132:00 - you have tell me how many subscribers do
132:02 - you have co-teacher
132:02 - but if you have very few subscribers
132:04 - let's say you have 50 or a hundred I
132:06 - want you to focus on making content
132:11 - consistently and when I was starting out
132:13 - I was doing constant content like at one
132:16 - video a day till something sticks and
132:21 - try to tackle like popular questions or
132:24 - popular topics if you're starting out
132:29 - but be consistent with the work that
132:32 - you're putting in so don't just like do
132:33 - it two videos and then stop and then
132:35 - three videos and stop and do that's the
132:38 - worst thing you can do okay one point
132:41 - 3000 is quite a bit that's good code
132:45 - teacher tell me how many subscribers do
132:47 - you get every day and when did you start
132:49 - your channel
132:59 - there's a little bit of lag in my stream
133:02 - so I have to actually you know whatever
133:03 - I say you guys here after like 20
133:06 - seconds for something you guys are
133:13 - insane you guys have like wait gonzalo
133:16 - you have 1377 subs or are you saying how
133:18 - many subs co-teacher has okay
133:31 - so alright one year are going one year
133:35 - ago in three months so I don't know how
133:37 - many subs you get per day but I would
133:39 - assume not too many because you got one
133:42 - that 1.3 thousand and one year and three
133:45 - months so post okay yeah post
133:50 - consistently posts about popular topics
133:53 - and then the video that should cover the
133:57 - most general or the most interesting
133:59 - topic right sometimes it you even have
134:02 - to name it something that you know it's
134:05 - not scammy but it feels scamming to you
134:08 - sometimes like for example it took me a
134:11 - long time to make the video for easy
134:14 - ways to make money online like that's
134:16 - such a scam me scam me quote unquote
134:18 - title but I did have a lot of valuable
134:23 - information so if I do give it a boring
134:25 - title oh realistic title there's gonna
134:29 - be nobody that watches it but the people
134:31 - who watch it then what I did is make
134:33 - sure the quality of that content was so
134:35 - damn good and so on point and the things
134:38 - that I show you they're so tangible you
134:39 - can actually use them to make money
134:42 - especially if you're trying to be a
134:44 - programmer that so what happens is there
134:48 - are two things you make it on a topic
134:50 - that's popular so now people watch it
134:52 - not to the thing is that if it's good
134:56 - content people want to share it so now
135:01 - it's that that one person coming to you
135:03 - is really
135:04 - two people coming to you it's like
135:05 - doubling or tripling the views and based
135:08 - on who's sharing it and how big of a
135:11 - following they have then there are more
135:13 - views coming in from there and more
135:15 - shares happening there so if you tackle
135:18 - a general hot topic you definitely want
135:21 - to make make sure that that video is
135:23 - really good and not just you sitting on
135:26 - a webcam speaking especially for
135:29 - channels starting out that will really
135:30 - give you a boost
135:34 - Jana Jeon thank you for wishing me happy
135:36 - birthday I saw your message in facebook
135:38 - I really appreciate it and co-teacher
135:44 - who work on small goals right so for
135:47 - subscribers then you know your goal
135:49 - should be okay I want to now get to six
135:51 - subscribers every day or ten subscribers
135:52 - every day but if you make a video every
135:56 - day seven days a week thirty videos a
136:00 - month your subscribers should grow
136:03 - really fast and then if you want to slow
136:05 - down you can giant says hey Kazi any
136:10 - tips on how to concentrate and code for
136:12 - more time how to get rid of any
136:14 - distractions so I always like to code
136:19 - outside of my house because with your
136:22 - house you associate I don't know going
136:25 - to the bathroom reading a book watching
136:28 - Game of Thrones sitting watching Netflix
136:31 - playing a game playing guitar playing
136:34 - chess hanging out with friends
136:36 - sleeping there's so many things
136:38 - associated with your mind that I don't
136:40 - like to be at home and I'm working so my
136:43 - home for a while was Panera Bread and
136:45 - Starbucks and now it's my office so if
136:49 - you can afford it get an office you can
136:52 - get it for like you can get pretty good
136:53 - places for seven eight hundred bucks a
136:55 - month but if that's too expensive then
137:00 - you know just go to Starbucks or go to
137:04 - Panera Bread or go go to some local
137:08 - place that has a calm vibe that you like
137:11 - and then you can associate getting
137:12 - coffee and working there so then every
137:14 - time you go there you kind of go in your
137:17 - zone
137:18 - and then also listening to music but
137:24 - very specific kind of music music
137:26 - distracts me a lot and whenever I listen
137:28 - to music I start like listening to the
137:30 - lyrics and I'm just like singing along
137:31 - with them so listen I like to listen to
137:35 - like I go on Spotify I go in genres I
137:39 - click on moods and then I go to the
137:41 - playlist called focus or like brain food
137:44 - and those are playlists that play songs
137:48 - that don't have words is just very calm
137:51 - relaxing background music that's not
137:54 - annoying at all so that should help you
138:08 - yeah your co-teacher listen your HTML
138:11 - series you can't say four easy ways to
138:14 - make money and then teach HTML that
138:15 - doesn't make sense so don't make it it
138:19 - doesn't have to be click baby or
138:20 - anything HTML itself is popular you just
138:24 - have to make sure you have 1520 videos
138:26 - on it and they're good quality content
138:30 - that's what happened with my Python
138:33 - programming course it was like it had no
138:35 - views for a while and then I had you
138:38 - know when I had for two videos or three
138:40 - videos or four videos but then when I
138:42 - got like 15 or 20 videos like people are
138:45 - going through and they're like holy
138:46 - this is good send a link to their friend
138:48 - or share it or something and then more
138:50 - people come in and then YouTube start
138:52 - seeing wow these people are spending a
138:54 - lot of time on this one programming
138:57 - Python playlist so then you to start
138:59 - suggesting this playlist to everybody
139:02 - else cuz now YouTube's algorithm doesn't
139:04 - favor how much percentage of your video
139:07 - is watched but rather how many minutes
139:09 - of your videos watched so don't shoot
139:12 - for making short videos because it
139:14 - doesn't matter if you make a 1 minute
139:15 - video that has a hundred percent watch
139:17 - time because if you because what's
139:19 - better is if you have a 1 hour long
139:20 - video that has a two minute watch time
139:22 - on average that one is actually better
139:24 - even though the first one has a higher
139:25 - completion rate because it was so short
139:28 - YouTube doesn't care they want people to
139:30 - spend more time on your channel so the
139:33 - one hour long video that gets watched
139:35 - for only two minutes for whatever reason
139:37 - actually gets suggested more often so
139:42 - when you have a playlist and you have
139:43 - people spending more time in that
139:44 - playlist your channel and your playlist
139:47 - and your videos are being recommended to
139:49 - more and more and more people so yeah
139:52 - and this is another thing that I want to
139:54 - talk about you know guys this this idea
139:58 - of consuming versus creating focus on
140:01 - creating content don't get in the habit
140:03 - of consuming content so meaning even if
140:06 - you suck in programming and you are like
140:09 - you have the worst skills ever and
140:12 - you're slow type or whatever make a
140:14 - video about what you're struggling with
140:16 - you the video could literally be about I
140:19 - don't get this thing
140:21 - you could talk for a few minutes and
140:23 - talk about that and then in the comments
140:25 - people could help you or they could
140:27 - identify with you going through the same
140:29 - struggles you could literally just
140:31 - document your own journey you don't even
140:33 - have to create anything new and later it
140:38 - could serve as you know first of all
140:41 - obviously you can get money from YouTube
140:44 - okay cool
140:45 - another thing that's really amazing I
140:48 - think is that you have this thing you
140:51 - can always go back and refer to so if
140:53 - you're covering some topics in a video
140:55 - it's there for you it only makes your
140:58 - understanding better when you're trying
140:59 - to teach it and three like some of my
141:04 - friends have gotten jobs because of
141:05 - their YouTube channel so it's possible
141:08 - that if you're even talking about
141:10 - software development and coding you can
141:12 - get an injunction or something cuz
141:14 - people be like wow this person is very
141:16 - dedicated so you know a lot of the times
141:19 - I hear people go it's so risky I don't
141:21 - want to start a channel what if it fails
141:23 - or I don't want to start a business you
141:27 - could be like 40 years old and have a
141:29 - business or a channel or you could be 40
141:31 - years old and have no business and no
141:32 - channel like those are the two options
141:34 - the one I like is being 40 and having
141:38 - you know the channel and a business
141:42 - because very often I mean what are you
141:45 - gonna substitute that time with most of
141:46 - the times will substitute that time with
141:48 - watching house of cards so instead of
141:50 - spending your time watching a TV show
141:53 - you can build a business so the only
141:56 - risk is you don't get to watch as much
141:59 - house of cards or Game of Thrones you
142:01 - know so it's not really a risk and I
142:04 - suggest getting in the habit of creating
142:06 - content whether you want to write you're
142:07 - scared shitless of being on camera
142:10 - then you know just focus maybe on
142:12 - writing or overcome your fear of being
142:16 - in front of the camera and if you're not
142:18 - that afraid of being in front of the
142:19 - camera then you know make a video
142:21 - because I think it's so easy to create
142:23 - video versus sitting and writing but
142:27 - yeah I went on a little bit of tangent
142:29 - there but that's just a little bit of my
142:31 - philosophy and hopefully should be
142:32 - applicable outside of just YouTube
143:00 - yeah co-teacher good luck best of luck
143:03 - to you keep me updated on how your
143:05 - channel is doing but just make sure that
143:08 - when you make the content make it damn
143:11 - good you know don't make it a PowerPoint
143:13 - hiding behind camera I like put some
143:15 - life into it make it interesting watch
143:18 - like okay let's say you want to make
143:21 - HTML series goal type in HTML course or
143:26 - something HTML on YouTube and the most
143:28 - popular one that comes up watch them and
143:31 - see how what are the things that they're
143:33 - doing what are their energy levels when
143:35 - they're speaking do they have a camera
143:37 - are they recording themselves in the
143:39 - video like what is it they're doing and
143:41 - then don't steal what they're doing but
143:42 - model what they're doing right so make
143:45 - your videos like them don't just like
143:47 - steal their content you can still make
143:50 - your own course your own curriculum but
143:52 - see a lot of what's working and then try
143:55 - to make it like that you know don't have
143:57 - one of those annoying tutorials where
143:58 - it's like some guy has the notepad on
144:01 - the screen and instead of just speaking
144:02 - to you he's like typing stuff on the
144:04 - notepad and then it's like you just have
144:08 - to read like what he's talking about I
144:11 - find those so annoying and those
144:13 - channels are always suffering so just
144:16 - try to make good normal quality content
144:19 - okay what is
144:31 - soo-ji said sujeet says how do free apps
144:42 - one will fall I did do private chest
144:45 - lessons I might still do them email me
144:48 - about it but I'm getting very like
144:53 - one-on-one time I'm getting very crazy
144:56 - with my time I'm trying not to do too
144:58 - much one-on-one with anybody cuz I want
145:01 - to focus on making content that helps
145:03 - the whole world so that's why one-on-one
145:07 - is getting tougher and tougher for me as
145:09 - time progresses and I'm actually really
145:10 - trying to step away from it to be honest
145:14 - but yeah I did used to do private chess
145:17 - lessons okay so Sajid says how do free
145:21 - apps like whatsapp makes money so free
145:24 - apps make money by holding the attention
145:27 - of the audience once you build the
145:29 - audience they're unlimited amount of
145:31 - ways of making money you can sell them
145:33 - anything the number one thing is just
145:35 - having an audience and having people
145:37 - there this is very important to
145:39 - understand meaning even if your want to
145:42 - be a programmer you want to create an
145:43 - app most people think oh I'll just
145:44 - create a super awesome app and everybody
145:46 - will get it that's unfortunately not
145:49 - what will happen here's what will happen
145:51 - you will work you will work really hard
145:54 - you will spend years of your time you
145:56 - will spend money resources you will take
145:59 - risks you will put your family at risk
146:00 - by maybe reducing your job or quitting
146:04 - your job and taking that big initiative
146:06 - big jump maybe starting your own
146:07 - business to make that app because you
146:09 - believe in it so much and then when you
146:12 - launch it and it's out there in the
146:14 - market which you'll hear is cricket's
146:17 - nobody gets it and the reason is not
146:21 - because your app is not good or blah
146:22 - blah blah the reason is you don't have
146:25 - an audience so if you don't have anybody
146:27 - to get it what the hell is the point of
146:30 - your material or course that was one of
146:32 - the biggest realizations I had when I
146:34 - was working on some of my courses cuz
146:35 - I've always loved teaching and I built
146:39 - my chest a stick business which you know
146:40 - I I say it's fail
146:42 - old but really I just stopped working on
146:45 - it but it's called chest tastic comm and
146:47 - it's still online but I don't really do
146:49 - anything with it too much
146:51 - but you know what I lost my train of
146:55 - thought or somebody could remind me in
146:56 - the chat but Jesus I just had a train
146:59 - wreck oh yeah I remember now so make
147:10 - sure that you have an audience before
147:12 - you so basically my chest tastic channel
147:14 - I made these amazing phenomenal chess
147:17 - courses and then I was like okay I'll
147:20 - just sell them great and nobody ever
147:22 - bottom nobody took me up on my offer
147:25 - and it was like months of time I spent
147:28 - months on like designing the logo
147:30 - spending money on the logo you have to
147:31 - understand I was 17 or 18 years old even
147:34 - younger maybe 16 years old when I was
147:36 - building that company and I had no like
147:39 - real money you know as like a little bit
147:41 - of money but it wasn't a lot of money
147:42 - and I'm going to college I'm doing jobs
147:45 - so to invest my time there you know I
147:49 - wouldn't say risky but took a lot of
147:52 - effort and so that was the biggest
147:55 - problem you know there's no audience so
147:57 - even if you're building sass which is
147:59 - which it stands for SaaS you know
148:03 - software as-a-service something like
148:06 - Spotify that's a sass write software as
148:09 - a service it's all automated and it's a
148:11 - software but it's like a service you
148:14 - just pay for it monthly and you get it
148:15 - you know if you want to build things
148:17 - like that or you know there's so many
148:21 - things I just can't come up with
148:22 - examples right now even to sell that you
148:25 - need an audience beforehand
148:27 - so it's important to understand how to
148:30 - build audience and then you can you know
148:34 - then when you build an app you which
148:36 - don't want to do is build an entire app
148:38 - and then try to sell it to them you want
148:40 - to build like a very small lightweight
148:44 - version of it that maybe takes you 2 to
148:46 - 3 weeks of your time and then put it out
148:49 - there and then people are using it and
148:51 - enjoying it then you can keep adding in
148:53 - new versions the great thing is you
148:55 - already have two
148:56 - instead we're ready to you know
148:58 - basically like you basically have to
149:00 - confirm with them that they'll buy your
149:03 - app before you ever make it and that
149:06 - reduces your risk reduces any chances of
149:09 - failure and that's something I could
149:11 - really help you I know that's super you
149:14 - know it's a tangent and it's something
149:15 - that you guys can't see yourself there
149:16 - yet but it's one of those you want to
149:18 - wrap it away in your head and once you
149:20 - get good at programming or a specific
149:21 - thing you know you could really use this
149:24 - to kickstart your own business
149:30 - gonzalo thank you so much take care have
149:32 - a good one my friend
149:34 - yeah co-teacher it's it's not for
149:37 - earning money but just to cover the cost
149:38 - of YouTube yeah camera setup I
149:40 - understand when I started my channel I
149:42 - just like went crazy bought a $5,000
149:44 - iMac like basically had to take loans to
149:47 - do that bottle I it's bought camera
149:49 - bought so many things and I had to take
149:51 - loans to do that because I didn't have
149:53 - money when I was starting out our very
149:55 - little money and and yeah like I was I
150:00 - mean was just my passion I wanted to get
150:03 - this message heard and across I didn't
150:05 - even care at that time about money or
150:07 - anything I just wanted just to be heard
150:09 - and so I just did it with whatever I had
150:11 - and with whatever I could I just
150:13 - believed in making quality content so
150:15 - that's really why I invested so much you
150:17 - don't need to invest that like I
150:20 - honestly think is stupid if I were to do
150:22 - it now I'll just do it with regular
150:24 - camera and stuff but it was enjoyable to
150:29 - me and I enjoyed it so you know if it's
150:32 - something that you enjoyed then go
150:34 - through with it and do it Ryan that is
150:41 - great to hear my friend that's good
150:44 - glad you're loving the courses and
150:46 - you're redoing them and you're grinding
150:48 - every day for several hours a day just
150:50 - really the only ways to do it you know
150:52 - it's not this field is there's no quick
150:55 - like you know a few days and you'll get
150:58 - success or you'll start making money
151:00 - you'll start landing clients or get a
151:01 - job it does take time it does take a lot
151:05 - of consistent effort redoing things prac
151:09 - saying but then once you start getting
151:12 - their rewards
151:13 - they are pretty unlike any other field
151:16 - and the amount of options you have right
151:17 - but you have to enjoy the journey of
151:21 - programming you have to learn to enjoy
151:23 - it so then even when it gets really hard
151:26 - it's not you're not doing it because you
151:28 - should want to put your nose to the
151:30 - grindstone it's because you're actually
151:31 - enjoying it and you know that will allow
151:36 - you to get past the hard parts all day
151:38 - without a problem
151:55 - Jona you said that this course has done
151:58 - nothing for you and you've been in
152:01 - programming for three years do you have
152:03 - a programming job right now yes I mean
152:13 - if you do the code Academy course on
152:15 - Python of course you'll learn a lot of
152:16 - things mmm dingo yes I will teach you
152:23 - guys how to connect Python to different
152:25 - frameworks Ryan good job
152:29 - yes exactly if you're in Silicon Valley
152:32 - take advantage of the resources around
152:34 - there and network with people people is
152:37 - like the number one thing you guys can
152:39 - do so you know courses and everything is
152:43 - always gonna be awesome
152:44 - but getting to work with people who are
152:47 - maybe even at a similar level or a
152:48 - little bit ahead of you who can show you
152:50 - the way that's gonna be amazing and if
152:53 - you can connect with them in real life
152:54 - it doesn't cost you anything
152:55 - and it's the best way to get going like
152:59 - I was I started coding when one of my
153:01 - best friends and we just did it like for
153:03 - 17 hours a day and it was incredibly fun
153:05 - because we both were just in it you know
153:08 - and we both were doing it so if I was
153:10 - struggling I saw him struggling and it
153:11 - just kept me going ah Jordan to come up
153:18 - with ideas first think about replicating
153:21 - things that exist and then you'll get
153:23 - better at coming up with the ideas
153:24 - because there are two problems coming up
153:25 - with an idea one is obviously coming up
153:28 - with the idea too it's executing the
153:30 - idea that you come up with even if you
153:32 - come up with an idea how do you know
153:34 - that you have the skill to execute it
153:36 - you know is it gonna be like two months
153:38 - long journey and at the end you find out
153:40 - you couldn't execute it and you didn't
153:41 - know the tools so that's why work on
153:45 - making stuff that already exists and try
153:47 - to clone it and then you can actually
153:50 - move on so like go online and type in
153:53 - like Python app tutorial or there's an
153:56 - app I show you guys how to make it I
153:57 - have a youtube tutorial on it
153:59 - it's a texting app so you can actually
154:02 - type in text app Python clever program
154:04 - or something like that my video should
154:05 - come up and in that video I
154:08 - show you how to make an app so basically
154:09 - in the start you want to just follow
154:10 - along and go on and you know just do
154:14 - exactly what's happening and then go on
154:16 - little tangents to like what if I do
154:19 - this instead what if I do this instead
154:21 - while you're following this tutorial and
154:23 - once you build a few apps you'll start
154:25 - to get an idea of how do you make them
154:27 - what kind of ideas should I make them
154:29 - about and then later you can also know
154:33 - whether you have the skill set to make
154:35 - something or not okay but first don't
154:37 - just start off but I want to just create
154:39 - something out of the blue first Jordan
154:41 - focus on making something that already
154:44 - exists you know maybe you can start off
154:48 - with a Pomodoro timer you know people go
154:51 - on your app and they click it and the
154:52 - timer source for five minutes and then
154:54 - it makes a little noise or does
154:55 - something you know something simple and
154:57 - then go from there okay guys I'm gonna
155:04 - get going I'm gonna take maybe one
155:06 - question or something
155:10 - Sahil I'm planning he says I'm planning
155:12 - to learn see after completing the book
155:14 - learning Python the hard way okay sure
155:16 - enjoy have fun I never understand why
155:18 - okay so I wanted to do this as well for
155:21 - the longest time just do language
155:23 - hopping and you know now I can save you
155:27 - a lot of time and just tell you like if
155:29 - you want excel in the field language
155:32 - hopping isn't gonna get you there the
155:33 - fastest way it doesn't hurt you it does
155:36 - make you more knowledgeable but it
155:38 - doesn't get you to where you want to go
155:40 - in the fastest way specializing does and
155:43 - then after specializing you can become
155:45 - more of a generalist if you want to so
155:47 - if you have learned Python I would say
155:49 - stick with Python but if you learned si
155:52 - and you're good with Si then I would say
155:53 - just stick with si and keep going
155:55 - instead of learning like 10 different
155:57 - languages and becoming proficient at
155:59 - them because it's not about the language
156:01 - is about what you can do with the
156:03 - languages it's like you learn English
156:06 - and now you're ready to get a job in
156:08 - America and you're just like screw this
156:09 -  I'm gonna go to Germany and then
156:11 - you just like go learn German and then
156:13 - you leave that country and go somewhere
156:14 - else so when you're learning a language
156:17 - just understand that there's a reason
156:19 - behind it then follow through with that
156:21 - and don't just get lost and bounce back
156:23 - and forth
156:39 - I use having a victim mentality and a
156:45 - whiny attitude will not get you far my
156:48 - friend so if I don't answer your
156:51 - question that definitely will not make
156:53 - me answer it you know like one of the
156:59 - things about successful people is you
157:01 - don't want to blame things on something
157:05 - other than yourself you know grant
157:06 - cardone says this and I believe this in
157:08 - and well as well nothing happens to you
157:11 - it happens because of you okay so take
157:16 - matters into your own hands and the more
157:18 - you blame external things the less
157:20 - control you'll have over your life
157:23 - itself okay so yes okay guys thank you
157:32 - guys so much for coming I really
157:34 - appreciate it and I'm gonna get going
157:38 - and enjoy the rest of my day honestly
157:46 - yeah thank you guys so much for coming I
157:47 - appreciate it so much it was awesome we
157:50 - got to play some chess I might do this
157:51 - again hopefully I try to provide you
157:54 - guys with some value but does that is it
157:57 - guys thank you guys so much as always I
157:59 - love your face off and I'll see you in
158:04 - the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer comm we're going live today so it's my birthday today and I thought hey what more exciting way to celebrate it and to start off my day then spend some time with you guys and also do something that I love a lot which is play chess so today is gonna be not so serious day and check it out I'm wearing the all right this way clever programmer shirt but yeah so today it's not gonna be such a serious day we're just gonna be having fun so before this video even starts if you're here for programming there's not gonna be too much programming I'm just gonna be hanging out and also I'll answer some questions for fun so you know any any question you want to ask me could be anything or if you want to keep you know ask me some technical program in question I'll answer that as well but other than that I'll play some chess and teach you some chests and you can just watch it over my shoulder and see my crazy reactions as I'm playing and my thought process and maybe pick up secret or two that you can use as well yep so we'll see how it goes okay let's see if there are people here so far hi oh nice there are other people whose birthday happy birthday George thank you guys thank you I appreciate it thank you thank you thank you doctor says it was his birthday yesterday happy birthday doc you guys are way too nice way too nice alright so I'm gonna start playing and just watch along and let me know how you guys like it okay cool so let's see hopefully I have my stuff set up right um you do this I think that should be good we'll doublecheck in a little bit but um I'm gonna play like a three minute game and I'll try to talk my way through it hopefully and we'll see how I do I'm probably gonna lose cuz it takes a lot of attention to play a quick game but let's see so my rating is almost 2000 which puts me around the top 1% in chess but when you play online they put you against people of your own ratings and chests the goal is to get this guy the king if you guys don't know so that's really what I'm gonna be focusing on and I have a little bit of experience playing chess okay so I want to put my rook here so I can attack his King and he blocks it which is a good move and I'll move back cuz he was gonna take my bishop okay I will do this so now I'm gonna take his knight if he doesn't do anything so he does do something let's see why can't I just win a pawn here so I'm thinking I can take the knight he takes back with the rook I take what the rook he takes with the Queen and then I take here because now the Queen isn't guarding the pawn anymore so I'm oh wait maybe I can just take here right now takes Bishop to Bishop tags I'm actually let's do it this way okay so now I have an extra pawn he's probably gonna play here and I have to see what I can do you know with that pawn and try to win off of that pawn he's playing a little bit aggressively but I'm gonna like strike back I don't want him to put the pond in front of my face okay let's see okay I'm gonna go here open that up a little bit and then play here so now I'm attacking that pawn and also I can put my bishop or I'm an attack his rook and now what about Knight g5 doesn't that yeah that move is really annoying cuz I'm attacking this guy there's no good way for him to defend it except move his rook here to protect that pawn because I have one two attackers on this guy and he has one two defenders but he doesn't want to give up his queen to defend I'm also preparing for a tournament that's coming up this weekend it's gonna be a pretty tough tournament it's called Chicago class so I'm gonna be playing there Knight takes rook takes Queen a4 no I don't like that actually I just feel like I have a lot of pressure on his position here and now oh did I just drop this pawn oh I'm an idiot oh oh wait is there a knight takes f7 no ship takes rook yeah I kind of messed this one up guys okay well it is what it is dropped a pawn here Oh what if I take his Bishop and then play rook here oh he attacks my knight and then I move here keeping threat on his rope night and then bishop and also fork yeah so it looks like I should be okay here with after Knight here yeah I think so well he has rook here dang this lucky guy huh it's very close oh I have Knight here there's crazy stuff going on all over the place okay so now he wants to play a rook here to attack my knight and then if I move my knight he wants to play rook here I even tried to checkmate me but that's not gonna be happening right now because I have a lot of pressure on this pawn and he can't move this pawn this bishop is attacking it rook and Knight I have 37 seconds he has one minute 28 seconds he can win on time so if I go 20 minutes 0 seconds he wins and after this round is over I'll take a break and then I'll come back and I'll answer some of your guys's burning questions why did he do that I just went his bishop okay so now it's yeah he resigned here because I have so Bishop is worth three points rook is five points and pawns are one point so basically if you add all of this up I'm ahead by a eight points and you know I'm gonna basically take his pawns then move this pawn up and get a queen and then I would use this this piece and my new queen to then checkmate the King he doesn't want to play that and he resigned okay so I'm gonna switch over and try to answer some of your guys's questions now hopefully you guys saw that fine ooh lots of happy birthday's coming through nice thank you guys thank you thank you thank you yeah Katie you you should come here you guys are welcome to come here and celebrate my birthday with me if you guys are in United States I would love to catch up with you guys and just hang out yeah I should really be coding today but I decided to take a day off from coding I'm trying I'm playing some chess recently so you know kind of felt like doing that for a little bit but okay guys go ahead if you guys have questions I'll ask them now before I start my next chess game and then I won't be able to answer them and I'm playing the game because I can't see your questions alright let's see okay good oh we have lots of people live that's actually really cool we got a bunch of you guys online ask me your questions ask me your questions I'll answer them you guys are way too nice yeah well okay so subscribers are going up which is great the channel really was add you know zero subscribers and are very few subscribers until September last year and one of my goals by December was to get 100 subscribers but instead of getting 100 subscribers by December I ended up getting 5,000 subscribers by December which was phenomenal and yeah according to my calculations back in the day 60,000 subscribers should have taken like three or four years but that ended up happening a lot quicker than that meaning it ended up happening in July which is again fantastic thank you guys so much for supporting the channel if you haven't subscribed please do subscribe but I have a feeling that you must have subscribed because you got the notification for the livestream and I'm from like right now did you just get a notification from YouTube or did you get an email from me and that's what brought you here oh wow Katie knows chess openings nice well let's see okay so mukha says feed aerating my feed eeeh trading is probably around 1900 1800 my USCF rating is about 2002 it was 2000 66 in peak time but then I stopped playing chess I focused more in software development I focused more on making pointing getting clients and my chess rating dropped and so now that I have more time I mean I'm trying to play chess again because I just loved it um yeah my favorite chess opening is Joko piano I love it I understand it really well it's spelled really weirdly and most of you guys won't know what the heck I'm talking about but it's probably one of the most basic openings you ever learn in chess and I love it and I play it to this day and I can maybe maybe show it to you really quickly so here's how Joko piano looks I want to close the chess engine so basically I bring my night out so one of the things that you guys should know if you're playing chess so these are some top secrets is that don't move your pawns a lot and every move you make should control one of these four squares just this secret alone will help you beat almost like anybody that you play against I don't mean competitive players but like if you're playing as your dad your brother your friend you know your cousin and you've been getting beat by them all the time just a secret alone will help you a lot so in the opening only make moves that control the center so okay here's a opening move I bring my knight out and it controls two Center squares because Knight can attack like this and this and then black brings his Knight out and then I play Bishop c4 which again you know controlling these four squares and oh yeah this is joke Oh piano you know I don't want to go any deeper than this because they're like 10 more moves down the line and all kinds of different variations and stuff but to keep it very simple this is what it looks like you know and these are moves that when you start out in chess these are some of the moves that you know get taught by your coach or really anybody who knows how to play chess a little bit they can show you but basically you know whites controlling the center really well blacks controlling the center really well and then you play on from here so I really love this opening and then I also like the Grand Prix against the Sicilian but you know I don't want to step into the esoteric category too much and I still want to keep you guys with me so let me switch again all right here we go so hopefully I kind of answered that question if SIL says hey Kazi your videos are awesome I need career advice regarding software web development such as technologies to go for and then what is the industry standard again you know it's not about how many technologies it's about really picking one and getting good at it and getting people results with it so you don't have to worry about too many different technology but you know focus on becoming good at one technology or language so for example I always talk about programming and let's say you're good at Java focus on becoming better at Java and then you'll be able to you know like get your foot in the door so you can start working with the company maybe as a junior developer or maybe as an intern and then you can all still teach you some other stacks meaning for example if they need you to do some web development they'll teach you sequel or they'll teach you I don't know HTML or CSS you know things like that and then you'll end up picking it up so get good at one thing and then you can add more things on top of that and you know another simple stack is Python Python HTML CSS may be a little bit of JavaScript but once you get good at one thing it's easy to pick up these other languages all right let's see okay ah let's see what are the questions I'm trying to yeah let's see Zara's says happy birthday thank you Sara and she says enjoy your date how do you stay active and physically fit while programming full time so if you just go with the natural momentum of things like just natural flow and go by how you feel like every day you will be in very bad shape which is where like most of the programmers get a bad rep and rightfully so most of them are like fat or don't take care of themselves or smell like crap and it's not it's kind of their fault but it's also not so much their fault because it's the field and the field itself it just kind of like you sit and you're creating awesome stuff but you're sitting most of the time you know and and you're not really moving around so you really have to make it a part of your day to go and put in some physical work and a lot of the times when you think of work you don't want to do it so how I like to make myself work is I like soccer so I'll join an intraoral intramural soccer team which is it's not competitive but it's a soccer team and so by playing a soccer game and being there for my team it's fun there's a lot of fun and it pretty much forces me to keep myself physically fit or I'll play tennis with my friends Reese you know I also lift but you know if lifting is difficult for you try one of these other strategies because you want it to be fun too to work out and then it'll become a habit after that so if it's just work you're not gonna do it you're gonna do it for a week and then you're gonna quit and now I'm doing like martial arts I'm doing jujitsu I'm doing boxing and those things give more purpose to you know just me improving my strength because strength like sure I can you know pick up more groceries and and obviously feel really fit strength is my favorite thing because I don't have to run but you know then adding in some fighting or like mixed martial arts gives it more of a purpose so you know create systems that force you to be there and force you to work just like when I started the clever programmer channel I was working with lots of clients around that time and I was going to college I had like multiple different jobs so I was putting it I mean I was working like 16 hours a day working or studying and then what I did was I gave up all my clients and I cut all my sources of income and and then I also got this office and that was an additional overhead expense and what that forced me to do was like that was great that I had motivation to keep this channel going but I made it so I literally had to survive off of this channel and live off of this channel and really turn it into a business and that was the best decision I've ever made because motivation keeps you going but then it can run out you know it's like willpower it can run out but then if it's necessity that doesn't run out because otherwise you just can't live you know you can't keep up your standard of lifestyle and the pain there is too much so may I make these systems for myself and you can do the same thing hopefully that answers your questions our jimothy that's an interesting name I've never heard jimothy of her Timothy and Jimmy but not jimothy so now in my new programming videos maybe you'll be hearing a lot of jimothy because I'm sick of Bob and banana those are the only two thin damn things that come to my mind and you you probably see that in all my tutorials but yeah jimothy films it's a great epic name he asks can you do C++ series like you did the Python series not right now I'm pretty focused on Python and the stack that goes behind Python so I'm gonna be really doing that not not too much C++ or anything right now aha let's see what are those numbers 80 77 78 I have no idea what numbers use it yeah it's always tough because you know um I will yeah I can start a blog on web development and all of that but the one thing that's tough is a lot of you guys are just starting out so most of the things aren't gonna make too much sense and I don't want to do stuff that you know just like you know just you just go and figure it out I'll just post random stuff so I'm really trying to cater and make stuff that everybody can understand and follow along and then you know we move and then you know more I'll add in more advanced stuff but there's a lot of missing pieces right now that I think are vital and are just not taught by so many other channels and programs so I want to make sure that I fill in those gaps for you guys vivix vivix says hey Kazi happy birthday I want to learn to develop iOS apps I'm reading a book by Apple on iBooks is it good question mark what do you recommend and I want to implement AI for an app idea um a book by Apple I don't know that sounds like a really technical jargon eBook that doesn't really teach how to create stuff but just kind of shows you some tutorials or something I haven't seen that book but I would recommend like you know just go on Amazon and look up some iOS book I personally don't have too much experience developing in iOS but I am familiar with the language that you use it's called Swift and if you want to develop AI stuff one of the best channels to follow a Siraj Raval it's s ir aj space are IV al somebody write that in chat please so people can see what channel I'm talking about and it's a channel on YouTube and this guy is phenomenal and he goes over a lot of machine learning concepts though they are advanced and if you don't know programming it wouldn't really make that much sense like you'll just be copying and pasting stuff which if you're ok with it then go definitely try it out but you know I would say go check them out and you learn a lot of like he'll show you how you can create a game of ping pong where the computer beat you know learns by losing and then gets better and better and like basically teach it teaches itself so that's AI and you can then you know use your iOS book and then learn what you learn from Sir Roger of all even though he teaches in Python but language doesn't matter concepts do and you can take what you learn from Suraj traval and then apply it to your iOS app by learning those applying those same concepts and Swift okay so yeah hmm ah nice Bassam console dot write line happy birthday nice one I love it Josie jo jo's Oh Ramos I'm butchering your name I'm sorry it's Jo su e space Ramos I says happy birthday I want to learn programming but I type too slow due to only being able to use one hand do you think this could be an impediment to learn it's actually really funny you say that not the funny part the funny part is not that you have one hand but the funny part that you type to slope because I am making I made a video about typing and how that it can actually help you learn much faster and get better results and why it's so important that video is gonna come out probably in a week or two but here's what I will say I don't think it's an impediment to do coding that's one great thing about coding that even if you don't have an arm you could still be a fantastic coder and code well because it's really about thoughts there isn't much typing mmm it's not like writing you know like for example a good code or can write something in two lines which you know an amateur might write in 20 or 50 lines so that just goes to show there's a lot of thought process that takes place and creativity that takes place when I'm coding on a project or doing a problem 90% plus of my time is spent thinking so it's either I'm sitting here thinking like this or I'm going out for a walk and I just close my eyes and I'm thinking of possible solutions and you know different ideas that I could come up with and that I could implement so when I come to write the code after like two hours of thinking I might write three lines of code so you know there isn't a lot crazy amount of typing now of course it's going to be an impediment but I also watch this video that you should look at I forgot what it was called but basically this guy is writing code in Emacs which is a writing editor and he's writing it he's using dictation and this guy has developed some insane system to write code by just speaking and he he's paralyzed I don't even think and any of his hands work and he's literally just and he does alive on in a live event he shows how he's writing code and so he's saying some crazy stuff like LARP sharp chook and his code is being refactored their arguments that are being added in the parenthesis they're squigglies getting added their semicolons being added in the right place the code is getting indented correctly and I'm sitting there like holy even with two arms and a typing speed of 100 words per minute which is about my typing speed I cannot write how quickly he just wrote that so there are better systems there you know it's only as much of an impediment as you let it be their workarounds and I suggest you look into those workarounds and yeah that's that mmhmm house I actually thought about making computer programming tutorials in or do or Hindi but maybe on our another channel clever or do.com or something tips and tricks thank you for wishing me happy birthday and yes I am replying to you as well let's see Manish I don't know what time will I tell up will I be online I'm just doing this for fun so if I feel like staying here for a little bit longer I'll stay here if I feel like leaving I'll leave but you know I'm having fun here answering your guys's questions so you know I'm probably gonna be here for a little while longer but you know not the whole day or anything like that thank you so me uh Thank You Luca tax Thank You fourth planet yep programming is thinking and not that much typing 100 percent agreed let's see any more questions questions questions cocka cocka questions let's see yeah I'm gonna do I'm gonna do like life coding for you guys doing live streams we just had a launch and the launch was absolutely insane it was basically the create Python Opie course and you know usually I'll open it up only for a five day period and then I announce it and then it's like everybody goes crazy and you know including everybody a clever programmer and team and all the students and so we got hundreds of new students that joined this time and then the program shut down so now things are calming down a little bit and I was thinking to do some live stream for you guys where I'm coding and you guys just kind of get to watch over my shoulder and see my thought process and everything yeah I just completed all your Python courses do you think it's time to move on to another programming language like JavaScript PS I'm passionate about web development Yussef this is exactly the time my friend where you as garyvee would say you grab Python by the throat this is exactly the time where you use Python and create actual things so now that you are trained I want you to create stuff and you can do web development with Python look into a framework called flask don't start with Django it's too little too complicated and magical especially when you're starting out look into flask and then with flask HTML CSS you'll you can build pretty much anything so you you know full web development stuff and flask is you know not some esoteric framework it's just as popular you know you have Python web developers using flask making hundred over a hundred thousand dollars or averaging around ninety thousand dollars Python has backend of backend developers full stack developers frontend developers you know using Python so it's hot and it's trending it's not a risky thing to learn and invest your time in not now and not you know for the next 10 20 years well let's just say five years because things change quickly in the programming world however once you know the concepts you can quickly switch over and print happy birthday let's see what else okay let me answer some more stuff for you guys guys have some juicy questions um okay yeah sure well I can provide some automation Python tutorials thank you Kishore hey bro I'm learning Python but my math is not good so please tell in programming need math Satya asks and basically what he's trying to ask is do you need math in programming and my answer to this question is math helps but you don't need it not at all absolutely not there are too many programmers I know that our terrible math I'm pretty bad at math I can think logically but I'm not very good at math so yeah you don't you don't really need that much math you can be really good in programming it's it's it's like I say it's language almost as a reallife language so you know for learning French or German or doing something creative or learning how to write a bike or learning how to swim you just need to learn that thing and it's not really associated with a bunch of other things it's it's kind of asking do I need to be good at math to swim you don't need to be good at math to swim chase asked when does your program go up chase my program goes up probably in four five five months again maybe longer I'm not sure but what I do is I close the program down and improve it and then I launch it again how old am i well let's just say that 23 sounds way better than 22 thank you gun going Kahlo all of us I've just butchered your name but thank you so much I didn't delete my recent live feeds I just private at them because they're irrelevant now that the course is closed and I might make them live again later but those are generally I only go live during those times and you have to catch it during those times you know that's why it's special yeah so they're gonna be yeah once once it goes off it's it's gone important modules like you are a Lib okay that's a good that's a good question your ellipse sucks that Aditya but I understand what you're saying and I'll definitely make on I'll definitely make videos on programming modules the better one then you are a Lib is requests for Python okay I'm gonna go and play another game of chess and then I'll be back because that's what I feel like doing right now all right so let's go um okay see I'm gonna do three minutes because I can still speak in three minutes whereas one minute I can't speak at all it takes too much of my focus okay let's try one minute you guys will get to see my face be really weird I'll try to be normal on livestream but my face gets all weirded up and yeah I won't be able to talk too much but okay so you can see I have one minute he has one minute and we can lose on time or we can win by checkmating each other so right now I'm just trying to attack his dark square pawns like this one and he takes my knight which is okay I'm just gonna castle here okay whoops I overlooked that I'm dropping a pawn but that's you know that sucks but it's not the end of the world oh that is d5 here this is this is getting really ugly now oh there's maid here so I can't even take that okay so now I'm gonna ready to take this pawn or take here I'm down a piece so meaning that I'll very likely lose this game however I'll try my best to hold on here and and see how I do if he moves his Queen away at any point this Knight will hang he sees that and he stops me so now I'll go here and attack this pawn I'll go back here again to just annoy him okay now my counter play is okay if he wants a draw draw if we repeat position three times in chess it's a draw okay if I take here he basically saying he'll play a rook here and then when my bishop so I cannot allow that I'm just gonna run away now this pond should be in trouble he's gonna take here I think oh okay now no no he's not in on any trouble yet but he is low on time so I just have to play really fast here and I think I can do that did he just mess up yeah if he takes now I have this so I just want a piece one second left okay he's trying to trick me but that doesn't matter ooh checkmate okay that was really good actually so let me explain kind of what took place here who I was able to commentate and everything wow this is really awesome okay so I moved here you know he's not any threat because I'm trying to checkmate him cuz I got my bishop and Queen lined up but he has his knight here looking at it so he's still not in any trouble yet but then he plays this move rook to attack my queen now he's thinking okay I'll move my Queen back because if I take his rook then he just takes it back with the bishop and I'm down a queen and queen is nine points whereas the rook is five points so he's expecting me to move back or take here basically just get off this dangerous diagonal except he missed a tactic which is his back rank is really weak meaning that if his queen is not here if my rook comes down here that's a checkmate his King has no squares and so I exploited that I exploited his back rank weakness and I took his bishop because again you know I'm sacrificing my queen temporarily but if he takes my Queen then rook comes here and that's checkmate it's game over so he tried to waste he was really low on time he had about one second left here he he tried this desperate move rook check to waste my time but doesn't change anything I just take that rook and now if he takes my Queen which he did again rook here is checkmate and he was gonna lose on time anyways he had zero seconds I had eight seconds left but I played Road Caron you know just made it him instead so it was a pretty good game and now I'll come back to answer some questions all right let me do this in the quickest way possible I'm getting good at this live streaming stuff Wow there's like so many different moving parts that I got to keep track of and I think is doing fine all right let's see ah Gonzalo I'm sorry about that I see that you you added them to see them later I got you that some some people man ya never give up that's right knee and auntie Annie asks why do we use while / dowhile loops when we have for loop that's a good question for loop is when you know when something ends while loop is when you don't know when something ends so yeah I that's a weird answer I know but you know for example for loops are easier to write I love for loops but while loops are generally you know you'll use them and you don't know when something look for example let's say that you want to play a game that always allows the option of clicking play again at the end so you play a game of tictactoe and then you want it to give you the option of saying play again to start it again you don't know how many times a user that's using your program feels like playing that game they might want to play it thousand times or one time and then close it so you don't want to write a for loop there because in a for loop you might have to say something like for I in range or something like that you know meaning that for 20 times it should say play again for 10 times it should play again but you don't want to hardcode something that says that because you don't know if the user wants to play it 20 times or 10 times or thousand times for one time so you're gonna write a while loop which is pretty much gonna say while true meaning while the player wants to play keep going and as soon as they hit no then the while loop ends so that's an example of a while loop versus a for loop or another while loop might be while not tired from doing pushups keep going because you don't know how many pushes this person will do or a for loop you can say for I in range 20 keep going meaning for 20 pushups you know keep going until 20 pushups hopefully that gives you a little bit of an intuition and a little bit of an understanding between while loops versus for loops I was gonna say Froot Loops I've been playing chess for a while since I was about 14 or 15 high school played one state championships twice and became top 1% in the world fairly quickly because I am obsessive when I get on something I go allin baby so yeah where do you live mmhmm by the way you consolidate you so much I'm humbled to know that I was your inspiration to go back to Python I love hearing that and keep me updated on your progress I'm glad it's been smooth ride so far basic hash function I can't explain that super fast my friend that takes some drawing and screen sharing which I don't have set up right now but Jonathan yeah like they're basically the idea behind hashes is like caches you know see ACH II and it's to help you speed up things to use already existing data ooh Veronica's 16 14 hey if you guys play chess send me a live challenge and I'll play with you you know on Lee chess org I'll play with you there Henry says what should I do after completing my beginners course there are some online videos I have on YouTube you can launch those or straight up you can just try to find some more advanced trainings online on Udacity or a Coursera until of course I relaunch my course in like many months half a year probably and then you know you can join the course then yeah Gonzalo there you go haha ok moronic send me invite my name is Rafa 0 1 which is RAF eh 0 1 send me an invite there and I will accept it and then we will play online and everybody will watch me play against somebody who's in our livestream how freaking cool is that it's basically more onic we're basically gonna be like hanging out on my birthday you know just one on one you know sitting back and drinking some monster and playing some chess Jason Owens the best framework for someone new to Python is flask not Django foreknew not Django I'm not Grandmaster and chess moronic I wish Veronica I don't see your invite my friend my user name is Rafa 01 send me an invite I wonder if you guys can hear me gulping when I'm drinking monster it's almost like an ad let me get sponsored by monster hmm Sahil are gufa function is used to parse commandline arguments let me put on my smart glasses so args is used to powers commandline arguments meaning that you can pass in an argument to your function right from your command line without having to hardcoded into your Python script you can pass that argument as your about to call that script from your command line hopefully that confused you I'm I'm pretty good at understanding what somebody will understand or not and that while the words make sense I don't think you'll actually understand what I'm saying until I show you which I can't do right now in this live stream because I don't have the coding stuff set up here I do like stuff like astrophysics or genetic engineering I'm terrible at them but I'm very curious about those concepts which is why I'll watch these videos by this one guy who's always doing these documentaries on physics and he's explaining all this amazing stuff I forgot his name Tyron Woodley no no that's not I I don't know his name I'm gonna stop guessing I don't have a friend request from you my friend are you sending me a friend request or what I don't see a friend request I'm looking at my inbox I'm looking at everything I don't have a friend request no it's not rough is its raw fate RAF ages zero one like this look I wrote it for you okay let's see what other people are saying let's see interest sensor some interesting questions chase yeah it's it's like think of it like a movie launch you know and it's it comes to the theaters and then it goes away from the theaters and that's how this course works I closed it down because then I want to focus on the group that's inside the course and I want to focus on the course material and improving it and then once it's improved and that cohort kind of goes through that entire course and completes it then I will open it up again for a few days okay so I'll open up it up again in a few months for a few days if you're on my email list basically if you enroll in one of my free courses at clever programmer comm you'll find out all of this information alright let's see a fifteen minute game I don't want to play a fifteen minute game let's play a shorter time frame because it will take too long so I'm gonna cancel this but I'll send you a shorter time control the fans will be like this game is way too long alright so let's do this okay I'm sending you sending your rated threeminute match and let's play so but this guy he's not accepting my challenge what's going on future billionaire here well let's see hopefully gotta get to a million first million dollars is really not that hard like I don't know why people make it sound that hard it's so it's very simple it's very hard if you try to just do it by yourself and like you know by just doing jobs that's what makes it difficult as long as your hours are tied to the amount of money you make it's very difficult and life is very difficult you need to break the chains of work and what you're paid for and if if the only way you can make more money is by working more hours you're gonna be stuck in that cycle for the rest of your life and it's a pretty weird cycle maybe you like it I don't I like being able to do stuff on my own time but if you can find a way where the amount of money are making is not associated with the amount of time you're putting in now you're getting into a very good lifestyle which is why when you're doing when you're doing freelancing or consultations I highly recommend you're not sending me the challenges okay I'm gonna try one more time and if I if you don't accept it then I'm gonna play online with somebody else but okay anyways let me finish my thoughts so the reason why I yeah so what I suggest when you're doing freelancing or when you're consulting is you don't focus on setting hourly rates because that by definition ties you to the hours you should try to set result valuebased pricing is called valuebased pricing and go and learn more about it but that's the type of pricing where you're not charging hourly but you're charging based on a project and it doesn't matter if that project takes you two hours or one week it's just one price so if you get better at it you can do it in like three hours and send it to them completed like for example if somebody tells you to put together a website for them and they want to pay you $5,000 for it and that's the price you guys agree on it doesn't matter it shouldn't matter if you make the website in two hours or take three weeks to make it right that's where your proficiency and skill and how effective you are that comes into play and that starts to break you from the bonds of your hours with the money you're making and then you want to try to find you know after that you want to try to find higher paying clients who have the money don't bother yourself with petty shitty clients like I did for a while I worked with this lady and to this day she gives me nightmares even thinking about it like me and my friend worked our ass off we built everything from scratch like spent 40 hours working on it and you know we wanted to put something on our portfolio and we're like it's gonna be awesome is gonna be so good and after spending like 40 hours or something or more she wanted to pass not even not even three hundred dollars and she made us do like five or seven revisions and we were giving her like that was chump change like I was used to charging clients for that amount over like the five thousand ten thousand dollars and for her I was doing it for cheaper because I at that time I didn't have experience and didn't have a portfolio it didn't have resume so I was like okay I'll do something for cheaper as long as I can build a portfolio and resume but you see the problem that I had there was that I was going to somebody who didn't have money right she wasn't as much as I hated her and then to this day it still makes me angry that somebody would work somebody did that level and just grind them out and not even pay them anything yes she by the way she didn't pay us anything we made no money after 40 hours of work you know the lesson that I learned is go to the people that have money don't go to people who don't have money because it doesn't matter how good harder to they heart they are or how amazing they are you know there's there's no way that they can pay you even if they love you all right I'm gonna go and accept this challenge now Oh somebody else challenged me okay cool moronic I'll play you in a little bit but looks like somebody challenged me here okay guys so I'm playing against somebody on the on the livestream let me ask them so I just sent out a message saying hey did you come here from the livestream and we're playing oh okay cool this person is 1,300 that's really or 1,400 sorry it's a really good reading and let's see how does the game goes so he's developing his pieces that's really good you know you want to control the center and he's doing that you know every move he's playing like look at that pawn here Knights controlling this one this square brilliant chess Bishop here so all of these four squares every move that he's making they're being controlled you know even his queen is controlling those squares and I'm trying to do the same thing in chess you can make this move called castling this is the only time you can move your king and rook at the same time so that's what I'm gonna do you know I'm just gonna play it a little bit safe here he's moves his Bishop here to pressure my knight and you know I have a few options here but I'm just gonna say okay I had take my knight and he says no sir I don't want to take your knight and I'll say okay I'll just kick his Bishop again and then just defend this pawn so he let me expand a little bit on the Queen side which you know is I'm happy with and I'm gonna trade my knight for his Bishop because in chess in middle game if you can get a bishop pair it's usually considered advantageous for the side that has the two bishops hmm there's also Knight c5 in the position this is an interesting position there's nine takes b6 there's also Knight c5 I like Knight c5 mmm I'm gonna play Knight c5 and just just cramp down on him here a little bit still nobody really has you know a huge edge or anything like that it's a pretty closed position okay he decides to take now I can I can take whichever way I want I'm gonna take this way because I want to be able to pressure his it's funny cuz he's hearing all of this so he knows exactly what I'm gonna be doing but it's okay I'm gonna try to pressure this B file here and and let's see how he reacts to this okay I can attack his night which is it's pretty uncomfortable move to deal with it actually I'll see where he goes my pieces are getting a little bit inside of his position which can be a little bit annoying sometimes and I'm just gonna I can also play C six and then a six I move my bishop back he takes a pawn if I move here he can play b5 okay so I'm just gonna try to squeeze him a little bit here and make him a little restricted with his pieces and try to control more squares on the Queen side so he has some light square weaknesses here you know there are lots of light squares my pieces can get into that's kind of what I'm focusing on here so there's a lot of time left he has three minutes have two minutes 49 seconds it's also possible we can get under time trouble and things could start you know going a little bit wrong for us now I think I'm just going to take here he has a better pawn structure that's one of the advantages that he has right now but I am I do want to actually oh wait is bishop c6 here really good did he just miss that I can just play so if I play here and attack his knight and if his knight ever moved I can take his rook that's probably really good there's also c6 there's also 96 too many choices here Knight here it looks pretty good too he can go Queen e8 oh wow after Knight here he can go Queenie and or Queen d7 and in either case I can do Knight takes a 7 there are too many choices here too many choices I think I'm just gonna go Bishop c6 it looks like the simplest way to go I mean he can he can look to sack the exchange meaning he can move his knight and let me take his rook but I like my position better there I think I have winning chances but this is one of those things that happen you know so this is what I was talking about I get these light squares and he's gonna be oh very smart so he actually attacks my queen and breaks the pin at the same time so he is actually a genius I should have done the other thing all right all right no stress I'm just gonna play some solid chess here control squares it's gonna be up a pawn but I'd like to think I have some compensation here okay so he takes there that's expected hmm I am getting a little bit under time pressure here so I do need to keep playing fast he's playing incredibly well okay now I think there's might be some stuff going on on the C file okay if I take here he just takes back but I have 96 right attacking the Queen and the rook so I'm I have a disadvantage right now I'm down multiple pawns but it looks like I'm gonna get my exchange back what about rook here take stakes yeah rook here looks really good and if he don't I just win his rook okay so it looks like he messed up a little bit I think unless he has some resource here but it looks like he won't be able to actually defend this rook at all meaning he can't go Queen here because his queen is under attacks but he can't go Queen here too to defend his rook because I have Knight takes Queen and if he moves his queen let's say here then I can actually take his rook and just be up a rook and I think that's exactly what I'm going to do here I'm gonna play some weird tactical moves here that are gonna give him some trouble and let's see what he depending on what he plays but I have a move in mind that actually so this is a very annoying move to deal with under time pressure yeah so I just want more material there I have rook check here coming which is actually mate if he doesn't watch out for it I'll defend my pawn so he can't take my pawn with his knight he has five seconds left I'm up material so he looks like he's in a lot of trouble yes check but I'll just go back okay very good game it was very very well played and so I think he played really well I just think he got a little bit greedy by taking this pawn I don't I don't think you should take this pawn more natural moves are night here getting his night in the game yeah this this move looks really good he just needs to bring more pieces so he has a lot of activity but he chose instead to take my pawn which then brings this rook to life and he has to watch out for that and also I'm I'm I was looking to clear this Bishop from here so I can land the knight here and he actually allows me to do that and then he and then he gets in a little bit of trouble here okay so really good game and if anybody else wants to challenge I'll accept it and I'm gonna come back and answer your guys questions now okay cool cool cool cool Trump Donald nice chess it's to leech s org allied chess org it's like this and you can actually just go there and play any time it's free let's see somebody else sent me o moronic now sent me a challenge so I'm gonna go and play a challenge with him and then I'll come answer your guys's questions in a second okay so Austin Chang asked me a question Austin is actually in my course he's also on my snapchat which is super cool and he just asked me a question in livestream so I'm gonna answer that and he says if you make a website app for someone and get paid do you are you expected to maintain the site and fix it if something goes wrong I am very clear with my clients about this most of the times I want to deal with headache and me on the call so I will generally make it very clear that once we are done with the deal and they get what they need that's it like I'm out and if something goes wrong they should try to fix it but generally I will make sure that it's very clear I'll bring in a team of testers as third party unit testers and these people will test and make sure everything is working fine it's almost as if you know when you have that if you get into a car accident yeah you know you can call in a third party to unbiased ly look at what happened and like who gets how much money or who was at fault it's sort of like that so it's basically my insurance policy kind of thing you know I'll bring in third party unit testers and they'll test out everything they'll communicate with me they'll communicate with my client and then we part ways because I don't want to deal with that headache unless you're charging them monthly something for it you know $2,000 $4,000 I don't know whatever to you know if something goes wrong it's part of the contract or you can charge them an extra premium in the proposal so then when something like that comes up you're okay with it because you charge that extra premium and they paid it upfront so you can just give them life time like you know maintenance and you also have to understand which clients are working where there's some nasty stingy clients those are the clients you fire and don't work with in the start you want to work obviously I'll try to get any work that you can but try to be very respect yourself don't let shitty people destroy your life there are a lot of people like that who are very stingy watch over every little thing that you do always stay over your shoulder there to always complain and blame will never give you compliments if you do something right or respect you you know or you know so basically watch out for those types of people if you have good clients you'll know that even if you give them lifetime maintenance they're not gonna bother you for no reason unless there's really something wrong so those are the people you cannot be okay with giving them like okay I'll give you maintenance if anything goes wrong but the type of people who's exploited and take advantage of it those are the people you know you really want to run away from just like one of my clients who like literally used and abused us didn't pay us money at the end of the day and had us do like seven or eight revisions even though we were supposed to do only like maybe one revision like we were doing her a favor the entire time okay hopefully that answers the question Rudy that was a really good game you know yeah maybe you were nervous but you shouldn't be because you play really well you only made very few mistakes okay now Marana keeps sending me the challenge so I'm gonna go and accept his challenge and play a moronic moronic is also in the live chat right now so he's actually somebody who's in the live chat sending me a challenge and I'll play him if you guys want to send me a challenge it's my birthday and I'll play you I don't care it's fun all right let's go okay he's not playing let's go come on let's go moronic okay good good good good he finally played he says hi in the chat nice okay so now maybe we're gonna play a joke Oh piano I don't know let's see what he chooses to play here I'm gonna be right back I'm gonna make a quick call and I'll be right back you don't need to give me any extra time or anything this move is not accurate so you want to change that after this game and I'll show you why I'm gonna be back in a second okay all right what's up fellas I'm getting calls for my birthday so I have to go and take them sometimes it's okay you don't need to give me extra time thank you though I appreciate it okay so I'm gonna take here and the idea is that if he takes my night I fork him right and if he takes here I take here and I still get the center basically black is trying to control the center and if black can play these two moves a 5 and d5 black has a quality pretty much so that's really what I'm going for now I have a feeling we'll get a pretty sharp game and let's see how he deals with this move and I think now it's gonna get very tactical because his knights hanging hanging but my Knights hanging and if he takes my knight and take him back he takes here it's a fork he's looking at my king in my rook so let's see how moronic deals with it I won't do too many calculations because then again then he knows exactly what I'm calculating but you know I'll try to calculate more after the game and show you guys some of this stuff and and yeah I'm gonna be playing at a chess tournament this weekend it's gonna be a really huge tournament and people from all over the world actually come to play there um I'm wondering if I could take there here here here I mean why can't I just on passant and keep this oh my queen is hanging it oh my god okay ah I almost played pawn takes here but just realize my Queens hanging okay well I don't have a choice process of elimination my friend the ultimate process that's how I do coating as well process of elimination I'm wondering if I can play here you played there I play here no no no that I can't go there that doesn't make sense um this position is annoying let's see I can go there okay okay let's say I go here and just put more pressure on him what is happening here this is a it's a complicated position they're a bunch of things going on and basically we both have to figure it out you know we don't know what moves to play and we're trying to figure our way out of this complication so you place queen there which is a mistake just gonna calculate it one more time yeah I should be fine here yeah it was already defended so he didn't need to do that I love a bunch of pawns here but I am very low on time maybe I should just play it fast here whatever oh my god I'm an idiot okay that's the move I should not have played yeah because of that but okay let's look for some counter play I I'm really long time 30 seconds left and it looks like he's about to get the advantage what what am i doing I should have taken his this is just bad that's what it is okay 26 seconds to 2 minutes and 37 seconds he looks to be in a better position I do have a bunch of pawns for the trouble but I am I'm getting in a lot of trouble right now so I'm just gonna get out of the way really long time really suffering here not doing good at all let's see what he's got planned next surely poor time management on my part okay so he's attacking here when I attacked there he has struts of going Bishop there but you know the pressure my c7 pond I think I should be okay we'll see this is a very tough position here for me and more than position the time is a huge factor okay hopefully I'm not allowing any tactical shots here because I would get in a lot of trouble if I do so I have 11 seconds here's one minute 13 seconds he wants to trade in two opposite colored bishop endgame but um I'm on his f2 pawn so I'm not sure how he wants to deal with that Oh sneaky sneaky he's trying to mate me in the back rank okay oh wait that's that doesn't make any sense I thought that move was so good but it's not it's too much time trouble actually yeah so he knows I'm pretty much done here especially with the time trouble that I'm in oh okay good game good game here I miss my chance I kept thinking about this but I so I lost the game he played really well and great game great game so here's where it really happened so the reason why I played here was so I could play here next but then for some reason I forgot but yeah I should just play here he takes my pawn I take his pawn in and then it's a draw but good game very nice let's see if we have new challengers we have another challenger Lara fall and I'm gonna play one game with her and moronic I think we need to play a rematch my friend will play a rematch at some point great game though great game okay let's see if there's any new questions how were you one direction yeah I get that Zayn all right cool now let's go and play the game okay ooh that's an interesting move checkmate be careful about pushing this pawn in this pawn Laura and are you are you in livestream I mean you have to be I think pretty sure so okay so basically be careful about pushing this pawn and this pawn because you can get in some trouble like that check a median criminis game I didn't realize no no how they're five minutes 16 seconds okay cool anybody else wants a challenge go ahead we'll play another game oh I gotta close this maybe I'm not so good at this livestream thingy alright let's go down yeah I'm answering questions about coating as well Karl so few questions for coating I will do that ratchet says for the first time in my life I was enjoying chess cool I'll also make some kind of chess game for you guys Muhammad says cause you started learning Python for like 3 weeks but then it got hard and there are a few places and then I stopped look you can't stop when things get difficult there are tons of online resources but focus on making it enjoyable so then even if it's hard you'll still do it for example I don't know your relationship with your wife if you have a wife you know things get really difficult but you enjoy spending your time with her so you'll still go through very difficult things to do that and you won't just stop you know if you like eating cake you'll travel really far to Cheesecake Factory to get that delicious cheesecake or that extremely good fried rice at your favorite Thai place you know even if it's really hard you'll still keep going so as long as the thing that doing is enjoyable that's why really focus on making it something you enjoy that's why I always say 80 155 rule which is play 80% of the time build 15% of the time and learn 5 percent of the time reduce your time learning and get naturally good at it by playing with it and getting a feel for it to play me go to leech s org and just send me an invite my user my username is Rafa's or one and then you can play me like that on leech s no GS is really good I prefer Django so I would go with Django but there's nothing wrong with no Jess or Django they're both really really good it just depends if you are already skilled at Python then maybe go for Django and if you're more skilled with JavaScript then maybe go with node J s both of them are serverside you know frameworks mmhmm any new challenges no new challenges yeah I'll make a chassis eye and let it play for me actually okay moronic um let's see okay if nobody's sending me in our match from here I'm just gonna play against somebody online so let me know if you guys are gonna be doing that or not alright so I'm gonna play against somebody online play you know it's much harder to play and commentate than I thought it's definitely much more difficult because I'm always thinking I'm used to thinking quietly especially when I'm playing at a tournament in a very quiet but I got it you know it's just a skill I have to practice it so the more out I think out loud the better I'll get at it now he's starting to make some weaknesses in g3 and f2 but I think he knows the opening that he's playing if I take Knight c5 looks really good I'm gonna do that even though it's supposed to be slightly more passive for me you know I'm I am okay with this position because there's this long diagonal play that I get and I'm gonna try to exploit that diagonal now I wonder but I can play Knight h5 and we just trade a bunch of pieces I kind of I like don't mind this line at all I'm on here my Knights coming to places maybe and I mean yeah sure those straight Queens as well I don't care so we've traded down quite a bit okay now I'm trying to poke at his queen side so I can take take and then open up some position there night of four looks pretty night each four looks good to me I can also take take and put a ruck on the C file so there there's multiple ways to go about it there's 92 and 94 it's my maneuver here which she overlooked so I like my night on this square and it's actually a little bit tricky for him to challenge my night I should have actually put this rook on the B file because if he ever it takes I can take okay now he's getting oh that's why he played rook here so he's ready to challenge my knight um I'm gonna play here I'm okay with this all his pawns are on light squares so if we trade nights it should be okay for me in this position also playing Knight d5 and that's okay because now I just have a superior night so I was superior minor piece and all his pawns are on light squares which means his bishop has low mobility and I mean I'm just better here to be honest he like might have to sacrifice in exchange but there's no way to kick this Knight he can't do anything to this Knight so this Knight is just dominating and it's on a dark square so this Bishop would never take him now ruk is five points so he doesn't want to give up a rook for the night because rook is worth five points in Knights three points I also have Knight a5 at some point I wonder if I can play f5 here okay let's see I can play h5 take stakes take over they take over the hfile but I don't see well all I have to do I think to win is just trade down trade all the pieces till is just a night in a bishop and then I think my night should prove to be you know prove enough for a for a win I always have night f5 here he has to be careful about that so yeah okay so this is guys hanging I have to protect him for a second it's night c2 in the position okay again rook e8 threatening Knight f5 so if he plays that five I just take it that's you know he messed up here and then there's Knight h4 at some point if he is not careful yeah I'll just take this pawn and there's g5 and then Knight g6 95 yeah I should be okay here I'm just up to pawns I have 40 seconds just 57 seconds it just means I need now need to play quicker to win this I'm gonna make this my last game and then I'll answer some questions that you guys have there's Knight a5 again if he goes to e3 then I can go to night of 594 and one in one smooth motion there's still night of five because I have rookie 3 so I will actually play that because I rookie 3 and then I can actually take this guy here like that then there's rook h2 and now I'm threatening mate idea so he might need to trade a rock or two with me okay sure nice rock is hanging and I'm threatening mate I mean this is pretty reasonable for him he should just resign here there's nothing he can do it Moses Rock I just take if you move this rook oh yeah he can actually move this rook here or that that's fine so now I'm threatening to take here or rook here he has two seconds left I have 20 seconds really difficult position for him yeah I should actually just go here and here threatening to take here so and once he takes I take or yeah take this way and then I have passed pawns okay so I want this game yeah really the critical moments are you know this idea that because in chess you don't always have like a really obvious advantage you know when you're playing at a higher level that's not only about checkmating the other person you have to try to win some material but even more than that sometimes even winning material is not that easy so you have to find different ideas and right now my idea was okay my Knights really good all his pawns are on light squares which is not a good idea for him because it blocks in is at his own bishop as you can see that my lights my knights on dark square so it's just a better piece than this guy cuz he can't even take me and it's protected just an outpost in the center of the board so all I have to do is actually open up this hfile and then get my rooks in the game and then trade my rooks and then just be with King King and Night vs Bishop or I'm better and it was really this key maneuver that I think you know won the game is here here and this one right here you know so subtle moves but definitely you know very powerful and important to keep in mind I also missed a lot of things for example this pawn is pinned so I can take here and once he takes back I can take with the knight and once he takes I can take his Bishop so there are a bunch of things I missed too in the game but okay that's it for this game I have a challenge from Justin I don't want to play ten minutes with eight seconds my friend that is very long let's try to do five minutes so send me another challenge Mazur I definitely don't upload unlimited time so please send me a challenge with five minutes okay so I'm gonna decline these right now but I want to play with you just make them a little bit shorter in the meantime I'll jump over try to answer some programming stuff questions and then we'll come back here and play some some chests with you guys so let me jump back into the livestream here okay yeah I wish Kasparov was here yeah you can go to my course on clever programmer dot teachable calm and that's where all the courses are located and then we'll play no challenges huh okay so make sure that you can send me a challenge Austin I forgot what your name was here I can't find it anywhere things like Austin Jay Austin I don't know I totally forgot Austin oh my god there's so many Austin's I'll never have luck finding you here okay so let's see what do you recommend after I finished learning Python PHP or JavaScript if you finish learning Python I thought I would have you focus on actually developing real apps and real useful things with pythons because if you're done learning now the whole point of being done with learning is so now you can do the really enjoyable stuff which is actually creating things and bring your ideas to life but if you're just interested in learning another language after Python outside JavaScript and not PHP PHP sucks okay I'm gonna go and now play the game so I got the challenge I'm an accept Justin's challenge Jay Austin sorry and now you guys should be able to see okay Austin good luck so he opens with the King pawn that's a really good move he's controlling the center he moves his knight out again controlling the center the entire time very good I don't actually know what his rating is so the amount of time he's taking on this move I would guess that maybe his rating is like 900 800 like maybe he's really new to chess because this is actually known as the Scotch defense so if you're familiar with it you would play these moves pretty fast now on his Knight I have two pieces attacking the knight he has one piece defending it which means that if he doesn't move it then I could win it but he could also just choose to protect it which is exactly what he did I'm gonna go and pressure that night a little bit more when I tickle that night getting lots of calls and have your bird the emails is beautiful thank you guys so much I really appreciate it I know that some of you guys who were emailing me are also in this livestream which is amazing thank you thank you thank you bishop here is a tricky move why can't I just take take and take I'm gonna win upon I will do that so I think Austin missed the fact maybe unless he's he's doing something I don't see but he missed the fact that I had three attackers on the night you need two protectors he brought his bishop in to attack the knight but you know I moved the knight out to attack his knight right away so his bishop actually couldn't take my knight okay good defense he has to he had to watch out for a queen takes f2 and Bishop takes b2 he has protected both so that's really good I will develop a peace here in chess you want to constantly it's called development you want to focus on bringing your pieces into the game as fast as possible so you don't wanna I don't call pawns pieces I call pieces pieces so meaning when I say pieces I'm talking about these guys I'm not talking about these little tiny guys these guys you want to keep in the back row and try not to move them too much because once you move upon up it can never go back so if you move a pawn up and one of these squares becomes weak or you move these pawns up now you don't have shelter for your king that could be a problem okay Jay Austin Austin says happy birthday by the way he says great courses with a Python classes so he actually really likes the courses thank you so much and I'm glad that you're actually enjoying the courses I mean I personally think it's you know really useful Python course thank you sir all right now okay so he plays Bishop d3 I like that move but I am worried he's making lots of moves with his Queen and Bishop you know he's breaking opening rules in the opening you should never move one piece twice you should try to move all your pieces once before you move any one piece twice meaning that you know he shouldn't play with his Bishop here and then bring the bishop back here and waste two moves on him instead he should just move his Bishop here and then move his knight out and instead of moving his Queen here and here he should have just moved his Queen here and one go and then moved the bishop out with the next move so his position would look a lot different if he didn't waste and he moves his knight would be here and his bishop would be out here but now you know he since he waited a little bit it's possible he could get into a little bit of trouble but I still don't have a strong attack or anything but I'm trying to bring my pieces out as fast as possible so I played this move not only to control the center but also opening up my bishop so my bishop can actually join the game he has trouble developing some of his pieces because of my battery here okay good he wants to maybe put his knight on c4 one day no problem mate go ahead and do that he still has trouble developing that bishop because my ID can go here um okay what if I play an annoying move like b5 hmm just gonna play here I'm kind of fixing my pawn structure which is something I shouldn't be doing right now but you know I kind of like it I don't know kind of like controlling those dark squares like that my guy was more interested in Italy in playing c6 and then pushing this pawn up oh so when I'm saying stuff like c6 or d6 or Knight g4 I'm really looking at the coordinates so like in chess you can see this so there this file is called H file because there's a H written underneath it and this square every square has a name in chess just like your home everybody has a home unless you're homeless but if you have a home your home has an address and just like that in chess each square has an address so this is the H H squared because it's in the H file files go up and down and 8th ranked ranks go sideways so this square is H 8 you know let me ask you and you say it out loud if I point to it so what is this square called you know try to do this fast as you can give you three seconds three two one the squares be four right B be file and then rank is four so this is the squares be four how about this square quickly H 3 okay how about this square C 2 this be one so just like that so this rook on a one right now is hanging meaning it doesn't have any defender so I'm just gonna take it we got a few more challengers and I'll play till the challenges are here which is super cool you know I had some I'm really happy and thank you guys for actually playing with me but I really appreciate it you know it's something I love chess and it's awesome that I get to do it on my birthday and play with you guys like this is unreal this was never a possibility you know last year this wouldn't have been something that's possible I kind of loved how the internet works you know you're in some different part of the world and you and I are just sitting here and you know able to play this facetoface it's it's really incredible so he's very sneaky he's trying to win the game by you know kind of tricking me a little bit meaning that if I just play like a random move here let's say I play my pawn up here to kick his kick his knight or something his idea is that he can take my pawn here and that would almost be checkmate so I don't want to let him do that and I will play an annoying move here I'm gonna play this move and now his problem is that if he takes my bishop I just take it and if he goes and tries to take my pawn on the square what square is this quickly if he takes my pawn on b7 then I can take his Bishop on d3 the reason why I speak we speak in coordinates is so we're very specific about what we're talking about also when you know when I was training it also allowed me to read and study from chess books because you know there's no person there so you have to read from a actual you know chess book I'm trying to see if I have some kind of killing blow here maybe clean edge for threatening that mmhmm I don't think so I'm just gonna play it simple and trade some pieces I'm I'm up a rook so I can I'm up a rock in a few pawns so I can just choose to play here pretty safely here's another tip I want to give you guys when you're ahead in material try to just trade pieces you don't have to do anything fancy just try to trade pieces and get to as few pieces as possible because somebody who's losing they want to trick you right so the more pieces there are on the board they're more they're more chances there are of you actually getting tricked and losing so when you trade pieces you keep making the game simpler and simpler because they're less and less pieces and then there have less chances of tricking you so if somebody if you have two extra pieces but they're still they have six pieces and you have eight pieces the game can still be complicated but imagine if you traded all the pieces now they have zero pieces and you have two pieces now it's like no cop no complication at all it's actually very simple so there's a trick here his rook is actually unprotected so I have a trick here what I want to do is if this bishop didn't exist right imagine if this mission I just take it off the board it doesn't exist I would be able to just take his rook but this Bishop does exist so what I want to do here is move this Bishop which Czech sacrifice it so if once he takes it with his King now his rook is hanging so that's really his problem here and what I'll try to do is I'll try to simplify the game even more but by throwing in this check and this really simplifies the game so now he's forced to trade Queens and we have even traded Queens and as you can see we have very few pieces left on the board now but the game is getting simpler and simpler now I'm attacking his end Bishop I will play here and protect his pawn I have 42 seconds he has 18 seconds so he does need to be a little bit mindful of his time I'm just gonna play d4 and just push this pawn all the way through I think it's gonna be very difficult for him to protect and stop this idea I don't see any easy way to stop this idea for him just I mean this just pawns just going through so he chooses to sacrifice as Knight and I now as you can see there's so many pieces I have and he only has you know just a few pieces here let's see I'll play here now I have some ideas of taking that okay a very good game so he played pretty well but he you know in the end he got in a little bit of trouble he overlooked a few tactics yeah so here I would suggest for him instead of moving his bishop out maybe just focus on protecting this knight or just moving this knight out of the way you know instead of going Bishop here cuz automatically he gives me a pawn and then after that there are some other inaccuracies like giving me the full rook that was the biggest mistake you know when you see my Queen and Bishop on this diagonal don't push this pawn up and as soon as he did I just take his rook okay let's see if there are any questions for me to answer burning painful questions madness jack says he could make me cry in chess let's go madness Jack I'm gonna make you weep on livestream mmm let's go I'm round ready madness jack but you know I don't like crying so don't make me cry please let's see thank you thank you for wishing me happy birthday when does the next course open mullahs probably in five six months from now you know I I don't always know Sylvio Gaming asked your thought about the mean stack and he spelled it stash yeah but I know what you're talking about yeah I know I know mean stack is basically pretty sure it's what does the M I forget it sometimes but a is for angular and E is for something I keep forgetting this okay let's look it up mean stack yeah is for angular and it's for node and I forget the Ian M is for yeah I think Emma's from yeah okay so Express yeah it's a very good stack to learn and to get familiar with but it is very complicated for MongoDB you need to know sequel you know it's not based on sequel programming language because it literally says no sequel but you do need to know the concepts behind sequel and jumping straight into MongoDB is a lot more difficult not definitely not as straightforward as just doing something with regular databases once you do something with regular databases then I recommend to look into MongoDB angular is another framework that's pretty damn tricky so you definitely need to be very comfortable with building websites from scratch just using HTML and CSS before you can really go on and take advantage of angular so I would I would do this a little bit later same thing with node it's a little bit more complicated so you want to be familiar with JavaScript before you start going allout into node so that's what I would say on that question it's a good stack but those are the things that are required for it so before you do MongoDB learn a little bit of sequel before you do angularjs learn how to make websites from scratch using HTML using CSS you javascript go to websites like free code capcom you can learn from there as well how to build you know websites and then for no js' you know same thing they'll teach you a lot of JavaScript and then you can pick up node along as a way yeah pleather games.you so if I play I recently I have haven't been gaming too much but I do play Gears of War and I play some other games but yeah I am you know I I really like chests and I've been playing chests for a long time usually I I try not to spend my time gaming I try to just be very productive throughout the day it's very rare that I actually even play any games anymore my days look like I wake up at 430 a.m. in the morning then I'm going to lift then I come back a shower you know get coffee I'm like with what I have done usually by 1100 a.m. or 1200 p.m. is like most people's entire week's worth of work or like day's worth of work and usually that's done by 1100 a.m. or 1200 p.m. there's another thing I like about waking up in the morning and then after 1200 p.m. I just get to beat everybody and be ahead of everybody because I have from 12 p.m. to 10 p.m. to do more stuff so then I read book you know and sneak in some time with a friend or to make content for this channel club or programmer make new videos or you know write out an email to you guys so that you know those are the things I'm gonna be I'm doing John Smith says co2 software on live please yeah definitely what I'll do is I've been thinking about this just do live stream kind of casual where you guys were watching over my shoulder and I make an app or I'm starting to work on something and I can show you guys how a framework like flask and Django and whatever works and how does HTML speak with Python code and how does that speak with CSS and all of that but I do need you guys to in the meantime you know go and learn the basic stuff so then when I'm making those more advanced videos you guys can follow along I don't want to make something that only like one percentage of this channel can get value from whereas I'm trying to focus on stuff that you know 99.9% of the people on this channel can get value from that's why I don't want to get too specific all the time with one framework but definitely you can expect live trainings like that John okay so we have a few more challenges I'm gonna go and take a look at those challenges Tory Maps and Mohammed I'm gonna play with Tory Maps accept the challenge okay so hi Tori ah thank you so much she says happy birthday or he or she um I don't know hopefully she'll tell me in the chat but it doesn't matter cuz we're gonna play this game of chess okay so Tori starts off with an interesting opening move g4 which doesn't control the center so I'm kind of against it but you know it could be pretty interesting she's moving her pieces to the side of the board okay cool I am going to put my bishop here you know sometimes your opponent's could have a sneaky strategy which you're not watching out for and you could get in a lot of trouble so you know I like to think that I know what I'm doing but you know maybe I would get in a lot of trouble so I got a focus all right maybe I'll take this pawn now because it wasn't protected this Knight is very scary I don't know what Tori's gonna do with this night so I got to keep an eye out on this guy cuz he can jump in here any time and fork my king and rook so I want to make sure that my queen is here protecting that stuff okay sneaky tori is trying to win this pawn here I'm going to move here and defend upon hmm let's see okay I am very scared of that night so I'm gonna have him move because that night is giving me like trauma oh my god now the other nights coming in jeez okay so this night is in trouble a little bit with my pawn could take it at any time so she does have to be a little bit careful and there's another sneaky little thing that I am threatening which she needs to be careful about but maybe she'll see it or maybe she'll miss it we will see okay so Tori is being really nice to me giving me this cute little checkmate she played really well and here is the point I would point out so this is a common thing that you guys can try this is a technique you guys can try against anybody bring your Bishop out here put your Queen here and then take care in checkmate so I'll show you this you can actually use it to checkmate people in four moves as little as four moves and it's a very good idea to actually do against you know maybe you're playing with friends or a family or anybody and you want to oneup them you know beat them quickly you can try this so I'll show you so for example let's just say White's playing some simple you know let's flip the board here so we can see it from White's perspective flip board so let's say that you're playing here you put this bishop here to look at this pawn so it looks like they're just playing natural moves to bring pieces to the center except look at this your Queens looking at this point your bishops looking at this pawn and there's only King defending it so if you take it that's it let's checkmate there's no move that black has game over lights out and it's it took only four moves so you guys can actually try this Bishop out Queen out and then go for a check like a slumber checkmate like Danielle wrench says okay I'm gonna go back um let's see I have never coated and at Johanna's Lucan says have you ever coated an Android app with Python I've never coated an Android app with Python but you can do it using a framework called Kiwi ki wwhy okay I'm drinking monster Muhammad Kamran okay now I'm going to see the live challenges and accept a one of them okay last challenge it's basically Ridge I don't know how to say his name but rides to hike 180 he wants a rematch so we're gonna play a rematch against him and then uh sorry I keep saying this but this but I have so much fun sitting here and talking with you guys I'm playing with you guys but I really got to get going after this one so it's gonna this definitely is gonna be the last game and I'll try to answer some questions before leaving but yeah so I'm gonna focus here for this game now but this is gonna be the last challenge for today guys okay if I play e5 what's a story takes takes takes takes oh that doesn't work okay so I will just play here he's a very good player Oh what is he so very interesting line and Kings Indian I never really looked into this so I'm trying to fight for the center and that's why I pushed my pawn up but in the opening and for much of chess you know most of the chess is based on those four magical squares in the center and whoever wins the battle over the center ends up winning the game okay he just decides to move away um did I miss anything no no he's just giving me one free pawn here so I'm gonna take that pawn and I'm gonna keep it I'm a pawn grabber I'm gonna tell them you know in chess you want to work with small advantages and make them bigger and bigger and you want to do the same thing with you know software development and programming you like learn a few things and you keep using those to you know get better and better so in chess that's what I'm doing I just take one advantage and then I try to make it bigger and bigger before I just had a slight positional advantage and now I want a pawn and now I might actually win two pawns hold on what's the story here oh I have a dirty tactic here yeah this is not looking good for my friend Raj Dyke I took in a unintuitive way but the bishop first generally you know you take with the knight first and with the bishop and then I would hit the rug but here he's quite frankly just in a lot of trouble I'm a bunch of pawns now I just want to trade I want to make the game simpler so to make the game simpler all I want to do is just trade stuff and as long as I trade stuff like I win you know that's that's pretty much the story there so I just want to keep you know getting the pieces off the board and that's it I have a fivepoint advantage okay so he wants to take my queen I'll just take his queen make my life simpler and then I want to put my bishop here my bit my rook wants to come into game so I want to move my bishop so I can get my rook in the game and yeah now my advantage is pretty huge in this game it's very difficult for him because I have so like for this rook I have this stroke for that rook I have disrupt so that's even right except I have this one bishop and that gives me a pretty big advantage oh is he getting made it here yeah I think he just got made it that's made okay so that was checkmate he kind of overlooked that idea so what he needs to play here is king g1 and that way when I move my rook here it's not a check but he played King h2 and that's a big mistake because after rook here he moves his king out and that's checkmate because bishops guarding the rook um yeah so let's let's point out where he made the mistake he he dropped his pawn that's a mistake and then the next mistake was here where my rooks still looking at this Bishop so what I did is I took took took and now my knight and his knight and his queen is attacked so a lot of trouble okay that's it I am done with chess for now thank you guys so much for the challenge request let's see if there's a question waiting for me coteacher says i'm a tech youtuber do you have some tips for me anybody that asks for business advice or you know youtube advice that some somewhere I am I don't want to say an expert but I definitely think I can offer you a lot of valuable advice there especially with YouTube or building your brand or channel or starting your business or startup you know things like that I would suggest to you that make helpful content consistently so if you are I don't know how many subscribers do you have tell me how many subscribers do you have coteacher but if you have very few subscribers let's say you have 50 or a hundred I want you to focus on making content consistently and when I was starting out I was doing constant content like at one video a day till something sticks and try to tackle like popular questions or popular topics if you're starting out but be consistent with the work that you're putting in so don't just like do it two videos and then stop and then three videos and stop and do that's the worst thing you can do okay one point 3000 is quite a bit that's good code teacher tell me how many subscribers do you get every day and when did you start your channel there's a little bit of lag in my stream so I have to actually you know whatever I say you guys here after like 20 seconds for something you guys are insane you guys have like wait gonzalo you have 1377 subs or are you saying how many subs coteacher has okay so alright one year are going one year ago in three months so I don't know how many subs you get per day but I would assume not too many because you got one that 1.3 thousand and one year and three months so post okay yeah post consistently posts about popular topics and then the video that should cover the most general or the most interesting topic right sometimes it you even have to name it something that you know it's not scammy but it feels scamming to you sometimes like for example it took me a long time to make the video for easy ways to make money online like that's such a scam me scam me quote unquote title but I did have a lot of valuable information so if I do give it a boring title oh realistic title there's gonna be nobody that watches it but the people who watch it then what I did is make sure the quality of that content was so damn good and so on point and the things that I show you they're so tangible you can actually use them to make money especially if you're trying to be a programmer that so what happens is there are two things you make it on a topic that's popular so now people watch it not to the thing is that if it's good content people want to share it so now it's that that one person coming to you is really two people coming to you it's like doubling or tripling the views and based on who's sharing it and how big of a following they have then there are more views coming in from there and more shares happening there so if you tackle a general hot topic you definitely want to make make sure that that video is really good and not just you sitting on a webcam speaking especially for channels starting out that will really give you a boost Jana Jeon thank you for wishing me happy birthday I saw your message in facebook I really appreciate it and coteacher who work on small goals right so for subscribers then you know your goal should be okay I want to now get to six subscribers every day or ten subscribers every day but if you make a video every day seven days a week thirty videos a month your subscribers should grow really fast and then if you want to slow down you can giant says hey Kazi any tips on how to concentrate and code for more time how to get rid of any distractions so I always like to code outside of my house because with your house you associate I don't know going to the bathroom reading a book watching Game of Thrones sitting watching Netflix playing a game playing guitar playing chess hanging out with friends sleeping there's so many things associated with your mind that I don't like to be at home and I'm working so my home for a while was Panera Bread and Starbucks and now it's my office so if you can afford it get an office you can get it for like you can get pretty good places for seven eight hundred bucks a month but if that's too expensive then you know just go to Starbucks or go to Panera Bread or go go to some local place that has a calm vibe that you like and then you can associate getting coffee and working there so then every time you go there you kind of go in your zone and then also listening to music but very specific kind of music music distracts me a lot and whenever I listen to music I start like listening to the lyrics and I'm just like singing along with them so listen I like to listen to like I go on Spotify I go in genres I click on moods and then I go to the playlist called focus or like brain food and those are playlists that play songs that don't have words is just very calm relaxing background music that's not annoying at all so that should help you yeah your coteacher listen your HTML series you can't say four easy ways to make money and then teach HTML that doesn't make sense so don't make it it doesn't have to be click baby or anything HTML itself is popular you just have to make sure you have 1520 videos on it and they're good quality content that's what happened with my Python programming course it was like it had no views for a while and then I had you know when I had for two videos or three videos or four videos but then when I got like 15 or 20 videos like people are going through and they're like holy this is good send a link to their friend or share it or something and then more people come in and then YouTube start seeing wow these people are spending a lot of time on this one programming Python playlist so then you to start suggesting this playlist to everybody else cuz now YouTube's algorithm doesn't favor how much percentage of your video is watched but rather how many minutes of your videos watched so don't shoot for making short videos because it doesn't matter if you make a 1 minute video that has a hundred percent watch time because if you because what's better is if you have a 1 hour long video that has a two minute watch time on average that one is actually better even though the first one has a higher completion rate because it was so short YouTube doesn't care they want people to spend more time on your channel so the one hour long video that gets watched for only two minutes for whatever reason actually gets suggested more often so when you have a playlist and you have people spending more time in that playlist your channel and your playlist and your videos are being recommended to more and more and more people so yeah and this is another thing that I want to talk about you know guys this this idea of consuming versus creating focus on creating content don't get in the habit of consuming content so meaning even if you suck in programming and you are like you have the worst skills ever and you're slow type or whatever make a video about what you're struggling with you the video could literally be about I don't get this thing you could talk for a few minutes and talk about that and then in the comments people could help you or they could identify with you going through the same struggles you could literally just document your own journey you don't even have to create anything new and later it could serve as you know first of all obviously you can get money from YouTube okay cool another thing that's really amazing I think is that you have this thing you can always go back and refer to so if you're covering some topics in a video it's there for you it only makes your understanding better when you're trying to teach it and three like some of my friends have gotten jobs because of their YouTube channel so it's possible that if you're even talking about software development and coding you can get an injunction or something cuz people be like wow this person is very dedicated so you know a lot of the times I hear people go it's so risky I don't want to start a channel what if it fails or I don't want to start a business you could be like 40 years old and have a business or a channel or you could be 40 years old and have no business and no channel like those are the two options the one I like is being 40 and having you know the channel and a business because very often I mean what are you gonna substitute that time with most of the times will substitute that time with watching house of cards so instead of spending your time watching a TV show you can build a business so the only risk is you don't get to watch as much house of cards or Game of Thrones you know so it's not really a risk and I suggest getting in the habit of creating content whether you want to write you're scared shitless of being on camera then you know just focus maybe on writing or overcome your fear of being in front of the camera and if you're not that afraid of being in front of the camera then you know make a video because I think it's so easy to create video versus sitting and writing but yeah I went on a little bit of tangent there but that's just a little bit of my philosophy and hopefully should be applicable outside of just YouTube yeah coteacher good luck best of luck to you keep me updated on how your channel is doing but just make sure that when you make the content make it damn good you know don't make it a PowerPoint hiding behind camera I like put some life into it make it interesting watch like okay let's say you want to make HTML series goal type in HTML course or something HTML on YouTube and the most popular one that comes up watch them and see how what are the things that they're doing what are their energy levels when they're speaking do they have a camera are they recording themselves in the video like what is it they're doing and then don't steal what they're doing but model what they're doing right so make your videos like them don't just like steal their content you can still make your own course your own curriculum but see a lot of what's working and then try to make it like that you know don't have one of those annoying tutorials where it's like some guy has the notepad on the screen and instead of just speaking to you he's like typing stuff on the notepad and then it's like you just have to read like what he's talking about I find those so annoying and those channels are always suffering so just try to make good normal quality content okay what is sooji said sujeet says how do free apps one will fall I did do private chest lessons I might still do them email me about it but I'm getting very like oneonone time I'm getting very crazy with my time I'm trying not to do too much oneonone with anybody cuz I want to focus on making content that helps the whole world so that's why oneonone is getting tougher and tougher for me as time progresses and I'm actually really trying to step away from it to be honest but yeah I did used to do private chess lessons okay so Sajid says how do free apps like whatsapp makes money so free apps make money by holding the attention of the audience once you build the audience they're unlimited amount of ways of making money you can sell them anything the number one thing is just having an audience and having people there this is very important to understand meaning even if your want to be a programmer you want to create an app most people think oh I'll just create a super awesome app and everybody will get it that's unfortunately not what will happen here's what will happen you will work you will work really hard you will spend years of your time you will spend money resources you will take risks you will put your family at risk by maybe reducing your job or quitting your job and taking that big initiative big jump maybe starting your own business to make that app because you believe in it so much and then when you launch it and it's out there in the market which you'll hear is cricket's nobody gets it and the reason is not because your app is not good or blah blah blah the reason is you don't have an audience so if you don't have anybody to get it what the hell is the point of your material or course that was one of the biggest realizations I had when I was working on some of my courses cuz I've always loved teaching and I built my chest a stick business which you know I I say it's fail old but really I just stopped working on it but it's called chest tastic comm and it's still online but I don't really do anything with it too much but you know what I lost my train of thought or somebody could remind me in the chat but Jesus I just had a train wreck oh yeah I remember now so make sure that you have an audience before you so basically my chest tastic channel I made these amazing phenomenal chess courses and then I was like okay I'll just sell them great and nobody ever bottom nobody took me up on my offer and it was like months of time I spent months on like designing the logo spending money on the logo you have to understand I was 17 or 18 years old even younger maybe 16 years old when I was building that company and I had no like real money you know as like a little bit of money but it wasn't a lot of money and I'm going to college I'm doing jobs so to invest my time there you know I wouldn't say risky but took a lot of effort and so that was the biggest problem you know there's no audience so even if you're building sass which is which it stands for SaaS you know software asaservice something like Spotify that's a sass write software as a service it's all automated and it's a software but it's like a service you just pay for it monthly and you get it you know if you want to build things like that or you know there's so many things I just can't come up with examples right now even to sell that you need an audience beforehand so it's important to understand how to build audience and then you can you know then when you build an app you which don't want to do is build an entire app and then try to sell it to them you want to build like a very small lightweight version of it that maybe takes you 2 to 3 weeks of your time and then put it out there and then people are using it and enjoying it then you can keep adding in new versions the great thing is you already have two instead we're ready to you know basically like you basically have to confirm with them that they'll buy your app before you ever make it and that reduces your risk reduces any chances of failure and that's something I could really help you I know that's super you know it's a tangent and it's something that you guys can't see yourself there yet but it's one of those you want to wrap it away in your head and once you get good at programming or a specific thing you know you could really use this to kickstart your own business gonzalo thank you so much take care have a good one my friend yeah coteacher it's it's not for earning money but just to cover the cost of YouTube yeah camera setup I understand when I started my channel I just like went crazy bought a $5,000 iMac like basically had to take loans to do that bottle I it's bought camera bought so many things and I had to take loans to do that because I didn't have money when I was starting out our very little money and and yeah like I was I mean was just my passion I wanted to get this message heard and across I didn't even care at that time about money or anything I just wanted just to be heard and so I just did it with whatever I had and with whatever I could I just believed in making quality content so that's really why I invested so much you don't need to invest that like I honestly think is stupid if I were to do it now I'll just do it with regular camera and stuff but it was enjoyable to me and I enjoyed it so you know if it's something that you enjoyed then go through with it and do it Ryan that is great to hear my friend that's good glad you're loving the courses and you're redoing them and you're grinding every day for several hours a day just really the only ways to do it you know it's not this field is there's no quick like you know a few days and you'll get success or you'll start making money you'll start landing clients or get a job it does take time it does take a lot of consistent effort redoing things prac saying but then once you start getting their rewards they are pretty unlike any other field and the amount of options you have right but you have to enjoy the journey of programming you have to learn to enjoy it so then even when it gets really hard it's not you're not doing it because you should want to put your nose to the grindstone it's because you're actually enjoying it and you know that will allow you to get past the hard parts all day without a problem Jona you said that this course has done nothing for you and you've been in programming for three years do you have a programming job right now yes I mean if you do the code Academy course on Python of course you'll learn a lot of things mmm dingo yes I will teach you guys how to connect Python to different frameworks Ryan good job yes exactly if you're in Silicon Valley take advantage of the resources around there and network with people people is like the number one thing you guys can do so you know courses and everything is always gonna be awesome but getting to work with people who are maybe even at a similar level or a little bit ahead of you who can show you the way that's gonna be amazing and if you can connect with them in real life it doesn't cost you anything and it's the best way to get going like I was I started coding when one of my best friends and we just did it like for 17 hours a day and it was incredibly fun because we both were just in it you know and we both were doing it so if I was struggling I saw him struggling and it just kept me going ah Jordan to come up with ideas first think about replicating things that exist and then you'll get better at coming up with the ideas because there are two problems coming up with an idea one is obviously coming up with the idea too it's executing the idea that you come up with even if you come up with an idea how do you know that you have the skill to execute it you know is it gonna be like two months long journey and at the end you find out you couldn't execute it and you didn't know the tools so that's why work on making stuff that already exists and try to clone it and then you can actually move on so like go online and type in like Python app tutorial or there's an app I show you guys how to make it I have a youtube tutorial on it it's a texting app so you can actually type in text app Python clever program or something like that my video should come up and in that video I show you how to make an app so basically in the start you want to just follow along and go on and you know just do exactly what's happening and then go on little tangents to like what if I do this instead what if I do this instead while you're following this tutorial and once you build a few apps you'll start to get an idea of how do you make them what kind of ideas should I make them about and then later you can also know whether you have the skill set to make something or not okay but first don't just start off but I want to just create something out of the blue first Jordan focus on making something that already exists you know maybe you can start off with a Pomodoro timer you know people go on your app and they click it and the timer source for five minutes and then it makes a little noise or does something you know something simple and then go from there okay guys I'm gonna get going I'm gonna take maybe one question or something Sahil I'm planning he says I'm planning to learn see after completing the book learning Python the hard way okay sure enjoy have fun I never understand why okay so I wanted to do this as well for the longest time just do language hopping and you know now I can save you a lot of time and just tell you like if you want excel in the field language hopping isn't gonna get you there the fastest way it doesn't hurt you it does make you more knowledgeable but it doesn't get you to where you want to go in the fastest way specializing does and then after specializing you can become more of a generalist if you want to so if you have learned Python I would say stick with Python but if you learned si and you're good with Si then I would say just stick with si and keep going instead of learning like 10 different languages and becoming proficient at them because it's not about the language is about what you can do with the languages it's like you learn English and now you're ready to get a job in America and you're just like screw this I'm gonna go to Germany and then you just like go learn German and then you leave that country and go somewhere else so when you're learning a language just understand that there's a reason behind it then follow through with that and don't just get lost and bounce back and forth I use having a victim mentality and a whiny attitude will not get you far my friend so if I don't answer your question that definitely will not make me answer it you know like one of the things about successful people is you don't want to blame things on something other than yourself you know grant cardone says this and I believe this in and well as well nothing happens to you it happens because of you okay so take matters into your own hands and the more you blame external things the less control you'll have over your life itself okay so yes okay guys thank you guys so much for coming I really appreciate it and I'm gonna get going and enjoy the rest of my day honestly yeah thank you guys so much for coming I appreciate it so much it was awesome we got to play some chess I might do this again hopefully I try to provide you guys with some value but does that is it guys thank you guys so much as always I love your face off and I'll see you in the next video
