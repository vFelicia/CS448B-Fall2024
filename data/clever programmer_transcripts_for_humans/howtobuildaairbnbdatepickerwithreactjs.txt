00:00 - yeah oh nice that looks clean like a
00:02 - crisp little look to that
00:04 - uh and what we're gonna do now is
00:06 - actually go ahead and have so we've done
00:08 - that sort of
00:09 - very nice sort of look and feel to that
00:11 - part what we're gonna do is have an
00:13 - actual search button at the top so a
00:14 - search bomb which has search
00:16 - dates right so at this point to add that
00:19 - search button i'm going to go ahead
00:21 - add a another div on on top of this
00:25 - and this one we're going to call someone
00:28 - say div
00:28 - like here i'm going to give it a class
00:30 - name so i'm going to say class name
00:33 - last name of banner and this is going to
00:36 - be banner underscore underscore search
00:38 - like this and here i'm going to
00:40 - basically add in a
00:42 - button so i'm going to say a button will
00:44 - exist here
00:45 - and this button will essentially say at
00:47 - this point we're going to say just
00:48 - search
00:48 - dates right so something like this
00:50 - button search dates
00:52 - and what i want to do is i'm going to
00:53 - give it a variant of outline so i'm
00:55 - going to go ahead and do this
00:57 - oops i've forgot that we don't have
00:59 - previous i'm going to go ahead and do
01:00 - variant
01:01 - of outlined oops variant of outline like
01:06 - this
01:06 - awesome and then what i'm going to do is
01:09 - give it a class name as well so i'm
01:11 - going to go ahead and say class name
01:14 - of banner underscore underscore search
01:17 - button
01:17 - so we can start this later on so banner
01:19 - search button and with that said it
01:21 - should we should have a button on top
01:23 - and you can see it's actually
01:25 - there it's a little bit difficult to see
01:26 - but it's actually sitting there at the
01:27 - top and it says search dates at the top
01:29 - so that's very clean now we're going to
01:31 - go ahead and style that so
01:33 - whenever we give a material ui class
01:37 - a class we actually need to style it
01:38 - with the important properties so i'm
01:40 - going to go ahead
01:41 - and add the following styles to that
01:43 - button i'm going to say a background
01:44 - color of white
01:45 - i'm going to say the font weight should
01:47 - be 900 and it should have a text
01:49 - transform
01:50 - so to get rid of the uppercase text and
01:52 - we're going to give it the text itself a
01:54 - color of
01:55 - the airbnb pink so that's how we get
01:57 - that look and feel
01:59 - and then what i'm going to say is for
02:02 - the banner search so the actual div
02:04 - surrounding it i'm going to say go ahead
02:07 - and do the following so i'm going to say
02:08 - give it a top of zero so it should be
02:10 - attached to the top give it a display
02:12 - flex so actually let's go ahead and get
02:13 - rid of this one
02:14 - we can do display flex and then we're
02:17 - going to say flex direction
02:19 - column and this will actually span the
02:20 - entire width
02:22 - of the screen so display column and now
02:25 - you should see it takes up the top of
02:26 - the column so you see at the top now we
02:27 - have that search dates
02:29 - and i'm going to get rid of the home
02:30 - component text over there because that's
02:32 - just ugly right now
02:34 - so boom there we go you've got the
02:36 - search dates at the top
02:37 - right so that looks clean um but what we
02:40 - want to do now
02:41 - is have it so that when you click search
02:43 - dates we essentially change it so it
02:45 - says search dates and then hide
02:47 - search dates and hide and have to to
02:49 - demonstrate this go to the deployed
02:51 - version quasi
02:56 - yeah let's go and if you click on search
02:57 - dates
02:59 - so you see it says hide at the top and
03:01 - then it says search dates
03:02 - every time you click the button it
03:04 - changes the state right
03:06 - right so we want to get that
03:07 - functionality and then basically we
03:09 - and that nice little like nice little
03:12 - animation when i click it at the top
03:14 - yeah so that's actually already in there
03:17 - at the moment so if you go ahead and go
03:18 - to r1
03:19 - so that's the reason why we get that is
03:23 - because we're using the material ui
03:25 - button
03:26 - nice okay yeah so that's why we
03:29 - get that one right there so awesome so
03:33 - now what we're going to do is we are
03:35 - going to go to
03:37 - the um search dates and what we've got
03:41 - to do to
03:42 - get this functionality is actually add
03:43 - in a piece of state so the piece of
03:45 - state that we're going to add in so
03:46 - state is essentially just how you write
03:48 - a variable inside of react
03:50 - here we're going to have a piece of
03:51 - state which is called show search
03:54 - right and the reason why we're going to
03:55 - do this is because we want this but we
03:57 - want this variable
03:59 - to keep track of if we click that button
04:01 - or not and by default initially when we
04:03 - click it
04:03 - we're going to have false and the reason
04:05 - why we want to do this is because we're
04:07 - going to say
04:07 - if you click it so let's just say for
04:09 - example um
04:11 - whenever it says show search so if so
04:14 - show search is true
04:15 - then i basically want to render out the
04:17 - search element that you guys saw earlier
04:19 - so
04:19 - let's just say show such uh show date
04:23 - picker let's show
04:24 - show date because that's what we're
04:25 - trying to do here um
04:27 - exactly now if we go ahead and say it
04:30 - says use state is not defined we need to
04:32 - import that
04:33 - so we need to import that as such at the
04:35 - top of the file
04:36 - there we go save it and then we should
04:38 - be able to see
04:40 - now if we save that so kazi now if we
04:44 - actually change this to true you should
04:47 - be able to see
04:48 - that it should say show date picker
04:50 - awesome and if i change this to false
04:52 - it goes ahead and it hides that right so
04:56 - now we have some kind of
04:57 - functionality to it right so what we
04:59 - need to do is that button
05:01 - we're going to tie the functionality to
05:02 - that button so i'm going to say on click
05:04 - of that button whenever you click that
05:06 - button
05:06 - i'm going to shoot off an arrow function
05:08 - so it's going to shoot off a
05:10 - function and this is going to say set
05:13 - show search to whatever
05:16 - the opposite of show search currently is
05:18 - so if it's currently true
05:20 - it's going to become false if it's
05:21 - currently false it's going to become
05:22 - true
05:23 - so now to show this in practice kazi go
05:25 - ahead and hit the search date button
05:27 - or search yeah search dates
05:31 - and now you can see show date picker
05:32 - there we go so you see we have some kind
05:34 - of functionality to it now
05:36 - right and now that is gonna that
05:39 - basically sets us up for the next part
05:41 - this
05:41 - the next part is essentially building
05:43 - that beautiful date picker that you guys
05:45 - see
05:45 - in the final build which is a really
05:47 - nice all right i'll add that i'll add
05:49 - that to the top so currently we're
05:51 - working on building the date picker
05:53 - yep we're building the date picker at
05:55 - the moment
05:59 - okay i just added that to the top
06:03 - awesome so now what we're going to do
06:06 - is let's go ahead and go to
06:10 - um let's go ahead and actually go to we
06:14 - need to basically we're going to replace
06:15 - this show date picker
06:17 - with some kind of component which looks
06:19 - like this so we're going to have a
06:20 - search
06:21 - component right and this search
06:23 - component should render out to be
06:25 - essentially what we see in the final
06:26 - product so let's go ahead and create
06:28 - search.js so we should snap into that
06:30 - file
06:31 - any second now i've just created a
06:33 - search.js file
06:35 - and boom we are in it and if we do rfc
06:39 - a we should get our es7 snippet and
06:42 - let's go ahead and do our normal
06:43 - bem naming convention so we say search
06:46 - let's go ahead and create the
06:47 - appropriate
06:48 - css file so we're going to import from
06:50 - search.css
06:51 - save that create the search.css file
06:55 - nice um by the way we just broke
06:58 - 1 000 likes
07:02 - yeah thank you guys so much for that
07:05 - that is
07:06 - huge and meriban says that
07:09 - if sunny could he would shower with the
07:12 - airpods
07:13 - [Laughter]
07:19 - chris thanks so much for the five dollar
07:22 - donation
07:22 - really really appreciate you damn and he
07:25 - goes finishing up the hulu
07:27 - shadow clone you did yesterday but
07:29 - wanted to show some love
07:31 - hey that's awesome dude glad you're
07:33 - doing that
07:34 - because yeah the hulu clone was the
07:36 - hooligan was one of the funnest builds i
07:38 - didn't think it would be that fun but
07:39 - it was free if you guys haven't yeah if
07:42 - you guys haven't that's something which
07:43 - like
07:44 - just looks so nice on your portfolio
07:46 - like the hulu clone
07:47 - um it might already be deployed actually
07:49 - so you might have it
07:50 - um is it clone
07:54 - let me go ahead and see if i've got it
07:55 - so i've got the actual link here i can
07:57 - drop it tunes
07:58 - let's go ahead and do it i'll drop it in
08:00 - the code quasi so
08:01 - go ahead and check out that okay boom
08:05 - all right got it
08:09 - so this is the one you guys built
08:11 - yesterday damn it just looks
08:13 - so freaking slick like look at that
08:17 - wow insane yeah and it's completely uh
08:19 - connected to an api
08:21 - so if you go to the top and you actually
08:23 - go ahead and click because i was
08:24 - wondering i'm like how much
08:26 - accurate dummy text and data did you
08:29 - guys
08:29 - add like holy crap oh wow so if i
08:33 - actually change
08:34 - horror romance it changes yo this build
08:37 - is actually
08:38 - sick kind of regret that i wasn't like
08:40 - here for this build
08:43 - this one was pretty fun yeah like look
08:45 - at how juicy it all looks like
08:48 - even before the even the animations like
08:51 - me and frankie were saying adding those
08:52 - animations changes
08:54 - it from a website to an app yeah yeah
08:57 - true true true yeah
09:00 - that's true so this is the kind this is
09:02 - the kind of app that you guys would see
09:03 - on like a fire stick
09:04 - tv app or something you know like this
09:07 - is the kind of thing that you would be
09:08 - used to seeing
09:09 - as opposed to just a website like you so
09:12 - you could probably build this deploy
09:13 - on some kind of fire stick app and yeah
09:15 - that'd be awesome
09:19 - nice somebody asked luke says why don't
09:21 - you guys work at google
09:23 - guys we're not the guys who work at
09:24 - google we get the guys who work at
09:27 - google
09:28 - at google we're those guys
09:33 - literally those guys yeah
09:37 - yeah hopefully in the next one or two
09:39 - years like
09:41 - the probability of somebody asking like
09:43 - how'd you get a job at google
09:45 - like and somebody like saying clever
09:47 - programmer would be like
09:48 - massive like hey it was clever
09:51 - programmer
09:53 - exactly nice so with that said let's go
09:57 - ahead and build the search functionality
09:59 - so
10:00 - let's go back to search and here this is
10:02 - where
10:03 - this is going to be an intricate part of
10:04 - it hold on so are we building search or
10:06 - date picker
10:08 - yeah uh so we're building the date
10:10 - picker but this is
10:11 - it's part basically the date picker is
10:13 - the search component
10:15 - [Music]
10:16 - um
10:19 - [Laughter]
10:26 - okay all right i mean i i don't underst
10:28 - how does that work
10:30 - there this is the date picker component
10:33 - yeah
10:34 - right so are we working are we not
10:36 - working on the data picker component
10:38 - then okay okay all right i'll just let
10:39 - you keep going yeah
10:40 - oh yeah we are yeah the search component
10:42 - i'm gonna add this in here
10:44 - date picker component there we go
10:47 - all right nice so
10:51 - um now we've got the i think maybe loves
10:54 - your chair
10:57 - this is this new chair by the way i

11:07 - pillow here for me to sleep on look at
11:10 - that
11:11 - you know there's a proper stream
11:12 - streaming yeah yeah yeah and then it has
11:15 - like this
11:16 - back support thing which is hard to show
11:18 - right now but
11:19 - it's right here this thing right there
11:22 - nice so it has yeah
11:25 - because what was happening with other
11:27 - chair was i couldn't like
11:29 - i couldn't actually sit with my back on

12:24 - [Laughter]
12:28 - all right here we go
12:32 - back back to the date picker nice
12:36 - so inside the date picker we need to do
12:39 - a few things right so the thing that
12:41 - actually allows all that date picker
12:43 - magic to happen
12:44 - is um the react date range
12:48 - so i'm trying to kill the laughter
12:55 - let's open up the terminal quasi
13:00 - whoops raffle there we go raphael says

13:28 - um okay so second terminal right here
13:32 - type in here npmi icu yep npm i and then
13:36 - react date range
13:37 - so this one right here and it doesn't
13:38 - matter if you're in that folder or in
13:40 - the actual
13:40 - app folder right yeah it doesn't matter
13:43 - which one
13:44 - well cd anyways bro cause we're gonna
13:46 - forget when we're about to deploy
13:48 - oh damn wait no hold up did i do it okay

14:04 - [Music]

15:02 - let's do it dude
15:03 - i'm down i want to learn jiu-jitsu as
15:05 - well i'll be sick
15:06 - yeah so now guys we're going to import
15:10 - the date range picker so this is like a
15:12 - very handy
15:13 - npm module that i found
15:17 - and we've got we're going to import and
15:19 - now you also need to import two other
15:21 - files
15:21 - so these are css files that the guys who
15:24 - made this
15:25 - module recommend that you you bring in
15:27 - and this is because basically this is
15:30 - going to give you all that styling that
15:31 - you guys saw in the final one
15:33 - that's how the date picker looks the way
15:35 - it looks uh
15:36 - [Laughter]
15:38 - sharia sharma
15:43 - mma tutorials coming soon yeah
15:47 - just to see us doing react one day jiu
15:50 - jitsu the next
15:51 - unboxing the the day after that that's
15:55 - it nice so we've we imported the date
15:58 - range picker and to use it
16:00 - there's a few things we need to do now
16:02 - right so we need to add two pieces of
16:04 - state
16:04 - and to add those pieces of state it's
16:06 - very simple one is
16:08 - going to be for the start date and one
16:11 - is going to be for the end date
16:12 - so here we just done that so we've added
16:14 - in the start date and date
16:15 - let's go ahead and do yep that's it nice
16:17 - and for the start date we're going to
16:19 - give it a
16:19 - we're just using today's date as the
16:21 - initial value and for the end date we're
16:22 - doing today's date as well
16:24 - now once we've done that we need to
16:26 - actually add in the following
16:27 - object so here we basically say cons
16:30 - selection range
16:31 - now this stuff you don't really need to
16:32 - know why we need to read it this way the
16:34 - main thing is is
16:36 - [Laughter]
16:39 - somebody said sonny can't stop laughing
16:40 - at frankie's chair
16:43 - it does make me laugh yeah frankie
16:46 - frankie show us your chair again
16:50 - oh [ __ ] it's because oh [ __ ]
16:53 - what happened here yo who's manning the
16:56 - [ __ ] live chat
16:59 - damn guys it's because
17:03 - you're like this you're like super stern
17:05 - on your jet you know
17:08 - bro i'm not leaving this thing bro i'm
17:10 - just glued to this thing
17:12 - because i've learned my lesson my neck
17:14 - starts breaking after doing the live
17:15 - streams
17:16 - yeah it does it does
17:22 - we need to add this selection range and
17:24 - this is something that they want you to
17:26 - do if you're using this so you need to
17:27 - do section range start date end date and
17:29 - then the key
17:30 - which is just selection i'm not sure
17:31 - what the key is for in this
17:33 - situation but you need to have it so add
17:36 - that in and then we're going to create a
17:37 - function
17:38 - and this function is basically
17:40 - responsible for
17:42 - this function is responsible for when
17:44 - you basically select
17:46 - a date so here we're saying whenever you
17:47 - select a date set the start date to
17:50 - whatever range
17:50 - you selected the start date and then set
17:53 - the end date to whatever range you
17:54 - selected the end date
17:55 - now this is all done by the library
17:58 - itself so we just need to have this
18:00 - function in here
18:01 - and then they handle everything else um
18:05 - so manava ross says are you going to
18:07 - launch any react native course and he
18:08 - just dropped a
18:09 - donation thank you for that thank you um
18:12 - yeah not a react native course at this
18:14 - point but react we're covering so
18:16 - uh yeah so we'll actually be dropping
18:18 - some content on react native very soon
18:20 - nice so we have the search here and now
18:22 - what we're gonna do
18:24 - is we are actually gonna go ahead and
18:27 - add in
18:31 - the following line of code now this is
18:32 - the date range picker itself so
18:34 - date range picker ranges we basically
18:37 - pass an array
18:38 - with selection range so this one here
18:41 - and that's
18:42 - an object and then on change we pass in
18:45 - our handle select function
18:46 - okay so this is stuff that i would
18:48 - recommend you guys just follow
18:49 - you literally just follow it along you
18:51 - do it as i've written it and everything
18:53 - will just work for you as well
18:54 - inside your project so cozy let's go
18:56 - ahead and open up our localhost
19:00 - and what i'm going to do is i'm going to
19:01 - import the search so import
19:04 - import search from
19:08 - search yeah there we go
19:13 - and now what we should be able to see is
19:15 - it says use state is undefined okay so
19:17 - you state is not fine we need to go
19:18 - ahead and do this
19:19 - nice save it and now it also says i
19:23 - can't read that it says
19:24 - cannot resolve something what does that
19:27 - say cannot resolve
19:29 - um let me go ahead and pop this in
19:31 - because oh yeah i've got it
19:33 - localhost 3000. nice
19:38 - but but it says cannot resolve date fns
19:41 - oh yes
19:42 - okay so this actually requires something
19:44 - called fns so you need to do mpmi so
19:46 - let's go ahead and pull it up npm i
19:48 - date fns so it's a peer dependency
19:51 - to be honest they should have set the
19:54 - the modules up to actually do this for
19:56 - you
19:56 - but you need to do this step guys
19:58 - because you need that
19:59 - um otherwise you're going to run into
20:01 - this issue
20:03 - so that's they're bad but it should be
20:05 - fine
20:06 - so now once that installs that should
20:08 - fix this
20:09 - issue for us um
20:12 - okay there we go so now if we actually
20:15 - see it should be loading up for us
20:18 - in a second so nice so now if we click
20:21 - search dates awesome because you go
20:23 - ahead and click search days
20:32 - hey
20:34 - it's opening that thing up bro let me
20:37 - refresh
20:38 - and let's click it again boom look at
20:41 - that
20:42 - got yesterday this week damn bro that
20:45 - they built all of that out of the box i
20:47 - was like
20:48 - i don't know why but i was thinking man
20:49 - i'm like sonny must have done a lot of
20:51 - math here
20:52 - to make this stuff work like damn bro
20:56 - i should have just made up some some
20:59 - excuse me like yeah dude
21:00 - you know what to be honest i have built
21:02 - one of these manually at a previous job
21:04 - and guys it's actually a headache to
21:06 - build that so
21:07 - using a package like this is actually
21:09 - really really handy
21:11 - and this one is actually looks beautiful
21:13 - it looks it looks really nice it's a
21:16 - really really good library to use
21:17 - because there's a lot of edge cases that
21:18 - you have to account for when you're
21:19 - doing this
21:20 - guys stop repeating questions in the
21:22 - chat
21:24 - we are gonna block you
21:28 - so now what we're going to do is let's
21:30 - go ahead and
21:31 - add in um let's go ahead and add in the
21:35 - following so
21:37 - i need to actually i want to check
21:38 - something actually i wonder if we
21:40 - removed this from underneath
21:44 - here and changed it over here and then
21:46 - we tried it so let's go ahead and
21:48 - save i just want to try something
21:50 - quickly
21:51 - so now if we go ahead and try and click
21:54 - the search dates
21:56 - okay that's pretty clean but it's not as
21:58 - nice as we want all right
22:00 - anyway so going back to the point so
22:01 - let's go ahead and we've added in this
22:03 - the
22:03 - this date picker functionality so we
22:05 - need to style it to look the way that we
22:07 - want it to look
22:08 - right um so in order to get it to look
22:12 - like that
22:12 - we need to do a bunch of styling to this
22:14 - thing um and in order to do that let's
22:16 - go ahead
22:17 - and do the following so inside of search
22:19 - this target search
22:21 - let's do the following so we're going to
22:22 - say position absolute uh top 35 pixels
22:25 - left 25
22:27 - width of 100 view it so um because if
22:30 - you go ahead and click
22:31 - on the search dates yo thanks adam

23:30 - and now as we style it you'll be able to
23:32 - see everything sort of move around as we
23:34 - need it so click leave that open
23:36 - uh what we're going to do you want me to
23:37 - make it half the screen
23:39 - yeah that's too hard enough nice so now
23:42 - what i'm going to do
23:43 - is i'm going to add in boom i'm going to
23:46 - add in this
23:47 - and we're going to make it so now it's
23:49 - saying top 35
23:50 - pixels from the top left 25 pixels and
23:54 - then
23:54 - width 100 view it let's do half enough
23:56 - quasi
23:58 - for this fit all right i will
24:03 - somebody is like yo if you guys are
24:05 - making so much money why
24:06 - do these little donations impress you
24:09 - guys
24:09 - that's the humility that actually got us
24:11 - here today
24:13 - exactly yeah and that would never change
24:16 - guys like even if somebody sent us one
24:18 - like literally no like thumbs up button
24:21 - yeah hitting the thumbs up button we're
24:22 - so grateful for like
24:24 - it literally doesn't like i remember in
24:26 - the beginning we started off and it was
24:27 - like a four dollar donation and it was
24:28 - like
24:29 - it blew our mind so yeah yeah
24:32 - dude is that what mike pence's is a one
24:37 - yeah one uh pound one one cent
24:40 - one pounds i'm not just a bad joke but
24:44 - okay got it
24:46 - nice so now i was talking about this guy
24:50 - like mike pence but i'll just remove it
24:58 - so now we're going to do the we're going
25:00 - to target the h2
25:02 - uh which is so right now we don't
25:04 - actually have a h2 element so i'm going
25:05 - to go back to our search
25:07 - i'm going to add in a h2 which is
25:08 - basically going to be the number of
25:10 - guests so we're going to have that
25:11 - number of guests pop in underneath and
25:13 - then we're going to have number of
25:15 - guests
25:15 - and also we're going to have an input
25:18 - field
25:19 - for the number of guests so here we're
25:21 - going to have an input field
25:22 - for like how many guests you want to
25:24 - have and they're also going to have a
25:25 - button which says
25:26 - search airbnb right so i'm going to add
25:29 - a button
25:30 - so here i'm going to say
25:33 - i'm going to say button and i need to do
25:35 - an import for that
25:36 - and here i'm going to say search airbnb
25:38 - so let's go ahead and do that search
25:40 - airbnb
25:42 - let's go ahead and import that at the
25:43 - top so boom
25:46 - like that save the file and it says
25:49 - people icon is not defined because
25:51 - the people icon is an icon that we need
25:53 - to
25:55 - import from material ui so
25:58 - go ahead and save that hey adam tate
26:01 - just dropped another donation of two
26:03 - pounds he says thanks for taking your
26:04 - evenings up to do this
26:06 - dude you're welcome like it's insane the
26:07 - amount of value that we see you guys
26:09 - like you know
26:13 - thank you bro this guy's working his way
26:15 - up from pants to
26:16 - multiple pens thank you really
26:20 - appreciate it
26:21 - i think the first one was just a feeler
26:23 - you know
26:24 - yeah damn
26:29 - all right thank you bro nice so now
26:33 - what we're going to do is we have the
26:35 - dates popping up
26:37 - um so again if you could just click on
26:40 - the search dates button cozy
26:44 - reason why we have to click it is
26:45 - because yeah it refreshes at times so
26:47 - now you can see it says
26:49 - search at the moment oh salman fazad
26:52 - uh for faizal has dropped five canadian
26:55 - dollars nice
26:56 - so we'll be coming back to this later at
26:58 - my own pace just passing by to say thank
27:00 - you
27:01 - hold on let me pop that in let me pop
27:02 - that in okay now cover it
27:05 - so he says we'll be coming back to code
27:06 - this later on at my own pace
27:08 - just passing by to say thank you from
27:10 - everyone by the way we will be coding
27:12 - react native anytime soon
27:15 - of course dude we will be definitely
27:16 - calling native soon so stay tuned for
27:18 - that and again massive thank you for
27:20 - donating that's it
27:20 - we really appreciate that thank you bro
27:24 - awesome so let's go ahead
27:28 - and do um
27:32 - the h2 yeah so now for the h2 what i'm
27:35 - going to do is i'm going to do this
27:36 - i'm going to copy a bunch of styles in
27:38 - here and i'm going to explain through
27:39 - what they're doing so
27:40 - as soon as i hit save on this you
27:42 - actually see the style looked a bit
27:44 - different there right and the reason why
27:45 - that happened is because i don't display
27:47 - flex align
27:48 - item center which means that the um
27:51 - we now have that icon so that people
27:54 - icon
27:54 - push to the right so um we now have the
27:58 - people so
27:59 - uh cause you might need to move our face
28:01 - on the
28:02 - uh on ecam so let's move our face to
28:05 - maybe the center
28:07 - you got it because right now it's
28:09 - covering the number of guests
28:11 - um so so that should be you should go
28:14 - you guys should be obscene now on the
28:16 - drop down it says
28:17 - the number of guests and then it
28:19 - actually has that people icon and then
28:21 - we got that
28:22 - with justify content space between and
28:23 - display flex so now they're spaced apart
28:26 - and we gave it a width of five five nine
28:27 - padding of 10 pixels background color of
28:29 - white
28:30 - position absolute left of zero and top
28:32 - of 380 pixels and
28:34 - the parent we actually gave it a
28:36 - position relative so that's why
28:38 - it stays in its place so the next thing
28:41 - is i'm just going to go ahead and style
28:43 - the input so the input field
28:45 - is this one here so this one over here
28:48 - and
28:48 - this one i'm going to go ahead and do
28:50 - this so i'm going to say a width of 539
28:52 - padding at 20 pixels position absolute
28:55 - left 0 height 30 pixels
28:57 - top 420 and border of none so you guys
29:00 - can just go ahead and actually just use
29:01 - these styles and copy us
29:03 - and it will work for you um and that
29:06 - actually drops it down to the next line
29:07 - and that's actually a very nice
29:10 - um uh number sort of that you can now
29:13 - select and it will show you
29:15 - uh and the final thing that we're going
29:16 - to do or not the final thing but i
29:18 - basically now when you click the number
29:19 - of guests because you click on the the
29:21 - number two
29:22 - and you'll see that you'll see that
29:24 - nasty outline
29:25 - so uh not not that one it's just number
29:27 - of guests
29:29 - yeah so you get that nasty outline so to
29:32 - get rid of that we add in this we say
29:33 - when we focus
29:34 - make the outline with zero so you can
29:37 - see it's gone now
29:38 - oh that is but now i can't hold on
29:42 - yeah it's definitely gone yeah it's true
29:45 - it's gone but
29:46 - the date picker kind of blends into the
29:48 - page a little bit so i can't see where
29:50 - it's ending but yeah definitely it looks
29:51 - much better
29:53 - yeah so right now that's fine because we
29:56 - will be adding a button which you'll be
29:58 - able to see in a sec
29:59 - yeah so for the button to style we need
30:02 - to do the following we're going to say
30:03 - go ahead and target that button
30:05 - and do the following so position
30:08 - absolute left of zero
30:10 - but top four text transform inherit and
30:12 - that's because we don't want to be
30:13 - uppercase
30:15 - background color of the airbnb color and
30:17 - then color white and the width of 57579
30:20 - and that will give you the exact perfect
30:21 - dimensions that you guys are going to
30:22 - need
30:23 - and it should do what we want
30:26 - so there you go you've got it looking
30:28 - pretty good but when you hover over so
30:30 - because if you hover over search airbnb
30:32 - right now you'll see it kind of goes
30:34 - transparent which is nasty
30:36 - like so the the search airbnb yeah we
30:38 - see that kind of
30:40 - we don't want that we want it to
30:42 - basically invert the colors
30:44 - right so to do so to do that we add this
30:46 - in we say
30:47 - when we hover whenever we hover over it
30:51 - we want to basically do a background
30:52 - color of white and a
30:54 - color text to be that so now
30:57 - if you do it and you hover over that you
31:00 - actually see it
31:02 - so if you click uh hover over search
31:04 - airbnb
31:05 - click it nice not looks clean you want
31:08 - me to click it
31:09 - uh not yet not yet got it got it because
31:12 - i i
31:12 - will click it danny finkelstein says

31:26 - and said whoa okay nice danny
31:30 - thoroughly tonight hey

31:59 - this is just epic thank you for that we
32:02 - are at 111 dollars in super chat thank
32:05 - you so much
32:06 - we just broke a hundred dollars and uh
32:08 - you guys are awesome
32:11 - that's insane thank you so much guys
32:13 - let's keep this going
32:17 - so now what we're going to do is we are
32:19 - going to have it so now we actually have
32:21 - that date picker component looking
32:23 - beautiful it looks really nice
32:24 - but when we click search dates we want
32:26 - to change the text
32:28 - and we want to change that text so that
32:29 - it actually says hide
32:31 - right so how do we do that we go back to
32:33 - banner and here
32:35 - where we had the search dates what we
32:37 - can do here is we can actually go ahead
32:39 - and change this now
32:41 - so that it says the following we can
32:42 - actually say
32:44 - we can do this we can get rid of this
32:48 - right and inside of here what we can do
32:50 - is we can say if
32:51 - show search is true then show hold up
32:54 - text
32:55 - one second so sunny
32:58 - yeah hold up hold up hold up hold up
33:02 - how do we is there a way we can hide the
33:05 - side bar completely which one
33:08 - the status i think it's the is it the
33:11 - activity bar or the status bar
33:13 - oh you're talking about that blue stuff
33:15 - at the bottom
33:16 - on the left hand side i think that's the
33:18 - status the on the left hand side the one
33:21 - that with the file and the icons because
33:23 - the code is getting
33:24 - way too rap like it's getting wrapped up
33:27 - way too much
33:29 - um what we can do you know what i mean
33:31 - like it's looking too
33:33 - goofy now yeah i think we can do
33:36 - like what is this show sidebar
33:40 - i mean i can make it smaller but i think
33:42 - then it becomes really hard to read
33:44 - unless everybody's okay with reading
33:46 - that
33:47 - i think that's okay i think that's okay
33:50 - yeah i think that will be pretty good
33:52 - okay if you guys are okay with that
33:54 - tax just let me know otherwise i can
33:55 - change it back
33:57 - yeah and thank you so much devon
34:01 - for the five euro
34:04 - donation thank you so much brother i
34:06 - really appreciate it
34:08 - awesome that's nice thank you dude
34:11 - so now what we're going to do is we have
34:14 - the search dates
34:15 - uh added on and if you click on uh the
34:18 - search dates cause you saw in localhost
34:19 - 3000
34:21 - you'll notice it says hide so it's a
34:24 - search date and then it says hi
34:26 - yeah that's awesome so we have this whoa
34:30 - yeah okay if you make it bigger there
34:32 - you go it centers perfectly so you get a
34:34 - nice like

Cleaned transcript:

yeah oh nice that looks clean like a crisp little look to that uh and what we're gonna do now is actually go ahead and have so we've done that sort of very nice sort of look and feel to that part what we're gonna do is have an actual search button at the top so a search bomb which has search dates right so at this point to add that search button i'm going to go ahead add a another div on on top of this and this one we're going to call someone say div like here i'm going to give it a class name so i'm going to say class name last name of banner and this is going to be banner underscore underscore search like this and here i'm going to basically add in a button so i'm going to say a button will exist here and this button will essentially say at this point we're going to say just search dates right so something like this button search dates and what i want to do is i'm going to give it a variant of outline so i'm going to go ahead and do this oops i've forgot that we don't have previous i'm going to go ahead and do variant of outlined oops variant of outline like this awesome and then what i'm going to do is give it a class name as well so i'm going to go ahead and say class name of banner underscore underscore search button so we can start this later on so banner search button and with that said it should we should have a button on top and you can see it's actually there it's a little bit difficult to see but it's actually sitting there at the top and it says search dates at the top so that's very clean now we're going to go ahead and style that so whenever we give a material ui class a class we actually need to style it with the important properties so i'm going to go ahead and add the following styles to that button i'm going to say a background color of white i'm going to say the font weight should be 900 and it should have a text transform so to get rid of the uppercase text and we're going to give it the text itself a color of the airbnb pink so that's how we get that look and feel and then what i'm going to say is for the banner search so the actual div surrounding it i'm going to say go ahead and do the following so i'm going to say give it a top of zero so it should be attached to the top give it a display flex so actually let's go ahead and get rid of this one we can do display flex and then we're going to say flex direction column and this will actually span the entire width of the screen so display column and now you should see it takes up the top of the column so you see at the top now we have that search dates and i'm going to get rid of the home component text over there because that's just ugly right now so boom there we go you've got the search dates at the top right so that looks clean um but what we want to do now is have it so that when you click search dates we essentially change it so it says search dates and then hide search dates and hide and have to to demonstrate this go to the deployed version quasi yeah let's go and if you click on search dates so you see it says hide at the top and then it says search dates every time you click the button it changes the state right right so we want to get that functionality and then basically we and that nice little like nice little animation when i click it at the top yeah so that's actually already in there at the moment so if you go ahead and go to r1 so that's the reason why we get that is because we're using the material ui button nice okay yeah so that's why we get that one right there so awesome so now what we're going to do is we are going to go to the um search dates and what we've got to do to get this functionality is actually add in a piece of state so the piece of state that we're going to add in so state is essentially just how you write a variable inside of react here we're going to have a piece of state which is called show search right and the reason why we're going to do this is because we want this but we want this variable to keep track of if we click that button or not and by default initially when we click it we're going to have false and the reason why we want to do this is because we're going to say if you click it so let's just say for example um whenever it says show search so if so show search is true then i basically want to render out the search element that you guys saw earlier so let's just say show such uh show date picker let's show show date because that's what we're trying to do here um exactly now if we go ahead and say it says use state is not defined we need to import that so we need to import that as such at the top of the file there we go save it and then we should be able to see now if we save that so kazi now if we actually change this to true you should be able to see that it should say show date picker awesome and if i change this to false it goes ahead and it hides that right so now we have some kind of functionality to it right so what we need to do is that button we're going to tie the functionality to that button so i'm going to say on click of that button whenever you click that button i'm going to shoot off an arrow function so it's going to shoot off a function and this is going to say set show search to whatever the opposite of show search currently is so if it's currently true it's going to become false if it's currently false it's going to become true so now to show this in practice kazi go ahead and hit the search date button or search yeah search dates and now you can see show date picker there we go so you see we have some kind of functionality to it now right and now that is gonna that basically sets us up for the next part this the next part is essentially building that beautiful date picker that you guys see in the final build which is a really nice all right i'll add that i'll add that to the top so currently we're working on building the date picker yep we're building the date picker at the moment okay i just added that to the top awesome so now what we're going to do is let's go ahead and go to um let's go ahead and actually go to we need to basically we're going to replace this show date picker with some kind of component which looks like this so we're going to have a search component right and this search component should render out to be essentially what we see in the final product so let's go ahead and create search.js so we should snap into that file any second now i've just created a search.js file and boom we are in it and if we do rfc a we should get our es7 snippet and let's go ahead and do our normal bem naming convention so we say search let's go ahead and create the appropriate css file so we're going to import from search.css save that create the search.css file nice um by the way we just broke 1 000 likes yeah thank you guys so much for that that is huge and meriban says that if sunny could he would shower with the airpods [Laughter] chris thanks so much for the five dollar donation really really appreciate you damn and he goes finishing up the hulu shadow clone you did yesterday but wanted to show some love hey that's awesome dude glad you're doing that because yeah the hulu clone was the hooligan was one of the funnest builds i didn't think it would be that fun but it was free if you guys haven't yeah if you guys haven't that's something which like just looks so nice on your portfolio like the hulu clone um it might already be deployed actually so you might have it um is it clone let me go ahead and see if i've got it so i've got the actual link here i can drop it tunes let's go ahead and do it i'll drop it in the code quasi so go ahead and check out that okay boom all right got it so this is the one you guys built yesterday damn it just looks so freaking slick like look at that wow insane yeah and it's completely uh connected to an api so if you go to the top and you actually go ahead and click because i was wondering i'm like how much accurate dummy text and data did you guys add like holy crap oh wow so if i actually change horror romance it changes yo this build is actually sick kind of regret that i wasn't like here for this build this one was pretty fun yeah like look at how juicy it all looks like even before the even the animations like me and frankie were saying adding those animations changes it from a website to an app yeah yeah true true true yeah that's true so this is the kind this is the kind of app that you guys would see on like a fire stick tv app or something you know like this is the kind of thing that you would be used to seeing as opposed to just a website like you so you could probably build this deploy on some kind of fire stick app and yeah that'd be awesome nice somebody asked luke says why don't you guys work at google guys we're not the guys who work at google we get the guys who work at google at google we're those guys literally those guys yeah yeah hopefully in the next one or two years like the probability of somebody asking like how'd you get a job at google like and somebody like saying clever programmer would be like massive like hey it was clever programmer exactly nice so with that said let's go ahead and build the search functionality so let's go back to search and here this is where this is going to be an intricate part of it hold on so are we building search or date picker yeah uh so we're building the date picker but this is it's part basically the date picker is the search component um [Laughter] okay all right i mean i i don't underst how does that work there this is the date picker component yeah right so are we working are we not working on the data picker component then okay okay all right i'll just let you keep going yeah oh yeah we are yeah the search component i'm gonna add this in here date picker component there we go all right nice so um now we've got the i think maybe loves your chair this is this new chair by the way i swear i think i've seen this in the previous ones oh yeah thank you guys by the way this is a brand new chair i just got actually it has a nice little pillow here for me to sleep on look at that you know there's a proper stream streaming yeah yeah yeah and then it has like this back support thing which is hard to show right now but it's right here this thing right there nice so it has yeah because what was happening with other chair was i couldn't like i couldn't actually sit with my back on it so that was the problem i'm laughing because meanwhile frankie's gone like yeah frankie's chair no frankie has a pretty cool chair right this is a mess he has like a wooden chair [Laughter] yeah you know hey man when you live stream you know you got you need all this i just walk around like this now i don't even let my neck go from here i try to keep my neck glued [Laughter] all right here we go back back to the date picker nice so inside the date picker we need to do a few things right so the thing that actually allows all that date picker magic to happen is um the react date range so i'm trying to kill the laughter let's open up the terminal quasi whoops raffle there we go raphael says honey is that your amg that is my amg thank you dude hey that guy's name is but his name is mine what the hell is going on here i'm rafi oh yeah nice frank goes frankie has he friend goes frankie has the junior dev chair because he has a senior dev chair yeah let's go to the second terminal um okay so second terminal right here type in here npmi icu yep npm i and then react date range so this one right here and it doesn't matter if you're in that folder or in the actual app folder right yeah it doesn't matter which one well cd anyways bro cause we're gonna forget when we're about to deploy oh damn wait no hold up did i do it okay good shot dude good job yeah make sure you're in the right one because otherwise that will be an issue uh it's being super slow it's being super slow right now make sure you're in the right photo guys because that will i don't know my terminals being so slow who retracted that message damn dude why are they that's funny dude somebody's message just got retracted they're like i don't know what he said but he's like am i the only one who thinks sunny is looking fat today i don't know why people think that you're more jacked than everybody here i'm the one who's actually fat i gotta work on my my belly you know gotta work on it i'm trying to box every day mma again hey let's go bro yeah i'm doing krav maga which is like an israeli style of mma yeah damn yeah it'd be dope man yeah yeah i'll show you jiujitsu you can show me some krav maga let's do it dude i'm down i want to learn jiujitsu as well i'll be sick yeah so now guys we're going to import the date range picker so this is like a very handy npm module that i found and we've got we're going to import and now you also need to import two other files so these are css files that the guys who made this module recommend that you you bring in and this is because basically this is going to give you all that styling that you guys saw in the final one that's how the date picker looks the way it looks uh [Laughter] sharia sharma mma tutorials coming soon yeah just to see us doing react one day jiu jitsu the next unboxing the the day after that that's it nice so we've we imported the date range picker and to use it there's a few things we need to do now right so we need to add two pieces of state and to add those pieces of state it's very simple one is going to be for the start date and one is going to be for the end date so here we just done that so we've added in the start date and date let's go ahead and do yep that's it nice and for the start date we're going to give it a we're just using today's date as the initial value and for the end date we're doing today's date as well now once we've done that we need to actually add in the following object so here we basically say cons selection range now this stuff you don't really need to know why we need to read it this way the main thing is is [Laughter] somebody said sonny can't stop laughing at frankie's chair it does make me laugh yeah frankie frankie show us your chair again oh [ __ ] it's because oh [ __ ] what happened here yo who's manning the [ __ ] live chat damn guys it's because you're like this you're like super stern on your jet you know bro i'm not leaving this thing bro i'm just glued to this thing because i've learned my lesson my neck starts breaking after doing the live streams yeah it does it does we need to add this selection range and this is something that they want you to do if you're using this so you need to do section range start date end date and then the key which is just selection i'm not sure what the key is for in this situation but you need to have it so add that in and then we're going to create a function and this function is basically responsible for this function is responsible for when you basically select a date so here we're saying whenever you select a date set the start date to whatever range you selected the start date and then set the end date to whatever range you selected the end date now this is all done by the library itself so we just need to have this function in here and then they handle everything else um so manava ross says are you going to launch any react native course and he just dropped a donation thank you for that thank you um yeah not a react native course at this point but react we're covering so uh yeah so we'll actually be dropping some content on react native very soon nice so we have the search here and now what we're gonna do is we are actually gonna go ahead and add in the following line of code now this is the date range picker itself so date range picker ranges we basically pass an array with selection range so this one here and that's an object and then on change we pass in our handle select function okay so this is stuff that i would recommend you guys just follow you literally just follow it along you do it as i've written it and everything will just work for you as well inside your project so cozy let's go ahead and open up our localhost and what i'm going to do is i'm going to import the search so import import search from search yeah there we go and now what we should be able to see is it says use state is undefined okay so you state is not fine we need to go ahead and do this nice save it and now it also says i can't read that it says cannot resolve something what does that say cannot resolve um let me go ahead and pop this in because oh yeah i've got it localhost 3000. nice but but it says cannot resolve date fns oh yes okay so this actually requires something called fns so you need to do mpmi so let's go ahead and pull it up npm i date fns so it's a peer dependency to be honest they should have set the the modules up to actually do this for you but you need to do this step guys because you need that um otherwise you're going to run into this issue so that's they're bad but it should be fine so now once that installs that should fix this issue for us um okay there we go so now if we actually see it should be loading up for us in a second so nice so now if we click search dates awesome because you go ahead and click search days hey it's opening that thing up bro let me refresh and let's click it again boom look at that got yesterday this week damn bro that they built all of that out of the box i was like i don't know why but i was thinking man i'm like sonny must have done a lot of math here to make this stuff work like damn bro i should have just made up some some excuse me like yeah dude you know what to be honest i have built one of these manually at a previous job and guys it's actually a headache to build that so using a package like this is actually really really handy and this one is actually looks beautiful it looks it looks really nice it's a really really good library to use because there's a lot of edge cases that you have to account for when you're doing this guys stop repeating questions in the chat we are gonna block you so now what we're going to do is let's go ahead and add in um let's go ahead and add in the following so i need to actually i want to check something actually i wonder if we removed this from underneath here and changed it over here and then we tried it so let's go ahead and save i just want to try something quickly so now if we go ahead and try and click the search dates okay that's pretty clean but it's not as nice as we want all right anyway so going back to the point so let's go ahead and we've added in this the this date picker functionality so we need to style it to look the way that we want it to look right um so in order to get it to look like that we need to do a bunch of styling to this thing um and in order to do that let's go ahead and do the following so inside of search this target search let's do the following so we're going to say position absolute uh top 35 pixels left 25 width of 100 view it so um because if you go ahead and click on the search dates yo thanks adam whoa what happened to my voice there yo thanks adam for the 79 cent uh pound is it 79 euro what is this that's a pence like pounds this is [Laughter] wait are you serious it's like pennies yeah 79 pennies 79 pence it's like it's like you know pounds and pence and dollars and cents oh [ __ ] bro i did not know this thank you for the 79 pence really appreciate it thank you dude so here we're going to do so click on search dates all right boom clicked yeah and now as we style it you'll be able to see everything sort of move around as we need it so click leave that open uh what we're going to do you want me to make it half the screen yeah that's too hard enough nice so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to add in boom i'm going to add in this and we're going to make it so now it's saying top 35 pixels from the top left 25 pixels and then width 100 view it let's do half enough quasi for this fit all right i will somebody is like yo if you guys are making so much money why do these little donations impress you guys that's the humility that actually got us here today exactly yeah and that would never change guys like even if somebody sent us one like literally no like thumbs up button yeah hitting the thumbs up button we're so grateful for like it literally doesn't like i remember in the beginning we started off and it was like a four dollar donation and it was like it blew our mind so yeah yeah dude is that what mike pence's is a one yeah one uh pound one one cent one pounds i'm not just a bad joke but okay got it nice so now i was talking about this guy like mike pence but i'll just remove it so now we're going to do the we're going to target the h2 uh which is so right now we don't actually have a h2 element so i'm going to go back to our search i'm going to add in a h2 which is basically going to be the number of guests so we're going to have that number of guests pop in underneath and then we're going to have number of guests and also we're going to have an input field for the number of guests so here we're going to have an input field for like how many guests you want to have and they're also going to have a button which says search airbnb right so i'm going to add a button so here i'm going to say i'm going to say button and i need to do an import for that and here i'm going to say search airbnb so let's go ahead and do that search airbnb let's go ahead and import that at the top so boom like that save the file and it says people icon is not defined because the people icon is an icon that we need to import from material ui so go ahead and save that hey adam tate just dropped another donation of two pounds he says thanks for taking your evenings up to do this dude you're welcome like it's insane the amount of value that we see you guys like you know thank you bro this guy's working his way up from pants to multiple pens thank you really appreciate it i think the first one was just a feeler you know yeah damn all right thank you bro nice so now what we're going to do is we have the dates popping up um so again if you could just click on the search dates button cozy reason why we have to click it is because yeah it refreshes at times so now you can see it says search at the moment oh salman fazad uh for faizal has dropped five canadian dollars nice so we'll be coming back to this later at my own pace just passing by to say thank you hold on let me pop that in let me pop that in okay now cover it so he says we'll be coming back to code this later on at my own pace just passing by to say thank you from everyone by the way we will be coding react native anytime soon of course dude we will be definitely calling native soon so stay tuned for that and again massive thank you for donating that's it we really appreciate that thank you bro awesome so let's go ahead and do um the h2 yeah so now for the h2 what i'm going to do is i'm going to do this i'm going to copy a bunch of styles in here and i'm going to explain through what they're doing so as soon as i hit save on this you actually see the style looked a bit different there right and the reason why that happened is because i don't display flex align item center which means that the um we now have that icon so that people icon push to the right so um we now have the people so uh cause you might need to move our face on the uh on ecam so let's move our face to maybe the center you got it because right now it's covering the number of guests um so so that should be you should go you guys should be obscene now on the drop down it says the number of guests and then it actually has that people icon and then we got that with justify content space between and display flex so now they're spaced apart and we gave it a width of five five nine padding of 10 pixels background color of white position absolute left of zero and top of 380 pixels and the parent we actually gave it a position relative so that's why it stays in its place so the next thing is i'm just going to go ahead and style the input so the input field is this one here so this one over here and this one i'm going to go ahead and do this so i'm going to say a width of 539 padding at 20 pixels position absolute left 0 height 30 pixels top 420 and border of none so you guys can just go ahead and actually just use these styles and copy us and it will work for you um and that actually drops it down to the next line and that's actually a very nice um uh number sort of that you can now select and it will show you uh and the final thing that we're going to do or not the final thing but i basically now when you click the number of guests because you click on the the number two and you'll see that you'll see that nasty outline so uh not not that one it's just number of guests yeah so you get that nasty outline so to get rid of that we add in this we say when we focus make the outline with zero so you can see it's gone now oh that is but now i can't hold on yeah it's definitely gone yeah it's true it's gone but the date picker kind of blends into the page a little bit so i can't see where it's ending but yeah definitely it looks much better yeah so right now that's fine because we will be adding a button which you'll be able to see in a sec yeah so for the button to style we need to do the following we're going to say go ahead and target that button and do the following so position absolute left of zero but top four text transform inherit and that's because we don't want to be uppercase background color of the airbnb color and then color white and the width of 57579 and that will give you the exact perfect dimensions that you guys are going to need and it should do what we want so there you go you've got it looking pretty good but when you hover over so because if you hover over search airbnb right now you'll see it kind of goes transparent which is nasty like so the the search airbnb yeah we see that kind of we don't want that we want it to basically invert the colors right so to do so to do that we add this in we say when we hover whenever we hover over it we want to basically do a background color of white and a color text to be that so now if you do it and you hover over that you actually see it so if you click uh hover over search airbnb click it nice not looks clean you want me to click it uh not yet not yet got it got it because i i will click it danny finkelstein says keep up the awesome work guys i will watch this oh snap let me find out damn thank you bro for that five dollar donation and said whoa okay nice danny thoroughly tonight hey let's go emotional code coming in with the heavy hidden 20 donation thank you so much and all he said was that was his message to us thank you whenever i see like a 20 donation or something i just picture somebody coming in swinging everything's frank seriously yeah this is just epic thank you for that we are at 111 dollars in super chat thank you so much we just broke a hundred dollars and uh you guys are awesome that's insane thank you so much guys let's keep this going so now what we're going to do is we are going to have it so now we actually have that date picker component looking beautiful it looks really nice but when we click search dates we want to change the text and we want to change that text so that it actually says hide right so how do we do that we go back to banner and here where we had the search dates what we can do here is we can actually go ahead and change this now so that it says the following we can actually say we can do this we can get rid of this right and inside of here what we can do is we can say if show search is true then show hold up text one second so sunny yeah hold up hold up hold up hold up how do we is there a way we can hide the side bar completely which one the status i think it's the is it the activity bar or the status bar oh you're talking about that blue stuff at the bottom on the left hand side i think that's the status the on the left hand side the one that with the file and the icons because the code is getting way too rap like it's getting wrapped up way too much um what we can do you know what i mean like it's looking too goofy now yeah i think we can do like what is this show sidebar i mean i can make it smaller but i think then it becomes really hard to read unless everybody's okay with reading that i think that's okay i think that's okay yeah i think that will be pretty good okay if you guys are okay with that tax just let me know otherwise i can change it back yeah and thank you so much devon for the five euro donation thank you so much brother i really appreciate it awesome that's nice thank you dude so now what we're going to do is we have the search dates uh added on and if you click on uh the search dates cause you saw in localhost 3000 you'll notice it says hide so it's a search date and then it says hi yeah that's awesome so we have this whoa yeah okay if you make it bigger there you go it centers perfectly so you get a nice like little look to it awesome so now what we're going to do is we're going to make it so that we are actually going no actually at this point i think what we need to do is add in the cards right so the cards are what we see underneath those like those really nice looking cards um and what we need to do is we go to home and essentially what we're going to do inside of home another epic donation by path re sfl four dollar donation thank you so much my man really appreciate you and guys if like pastor you've also been enjoying this video so far what can they do sunny they can smash the thumbs up button guys
