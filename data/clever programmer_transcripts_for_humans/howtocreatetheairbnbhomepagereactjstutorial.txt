00:00 - talking about so i'll just search from
00:01 - 26th to 30th
00:03 - and do this and this is what i got by
00:05 - the way super responsive so it looks
00:07 - amazing
00:08 - and when you say search page you're
00:10 - really referring to this page right
00:13 - exactly yeah exactly what i'm referring
00:16 - to
00:16 - whoa 10 canadian dollars
00:20 - thank you thank you so much that is
00:23 - awesome
00:23 - and we just broke 700 viewers with a 10
00:27 - donation guys you're the best thank you
00:29 - so much and smash that like button let's
00:31 - keep this rocking and rolling
00:34 - nice let's go guys so the first thing
00:36 - we're going to do is build a home.js
00:38 - component so
00:39 - because if you're going to go ahead and
00:41 - create the first file and then what we
00:42 - can do is i can create it after that
00:44 - but sure thing uh just to show them so
00:46 - what do you home.js
00:48 - exactly
00:53 - nice and once we have home.js we're
00:55 - going to use our nice little trick
00:56 - called rfce
00:58 - and rfce is a is a really handy
01:01 - extension that we it's called es7
01:03 - react snippets and to get that it's very
01:06 - simple you just go to
01:07 - the vs code extensions type in es7
01:09 - snippets and it will come up
01:10 - and that will give you that rfce
01:12 - functionality which is nice
01:14 - so at this point what we're going to do
01:16 - is we are going to actually go ahead and
01:18 - give this a class name
01:20 - of home so we give this a class name of
01:23 - home just like this and we are going to
01:26 - go ahead and import the appropriate css
01:29 - file so we're going to say
01:30 - import home.css like this right
01:34 - and obviously with that said we're going
01:35 - to have to go ahead and create the css
01:37 - file so i'm going to go ahead and create
01:38 - home.css
01:40 - and we should be popped in right here so
01:43 - uh i think you have to follow me cozzy
01:46 - so let's go ahead and
01:47 - re-follow me there we go so now you guys
01:49 - can see i'm inside of home.css
01:51 - and we've imported it at the top here
01:53 - and that will allow us guys to do a few
01:55 - things that allow us to actually write
01:56 - css
01:57 - which only belongs to the home folder a
02:00 - home component sorry
02:01 - so with that what we're going to do now
02:03 - is we're going to pull this on to you so
02:04 - let's just
02:05 - prove that this is the home we're going
02:06 - to say h1 um oh no my snippets don't
02:09 - seem to work that's fine we can do h1
02:11 - and here i'm going to say uh home
02:15 - component like this right save this file
02:18 - and i'm going to go back to your app and
02:20 - here we're actually going to pull it in
02:21 - the home component so i'm going to say
02:22 - home
02:23 - like so and what we can do is we need to
02:25 - import the home component so i'm going
02:27 - to say import
02:28 - home from home like this right and save
02:32 - the file
02:33 - and what that will go ahead and do is it
02:35 - should now we should now see
02:37 - on the we should now see on the
02:42 - uh on the right side so let's go ahead
02:44 - and give me one second my itunes is
02:46 - going nuts
02:47 - so just shutting out my itunes and now
02:50 - you guys should be actually good to go
02:52 - oh and i just realized i got my
02:55 - phone as a thing so
02:58 - i'm gonna actually probably use that at
03:01 - some point but for now let's keep going
03:04 - nice so uh let's go ahead and pull up
03:06 - localhost on the right
03:09 - okay so we're gonna do that so we got
03:12 - localhost and the actual final build
03:14 - right here so everybody can
03:16 - see it nice and are we sharing
03:20 - the screen yeah nice awesome so now
03:22 - we've got uh you can see it says home
03:24 - component right
03:25 - so what i'm going to go ahead and do
03:26 - just prove this we're going to get rid
03:27 - of the h1
03:28 - over here and now you should be able to
03:30 - just see home component right so it
03:32 - should be super clean
03:33 - we might need to refresh localhost uh
03:35 - because it doesn't seem to be coming up
03:37 - somebody says sunny check your voice is
03:39 - too low so let me go ahead and turn the
03:41 - gain up a little bit for you guys i'll
03:42 - turn you up a little
03:43 - don't turn your gain up your audio is
03:45 - pretty awesome i'll turn you up here
03:46 - more
03:47 - your audio today is like really clean
03:50 - okay
03:50 - awesome now you're better nice
03:53 - so now what we're going to do is we are
03:55 - actually going to go ahead and build out
03:57 - the home component so
03:58 - the first thing we want to build inside
04:00 - the home component is
04:02 - um the actual before we do that so we
04:05 - actually added the home component
04:06 - but we actually want to always show so
04:08 - think of it this way the header
04:09 - component is actually going to live in
04:11 - both the home and the
04:13 - um the search page right so it's going
04:15 - to exist in both of these things so what
04:16 - we can do
04:17 - is we just built the home component but
04:19 - we're actually going to go ahead and
04:20 - build the header component
04:21 - and this is always going to show so
04:23 - let's go ahead and add this in
04:24 - right here right here so yeah what we
04:26 - need to do is create header.js
04:28 - so header.js and we should snap into
04:31 - that file in a second
04:33 - uh let's go in it's just loading so
04:36 - we're now inside the header.json we'll
04:37 - do rfce
04:39 - and we're inside and i'm going to do
04:40 - class name equals header
04:43 - like so and we're going to do import
04:47 - header.css and then i'm going to go
04:50 - ahead and do
04:51 - header.css so we've created a header.css
04:54 - file as well
04:54 - and you should see me snap in any second
04:58 - now there we go so we're inside and
05:01 - inside of the header file
05:02 - let's go ahead and start sort of
05:04 - drafting out what it's going to look
05:06 - like so
05:06 - the header file has an image tag so i've
05:09 - actually gone ahead and grabbed an image
05:10 - and this is just an image of
05:12 - the um the uh airbnb logo
05:16 - so let's go ahead and pop this in here
05:19 - and what we're going to do is you can
05:21 - see i've given it a class name of header
05:22 - underscore underscore icon so this is
05:24 - bem this is header component and it's
05:26 - the icon element so that's why we've
05:28 - done this
05:29 - and now we should actually go ahead and
05:30 - see that if we
05:32 - okay so it's freaking out because we
05:33 - haven't imported it so we need to go
05:35 - ahead and import it here so we can say
05:36 - header
05:37 - like this save the file and we should
05:40 - now see a massive
05:41 - airbnb logo right so obviously we don't
05:44 - want it to be that big
05:45 - it looks a bit ugly when we have it like
05:46 - that so
05:48 - so how do we get that to look a bit
05:49 - smaller right so we go to header.css
05:52 - and we basically are going to target the
05:53 - header icon so we're going to target the
05:55 - header icon
05:56 - and i'm going to say give it an object
05:58 - fit contain so this is going to keep the
06:00 - aspect ratio so it doesn't stretch
06:02 - i'm going to say the height is 100
06:03 - pixels so now you can see it's a very
06:05 - small size
06:06 - and then we're going to go ahead and
06:07 - give it margin left of 80 pixels
06:10 - so that should push it a little bit from
06:12 - the side so let's go ahead and decrease
06:13 - this a little bit for now so let's just
06:14 - say 20 pixels
06:16 - to make it a little bit subtle and we
06:18 - have the image tag up and running so
06:19 - that's
06:20 - all handy and that's done now we're
06:21 - going to create a div
06:23 - for the center stuff so that that search
06:26 - input field that you see
06:27 - and the header right so let's go ahead
06:29 - and pull out the deployed version quasi
06:34 - so this is a deployed version yep
06:38 - so this is the deployed version and you
06:39 - can see it in the middle of that
06:40 - deployed version so that's actually
06:41 - going to give it half and half
06:43 - uh so because right now it's still quite
06:46 - stretched
06:47 - there we go so you can see in the middle
06:49 - of the the top bar we have that search
06:51 - input field so we're going to go ahead
06:52 - and build that first
06:53 - and then we're going to add a header
06:55 - right section which is which has those
06:56 - uh icons that you see on the right
06:58 - so hold on so in the in the header
07:02 - this is going to be one so i'm just
07:04 - imagining this this is one container
07:07 - that will just keep the logo and that
07:09 - one container has only
07:10 - one child yeah so this is really good by
07:13 - the way guys because my
07:15 - css skills suck so it's good because if
07:18 - you're a beginner in css you'll pick it
07:20 - up this way too
07:20 - i imagine this is one container with
07:25 - two children one is the search input and
07:27 - one is the search icon
07:29 - exactly nice okay dope
07:33 - and then we got another one here and
07:35 - this has four
07:37 - one container with four children text
07:40 - logo
07:40 - icon icon icon yep
07:44 - exactly and the middle container we're
07:46 - going to apply flex 1 to it so it's
07:48 - actually going to span
07:49 - all of that gap that you see in the
07:51 - middle so this is going to apply flex 1
07:53 - and so hold on let me get this straight
07:55 - so this container here is actually
07:59 - really like this right yes
08:02 - exactly nice
08:06 - and that happens when you do when you do
08:08 - flex one
08:10 - exactly so it's giving that the
08:12 - importance and then the
08:14 - the ones on the right and left are only
08:16 - taking up as much space as they need
08:20 - exactly that now another question for
08:22 - you sunny how do they know to be
08:23 - centered how does airbnb
08:25 - logo know to be kind of centered you
08:29 - know what i mean like why isn't it left
08:30 - aligned
08:32 - so what we do is we say that the um
08:35 - header so we say that entire container
08:37 - should be display flex
08:39 - which will pop everything into a row and
08:41 - then what we say is align item center
08:43 - and that will align
08:44 - everything centrally ah so this is
08:47 - because of
08:47 - align items uh center something like
08:50 - that
08:51 - yep exactly dope okay dude this is
08:54 - actually a really cool way for me to
08:55 - learn
08:57 - yeah it's nice okay and when you do a
09:00 - line item center it will center
09:01 - every single one of these items in the
09:03 - entire header we're applying a line item
09:05 - center
09:06 - to the header yeah so the actual
09:10 - um we're applying it to the direct
09:13 - children of the parents so that they had
09:14 - a parent so we should make sense when we
09:16 - do it
09:17 - but what will happen is for that middle
09:19 - one for example
09:20 - that will have its own display flex and
09:22 - then that will have to have its own
09:24 - align item center got it so every single
09:26 - container has to behave
09:28 - you have to give the rules to that
09:29 - container so um yeah
09:31 - we'll be able to show it out but that's
09:32 - a really good example of a line item
09:33 - center
09:34 - beautiful okay okay let's keep going
09:37 - nice so with that said what we're going
09:39 - to do now is go over to here and we're
09:41 - going to create a div
09:42 - so i'm going to go ahead and do div um
09:44 - so let's make a div
09:46 - and this div oh man why is he snipping
09:49 - this no i'm going to say div
09:50 - class name equals and then here i'm
09:53 - going to do header center
09:55 - right so this will be header center and
09:56 - it's being a bit laggy so this is
09:58 - actually going to go ahead and do this
10:00 - so header center and here we're going to
10:03 - have two things we're going to have an
10:04 - input typed
10:05 - as text so here's going to have an input
10:08 - type as text
10:08 - and a search icon now it's going to
10:11 - freak out because this search icon i
10:12 - mean where are we getting this from
10:14 - right so in order to get the search icon
10:16 - we're going to have to pull in material
10:18 - ui so let's go ahead and actually do
10:20 - that at this point so kazi let's head
10:21 - over to materialui.com and show them how
10:23 - to install
10:24 - material ui core and material ui icons
10:27 - yep so you guys
10:28 - make sure when you're at material ui
10:30 - grab this come back to your command line
10:33 - i'm gonna just open up a new one and
10:35 - then install this how you install core
10:37 - now i'm gonna go here type in icons
10:40 - and um in the mean and then also
10:44 - i think install core really fast damn
10:46 - and then over here
10:48 - choose icons because my download is what
10:50 - 900
10:51 - 900 download speed actually right now
10:53 - 900 megabits nice
10:55 - uh so make sure you also install icons
10:58 - you'll need this
10:59 - on this page make sure you click here
11:01 - which says search the full list of icons
11:04 - and yeah until somebody finds a better
11:06 - way to do that
11:08 - and then go in here here are all your
11:10 - icons so for example
11:12 - when you guys are looking at these icons
11:16 - here right
11:18 - um whoops there we go so sunny has this
11:21 - avatar icon at the top right
11:23 - i i can probably did you actually pick
11:26 - it from here uh
11:27 - no so the avatar is actually a component
11:29 - because you can pause something but
11:30 - let's look at the globe
11:31 - for example okay let's type in globe
11:34 - okay there we go
11:35 - yep so that's coming from right there
11:38 - dope
11:38 - and then what about that drop drop arrow
11:42 - drop arrow that's that's actually if you
11:44 - type in
11:45 - uh i think it's if you type in down down
11:47 - or something
11:48 - yeah there we go another is that one
11:50 - that one expand more
11:52 - it's expanding yeah that's it right
11:55 - there
11:56 - and then yeah i mean everything else oh
11:58 - the search is
11:59 - i mean obvious so then what sunny would
12:01 - do is once he finds search right
12:03 - here we got search we match it up to
12:05 - that one dope
12:07 - now click here this will give you the
12:09 - actual code you can copy it paste it
12:10 - into your app and you're good to go
12:13 - exactly and then that's how when you see
12:15 - me using snippets like search icon
12:17 - language i can expand more icon
12:19 - that's where we're getting them from
12:20 - right so if you do get confused at any
12:22 - point you can be sure to check out
12:23 - material ui
12:24 - the icon search tool all right i'm gonna
12:26 - give you access i'm gonna give you read
12:28 - and write access to both
12:29 - terminals as well awesome
12:33 - nice so with that said guys this search
12:35 - icon is freaking out right now because
12:37 - it doesn't know where to pull it from so
12:38 - let's go to the top of the file
12:40 - import the search icon like that and
12:42 - that will actually go ahead and
12:44 - it should save the file and we should
12:46 - have the search icon so you can see now
12:48 - everything by default is display blocks
12:50 - which means it stacks up on top of each
12:52 - other
12:52 - we don't actually want that behavior
12:54 - right so in order to get rid of that
12:55 - what we can do is we can go here and we
12:56 - can say
12:57 - header and we can say display flex so if
13:00 - i do this display flex
13:02 - check out what happens as soon as we hit
13:03 - save everything goes into a row so you
13:05 - can now see that the airbnb
13:07 - and the top has gone into a row let's go
13:09 - ahead and remove that home component
13:11 - let's just comment that out for now so
13:13 - it gets a bit confusing there we go
13:15 - so inside of the header now we've got
13:16 - the search icon and we've got an input
13:18 - field text
13:19 - input field yeah so what we're going to
13:21 - do now is also
13:22 - remember we said you have to treat every
13:24 - single container with its own rules
13:26 - so in order to do that we can target the
13:28 - header center say display flex
13:30 - and look what happens when i do this
13:31 - guys so if i say display flex align
13:33 - item center like this look how the
13:38 - uh search icon is now central center
13:41 - with the input field so that's really
13:42 - clean and that's the way that you do
13:44 - that
13:45 - all right now what i'm going to also do
13:47 - is go ahead and add a the right section
13:49 - so the right section i'm going to go
13:51 - ahead and
13:51 - do a div and this div is going to have a
13:54 - class name of let's go ahead and say
13:57 - header
13:57 - underscore right there we go and here
14:00 - i'm going to go ahead and add in a few
14:02 - things it's going to have a p tag
14:03 - so this p tag is going to say become
14:06 - a host because that's what they have on
14:08 - airbnb and
14:10 - for those of you who don't actually know
14:11 - what airbnb is it's a place where you
14:12 - can pretty much rent out a room
14:14 - it's like a hotels of booking website um
14:17 - so yeah
14:17 - so that's where you can become a host as
14:19 - well so we're gonna import the two icons
14:21 - at the top so you've got language icon
14:23 - expand more icon
14:24 - and also this is not an icon but it's
14:27 - it's a component called avatar
14:29 - now that's how we achieve that sort of
14:31 - circular profile image
14:33 - a very very powerful component you can
14:35 - actually pass it a source we use it in a
14:36 - lot of other builds so be sure to check
14:38 - that out
14:38 - but what we're going to do is we're
14:39 - going to go ahead and pop in those three
14:41 - icons
14:41 - here like so so i'm going to go ahead
14:44 - and do this
14:45 - and now we should see those things pop
14:47 - in and now you can see in the header
14:48 - right container
14:49 - you as you guessed it it's display block
14:51 - which means they stack up on top of each
14:53 - other by default
14:54 - we again don't want this behavior so
14:56 - what we can do is we can say header
14:57 - right
14:58 - we can go ahead and write and then what
15:00 - we can do is we can say uh header right
15:02 - display
15:03 - flex display flex like this
15:06 - right now if i go ahead and do this we
15:09 - can go ahead and save it and you should
15:10 - be able to see everything goes into a
15:12 - into its own line right now if again
15:14 - let's stick with our rule let's do a
15:16 - line item center
15:17 - and we will be able to see again that
15:19 - everything goes
15:20 - center central with each other which is
15:22 - really nice and it's a really good way
15:24 - of doing this
15:25 - now for the header what we're going to
15:26 - do is we're going to space out those
15:27 - components
15:28 - components as much as they can go so
15:30 - we're going to say justify content space
15:32 - between and that will actually push the
15:33 - components apart
15:35 - as far as they can go from each other
15:37 - and then for the central
15:39 - element remember we said that we want
15:40 - that center one to take up as much room
15:42 - as it can
15:42 - so we're gonna go ahead and give that a
15:43 - flex one rule
15:45 - and that will do that and you can't
15:47 - actually see what this is doing unless
15:49 - we actually make it a little bit bigger
15:50 - but you need to trust at this point so
15:52 - cause let's go ahead and make it a
15:53 - little bit bigger
15:54 - now you can see the input field is
15:57 - actually taking up
15:58 - the majority of that room but it doesn't
16:00 - look like it right now right
16:02 - so it actually doesn't look like it and
16:04 - the way we fix this right now
16:06 - is we're going to add a few things in
16:08 - and
16:09 - in order to do that uh what we need to
16:13 - do at this point is firstly we need to
16:15 - go ahead and do
16:16 - the following so we're going to say
16:17 - align items center which we've done
16:20 - so let's go ahead and do that first
16:21 - align item center at the top
16:24 - uh william cruz again with the um
16:27 - five i think that's uh what was that one
16:30 - he always says it every time i can't
16:31 - remember but thank you so much for that
16:33 - donation massively
16:38 - awesome i always actually i call it the
16:40 - chief keef donation but i
16:42 - forget what the chf man every time
16:45 - swiss franc how in the world does chf
16:49 - stand for
16:50 - swiss franc bro
16:53 - but thank you so much that is huge
16:56 - yeah i always get lost to that one i
16:58 - wish it had a better acronym like
17:00 - sf swiss franc that would be so much
17:03 - easier
17:04 - but thank you brother i appreciate it
17:07 - absolutely appreciate that
17:09 - so nice so now what we're gonna do is
17:11 - let's go ahead and do the following so
17:14 - for the uh header we're gonna go ahead
17:16 - and add the following rules so i'll
17:17 - explain each of these ones
17:19 - as we do it so we're doing a line item
17:21 - center we're doing
17:22 - position sticky and what we're doing
17:24 - here if when we do position sticky with
17:26 - the top of zero
17:27 - what this does is if you go to the
17:29 - deployed app kazi
17:31 - and let's go ahead and scroll down on
17:33 - the deployed app so let's open up the
17:35 - deployed app
17:36 - and let's scroll down can you notice how
17:38 - the header is actually sticking to the
17:40 - top
17:40 - yeah i can see it's very yeah
17:44 - yeah so it does that because we've done
17:46 - position sticky and then top zero so it
17:48 - sticks to the top
17:49 - and that's how we get it to look like
17:51 - that now an important rule that we have
17:52 - to add is the z
17:54 - index so you have to say z index of 100
17:56 - 100 because
17:57 - and if we gave something else like 99 we
17:59 - want it to be
18:01 - going to be like sort of on top of
18:02 - everything else so it covers everything
18:04 - we're going to give it a background
18:05 - color of white
18:06 - which is what we see and expect and a
18:08 - width of 100
18:09 - because we want to span the entire width
18:11 - so that's going to do that for us
18:13 - the next thing we want to do is we've
18:14 - already started the header icon which is
18:16 - awesome
18:17 - we want to basically william cruz says
18:19 - the best of the best you both are
18:22 - amazing
18:22 - sunny would be nice to see you working
18:25 - with react
18:26 - native challenge accepted dude
18:29 - we will get on to that and we will start
18:31 - building something really native
18:32 - i haven't used it in a while so i mean
18:34 - we can definitely i'm excited to go back
18:36 - into it
18:37 - i know people are asking what happened
18:39 - yesterday because i wasn't on the live
18:41 - stream i was
18:42 - i shared like my dog got hurt so um
18:45 - i'm gonna share some of that with you
18:46 - guys so this is actually our puppy her
18:48 - name is pudgy
18:50 - and she ended up like really breaking
18:52 - her nail pretty bad so that's why
18:54 - yesterday we had to go to the er frankie
18:56 - ended up taking over
18:57 - the stream uh then we were waiting at
19:01 - the
19:03 - um at the vets for hours and here that's
19:06 - my girlfriend that's amber lee that's
19:07 - pudgy right there
19:10 - she was pretty hurt and then we pretty
19:12 - much
19:13 - got her back and this is
19:16 - this is what she's up to now so you can
19:19 - see
19:20 - she's passed out she got a little like
19:23 - cast on her
19:24 - arm right there and yeah got a call
19:28 - so she can't bite it off but yeah she's
19:31 - getting big really really fast
19:34 - um dude it's horrible when you see a
19:36 - little one like a little dog sort of
19:37 - injured that's crazy they gave her a
19:39 - little
19:39 - car yeah a little like tiny cone
19:43 - she's so adorable she's probably playing
19:46 - with it
19:46 - like she's just sitting there like she's
19:48 - out of action
19:49 - with her crazy stuff was going on man
19:52 - and then yesterday like our freaking
19:54 - whole alarm like our sewage system like
19:57 - making crazy sounds and stuff and then
20:00 - releasing
20:00 - smell i'm like what is happening can we
20:03 - just get back to coding
20:07 - good damn it man
20:10 - at least we are back guys and i think
20:13 - that deserves to smash your thumbs up
20:14 - man
20:15 - yeah guys if you yeah for the little
20:18 - puppy
20:19 - you know yeah go ahead and smash that
20:21 - like button
20:23 - thank you people are saying blessing her
20:25 - a you says blessing for her courtney
20:27 - says beautiful dog
20:28 - she's a english bulldog she's four
20:30 - months old
20:31 - so to see her and then like the nail got
20:34 - broken so they had to like actually pull
20:36 - it out completely
20:37 - so that's why they put the cast on top
20:39 - of it
20:41 - yeah but uh yeah other than that let's
20:43 - keep in rocking and rolling now i'm back
20:46 - and ready to go guys and we're here and
20:48 - let's crush it
20:51 - so what we're gonna add now for the
20:54 - center is we're gonna say give it a
20:55 - max width and fix uh and fit the content
20:58 - so
20:59 - let's go ahead and do this so fit
21:01 - content like that
21:02 - and what we're going to do is boom and
21:04 - here i'm going to give it a bit of
21:06 - styling so we'll say panning at 10
21:07 - pixels a height of 30
21:09 - pixels so let's go ahead and do that
21:10 - save the file and you can now see that
21:12 - it should change a little bit
21:14 - uh oh oops i've added that's the wrong
21:15 - thing we should add it over here there
21:17 - we go
21:18 - add it to the header center and that
21:20 - will actually go ahead and pad that out
21:21 - a little bit
21:22 - now for the top right so the center
21:25 - element
21:25 - we're gonna go ahead and give it a
21:27 - border radius of 999 which is a perfect
21:29 - oval
21:30 - we're going to give it a one pixel solid
21:32 - light gray board and you can see now
21:34 - it's got a so very subtle light like
21:36 - sort of um
21:38 - light gray border around the top but we
21:40 - don't want that input field
21:42 - to actually have the border around
21:44 - itself so what we need to do is target
21:46 - it
21:46 - like this we say header center the
21:48 - direct charge which is an input and
21:50 - we're going to say border none
21:52 - so we're going to go ahead and do border
21:53 - none and what i'm going to do at this
21:54 - point is i'm going to say width of 250
21:56 - pixels
21:58 - like this and now guys you can see if we
22:01 - go ahead and do this so actually at this
22:02 - point we'll keep it responsive let's go
22:04 - ahead and
22:05 - get rid of this for a second but what we
22:07 - can actually say is we can say
22:10 - um
22:12 - let's leave it as width 250 for now uh
22:14 - let's go ahead and do that and then on
22:15 - the header right
22:16 - what we're going to do is we're going to
22:17 - say justify content space between those
22:20 - icons
22:21 - we want to give some space between them
22:23 - we're also going to give it a width of
22:24 - 15 view it and a margin right of 80
22:26 - pixels so i'm going to go ahead and do
22:28 - that right now
22:29 - and this will go ahead and it should
22:31 - space it out a little bit more
22:33 - and there we go so let's go ahead and do
22:36 - this for now
22:37 - because let's actually make it a big
22:39 - screen uh
22:40 - sure think boom there we go
22:44 - nice now you guys can see everything is
22:46 - spaced out evenly we've got a nice
22:48 - little bit of spacing
22:49 - and what you can do at this point for
22:50 - desktop support you can do a width of
22:52 - 250 pixels and you see
22:54 - the middle goes into that but for now to
22:56 - keep it super responsive i'm going to
22:57 - actually comment now so
22:58 - let's go ahead and do half half again
23:05 - nice and what we're going to do now is
23:09 - for that input field what i want to
23:12 - actually say is give it a padding
23:13 - of 10 pixels and then outline width of
23:15 - 0. and what this does guys is now
23:17 - because if you go ahead and click the
23:19 - input field
23:21 - damn effort just dropped five pounds he
23:24 - says damn you guys are just
23:25 - awesome enough said hope you make a web
23:28 - app with an admin interface someday
23:30 - i've actually heard a lot of people say
23:31 - that so we will go ahead and actually
23:32 - make some kind of
23:33 - admin crud functionality app or
23:36 - something
23:36 - by the way i figured out finally how to
23:39 - actually
23:39 - increase the size of this thing that was
23:42 - thanks to leif i was on the coaching
23:44 - call
23:44 - for a profitable shortcut and he was
23:47 - like dude you can increase the size of
23:48 - this and i'm like oh oh
23:50 - nice that makes life so much easier so
23:52 - yeah thank you efosa
23:54 - really appreciate it and yeah this is
23:56 - another reason i actually really like
23:58 - django as a web framework because
24:00 - it comes in with a badass built-in admin
24:03 - interface
24:04 - which is so freaking nice too but i
24:07 - think
24:07 - a django and react combo could be really
24:10 - fun
24:11 - that would be awesome dude because i
24:12 - want to learn a lot of django that would
24:14 - be awesome to do that
24:16 - nice so kazi go ahead and click the
24:18 - input field
24:20 - yep and now can you see there's no blue
24:23 - outline
24:24 - right you don't get any blue out there
24:26 - but if i if i actually uh
24:28 - comment out the outline width uh oh no
24:30 - oops i'm on the wrong corner if i go and
24:32 - comment out the outline with
24:34 - this one and we now do can you see you
24:36 - get that nasty
24:38 - outline right yeah kind of defeats the
24:41 - entire ui
24:42 - so what you need to do is outline width
24:43 - of zero and that actually gets rid of it
24:46 - and now it just looks plain yeah and
24:49 - that's how you get that sort of desire
24:51 - right and it's a boolean type of thing
24:52 - right so whether you have zero and one
24:54 - that's the same
24:55 - even if you had a hundred it'll be the
24:57 - same
24:58 - exactly yeah okay dope yeah
25:03 - so that we're gonna switch to zero and
25:04 - then you'll be able to get that
25:06 - so that's really clean and with that
25:08 - said the header is pretty much done at
25:10 - this point right so the header at this
25:12 - point is done
25:13 - uh which is awesome so now we can
25:15 - actually go back to
25:16 - the uh app.js file and we can see that
25:19 - we've got our header over here and now
25:21 - we're going to focus on the home
25:22 - component
25:23 - right so let's go back into home and
25:26 - previously we had this where we said
25:28 - home components let's go ahead and see
25:30 - now you can see the home component
25:31 - renders in underneath um
25:34 - underneath the the header now i can see
25:36 - some people have just completed the
25:37 - google clone that's awesome
25:41 - yeah i love seeing people that oh damn
25:43 - louise eduardo just dropped
25:45 - 20 us dollars wait hold on hold on
25:48 - whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
25:51 - whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa damn
25:58 - thank you so much luis eduardo really
26:00 - appreciated holy crap you guys
26:03 - i mean yesterday i had to pay 400
26:06 - for my dog so this is actually helping
26:09 - out you know
26:10 - this actually thank you so much
26:13 - really appreciate it that's insane thank
26:16 - you so much
26:18 - wow somebody said we have 20 dislikes

26:23 - dollars to make up for all those
26:25 - dislikes
26:27 - nice appreciate it appreciate that dude
26:31 - so with that said let's go to the
26:33 - home.js component right
26:35 - so what we're going to be building next
26:37 - is a fun component is the
26:38 - banner right so that really beautiful
26:41 - banner that we see
26:42 - so to get that banner up and running
26:44 - let's go ahead and create banner.js
26:46 - so i've just created that file and we
26:48 - should pop into it in just
26:49 - a second
26:53 - and we are in that file now and if i do
26:55 - rfce
26:56 - and the snippets should load there we go
26:59 - and we can see banner and then just do
27:01 - our little setup so we say class name
27:03 - equals banner
27:04 - and at the top of the file i'm going to
27:05 - go ahead and import
27:08 - oops import banner
27:12 - dot css there we go save the file
27:15 - and it's going to complain because it
27:16 - doesn't have a banner.css so let's go
27:18 - ahead and create that file

29:48 - of the banner component now
29:50 - it says banner is not defined and that's
29:52 - because inside of here we need to do an
29:54 - import so let's go ahead and say import
29:56 - import architect i've got a new keyboard
29:58 - import banner

33:30 - what we're going to do is we have the
33:31 - banner
33:32 - and we want to basically get this to a
33:34 - point so let's go ahead and put the
33:36 - banner over here we've got banner.css
33:38 - and just going to target the banner and
33:40 - what i'm going to say here
33:42 - is that the banner should have a height
33:44 - of 50
33:45 - view height so this is going to be
33:46 - pretty much say it's got 50
33:48 - percent of the screen that's going to be
33:50 - its height right so we're going to say
33:51 - that we want to be position relative
33:53 - because we're going to have some things
33:54 - positioned inside of it and we want to
33:56 - do some
33:57 - funky stuff with that and then what i'm
33:59 - going to do is i'm going to set the
34:00 - background
34:02 - to an image right so the background of
34:04 - this i'm going to set it to an image and
34:05 - this background
34:06 - i'm going to set it to is actually an
34:08 - image of like a sort of airbnb looking
34:10 - building
34:11 - right so let's go ahead and do this and
34:12 - save it
34:14 - and now you can actually see if we go
34:16 - ahead
34:17 - and actually make that a bit bigger
34:18 - quasi
34:20 - so let's go ahead and make that a bit
34:21 - bigger we should be able to see why is
34:24 - it looking like oh yeah oops so we've
34:25 - got that right now you can see the image
34:27 - is there
34:28 - but it's not centered right so all we
34:30 - need to do is add these two lines at the
34:31 - end saying center
34:32 - center and this will center it
34:34 - horizontally vertically and you can see
34:36 - boom there you go
34:37 - you get like a very nice centered image
34:40 - yeah
34:41 - so that's really cool looks super clean
34:43 - let's go ahead and do half half again
34:48 - nice and what we're going to do now is
34:50 - where it says i am a banner you notice
34:52 - how it's the background of the div that
34:54 - we actually set
34:55 - right so i'm going to actually go here
34:57 - and change this now so we actually have
34:59 - inside of it i'm going to have not i am
35:01 - a banner but i'm going to create a div
35:03 - so i'm going to say div and this div is
35:05 - going to have a class name so i'm going
35:06 - to say class name
35:07 - and this is going to be banner info
35:09 - right so it's going to be banner
35:11 - info and this is going to be responsible
35:13 - for the text that you see
35:14 - so that black block of text that you
35:16 - guys saw in the previous uh build so
35:20 - what we're going to have inside of here
35:21 - is a h1 which says get out and stretch
35:23 - your imagination
35:24 - the reason why we don't i didn't think
35:26 - of that that was what was on the website
35:27 - that's what's actually on the airbnb
35:29 - website and then we're going to have a
35:30 - h5
35:32 - um i think you're muted quasi
35:38 - yep very good no i know but i wasn't
35:40 - talking
35:42 - oh yeah i thought i saw you talking to
35:45 - the camera
35:46 - nice oh no no i was just i was just
35:48 - staring everybody down in the live
35:50 - stream making sure they were
35:51 - they knew i was paying attention and
35:53 - watching them
35:55 - nice so now you can see let's go ahead
35:57 - and refresh localhost because there's
35:58 - some reason it does this when we pair
36:00 - program
36:01 - um let's go ahead and refresh quasi
36:05 - localhost 3000
36:07 - and then what we're going to do is we
36:09 - are going to have so now you can see it
36:11 - says get out and stretch your
36:12 - imagination
36:13 - here's some good comments by the way i
36:15 - just want to shout them out
36:17 - malwaniki says after trying tons of boot
36:21 - camps i found my yoda
36:22 - you guys are the best and robert says
36:25 - thanks your streams and videos are great
36:27 - keep going guys learned a lot from you
36:30 - nice and you know what guys even if
36:32 - you're a beginner
36:33 - just follow along with the builds and i
36:34 - say this even to the students inside the
36:36 - course follow along with these builds
36:37 - it's pattern recognition just by
36:39 - following along with the build every
36:41 - single time
36:42 - you start to pick this stuff up
36:43 - naturally like if you go along with
36:45 - every single build
36:46 - it's impossible not to learn right so go
36:48 - ahead and make sure you do that and you
36:50 - guys will naturally pick up these skills
36:53 - nice so with that said let's actually go
36:56 - ahead and add an explore nearby button
36:58 - right so let's go ahead and add that
37:00 - button in so let's go ahead and do it
37:01 - here so say button
37:03 - and it's a capital b because we're using
37:05 - the material ui button so we need to go
37:07 - ahead and import that at the top of the
37:08 - file
37:09 - let's go ahead and pop down at the top
37:11 - and then here i'm going to say explore
37:14 - explore nearby oops explore there
37:17 - by like this and then i'm going to go
37:19 - ahead and give this a variant so i'm
37:20 - going to say this is a variant of
37:22 - outlined so material ui allows you to
37:24 - pass props to its components
37:26 - this one changes the look and feel of
37:27 - that button so the explore button you
37:30 - can't actually see it very well but you
37:31 - can actually see it now
37:33 - and there buttons in the chat hey she
37:35 - goes sorry fashionably late
37:38 - the girlfriend's always supporting nice
37:40 - and so now we've got explore nearby
37:42 - um and now what we're going to do is
37:44 - actually go ahead and style this banner
37:46 - info
37:47 - so it looks a lot nicer than what we're
37:50 - seeing right now
37:52 - right so let's go ahead and do banner on
37:54 - the squad score info
37:56 - and let's do this a balance for info
37:59 - oops info
38:00 - and let's actually go ahead and change
38:02 - the background color of this to black
38:04 - so let's change the background color to
38:05 - black and
38:07 - let's do this so we're going to say
38:11 - color of white as well so change the
38:12 - color because now we remember we just
38:14 - set the background color to brown
38:16 - to black so the text is also going to be
38:18 - hidden so we need to make the color
38:20 - white and you can see now we can see
38:22 - that the color of that stuff right
38:24 - so um
38:27 - now what we're going to do is
38:36 - now so let's go ahead and do color white
38:38 - and what we're going to do is we're
38:39 - going to add some padding right so
38:40 - these are different values we're going
38:42 - to be using i'll run you guys through
38:43 - what each one is
38:44 - so padding top i'm saying give it 25
38:47 - padding top
38:48 - i want padding left 50 pixels padding
38:50 - right 50 pixels padding bottom 40 pixels
38:53 - um and then i'm going to say the width
38:54 - should be 300 pixels
38:56 - max right so the width of 300 pixels and
38:59 - that will actually tie in a little bit
39:00 - and now what's really nice about this
39:02 - design guys is that if you actually go
39:03 - ahead and make this
39:05 - uh bigger kazi we should be able to see
39:07 - that this will actually it's a very nice
39:08 - sort of overlay
39:10 - right so let's go ahead and make it
39:11 - bigger you see it like it kind of looks
39:13 - pretty neat how
39:14 - it's in there right um so you can kind
39:17 - of get that thing
39:18 - and then like yeah it looks super neat
39:20 - by the way
39:21 - ramraj says please consider adding
39:23 - tracked
39:25 - module in the pwg course what's tracked
39:28 - maybe he misspelled react
39:30 - i don't know yeah i think he might be
39:33 - talking about react inside the pwg
39:35 - course we actually do
39:36 - have a bunch of content we have a loads
39:38 - of coaching calls on inside the course
39:40 - and we're actually dropping some modules
39:41 - on react
39:42 - so everything is going to be inside that
39:44 - course yeah and apparently ashish
39:46 - uh enjoyed marabon and sunny's dance
39:49 - video on savage
39:50 - love on tick tock hey nice
39:54 - quit getting that clout damn yeah
39:57 - there we go all right so because
40:01 - do you teach hacking oh man if you
40:05 - if you consider debugging hacking let's
40:07 - go
40:08 - yeah right so now what we're going to do
40:11 - is we're going to change the style of
40:12 - that button right so let's go ahead and
40:14 - target the buttons we're going to say
40:15 - banner info
40:16 - the direct child which is a button and
40:18 - i'm going to go ahead and do background
40:19 - color
40:20 - and i went and actually saved you guys
40:21 - some time and i
40:23 - found the color of airbnb
40:26 - which is this right here so if we do
40:28 - that you can see the button pops in
40:30 - right
40:30 - now i you can see by default material ui
40:33 - give makes everything uppercase for some
40:35 - weird reason
40:36 - so to get rid of that you do text
40:37 - transform inherit and i'll get rid of
40:39 - that uppercase
40:40 - oh just got another donation by manav
40:43 - aurora
40:44 - i think i've seen him in a few of these
40:45 - videos awesome he says pwa
40:48 - or react native what will be great for a
40:50 - project
40:51 - depends on what you're doing dude so pwa
40:53 - is progressive web app
40:55 - i'd recommend go with that until you
40:57 - need a native app
40:58 - and i love what ram raj is saying he
41:00 - goes i'm loving the pwg course already
41:02 - way to go thanks for the awesome content

44:45 - dollars
44:45 - it because most people send us messages

44:51 - camps that they paid for
44:53 - and in about in next week we're going to
44:55 - be doing a challenge for react
44:57 - and during that challenge we're going to

46:12 - say yeah
46:13 - and guys like i can't stress enough like
46:15 - if you think that you if you enjoy the
46:17 - live streams
46:18 - me qazi nars the entire team frank we
46:20 - put our heart into this
46:21 - this into this program so like
46:23 - everything that we love and we aspire to
46:25 - like to
46:26 - to make an impact in this sort of uh in
46:28 - this community is inside that program so
46:30 - like if you want to be a part of that
46:32 - then just jump in yeah
46:33 - 100 percent let's keep rocking
46:37 - rolling nice with that said guys we were
46:40 - on the banner right so
46:42 - we just added in the text transform
46:45 - inherit line of code which actually
46:46 - changes the button text
46:48 - to lowercase because we don't want it to
46:50 - be super everything like screaming at
46:52 - you
46:52 - right now it's touching the top text so
46:54 - i'm going to do is margin top of 20
46:55 - pixels font weight of 600
46:57 - and you'll see that pushes the button
46:59 - slightly away from
47:00 - the um top of the text which is awesome
47:03 - so we want to make sure that that's done
47:05 - also the h5 tags so the one which says
47:07 - plan a different kind of get away to
47:08 - uncover the hidden gems near you
47:10 - gonna go ahead and target that and give
47:12 - it a margin top of
47:14 - five pixels um because we need to
47:16 - actually set up prettier because for
47:18 - some reason priya doesn't do it when we
47:19 - save
47:21 - um which is a bit annoying but will not
47:23 - work
47:24 - bro i think live share causes these
47:26 - problems
47:28 - yeah it's fine we can we can carry them
47:30 - without this one
47:31 - so we've got the h5 and what we want to
47:34 - do guys is when we hover over that
47:36 - button
47:36 - right so right now when we hover over
47:38 - that button it's not very responsive
47:40 - right so
47:41 - um it's gonna actually change to a
47:43 - different color
47:44 - so kazi if we actually go ahead and
47:47 - hover over the explore nearby button
47:49 - um yeah so guys that p that slack group
47:53 - bara just asked do we need to be
47:55 - a member uh of profit with javascript to
47:58 - join the slack group
47:59 - yes you have to be because that
48:03 - the way we keep the quality just
48:05 - incredible in that group
48:06 - is by whoever joins profit javascript
48:08 - gets access to our
48:10 - community as well and i think community
48:12 - is actually one of the best
48:13 - parts of that program so what did you
48:15 - want me to do sonny
48:17 - uh if you just hover over the explorer
48:20 - i saw some people in the comment in the
48:22 - comments saying who's the guy in the
48:23 - back
48:25 - frankie frankie
48:28 - oh yeah guys that's frankie over here uh
48:31 - he's getting some sick shots actually so
48:33 - let me show you guys actually the photo
48:34 - that he just took
48:36 - and uh look at the setup here i mean
48:39 - that looks
48:40 - amazing this is my setup right now to do
48:43 - this live stream
48:44 - this is all we have to do to actually
48:46 - make the make it come true
48:49 - nice dude awesome were you sharing your
48:51 - pho oh nice yeah i see it oh awesome
48:54 - yeah nice dope so yeah that's thank you
48:57 - guys
48:58 - uh so no it's been cause you hovered
49:00 - over the explore nearby button it went
49:02 - black right we don't actually want it to
49:03 - go black because it doesn't look very
49:05 - clean
49:06 - what we're going to do instead is target
49:07 - it so that when we hover over it so when
49:09 - we add this
49:10 - hover attribute it's going to change the
49:12 - background color to white and then the
49:13 - text to so it's basically going
49:15 - invert one second i forgot i'm sorry i
49:17 - keep doing this but i don't want to miss
49:19 - this
49:20 - so i forgot about this comment somebody

49:42 - nice so with that said so if you hover
49:44 - over the explorer nearby you'll see the
49:46 - colors should invert now
49:47 - yeah oh nice that looks clean like a
49:50 - crisp little look to that
49:52 - uh and what we're gonna do now is
49:54 - actually go ahead and have so we've done
49:56 - that sort of
49:57 - very nice sort of look and feel to that
49:59 - part what we're going to do is have an
50:01 - actual search button at the top so
50:02 - search prompt which says search dates
50:04 - right so at this point to add that
50:07 - search button i'm going to go ahead
50:09 - add a another div on on top of this
50:12 - on this one we're going to call someone
50:16 - say div
50:16 - like here i'm going to give it a class
50:18 - name so i'm going to say class name
50:21 - last name of banner and this is going to
50:24 - be banner underscore underscore search
50:26 - like this and here i'm going to
50:28 - basically add in
50:29 - a button so i'm going to say a button
50:31 - will exist here
50:33 - and this button will essentially say at
50:35 - this point we're going to say just
50:36 - search
50:36 - dates right so something like this
50:38 - button search dates
50:40 - and what i want to do is i'm going to
50:41 - give it a variant of outline so i'm
50:43 - going to go ahead and do this
50:45 - uh oops i've forgot that we don't have
50:47 - previous i'm going to go ahead and do
50:48 - variant
50:49 - of outlined oops variant of outline
50:54 - like this awesome and then what i'm
50:57 - going to do is give it a class name as
50:58 - well
50:59 - so i'm going to go ahead and say class
51:00 - name
51:02 - of banner underscore underscore search
51:05 - button
51:05 - so we can start this later on so banner
51:07 - search button and with that said it
51:09 - should we should have a button
51:11 - on top and you can see it's actually
51:12 - there it's a little bit difficult to see
51:14 - but it's actually sitting there at the
51:15 - top and it says search dates at the top
51:17 - so that's very clean now we're going to
51:19 - go ahead and style that so
51:21 - whenever we give a material ui class
51:25 - a class we actually need to style it
51:26 - with the important properties so i'm
51:28 - going to go ahead
51:29 - and add the following styles to that
51:31 - button i'm going to say a background
51:32 - color of white
51:33 - i'm going to say the font weight should
51:35 - be 900
51:36 - and it should have a text transform so
51:38 - to get rid of the uppercase
51:40 - text and we're going to give it the text
51:42 - itself a color of
51:43 - the airbnb pink so that's how we get
51:45 - that look and feel
51:47 - and then what i'm going to say is for
51:50 - the banner search so the actual div
51:52 - surrounding it i'm going to say go ahead
51:55 - and do the following so i'm going to say
51:56 - give it a top of zero so it should be
51:58 - attached to the top give it a display
52:00 - flex so actually let's go ahead and get
52:01 - rid of this one
52:02 - we can do display flex and then we're
52:05 - going to say flex direction
52:07 - column and this will actually span the
52:08 - entire width
52:10 - of the screen so display column and now
52:13 - you should see it takes up the top of
52:14 - the column so you see at the top now we
52:15 - have that search dates
52:17 - and i'm going to get rid of the home
52:18 - component text over there because that's
52:20 - just ugly right now
52:22 - so boom there we go you've got the
52:24 - search dates at the top
52:25 - right so that looks clean but what we
52:28 - want to do now
52:29 - is have it so that when you click search
52:31 - dates we essentially change it so it
52:33 - says search dates and then hide
52:35 - search dates and hide and i have to to
52:37 - demonstrate this go to the deployed
52:39 - version quasi
52:44 - yeah let's go and if you click on search
52:45 - dates
52:47 - so you see it says hide at the top and
52:49 - then it says search dates
52:50 - every time you click the button it
52:52 - changes the state right
52:54 - right so we want to get that
52:55 - functionality and then basically we
52:57 - nice little like a nice little animation
53:00 - when i click it at the top
53:02 - yeah so that's actually already in there
53:05 - at the moment so if you go ahead and go
53:06 - to r1
53:07 - so that's the reason why we get that is
53:11 - because we're using the material ui
53:13 - button
53:14 - nice okay yeah so that's why we
53:17 - get that one right there so awesome so
53:21 - now what we're going to do is we are
53:23 - going to go to
53:25 - the um search dates and what we've got
53:29 - to do to
53:30 - get this functionality is actually add
53:31 - in a piece of state so the piece of
53:33 - state that we're going to add in so
53:34 - state is essentially just how you write
53:36 - a variable inside of react
53:38 - uh here we're going to have a piece of
53:39 - state which is called show search
53:42 - right and the reason why we're going to
53:43 - do this is because we want this but we
53:45 - want this variable
53:47 - to keep track of if we click that button
53:49 - or not and by default initially when we
53:51 - click it
53:51 - we're going to have false and the reason
53:53 - why we want to do this is because we're
53:55 - going to say if you click it so let's
53:57 - just say for example
53:58 - um whenever it says show search or if so
54:02 - show search is true then i basically
54:04 - want to render out the search element
54:06 - that you guys saw earlier so
54:07 - let's just say show such uh show date
54:11 - picker let's show show date because
54:12 - that's what we're trying to do here
54:14 - um exactly now if we go ahead and
54:17 - say it says use state is not defined we
54:19 - need to import that
54:21 - so we need to import that as such at the
54:23 - top of the file
54:24 - there we go save it and then we should
54:26 - be able to see
54:28 - now if we save that so kazi now if we
54:32 - actually change this to true you should
54:35 - be able to see
54:36 - that it should say show date picker
54:38 - awesome and if i change this to false
54:40 - it goes ahead and it hides that right so
54:44 - now we have some kind of
54:45 - functionality to it right so what we
54:47 - need to do is that button
54:49 - we're going to tie the functionality to
54:50 - that button so i'm going to say on click
54:52 - of that button whenever you click that
54:54 - button i'm going to shoot off an arrow
54:56 - function
54:56 - so it's going to shoot off a function
54:58 - and this is going to say
55:00 - set show search to whatever
55:04 - the opposite of show search currently so
55:06 - if it's currently true
55:08 - it's going to become false if it's
55:09 - currently false it's going to become
55:10 - true
55:11 - so now to show this in practice kazi go
55:13 - ahead and hit the search date button
55:15 - or search yeah search dates
55:19 - and now you can see show date picker
55:20 - there we go so you see we have some kind
55:22 - of functionality to it now
55:24 - right and now that is gonna that
55:27 - basically sets us up for the next part
55:29 - this the next part is essentially
55:30 - building
55:31 - that beautiful date picker that you guys
55:33 - see in the final build which is that
55:35 - really nice
55:36 - all right i'll add that i'll add that to
55:37 - the top so currently we're working on
55:39 - building the date picker
55:41 - yep we're building the date picker at
55:43 - the moment
55:47 - okay i just added that to the top
55:51 - awesome so now what we're going to do
55:54 - is let's go ahead and go to
55:58 - um let's go ahead and actually go to
56:02 - we need to basically we're going to
56:03 - replace this show date picker
56:05 - with some kind of component which looks
56:07 - like this so we're going to have a
56:08 - search
56:08 - component right and this search
56:11 - component should render out to be
56:13 - essentially what we see in the final
56:14 - product so let's go ahead and create
56:16 - search.js so we should snap into that
56:18 - file
56:19 - any second now i've just created a
56:21 - search.js file
56:23 - and boom we are in it and if we do rfce
56:27 - we should get our es7 snippet and let's
56:30 - go ahead and do our normal
56:31 - bem naming convention so we say search
56:34 - let's go ahead and create the
56:35 - appropriate css file so we're going to
56:37 - import from search.css
56:39 - save that create the search.css file
56:43 - nice um by the way we just broke
56:46 - 1 000 likes
56:50 - yeah thank you guys so much for that
56:53 - that is
56:54 - huge and miraban says that
56:57 - if sunny could he would shower with the
57:00 - airpods
57:03 - chris cavern
57:07 - chris thanks so much for the five dollar
57:10 - donation
57:10 - really appreciate you damn and he goes
57:14 - finishing up the hulu
57:15 - shadow clone you did yesterday but
57:17 - wanted to show some love
57:19 - hey that's awesome dude glad you're
57:21 - doing that
57:22 - because yeah the hulu clone was the
57:24 - hooligan was one of the funnest builds i
57:26 - didn't think it would be that fun but it
57:27 - was free if you guys haven't
57:29 - yeah if you guys haven't that's
57:30 - something which like just looks
57:32 - so nice on your portfolio like the hulu
57:34 - clone um
57:36 - it might already be deployed actually so
57:37 - you might have it um
57:40 - is it clone let me go ahead and see if
57:43 - i've got it so i've got the actual link
57:44 - here i can drop it to you and
57:46 - let's go ahead and do it i'll drop it in
57:48 - the code quasi so
57:49 - go ahead and check out that okay boom
57:53 - all right got it
57:57 - so this is the one you guys built
57:59 - yesterday damn it just looks
58:01 - so freaking slick like look at that
58:05 - wow yeah and it's completely uh
58:07 - connected to an api
58:09 - so if you go to the top and you actually
58:11 - go ahead and click because i was
58:12 - wondering i'm like how much
58:14 - accurate dummy text and data did you
58:17 - guys
58:17 - add like holy crap oh wow so if i
58:21 - actually change
58:22 - horror romance it changes yo this build
58:25 - is actually sick
58:26 - kind of regret that i wasn't like here
58:28 - for this build
58:31 - this one was pretty fun yeah like look
58:33 - at how juicy it all looks like
58:36 - even before the even the animations like
58:39 - me and frankie were saying adding those
58:40 - animations
58:41 - changes it from a website to an app yeah
58:44 - yeah true true true yeah
58:48 - that's true so this is the kind this is
58:50 - the kind of app that you guys would see
58:51 - on like a fire stick tv
58:53 - app or something you know like this is
58:55 - the kind of thing that you would be used
58:56 - to seeing
58:57 - as opposed to just a website like you so
59:00 - you could probably build this deploy on
59:01 - some kind of fire stick app
59:03 - and yeah that'd be awesome
59:07 - nice somebody asked luke says why don't
59:09 - you guys work at google
59:11 - guys we're not the guys who work at
59:12 - google we get the guys who work at
59:15 - google
59:16 - at google
59:23 - yeah hopefully in the next one or two
59:27 - years like
59:29 - the probability of somebody asking like
59:31 - how'd you get a job at google
59:33 - like and somebody were like saying
59:35 - clever programmer would be like
59:36 - massive like hey it was a clever
59:38 - programmer
59:41 - exactly nice so with that said let's go
59:45 - ahead and build the search functionality
59:47 - so let's go back to search and here this
59:50 - is where
59:51 - this is going to be an intricate part of
59:52 - it are we building search or date picker
59:56 - yeah uh so we're building the date
59:58 - picker but this is it's part basically
60:00 - the date picker is the search component
60:03 - [Music]
60:07 - [Laughter]
60:12 - um
60:14 - okay all right i mean i i don't underst
60:16 - how does that work
60:20 - this is the date picker component yeah
60:22 - right
60:23 - so are we working are we not working on
60:25 - the data picker component then okay okay
60:26 - all right i'll just let you keep going
60:27 - yeah
60:28 - well yeah we are yeah the search
60:30 - component i'm gonna add this in here
60:32 - date picker component there we go
60:35 - all right so
60:39 - um now we've got the i think maybe loves
60:42 - your chair

60:58 - that
60:59 - you know there's a proper stream of
61:00 - streaming yeah yeah yeah and then it has
61:03 - like this
61:04 - back support thing which is hard to show
61:06 - right now but
61:07 - it's right here this thing right there
61:10 - nice so it has yeah
61:13 - because what was happening with other
61:15 - chair was i couldn't like

62:12 - [Laughter]
62:16 - all right here we go
62:24 - so inside the date picker we need to do
62:27 - a few things right so the thing that
62:29 - actually allows all that date picker
62:31 - magic
62:31 - to happen is um the react
62:35 - date range so i'm trying to kill the
62:37 - laughter inside

64:50 - let's do it dude
64:51 - i'm down i want to learn jiu-jitsu as
64:53 - well i'll be sick
64:54 - yeah so now guys we're going to import
64:58 - the date range picker so this is like a
65:00 - very handy
65:01 - mpm module that i found um
65:05 - and we've got we're going to import and
65:07 - now you also need to import two other
65:09 - files
65:09 - so these are css files that the guys who
65:12 - made this
65:12 - uh module recommend that you you bring
65:15 - in and this is because basically this is
65:17 - this is going to give you all that
65:18 - styling that you guys saw in the final
65:20 - one
65:21 - that's how the date picker looks the way
65:23 - it looks
65:24 - [Laughter]
65:26 - sharia sharma said try capoeira
65:29 - that'd be fun that's fun and ashish says
65:31 - mma tutorials coming soon
65:34 - yeah and just to see us doing react one
65:37 - day
65:38 - jiu jitsu the next unboxing the day
65:41 - after that
65:42 - that's it nice so we've we
65:45 - imported the date range picker and to
65:47 - use it there's a few things we need to
65:49 - do
65:50 - now right so we need to add two pieces
65:51 - of state and
65:53 - to add those pieces of state it's very
65:54 - simple one is going to be for the
65:57 - start date and one is going to be for
65:59 - the end date
66:00 - so here we just done that so we've added
66:02 - in the start date and date let's go
66:04 - ahead and do
66:04 - yep that's it nice and for the start
66:06 - date we're going to give it a we're just
66:08 - using today's date as the initial value
66:10 - and for the end date we're doing today's
66:11 - date as well
66:12 - now once we've done that we need to
66:14 - actually add in the following
66:15 - object so here we basically say cons
66:18 - selection range
66:19 - now this stuff you don't really need to
66:20 - know why when you do it this way the
66:22 - main thing is
66:23 - is
66:27 - somebody said sonny can't stop laughing
66:28 - at frankie's chair
66:31 - it does make me laugh yeah frankie
66:34 - frankie show us your chair again
66:38 - oh [ __ ] it's because oh [ __ ]
66:41 - what happened here yo who's manning the
66:44 - [ __ ] live chat
66:47 - damn guys it's because
66:51 - you're like this you're like super stern
66:53 - on your jet you know
66:56 - bro i'm not leaving this thing bro i'm
66:58 - just glued to this thing
67:00 - because i've learned my lesson my neck
67:02 - starts breaking after doing the live
67:03 - streams
67:04 - yeah it does it does
67:10 - we need to add this selection range and
67:12 - this is something that they want you to
67:14 - do if you're using this so you need to
67:15 - do section range start date end date and
67:17 - then the key
67:18 - which is just selection i'm not sure
67:19 - what the key is for in this
67:21 - situation but you need to have it so add
67:24 - that in and then we're going to create a
67:25 - function
67:26 - and this function is basically
67:28 - responsible for
67:30 - this function is responsible for when
67:32 - you basically select a date so here
67:34 - we're saying whenever you select a date
67:36 - set the start date to whatever range you
67:39 - selected the start date
67:40 - and then set the end date whatever range
67:42 - you selected the end date
67:43 - now this is all done um by the library
67:46 - itself so we just need to have this
67:48 - function in here
67:49 - and then they handle everything else um
67:53 - so manavaro says are you going to launch
67:55 - any react native course and he just
67:57 - dropped a
67:57 - donation thank you for that thank you um
68:00 - yeah not a react native course at this
68:02 - point but react we're covering so
68:04 - uh yeah so we'll actually be dropping
68:06 - some content on react native very soon
68:08 - nice so we have the search here and now
68:10 - what we're going to do
68:12 - is we are actually going to go ahead and
68:15 - add in
68:19 - the following line of code now this is
68:20 - the date range picker itself so
68:22 - date range picker ranges we basically
68:25 - pass an array with selection range so
68:28 - this one here
68:29 - and that's an object and then on change
68:32 - we pass in our handle select function
68:34 - okay so this is stuff that i would
68:36 - recommend you guys just follow you
68:38 - literally just follow it along you do it
68:39 - as i've written it
68:40 - and everything will just work for you as
68:42 - well inside your project so
68:43 - cozy let's go ahead and open up our
68:45 - localhost
68:48 - and what i'm going to do is i'm going to
68:49 - import the search so import
68:52 - import search from
68:56 - search here there we go
69:00 - and now what we should be able to see is
69:03 - it says use state is undefined okay so
69:05 - you state is not fine we need to go
69:06 - ahead and do this
69:07 - nice save it and now it also says i
69:11 - can't read that it says
69:12 - cannot resolve something what does that
69:15 - say cannot resolve
69:17 - um let me go ahead and pop this in
69:19 - because oh yeah i've got it
69:21 - localhost 3000. nice
69:26 - but but it says cannot resolve date fns
69:29 - oh yes
69:30 - okay so this actually requires something
69:32 - called fns so you need to do mpmi
69:34 - so let's go ahead and pull it up npm i
69:36 - date fns
69:38 - so it's a peer dependency to be honest
69:40 - they should have
69:41 - set the modules up to actually do this
69:44 - for you
69:44 - but you need to do this step guys
69:46 - because you need that
69:48 - otherwise you're going to run into this
69:49 - issue so that's
69:52 - they're bad but it should be fine so now
69:54 - once that installs
69:56 - that should fix this issue for us
70:00 - um okay there we go so now
70:03 - if we actually see it should be loading
70:05 - up for us
70:06 - in a second so nice so now if we click
70:09 - search dates awesome because we go ahead
70:11 - and click search days
70:18 - hey
70:21 - nice it's opening that thing up bro
70:25 - let me refresh and let's click it again
70:28 - boom look at that got yesterday this
70:31 - week
70:32 - damn bro that they built all of that out
70:34 - of the box i was like
70:36 - i don't know why but i was thinking man
70:37 - i'm like sonny must have done a lot of
70:39 - math here
70:40 - to make this stuff work like damn bro
70:44 - i should have just made up some some
70:47 - excuse me like yeah dude
70:48 - you know what to be honest i have built
70:50 - one of these manually at a previous job
70:52 - and guys it's actually a headache to
70:54 - build that so
70:55 - using a package like this is actually
70:57 - really really handy
70:58 - and this one is actually looks beautiful
71:01 - it looks it looks really nice
71:03 - it's a really really good library to use
71:05 - because there's a lot of edge cases that
71:06 - you have to account for when you're
71:07 - doing this
71:08 - guys stop repeating questions in the
71:10 - chat
71:12 - we are gonna block you
71:15 - all right so now we're gonna do is let's
71:18 - go ahead and
71:19 - add in um let's go ahead and add in the
71:23 - following so
71:25 - i need to actually i want to check
71:26 - something actually i wonder if we
71:28 - removed this from underneath here
71:32 - and changed it over here and then we
71:34 - tried it so let's go ahead and
71:36 - save i just want to try something
71:38 - quickly
71:39 - so now if we go ahead and try and click
71:42 - the search dates
71:44 - okay that's pretty clean but it's not as
71:46 - nice as we want all right
71:48 - anyway so going back to the point so
71:49 - let's go ahead and we've added in this
71:51 - the
71:51 - this date picker functionality so we
71:53 - need to style it to look the way that we
71:55 - want it to look
71:56 - right so in order to get it to look like
72:00 - that
72:00 - we need to do a bunch of styling to this
72:02 - thing and in order to do that let's go
72:04 - ahead
72:05 - and do the following so inside of search
72:07 - this target search
72:09 - let's do the following so we're going to
72:10 - say position absolute uh top 35 pixels
72:13 - left 25
72:15 - width of 100 view it so um because if
72:18 - you go ahead and click
72:19 - on the search dates yo thanks adam
72:24 - whoa what happened to my voice there yo
72:27 - thanks adam
72:28 - for the 79 cent
72:31 - uh pound is it 79

73:11 - thank you dude so here we're going to do
73:13 - so click on search dates
73:15 - all right boom clicked yep
73:18 - and now as we style it you'll be able to
73:20 - see everything sort of move around as we
73:22 - need it so click leave that open
73:24 - uh what we're going to do you want me to
73:25 - make it half the screen
73:27 - yeah that's too hard enough nice so now
73:30 - what i'm going to do
73:31 - is i'm going to add in boom i'm going to
73:34 - add
73:34 - in this and we're going to make it so
73:36 - now it's saying top 35
73:38 - pixels from the top left 25 pixels and
73:42 - then
73:42 - width 100 view it let's do half and half
73:44 - kazi
73:46 - for this bit all right i will
73:51 - somebody is like yo if you guys are
73:53 - making so much money why
73:54 - do these little donations impress you
73:57 - guys
73:57 - that's the humility that actually got us
73:59 - here today
74:01 - exactly yeah and that would never change
74:04 - guys like even if somebody sent us one
74:06 - like literally no like thumbs up button
74:09 - yeah hitting the thumbs up button we're
74:10 - so grateful for like
74:12 - it literally doesn't like i remember in
74:14 - the beginning we started up and it was
74:15 - like a four dollar donation and it was
74:16 - like
74:17 - it blew our mind so yeah yeah
74:20 - dude is that what mike pence is he's a
74:23 - one
74:25 - yeah one uh pound one one cent
74:28 - one pounds uh no it's just a bad joke
74:32 - but okay got it
74:34 - nice so now what was this i was talking
74:37 - about this guy
74:38 - like mike pence but i'll just remove it
74:44 - all right so now we're gonna do
74:47 - the we're gonna target the h2 uh
74:50 - which is so right now we don't actually
74:52 - have a h2 element so i'm gonna go back
74:54 - to our search
74:55 - i'm going to add in a h2 which is
74:56 - basically going to be the number of
74:58 - guests so we're going to have that
74:59 - number of guests pop in underneath
75:01 - and then we're going to have number of
75:03 - guests and also
75:05 - we're going to have an input field for
75:07 - the number of guests
75:08 - so here we're going to have an input
75:10 - field for like how many guests you want
75:11 - to have and they're also going to have a
75:13 - button
75:13 - which says search airbnb right so i'm
75:16 - going to add a button
75:18 - so here i'm going to say
75:21 - i'm going to say button and i need to do
75:23 - an import for that
75:24 - and here i'm going to say search airbnb
75:26 - so let's go ahead and do that search
75:28 - airbnb
75:30 - let's go ahead and import that at the
75:31 - top so boom
75:34 - like that save the file and it says
75:37 - people icon is not defined because
75:39 - the people icon is an icon that we need
75:41 - to
75:43 - import from material ui so
75:46 - go ahead and save that hey adam tate
75:49 - just dropped another donation of two
75:51 - pounds he says thanks for taking your
75:52 - evenings up to do this
75:54 - dude you're welcome like it's insane the
75:55 - amount of value that we see you guys
75:57 - like you know
76:01 - thank you bro this guy's working his way
76:03 - up from pants to
76:04 - multiple pens thank you really
76:08 - appreciate it
76:09 - i think the first one was just a feeler
76:11 - you know
76:12 - yeah damn
76:17 - all right thank you bro nice so now
76:21 - what we're going to do is we have the
76:23 - dates popping up
76:25 - so again if you could just click on the
76:28 - search dates button cozy
76:32 - reason why we have to click it is
76:33 - because yeah it refreshes at times so
76:35 - now you can see it says
76:37 - search uh at the moment oh salman fazad
76:40 - uh for faizal has dropped five canadian
76:43 - dollars nice
76:44 - so we'll be coming back to call this
76:45 - later at my own pace just passing by to
76:48 - say thank you
76:49 - hold on let me pop that in let me pop
76:50 - that in okay now cover it
76:53 - so he says we'll be coming back to code
76:54 - this later on at my own pace
76:56 - just passing by to say thank you from
76:58 - everyone by the way we will be coding
77:00 - react native anytime soon
77:03 - of course dude we will be definitely
77:04 - calling react native soon so stay tuned
77:06 - for that and again massive thank you for
77:08 - donating that's it
77:08 - we really appreciate that thank you bro
77:12 - awesome so let's go ahead
77:16 - and do um
77:20 - the h2 yeah so now for the h2 what i'm
77:23 - going to do is i'm going to do this
77:24 - i'm going to copy a bunch of styles in
77:26 - here and i'll explain through what
77:27 - they're doing so
77:28 - as soon as i hit save on this you
77:30 - actually see the style looked a bit
77:32 - different there right and the reason why
77:33 - that happened is because i don't display
77:35 - flex align item center
77:37 - which means that the um we now have
77:40 - that icon so that people icon push to
77:43 - the right so
77:44 - um we now have the pupils uh cause you
77:47 - might need to move
77:48 - our face on the uh on ecam
77:52 - so let's move our face to maybe the
77:53 - center
77:55 - you got it because right now it's
77:57 - covering the number of guests
77:59 - um so so that should be you should go
78:02 - you guys should be obscene now on the
78:04 - drop down it says
78:05 - the number of guests and then it
78:07 - actually has that people icon and then
78:09 - we got that
78:10 - with justify content space between and
78:11 - display flex so now they're spaced apart
78:14 - and we gave it a width of five five nine
78:15 - padding of 10
78:16 - pixels background color of white
78:18 - position absolute left of zero and top
78:20 - of 380 pixels and
78:22 - the parent well we actually gave it a
78:24 - position relative so that's why
78:26 - it stays in its place so the next thing
78:29 - is i'm just going to go ahead and style
78:31 - the input so the input field
78:33 - is this one here so this one over here
78:36 - and
78:36 - this one i'm going to go ahead and do
78:38 - this so i'm going to say a width of 539
78:40 - padding of 20 pixels position absolute
78:42 - left 0 height 30 pixels
78:45 - top 420 and border of none so you guys
78:48 - can just go ahead and actually just use
78:49 - these styles and copy us
78:51 - and it will work for you um and that
78:54 - actually drops it down to the next line
78:55 - and that's actually a
78:56 - very nice um uh
79:00 - number sort of that you can now select
79:02 - and it will show you
79:03 - uh and the final thing that we're going
79:04 - to do or not the final thing but i
79:06 - basically now when you click the number
79:07 - of guests because you click on the the
79:09 - number two
79:10 - and you'll see that you'll see that
79:12 - nasty outline
79:13 - so uh not not that one it says number of
79:15 - guests
79:17 - yeah so you get that nasty outline so to
79:20 - get rid of that we add in this we say
79:21 - when we focus
79:22 - make the outline width zero so you can
79:25 - see it's gone now
79:26 - oh that is but now i can't hold on
79:30 - yeah it's definitely gone yeah it's true
79:33 - it's gone but
79:34 - the date picker kind of blends into the
79:36 - page a little bit so i can't see where
79:38 - it's ending but yeah definitely it looks
79:39 - much better
79:41 - yeah so right now that's fine because we
79:44 - will be adding a button which you'll be
79:46 - able to see in a sec
79:47 - so for the button to style we need to do
79:50 - the following we're going to say go
79:51 - ahead and target that button
79:53 - and do the following so position
79:56 - absolute left of zero
79:58 - but top four a text transform inherit
80:00 - and that's because we don't want to be
80:01 - uppercase
80:02 - background color of the airbnb color and
80:05 - then
80:06 - color white and width to 57579 and that
80:08 - will give you the exact perfect
80:09 - dimensions that you guys are going to
80:10 - need
80:11 - and it should do what we want
80:14 - so there you go you've got it looking
80:16 - pretty good but when you hover over so
80:18 - if cars if you hover over search airbnb
80:20 - right now you'll see it kind of goes
80:22 - transparent which is nasty
80:24 - like so the the search airbnb yeah we
80:26 - see that kind of
80:28 - we don't want that we want it to
80:30 - basically invert the colors
80:32 - right so to do so to do that we add this
80:34 - in we say
80:35 - when we hover whenever we hover over it
80:39 - we want to basically do a background
80:40 - color of white and a
80:42 - color text to be that so now
80:45 - if you do it and you hover over that you
80:48 - actually see it
80:50 - so if you click uh hover over search
80:52 - airbnb
80:53 - click it nice now it looks clean you
80:55 - want me to click it
80:57 - uh not yet not yet got it got it because
81:00 - i
81:00 - will click it danny finkelstein says
81:04 - keep up the awesome work guys i will

81:11 - thank you bro for that five dollar
81:13 - donation
81:14 - and say whoa okay nice danny
81:18 - thoroughly tonight hey
81:21 - let's go
81:24 - [Music]
81:26 - emotional code coming in with the heavy
81:29 - hidden
81:30 - twenty dollar donation thank you so much
81:32 - and all he said was
81:36 - that's his message to us thank you so
81:38 - much whenever i see like a 20
81:40 - donation or something i just picture
81:42 - somebody coming in swinging
81:44 - everything's frank seriously yeah this
81:47 - is just
81:48 - epic thank you for that we are at 111
81:51 - dollars in super chat thank you so much
81:54 - we just broke a hundred dollars and uh
81:56 - you guys are awesome
81:59 - that's insane thank you so much guys
82:01 - let's keep this going
82:04 - all right so now what we're gonna do
82:07 - is we are gonna have it so now we
82:08 - actually have that date picker component
82:10 - looking beautiful it looks really nice
82:12 - but when we click search dates we want
82:14 - to change the text
82:16 - and we want to change that text so that
82:17 - it actually says hide
82:19 - right so how do we do that we go back to
82:21 - banner and here
82:23 - where we had the search dates what we
82:25 - can do here is we can actually go ahead
82:27 - and change this now
82:29 - so that it says the following we can
82:30 - actually say
82:32 - we can do this we can get rid of this
82:36 - right and inside of here what we can do
82:38 - is we can say if
82:39 - show search is true then show hold up
82:42 - text
82:42 - otherwise sunny one second so sunny
82:46 - yeah hold up hold up hold up hold up
82:50 - how do we is there a way we can hide the
82:53 - side bar completely which one
82:56 - the status i think it's the is it the
82:59 - activity bar or the status bar
83:01 - oh you're talking about that blue stuff
83:03 - at the bottom
83:04 - on the left-hand side i think that's the
83:06 - status the on the left-hand side the one
83:09 - that with the file and the icons because
83:11 - the code is getting way
83:12 - too rap like it's getting wrapped up way
83:15 - too much
83:17 - um what we can do you know what i mean
83:19 - like it's looking too
83:20 - goofy now yeah i think we can do
83:24 - like what is this show sidebar
83:28 - i mean i can make it smaller but i think
83:30 - then it becomes really hard to read
83:32 - unless everybody's okay with reading
83:33 - that
83:35 - i think that's okay i think that's okay
83:38 - yeah i think that would be pretty good
83:40 - okay if you guys are okay with that
83:42 - text just let me know otherwise i can
83:43 - change it back
83:45 - yep and thank you so much devon
83:49 - for the five euro donation
83:52 - thank you so much brother i really
83:54 - appreciate it
83:56 - awesome that's nice thank you dude
83:59 - so now what we're going to do is we have
84:02 - the search dates
84:03 - uh added on and if you click on uh the
84:06 - search dates guys you saw in localhost
84:07 - 3000
84:09 - you'll notice it says hide so it's a
84:12 - search date and then it says hi
84:14 - yeah that's awesome so we have this whoa
84:18 - yeah okay if you make it bigger there
84:20 - you go it centers perfectly so
84:22 - you get a nice like little look to it

84:27 - so now we're gonna do is we're going to
84:30 - make it

86:12 - be called like a section
86:14 - right so it's going to be called so
86:15 - we're going to get a class name and this
86:17 - is going to be called
86:18 - uh home underscore section and what
86:20 - we're going to consider a section is
86:22 - going to be like a row of three cards
86:23 - for example
86:25 - so inside of here we're going to have
86:26 - three of those cards because let's go
86:27 - ahead and open up the actual app so the
86:30 - actual deployed version
86:32 - okay and we should be able to see inside
86:34 - inside the deployed version you can see
86:36 - we've got three cards in a row
86:37 - and then if we go down below we've got
86:39 - another three cards and this is fully
86:41 - responsive so they grow
86:42 - right so you can consider a section to
86:44 - be three cards
86:45 - right so we're going to have two
86:47 - sections um
86:49 - and then basically we're going to make
86:50 - it fully responsive so in this
86:52 - bit here we're going to have a card
86:54 - component which takes a bunch of props
86:56 - and it's basically going to be three so
86:58 - one we're going to hold another section
86:59 - so hold up hold up
87:00 - so one section is going to be three
87:05 - yep all right got it
87:08 - nice so these three and another section
87:11 - t3

88:17 - a snippet of code so it says home
88:20 - section and for those sections so those
88:21 - cards that you saw
88:23 - they're going to be inside of a row so
88:24 - it's going to be display flex and you're
88:26 - going to give it a padding of 30 pixels
88:28 - right so each one is going to have a
88:29 - padding of 30 pixels
88:30 - another great donation from shubham
88:32 - pandey thank you so much
88:35 - um we've got home section over here so
88:37 - the card we actually need to create a
88:39 - card component so
88:40 - let's go ahead and do card.js over here
88:44 - i'm going to create a card.js and
88:47 - it we should be inside of it stop it for
88:50 - a second bro and here we go gotem goes i
88:52 - recently completed your reels clone
88:56 - hey uh and he goes and believe me i got
88:59 - an internship in a local agency thank
89:01 - you so much
89:04 - um i think yeah the rules come as well
89:07 - interesting that's nice dude
89:11 - [Music]
89:16 - all right that's awesome right
89:19 - so now what we're going to do is we have
89:22 - the
89:22 - card component so i'm going to do rfce
89:25 - like this and then i'm going to create a
89:28 - class name so
89:28 - class name i'm going to do here card and
89:32 - we're going to go ahead and do
89:34 - oops we're going to go ahead and do
89:36 - import
89:39 - card.css like this oh no what did it
89:43 - happen to card.css there we go
89:45 - save the file and then inside of our
89:47 - card
89:48 - so the card is an interesting one it's
89:50 - going to take a few props so props in a
89:52 - functional component appear
89:54 - here so props basically our properties
89:56 - that we can pass the components which
89:57 - make them look different but we can
89:59 - reuse them
90:00 - so this one we're going to destructure
90:02 - at this point and we're going to say it
90:03 - takes a source
90:04 - it takes a title it takes a description
90:07 - it takes a price
90:09 - right and these are the different
90:11 - properties that we're going to be using
90:12 - um for when we reuse the
90:16 - card component which is awesome so now
90:19 - inside of the card what we're going to
90:20 - have is we're going to have an image
90:22 - tag so the image tag is going to
90:23 - basically take whatever
90:25 - prop whatever um source we pass in and
90:28 - that's going to be the source
90:29 - and then i'm going to create a div so we
90:32 - are we're done with the date picker
90:34 - right
90:36 - yeah we're sorry we're done with the day
90:37 - pick and now we're building the card
90:38 - components
90:40 - all right airbnb card components
90:43 - here we go nice
90:51 - awesome i changed it and i'm gonna drop
90:54 - [Music]
90:56 - all right and the greatest ever says i
90:57 - just started applying today
91:00 - oh dude that is nice so let me share
91:02 - that
91:03 - real quick he goes i just started
91:05 - applying today
91:06 - and when i get employed i will know for
91:08 - sure that it was because of these
91:09 - amazing lives
91:11 - and the amazing value shared will be
91:13 - sharing that story in pwj chat
91:16 - soon let's go let's go dude that's
91:20 - amazing
91:21 - the greatest ever has been on these live
91:22 - chat
91:24 - every single time yeah we know it's you
91:26 - guys yeah i know hajira i've seen her
91:28 - very often on these live streams um
91:31 - alexandros joins on these live streams
91:33 - quite a bit so thank you guys
91:35 - we really do appreciate you yeah exactly
91:38 - manav i think i've seen a few times
91:40 - there's definitely a few people here
91:41 - which we notice and we see you guys
91:43 - every time so that's awesome now
91:46 - we had the so we're saying uh
91:49 - card is not defined right that's because
91:51 - what we need to do is actually go ahead
91:53 - and import the card so let's go ahead
91:55 - and change this and let's do card
91:57 - like that now it will actually should
92:00 - fix that issue that we're having
92:03 - and inside over here what we can do is
92:06 - it says cannot resolve card.css
92:09 - so i need to go ahead and create
92:10 - card.css and we should pop into that
92:13 - right now
92:15 - uh in a second there we go card.css
92:19 - and now we should get rid of that error
92:21 - so it's all part of getting rid of these
92:23 - errors guys
92:24 - so for the card we have an image right
92:26 - then we have a card info so cars
92:28 - let's go ahead and pop open the deployed
92:29 - version and i'll give you a visual
92:31 - breakdown of what we're actually
92:33 - doing right now so the card info section
92:37 - is actually so you see we've got the
92:39 - image at the top
92:40 - and then underneath it we've got
92:42 - something like i'm just making a div
92:44 - called card info and now that contains
92:46 - the title the description
92:47 - and the price in some cases so if you go
92:50 - to the box oh hold up hold up what's the
92:52 - card it so card info is
92:54 - this here yep
92:57 - all right so that's going to be this
92:59 - title that description
93:01 - and then if you scroll down for the
93:02 - bottom cards they also have a price
93:05 - uh okay got it so boom there we go
93:09 - yeah and the way that we do that is i
93:11 - just popped it in here so
93:13 - we basically render out those things if
93:15 - they exist as a prop
93:17 - nice okay dope yeah and then inside of
93:21 - home
93:21 - so i'm actually saved you guys a bunch
93:23 - of times so i've actually gone ahead and
93:24 - pre-populated some of this stuff with
93:26 - some props so i'm gonna go ahead and
93:28 - swap these out with some
93:30 - properties um that i've basically went
93:32 - ahead and found
93:33 - um it's gonna to do some annoying stuff
93:36 - right now but let's go ahead and format
93:37 - this
93:38 - but what you guys can actually do at
93:39 - this point is go ahead and
93:41 - um you can pause the video and you can
93:44 - pretty much grab these what i've written
93:45 - for these different
93:46 - uh components the props that we're using
93:50 - but if i go ahead and save that now and
93:52 - let's go to our local host
93:55 - yeah so let's go right here
94:00 - nice hey soham just

94:40 - do that
94:42 - nice so we're going to go ahead and
94:44 - style some of these card components
94:47 - so let's go to our card and
94:50 - for card the css what we're going to do
94:53 - is for the top one we're going to say
94:56 - we're going to target the card
94:59 - and i'm going to say give it a margin of
95:00 - 10 pixels
95:02 - david rakosi is in the chat now oh damn
95:05 - dude
95:05 - what's up he's a crazy student inside of

95:12 - david let's go david has a few builds
95:15 - for you guys already built
95:17 - we're either going to be delivering it
95:18 - live or dropping it as a video
95:20 - this week hopefully so really excited
95:22 - about that
95:24 - and paul nowhack
95:27 - came in hot uh and just
95:30 - dropped uh
95:34 - poland ten poland
95:37 - and he goes you are the best greetings
95:39 - from poland thank you so much
95:42 - nice oh scripting like hiro just said i
95:45 - watch your tutorials and i got a job in
95:47 - my city thank you
95:51 - wow that is beautiful guys we're trying
95:53 - to get to
95:54 - 10 5 000 developers 5 000 people
95:59 - getting jobs as developers that's our
96:01 - number one goal this year in 2020
96:04 - so that is amazing we should have like a
96:07 - counter going seriously like at the top
96:09 - and it should always
96:10 - be increasing every time we find out you
96:11 - guys either get a client or a job
96:13 - but this one is going to be one of them
96:16 - that would be awesome we should
96:17 - definitely do that or on the pwj website
96:19 - or something have like a live counter
96:23 - yeah so right now you can see that image
96:27 - is huge
96:28 - right so i don't want it to be the one
96:30 - at the bottom this one here
96:32 - yeah and there's actually a few and
96:33 - they're in a row right now but you just
96:35 - can't see it
96:36 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
96:38 - i'm going to say
96:40 - card image and i'm going to go ahead and
96:41 - style this so let's go back to half and
96:43 - half and then we do this we say
96:46 - card image and i'm going to say oh nice
96:48 - object
96:50 - that works whatever you didn't just work
96:53 - so object fit fill and that should do
96:55 - that for us now
96:57 - and what i'm gonna then do is go ahead
97:00 - and do
97:01 - um i am now gonna go ahead and do so 300
97:06 - pixels min width
97:07 - min height of 200 pixels and yep 100
97:11 - and then i'm going to go ahead and say
97:13 - for the card component
97:14 - itself we're going to say that it should
97:17 - have the following properties so let's
97:18 - go ahead and add
97:20 - this in so i'm gonna go ahead and add in
97:23 - a margin of 10 pixels
97:24 - a border of zero pixels and a solid
97:26 - black
97:27 - so this is very important because this
97:29 - actually gives it it gives it
97:31 - zero so we don't actually need that one
97:32 - we can give a border radius of 10 pixels
97:34 - you see you get the rounded corners
97:36 - right the overflow is hidden so that if
97:38 - i don't have overflow hidden here guys
97:40 - you'll see even if i round the corners
97:42 - you see what it did like it just gets it
97:43 - doesn't do it as we want it
97:44 - you want to make sure overflow is hidden
97:46 - then you do box shadow
97:48 - now this box shadow gives it that 3d
97:49 - effect we're doing a transition a
97:52 - transform and this will actually come in
97:54 - because we're going to add a hover
97:55 - property here
97:56 - so let's go ahead and add this in and
98:00 - now what you can see is if cause if you
98:02 - go ahead and hover over those cards
98:05 - i'll do that right now oh nice they got
98:09 - the little feel to it
98:11 - yeah but i think they're doing it yeah
98:13 - go ahead
98:14 - the reason why we did we get the sort of
98:16 - animation with it is because we added in
98:19 - transition transform 100 milliseconds
98:22 - which says that that that animation
98:24 - should actually take
98:25 - 100 milliseconds if i get rid of that
98:28 - let's go ahead and check out what it
98:29 - does
98:30 - as you can see it's very snappy ugly
98:33 - yeah you don't want that you want that
98:35 - silky buttery smooth transition
98:37 - oh silky buttery smooth dude
98:40 - like that almost like releases some
98:41 - taste in my mouth when you say those
98:43 - words
98:46 - you know you're not the first one who
98:48 - said that somebody else actually said
98:49 - that in a coaching call they were like i
98:51 - wha what really made me get inside of
98:53 - pwj is when you said that the buttery
98:55 - smoother animations
98:56 - and i was like oh [ __ ] you might you
98:59 - just start saying that just like
99:00 - random times like all the times actually
99:05 - um also and 0.1 is gonna also do the
99:08 - same thing too right
99:09 - 0.1 seconds that should be 100
99:10 - milliseconds
99:12 - yeah exactly okay dope so let's leave it
99:16 - like this
99:19 - nice right now what we're gonna do
99:23 - is we have those things uh and the good
99:25 - thing is guys is that here it's doing it
99:27 - very clever so let's go ahead and make
99:29 - this
99:29 - uh make it big big now kazi no it's how
99:32 - it's gonna use up
99:33 - this is really awesome uh the greatest
99:36 - ever said something really nice and he
99:38 - goes
99:38 - seren calden he was talking to sarin and
99:40 - he goes yeah these guys may not even
99:42 - realize just
99:43 - how valuable they truly are and just how
99:46 - much
99:46 - more value they're sharing as opposed to
99:48 - what they think
99:50 - they're doing for us so yeah like
99:53 - right like we're we're putting in the
99:55 - effort for you guys we're making this as
99:57 - valuable as possible but
99:58 - for the right people and it goes both
100:00 - ways right because we can give you
100:03 - value but also how much value do you
100:06 - pull and extract out of it so we love
100:08 - having people like the greatest ever in
100:09 - our community who are like
100:11 - really feeling like they're getting
100:13 - their money's worth and a ton of value
100:15 - out of it so
100:16 - exactly exactly that guys cozy go ahead
100:20 - and make the airbnb
100:21 - so the localhost a little bit bigger and
100:23 - notice how it grows now
100:25 - um yeah let me go ahead
100:29 - oh this one right here yeah oh to make
100:32 - that nice dude
100:33 - but if you grab the actual edge of the
100:35 - screen and just start pulling it
100:37 - you'll notice that like you get a really
100:38 - nice sort of uh so look at that oh
100:41 - look at that that is nice
100:44 - yes it looks really slick yeah dude i
100:47 - love that
100:48 - that is excellent yes we get that sort
100:51 - of responsiveness
100:52 - frank says cozy making the buttery
100:54 - smooth thing weird now
101:01 - nice so now what we're gonna do
101:05 - that's funny all right keep going we're
101:08 - going to basically for the card info
101:11 - we're going to go ahead and do the
101:12 - following so we're going to say margin
101:13 - top minus 9 that'll pull the margin up
101:16 - for
101:16 - the uh info on the text and then we're
101:19 - going to say
101:20 - border radius of 10 pixels padding 20
101:22 - padding top 20
101:24 - and margin uh a border 10 a border of
101:27 - one
101:28 - right let's go ahead and add those
101:30 - things and then the c
101:32 - and now what i'm going to do is i'm
101:33 - going to talk i'm going to style the
101:34 - text inside
101:36 - right so i'm going to start with the
101:36 - text so we've got a h2 and h4 inside
101:40 - so inside of card.js we've got a h2 and
101:42 - h4 the title in the description
101:44 - so making the font size uh 18 pixels
101:47 - font weight of 600
101:48 - and the h4 font size of 14 font weight
101:51 - of 300
101:52 - margin top of eight margin bottom of
101:53 - eight as well so let's go ahead and save
101:55 - that
101:56 - now you can see you get a much nicer
101:57 - look and feel to it so that looks really
101:59 - clean
102:00 - um now with that
102:04 - said let me go ahead and just check
102:06 - something so
102:08 - let's go ahead and cause it you zoomed

106:17 - let's go ahead and scroll down quasi
106:20 - yep i'm gonna go ahead and scroll down
106:24 - on our app or the code yeah

106:28 - at the bottom we've got the footer pop
106:30 - in
106:30 - so are we now working on the footer yeah

106:44 - so far but
106:45 - let's go ahead so for the footer we're
106:48 - going to add the following styling
106:50 - i just added a foot emoji on the title
106:54 - nice so here what we're going to do is
106:57 - we've got the footer so here we're going
107:00 - to say border top 1 pixel solid light
107:02 - gray
107:03 - padding of 20 pixels background color of
107:05 - white
107:06 - it's like a gray off gray the bottom
107:08 - zero so it's gonna stick to the bottom
107:10 - uh and then we're gonna say text align
107:12 - center uh here we don't actually need
107:14 - bottom zero
107:14 - text line center and then for the uh
107:16 - we're gonna target the p tags so that
107:18 - text we're gonna say padding of five
107:19 - pixels font
107:20 - size of fourteen so now if we scroll
107:22 - down qazi
107:24 - we should see the the bottom so that
107:27 - footer
107:28 - should actually show us and there we go

108:51 - functionally how do we do routing or any
108:53 - of that stuff

Cleaned transcript:

talking about so i'll just search from 26th to 30th and do this and this is what i got by the way super responsive so it looks amazing and when you say search page you're really referring to this page right exactly yeah exactly what i'm referring to whoa 10 canadian dollars thank you thank you so much that is awesome and we just broke 700 viewers with a 10 donation guys you're the best thank you so much and smash that like button let's keep this rocking and rolling nice let's go guys so the first thing we're going to do is build a home.js component so because if you're going to go ahead and create the first file and then what we can do is i can create it after that but sure thing uh just to show them so what do you home.js exactly nice and once we have home.js we're going to use our nice little trick called rfce and rfce is a is a really handy extension that we it's called es7 react snippets and to get that it's very simple you just go to the vs code extensions type in es7 snippets and it will come up and that will give you that rfce functionality which is nice so at this point what we're going to do is we are going to actually go ahead and give this a class name of home so we give this a class name of home just like this and we are going to go ahead and import the appropriate css file so we're going to say import home.css like this right and obviously with that said we're going to have to go ahead and create the css file so i'm going to go ahead and create home.css and we should be popped in right here so uh i think you have to follow me cozzy so let's go ahead and refollow me there we go so now you guys can see i'm inside of home.css and we've imported it at the top here and that will allow us guys to do a few things that allow us to actually write css which only belongs to the home folder a home component sorry so with that what we're going to do now is we're going to pull this on to you so let's just prove that this is the home we're going to say h1 um oh no my snippets don't seem to work that's fine we can do h1 and here i'm going to say uh home component like this right save this file and i'm going to go back to your app and here we're actually going to pull it in the home component so i'm going to say home like so and what we can do is we need to import the home component so i'm going to say import home from home like this right and save the file and what that will go ahead and do is it should now we should now see on the we should now see on the uh on the right side so let's go ahead and give me one second my itunes is going nuts so just shutting out my itunes and now you guys should be actually good to go oh and i just realized i got my phone as a thing so i'm gonna actually probably use that at some point but for now let's keep going nice so uh let's go ahead and pull up localhost on the right okay so we're gonna do that so we got localhost and the actual final build right here so everybody can see it nice and are we sharing the screen yeah nice awesome so now we've got uh you can see it says home component right so what i'm going to go ahead and do just prove this we're going to get rid of the h1 over here and now you should be able to just see home component right so it should be super clean we might need to refresh localhost uh because it doesn't seem to be coming up somebody says sunny check your voice is too low so let me go ahead and turn the gain up a little bit for you guys i'll turn you up a little don't turn your gain up your audio is pretty awesome i'll turn you up here more your audio today is like really clean okay awesome now you're better nice so now what we're going to do is we are actually going to go ahead and build out the home component so the first thing we want to build inside the home component is um the actual before we do that so we actually added the home component but we actually want to always show so think of it this way the header component is actually going to live in both the home and the um the search page right so it's going to exist in both of these things so what we can do is we just built the home component but we're actually going to go ahead and build the header component and this is always going to show so let's go ahead and add this in right here right here so yeah what we need to do is create header.js so header.js and we should snap into that file in a second uh let's go in it's just loading so we're now inside the header.json we'll do rfce and we're inside and i'm going to do class name equals header like so and we're going to do import header.css and then i'm going to go ahead and do header.css so we've created a header.css file as well and you should see me snap in any second now there we go so we're inside and inside of the header file let's go ahead and start sort of drafting out what it's going to look like so the header file has an image tag so i've actually gone ahead and grabbed an image and this is just an image of the um the uh airbnb logo so let's go ahead and pop this in here and what we're going to do is you can see i've given it a class name of header underscore underscore icon so this is bem this is header component and it's the icon element so that's why we've done this and now we should actually go ahead and see that if we okay so it's freaking out because we haven't imported it so we need to go ahead and import it here so we can say header like this save the file and we should now see a massive airbnb logo right so obviously we don't want it to be that big it looks a bit ugly when we have it like that so so how do we get that to look a bit smaller right so we go to header.css and we basically are going to target the header icon so we're going to target the header icon and i'm going to say give it an object fit contain so this is going to keep the aspect ratio so it doesn't stretch i'm going to say the height is 100 pixels so now you can see it's a very small size and then we're going to go ahead and give it margin left of 80 pixels so that should push it a little bit from the side so let's go ahead and decrease this a little bit for now so let's just say 20 pixels to make it a little bit subtle and we have the image tag up and running so that's all handy and that's done now we're going to create a div for the center stuff so that that search input field that you see and the header right so let's go ahead and pull out the deployed version quasi so this is a deployed version yep so this is the deployed version and you can see it in the middle of that deployed version so that's actually going to give it half and half uh so because right now it's still quite stretched there we go so you can see in the middle of the the top bar we have that search input field so we're going to go ahead and build that first and then we're going to add a header right section which is which has those uh icons that you see on the right so hold on so in the in the header this is going to be one so i'm just imagining this this is one container that will just keep the logo and that one container has only one child yeah so this is really good by the way guys because my css skills suck so it's good because if you're a beginner in css you'll pick it up this way too i imagine this is one container with two children one is the search input and one is the search icon exactly nice okay dope and then we got another one here and this has four one container with four children text logo icon icon icon yep exactly and the middle container we're going to apply flex 1 to it so it's actually going to span all of that gap that you see in the middle so this is going to apply flex 1 and so hold on let me get this straight so this container here is actually really like this right yes exactly nice and that happens when you do when you do flex one exactly so it's giving that the importance and then the the ones on the right and left are only taking up as much space as they need exactly that now another question for you sunny how do they know to be centered how does airbnb logo know to be kind of centered you know what i mean like why isn't it left aligned so what we do is we say that the um header so we say that entire container should be display flex which will pop everything into a row and then what we say is align item center and that will align everything centrally ah so this is because of align items uh center something like that yep exactly dope okay dude this is actually a really cool way for me to learn yeah it's nice okay and when you do a line item center it will center every single one of these items in the entire header we're applying a line item center to the header yeah so the actual um we're applying it to the direct children of the parents so that they had a parent so we should make sense when we do it but what will happen is for that middle one for example that will have its own display flex and then that will have to have its own align item center got it so every single container has to behave you have to give the rules to that container so um yeah we'll be able to show it out but that's a really good example of a line item center beautiful okay okay let's keep going nice so with that said what we're going to do now is go over to here and we're going to create a div so i'm going to go ahead and do div um so let's make a div and this div oh man why is he snipping this no i'm going to say div class name equals and then here i'm going to do header center right so this will be header center and it's being a bit laggy so this is actually going to go ahead and do this so header center and here we're going to have two things we're going to have an input typed as text so here's going to have an input type as text and a search icon now it's going to freak out because this search icon i mean where are we getting this from right so in order to get the search icon we're going to have to pull in material ui so let's go ahead and actually do that at this point so kazi let's head over to materialui.com and show them how to install material ui core and material ui icons yep so you guys make sure when you're at material ui grab this come back to your command line i'm gonna just open up a new one and then install this how you install core now i'm gonna go here type in icons and um in the mean and then also i think install core really fast damn and then over here choose icons because my download is what 900 900 download speed actually right now 900 megabits nice uh so make sure you also install icons you'll need this on this page make sure you click here which says search the full list of icons and yeah until somebody finds a better way to do that and then go in here here are all your icons so for example when you guys are looking at these icons here right um whoops there we go so sunny has this avatar icon at the top right i i can probably did you actually pick it from here uh no so the avatar is actually a component because you can pause something but let's look at the globe for example okay let's type in globe okay there we go yep so that's coming from right there dope and then what about that drop drop arrow drop arrow that's that's actually if you type in uh i think it's if you type in down down or something yeah there we go another is that one that one expand more it's expanding yeah that's it right there and then yeah i mean everything else oh the search is i mean obvious so then what sunny would do is once he finds search right here we got search we match it up to that one dope now click here this will give you the actual code you can copy it paste it into your app and you're good to go exactly and then that's how when you see me using snippets like search icon language i can expand more icon that's where we're getting them from right so if you do get confused at any point you can be sure to check out material ui the icon search tool all right i'm gonna give you access i'm gonna give you read and write access to both terminals as well awesome nice so with that said guys this search icon is freaking out right now because it doesn't know where to pull it from so let's go to the top of the file import the search icon like that and that will actually go ahead and it should save the file and we should have the search icon so you can see now everything by default is display blocks which means it stacks up on top of each other we don't actually want that behavior right so in order to get rid of that what we can do is we can go here and we can say header and we can say display flex so if i do this display flex check out what happens as soon as we hit save everything goes into a row so you can now see that the airbnb and the top has gone into a row let's go ahead and remove that home component let's just comment that out for now so it gets a bit confusing there we go so inside of the header now we've got the search icon and we've got an input field text input field yeah so what we're going to do now is also remember we said you have to treat every single container with its own rules so in order to do that we can target the header center say display flex and look what happens when i do this guys so if i say display flex align item center like this look how the uh search icon is now central center with the input field so that's really clean and that's the way that you do that all right now what i'm going to also do is go ahead and add a the right section so the right section i'm going to go ahead and do a div and this div is going to have a class name of let's go ahead and say header underscore right there we go and here i'm going to go ahead and add in a few things it's going to have a p tag so this p tag is going to say become a host because that's what they have on airbnb and for those of you who don't actually know what airbnb is it's a place where you can pretty much rent out a room it's like a hotels of booking website um so yeah so that's where you can become a host as well so we're gonna import the two icons at the top so you've got language icon expand more icon and also this is not an icon but it's it's a component called avatar now that's how we achieve that sort of circular profile image a very very powerful component you can actually pass it a source we use it in a lot of other builds so be sure to check that out but what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and pop in those three icons here like so so i'm going to go ahead and do this and now we should see those things pop in and now you can see in the header right container you as you guessed it it's display block which means they stack up on top of each other by default we again don't want this behavior so what we can do is we can say header right we can go ahead and write and then what we can do is we can say uh header right display flex display flex like this right now if i go ahead and do this we can go ahead and save it and you should be able to see everything goes into a into its own line right now if again let's stick with our rule let's do a line item center and we will be able to see again that everything goes center central with each other which is really nice and it's a really good way of doing this now for the header what we're going to do is we're going to space out those components components as much as they can go so we're going to say justify content space between and that will actually push the components apart as far as they can go from each other and then for the central element remember we said that we want that center one to take up as much room as it can so we're gonna go ahead and give that a flex one rule and that will do that and you can't actually see what this is doing unless we actually make it a little bit bigger but you need to trust at this point so cause let's go ahead and make it a little bit bigger now you can see the input field is actually taking up the majority of that room but it doesn't look like it right now right so it actually doesn't look like it and the way we fix this right now is we're going to add a few things in and in order to do that uh what we need to do at this point is firstly we need to go ahead and do the following so we're going to say align items center which we've done so let's go ahead and do that first align item center at the top uh william cruz again with the um five i think that's uh what was that one he always says it every time i can't remember but thank you so much for that donation massively awesome i always actually i call it the chief keef donation but i forget what the chf man every time swiss franc how in the world does chf stand for swiss franc bro but thank you so much that is huge yeah i always get lost to that one i wish it had a better acronym like sf swiss franc that would be so much easier but thank you brother i appreciate it absolutely appreciate that so nice so now what we're gonna do is let's go ahead and do the following so for the uh header we're gonna go ahead and add the following rules so i'll explain each of these ones as we do it so we're doing a line item center we're doing position sticky and what we're doing here if when we do position sticky with the top of zero what this does is if you go to the deployed app kazi and let's go ahead and scroll down on the deployed app so let's open up the deployed app and let's scroll down can you notice how the header is actually sticking to the top yeah i can see it's very yeah yeah so it does that because we've done position sticky and then top zero so it sticks to the top and that's how we get it to look like that now an important rule that we have to add is the z index so you have to say z index of 100 100 because and if we gave something else like 99 we want it to be going to be like sort of on top of everything else so it covers everything we're going to give it a background color of white which is what we see and expect and a width of 100 because we want to span the entire width so that's going to do that for us the next thing we want to do is we've already started the header icon which is awesome we want to basically william cruz says the best of the best you both are amazing sunny would be nice to see you working with react native challenge accepted dude we will get on to that and we will start building something really native i haven't used it in a while so i mean we can definitely i'm excited to go back into it i know people are asking what happened yesterday because i wasn't on the live stream i was i shared like my dog got hurt so um i'm gonna share some of that with you guys so this is actually our puppy her name is pudgy and she ended up like really breaking her nail pretty bad so that's why yesterday we had to go to the er frankie ended up taking over the stream uh then we were waiting at the um at the vets for hours and here that's my girlfriend that's amber lee that's pudgy right there she was pretty hurt and then we pretty much got her back and this is this is what she's up to now so you can see she's passed out she got a little like cast on her arm right there and yeah got a call so she can't bite it off but yeah she's getting big really really fast um dude it's horrible when you see a little one like a little dog sort of injured that's crazy they gave her a little car yeah a little like tiny cone she's so adorable she's probably playing with it like she's just sitting there like she's out of action with her crazy stuff was going on man and then yesterday like our freaking whole alarm like our sewage system like making crazy sounds and stuff and then releasing smell i'm like what is happening can we just get back to coding good damn it man at least we are back guys and i think that deserves to smash your thumbs up man yeah guys if you yeah for the little puppy you know yeah go ahead and smash that like button thank you people are saying blessing her a you says blessing for her courtney says beautiful dog she's a english bulldog she's four months old so to see her and then like the nail got broken so they had to like actually pull it out completely so that's why they put the cast on top of it yeah but uh yeah other than that let's keep in rocking and rolling now i'm back and ready to go guys and we're here and let's crush it so what we're gonna add now for the center is we're gonna say give it a max width and fix uh and fit the content so let's go ahead and do this so fit content like that and what we're going to do is boom and here i'm going to give it a bit of styling so we'll say panning at 10 pixels a height of 30 pixels so let's go ahead and do that save the file and you can now see that it should change a little bit uh oh oops i've added that's the wrong thing we should add it over here there we go add it to the header center and that will actually go ahead and pad that out a little bit now for the top right so the center element we're gonna go ahead and give it a border radius of 999 which is a perfect oval we're going to give it a one pixel solid light gray board and you can see now it's got a so very subtle light like sort of um light gray border around the top but we don't want that input field to actually have the border around itself so what we need to do is target it like this we say header center the direct charge which is an input and we're going to say border none so we're going to go ahead and do border none and what i'm going to do at this point is i'm going to say width of 250 pixels like this and now guys you can see if we go ahead and do this so actually at this point we'll keep it responsive let's go ahead and get rid of this for a second but what we can actually say is we can say um let's leave it as width 250 for now uh let's go ahead and do that and then on the header right what we're going to do is we're going to say justify content space between those icons we want to give some space between them we're also going to give it a width of 15 view it and a margin right of 80 pixels so i'm going to go ahead and do that right now and this will go ahead and it should space it out a little bit more and there we go so let's go ahead and do this for now because let's actually make it a big screen uh sure think boom there we go nice now you guys can see everything is spaced out evenly we've got a nice little bit of spacing and what you can do at this point for desktop support you can do a width of 250 pixels and you see the middle goes into that but for now to keep it super responsive i'm going to actually comment now so let's go ahead and do half half again nice and what we're going to do now is for that input field what i want to actually say is give it a padding of 10 pixels and then outline width of 0. and what this does guys is now because if you go ahead and click the input field damn effort just dropped five pounds he says damn you guys are just awesome enough said hope you make a web app with an admin interface someday i've actually heard a lot of people say that so we will go ahead and actually make some kind of admin crud functionality app or something by the way i figured out finally how to actually increase the size of this thing that was thanks to leif i was on the coaching call for a profitable shortcut and he was like dude you can increase the size of this and i'm like oh oh nice that makes life so much easier so yeah thank you efosa really appreciate it and yeah this is another reason i actually really like django as a web framework because it comes in with a badass builtin admin interface which is so freaking nice too but i think a django and react combo could be really fun that would be awesome dude because i want to learn a lot of django that would be awesome to do that nice so kazi go ahead and click the input field yep and now can you see there's no blue outline right you don't get any blue out there but if i if i actually uh comment out the outline width uh oh no oops i'm on the wrong corner if i go and comment out the outline with this one and we now do can you see you get that nasty outline right yeah kind of defeats the entire ui so what you need to do is outline width of zero and that actually gets rid of it and now it just looks plain yeah and that's how you get that sort of desire right and it's a boolean type of thing right so whether you have zero and one that's the same even if you had a hundred it'll be the same exactly yeah okay dope yeah so that we're gonna switch to zero and then you'll be able to get that so that's really clean and with that said the header is pretty much done at this point right so the header at this point is done uh which is awesome so now we can actually go back to the uh app.js file and we can see that we've got our header over here and now we're going to focus on the home component right so let's go back into home and previously we had this where we said home components let's go ahead and see now you can see the home component renders in underneath um underneath the the header now i can see some people have just completed the google clone that's awesome yeah i love seeing people that oh damn louise eduardo just dropped 20 us dollars wait hold on hold on whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa damn thank you so much luis eduardo really appreciated holy crap you guys i mean yesterday i had to pay 400 for my dog so this is actually helping out you know this actually thank you so much really appreciate it that's insane thank you so much wow somebody said we have 20 dislikes on the video so i think he paid 20 dollars to make up for all those dislikes nice appreciate it appreciate that dude so with that said let's go to the home.js component right so what we're going to be building next is a fun component is the banner right so that really beautiful banner that we see so to get that banner up and running let's go ahead and create banner.js so i've just created that file and we should pop into it in just a second and we are in that file now and if i do rfce and the snippets should load there we go and we can see banner and then just do our little setup so we say class name equals banner and at the top of the file i'm going to go ahead and import oops import banner dot css there we go save the file and it's going to complain because it doesn't have a banner.css so let's go ahead and create that file oh we just got another donation dude by x i'm gonna i'm gonna bring that in a second but jose said qazi i just wanted to say that your content is the best out there actually spending the time to read and see your sts stats result uh see your results as speechless thank you clever programmer of course guys we're reading every single message and we're trying to respond to every single uh message as long as you guys are actually putting in the time and asking good questions we will reply to most of people and thank you so much ex lilu for the six pound donation holy crap euro six euro donation and he goes uh awesome hi qazi and sunny in the future do you have any responsive mobile project or a tutorial on how to use media media queries and react what are you thinking sunny dude we just got another one i'll let that pop in when you see that but yeah we are going to be doing a responsive oh my god we'll definitely be doing we'll definitely be doing uh some builds with media queries so stay tuned for that and you guys know you guys know that song on tick tock i should be playing that here remind me actually to put that on after this frankie but like that one goes what you do you have you heard that on tick tock ever yeah [Laughter] that is a 10 pound donation and he says waiting to see a facebook clone and we will be making a facebook clone with every option including live and marketplace tech one react with typescript sunny typescript is coming up i know you're gonna enjoy it two redux three apollo four graphql and five docker damn bro i think you might be asking a lot for ten dollars bro i think you're pushing it now but we'll try we'll try to add some of the things in there but thank you bro no pressure no pressure guys so with that said we've got we got holy [ __ ] they're gonna start asking for blood from me yeah bro just right now yeah yeah oh right for brother so inside of the banner component now it says banner is not defined and that's because inside of here we need to do an import so let's go ahead and say import import architect i've got a new keyboard import banner from banner.css there we go save that somebody else's message they're like could you make an app that includes react graphql scikit learn and tensorflow like damn holy [ __ ] so it's freaking out if we if you give it an empty thing right it's going to stop freaking out so this would just say hello for now something like that and then it will actually go ahead and not give you an error so it should be working completely fine once we put that in and it saves and refreshes um let's go ahead and refresh logos quasi all right i will go ahead and refresh localhost 3000. oh oops i've done it wrong this should be banner here should be sorry import from banner that's why that was happening inside of here we do import from banner css that's nice so there we go we've got hello i'm let's just just say i am banner okay i am the banner now what we're going to do is i love how people actually spot that out as well like it shows how much you guys are watching it's insane to see that yeah seriously yeah like when i see people like you forgot an import i'm like holy crap they're really like nailing in on that so now inside of banner.js we're going to have a few things right we've got the search so we're going to ignore the search just for now but for the info right so the actual banner itself let's get that looking the way that you've that the majority of it that you see i found it i found it so i'm just going to show it real quick uh i was trying to spend some time looking for it uh and i found the song in the compilation uh this is what it is let me play it actually real quick hopefully it doesn't blow your ears guys be prepared be prepared oh god yeah i can't hear it i mean uh it's i don't know how this trend started it's all about like splashing water on people and oh yeah yeah yeah i've seen a few people did it yeah but i love that song that i love jesus christ yeah so you guys can look that up it's called what you doing with that yeah i'll definitely clip it and have it in our videos playing next time no sean dawn says great what you guys do i made the netflix and google watching your video thank you yeah pretty sick names oh damn yeah sean dean maybe yeah oh damn it david jonathan said that wasn't sound wait are you serious yeah i might have not actually came through on the sound i think the sound was there but it might have been too quiet let me let me try it one more time i think it should be good guys someone jumps in like is this the place where we learn reaction did somebody say that no i'm just imagining oh yeah yeah no no the audio is there i mean audio should be there you guys all right all right let's keep coding my bad but yeah that's where the song comes from so now what we're going to do is we have the banner and we want to basically get this to a point so let's go ahead and put the banner over here we've got banner.css and just going to target the banner and what i'm going to say here is that the banner should have a height of 50 view height so this is going to be pretty much say it's got 50 percent of the screen that's going to be its height right so we're going to say that we want to be position relative because we're going to have some things positioned inside of it and we want to do some funky stuff with that and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to set the background to an image right so the background of this i'm going to set it to an image and this background i'm going to set it to is actually an image of like a sort of airbnb looking building right so let's go ahead and do this and save it and now you can actually see if we go ahead and actually make that a bit bigger quasi so let's go ahead and make that a bit bigger we should be able to see why is it looking like oh yeah oops so we've got that right now you can see the image is there but it's not centered right so all we need to do is add these two lines at the end saying center center and this will center it horizontally vertically and you can see boom there you go you get like a very nice centered image yeah so that's really cool looks super clean let's go ahead and do half half again nice and what we're going to do now is where it says i am a banner you notice how it's the background of the div that we actually set right so i'm going to actually go here and change this now so we actually have inside of it i'm going to have not i am a banner but i'm going to create a div so i'm going to say div and this div is going to have a class name so i'm going to say class name and this is going to be banner info right so it's going to be banner info and this is going to be responsible for the text that you see so that black block of text that you guys saw in the previous uh build so what we're going to have inside of here is a h1 which says get out and stretch your imagination the reason why we don't i didn't think of that that was what was on the website that's what's actually on the airbnb website and then we're going to have a h5 um i think you're muted quasi yep very good no i know but i wasn't talking oh yeah i thought i saw you talking to the camera nice oh no no i was just i was just staring everybody down in the live stream making sure they were they knew i was paying attention and watching them nice so now you can see let's go ahead and refresh localhost because there's some reason it does this when we pair program um let's go ahead and refresh quasi localhost 3000 and then what we're going to do is we are going to have so now you can see it says get out and stretch your imagination here's some good comments by the way i just want to shout them out malwaniki says after trying tons of boot camps i found my yoda you guys are the best and robert says thanks your streams and videos are great keep going guys learned a lot from you nice and you know what guys even if you're a beginner just follow along with the builds and i say this even to the students inside the course follow along with these builds it's pattern recognition just by following along with the build every single time you start to pick this stuff up naturally like if you go along with every single build it's impossible not to learn right so go ahead and make sure you do that and you guys will naturally pick up these skills nice so with that said let's actually go ahead and add an explore nearby button right so let's go ahead and add that button in so let's go ahead and do it here so say button and it's a capital b because we're using the material ui button so we need to go ahead and import that at the top of the file let's go ahead and pop down at the top and then here i'm going to say explore explore nearby oops explore there by like this and then i'm going to go ahead and give this a variant so i'm going to say this is a variant of outlined so material ui allows you to pass props to its components this one changes the look and feel of that button so the explore button you can't actually see it very well but you can actually see it now and there buttons in the chat hey she goes sorry fashionably late the girlfriend's always supporting nice and so now we've got explore nearby um and now what we're going to do is actually go ahead and style this banner info so it looks a lot nicer than what we're seeing right now right so let's go ahead and do banner on the squad score info and let's do this a balance for info oops info and let's actually go ahead and change the background color of this to black so let's change the background color to black and let's do this so we're going to say color of white as well so change the color because now we remember we just set the background color to brown to black so the text is also going to be hidden so we need to make the color white and you can see now we can see that the color of that stuff right so um now what we're going to do is now so let's go ahead and do color white and what we're going to do is we're going to add some padding right so these are different values we're going to be using i'll run you guys through what each one is so padding top i'm saying give it 25 padding top i want padding left 50 pixels padding right 50 pixels padding bottom 40 pixels um and then i'm going to say the width should be 300 pixels max right so the width of 300 pixels and that will actually tie in a little bit and now what's really nice about this design guys is that if you actually go ahead and make this uh bigger kazi we should be able to see that this will actually it's a very nice sort of overlay right so let's go ahead and make it bigger you see it like it kind of looks pretty neat how it's in there right um so you can kind of get that thing and then like yeah it looks super neat by the way ramraj says please consider adding tracked module in the pwg course what's tracked maybe he misspelled react i don't know yeah i think he might be talking about react inside the pwg course we actually do have a bunch of content we have a loads of coaching calls on inside the course and we're actually dropping some modules on react so everything is going to be inside that course yeah and apparently ashish uh enjoyed marabon and sunny's dance video on savage love on tick tock hey nice quit getting that clout damn yeah there we go all right so because do you teach hacking oh man if you if you consider debugging hacking let's go yeah right so now what we're going to do is we're going to change the style of that button right so let's go ahead and target the buttons we're going to say banner info the direct child which is a button and i'm going to go ahead and do background color and i went and actually saved you guys some time and i found the color of airbnb which is this right here so if we do that you can see the button pops in right now i you can see by default material ui give makes everything uppercase for some weird reason so to get rid of that you do text transform inherit and i'll get rid of that uppercase oh just got another donation by manav aurora i think i've seen him in a few of these videos awesome he says pwa or react native what will be great for a project depends on what you're doing dude so pwa is progressive web app i'd recommend go with that until you need a native app and i love what ram raj is saying he goes i'm loving the pwg course already way to go thanks for the awesome content and i actually want to share something pretty epic that happened in uh in pwj yesterday actually so i'm gonna show that also i know i know i know i know i will i will i i will address that in just one second i'm gonna lose my [ __ ] actually so i'm actually trying to hide that for myself for just one second so i can show this because we have bunch of awesome things to show you guys uh where did he post it where did devon post it trying to find uh let me actually try this uh okay let's try this here we go here we go awesome so i just found it right now i'm gonna full screen this and hopefully you guys should be able to see this so devin is our student in profit with javascript and he goes i'm not normally used to posting stuff about myself uh this is devin by the way he was coming on the live streams as well he goes but i know it's important to share wins so i'm sharing mine while i have them first of all i love my new job it's my first sixfigure job and i'm learning so first of all damn devin congrats on your first sixfigure job and he goes and i'm learning a lot of different things that i don't ever get to practice when i work for smaller companies i've only been working this job for a little over a week but it's awesome second i just got accepted to the second round of interviews with google yes that google and he goes i am so pumped um when i first joined the group i was working for a mom and pop agency doing wordpress sites making like one third of what i'm making now and i only joined pwj back in june july is there a correlation i'll let you decide i want to thank everyone in the channel for their support because i'm mostly here for the community and it's helped me in a large way dude that is so freaking awesome that is insane dude and look frank is here too on stage nice that's awesome guys if you want to know how to get inside this community link in the description and david is here david is also on the live chat with us right now yeah david's always watching sally guy he was actually in the coaching call yesterday we spoke loads and we'll be working quite closely together so david's awesome dude inside the course yeah and what the hell the greatest ever you should be in the course right now you're the only one left who's our biggest supporter but not joining the course you should jump in so 100 dude that is sick this is for you devon i just played the air horn and that is a massive massive win to be in the second round of training and also kiera robinson is in her round of interviews with google as well and she's in pwj i'm actually coaching her dude oh snap yeah i'm giving a bit of hand with those interviews yeah so she's doing a google interview as well and she reached out to me to get some help on that so yeah that's another student inside the course who's doing google interviews so this is like mindblowing stuff guys like seriously it's insane that the jobs these people are getting like frank even got a sixfigure contract blew my mind like for company and if you guys have heard of sonos then that's the company that he got it for so amazing stuff yeah we're just having massive wins left and right so if you guys are serious about taking your career to the next level guys i'm telling you this jump on this course before we increase the price and just for fairness so all of you know we know that this program is worth over two thousand dollars it because most people send us messages telling us how much this work this program is worth more than the boot camps that they paid for and in about in next week we're going to be doing a challenge for react and during that challenge we're going to be increasing the price of the course and then it's permanently increasing it's going to keep going up so if you find it for less than 2 000 and you're serious about this you should 1 000 join so for all of you who are here just letting you know because i think this would be a good deal for you guys before the price actually goes up in a week or less exactly and guys if you're on the fence and you can't make the decision yeah or like you're just you're tempted or whatever make sure you check out in the in the description we actually are offering a completely free training on the three top mistakes that developers make completely free training go ahead and check that out and and yeah yeah so you guys have the links in the description you guys can go to this page anytime you want and make sure you just check out this video over here for profit javascript this is the page cleverprogrammer.com pwj and it will tell you everything about this program but you guys know you're going to be getting sunny on the program on the live coaching calls you know you're going to be getting nas so it's a brilliant program guys with so much just heart and soul we put this together join it your mind will be blown that's all i can say yeah and guys like i can't stress enough like if you think that you if you enjoy the live streams me qazi nars the entire team frank we put our heart into this this into this program so like everything that we love and we aspire to like to to make an impact in this sort of uh in this community is inside that program so like if you want to be a part of that then just jump in yeah 100 percent let's keep rocking rolling nice with that said guys we were on the banner right so we just added in the text transform inherit line of code which actually changes the button text to lowercase because we don't want it to be super everything like screaming at you right now it's touching the top text so i'm going to do is margin top of 20 pixels font weight of 600 and you'll see that pushes the button slightly away from the um top of the text which is awesome so we want to make sure that that's done also the h5 tags so the one which says plan a different kind of get away to uncover the hidden gems near you gonna go ahead and target that and give it a margin top of five pixels um because we need to actually set up prettier because for some reason priya doesn't do it when we save um which is a bit annoying but will not work bro i think live share causes these problems yeah it's fine we can we can carry them without this one so we've got the h5 and what we want to do guys is when we hover over that button right so right now when we hover over that button it's not very responsive right so um it's gonna actually change to a different color so kazi if we actually go ahead and hover over the explore nearby button um yeah so guys that p that slack group bara just asked do we need to be a member uh of profit with javascript to join the slack group yes you have to be because that the way we keep the quality just incredible in that group is by whoever joins profit javascript gets access to our community as well and i think community is actually one of the best parts of that program so what did you want me to do sonny uh if you just hover over the explorer i saw some people in the comment in the comments saying who's the guy in the back frankie frankie oh yeah guys that's frankie over here uh he's getting some sick shots actually so let me show you guys actually the photo that he just took and uh look at the setup here i mean that looks amazing this is my setup right now to do this live stream this is all we have to do to actually make the make it come true nice dude awesome were you sharing your pho oh nice yeah i see it oh awesome yeah nice dope so yeah that's thank you guys uh so no it's been cause you hovered over the explore nearby button it went black right we don't actually want it to go black because it doesn't look very clean what we're going to do instead is target it so that when we hover over it so when we add this hover attribute it's going to change the background color to white and then the text to so it's basically going invert one second i forgot i'm sorry i keep doing this but i don't want to miss this so i forgot about this comment somebody in the chat reminded me thank you about that but lewis donated five dollars thank you so much and he goes my donation of twenty dollars was for your little dog damn thank you thank you so much he goes this one is for you guys great job let's go thank you lewis thank you lewis that's amazing dude nice so with that said so if you hover over the explorer nearby you'll see the colors should invert now yeah oh nice that looks clean like a crisp little look to that uh and what we're gonna do now is actually go ahead and have so we've done that sort of very nice sort of look and feel to that part what we're going to do is have an actual search button at the top so search prompt which says search dates right so at this point to add that search button i'm going to go ahead add a another div on on top of this on this one we're going to call someone say div like here i'm going to give it a class name so i'm going to say class name last name of banner and this is going to be banner underscore underscore search like this and here i'm going to basically add in a button so i'm going to say a button will exist here and this button will essentially say at this point we're going to say just search dates right so something like this button search dates and what i want to do is i'm going to give it a variant of outline so i'm going to go ahead and do this uh oops i've forgot that we don't have previous i'm going to go ahead and do variant of outlined oops variant of outline like this awesome and then what i'm going to do is give it a class name as well so i'm going to go ahead and say class name of banner underscore underscore search button so we can start this later on so banner search button and with that said it should we should have a button on top and you can see it's actually there it's a little bit difficult to see but it's actually sitting there at the top and it says search dates at the top so that's very clean now we're going to go ahead and style that so whenever we give a material ui class a class we actually need to style it with the important properties so i'm going to go ahead and add the following styles to that button i'm going to say a background color of white i'm going to say the font weight should be 900 and it should have a text transform so to get rid of the uppercase text and we're going to give it the text itself a color of the airbnb pink so that's how we get that look and feel and then what i'm going to say is for the banner search so the actual div surrounding it i'm going to say go ahead and do the following so i'm going to say give it a top of zero so it should be attached to the top give it a display flex so actually let's go ahead and get rid of this one we can do display flex and then we're going to say flex direction column and this will actually span the entire width of the screen so display column and now you should see it takes up the top of the column so you see at the top now we have that search dates and i'm going to get rid of the home component text over there because that's just ugly right now so boom there we go you've got the search dates at the top right so that looks clean but what we want to do now is have it so that when you click search dates we essentially change it so it says search dates and then hide search dates and hide and i have to to demonstrate this go to the deployed version quasi yeah let's go and if you click on search dates so you see it says hide at the top and then it says search dates every time you click the button it changes the state right right so we want to get that functionality and then basically we nice little like a nice little animation when i click it at the top yeah so that's actually already in there at the moment so if you go ahead and go to r1 so that's the reason why we get that is because we're using the material ui button nice okay yeah so that's why we get that one right there so awesome so now what we're going to do is we are going to go to the um search dates and what we've got to do to get this functionality is actually add in a piece of state so the piece of state that we're going to add in so state is essentially just how you write a variable inside of react uh here we're going to have a piece of state which is called show search right and the reason why we're going to do this is because we want this but we want this variable to keep track of if we click that button or not and by default initially when we click it we're going to have false and the reason why we want to do this is because we're going to say if you click it so let's just say for example um whenever it says show search or if so show search is true then i basically want to render out the search element that you guys saw earlier so let's just say show such uh show date picker let's show show date because that's what we're trying to do here um exactly now if we go ahead and say it says use state is not defined we need to import that so we need to import that as such at the top of the file there we go save it and then we should be able to see now if we save that so kazi now if we actually change this to true you should be able to see that it should say show date picker awesome and if i change this to false it goes ahead and it hides that right so now we have some kind of functionality to it right so what we need to do is that button we're going to tie the functionality to that button so i'm going to say on click of that button whenever you click that button i'm going to shoot off an arrow function so it's going to shoot off a function and this is going to say set show search to whatever the opposite of show search currently so if it's currently true it's going to become false if it's currently false it's going to become true so now to show this in practice kazi go ahead and hit the search date button or search yeah search dates and now you can see show date picker there we go so you see we have some kind of functionality to it now right and now that is gonna that basically sets us up for the next part this the next part is essentially building that beautiful date picker that you guys see in the final build which is that really nice all right i'll add that i'll add that to the top so currently we're working on building the date picker yep we're building the date picker at the moment okay i just added that to the top awesome so now what we're going to do is let's go ahead and go to um let's go ahead and actually go to we need to basically we're going to replace this show date picker with some kind of component which looks like this so we're going to have a search component right and this search component should render out to be essentially what we see in the final product so let's go ahead and create search.js so we should snap into that file any second now i've just created a search.js file and boom we are in it and if we do rfce we should get our es7 snippet and let's go ahead and do our normal bem naming convention so we say search let's go ahead and create the appropriate css file so we're going to import from search.css save that create the search.css file nice um by the way we just broke 1 000 likes yeah thank you guys so much for that that is huge and miraban says that if sunny could he would shower with the airpods chris cavern chris thanks so much for the five dollar donation really appreciate you damn and he goes finishing up the hulu shadow clone you did yesterday but wanted to show some love hey that's awesome dude glad you're doing that because yeah the hulu clone was the hooligan was one of the funnest builds i didn't think it would be that fun but it was free if you guys haven't yeah if you guys haven't that's something which like just looks so nice on your portfolio like the hulu clone um it might already be deployed actually so you might have it um is it clone let me go ahead and see if i've got it so i've got the actual link here i can drop it to you and let's go ahead and do it i'll drop it in the code quasi so go ahead and check out that okay boom all right got it so this is the one you guys built yesterday damn it just looks so freaking slick like look at that wow yeah and it's completely uh connected to an api so if you go to the top and you actually go ahead and click because i was wondering i'm like how much accurate dummy text and data did you guys add like holy crap oh wow so if i actually change horror romance it changes yo this build is actually sick kind of regret that i wasn't like here for this build this one was pretty fun yeah like look at how juicy it all looks like even before the even the animations like me and frankie were saying adding those animations changes it from a website to an app yeah yeah true true true yeah that's true so this is the kind this is the kind of app that you guys would see on like a fire stick tv app or something you know like this is the kind of thing that you would be used to seeing as opposed to just a website like you so you could probably build this deploy on some kind of fire stick app and yeah that'd be awesome nice somebody asked luke says why don't you guys work at google guys we're not the guys who work at google we get the guys who work at google at google yeah hopefully in the next one or two years like the probability of somebody asking like how'd you get a job at google like and somebody were like saying clever programmer would be like massive like hey it was a clever programmer exactly nice so with that said let's go ahead and build the search functionality so let's go back to search and here this is where this is going to be an intricate part of it are we building search or date picker yeah uh so we're building the date picker but this is it's part basically the date picker is the search component [Laughter] um okay all right i mean i i don't underst how does that work this is the date picker component yeah right so are we working are we not working on the data picker component then okay okay all right i'll just let you keep going yeah well yeah we are yeah the search component i'm gonna add this in here date picker component there we go all right so um now we've got the i think maybe loves your chair this is this new chair by the way i swear i think i've seen this in the previous ones oh yeah thank you guys by the way this is a brand new chair i just got actually it has a nice little pillow here for me to sleep on look at that you know there's a proper stream of streaming yeah yeah yeah and then it has like this back support thing which is hard to show right now but it's right here this thing right there nice so it has yeah because what was happening with other chair was i couldn't like i couldn't actually sit with my back on it so that was the problem i'm laughing because meanwhile frankie's gone yeah frankie's chair no frankie has a pretty cool chair right this is a mess [Laughter] [ __ ] it works you know yeah you know hey man when you live stream you know you got you need all this i just walk around like this now i don't even let my neck go from here oh man i try to keep my neck glued [Laughter] all right here we go so inside the date picker we need to do a few things right so the thing that actually allows all that date picker magic to happen is um the react date range so i'm trying to kill the laughter inside uh so it's the mpm i uh wait yeah npmi so let's open up the terminal kazi that is my amg thank you dude hey that guy's name is but his name is mine what the hell is going on here i'm rafi oh yeah nice frank goes frankie has he friend goes frankie has the junior dev chair because he has a senior dev chair yeah let's go to the second terminal um okay so second terminal right here type in here npm i i see you yep npm i and then react date range so this one right here and it doesn't matter if you're in that folder or in the actual app folder right yeah it doesn't matter which one well cd anyways bro cause we're gonna forget when we're about to deploy oh damn wait no hold up did i do it oh okay good shot dude good job yeah make sure you're in the right one because otherwise that will be an issue uh it's being super slow it's being super slow right now i was like damn what's going on send me the npm i make sure you're in the right photo guys because that will i don't know my terminals being so slow but who retracted that message damn dude why are they that's funny dude somebody's message just got retracted they're like i don't know what he said but he's like am i the only one who thinks sunny is looking fat today i don't know how people think that you're more jacked than everybody here i'm the one who's actually fat i gotta work on my my belly you know gotta work on it i'm trying to box every day hey like oh my god mma again hey let's go bro yeah doing krav maga which is like an israeli style of mma yeah damn yeah it'd be dope man yeah yeah so i'll show you jiujitsu you can show me some krav maga let's do it dude i'm down i want to learn jiujitsu as well i'll be sick yeah so now guys we're going to import the date range picker so this is like a very handy mpm module that i found um and we've got we're going to import and now you also need to import two other files so these are css files that the guys who made this uh module recommend that you you bring in and this is because basically this is this is going to give you all that styling that you guys saw in the final one that's how the date picker looks the way it looks [Laughter] sharia sharma said try capoeira that'd be fun that's fun and ashish says mma tutorials coming soon yeah and just to see us doing react one day jiu jitsu the next unboxing the day after that that's it nice so we've we imported the date range picker and to use it there's a few things we need to do now right so we need to add two pieces of state and to add those pieces of state it's very simple one is going to be for the start date and one is going to be for the end date so here we just done that so we've added in the start date and date let's go ahead and do yep that's it nice and for the start date we're going to give it a we're just using today's date as the initial value and for the end date we're doing today's date as well now once we've done that we need to actually add in the following object so here we basically say cons selection range now this stuff you don't really need to know why when you do it this way the main thing is is somebody said sonny can't stop laughing at frankie's chair it does make me laugh yeah frankie frankie show us your chair again oh [ __ ] it's because oh [ __ ] what happened here yo who's manning the [ __ ] live chat damn guys it's because you're like this you're like super stern on your jet you know bro i'm not leaving this thing bro i'm just glued to this thing because i've learned my lesson my neck starts breaking after doing the live streams yeah it does it does we need to add this selection range and this is something that they want you to do if you're using this so you need to do section range start date end date and then the key which is just selection i'm not sure what the key is for in this situation but you need to have it so add that in and then we're going to create a function and this function is basically responsible for this function is responsible for when you basically select a date so here we're saying whenever you select a date set the start date to whatever range you selected the start date and then set the end date whatever range you selected the end date now this is all done um by the library itself so we just need to have this function in here and then they handle everything else um so manavaro says are you going to launch any react native course and he just dropped a donation thank you for that thank you um yeah not a react native course at this point but react we're covering so uh yeah so we'll actually be dropping some content on react native very soon nice so we have the search here and now what we're going to do is we are actually going to go ahead and add in the following line of code now this is the date range picker itself so date range picker ranges we basically pass an array with selection range so this one here and that's an object and then on change we pass in our handle select function okay so this is stuff that i would recommend you guys just follow you literally just follow it along you do it as i've written it and everything will just work for you as well inside your project so cozy let's go ahead and open up our localhost and what i'm going to do is i'm going to import the search so import import search from search here there we go and now what we should be able to see is it says use state is undefined okay so you state is not fine we need to go ahead and do this nice save it and now it also says i can't read that it says cannot resolve something what does that say cannot resolve um let me go ahead and pop this in because oh yeah i've got it localhost 3000. nice but but it says cannot resolve date fns oh yes okay so this actually requires something called fns so you need to do mpmi so let's go ahead and pull it up npm i date fns so it's a peer dependency to be honest they should have set the modules up to actually do this for you but you need to do this step guys because you need that otherwise you're going to run into this issue so that's they're bad but it should be fine so now once that installs that should fix this issue for us um okay there we go so now if we actually see it should be loading up for us in a second so nice so now if we click search dates awesome because we go ahead and click search days hey nice it's opening that thing up bro let me refresh and let's click it again boom look at that got yesterday this week damn bro that they built all of that out of the box i was like i don't know why but i was thinking man i'm like sonny must have done a lot of math here to make this stuff work like damn bro i should have just made up some some excuse me like yeah dude you know what to be honest i have built one of these manually at a previous job and guys it's actually a headache to build that so using a package like this is actually really really handy and this one is actually looks beautiful it looks it looks really nice it's a really really good library to use because there's a lot of edge cases that you have to account for when you're doing this guys stop repeating questions in the chat we are gonna block you all right so now we're gonna do is let's go ahead and add in um let's go ahead and add in the following so i need to actually i want to check something actually i wonder if we removed this from underneath here and changed it over here and then we tried it so let's go ahead and save i just want to try something quickly so now if we go ahead and try and click the search dates okay that's pretty clean but it's not as nice as we want all right anyway so going back to the point so let's go ahead and we've added in this the this date picker functionality so we need to style it to look the way that we want it to look right so in order to get it to look like that we need to do a bunch of styling to this thing and in order to do that let's go ahead and do the following so inside of search this target search let's do the following so we're going to say position absolute uh top 35 pixels left 25 width of 100 view it so um because if you go ahead and click on the search dates yo thanks adam whoa what happened to my voice there yo thanks adam for the 79 cent uh pound is it 79 [Laughter] wait are you serious it's like pennies yeah 79 pennies 79 pence it's like it's like you know pounds and pence and dollars and cents oh [ __ ] bro i did not know this thank you for the 79 pence really appreciate it thank you dude so here we're going to do so click on search dates all right boom clicked yep and now as we style it you'll be able to see everything sort of move around as we need it so click leave that open uh what we're going to do you want me to make it half the screen yeah that's too hard enough nice so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to add in boom i'm going to add in this and we're going to make it so now it's saying top 35 pixels from the top left 25 pixels and then width 100 view it let's do half and half kazi for this bit all right i will somebody is like yo if you guys are making so much money why do these little donations impress you guys that's the humility that actually got us here today exactly yeah and that would never change guys like even if somebody sent us one like literally no like thumbs up button yeah hitting the thumbs up button we're so grateful for like it literally doesn't like i remember in the beginning we started up and it was like a four dollar donation and it was like it blew our mind so yeah yeah dude is that what mike pence is he's a one yeah one uh pound one one cent one pounds uh no it's just a bad joke but okay got it nice so now what was this i was talking about this guy like mike pence but i'll just remove it all right so now we're gonna do the we're gonna target the h2 uh which is so right now we don't actually have a h2 element so i'm gonna go back to our search i'm going to add in a h2 which is basically going to be the number of guests so we're going to have that number of guests pop in underneath and then we're going to have number of guests and also we're going to have an input field for the number of guests so here we're going to have an input field for like how many guests you want to have and they're also going to have a button which says search airbnb right so i'm going to add a button so here i'm going to say i'm going to say button and i need to do an import for that and here i'm going to say search airbnb so let's go ahead and do that search airbnb let's go ahead and import that at the top so boom like that save the file and it says people icon is not defined because the people icon is an icon that we need to import from material ui so go ahead and save that hey adam tate just dropped another donation of two pounds he says thanks for taking your evenings up to do this dude you're welcome like it's insane the amount of value that we see you guys like you know thank you bro this guy's working his way up from pants to multiple pens thank you really appreciate it i think the first one was just a feeler you know yeah damn all right thank you bro nice so now what we're going to do is we have the dates popping up so again if you could just click on the search dates button cozy reason why we have to click it is because yeah it refreshes at times so now you can see it says search uh at the moment oh salman fazad uh for faizal has dropped five canadian dollars nice so we'll be coming back to call this later at my own pace just passing by to say thank you hold on let me pop that in let me pop that in okay now cover it so he says we'll be coming back to code this later on at my own pace just passing by to say thank you from everyone by the way we will be coding react native anytime soon of course dude we will be definitely calling react native soon so stay tuned for that and again massive thank you for donating that's it we really appreciate that thank you bro awesome so let's go ahead and do um the h2 yeah so now for the h2 what i'm going to do is i'm going to do this i'm going to copy a bunch of styles in here and i'll explain through what they're doing so as soon as i hit save on this you actually see the style looked a bit different there right and the reason why that happened is because i don't display flex align item center which means that the um we now have that icon so that people icon push to the right so um we now have the pupils uh cause you might need to move our face on the uh on ecam so let's move our face to maybe the center you got it because right now it's covering the number of guests um so so that should be you should go you guys should be obscene now on the drop down it says the number of guests and then it actually has that people icon and then we got that with justify content space between and display flex so now they're spaced apart and we gave it a width of five five nine padding of 10 pixels background color of white position absolute left of zero and top of 380 pixels and the parent well we actually gave it a position relative so that's why it stays in its place so the next thing is i'm just going to go ahead and style the input so the input field is this one here so this one over here and this one i'm going to go ahead and do this so i'm going to say a width of 539 padding of 20 pixels position absolute left 0 height 30 pixels top 420 and border of none so you guys can just go ahead and actually just use these styles and copy us and it will work for you um and that actually drops it down to the next line and that's actually a very nice um uh number sort of that you can now select and it will show you uh and the final thing that we're going to do or not the final thing but i basically now when you click the number of guests because you click on the the number two and you'll see that you'll see that nasty outline so uh not not that one it says number of guests yeah so you get that nasty outline so to get rid of that we add in this we say when we focus make the outline width zero so you can see it's gone now oh that is but now i can't hold on yeah it's definitely gone yeah it's true it's gone but the date picker kind of blends into the page a little bit so i can't see where it's ending but yeah definitely it looks much better yeah so right now that's fine because we will be adding a button which you'll be able to see in a sec so for the button to style we need to do the following we're going to say go ahead and target that button and do the following so position absolute left of zero but top four a text transform inherit and that's because we don't want to be uppercase background color of the airbnb color and then color white and width to 57579 and that will give you the exact perfect dimensions that you guys are going to need and it should do what we want so there you go you've got it looking pretty good but when you hover over so if cars if you hover over search airbnb right now you'll see it kind of goes transparent which is nasty like so the the search airbnb yeah we see that kind of we don't want that we want it to basically invert the colors right so to do so to do that we add this in we say when we hover whenever we hover over it we want to basically do a background color of white and a color text to be that so now if you do it and you hover over that you actually see it so if you click uh hover over search airbnb click it nice now it looks clean you want me to click it uh not yet not yet got it got it because i will click it danny finkelstein says keep up the awesome work guys i will watch this oh snap damn thank you bro for that five dollar donation and say whoa okay nice danny thoroughly tonight hey let's go emotional code coming in with the heavy hidden twenty dollar donation thank you so much and all he said was that's his message to us thank you so much whenever i see like a 20 donation or something i just picture somebody coming in swinging everything's frank seriously yeah this is just epic thank you for that we are at 111 dollars in super chat thank you so much we just broke a hundred dollars and uh you guys are awesome that's insane thank you so much guys let's keep this going all right so now what we're gonna do is we are gonna have it so now we actually have that date picker component looking beautiful it looks really nice but when we click search dates we want to change the text and we want to change that text so that it actually says hide right so how do we do that we go back to banner and here where we had the search dates what we can do here is we can actually go ahead and change this now so that it says the following we can actually say we can do this we can get rid of this right and inside of here what we can do is we can say if show search is true then show hold up text otherwise sunny one second so sunny yeah hold up hold up hold up hold up how do we is there a way we can hide the side bar completely which one the status i think it's the is it the activity bar or the status bar oh you're talking about that blue stuff at the bottom on the lefthand side i think that's the status the on the lefthand side the one that with the file and the icons because the code is getting way too rap like it's getting wrapped up way too much um what we can do you know what i mean like it's looking too goofy now yeah i think we can do like what is this show sidebar i mean i can make it smaller but i think then it becomes really hard to read unless everybody's okay with reading that i think that's okay i think that's okay yeah i think that would be pretty good okay if you guys are okay with that text just let me know otherwise i can change it back yep and thank you so much devon for the five euro donation thank you so much brother i really appreciate it awesome that's nice thank you dude so now what we're going to do is we have the search dates uh added on and if you click on uh the search dates guys you saw in localhost 3000 you'll notice it says hide so it's a search date and then it says hi yeah that's awesome so we have this whoa yeah okay if you make it bigger there you go it centers perfectly so you get a nice like little look to it awesome so now we're gonna do is we're going to make it so that we are actually going no actually at this point i think what we need to do is add in the cards right so the cards are what we see underneath those like those really nice looking cards um and what we need to do is we go to home and essentially what we're gonna do inside of home another epic donation by path re sfl four dollar donation thank you so much my man really appreciate you and guys if like pastor you've also been enjoying this video so far what can they do sonny they can smash the thumbs up button guys make sure it's blue so it's done and yeah we appreciate that it'll get the video out to as many people as it possibly can and it will help more people out there so go ahead and smash that thumbs up button do it guys thank you awesome so with that said guys now what we're gonna do is yeah oh damn dude this is the donations of flying today damn let me let me find it first let me find it oh wow sarin always comes in hot searing just dropped one and what does he say sunny he says sharing is caring thanks guys for sharing your knowledge you guys are helping everyone a lot keep it coming please have this project pushed to get all right okay we'll do it thank you so much nice thank you dude um so now what we're going to do is we have inside of our home uh file what i'm going to do is i'm going to have a a so we're going to restructure this a bit so it says we have a div and this div is going to be called like a section right so it's going to be called so we're going to get a class name and this is going to be called uh home underscore section and what we're going to consider a section is going to be like a row of three cards for example so inside of here we're going to have three of those cards because let's go ahead and open up the actual app so the actual deployed version okay and we should be able to see inside inside the deployed version you can see we've got three cards in a row and then if we go down below we've got another three cards and this is fully responsive so they grow right so you can consider a section to be three cards right so we're going to have two sections um and then basically we're going to make it fully responsive so in this bit here we're going to have a card component which takes a bunch of props and it's basically going to be three so one we're going to hold another section so hold up hold up so one section is going to be three yep all right got it nice so these three and another section t3 dude holy crap what is happening we just got two more donations one by what is bam can anybody i mean all i know is horace is a badass [ __ ] for giving us 195. that's the ban it stands for and frank just sent 20 donation he goes sending some love the work you guys are doing awesome airbnb built thank you frank always appreciate you brother and god damn red we just broke 154 in the super chat this is insane thank you so much frank thank you so much this is insane holy crap nice thank you now damn dude so now what we're going to do the greatest the greatest ever goes frank i knew you were coming it's about that time we should have like suspenseful music start queuing up like later in the stream kind of know yeah frank is coming exactly right so inside of home what we're going to do is i'm going to add in a snippet of code so it says home section and for those sections so those cards that you saw they're going to be inside of a row so it's going to be display flex and you're going to give it a padding of 30 pixels right so each one is going to have a padding of 30 pixels another great donation from shubham pandey thank you so much um we've got home section over here so the card we actually need to create a card component so let's go ahead and do card.js over here i'm going to create a card.js and it we should be inside of it stop it for a second bro and here we go gotem goes i recently completed your reels clone hey uh and he goes and believe me i got an internship in a local agency thank you so much um i think yeah the rules come as well interesting that's nice dude all right that's awesome right so now what we're going to do is we have the card component so i'm going to do rfce like this and then i'm going to create a class name so class name i'm going to do here card and we're going to go ahead and do oops we're going to go ahead and do import card.css like this oh no what did it happen to card.css there we go save the file and then inside of our card so the card is an interesting one it's going to take a few props so props in a functional component appear here so props basically our properties that we can pass the components which make them look different but we can reuse them so this one we're going to destructure at this point and we're going to say it takes a source it takes a title it takes a description it takes a price right and these are the different properties that we're going to be using um for when we reuse the card component which is awesome so now inside of the card what we're going to have is we're going to have an image tag so the image tag is going to basically take whatever prop whatever um source we pass in and that's going to be the source and then i'm going to create a div so we are we're done with the date picker right yeah we're sorry we're done with the day pick and now we're building the card components all right airbnb card components here we go nice awesome i changed it and i'm gonna drop all right and the greatest ever says i just started applying today oh dude that is nice so let me share that real quick he goes i just started applying today and when i get employed i will know for sure that it was because of these amazing lives and the amazing value shared will be sharing that story in pwj chat soon let's go let's go dude that's amazing the greatest ever has been on these live chat every single time yeah we know it's you guys yeah i know hajira i've seen her very often on these live streams um alexandros joins on these live streams quite a bit so thank you guys we really do appreciate you yeah exactly manav i think i've seen a few times there's definitely a few people here which we notice and we see you guys every time so that's awesome now we had the so we're saying uh card is not defined right that's because what we need to do is actually go ahead and import the card so let's go ahead and change this and let's do card like that now it will actually should fix that issue that we're having and inside over here what we can do is it says cannot resolve card.css so i need to go ahead and create card.css and we should pop into that right now uh in a second there we go card.css and now we should get rid of that error so it's all part of getting rid of these errors guys so for the card we have an image right then we have a card info so cars let's go ahead and pop open the deployed version and i'll give you a visual breakdown of what we're actually doing right now so the card info section is actually so you see we've got the image at the top and then underneath it we've got something like i'm just making a div called card info and now that contains the title the description and the price in some cases so if you go to the box oh hold up hold up what's the card it so card info is this here yep all right so that's going to be this title that description and then if you scroll down for the bottom cards they also have a price uh okay got it so boom there we go yeah and the way that we do that is i just popped it in here so we basically render out those things if they exist as a prop nice okay dope yeah and then inside of home so i'm actually saved you guys a bunch of times so i've actually gone ahead and prepopulated some of this stuff with some props so i'm gonna go ahead and swap these out with some properties um that i've basically went ahead and found um it's gonna to do some annoying stuff right now but let's go ahead and format this but what you guys can actually do at this point is go ahead and um you can pause the video and you can pretty much grab these what i've written for these different uh components the props that we're using but if i go ahead and save that now and let's go to our local host yeah so let's go right here nice hey soham just came in clutch thank you so much and he goes awesome guys i have started to learn javascript inspired by your clone videos great content keep up the great work you so much really appreciate it and now we are over 160 dollars thanks to you guys always love and massive massive appreciation for all of you guys and if you guys are enjoying this and you want us to go out to other people make sure you smash that like button so it just keeps going out guys exactly massively appreciate if you guys do that nice so we're going to go ahead and style some of these card components so let's go to our card and for card the css what we're going to do is for the top one we're going to say we're going to target the card and i'm going to say give it a margin of 10 pixels david rakosi is in the chat now oh damn dude what's up he's a crazy student inside of pwj awesome student and it's good to see you dude yo david let's go david has a few builds for you guys already built we're either going to be delivering it live or dropping it as a video this week hopefully so really excited about that and paul nowhack came in hot uh and just dropped uh poland ten poland and he goes you are the best greetings from poland thank you so much nice oh scripting like hiro just said i watch your tutorials and i got a job in my city thank you wow that is beautiful guys we're trying to get to 10 5 000 developers 5 000 people getting jobs as developers that's our number one goal this year in 2020 so that is amazing we should have like a counter going seriously like at the top and it should always be increasing every time we find out you guys either get a client or a job but this one is going to be one of them that would be awesome we should definitely do that or on the pwj website or something have like a live counter yeah so right now you can see that image is huge right so i don't want it to be the one at the bottom this one here yeah and there's actually a few and they're in a row right now but you just can't see it so what i'm going to do is i'm going to i'm going to say card image and i'm going to go ahead and style this so let's go back to half and half and then we do this we say card image and i'm going to say oh nice object that works whatever you didn't just work so object fit fill and that should do that for us now and what i'm gonna then do is go ahead and do um i am now gonna go ahead and do so 300 pixels min width min height of 200 pixels and yep 100 and then i'm going to go ahead and say for the card component itself we're going to say that it should have the following properties so let's go ahead and add this in so i'm gonna go ahead and add in a margin of 10 pixels a border of zero pixels and a solid black so this is very important because this actually gives it it gives it zero so we don't actually need that one we can give a border radius of 10 pixels you see you get the rounded corners right the overflow is hidden so that if i don't have overflow hidden here guys you'll see even if i round the corners you see what it did like it just gets it doesn't do it as we want it you want to make sure overflow is hidden then you do box shadow now this box shadow gives it that 3d effect we're doing a transition a transform and this will actually come in because we're going to add a hover property here so let's go ahead and add this in and now what you can see is if cause if you go ahead and hover over those cards i'll do that right now oh nice they got the little feel to it yeah but i think they're doing it yeah go ahead the reason why we did we get the sort of animation with it is because we added in transition transform 100 milliseconds which says that that that animation should actually take 100 milliseconds if i get rid of that let's go ahead and check out what it does as you can see it's very snappy ugly yeah you don't want that you want that silky buttery smooth transition oh silky buttery smooth dude like that almost like releases some taste in my mouth when you say those words you know you're not the first one who said that somebody else actually said that in a coaching call they were like i wha what really made me get inside of pwj is when you said that the buttery smoother animations and i was like oh [ __ ] you might you just start saying that just like random times like all the times actually um also and 0.1 is gonna also do the same thing too right 0.1 seconds that should be 100 milliseconds yeah exactly okay dope so let's leave it like this nice right now what we're gonna do is we have those things uh and the good thing is guys is that here it's doing it very clever so let's go ahead and make this uh make it big big now kazi no it's how it's gonna use up this is really awesome uh the greatest ever said something really nice and he goes seren calden he was talking to sarin and he goes yeah these guys may not even realize just how valuable they truly are and just how much more value they're sharing as opposed to what they think they're doing for us so yeah like right like we're we're putting in the effort for you guys we're making this as valuable as possible but for the right people and it goes both ways right because we can give you value but also how much value do you pull and extract out of it so we love having people like the greatest ever in our community who are like really feeling like they're getting their money's worth and a ton of value out of it so exactly exactly that guys cozy go ahead and make the airbnb so the localhost a little bit bigger and notice how it grows now um yeah let me go ahead oh this one right here yeah oh to make that nice dude but if you grab the actual edge of the screen and just start pulling it you'll notice that like you get a really nice sort of uh so look at that oh look at that that is nice yes it looks really slick yeah dude i love that that
