08:07 - you know shut up
08:14 - what you gotta have fun with it man come
08:15 - on oh yeah all right
08:17 - all right so where are we at right now
08:20 - explain to us david huh
08:23 - so yesterday we have already built the
08:26 - home page with two products which are
08:29 - actually
08:29 - hard-coded uh and we did an amazing job
08:32 - because we get got started with the
08:34 - header
08:34 - yes then we built the content portion
08:38 - of that a ton of stuff
08:42 - with styled components we learned what
08:44 - is negative margin we learned
08:46 - how to make all these beautiful cards
08:49 - and now it's time to level up
08:51 - anytime level up right there
08:55 - okay beautiful so we got that portion
08:59 - i kind of want this okay so that's
09:01 - awesome now
09:03 - what we have right now guys is we have
09:04 - these they are called static images or
09:06 - they're
09:08 - static products meaning this is not
09:10 - dynamic meaning it's like you have to
09:11 - only put it into the
09:12 - into the actual code in order for us to
09:14 - see the actual products as you can see
09:16 - right here correct
09:17 - but what we want to do now is actually
09:19 - connect this to a database
09:21 - because with a database you know it's
09:23 - dynamic it's able we're able to update
09:25 - things we're able to work on things
09:27 - we're able to go ahead and have the cart
09:29 - automatically update as we are working
09:31 - on this so
09:32 - just any database yes a real-time
09:36 - database
09:36 - exactly so the next thing we're working
09:38 - on right now is going to be what
09:40 - is the following so we're going to work
09:42 - on the database at this point
09:44 - so what i want you guys to do is really
09:45 - quickly guys open up firebase okay so

10:00 - go to console
10:03 - also disclaimer guys if you are not able
10:06 - to for some reason
10:07 - of course if you're not able to for
10:08 - example keep up with me don't worry

13:28 - beautiful beautiful beautiful that is
13:31 - all good so now we've got that portion
13:33 - let's go to project settings all right
13:36 - and let's go to config you see there's a
13:38 - config right here
13:40 - click on the config portion right there
13:42 - and when you
13:43 - click the config portion you want to

13:47 - here's the config
13:48 - portion you're gonna copy it right there
13:51 - so command c copy the config no problem
13:54 - and then what i want you to do is let's
13:56 - go inside our project
13:58 - folder source right there click new file
14:01 - and let's create a firebase.js
14:06 - correct inside here i want you to paste
14:09 - in that that right there the firebase
14:12 - config
14:13 - now and what we're going to do now is
14:15 - now we're going to install firebase in
14:17 - our project very simple right
14:19 - so to do that let's open up our console
14:21 - if you do not have the console open
14:23 - just simply right click on it click open
14:24 - inside integrated terminal and it will
14:26 - open up the console for you
14:28 - i'm going to command kate to clear up my
14:30 - console beautiful

14:35 - davido you're going to type in
14:38 - npm install firebase dash tools good so
14:42 - we just
14:46 - we have all the firebase stuff for us so

15:12 - firebase tools that's amazing i
15:14 - like it i like it i like it all right so
15:16 - that's installed is there anything else
15:17 - i need to install besides that david
15:20 - uh not really as far as i know no i
15:23 - think we need to install a firebase as
15:24 - well but don't need to just install
15:26 - firebase but also firebase tools because
15:27 - if i so go to if i go to firebase
15:30 - firebase npm let me see so far
15:34 - npm right there let me see
15:37 - yes so we need to install firebase as
15:39 - well so not just tools but also firebase
15:41 - so do npm install
15:43 - i will do firebase so make sure you do
15:46 - that too okay
15:47 - there we go beautiful
15:51 - that's a good song guys so share this
15:53 - video with
15:54 - on facebook on youtube and everywhere
15:56 - that you guys can
15:58 - that'll be amazing all right let's go
16:00 - ahead and continue on so we got the
16:01 - firebase now
16:02 - what we need to do is very simple is we
16:04 - need to now use firebase now to do that
16:07 - all we got to do is you can see davis
16:08 - type is doing import firebase
16:10 - from from firebase
16:13 - right there that's pretty much it okay
16:15 - import firebase
16:16 - and now we're going to use it very
16:19 - simply to use it all we gotta do is do
16:21 - we're going to use the database portion
16:23 - of it so we'll say const db
16:25 - is equal to what david
16:28 - what is it wait wait wait wait we first
16:31 - we need to initialize the application
16:34 - well well technically correct yes so we
16:36 - have the firebase app so
16:38 - what he's doing is doing firebase app is
16:40 - equal to firebase.initialize apps you
16:43 - can see right there initialize
16:45 - app right there you see initialize app
16:48 - right there
16:48 - so firebase equals to initialize app and
16:50 - then we do const db
16:51 - right there let me go ahead and do that
16:53 - there is equal to what
16:55 - firebase dot firestore space.firestore
17:04 - all right that's going to be saved so
17:06 - again just so you guys know okay
17:08 - very very important right there this is
17:09 - the thing firebase initialize app so
17:11 - initialize that app very very important
17:13 - okay
17:13 - so then we're going to do is we will go
17:15 - ahead and export the db portion of
17:18 - you know firebase let's go and save this
17:20 - at this point so we've created firebase
17:22 - we've imported firebase from npm from no
17:25 - modules
17:26 - and just so you guys know a quick little
17:28 - nugget for you okay so
17:29 - make sure you guys remember this all
17:31 - right write this down
17:33 - for you when you do npm install where do
17:35 - you think it installs your packages
17:37 - well they get installed inside the null
17:39 - modules look at you see this all this
17:41 - stuff right here this is a non-modules
17:42 - folder
17:43 - that's where it gets installed if i go
17:45 - to null modules i can actually find

24:01 - guys
24:02 - we have product one and we have product
24:04 - two you see those are
24:06 - products okay and the question might be
24:09 - is
24:09 - well how do we get those products into
24:11 - our application
24:12 - well very simple what i want you to do
24:15 - i'm gonna make this a little bit less
24:17 - loud
24:18 - is let's go go ahead and go to home.js
24:21 - and this is where we will go ahead and
24:22 - actually import the products all right
24:25 - so inside home.gs right here what we
24:28 - will do is very simple
24:29 - we'll create a function okay first thing
24:32 - we need to do
24:32 - is we need to import db from firebase
24:34 - remember how we export db
24:36 - let's go into import import db
24:40 - db from what from what
24:43 - from firebase right there that's correct
24:47 - you want to make sure that you're
24:48 - importing it from the firebase.js file
24:51 - instead of the firebase module right
24:53 - exactly
25:01 - 200 plus likes let's go you guys
25:04 - are amazing thank you so much 200 more
25:07 - likes than viewers
25:09 - let's go that's crazy it's crazy crazy
25:11 - so crazy crazy
25:12 - so in the home.js what are we going to
25:14 - create let's go and create a function
25:16 - now
25:16 - now before we create a function to do
25:18 - anything right
25:20 - what i want you guys to do is actually
25:22 - to create a state
25:23 - so what dave is going to going to do is
25:25 - he is going to create
25:27 - product state now what does that mean
25:29 - okay i want you to pay attention here
25:30 - really quickly
25:32 - state in state in
25:35 - react gs is like a database react has
25:37 - its own kind of database it's kind of
25:39 - like
25:39 - it's a snapshot at a certain point in
25:41 - time right so
25:42 - what does that mean well this product is
25:45 - currently initialized to an array
25:47 - right so it's kind of like there this
25:50 - application
25:51 - will have products stored in that app
25:55 - right because we have a database because
25:57 - think about this here's let me let me
25:59 - show this to you okay
26:00 - here if you think about this i'm gonna
26:01 - show this to you yeah yeah good
26:03 - so we have this database right here no
26:05 - no let's go for this so this database
26:08 - okay and that database is gonna be
26:10 - firebase
26:11 - okay firebase and this has rows of data
26:15 - okay and it says rows of data so like
26:17 - one row
26:18 - you know that's these are documents
26:19 - they're called documents you guys know
26:20 - these are products okay
26:22 - so probably one so forth then what do we
26:24 - have is we have what well
26:26 - we have uh a our application correct
26:29 - there we go okay so this is going to be
26:31 - the app correct
26:33 - right there understood so make sure you
26:34 - guys understand this the app
26:36 - and the app of course has different
26:37 - things um let's say it has the header
26:40 - and so forth so let me go ahead and put
26:41 - this to rectangle
26:43 - so let's go ahead it has this right and
26:46 - it has different products one
26:48 - two and so forth right now right how is
26:51 - it supposed to
26:53 - save these products
26:57 - how's it supposed to do that how is
26:58 - supposed to know about these products
26:59 - all the time
27:00 - well what happens is that when we go
27:03 - ahead and pull
27:03 - data from firebase right from firebase
27:06 - what's going to happen is we're going to
27:08 - save that in a state and it's a snapshot
27:11 - and time of the actual application so
27:14 - let's go ahead and do this i will do
27:15 - rectangle and so what's going to happen
27:17 - is
27:18 - this app has a state of products
27:22 - okay so here let me go and say product
27:26 - okay right there oh sorry about the
27:29 - everything all the time
27:30 - and what's going to happen is these
27:32 - products are going to go
27:34 - into a database of the app itself
27:37 - right so let me go ahead and show it to
27:39 - you so it's kind of like this think
27:40 - about this it is a product it's going to
27:41 - go pretty much
27:42 - all the way here right it's going to
27:44 - travel through here
27:46 - and then we're going to save it into the
27:47 - state right there because
27:49 - why if we have it in the state what
27:52 - happens is that
27:53 - using that state we can actually go
27:55 - ahead and let remove me
27:56 - we can actually go ahead and show it on
27:59 - the
28:01 - actual web page right this is the flow
28:04 - get it from a database say it to the
28:06 - state
28:07 - from the state show it on the web page
28:10 - okay
28:10 - that's it and here's the thing every
28:12 - time for example let's say we add a new
28:14 - product
28:14 - okay every time you out to the state
28:17 - guess what
28:18 - react updates the product automatically
28:21 - right so it listens to the state so
28:23 - hopefully that kind of really was a good
28:25 - explanation for you to understand
28:26 - what is state it's a point in time and
28:30 - of course
28:30 - as we add more products right that
28:33 - picture that snapshot changes so we have
28:35 - new products and a product changes and
28:36 - so forth so that is what state is guys
28:39 - does that make sense hopefully all right
28:42 - beautiful
28:44 - whew that was a good explanation i
28:45 - actually enjoyed that
28:46 - [Laughter]
28:48 - i enjoy explaining that guys daniel says
28:53 - where is it daniel what is that daniel
28:55 - says you guys are
28:57 - better than 99 of the teachers from
28:58 - college thank you so much well that
29:00 - actually that that means a lot to us
29:01 - thank you that that's a lot
29:03 - it is is it populating product from the
29:05 - db yes we will do that that's correct
29:07 - it's going to populate the products from
29:08 - the db that is correct
29:11 - wow yes that cool yes that cool that is
29:14 - of course
29:15 - [Laughter]
29:18 - that is beautiful why are we using
29:20 - mongodb or five percent of manga because
29:22 - it's just easier for you guys to
29:23 - trust me okay so guys
29:27 - somebody said you guys make us
29:29 - understand this stuff so easily yeah i
29:30 - appreciate you that's that's always our
29:32 - goal okay
29:32 - so and if we make it a sense if we make
29:35 - it so easy if you understand so please
29:37 - share it guys okay this makes it
29:39 - so easy for us to get out there let's
29:40 - share this because again we're a
29:42 - community
29:42 - we're going to show what we know and how
29:45 - we teach all right so
29:46 - share this everybody i want to see at
29:48 - least one person if you can share it on
29:50 - facebook share this video on facebook if
29:52 - you can share it on facebook
29:53 - screenshot that share send it to me i'll
29:56 - give you some pointers
29:57 - [Laughter]
30:00 - beautiful all right all right so we've
30:02 - got that now how do we do that so we've
30:04 - created a state
30:05 - right here something called using use
30:06 - state that's how we create state
30:08 - and products that can be the process
30:10 - kind of database that i showed you
30:12 - and the set products is a function that
30:14 - we're going to use to change the state
30:16 - so let's say we want to update the state
30:18 - let's say we want to add a new product
30:19 - we're going to use set products
30:21 - beautiful now
30:23 - what's going to happen now this point is
30:25 - the following
30:26 - two two two boom boom boom right there
30:31 - now to do that to go ahead and get this
30:33 - let's go ahead actually before before
30:34 - using use effect let's not use this
30:36 - just yet david okay i don't want to uh
30:38 - get them too complicated
30:39 - i'm going to create a function called
30:41 - const get product
30:43 - okay is equal to we'll create a function
30:47 - right here
30:47 - okay equal to this right inside here
30:50 - we're going to
30:51 - we will use db to get the products right
30:54 - so let's do this
30:55 - we'll do a db ah okay fine david cohen
30:59 - you type
30:59 - so db.collection all right do the
31:02 - collection
31:03 - and we're going to grab the collection
31:04 - of products right
31:06 - so where is this coming from well guys
31:08 - remember right how do we get this well
31:10 - again
31:11 - product you see this collection name
31:12 - that's how we get this right here so to
31:14 - be the collection products okay
31:16 - and then now let's actually grab the
31:18 - documents
31:20 - we'll say on snapshot to grab that
31:23 - document it's saying basically it's very
31:25 - simple
31:27 - grab the documents grab the current
31:29 - snapshot
31:30 - of all the documents and show it to me
31:33 - right there
31:34 - so we'll do this on snapshot voila
31:37 - we'll grab the actual snapshot and then
31:40 - we will go ahead and do something with
31:42 - it now
31:43 - let's grab the actual data we'll do temp
31:45 - products is equal to nothing so
31:46 - initially right to kind of initialize
31:48 - the tempo has to be an empty array
31:50 - and then we'll do the following we'll do
31:53 - snapshot.map
31:56 - yes but before that before we do
31:58 - docs.met let me show this one second
31:59 - here before we do that david
32:00 - let's do console.log console.log
32:05 - console.log right there and we'll do
32:08 - what
32:08 - we'll do snapshot snap shot right there
32:11 - so the log snapshot okay beautiful
32:14 - so look snapshot and i want to show it
32:16 - to you so now of course
32:17 - if i go to my page now okay if i go to
32:20 - my page tab but by the way
32:21 - in order for you guys to start up your
32:22 - page make sure you do npm start like
32:24 - this
32:25 - make sure to make sure you have the page
32:26 - running so do npm start and enter
32:29 - i already done it so i do not need to do
32:30 - it again but
32:32 - look at this hold on david so if i
32:35 - refresh this page nothing's going to
32:36 - happen yet if i remove this get products
32:38 - here
32:39 - okay let's go ahead and inspect down
32:40 - between this one
32:43 - let me put it at the bottom here so we
32:45 - have it go to console here no problemo
32:48 - you see nothing's really happening okay
32:50 - i'm going to clear that this console
32:51 - nothing's really happening but if i do
32:53 - get products
32:55 - products i'm going to call this function
32:58 - right and boom we get something right
33:00 - away you see this right here
33:02 - boom right there we get something we
33:03 - have docs empty
33:05 - query and size i think i'm covering the
33:07 - data here but here we go
33:09 - docs empty data and size and docs is
33:12 - exactly
33:13 - look at this docs has two items
33:17 - remember we had two items two products
33:19 - you see
33:20 - so two items one and second
33:23 - now to get those two items here's what
33:25 - we do we'll do console.log we'll do
33:28 - and the way we get that is very simple
33:31 - we'll do temp
33:31 - products is equal to snapshot
33:35 - right there right there snapshot right
33:37 - dot docs
33:39 - dot what map so we're going to loop
33:42 - through every single dock
33:43 - that we have here you can see there's
33:45 - there's two docks right
33:47 - like i said here inside the docks
33:48 - there's a rate of two the map
33:50 - and for every single doc we'll do the
33:52 - following let me go ahead and do this
33:54 - we'll do doc
33:58 - doc and to get the actual data guys
34:01 - we'll do doc dot
34:04 - data dot dot data
34:09 - but the wait and look at this so dot
34:11 - data and let me go ahead and save this
34:12 - now
34:13 - and now i need to console the log you
34:15 - ready for this bro
34:17 - temp uh it's all ready let's go so i'm
34:20 - super ready i know i'm ready too
34:22 - so right there good so let me go ahead i

35:00 - that is awesome all right guys
35:03 - so what we have done so far it's crazy
35:06 - we create a database we save the
35:07 - database right
35:08 - it's somewhere in the cloud right it's a
35:10 - database right there
35:12 - we took the data and we showed it here
35:14 - on the front and look at this now we
35:15 - have this data
35:16 - how cool is that guys let me know down
35:18 - in the comments below if you are
35:19 - just as excited if this is like a new
35:21 - revolution for you that you just would
35:23 - in terms of what you just realized right
35:26 - that is amazing i mean that to me that's
35:29 - just crazy right
35:30 - so exactly and the speed that we we
35:33 - we had to just set it up like it was
35:35 - super fast yeah it took us literally
35:37 - literally took us like minutes to do
35:39 - this guys all right
35:40 - no yeah we got these products let's go
35:43 - ahead and change this up
35:44 - just a little bit what i want to do is i
35:46 - don't want to do doctor data i want to
35:48 - actually create a new structure for us
35:49 - i'm going to say
35:50 - i'm going to do like this let me see
35:51 - here so we'll do like the following
35:54 - so we'll do we'll create an object and
35:56 - this object will have an id
35:58 - and the actual data let me do this
36:00 - beautiful
36:01 - so object and the reason why i'm doing
36:03 - this is very simple
36:04 - because i want to be able to reference
36:07 - the id
36:07 - back okay so let you'll see why later on
36:11 - we'll do doc that id
36:14 - comma okay and then the product data
36:16 - will do product
36:18 - and that will be doc dot data data
36:21 - right there dot data
36:25 - beautiful data okay so let's go ahead
36:27 - and what did i do did i do something
36:28 - wrong
36:31 - um doc that id right
36:36 - no no you should be returning it you
36:38 - should be returning an object
36:41 - wait what oh i see why if you're doing
36:45 - that you should
36:45 - you should be going like this you need
36:47 - to put it into a parenthesis like that
36:48 - like the following oh yeah
36:51 - there we go that that's that but we'll
36:54 - return it back right there so
36:55 - okay so doctor id and product.data and
36:58 - that's gonna be 10 products now all i
37:00 - got to do is the following
37:02 - is look at this point is we have the 10
37:05 - products right here
37:06 - correct now i'm going to save this so we
37:09 - have this thing working
37:11 - beautiful now let's save this into the
37:14 - product
37:14 - state you see save it to the products
37:18 - state let's go ahead and do this so
37:21 - we'll do product state and we'll say the
37:22 - following we'll do
37:24 - set products products
37:27 - okay and we'll do what temp products
37:32 - beautiful 10 products okay save that
37:35 - voila cheeky picky all is
37:40 - picky i know so all right
37:43 - so sad products 10 products that's going
37:46 - to be good and so now look at this
37:48 - the product state has something let me
37:50 - go and do this now gotcha this out
37:52 - get products but now let's go to
37:54 - console.log
37:56 - console.log products you guys ready for
37:59 - this
38:00 - product okay let's see it boom
38:04 - because products all right let's see it
38:06 - let's see let's see let's see let's see
38:07 - it let's see it
38:09 - save it i'm gonna refresh this really
38:13 - quickly
38:14 - i need to refresh it one second here
38:17 - come on come on come on come on
38:18 - oh look at that
38:22 - i mean it's like it's like it's going
38:23 - nuts actually
38:25 - [Laughter]
38:26 - oh yeah because it keeps uh
38:30 - keeps refreshing the state yeah so
38:33 - this is where you have to be very very
38:35 - very careful okay it's now
38:36 - working the way it should for a few
38:38 - reasons oh look at that it's going
38:39 -  nuts
38:40 - so this is where oh look at this here's
38:42 - the data look at this guys
38:44 - boom id and the actual data is going to
38:47 - be there too
38:48 - but this is currently a little bit weird
38:50 - and odd for
38:51 - for one reason because the following
38:54 - look at this the issue is now becoming
38:57 - the fact that
38:58 - this right here is being ran too many
39:00 - times
39:02 - yeah it keeps you randomly way too many
39:05 - times all right
39:06 - all right and the reason why is because
39:08 - the this
39:10 - class this function is being re-rendered
39:12 - again again by
39:13 - react because of changes that are going
39:16 - on
39:16 - in the actual application to prevent
39:19 - that what we use is we use something
39:21 - called use effect
39:23 - this is called the react hook okay so
39:25 - keep in mind it's called the react
39:27 - hook okay use effect so we'll say this
39:30 - boom boom boom boom let me go ahead and
39:32 - close this up i don't need this
39:34 - use effect
39:37 - right and inside use effect
39:40 - the following will work pew pew pew pew
39:44 - okay good
39:47 - good product good so
39:50 - now to this out right all right what
39:52 - does this do
39:54 - okay before the get products b will be
39:57 - called too many times right because
40:00 - react re-renders kind of you know uh the
40:02 - application
40:03 - every single time there's something that
40:04 - happens on the front end right
40:06 - well here's the thing the problem now
40:08 - becomes is the following
40:10 - the products get called gets called too
40:12 - many times because there's a state that
40:13 - gets changed
40:14 - right and then that changes the state
40:16 - again and so forth and it's a little bit
40:17 - crazy
40:18 - so it's almost like a never-ending cycle
40:20 - because look at this
40:22 - we set products here that changes the
40:24 - state
40:25 - because changes state the step product
40:27 - gets called again and so it gets
40:28 - refreshed again
40:30 - now use effect on the other hand what it
40:34 - does
40:34 - is it only makes sure to call this
40:37 - function only
40:38 - once one time and you know when
40:41 - only when the home page is
40:45 - rendered the first time
40:48 - so when i refresh this page though for
40:49 - the first time
40:51 - that's when get product gets called and
40:53 - we can actually check that because i
40:54 - hear what i say
40:55 - check this out i can do console.log
41:00 - call product boom
41:03 - save that okay beautiful all right let
41:06 - me go and refresh this
41:07 - let me go ahead and spec down from this
41:09 - one amazing
41:12 - 268 likes let's go beautiful all right
41:16 - let's go to console log and i want to
41:18 - show you something here
41:20 - see boom right there look at this so
41:22 - look call products you see
41:24 - called product gets called only once
41:27 - after that we can solve log the product
41:30 - and what do we have guys well very
41:33 - simple got the id
41:34 - with the product data for one product
41:37 - and got the id if i put it
41:38 - in another product boom
41:42 - right there right cheeky pinky
41:46 - guys how cool is this
41:49 - right we went from literally we not
41:52 - being able to see products to actually
41:53 - have products from the database which is
41:55 - so so so awesome
41:58 - let me see let me see what do we have
41:59 - here we have some great got some quick
42:01 - comments boom
42:02 - says natalia that's beautiful let me see
42:04 - i remember for the first project i've
42:06 - ever used reg hooks with my team and we
42:07 - couldn't figure out
42:09 - oh let's see so remember the first time
42:11 - uh quick figure
42:12 - use effect to save our lives low we got
42:14 - it by a third project nice well
42:16 - hopefully now you guys understand it
42:20 - okay exactly i think so too when you
42:23 - mount it yes
42:24 - beautiful exactly when the page mounts
42:27 - yes that is correct natalia when the
42:29 - page mounts first
42:31 - you guys are amazing and we're funny i
42:33 - mean you know hopefully you know
42:34 - i'm pretty funny i try to be funny and
42:36 - then you know uh david he's trying to be
42:38 - funny sometimes he's funny suddenly he's
42:40 - not funny so it depends
42:42 - come on someone's like yes
42:46 - nice beautiful so
42:49 - on update what will happen we'll we'll
42:50 - talk about that in a little bit on the
42:52 - update of the products we'll talk about
42:53 - what happens to then
42:54 - okay learning the good the
42:57 - this life cycle hooks helped me
42:59 - understand use effect beautiful
43:01 - david smiles that's all david does he
43:03 - just smiles
43:09 - all right beautiful nice job nice that's
43:11 - what i'm talking about all right so
43:13 - we got that portion here's what i want
43:14 - you to do now guys so we got the
43:16 - products okay
43:17 - that is all great somebody says thanks
43:19 - bro keep it up
43:20 - thank you so much now we got the
43:23 - products in the state the question of
43:25 - becomes is
43:26 - how do we connect this the products
43:29 - to the actual products inside here well
43:32 - that is to be is going to be pretty
43:35 - pretty cool because check this out
43:37 - look at this in the product right here's
43:40 - the product right here
43:41 - and of course product has its own little
43:43 - thing right has its own little thing
43:44 - right there well look at this currently
43:47 - this ipad pro
43:48 - is static that's what we call a static
43:50 - data correct that's called static data
43:52 - guys
43:53 - now to go ahead and actually
43:56 - maybe i can move myself a little bit
43:58 - more here what do you think maybe
43:59 - somewhere in the middle no i'll move it
44:00 - no i'll put it in this in the corner
44:02 - it's fine now to go ahead
44:05 - and you know actually do something about
44:07 - this
44:08 - okay we want the deal to come direct
44:11 - directly from where
44:12 - did david from where we
44:15 - direct we want to commit from the from
44:17 - the state that we just downloaded from
44:20 - right exactly right so this is where
44:22 - johann is saying
44:24 - props for the win so look at this in
44:27 - react.js here's a cool thing you can do
44:28 - you know how we can pass
44:29 - in you know properties or parameters
44:31 - into functions you can pass in
44:33 - parameters
44:34 - into components or it's called props
44:38 - right so here's what we'll do for
44:41 - example let's do product here
44:43 - okay and what's going to happen is
44:46 - here's what we'll do
44:47 - we'll go ahead and do the following i'll
44:48 - do uh well let's go and loop through the
44:50 - products
44:51 - look at this we'll go do like this we'll
44:53 - do products
44:55 - dub map dot map and for every single
44:59 - product
45:01 - boom right there cheeky picky all right
45:03 - product
45:04 - here's what we'll do we're going to get
45:07 - well uh there's gonna be product i'm
45:10 - gonna say
45:11 - i'm gonna say data here data okay
45:14 - okay and the following is going to
45:17 - happen
45:17 - let's go ahead and put this into
45:18 - parentheses like this no that's not what
45:21 - i want
45:22 - good we'll turn this into a product
45:26 - what into a product component
45:30 - but not just a product component right
45:32 - because think about it let me go and
45:33 - remove these products because we don't
45:34 - need these anymore
45:36 - okay think about this you see this still
45:40 - shows up oh
45:41 - you're right there this still shows up
45:43 - butcher this out
45:44 - what i'm going to do now at this point
45:45 - is i will pass in the data
45:47 - of the actual product here's what we'll
45:49 - say i will say title
45:52 - correct david is equal to one david
45:55 - it's going to be equal to data
45:59 - dot uh name but i don't think you need
46:01 - these squiggly braces no it's
46:05 - data.product.name
46:06 - because remember our data has the id and
46:08 - it has a product which has the data
46:10 - about the product
46:11 - okay that's correct yes then we'll do
46:13 - what
46:14 - price is equal to what
46:17 - data the product correct
46:20 - price the price okay next up is going to
46:23 - be what
46:24 - rating is equal to what data
46:29 - the product dot what
46:33 - rating beautiful and finally the last
46:37 - one is going to be which one
46:39 - image and that's going to equal to what
46:42 - product no data.product the product
46:46 - that image product yeah
46:49 - product that image right there beautiful
46:51 - okay
46:52 - and look at this now
46:55 - where is this all going to go because if
46:57 - i pass i say nothing's going to happen
46:58 - just yet if i refresh this again
47:00 - see it's the same thing no problem
47:02 - whatsoever correct
47:03 - but listen up very very closely okay
47:07 - very important
47:11 - okay so look props
47:15 - right what we're going to do is we're
47:17 - actually going to pass in the data
47:19 - as a parameter in something called props
47:23 - and what really props is is it just an
47:25 - object look at this if i do console the
47:27 - log
47:29 - there's nothing fancy about this one
47:30 - here at all
47:33 - look props okay there's nothing fancy at
47:35 - all
47:36 - i do inspect element on this one let me
47:38 - remove my little screen here
47:40 - okay i do consult a log console
47:44 - okay product boom look at this this is
47:46 - props right here right
47:48 - props one props two and look at this all
47:51 - we're passing in
47:52 - is the actual data image price rating
47:56 - and title same thing for the next one
47:58 - image price
47:59 - rating and title see apple mapper pro
48:03 - apple ipad pro that is it guys
48:06 - and this is what props is because we
48:08 - pass it in from where
48:10 - from the product that goes from there
48:13 - that goes to the product
48:14 - correct and the product we get it inside
48:17 - the props which is all it is just a
48:18 - parameter of the function
48:20 - that's pretty much it does that make
48:21 - sense yes or no let me know in the
48:22 - comments below i'm very curious what you
48:24 - guys think about that
48:26 - 291 likes can we get to 300 i would love
48:29 - you guys so much
48:32 - all right let's go beautiful now at this
48:35 - point the few things is going to happen
48:38 - now to get the data you see how he props
48:40 - the image props are title
48:41 - look at this all i gotta do now is
48:43 - change the title instead of doing this
48:45 - guys this is magic this is literally
48:47 - magic all i gotta do is i do props
48:50 - dot what title title
48:53 - title are you ready for this save boom
48:56 - right there cheeky peaky
49:00 - lemon squeezy all right so perhaps the
49:02 - title
49:03 - is right there right away right because
49:06 - where
49:07 - this is what we got perhaps the title
49:09 - again comes from here will be passed
49:11 - into the props
49:12 - this shown here that's literally it guys
49:16 - that's
49:16 - literally it okay then next day is props
49:19 - up price
49:20 - for the rating we will go ahead and take
49:22 - a look at how to do that in a little bit
49:23 - so don't worry about that let's not
49:24 - worry about that just yet
49:25 - but let's do the image now let's do the
49:27 - image now it's going to remove this
49:29 - string
49:29 - image we'll remove that portion right
49:32 - and to map this image what are we going
49:34 - to do we'll do props dot
49:36 - image because it comes from where from
49:39 - directly from here
49:40 - beautiful and then guys that
49:43 - is pretty much boom voila
49:47 - that is it look at this guys
49:50 - this is where it's coming from now we
49:52 - have two products
49:54 - that come directly from a database and
49:56 - this is amazing
49:58 - so what we can now do at this point is
50:00 - very simple if we go to the products
50:02 - section let me go the product here
50:10 - yeah so for the product section all we
50:12 - gotta do now at this point is for the
50:13 - price we could just pass in
50:15 - dollar sign here so we have a dollar
50:17 - here look at that so now we have 1279
50:21 - 1449 that is pretty much
50:23 - it guys who was excited for we just did
50:25 - this is pretty amazing guys let me see
50:27 - amazing teaching thank you guys
50:29 - appreciate you appreciate you boom boom
50:31 - boom i like bro they're catching on onto
50:35 - our little phrases you know
50:39 - thanks david says right holy moly
50:42 - this is awesome that is awesome i'm
50:44 - happy to hear that
50:45 - this was amazing superb natalie says
50:50 - [Laughter]
50:52 - see that's what you did oh my god now
50:55 - everybody over there is going to do it
50:58 - brendan says did not know you can pass
50:59 - props just like that well no
51:01 - yes you can love from pakistan amazing
51:04 - beautiful
51:05 - it was amazing you guys are amazing says
51:07 - let's dance
51:08 - it's okay we'll dance a little bit let's
51:09 - let's go ahead and finish up our product
51:11 - page and maybe we can dance in a little
51:12 - bit okay
51:13 - so don't worry about this
51:17 - wow all right awesome so now the
51:19 - question that becomes is how do we go
51:21 - ahead and create these stars
51:22 - what do we do with this section huh how
51:24 - do we do the stars guys
51:26 - well to do the stars is
51:29 - it's pretty pretty simple i mean yes and
51:32 - no
51:32 - it depends on how how you think about
51:34 - this so
51:36 - to create this how would you how would i
51:39 - do it
51:40 - um we can use something called the array
51:44 - right and when array is the following
51:46 - here's what can do i can initialize an
51:48 - empty array because the star is just
51:50 - number four one or two
51:51 - here i can initialize an array and i can
51:53 - give it a rating so look at this
51:55 - right because look at this if i go take
51:58 - a look at this
51:59 - look at this take a look at this god and
52:00 - just type your penis kind of stuff but
52:02 - it still don't matter
52:03 - look all right if i go to console
52:05 - underneath here
52:06 - beautiful i will say array and let's say
52:08 - i push pass in four
52:10 - see it's an empty array right there it's
52:14 - an empty array of
52:15 - four four it's an empty array basically
52:17 - right there or fourth something
52:18 - now what i'll do is i'll do that fill so
52:20 - i'll do for example array.fail
52:23 - i just wanna should you guys to see this
52:24 - right i'll do array.fail
52:28 - array4 and also that fill but of nothing
52:34 - book so we have four items now there's
52:37 - nothing inside here
52:39 - that's it it's undefined but the cool
52:41 - thing about this is that we can now
52:42 - loop through them four times so if the
52:44 - reading is four we can
52:46 - do four stars here's how we can do that
52:48 - check this out
52:49 - i can do a radar reading four and all i
52:52 - do at this point is well it's
52:54 - it's uh pretty simple i will do the
52:56 - following do
52:57 - that fail dot fill that nothing
53:01 - dot map correct
53:04 - all right let's say it's a rating i just
53:07 - whatever it might be let's just say it's
53:08 - it literally can be nothing i will say
53:10 - you're reading the map
53:12 - but for that what i can do
53:15 - boom and i can put a star
53:20 - well uh to put the star i actually have
53:21 - to put into the p-tech so let's do it
53:23 - like this
53:24 - we'll do p and i'll put the star inside
53:27 - here so put the star in here
53:29 - put the start in here put it david good
53:32 - nice job
53:33 - right there nice right there you know oh

56:47 - now one cool trick i want to show you on
56:49 - here is very simple let me go ahead and
56:51 - save this all right
56:52 - and here's one cool trick you see how we
56:55 - have props
56:56 - and we get the title we get the price
56:58 - and the rating and stuff like this
57:00 - okay in the image well what if i don't
57:03 - want to
57:04 - guys everybody's saying
57:05 - [Music]
57:08 - what did we start david so look
57:11 - props is great great great it's great
57:14 - but what i want to do is i want to do
57:16 - something called unpack it
57:18 - right i don't want to use the props
57:20 - variable all the time
57:22 - i can unpack it by use doing something
57:24 - like this look at this pay attention
57:25 - here really quickly here
57:27 - object and now we do title
57:31 - comma price
57:35 - comma rating
57:38 - comma what image
57:45 - actually comma id because we have that
57:47 - too
57:48 - now now of course this breaks yes but
57:51 - what we have done right now is that the
57:54 - title the price
57:55 - what you have done the look at this the
57:57 - props
57:58 - just to give you perspective props was
58:02 - is equal to right is equal to this
58:03 - object that has like the
58:05 - the title and you know and you know the
58:07 - price and so forth right
58:09 - right well what we have done is we
58:12 - unpacked it it's like think of it as
58:13 - like
58:14 - you're going to you know imagine you're
58:16 - like you have a gift
58:17 - right let me imagine there's water right
58:20 - all you want ahead is you
58:21 - you literally uncap the water and you
58:24 - poured out the water and you only you
58:26 - the only thing you're using now is just
58:27 - the water okay or like for example
58:29 - you're all
58:30 - unwrapping a gift right there's the box
58:32 - which is the props
58:34 - the content inside of it that's your
58:36 - gift correct
58:37 - what we're doing is we're unwrapping it
58:39 - that's called unwrapping
58:41 - and so we're simply just getting the
58:42 - title the pripes
58:44 - the writing their image in the id out of
58:47 - it
58:48 - how cool is that understanding i think
58:50 - that's pretty cool
58:51 - honestly so let me go ahead and save
58:53 - this
58:55 - beautiful i'm going to save that portion
58:58 - and look at that
58:59 - it still works no problem all we've done
59:01 - is we unpacked it
59:03 - unpack the thing here and we did not
59:05 - need to use
59:06 - props dot something here at all all we
59:09 - did is we simply just took the data
59:11 - out of props we got it okay

62:18 - and
62:18 - put this on here cart items
62:22 - cart items and then cart total
62:27 - beautiful right there so two components
62:29 - okay what i've just done for you is i've
62:31 - divided this into two components
62:32 - so you can see it fully understood
62:34 - comprending
62:35 - peaky i gotta stop saying that
62:38 - [Laughter]
62:40 - no it's okay it's all good i know i know
62:43 - but
62:43 - awesome so that's all good so it's two
62:45 - items now in the car that's exactly what
62:47 - we will do
62:48 - so let's go ahead and click create the
62:49 - container first so go ahead
62:51 - and do that uh for us beautiful
62:55 - container so what david is now doing is
62:57 - creating a styled that day of
62:58 - container right there okay just how we
63:01 - always do it
63:02 - so you guys know exactly right there
63:04 - beautiful and
63:06 - he's done it inside here as well
63:08 - understood
63:10 - of course understood all right all right
63:12 - next up is going to be the card item
63:14 - section so we'll create a component
63:16 - called card items and a
63:18 - second component called create card
63:20 - total
63:21 - all right so now beautiful beautiful
63:25 - beautiful
63:25 - let's go ahead and create those specific
63:27 - components inside here
63:29 - let's go to source and we'll do new file
63:32 - we'll do
63:33 - cart items.js voila
63:37 - good and got it what's up i already got
63:41 - it oh

64:35 - okay that's amazing and that's gonna be
64:37 - the cart
64:39 - total total section all right
64:43 - understood everybody understands
64:46 - of course comprende comprendes so card
64:48 - total and
64:50 - so these are the two components that
64:51 - we'll use basically now the question
64:53 - that becomes
64:54 - how do we go ahead and actually you know
64:56 - change up these components what do we do
64:57 - with them in terms of
64:58 - you know actual width and height and so
65:00 - forth well a few simple things
65:02 - for the card items let's go ahead and do
65:03 - this let's create a container so maybe
65:05 - can you add style components to this one
65:07 - so container
65:08 - of course
65:12 - good so what david is doing now is he's
65:14 - adding style components
65:15 - right there beautiful
65:20 - yes
65:23 - oh my god what's up
65:26 - everybody's saying holy moly
65:30 - what did you do now i don't know what i
65:33 - do
65:35 - everything is happening so that's gonna
65:37 - be the container for the card items
65:39 - and let's go and go to cart total and do
65:41 - the same thing here so let's do cart
65:43 - container container right there
65:47 - oh boom same thing here
65:51 - container right there beautiful and
65:53 - we'll do
65:54 - cons container equal styled
65:58 - i got it david okay okay okay sorry
66:02 - about that
66:06 - style that div okay awesome so container
66:08 - no
66:09 - i spelled that wrong
66:12 - don't judge me guys it's all good
66:15 - if you judge me if you judge me i'm okay
66:17 - with that
66:19 - i don't care wait too much all right

66:23 - however it's like comprende yes
66:26 - [Laughter]
66:27 - somebody said you guys somebody said you
66:29 - guys get everything
66:30 - boom
66:36 - all right so that's two items so we have
66:38 - card items and card total right so those
66:40 - are the ones we've created
66:41 - and if we go to our actual application
66:44 - which is this one right here
66:45 - right let's couldn't actually import
66:47 - them now so we'll go to the uh
66:48 - card section let's import them right so
66:52 - go ahead david and report those card
66:53 - items card total go ahead david
66:56 - i'm just wait wait wait wait so what do
66:58 - we what do we do
66:59 - i'm going to import import
67:04 - card items oh
67:07 - hold on items from
67:10 - what cart
67:14 - oh so funny you guys decide we're typing
67:15 - at the same time guys how cool is this
67:17 - how cute and i'm faster that's fine
67:22 - all right so look at this card items and
67:24 - card
67:25 - total right so beautiful all right now
67:28 - now let's think about this so so now we
67:31 - have those two components
67:32 - one and two all right now
67:35 - somebody said it's right somebody's
67:37 - already saying the answer to what we're
67:38 - going to do now next
67:40 - is because you know now we want to make
67:42 - them side by side
67:44 - to make them side by side what do we do
67:46 - guys well pretty simple
67:47 - it's display flex
67:50 - flex now before i do that
67:54 - let's do this what are we going to do
67:56 - display
67:57 - display flex well
68:01 - a car items and car total are pretty
68:03 - much
68:04 - there but we're not done either yet
68:08 - because why tell me why i mean we need
68:11 - to
68:12 - drop in the items that we are actually
68:14 - purchasing
68:15 - good good and then what
68:19 - and we will need to pass them into card
68:21 - items
68:22 - and card total good yes but that's not
68:25 - it guys
68:25 - this is not it what i want us to do is
68:27 - very simple i want to
68:29 - define what it means for our card items
68:32 - the card total so look at this
68:34 - display flags is all good but i will go
68:36 - to cart items
68:37 - let me go ahead and save this card items
68:39 - i would say this
68:40 - container i'm going to give it a height
68:42 - for now just temporarily okay i'll say
68:43 - height
68:44 - of let's say 300 pixels okay and what
68:48 - i'll do is i'll do background color
68:52 - color let's say white right now good
68:55 - background color white okay so you can
68:57 - see right there boom white is the color
68:59 - that we just got
69:00 - right there awesome that's car items
69:01 - okay all right the card total
69:06 - same thing here card total where's the
69:08 - card total right there
69:09 - card total same thing here right i'll
69:12 - give it a height of now 200 pixels
69:16 - right but the background color is also
69:19 - white
69:20 - correct
69:27 - white amazing beauty white did i say
69:29 - that right
69:31 - i think so yeah background color white
69:34 - awesome so look at this now we have
69:35 - those two items guys all right
69:37 - this one and this one now
69:40 - here's what we do at this point okay
69:42 - very very simple
69:43 - all right let's go to uh card.js
69:48 - gs and i want to find
69:51 - the card items to be to take up 80
69:55 - of everything so what i will do is very
69:57 - simple i will go to card audience
69:59 - gs and i will say flex 0.8
70:04 - boom so what this is going to do is hey
70:07 - the importance of the cart item section
70:10 - is actually how much david
70:13 - so the card items is now going to take
70:16 - up
70:16 - uh 80 of the space that both of the two
70:20 - both the card items and the card total
70:23 - had exactly
70:24 - exactly and then what do we have at this
70:26 - point is
70:27 - the card items takes up 80 and how much
70:30 - do you think the cartridge will take up
70:32 - i mean the car total is only taking up
70:34 - as much as it needs so it
70:36 - is just the minimum require man but it
70:39 - has
70:40 - 20 percent the room yes so what i will
70:42 - do is i'll go now to cart
70:44 - total and i will give this one a flex of
70:47 - what
70:47 - 0.2 0.2 done
70:51 - now again we're not done yet because now
70:53 - let's go ahead and add some penny
70:54 - because i want us to have the
70:56 - to have padding and i want this to look
70:58 - nice all right
70:59 - so what i'm going to do is i will add
71:02 - well i will add margin right of 18
71:03 - pixels to everything to the card item
71:05 - section so margin
71:07 - margin right
71:10 - right of 18 pixels all right good
71:15 - nice you see they added some padding
71:16 - margin to it good
71:18 - and i want us to to have now as well is
71:21 - well
71:21 - let's go ahead and go to the cart inside
71:23 - here and i'm going to give the card
71:26 - also some padding so cards because the
71:28 - card is which one the card is
71:31 - this part is the right that's the whole
71:32 - thing that's the card right so i'm going
71:34 - to give the padding
71:35 - we'll say padding let's do the whole
71:37 - trouble thing remember this one
71:38 - so oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
71:40 - so we'll do what
71:41 - we'll do top is 14 pixels
71:45 - yeah good good so we'll do top is 14
71:48 - pixels
71:50 - okay right is going to be 18 pixels
71:55 - okay 18 pixels okay
71:59 - bottom is going to be zero and then left
72:01 - is going to be what
72:04 - i'm not sure 80. okay that looks good
72:06 - boom voila
72:08 - look at that guys now we have ourselves
72:10 - a beautiful much
72:11 - better carter correct right correct of
72:14 - course correct
72:16 - beautiful awesome so that is good now
72:19 - let's go ahead and add some padding on
72:20 - the inside of it as well because you see
72:21 - how it's just kind of like it's wonky
72:23 - you see it's i wanted to be to create
72:25 - some padding in there as well
72:27 - so what i will do is i will do card
72:28 - items let me go ahead and do this and
72:34 - save that go to cart items and we'll do
72:37 - padding
72:39 - of 20 pixels correct okay
72:42 - save that hey there we go for the card
72:45 - total
72:46 - shall we do the same yeah for starters

73:49 - nice job guys good amazing job cool so
73:52 - okay we've got the card total we've got
73:54 - this
73:54 - now what are we going to do is let's
73:56 - focus just on the card item section okay
73:58 - should we do that bro okay we should do
74:01 - that all right
74:02 - the card items are going to have a few
74:04 - things number one
74:05 - is what does it have well if you look at
74:06 - it we have what the shopping cart
74:09 - and then we have a line and then we have
74:11 - the actual product of the card item
74:13 - itself all right
74:14 - so now let's do that okay let's do
74:18 - the title good let's go to the shopping
74:20 - cart all right so typing shopping cart
74:22 - in there
74:22 - that's gonna be what we're going to
74:24 - paste and that's this one correct
74:26 - and then we'll do the hr so hr just
74:28 - simply stands for the line so horizontal
74:30 - line
74:31 - or it's called horizontal ruler i think
74:33 - it's what it's called beautiful
74:35 - i thought it was horizontal that's why
74:38 - it's hr
74:39 - okay no no no i think it's a horizontal
74:42 - ruler okay and then finally the last one
74:44 - is going to be which ones
74:46 - the actual items div that's going to
74:49 - create
74:49 - have the actual components all right so
74:51 - let's do items items
74:53 - got items container right the condensed
74:56 - container is going to be what guys so
74:57 - let's think about this just so we have
74:58 - here for a second all right
75:00 - if you think about this this right here
75:02 - is what
75:03 - this is the items container you see
75:06 - then what we have then we have the
75:08 - shopping cart
75:09 - oh the shopping cart is this one
75:13 - of course the line is that
75:16 - that's pretty much it understood
75:18 - comprende
75:20 - one day good all right
75:23 - now the question that becomes is what
75:25 - how do we know what do we do with this
75:26 - now like how do we
75:27 - supposed to do all this stuff right here
75:29 - i really don't know
75:30 - right again very very very simple let's
75:33 - do this guys
75:35 - let's do this right
75:38 - so what i want to do now with you guys
75:40 - is what's going to happen is
75:42 - this is going to be called what should
75:43 - we call this now right this should be a
75:46 - component correct yes or no what do you
75:48 - guys think tell me
75:49 - that big component i think so
75:53 - right well let's actually make into a
75:55 - component
75:56 - and the component is going to be called
75:58 - what
76:00 - it's going to be called card item
76:04 - voila cool so cart item all right
76:07 - so you can see what i'm doing is i'm
76:08 - creating these components i'm not
76:09 - worrying so much about passing the data
76:12 - and nothing so much at all i'm just
76:14 - creating the components that's pretty
76:15 - much it okay
76:17 - so card item let's not create that so
76:19 - let's go ahead and create the card item
76:20 - component
76:21 - uh david i'll let you do the do this one
76:23 - as well do this one
76:24 - by yourself create the item component
76:28 - so do that create the card item
76:30 - component you do it doing it
76:33 - oh yeah it says running file create
76:35 - participant so
76:36 - it should be doing it let me see item
76:38 - component
76:39 - refresh my page i don't see your card
76:43 - component bro nah it's something
76:45 - something with uh
76:46 - with vs code that's fine all right
76:49 - that's fine so i'm going to do a new
76:50 - file here
76:51 - yeah yeah i get to use it now you look i
76:53 - get the control so
76:54 - wait wait wait there it is there it is
76:56 - you have it now oh
76:57 - let's go beautiful so card on the gs
77:01 - they will type in rfce nice we gotta
77:04 - sell the component beautiful
77:06 - nice job good and so what's going to
77:08 - happen is he's going to import
77:09 - style from style components nice job and
77:12 - then i'm going to convert these divs to
77:14 - containers
77:18 - there contain this boom right there so
77:20 - do container
77:21 - container
77:25 - container amazing amazing amazing
77:27 - amazing awesome work
77:29 - huh teamwork team working dude
77:32 - powerful teamwork let's go
77:36 - good so we got the container now this is
77:38 - going to be a individual card item so
77:40 - i'm gonna just say card item in here so
77:41 - you guys can see exactly what we are
77:43 - using card item
77:45 - okay so we've created the card item make
77:47 - sure you do the inside the source folder
77:48 - okay very important
77:50 - and let's go back to card.js now let's
77:52 - go back to cart items
77:54 - that's what i want to go back to come on
77:57 - items right there all right so let's go
78:00 - ahead and do command b
78:01 - to remove this that the thing let's go
78:03 - to our application and car item is not
78:05 - defined and because we need to import it
78:07 - so we'll do import
78:09 - cart item from
78:12 - what is a cart i've got this dave if i'm
78:15 - typing i'm typing
78:17 - [Laughter]
78:20 - this guy this guy just wants to just
78:23 - type
78:23 - every single time
78:27 - i don't understand it all right so card
78:30 - item is there awesome sweet
78:32 - now the question that becomes is let's
78:34 - go ahead and now
78:36 - change this card item to have the exact
78:38 - things that we need to have it well
78:40 - a few things are going to be so if you
78:42 - think about it
78:43 - let's go to cart item so what do we have
78:46 - in this car item how are we going to
78:47 - divide this up into
78:49 - rows and columns right you tell me david
78:53 - all right
78:54 - so we will have two divs at the top
78:58 - level
78:58 - one of them is going to contain the
79:00 - image which is going to be one div
79:02 - that's our item so we're going to have
79:04 - what
79:05 - image yeah yeah we are going to have an
79:07 - image
79:09 - and then on the right hand side we are
79:10 - going to have the rest of the stuff
79:12 - so well actually a few things we're
79:14 - going to have what not just that but
79:16 - we're going to
79:16 - split this up into the info right here
79:19 - info yeah
79:20 - exactly that's good the price so oh
79:23 - so you want to go that way yeah so three
79:25 - components three components
79:26 - why here's why because i see things in
79:29 - rows and columns okay so i want you to
79:31 - pay attention to this really quickly
79:32 - guys you can see
79:33 - right you can see here that right this
79:35 - is one component good
79:37 - this is another component good and this
79:39 - however because
79:40 - it has this and this inside of it right
79:43 - it has two horizontal components
79:45 - along with one a vertical component the
79:48 - way i see right away i need to combine
79:49 - that into
79:50 - one container right because if i do that
79:53 - what's going to happen what's going to
79:56 - happen then if i do that
79:57 - what's going to happen and i can i'm
79:59 - going to put a rectangle here
80:01 - i can split this up into a component
80:03 - here and
80:04 - put this opposite component here right
80:07 - and then what's going to happen is
80:08 - because of that i can make these
80:10 - horizontal
80:12 - and this can still be component than
80:14 - another component
80:15 - understood so hopefully you guys get
80:17 - that portion because that's a really
80:18 - interesting portion that's how you
80:20 - you want to think about every time that
80:22 - you go ahead and you
80:23 - think about how to build things with
80:25 - components or just in general in
80:27 - the in you know any web application rows
80:30 - and columns
80:31 - rows columns rows columns
80:34 - keep that in your mind okay rows columns
80:37 - rows
80:38 - columns and rows and columns and rows
80:40 - and columns and rows
80:42 - and columns and rows in case
80:48 - you see people dropping rows and columns
80:50 - in the chat i know right but that's good
80:52 - i want them to think about that
80:53 - so let's go to cart item all right the
80:56 - first thing that we said is going to be
80:57 - what
80:58 - is going to be the image right so it's
81:00 - going to create the image container
81:01 - right so we'll do image container here
81:03 - it's going to create the image container
81:05 - and again here i'm going to map
81:06 - exactly what you're doing to an actual
81:08 - so let's do image container
81:13 - everybody's saying that's so interesting
81:14 - that's so cool awesome guys that makes
81:16 - me happy you guys are
81:17 - getting this okay so again this image
81:19 - container that's going to be
81:20 - there right there good good good good
81:23 - good
81:24 - then the next one is going to be
81:25 - something called the the info right so
81:27 - that's going to be the info
81:30 - shortcut for that works as well good
81:33 - that's going to be this portion right
81:34 - here the whole this uh
81:36 - this whole thing that's the card item
81:38 - info right
81:39 - oh sure what just happened right that's
81:42 - gonna be
81:43 - where that's gonna go into the car item
81:45 - info
81:47 - good good then there's car item what in
81:50 - for what
81:51 - top and bottom because again that's the
81:54 - top
81:55 - this is the bottom section
81:59 - good card item let's make it what
82:02 - the quantity good so then the quantity
82:05 - right here that's going to be this
82:06 - section right here
82:09 - what
82:12 - item delete
82:15 - boom right there good so then we have
82:18 - what the quantity contained because you
82:19 - think about the bottom right is its own
82:21 - little dip correct
82:22 - if you think about this and the bottom
82:24 - has quantity and then delete good
82:26 - and then finally let's go ahead and make
82:27 - the third one let's go ahead and make
82:28 - the third component that's gonna be the
82:29 - price one so that's gonna be the
82:31 - uh price all right so we'll do card item
82:33 - price
82:34 - good that's going to be this div right
82:36 - here
82:38 - whoop boom right there awesome i
82:41 - actually would have included carter
82:43 - and price in the info whatever no i
82:46 - don't
82:46 - know that wouldn't work actually you'll
82:48 - you'll see why later that would not work
82:50 - because because now that wouldn't work
82:51 - actually you know that would be bad okay
82:53 - no matter don't worry
82:56 - all right time for
83:00 - this right good so look at this guys do
83:03 - you understand this yes or no like the
83:04 - way we just style these components when
83:06 - we put this component
83:07 - it's for for a reason correct it's
83:09 - always for a reason so let's now think
83:10 - about this all right
83:11 - let me go ahead and remove these now
83:13 - good now let's actually put the data in
83:15 - so the image container that's going to
83:17 - contain what
83:18 - well let's go ahead and actually create
83:19 - image so we'll do image
83:21 - source is equal to something let's go
83:24 - ahead and make that image source right
83:26 - now
83:26 - again we'll make it static so i'll do
83:28 - copy image address and i'll put this in
83:29 - here
83:32 - and then we'll close out this image okay
83:35 - no need for that image right now okay
83:37 - beautiful that's the image container
83:39 - next up we have what
83:41 - uh the car item info that can be the top
83:44 - so we'll put this in here i see each
83:46 - side here and this will be an h2 so
83:48 - let's put it inside the h2
83:50 - so we'll do h2 that's a
83:53 - heading two so we'll copy that portion
83:57 - good go ahead so that's in h2 and then
84:02 - finally
84:03 - then the quantity let's not focus on
84:05 - that so much there let's do like five or
84:07 - something like that let's not focus
84:08 - much on that right now but the delete
84:11 - container let's just say delete on here
84:13 - okay delete and finally the price is
84:15 - going to be 14.49
84:19 - good
84:25 - good so we'll save that we'll save the
84:26 - card items
84:28 - good good good good good
84:31 - it's good you got that portion bro
84:33 - awesome
84:34 - beautiful so now guys all right
84:37 - car items now individual card item
84:41 - is going to have some really really
84:43 - really really really really really
84:44 - interesting stuff all right
84:46 - first things first let's go and take a
84:47 - look at it oh style undefined
84:50 - okay where is it style oh look at
84:53 - that he create all the style stuff nice
84:56 - job go and refresh this
84:58 - no problem oh let's go that's so
85:01 - beautiful look at this
85:03 - it's completely havoc okay don't worry
85:06 - about this
85:07 - gotcha gotcha okay let's i think it
85:10 - looks good
85:11 - i mean it's okay so it's okay it's all
85:14 - good so here's what i want to do
85:15 - here's what i want to do for because the
85:17 - reason why it's so big
85:19 - is because again this image is trying to
85:20 - take as much space as it possibly can so
85:22 - what do you guys think we need to do
85:23 - right now to fix that well we need to go
85:26 - the card item
85:27 - image container or is the image
85:28 - container right there okay
85:31 - let's create this container let's give
85:32 - this container an actual like
85:34 - width right let's say let's give it a
85:35 - width i'm going to say width
85:37 - of 180 pixels
85:40 - and 80 pixels okay and then
85:44 - height
85:48 - of 180 pixels
85:51 - right there beautiful right so that's
85:53 - all good i like that portion let me go
85:55 - ahead and oh look at that you see
85:56 - now some things have shifted but again
85:58 - that's completely okay right
86:00 - now for the actual image now what we
86:02 - need to do is we do
86:03 - object fit contain let's do that right
86:05 - now
86:07 - good height we can do an object just do
86:09 - i'll just do that right now
86:11 - yes contain save that
86:15 - boom right save that now object fit
86:18 - contain
86:18 - it's still not going to work for a
86:20 - reason because think about this right
86:22 - the width and the height are like this
86:24 - is what the height right here it's right
86:25 - here
86:26 - well we need to tell the image hey the
86:28 - image i want you to be this same width
86:30 - as well so that's how you say
86:31 - height of 100 and then we say what width
86:34 - of 100
86:35 - as well
86:39 - oh
86:42 - boom look at that that looks amazing
86:45 - right so now it's fully contained inside
86:47 - the actual structure so we got that
86:48 - portion guys okay that's so good
86:50 - and next up is what well very simple
86:53 - let's go ahead and add a little bit of
86:54 - padding to the card item so
86:56 - we'll go the cart item container let's
86:58 - do for this one we'll do
86:59 - padding top
87:02 - paying this top is what is how much
87:06 - 12 pixels yeah all right so just move it
87:08 - a little bit okay
87:10 - and then we'll do padding bottom
87:14 - is going to be 12 pixels as well
87:16 - beautiful we got that portion
87:18 - awesome now the pet that does not work
87:20 - make it that makes sense so much now
87:22 - big question okay big question for all
87:25 - you guys all right
87:26 - what do you guys think how do we go
87:28 - ahead and put these
87:30 - in a horizontal fashion right how do we
87:31 - put them in order kind of how we have
87:33 - them here

95:59 - item is there guys
96:01 - what are we going to do right to
96:04 - actually have them
96:05 - work directly with the home page right
96:07 - when you click add to cart
96:09 - or technically add to cart right well
96:12 - how do we make that happen again that is
96:15 - where the database comes in
96:16 - okay let me go ahead and go back to here
96:18 - guys we're doing so much it's insane
96:20 - which is awesome
96:22 - so this is where we will have something
96:24 - called cart
96:25 - items all right and what i want us to do
96:27 - is very simple
96:28 - i want us to be able to when i click on
96:30 - the let's go go to here
96:32 - when i click on add to cart i should be
96:34 - able to
96:35 - add to cart items database
96:39 - right the collection so now what's gonna
96:42 - happen well let's think about this
96:44 - i will go ahead and i will go to the
96:46 - database here
96:48 - good and let's go ahead and do this and
96:50 - now i'll go ahead and create
96:52 - a cartridge yes items that's good
96:58 - right so i will create a collection
97:00 - called card items
97:01 - so let's do a start collection good are
97:03 - you guys ready with this you guys ready
97:05 - guys you guys ready
97:06 - settle down because we're gonna start a
97:08 - new session now at this point
97:10 - and there's this section we are going to
97:12 - add car items to a database
97:14 - and then connect the home page together
97:16 - with the back end
97:17 - understood yes or no comprende
97:20 - compress yes all right
97:23 - [Music]
97:26 - all right yes yes yes yes so okay let's
97:30 - do this
97:32 - cart items boom car items
97:35 - that's going to be the name of the
97:36 - collection okay click next
97:38 - beautiful all right let's go auto id
97:41 - that's going to be our first car item
97:42 - and
97:42 - what are we going to do in terms of data
97:44 - for the card items well uh
97:46 - that's going to be pretty pretty pretty
97:47 - but pretty pretty pretty pretty but
97:49 - pretty simple all right every card item
97:51 - it should have
97:52 - a few different things one it should
97:54 - have is of course an image so we'll do
97:56 - image and let's actually copy the image
97:59 - that we have here so we'll do
98:01 - copy image address okay let's do copy
98:04 - image address
98:05 - let's go to here boom right there boom
98:08 - save that next up it should also have
98:10 - what of course what
98:12 - the title right we'll call it a name
98:14 - let's call it a
98:15 - name or title what do we call the last
98:17 - time we
98:18 - we call it we call it wait we call the
98:21 - title in the app a name on firebase so
98:23 - let's
98:24 - let's go with name name okay awesome
98:26 - let's go ahead and go back to our
98:27 - application
98:28 - we'll go ahead and copy this section
98:30 - that's fine
98:31 - no actually those should be applied pro
98:33 - that should be this one
98:34 - good command c beautiful
98:38 - okay i have a price next up is going to
98:40 - be the price
98:42 - that's a number correct good and the
98:45 - price is going to be which one the price
98:47 - is going to be what 39.
98:49 - 14.49 14.49
98:52 - good next up is going to be what
98:56 - that's pretty much it right pretty much
98:58 - oh no no rating here yeah
99:00 - that's it there's no really but there is
99:02 - something else here guys besides the
99:04 - price
99:06 - right think about this right if we go
99:08 - ahead and go back to our application
99:10 - what do we have well what we have is
99:12 - called something called the quantity
99:15 - you see that oh yeah the quantity so the
99:18 - question that becomes is
99:20 - how do we save how do we keep track of
99:21 - the quantity all the time well that's
99:23 - again
99:23 - that's going to be a database so let's
99:25 - do this quantity
99:28 - and that's going to be a number boom and
99:31 - for now let's just do one
99:33 - so there's one of them right so we'll do
99:35 - save
99:36 - save so look at this now we have card
99:38 - items there's products and there's card
99:40 - items
99:40 - so here's the cool part now what we can
99:42 - do is we can now grab the card items
99:45 - and actually do what use it
99:49 - so now to use it what i will do is i'll
99:51 - go to app.js
99:54 - now because i want to use card items
99:56 - inside the cart and the home
99:58 - i actually want to define it and define
100:00 - this site inside app.js so
100:02 - guys what do you think we're going to do
100:03 - inside the app.js to be able to get the
100:05 - car items
100:06 - just how we've done it before with
100:08 - products what is the first thing that we
100:10 - need to create for the card
100:12 - items what do you think tell me david
100:16 - it's a use date it's something called
100:18 - use state so here's what we'll do
100:20 - that's going to import you state from
100:21 - here voila
100:23 - import you state right there good your
100:26 - state
100:27 - good from good react good
100:30 - now inside here we'll do const
100:35 - const and that's going to be what cart
100:38 - items comma set
100:41 - cart items is equal to use
100:45 - state initially there's nothing
100:48 - understood
100:49 - again that's the state okay now let's
100:51 - create a function called
100:52 - get car item so so const get card items
100:58 - is equal to that's going to be a
100:59 - function
101:02 - good now
101:06 - we're going to use a database now just
101:08 - just how we've done it before so
101:09 - here's we'll do we'll do import db so
101:12 - we'll do import
101:13 - not team port import
101:16 - what are we going to do oh db
101:20 - from what firebase
101:24 - exactamente systematic good comprende
101:28 - good compress base right there awesome
101:30 - so now here's what we'll do we'll do db
101:32 - the collection
101:33 - we'll get the car items collection right
101:35 - here boom right there
101:37 - good awesome good
101:41 - and then we'll do on snapchat just how
101:42 - we did it before
101:44 - good snapshot awesome and there we go
101:47 - let's go ahead now it actually should be
101:49 - a little bit different but it's okay
101:51 - that's fine so we'll do good that's fine
101:54 - it's fine it's fine so we'll do a temp
101:55 - so let's do temp items so const
101:59 - cost temp items okay
102:02 - is equal to what an empty array yep
102:05 - and let's go ahead and save that array
102:08 - so we'll do temp items
102:11 - is equal to what guys is equal to what
102:14 - right
102:15 - what is it snapshot dot what
102:19 - the docs the map just how i did it for
102:22 - the product
102:24 - and for every single what is it
102:27 - question like why don't we do
102:30 - this instead yeah that works too
102:33 - [Laughter]
102:36 - that works too that's fine same line of
102:37 - code
102:39 - right so doc open parenthesis club
102:41 - present and then we'll create an object
102:43 - here
102:43 - and this will be what the id
102:46 - id right doc that id
102:52 - and then the actual what product
102:56 - let's get what dog that data
103:00 - understood boom right there
103:03 - oh don't want that no that's not good so
103:05 - now look at this guys
103:06 - we've got the temp items right there all
103:08 - we gotta do now at this point is save it
103:10 - inside the item so we'll do set car
103:11 - items
103:13 - what is it with what temp items
103:18 - temp items voila
103:22 - amazing job beautiful now again
103:25 - same thing here in order for us to run
103:27 - this guys what do you guys think we need
103:28 - to do
103:28 - well what need to do use effect
103:31 - so do use effect use effect
103:35 - boom boom boom
103:38 - and we'll do get car item so again we're
103:41 - going to call the get car items whenever
103:43 - we
103:43 - load the page or the the component
103:46 - again on the first load so we'll say
103:48 - what get
103:50 - go ahead type it out type it out all
103:52 - right i can
103:54 - type it up or get card what items save
103:57 - that
103:57 - awesome now guys you see this empty
104:01 - array
104:02 - right here the reason why it's empty is
104:05 - because of what
104:06 - is because that's the reason that use
104:09 - effect will run
104:10 - on the first page load on the first
104:13 - rendering of the component right
104:15 - usually you you'll put a variable here
104:16 - for example like items or something like
104:18 - that
104:18 - and what will happen is that use effect
104:21 - will look at this
104:22 - variable and every time this variable
104:23 - changes it will run this
104:25 - right but if we want to run on the
104:28 - initial resolution
104:29 - of the component we put an empty array
104:32 - and then boom use effect now runs and
104:33 - all we do now at this point
104:35 - is what what now whoa well pretty simple
104:37 - we simply do console.log
104:40 - oh yeah log what is it
104:44 - cart it's gonna be card items items and
104:47 - before we go any further
104:48 - um because we were not talking about it
104:51 - but we obviously imported
104:52 - use effect on the very top of the
104:54 - document that's a good point right so we
104:56 - have
104:56 - the import user effect right here guys
104:58 - okay use effect
105:00 - and you state you have to remember that
105:01 - you have the import use effect
105:03 - and to import use date that comes
105:04 - directly from the react
105:06 - library all right just so you guys know
105:08 - beautiful yeah okay good
105:09 - so console.com items and let's go take a
105:11 - look at this now so let's go back to
105:13 - here
105:13 - let's go back to our cart
105:16 - oh voila inspect element and this one

108:00 - do that well we use something called
108:04 - props just as we learned before and
108:07 - what's literally going to happen is that
108:08 - we're going to pass in the car items
108:10 - prop card items
108:12 - literally as a card item so literally
108:14 - what's going to happen
108:15 - this value the data that's in here is
108:18 - going to go into where
108:20 - into here right in the component
108:24 - into the this component understood
108:28 - and then we'll go from here and then to
108:30 - here whoop

108:43 - do we get that data remember how
108:44 - what we did we can get it as props like
108:46 - this
108:47 - or what we can do or we can do
108:50 - or we can do is what we just wanna i
108:53 - mean for now because we are gonna be
108:55 - like throwing the whole thing
108:56 - in uh both card items and card total
108:59 - okay you don't have to destroy it here
109:01 - i mean i'm going to destructure anyways
109:03 - that's fine okay
109:05 - that's fine i want to structure it right
109:07 - someone said he loves that air i'm a guy
109:10 - you have no idea guys when i when i it's
109:12 - very satisfying when i'm actually using
109:14 - the error okay
109:16 - so we'll pass it again so we'll do card
109:18 - items right
109:20 - card items card items you guys don't see
109:22 - it but i'm i'm using the arrow
109:24 - all the time okay exactly so the card
109:26 - items
109:28 - card items so we'll pass it in one more
109:30 - time into the card items
109:32 - as well okay the card.js okay so
109:36 - actually let's call it items for now
109:39 - ah our card items is fine items right
109:42 - there
109:43 - good car items okay so now what do we do
109:46 - let's go to the car
109:47 - item section which is where which is
109:49 - here okay and now let's bring that up in
109:52 - here you see what's going on here
109:53 - you see what's going on here is it's
109:54 - very simple what's going on we have all
109:57 - these components right
109:58 - think about this here's what we did
110:00 - right if you think about this very ah
110:01 - shoot cut items
110:02 - right there here's literally what we did
110:04 - guys
110:06 - if you think about this what did we do
110:08 - well we had this whole application right
110:11 - and what happened is very simple we
110:13 - passed the car
110:14 - items because here we have the cart
110:16 - items think about this
110:18 - our rectangle so let's say this is the
110:19 - car item state correct
110:21 - we passed in we passed it in all the way
110:24 - from
110:25 - what from literally app
110:29 - down to card items
110:34 - now from app down to cart down to yeah
110:38 - car and down to cart items exactly so
110:41 - here's what here's literally what's
110:42 - going on let me show it to you
110:43 - oh boom b right there
110:47 - again from app down to cart
110:51 - down to cart items and that is now going
110:54 - to show us the actual cart
110:55 - in here okay so you see the whole
110:57 - trajectory guys
110:58 - it's a very very very very simple
111:00 - trajectory right very very simple
111:02 - so now with that we can actually use
111:04 - that so here's what we'll do now
111:06 - at this point all i have to do is just
111:08 - simply loop through it
111:09 - by doing the following right so we'll do
111:11 - the following
111:13 - boom card items
111:16 - dot map
111:19 - awesome dumb map say
111:22 - stop that map and what's going to happen
111:25 - now at this point is let's go ahead and
111:27 - get this pom pom pom pom
111:29 - pom pom and then jump jump
111:34 - all right beautiful thank you david

111:53 - itself
111:54 - right and he's going to pass in the
111:55 - whole item but what i want to pass in is

111:58 - in small little details so what here's
112:00 - what i'll do i mean yeah
112:02 - let's just pass in the whole item we can
112:04 - restructure this too

119:34 - that the the add item and that's going
119:37 - to happen
119:38 - where that's going to happen very simple
119:40 - what's up
119:41 - oh yeah yes exactly so if we go to pro
119:46 - that gs there we go beautiful so let's
119:49 - do this right now
119:50 - let's go to prodigy yes product dot gs
119:53 - awesome
119:54 - now right there you see he's already
119:56 - starting on the add to cart function
119:58 - so we're going to create the article for

120:02 - oh great oh good all right it's up again
120:05 - add to cart function amazing beautiful
120:08 - and then this add to cart function we're
120:09 - going to go ahead and save the data in
120:11 - the database right so here's what we'll
120:12 - do
120:13 - we'll do the following we'll do well
120:15 - actually the first thing we need to do
120:16 - is we need to grab the data that's going
120:18 - to come
120:19 - from the actual database so here's we'll
120:21 - do we'll go to cart item
120:23 - is equal to db.collection no hold on let
120:26 - me type let me type
120:28 - okay you type it then
120:32 - give me the collection right look at
120:34 - this
120:35 - add to cart you can do the collection
120:36 - card items
120:39 - card items items
120:42 - dot doc doc id
120:46 - so what is this going to do this is
120:48 - going to create a new document
120:50 - with the id from where from the product
120:54 - you see that guys from the product now
120:57 - what we can do in this case and we'll do
120:59 - a card item
121:03 - dot what dot get
121:06 - to get the actual right so to get the
121:09 - actual uh what's it called now of course
121:10 - we need to
121:11 - import db so do import
121:15 - yeah from what from
121:19 - firebase files all right
121:23 - and then what's going to happen is that
121:24 - after we do this the following
121:26 - the phone is going to happen so the
121:28 - first thing to do is here's the thing
121:32 - we're doing this for a reason okay we're
121:34 - going to grab the current
121:36 - items from the from the database to
121:38 - check if there's already one because
121:39 - here's the thing
121:40 - if this already exists in the cart what
121:43 - shall we do
121:44 - all we need to do is simply update the
121:46 - quantity of it correct
121:47 - not we should not add it we should
121:49 - update the quantity correct so here's
121:50 - what we'll do
121:51 - we'll do we'll get this we'll do dot
121:54 - then
121:56 - okay that then should not do this
121:59 - dot then okay and then inside here
122:04 - let's take a look at this inside here
122:06 - we'll get the document
122:07 - now here's what we can do we're going to
122:10 - say this
122:10 - if the document exists doc.exist
122:17 - meaning it is there it's something that
122:19 - we get from a firebase so that doesn't
122:21 - exist
122:21 - value and that's what we get from
122:23 - firebase right so docked exists
122:25 - we'll default we'll do card item
122:30 - tell what so that update
122:36 - the update right there and what we're
122:39 - going to update with it
122:40 - update it with well pretty much the same
122:42 - thing and the only thing we're going to
122:43 - update however is just the quantity
122:46 - quan t t and that's going to be what
122:49 - we'll do what
122:50 - doc dot data we'll get the data
122:53 - we'll do that quantity this is the
122:55 - current quantity
122:58 - what plus one right there so again
123:01 - what's going to happen guys we get the
123:03 - data from the database right here from
123:05 - car items
123:05 - right so this is for if we already have
123:07 - cart
123:08 - in the car so if this for example item
123:10 - is already in the cart
123:11 - we get it here okay if it exists
123:15 - and i i will show to you how we know if
123:17 - it exists if it exists
123:18 - it's very simple all we do is we update
123:20 - the quantity we get the data for this
123:22 - document
123:23 - right there and we get the quantity we
123:25 - update it and we add one that's pretty
123:27 - much it however else
123:29 - if it does not exist then what do we do
123:32 - we can now create it we'll do
123:33 - the collection collection
123:37 - right card items
123:41 - okay now what the doc
123:45 - will create a new id dot set
123:48 - right there this is how you save new
123:50 - data in the database we'll do set
123:52 - right there boom this is for
123:55 - if we don't have the data in the
123:56 - database we'll do the builder collection
123:58 - car items
124:00 - we'll create a new id for it and we'll
124:02 - save the data so we'll say name
124:04 - okay let's get what the title from the
124:08 - top
124:08 - come what image is the image
124:13 - correct comma what price is the price
124:18 - come on what quantity what is the
124:20 - quantity what do you think
124:22 - when we start out it's one is one
124:25 - because
124:25 - when we add the first time it's just
124:27 - pretty much one that's all it is
124:29 - right that's it so look at this guys
124:31 - this pretty much
124:33 - completes the add to cart function oh

127:08 - we added it
127:09 - to where the fire base so look at let's
127:11 - take a look at this
127:12 - car items boom now we have two things we
127:15 - got the tesla model y
127:17 - and we have what the macbook pro right

127:32 - so look look at this this is amazing
127:34 - we've got the actual car items and so
127:36 - now what's going to happen is very
127:37 - simple guys
127:39 - if i now go to what if i now go to what
127:41 - the actual cart
127:43 - i should see it oh let's go
127:46 - we've got the actual thing right here
127:48 - look at this
127:50 - whoo that is amazing so
127:53 - so so so so good now a few things we
127:57 - want to do
127:57 - you see this right here inspect element
127:59 - you can see it's not really the way it
128:01 - should be
128:02 - so look so now we need to fix this
128:03 - height of the shopping cart

128:30 - the shopping cart now
128:31 - a few things you see how this is here
128:34 - and this is here how do we solve this
128:37 - the reason why this is here is why
128:39 - because of course this tesla model y is
128:42 - a short text and this is a lot and so
128:45 - it's
128:45 - and this is a lot longer so it's pushing
128:47 - this to the side
128:48 - now but how do we solve that and we can
128:50 - solve them very easily okay guys
128:52 - very easily very easily so at this point
128:55 - we're almost there
128:57 - okay how do we solve that very very very
129:00 - simple
129:00 - are you ready for this bro ready i'm

129:07 - yeah yeah yeah yeah so
129:10 - in order for us in order for us to fix

129:21 - this one
129:22 - flags grow so we need to make this dip
129:25 - as it grow as much as possible so for
129:27 - the title let's go the car item
129:30 - car island.js okay let's go the title
129:33 - which is which one

130:02 - look at that look at that
130:05 - so this basically what happened here is
130:08 - very simple
130:09 - guys it's very simple this oh that's
130:12 - really weird what the heck is this
130:14 - so right there this basically was here
130:16 - in this when i said flex grow one
130:18 - it was like you know what i'm gonna go
130:19 - as much as i possibly can
130:21 - pushing everything else to the side it's
130:23 - as simple as simple as simple as that
130:25 - understood yes or no
130:27 - awesome one last thing i want us to do
130:29 - one last thing for today guys we're
130:30 - almost done at this point
130:31 - is i want to uh fix this uh this what's
130:34 - it called this um
130:36 - five i want to make this into an actual
130:37 - select button so let's do that right now
130:39 - you ready for this bro
130:40 - so help me on this one i we need to go
130:44 - ahead and create the select
130:45 - option so let's do this if i go to
130:49 - select
130:50 - what is it
130:57 - all right now instead of having car in
131:00 - that quantity
131:01 - we'll need to change this up guys this
131:03 - is very serious matter understood guys
131:05 - let's do this
131:06 - for this one this needs to be a select
131:08 - button because what is our goal we need
131:10 - to be able to do this
131:11 - right boom select as many quantities we
131:13 - possibly want okay
131:15 - right so i mean there's a limit of
131:16 - course but here's that this is the goal
131:18 - right here
131:19 - right very simple so let's make this
131:21 - work holy look at this this is
131:22 - crazy so
131:24 - i'm the quantity right here's what we'll
131:26 - do let's go ahead and create a select
131:28 - select a button so do select
131:31 - this works just as an html select
131:34 - so you can see right away we have select
131:36 - is not does nothing here but
131:38 - we'll add something here so here's what
131:40 - we are going to do
131:42 - we're going to create an options uh
131:46 - what's it called like kind of like
131:47 - let's think about an options list
131:50 - look at this guys oh look at this so
131:53 - we'll say let options
131:55 - options is equal to an empty array
131:59 - okay empty array and what's going to
132:02 - happen is very simple
132:04 - all we will do is the following we'll
132:05 - create a loop okay
132:07 - it will create a loop and what he's
132:09 - doing here now is we're doing
132:11 - four let i equals one this is a loop
132:12 - guys we're going to start from one
132:15 - and then we're going to continue until
132:17 - what until the max
132:19 - of whatever the number is
132:22 - or or max of 20. so basically
132:26 - we're saying that the max amount of
132:28 - items you can possibly buy
132:29 - is 20 or the current quantity you
132:33 - selected all right
132:34 - so look at this so here while i
132:37 - is less than math.max car either
132:39 - quantity max of
132:40 - the current quantity actually it's not
132:43 - called item it's actually going to be
132:44 - item hold on stop it stop here a second
132:46 - i have that quantity right there good
132:48 - plus one
132:49 - good i plus plus good what we're going
132:52 - to do is
132:53 - options.push and we're going to push in
132:55 - an option
132:56 - value value what
133:00 - value good good good good quantity
133:03 - is going to be i so again it's gonna
133:04 - start from one so one
133:06 - two three and so forth because here's
133:08 - why guys let me show this to you okay
133:10 - let me save this here for a second okay
133:12 - here's why
133:13 - in order for me to do option i do here i
133:15 - do option
133:17 - option good and i do what i do let's say
133:20 - this is a value
133:24 - value is equal to let's say one
133:28 - that's going to be q t y
133:31 - one so right save this boom
133:34 - see you have quantity one that's it we
133:36 - have a select option
133:38 - all we're doing now at this point is
133:40 - converting this into being dynamic okay
133:42 - so
133:43 - it changes so here's what we're doing
133:44 - look at this guys options.push
133:46 - we we have a list of options
133:48 - options.push
133:49 - and basically let's say for example
133:51 - there's uh let's say
133:53 - there's uh let's say let's say this
133:55 - let's say this there's
133:56 - five quantities what we're going to do
133:59 - is we're going to select 20 here so
134:01 - while i is less than 20 we give them the
134:04 - ability to select
134:05 - 20 as a quantity okay and so we're going
134:07 - to create 20 quantities here
134:09 - uh qty i not one by the way bro
134:14 - i oh i wrote one yeah okay that's fine
134:16 - sorry right there
134:17 - awesome okay and then that's pretty much
134:20 - it so now instead of doing
134:21 - here i do options so let's go and save
134:23 - this and look at this
134:25 - wait boom right there we got 20 options
134:28 - right there
134:29 - right but now of course this has five
134:31 - this is
134:32 - one what do we do in that case well
134:35 - what we do no no not that change forget
134:37 - about this for now
134:40 - oh okay what we're going to do is we're
134:41 - going to give the value so look at this
134:43 - i say value
134:45 - is equal to what is equal to
134:48 - item quantity
134:53 - save it boom so look what happened this
134:56 - now quantity right there
134:58 - became one you see and it's selected
135:01 - automatically as
135:02 - five and this one is one because that's
135:05 - our quantity right there
135:07 - understood guys that's pretty much it
135:10 - right
135:10 - that's pretty pretty pretty pretty much
135:12 - it guys that's what literally happened
135:14 - here
135:14 - now let's go and remove this on the coin
135:16 - we don't need this right now
135:18 - okay let's modify this to look a lot
135:20 - better okay so let's go and save this
135:23 - good so we have this select option all
135:25 - we gotta do is simply just modify in
135:27 - terms of how it looks and that's
135:29 - pretty pretty much it and i'll show you
135:30 - exactly how we can do that
135:32 - oh cancel here i want that let's go to
135:35 - our car item quantity container
135:38 - okay let's go down to here car item coin
135:41 - the container where is it
135:43 - right there okay good and what we'll do
135:46 - is we'll
135:46 - do a select select down here okay
135:50 - good select and then select here's what
135:52 - we'll do we'll do
135:53 - number one we're going to do border
135:55 - radius of 7 pixels
135:59 - radius of 7 pixels
136:02 - we're almost done guess that guys so
136:03 - this is pretty cool 7 pixels
136:06 - we'll do background color
136:10 - background color
136:13 - color what oh let's make it like uh
136:16 - let's make this color right here you
136:18 - guys copy this for yourselves okay
136:20 - right there that's the background color
136:22 - okay and then we'll do the following is
136:24 - we'll do
136:25 - give it a padding to make it a little
136:27 - bit bigger
136:28 - padding of 8 pixels
136:35 - oh look at that starting to look a lot
136:37 - better now yeah exactly
136:39 - beautiful beautiful beautiful and then
136:41 - so that's awesome
136:42 - and then what's going to happen is the
136:43 - following right so we got that portion
136:45 - now what i want to do is we'll do a
136:47 - small back shadow to give it a little
136:49 - bit of a box shadow
136:51 - so this will do i'll get got this box
136:53 - right here
136:54 - i'm going to paste it here and boom so
136:57 - this is
136:57 - h horizontal so how does backstage work
137:00 - it's very simple
137:02 - horizontal shift vertical shift and this
137:05 - is the amount of blur you want to apply
137:07 - that's the color that's pretty much it
137:08 - guys okay save that
137:10 - oh let's go and then one thing i want to
137:14 - remove
137:15 - is this thinking purple thing that's on
137:18 - the focus i think right
137:20 - so yeah select select
137:23 - focus focus
137:26 - and i'm going to do the following okay
137:28 - you could put the focus inside of select
137:32 - that's true i will show that to you guys
137:34 - in a second outline none
137:37 - oh let's go that's awesome look at that
137:40 - beautiful
137:41 - right now what he's trying to do is he's
137:44 - gonna show the way this way
137:45 - so he's gonna do remove this focus and
137:47 - he's actually going to put this inside
137:48 - select
137:49 - right here you see and make that right
137:52 - there
137:53 - you can actually do that guys you can
137:55 - nest css basically here
137:57 - and that's only with with style
137:59 - components you can do the end with sas
138:02 - right i can nest things here right
138:04 - select and the focus of select i can do
138:06 - whatever i want here understood
138:08 - so now boom boom
138:11 - that's all i want and guys at this point
138:14 - that is pretty much it one thing i want
138:15 - to do
138:15 - is you see how it's not centered i want
138:17 - to do align item center on the what's
138:20 - on the info bottom so as we'll do
138:21 - display effects we'll do
138:24 - align item center
138:28 - to center them vertically boom you see
138:30 - now they're vertically centered
138:31 - that looks much much much better and
138:34 - that's pretty much it
138:35 - look and the one other thing i want to
138:37 - do is i want to add
138:38 - what i want to add a small line here
138:41 - understood guys yes or no let's do that
138:44 - right now
138:45 - so we'll do we'll go to the container of
138:47 - the car item
138:49 - our item and we'll do a border bottom on
138:52 - pixel solid
138:53 - only like this boom one pixel split
138:56 - right boom and boom that is it
138:59 - we have ourselves
139:13 - guys that is it look at this guys all we
139:15 - do now is go back to amazon
139:17 - let's go ahead and do this let's go
139:19 - ahead and add uh this right here add to
139:21 - cart
139:21 - awesome let's go back to cart oh look at
139:24 - this
139:24 - quantity of one let's remove this tesla
139:27 - model why because we don't need this
139:29 - right now so let's go ahead and go back
139:30 - to our firebase
139:31 - remove tesla model y here for a second
139:34 - so we'll remove this delete document
139:40 - good awesome let's now go back to our
139:42 - thing hey
139:43 - let's go it looks so good guys and check
139:46 - this out
139:46 - now if i go back to here if i click add
139:49 - to cart here again
139:50 - what do i do what's gonna happen very
139:52 - simple now
139:54 - what's gonna happen let me see uh
139:57 - oh at the cart oh look at that you see
140:00 - something's wrong here so let me let me
140:01 - turn it one more time let me go
140:03 - here that's a card here
140:04 - [Music]
140:07 - it's adding multiple so it's not the
140:09 - dock that exists is not doing
140:11 - its its right job so we need to fix that
140:13 - right now
140:14 - let's fix that you see because for some
140:16 - reason let me see
140:17 - so let's think about this let's go back
140:21 - to uh items
140:25 - product product where uh product gs
140:29 - yes awesome so look at this for some
140:31 - reason let's see
140:32 - think about this so doc.id.get
140:35 - and it's not giving the doc so it says
140:37 - um
140:39 - if doc dot exists it should technically
140:41 - update the quantity
140:42 - but for some reason let's think about
140:44 - this so how do we debug this guys what
140:45 - do you guys think the reason why is
140:47 - because again
140:47 - the problem here is it's creating
140:49 - duplicates instead it needs to change
140:51 - the quantity understood
140:52 - yes good so let's think of this let's
140:55 - see number one is
140:56 - the car items what is the id it's giving
140:58 - me so let's do console.log
141:02 - console.log let's do this it's all id so
141:04 - let's think about this because you tell
141:06 - me what do you guys think huh tell me
141:08 - console.log id so now if i go back to
141:10 - here i click inspect them then this one
141:15 - console.log if i click uh refresh this
141:20 - i'm gonna put this on the bottom side
141:23 - okay click add to cart undefined
141:26 - uh-huh okay so what was going on here is
141:30 - we're not passing the id
141:31 - correctly you see right see guys that is
141:34 - good
141:35 - this is right here is really good way to
141:37 - what's it called to debug right so
141:39 - i realized that the id might be the
141:41 - issue here because the id
141:42 - is like if it's not finding the document
141:44 - potential it's because of the
141:46 - id is not correct so where are we
141:48 - passing the id and let's think about
141:49 - this now let's go and save this
141:50 - let's go back to the where we pass an
141:53 - idea and inside the hope that you
141:54 - uh home.js is correct
142:01 - i'm not hearing what you're saying here
142:05 - oh uh so i said oh look at that so
142:08 - before i remove this for a second here
142:10 - look we didn't have this guys you see
142:11 - that's the issue
142:12 - we did not have this so now all we gotta
142:15 - do is do
142:16 - id and go ahead do david
142:19 - okay so we want to pass in the id
142:22 - good that's going to be data.9 data
142:27 - data id good and
142:31 - save that beautiful boom let's do it one
142:34 - more time let's go ahead and remove
142:35 - some of this stuff we don't need this
142:36 - like for example i do not need this
142:38 - i don't need like this stuff delete
142:40 - document from here
142:42 - let's see let's let's remove duplicates
142:44 - okay okay document
142:49 - let's just empty out the whole thing
142:51 - i'll empty it out let's do the document
142:52 - good let's empty it out that's fine
142:55 - boop boop all right this one here

right all right so where are we at right now explain to us david huh so yesterday we have already built the home page with two products which are actually hardcoded uh and we did an amazing job because we get got started with the header yes then we built the content portion of that a ton of stuff with styled components we learned what is negative margin we learned how to make all these beautiful cards and now it's time to level up anytime level up right there okay beautiful so we got that portion i kind of want this okay so that's awesome now what we have right now guys is we have these they are called static images or they're static products meaning this is not dynamic meaning it's like you have to only put it into the into the actual code in order for us to see the actual products as you can see right here correct but what we want to do now is actually connect this to a database because with a database you know it's dynamic it's able we're able to update things we're able to work on things we're able to go ahead and have the cart automatically update as we are working on this so just any database yes a realtime database exactly so the next thing we're working on right now is going to be what is the following so we're going to work on the database at this point so what i want you guys to do is really quickly guys open up firebase okay so let's go to firebase.com right here firebase.com all right let's go to there beautiful i want you guys to log in if you do not have a login i want you to create an account okay and after that let's go ahead and go to console also disclaimer guys if you are not able to for some reason of course if you're not able to for example keep up with me don't worry about it okay this is not the part for this you can always rewatch it later no problem whatsoever right this is not going anywhere so just rewatch it later if you can't just watch this is like a magic show enjoy it participate in the community and that's pretty much it okay but you can but if you can participate with me beautiful all right so let's go and do add project and what should we call this project amazon phone clone let's call it march march 21 mar let's go ahead and do continue beautiful i thought it's like it's a magic show you know what the toilet awesome let's go and i'm gonna list you don't need that necessarily do we need to ah that's fine continue it doesn't matter okay let's go and go to kazzy is that right this one which one do we use uh i think the clever programmer analytics but no i think it don't matter i think it's okay maybe this one i'm not sure it doesn't matter it don't matter that that part it does not matter guys okay all right so it is currently creating your products provisioning all the stuff that we will be using preparing our back end correct correct and so it's thinking okay it's thinking it's pondering it's creating the project it has to create it is thinking it's thing up look at this beautiful okay we got the project ready come on bro can't focus i'm focused i don't know what you're talking about okay all right so look we've got the fires tonight guys as you know the fire store the firebase is a database okay what's a database explain to them so database is basically a very big bucket where you just throw in random data in a kind of like a structured way and then you just use that in several application instances right and you just display that or just work with it right exactly so guys what i want you guys to do really quickly as we're working on this stuff go ahead and smash the like button on this youtube youtube video will help us to feed this youtube algorithm of course i want you guys also very important subscribe for the more videos like this and also also hit that bell notification underneath like do it right now this little bell on youtube so you get notified whenever we go live and you don't have to wait on that you know on the the whole stream the

other than that let's just go so now first things that we need to do is the following we need to go ahead and create connect our account to our project we have the fair firebase i was going to say firebase firebase click on web and we're going to create our web app so we're going to say amazon clone amazon dash clone dash what dash march 2012 21 okay don't worry about the hosting just yet just click register app beautiful and again firebase is free so don't worry about this guys okay you don't need any of this let's go click continue to console beautiful beautiful beautiful that is all good so now we've got that portion let's go to project settings all right and let's go to config you see there's a config right here click on the config portion right there and when you click the config portion you want to copy that portion fully no problem so here's the config portion you're gonna copy it right there so command c copy the config no problem and then what i want you to do is let's go inside our project folder source right there click new file and let's create a firebase.js correct inside here i want you to paste in that that right there the firebase config now and what we're going to do now is now we're going to install firebase in our project very simple right so to do that let's open up our console if you do not have the console open just simply right click on it click open inside integrated terminal and it will open up the console for you i'm going to command kate to clear up my console beautiful very beautiful and then what am i going to do davido you're going to type in npm install firebase dash tools good so we just we have all the firebase stuff for us so npm install firebase dash tools okay this is going to be the tool that you will use for firebase okay come on all right beautiful guys let's go ahead and get to 200 likes guys this will be amazing for you guys go ahead and do that all right 200 likes let's get to it let's get this party party started all right so we've got the firebase tools that's amazing i like it i like it i like it all right so that's installed is there anything else i need to install besides that david uh not really as far as i know no i think we need to install a firebase as well but don't need to just install firebase but also firebase tools because if i so go to if i go to firebase firebase npm let me see so far npm right there let me see yes so we need to install firebase as well so not just tools but also firebase so do npm install i will do firebase so make sure you do that too okay there we go beautiful that's a good song guys so share this video with on facebook on youtube and everywhere that you guys can that'll be amazing all right let's go ahead and continue on so we got the firebase now what we need to do is very simple is we need to now use firebase now to do that all we got to do is you can see davis type is doing import firebase from from firebase right there that's pretty much it okay import firebase and now we're going to use it very simply to use it all we gotta do is do we're going to use the database portion of it so we'll say const db is equal to what david what is it wait wait wait wait we first we need to initialize the application well well technically correct yes so we have the firebase app so what he's doing is doing firebase app is equal to firebase.initialize apps you can see right there initialize app right there you see initialize app right there so firebase equals to initialize app and then we do const db right there let me go ahead and do that there is equal to what firebase dot firestore space.firestore all right that's going to be saved so again just so you guys know okay very very important right there this is the thing firebase initialize app so initialize that app very very important okay so then we're going to do is we will go ahead and export the db portion of you know firebase let's go and save this at this point so we've created firebase we've imported firebase from npm from no modules and just so you guys know a quick little nugget for you okay so make sure you guys remember this all right write this down for you when you do npm install where do you think it installs your packages well they get installed inside the null modules look at you see this all this stuff right here this is a nonmodules folder that's where it gets installed if i go to null modules i can actually find firebase module inside here right there firebase whereas the firebase you see right there all right that's right there you see and that's where all your packages get installed and so now when you do import right there this import it's actually importing from the known modules right there that's just a little bit tidbit for you to know for next time okay good one so we got that portion where uh we are at 188 likes that is amazing now this point all we want to do is is the following so we got the firebase now we need to actually get the data so let's go ahead and do this let's go to our firebase right here and we'll do firestore database that's a database that we will go ahead and use what i want you to do is let's go ahead and do create database okay we'll do start and test mode for now or production mode no let's do test mode for now you want to do test mode because otherwise you will have to mess with the rules and all that stuff yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so cool so let's go click next good uh click next on this one as well click enable let me make sure you guys can see let me remove this so right there enable boom right there good good good good good whoo beautiful so it's thinking it's thinking it's provisioning whatever it's gonna do it's gonna do guys very very important guys we're at 191 likes by the way dude that's insane almost almost at 200 let's go all right so now we have our database no now for a database what's going to happen is a database is a collection it's a it's a it's a list of collections and the collection is like almost like a notebook see this notebook right there there's a collection of pages every single page that you see on here guys is very simply just what it's data right for example data for every single product and so every page that you see here is literally going to be a product think about it like that okay so we're going to start a collection and that collection is going to be called what products product right there oops thank you thank you so let's go click cancel we'll do start collection right here and we'll go ahead and do products okay click next uh click auto id this will create a unique id for every single product it's very simple and then now for every single product there is going to be a field a few fields that we will use and those fields are the following i'm gonna just show it to you so you guys have it guys all right let me see where is the razer bridge okay so the first field is going to be the name the name and what name we're going to put well let's put this name right there let me go to amazon clone let's put this thing right here new apple ipad pro you can put whatever name you want guys okay but i'm going to put this name in here boom that's a string you see next up click another field and we're going to build the field pricing here price beautiful and this price is going to be what a number or string what do you think david 99. it's going to be 14.99 so let's go ahead and do 14.99 no no no four like i mean 1499. so let's do so let's do a number okay because i want to make it into a number and the price here is one four four nine right there so it's going to be one four four nine awesome and let's go ahead and add your field and now for this one this one will be what uh let's see next thing's gonna be your radio rating let's see writing video video so we'll do rating on here and it's going to be a number which is going to be fine let's do five because we love ipad so much oh yeah and then finally it's going to be image so we'll go ahead and do copy image address on this one let's go ahead and do this and we'll do we'll do what should be we'll do image image url and this will be just simply a string and we'll do there here that's the image url so can you maybe copy that image address maybe paste it somehow for you guys you said to me somehow yeah sure i could i could try right here i'd send you on slack beautiful now guys that's pretty much it right there right so let's go ahead and save this at this point boom and boom right there right so what do we have now it's very simple we have a collection of products boom right here and we have one product with this id and this product has an image a name a price and a rating okay that is a database what a database object all right and we can add as many as we want so let's go ahead and add one more guys to this one just so we have something i will go ahead and do what uh a document same thing odd id let's go ahead and do name the string let me do this faster name we'll do the new apple macbook pro right here that's the one let's go back to what uh firebase boom that's the string add field what is the next field we did what is it oh price uh price price number right there the price of this is gonna be one two seven nine so one two one two seven nine beautiful and then finally the next one is going to be what the rating rating correct so we'll do rating and let's show what she'll make it four stars for now yeah we'll do four for now what that should be stars two five stars five every day he's an apple lover too so you know this is he can't blame himself and then finally the last one is going to be an image right there image and that's going to be a string and all i will do is just copy image address on here and i'll paste it into here copy my judges and i'll paste it for you as well so you get so you can have it too nice beautiful beautiful there we go somebody said you guys will be bankrupt if we you guys keep using firebase with so many so many projects nah we'll be fine we'll be fine guys not the end of the world awesome cool so we got that that's let's go and click save oh so now what do we have guys we have product one and we have product two you see those are products okay and the question might be is well how do we get those products into our application well very simple what i want you to do i'm gonna make this a little bit less loud is let's go go ahead and go to home.js and this is where we will go ahead and actually import the products all right so inside home.gs right here what we will do is very simple we'll create a function okay first thing we need to do is we need to import db from firebase remember how we export db let's go into import import db db from what from what from firebase right there that's correct you want to make sure that you're importing it from the firebase.js file instead of the firebase module right exactly 200 plus likes let's go you guys are amazing thank you so much 200 more likes than viewers let's go that's crazy it's crazy crazy so crazy crazy so in the home.js what are we going to create let's go and create a function now now before we create a function to do anything right what i want you guys to do is actually to create a state so what dave is going to going to do is he is going to create product state now what does that mean okay i want you to pay attention here really quickly state in state in react gs is like a database react has its own kind of database it's kind of like it's a snapshot at a certain point in time right so what does that mean well this product is currently initialized to an array right so it's kind of like there this application will have products stored in that app right because we have a database because think about this here's let me let me show this to you okay here if you think about this i'm gonna show this to you yeah yeah good so we have this database right here no no let's go for this so this database okay and that database is gonna be firebase okay firebase and this has rows of data okay and it says rows of data so like one row you know that's these are documents they're called documents you guys know these are products okay so probably one so forth then what do we have is we have what well we have uh a our application correct there we go okay so this is going to be the app correct right there understood so make sure you guys understand this the app and the app of course has different things um let's say it has the header and so forth so let me go ahead and put this to rectangle so let's go ahead it has this right and it has different products one two and so forth right now right how is it supposed to save these products how's it supposed to do that how is supposed to know about these products all the time well what happens is that when we go ahead and pull data from firebase right from firebase what's going to happen is we're going to save that in a state and it's a snapshot and time of the actual application so let's go ahead and do this i will do rectangle and so what's going to happen is this app has a state of products okay so here let me go and say product okay right there oh sorry about the everything all the time and what's going to happen is these products are going to go into a database of the app itself right so let me go ahead and show it to you so it's kind of like this think about this it is a product it's going to go pretty much all the way here right it's going to travel through here and then we're going to save it into the state right there because why if we have it in the state what happens is that using that state we can actually go ahead and let remove me we can actually go ahead and show it on the actual web page right this is the flow get it from a database say it to the state from the state show it on the web page okay that's it and here's the thing every time for example let's say we add a new product okay every time you out to the state guess what react updates the product automatically right so it listens to the state so hopefully that kind of really was a good explanation for you to understand what is state it's a point in time and of course as we add more products right that picture that snapshot changes so we have new products and a product changes and so forth so that is what state is guys does that make sense hopefully all right beautiful whew that was a good explanation i actually enjoyed that [Laughter] i enjoy explaining that guys daniel says where is it daniel what is that daniel says you guys are better than 99 of the teachers from college thank you so much well that actually that that means a lot to us thank you that that's a lot it is is it populating product from the db yes we will do that that's correct it's going to populate the products from the db that is correct wow yes that cool yes that cool that is of course [Laughter] that is beautiful why are we using mongodb or five percent of manga because it's just easier for you guys to trust me okay so guys somebody said you guys make us understand this stuff so easily yeah i appreciate you that's that's always our goal okay so and if we make it a sense if we make it so easy if you understand so please share it guys okay this makes it so easy for us to get out there let's share this because again we're a community we're going to show what we know and how we teach all right so share this everybody i want to see at least one person if you can share it on facebook share this video on facebook if you can share it on facebook screenshot that share send it to me i'll give you some pointers [Laughter] beautiful all right all right so we've got that now how do we do that so we've created a state right here something called using use state that's how we create state and products that can be the process kind of database that i showed you and the set products is a function that we're going to use to change the state so let's say we want to update the state let's say we want to add a new product we're going to use set products beautiful now what's going to happen now this point is the following two two two boom boom boom right there now to do that to go ahead and get this let's go ahead actually before before using use effect let's not use this just yet david okay i don't want to uh get them too complicated i'm going to create a function called const get product okay is equal to we'll create a function right here okay equal to this right inside here we're going to we will use db to get the products right so let's do this we'll do a db ah okay fine david cohen you type so db.collection all right do the collection and we're going to grab the collection of products right so where is this coming from well guys remember right how do we get this well again product you see this collection name that's how we get this right here so to be the collection products okay and then now let's actually grab the documents we'll say on snapshot to grab that document it's saying basically it's very simple grab the documents grab the current snapshot of all the documents and show it to me right there so we'll do this on snapshot voila we'll grab the actual snapshot and then we will go ahead and do something with it now let's grab the actual data we'll do temp products is equal to nothing so initially right to kind of initialize the tempo has to be an empty array and then we'll do the following we'll do snapshot.map yes but before that before we do docs.met let me show this one second here before we do that david let's do console.log console.log console.log right there and we'll do what we'll do snapshot snap shot right there so the log snapshot okay beautiful so look snapshot and i want to show it to you so now of course if i go to my page now okay if i go to my page tab but by the way in order for you guys to start up your page make sure you do npm start like this make sure to make sure you have the page running so do npm start and enter i already done it so i do not need to do it again but look at this hold on david so if i refresh this page nothing's going to happen yet if i remove this get products here okay let's go ahead and inspect down between this one let me put it at the bottom here so we have it go to console here no problemo you see nothing's really happening okay i'm going to clear that this console nothing's really happening but if i do get products products i'm going to call this function right and boom we get something right away you see this right here boom right there we get something we have docs empty query and size i think i'm covering the data here but here we go docs empty data and size and docs is exactly look at this docs has two items remember we had two items two products you see so two items one and second now to get those two items here's what we do we'll do console.log we'll do and the way we get that is very simple we'll do temp products is equal to snapshot right there right there snapshot right dot docs dot what map so we're going to loop through every single dock that we have here you can see there's there's two docks right like i said here inside the docks there's a rate of two the map and for every single doc we'll do the following let me go ahead and do this we'll do doc doc and to get the actual data guys we'll do doc dot data dot dot data but the wait and look at this so dot data and let me go ahead and save this now and now i need to console the log you ready for this bro temp uh it's all ready let's go so i'm super ready i know i'm ready too so right there good so let me go ahead i look at this you ready for this bro look at this i just want to show it to you look at this guys boom look at that look at this one product product number two right there new macbook pro new ipad beautiful and we have a donation holy moly somebody said donation super chat peer character lifting some weights saying keep it up thank you so much appreciate you five dollar donation that is amazing thank you so much that is awesome all right guys so what we have done so far it's crazy we create a database we save the database right it's somewhere in the cloud right it's a database right there we took the data and we showed it here on the front and look at this now we have this data how cool is that guys let me know down in the comments below if you are just as excited if this is like a new revolution for you that you just would in terms of what you just realized right that is amazing i mean that to me that's just crazy right so exactly and the speed that we we we had to just set it up like it was super fast yeah it took us literally literally took us like minutes to do this guys all right no yeah we got these products let's go ahead and change this up just a little bit what i want to do is i don't want to do doctor data i want to actually create a new structure for us i'm going to say i'm going to do like this let me see here so we'll do like the following so we'll do we'll create an object and this object will have an id and the actual data let me do this beautiful so object and the reason why i'm doing this is very simple because i want to be able to reference the id back okay so let you'll see why later on we'll do doc that id comma okay and then the product data will do product and that will be doc dot data data right there dot data beautiful data okay so let's go ahead and what did i do did i do something wrong um doc that id right no no you should be returning it you should be returning an object wait what oh i see why if you're doing that you should you should be going like this you need to put it into a parenthesis like that like the following oh yeah there we go that that's that but we'll return it back right there so okay so doctor id and product.data and that's gonna be 10 products now all i got to do is the following is look at this point is we have the 10 products right here correct now i'm going to save this so we have this thing working beautiful now let's save this into the product state you see save it to the products state let's go ahead and do this so we'll do product state and we'll say the following we'll do set products products okay and we'll do what temp products beautiful 10 products okay save that voila cheeky picky all is picky i know so all right so sad products 10 products that's going to be good and so now look at this the product state has something let me go and do this now gotcha this out get products but now let's go to console.log console.log products you guys ready for this product okay let's see it boom because products all right let's see it let's see let's see let's see let's see it let's see it save it i'm gonna refresh this really quickly i need to refresh it one second here come on come on come on come on oh look at that i mean it's like it's like it's going nuts actually [Laughter] oh yeah because it keeps uh keeps refreshing the state yeah so this is where you have to be very very very careful okay it's now working the way it should for a few reasons oh look at that it's going nuts so this is where oh look at this here's the data look at this guys boom id and the actual data is going to be there too but this is currently a little bit weird and odd for for one reason because the following look at this the issue is now becoming the fact that this right here is being ran too many times yeah it keeps you randomly way too many times all right all right and the reason why is because the this class this function is being rerendered again again by react because of changes that are going on in the actual application to prevent that what we use is we use something called use effect this is called the react hook okay so keep in mind it's called the react hook okay use effect so we'll say this boom boom boom boom let me go ahead and close this up i don't need this use effect right and inside use effect the following will work pew pew pew pew okay good good product good so now to this out right all right what does this do okay before the get products b will be called too many times right because react rerenders kind of you know uh the application every single time there's something that happens on the front end right well here's the thing the problem now becomes is the following the products get called gets called too many times because there's a state that gets changed right and then that changes the state again and so forth and it's a little bit crazy so it's almost like a neverending cycle because look at this we set products here that changes the state because changes state the step product gets called again and so it gets refreshed again now use effect on the other hand what it does is it only makes sure to call this function only once one time and you know when only when the home page is rendered the first time so when i refresh this page though for the first time that's when get product gets called and we can actually check that because i hear what i say check this out i can do console.log call product boom save that okay beautiful all right let me go and refresh this let me go ahead and spec down from this one amazing 268 likes let's go beautiful all right let's go to console log and i want to show you something here see boom right there look at this so look call products you see called product gets called only once after that we can solve log the product and what do we have guys well very simple got the id with the product data for one product and got the id if i put it in another product boom right there right cheeky pinky guys how cool is this right we went from literally we not being able to see products to actually have products from the database which is so so so awesome let me see let me see what do we have here we have some great got some quick comments boom says natalia that's beautiful let me see i remember for the first project i've ever used reg hooks with my team and we couldn't figure out oh let's see so remember the first time uh quick figure use effect to save our lives low we got it by a third project nice well hopefully now you guys understand it okay exactly i think so too when you mount it yes beautiful exactly when the page mounts yes that is correct natalia when the page mounts first you guys are amazing and we're funny i mean you know hopefully you know i'm pretty funny i try to be funny and then you know uh david he's trying to be funny sometimes he's funny suddenly he's not funny so it depends come on someone's like yes nice beautiful so on update what will happen we'll we'll talk about that in a little bit on the update of the products we'll talk about what happens to then okay learning the good the this life cycle hooks helped me understand use effect beautiful david smiles that's all david does he just smiles all right beautiful nice job nice that's what i'm talking about all right so we got that portion here's what i want you to do now guys so we got the products okay that is all great somebody says thanks bro keep it up thank you so much now we got the products in the state the question of becomes is how do we connect this the products to the actual products inside here well that is to be is going to be pretty pretty cool because check this out look at this in the product right here's the product right here and of course product has its own little thing right has its own little thing right there well look at this currently this ipad pro is static that's what we call a static data correct that's called static data guys now to go ahead and actually maybe i can move myself a little bit more here what do you think maybe somewhere in the middle no i'll move it no i'll put it in this in the corner it's fine now to go ahead and you know actually do something about this okay we want the deal to come direct directly from where did david from where we direct we want to commit from the from the state that we just downloaded from right exactly right so this is where johann is saying props for the win so look at this in react.js here's a cool thing you can do you know how we can pass in you know properties or parameters into functions you can pass in parameters into components or it's called props right so here's what we'll do for example let's do product here okay and what's going to happen is here's what we'll do we'll go ahead and do the following i'll do uh well let's go and loop through the products look at this we'll go do like this we'll do products dub map dot map and for every single product boom right there cheeky picky all right product here's what we'll do we're going to get well uh there's gonna be product i'm gonna say i'm gonna say data here data okay okay and the following is going to happen let's go ahead and put this into parentheses like this no that's not what i want good we'll turn this into a product what into a product component but not just a product component right because think about it let me go and remove these products because we don't need these anymore okay think about this you see this still shows up oh you're right there this still shows up butcher this out what i'm going to do now at this point is i will pass in the data of the actual product here's what we'll say i will say title correct david is equal to one david it's going to be equal to data dot uh name but i don't think you need these squiggly braces no it's data.product.name because remember our data has the id and it has a product which has the data about the product okay that's correct yes then we'll do what price is equal to what data the product correct price the price okay next up is going to be what rating is equal to what data the product dot what rating beautiful and finally the last one is going to be which one image and that's going to equal to what product no data.product the product that image product yeah product that image right there beautiful okay and look at this now where is this all going to go because if i pass i say nothing's going to happen just yet if i refresh this again see it's the same thing no problem whatsoever correct but listen up very very closely okay very important okay so look props right what we're going to do is we're actually going to pass in the data as a parameter in something called props and what really props is is it just an object look at this if i do console the log there's nothing fancy about this one here at all look props okay there's nothing fancy at all i do inspect element on this one let me remove my little screen here okay i do consult a log console okay product boom look at this this is props right here right props one props two and look at this all we're passing in is the actual data image price rating and title same thing for the next one image price rating and title see apple mapper pro apple ipad pro that is it guys and this is what props is because we pass it in from where from the product that goes from there that goes to the product correct and the product we get it inside the props which is all it is just a parameter of the function that's pretty much it does that make sense yes or no let me know in the comments below i'm very curious what you guys think about that 291 likes can we get to 300 i would love you guys so much all right let's go beautiful now at this point the few things is going to happen now to get the data you see how he props the image props are title look at this all i gotta do now is change the title instead of doing this guys this is magic this is literally magic all i gotta do is i do props dot what title title title are you ready for this save boom right there cheeky peaky lemon squeezy all right so perhaps the title is right there right away right because where this is what we got perhaps the title again comes from here will be passed into the props this shown here that's literally it guys that's literally it okay then next day is props up price for the rating we will go ahead and take a look at how to do that in a little bit so don't worry about that let's not worry about that just yet but let's do the image now let's do the image now it's going to remove this string image we'll remove that portion right and to map this image what are we going to do we'll do props dot image because it comes from where from directly from here beautiful and then guys that is pretty much boom voila that is it look at this guys this is where it's coming from now we have two products that come directly from a database and this is amazing so what we can now do at this point is very simple if we go to the products section let me go the product here yeah so for the product section all we gotta do now at this point is for the price we could just pass in dollar sign here so we have a dollar here look at that so now we have 1279 1449 that is pretty much it guys who was excited for we just did this is pretty amazing guys let me see amazing teaching thank you guys appreciate you appreciate you boom boom boom i like bro they're catching on onto our little phrases you know thanks david says right holy moly this is awesome that is awesome i'm happy to hear that this was amazing superb natalie says [Laughter] see that's what you did oh my god now everybody over there is going to do it brendan says did not know you can pass props just like that well no yes you can love from pakistan amazing beautiful it was amazing you guys are amazing says let's dance it's okay we'll dance a little bit let's let's go ahead and finish up our product page and maybe we can dance in a little bit okay so don't worry about this wow all right awesome so now the question that becomes is how do we go ahead and create these stars what do we do with this section huh how do we do the stars guys well to do the stars is it's pretty pretty simple i mean yes and no it depends on how how you think about this so to create this how would you how would i do it um we can use something called the array right and when array is the following here's what can do i can initialize an empty array because the star is just number four one or two here i can initialize an array and i can give it a rating so look at this right because look at this if i go take a look at this look at this take a look at this god and just type your penis kind of stuff but it still don't matter look all right if i go to console underneath here beautiful i will say array and let's say i push pass in four see it's an empty array right there it's an empty array of four four it's an empty array basically right there or fourth something now what i'll do is i'll do that fill so i'll do for example array.fail i just wanna should you guys to see this right i'll do array.fail array4 and also that fill but of nothing book so we have four items now there's nothing inside here that's it it's undefined but the cool thing about this is that we can now loop through them four times so if the reading is four we can do four stars here's how we can do that check this out i can do a radar reading four and all i do at this point is well it's it's uh pretty simple i will do the following do that fail dot fill that nothing dot map correct all right let's say it's a rating i just whatever it might be let's just say it's it literally can be nothing i will say you're reading the map but for that what i can do boom and i can put a star well uh to put the star i actually have to put into the ptech so let's do it like this we'll do p and i'll put the star inside here so put the star in here put the start in here put it david good nice job right there nice right there you know oh yeah yeah okay rating is not defined oh wait no prop start reading props stop reading oh yeah let's go five stars exactly look at this five boom five now again it doesn't look as good as you want it but that's only that's when we can go ahead and actually now guys use css to make it actually look proper so what do we do well let's go the way let's go to the rating css let's go do command click and it's a div so to make it go horizontal right in css what do we do what what do we do let's wait for the comments what do you guys think i'm very curious what do you guys think let me see the comments i mean how do you even learn yesterday or not well will you display flex i just did not want to wait i know i know i know but it's okay boom right there we got ourselves the rating that's it guys okay it's coming in good but i want you guys to here we go natala good akash good hector beautiful display flex but guys i want you to pay attention to here are you guys ready are you guys sitting down make sure you guys are sitting down for this okay sit down put your seats put your seats in your seat okay put your no put your butt in your seat look at this i know i know i know so if i go ahead if i click on one of the things i'll change this rating from four from five to four pay attention pay attention guys five to four ready for this boom four stars and you didn't even have to refresh guys how do you think that worked what do you think happened here it's very simple because there's a thing firebase is a live database this gets updated automatically as we update the data inside our database and that is the cool portion okay just so you guys know and that's pretty pretty much it look at this now we have four stars in here we have five stars in here if i change any data here let's say it's one thousand and two hundred ready for this bro ready click update boom 1200 how sick is this guys this is called real time db this is called you have went ahead and created a real world a realtime db database that could fully connect to your application guys you ready for this hey brochure right beautiful we can go ahead and continue on with this you guys want to do dancing you guys got some dancing there we go oh my god that's always so much fun guys so 319 likes guys let's get to 400 that will be amazing i always appreciate you all as always that's going to be awesome so okay now one cool trick i want to show you on here is very simple let me go ahead and save this all right and here's one cool trick you see how we have props and we get the title we get the price and the rating and stuff like this okay in the image well what if i don't want to guys everybody's saying what did we start david so look props is great great great it's great but what i want to do is i want to do something called unpack it right i don't want to use the props variable all the time i can unpack it by use doing something like this look at this pay attention here really quickly here object and now we do title comma price comma rating comma what image actually comma id because we have that too now now of course this breaks yes but what we have done right now is that the title the price what you have done the look at this the props just to give you perspective props was is equal to right is equal to this object that has like the the title and you know and you know the price and so forth right right well what we have done is we unpacked it it's like think of it as like you're going to you know imagine you're like you have a gift right let me imagine there's water right all you want ahead is you you literally uncap the water and you poured out the water and you only you the only thing you're using now is just the water okay or like for example you're all unwrapping a gift right there's the box which is the props the content inside of it that's your gift correct what we're doing is we're unwrapping it that's called unwrapping and so we're simply just getting the title the pripes the writing their image in the id out of it how cool is that understanding i think that's pretty cool honestly so let me go ahead and save this beautiful i'm going to save that portion and look at that it still works no problem all we've done is we unpacked it unpack the thing here and we did not need to use props dot something here at all all we did is we simply just took the data out of props we got it okay what oh my god there you go someone said you can spend you get the url from there yes beautiful explain so well thank you gary gary smith awesome i'm glad that you enjoyed the explanation guys all right that's not pro that's producto somebody said yeah david says you're rock man thank you so much guys all right so we got that now on the product side we're pretty much done all right that's the product that's amazing now what this said what should we do now look at this we have the products all good no problem whatsoever i want to want us to work on the next thing which is going to be what which is going to be the card so we've got the product section great that's kind of the database let's now work on the card section okay that's gonna be a little hard now because this is now a css portion of this section okay all right all right let's go ahead and uh well somebody says amazing guys thank you thank you cheeky pikachu yes all right a few things uh well we have the card here it's empty right now don't worry we'll fix that in a second let's go ahead first thing you want to do is i want to change this number four to have the orange color just how we have it inside here this orange color i will inspect them on this one what is the color for this one it's this font weight 700 and color this color so let's go ahead and do that in our actual application uh and to do that we'll go to google home.js now let's go product save the product go to this and what i want to do is i want to go to header.js beautiful and where is our actual cart that is the card count i will do command click or control click on your application or on your thing and i'm going to pass then pay past and paste in font weight 700 and color is that understood comprende cheeky piggy cheeky um somebody says thanks for teaching us guys love you love you guys too much as well as always all right so boom we say that that's awesome and look at this now we have the color here right there awesome now let's now go to the card and let's now focus on the actual card itself okay we have the card.gs in here okay cut that gs now the card if you think about this is going to be what well let's think about this here all right where's our card well a few things here's our cart all right uh no that's not the card this is the card right there and the card comprises of two things guys what do you guys think it comprises off well one thing is going to be shopping cart or i like to call it card items and the second thing is going to be the card total okay so card items and let me go and put this on here cart items cart items and then cart total beautiful right there so two components okay what i've just done for you is i've divided this into two components so you can see it fully understood comprending peaky i gotta stop saying that [Laughter] no it's okay it's all good i know i know but awesome so that's all good so it's two items now in the car that's exactly what we will do so let's go ahead and click create the container first so go ahead and do that uh for us beautiful container so what david is now doing is creating a styled that day of container right there okay just how we always do it so you guys know exactly right there beautiful and he's done it inside here as well understood of course understood all right all right next up is going to be the card item section so we'll create a component called card items and a second component called create card total all right so now beautiful beautiful beautiful let's go ahead and create those specific components inside here let's go to source and we'll do new file we'll do cart items.js voila good and got it what's up i already got it oh man too fast too fast too fast i'll let you do the other one okay where's the card items bro i don't see you on here wait wait let's refresh refresh i don't see items on here no you disappear bro okay never mind i'll create a new file cart items dot gs okay i'll do rfce to create the component nice job that's going to be card items okay and then finally the next is going to be what's the card total card total yes and that can be rfce as well awesome so we have that portion that's good that's good it's good it's good okay that's amazing and that's gonna be the cart total total section all right understood everybody understands of course comprende comprendes so card total and so these are the two components that we'll use basically now the question that becomes how do we go ahead and actually you know change up these components what do we do with them in terms of you know actual width and height and so forth well a few simple things for the card items let's go ahead and do this let's create a container so maybe can you add style components to this one so container of course good so what david is doing now is he's adding style components right there beautiful yes oh my god what's up everybody's saying holy moly what did you do now i don't know what i do everything is happening so that's gonna be the container for the card items and let's go and go to cart total and do the same thing here so let's do cart container container right there oh boom same thing here container right there beautiful and we'll do cons container equal styled i got it david okay okay okay sorry about that style that div okay awesome so container no i spelled that wrong don't judge me guys it's all good if you judge me if you judge me i'm okay with that i don't care wait too much all right beautiful so however it's like comprende yes [Laughter] somebody said you guys somebody said you guys get everything boom all right so that's two items so we have card items and card total right so those are the ones we've created and if we go to our actual application which is this one right here right let's couldn't actually import them now so we'll go to the uh card section let's import them right so go ahead david and report those card items card total go ahead david i'm just wait wait wait wait so what do we what do we do i'm going to import import card items oh hold on items from what cart oh so funny you guys decide we're typing at the same time guys how cool is this how cute and i'm faster that's fine all right so look at this card items and card total right so beautiful all right now now let's think about this so so now we have those two components one and two all right now somebody said it's right somebody's already saying the answer to what we're going to do now next is because you know now we want to make them side by side to make them side by side what do we do guys well pretty simple it's display flex flex now before i do that let's do this what are we going to do display display flex well a car items and car total are pretty much there but we're not done either yet because why tell me why i mean we need to drop in the items that we are actually purchasing good good and then what and we will need to pass them into card items and card total good yes but that's not it guys this is not it what i want us to do is very simple i want to define what it means for our card items the card total so look at this display flags is all good but i will go to cart items let me go ahead and save this card items i would say this container i'm going to give it a height for now just temporarily okay i'll say height of let's say 300 pixels okay and what i'll do is i'll do background color color let's say white right now good background color white okay so you can see right there boom white is the color that we just got right there awesome that's car items okay all right the card total same thing here card total where's the card total right there card total same thing here right i'll give it a height of now 200 pixels right but the background color is also white correct white amazing beauty white did i say that right i think so yeah background color white awesome so look at this now we have those two items guys all right this one and this one now here's what we do at this point okay very very simple all right let's go to uh card.js gs and i want to find the card items to be to take up 80 of everything so what i will do is very simple i will go to card audience gs and i will say flex 0.8 boom so what this is going to do is hey the importance of the cart item section is actually how much david so the card items is now going to take up uh 80 of the space that both of the two both the card items and the card total had exactly exactly and then what do we have at this point is the card items takes up 80 and how much do you think the cartridge will take up i mean the car total is only taking up as much as it needs so it is just the minimum require man but it has 20 percent the room yes so what i will do is i'll go now to cart total and i will give this one a flex of what 0.2 0.2 done now again we're not done yet because now let's go ahead and add some penny because i want us to have the to have padding and i want this to look nice all right so what i'm going to do is i will add well i will add margin right of 18 pixels to everything to the card item section so margin margin right right of 18 pixels all right good nice you see they added some padding margin to it good and i want us to to have now as well is well let's go ahead and go to the cart inside here and i'm going to give the card also some padding so cards because the card is which one the card is this part is the right that's the whole thing that's the card right so i'm going to give the padding we'll say padding let's do the whole trouble thing remember this one so oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so we'll do what we'll do top is 14 pixels yeah good good so we'll do top is 14 pixels okay right is going to be 18 pixels okay 18 pixels okay bottom is going to be zero and then left is going to be what i'm not sure 80. okay that looks good boom voila look at that guys now we have ourselves a beautiful much better carter correct right correct of course correct beautiful awesome so that is good now let's go ahead and add some padding on the inside of it as well because you see how it's just kind of like it's wonky you see it's i wanted to be to create some padding in there as well so what i will do is i will do card items let me go ahead and do this and save that go to cart items and we'll do padding of 20 pixels correct okay save that hey there we go for the card total shall we do the same yeah for starters no we will just adjust i think so too so do card total we'll do padding 20 pixels yes alrighty i like it i like it uhhuh [Laughter] all right so what do you guys think so far who's still with us guys let me know in the comments below who is still with us natalia says the trouble helps so much that's awesome let's see play song yo boy good does i always just thought clockwise for padding trouble is better yes loved it learning a lot with you guys i appreciate it yes yes yes yes yes top right and bottom left exactly good good good good good damn it i missed the part one part three nice job guys good amazing job cool so okay we've got the card total we've got this now what are we going to do is let's focus just on the card item section okay should we do that bro okay we should do that all right the card items are going to have a few things number one is what does it have well if you look at it we have what the shopping cart and then we have a line and then we have the actual product of the card item itself all right so now let's do that okay let's do the title good let's go to the shopping cart all right so typing shopping cart in there that's gonna be what we're going to paste and that's this one correct and then we'll do the hr so hr just simply stands for the line so horizontal line or it's called horizontal ruler i think it's what it's called beautiful i thought it was horizontal that's why it's hr okay no no no i think it's a horizontal ruler okay and then finally the last one is going to be which ones the actual items div that's going to create have the actual components all right so let's do items items got items container right the condensed container is going to be what guys so let's think about this just so we have here for a second all right if you think about this this right here is what this is the items container you see then what we have then we have the shopping cart oh the shopping cart is this one of course the line is that that's pretty much it understood comprende one day good all right now the question that becomes is what how do we know what do we do with this now like how do we supposed to do all this stuff right here i really don't know right again very very very simple let's do this guys let's do this right so what i want to do now with you guys is what's going to happen is this is going to be called what should we call this now right this should be a component correct yes or no what do you guys think tell me that big component i think so right well let's actually make into a component and the component is going to be called what it's going to be called card item voila cool so cart item all right so you can see what i'm doing is i'm creating these components i'm not worrying so much about passing the data and nothing so much at all i'm just creating the components that's pretty much it okay so card item let's not create that so let's go ahead and create the card item component uh david i'll let you do the do this one as well do this one by yourself create the item component so do that create the card item component you do it doing it oh yeah it says running file create participant so it should be doing it let me see item component refresh my page i don't see your card component bro nah it's something something with uh with vs code that's fine all right that's fine so i'm going to do a new file here yeah yeah i get to use it now you look i get the control so wait wait wait there it is there it is you have it now oh let's go beautiful so card on the gs they will type in rfce nice we gotta sell the component beautiful nice job good and so what's going to happen is he's going to import style from style components nice job and then i'm going to convert these divs to containers there contain this boom right there so do container container container amazing amazing amazing amazing awesome work huh teamwork team working dude powerful teamwork let's go good so we got the container now this is going to be a individual card item so i'm gonna just say card item in here so you guys can see exactly what we are using card item okay so we've created the card item make sure you do the inside the source folder okay very important and let's go back to card.js now let's go back to cart items that's what i want to go back to come on items right there all right so let's go ahead and do command b to remove this that the thing let's go to our application and car item is not defined and because we need to import it so we'll do import cart item from what is a cart i've got this dave if i'm typing i'm typing [Laughter] this guy this guy just wants to just type every single time i don't understand it all right so card item is there awesome sweet now the question that becomes is let's go ahead and now change this card item to have the exact things that we need to have it well a few things are going to be so if you think about it let's go to cart item so what do we have in this car item how are we going to divide this up into rows and columns right you tell me david all right so we will have two divs at the top level one of them is going to contain the image which is going to be one div that's our item so we're going to have what image yeah yeah we are going to have an image and then on the right hand side we are going to have the rest of the stuff so well actually a few things we're going to have what not just that but we're going to split this up into the info right here info yeah exactly that's good the price so oh so you want to go that way yeah so three components three components why here's why because i see things in rows and columns okay so i want you to pay attention to this really quickly guys you can see right you can see here that right this is one component good this is another component good and this however because it has this and this inside of it right it has two horizontal components along with one a vertical component the way i see right away i need to combine that into one container right because if i do that what's going to happen what's going to happen then if i do that what's going to happen and i can i'm going to put a rectangle here i can split this up into a component here and put this opposite component here right and then what's going to happen is because of that i can make these horizontal and this can still be component than another component understood so hopefully you guys get that portion because that's a really interesting portion that's how you you want to think about every time that you go ahead and you think about how to build things with components or just in general in the in you know any web application rows and columns rows columns rows columns keep that in your mind okay rows columns rows columns and rows and columns and rows and columns and rows and columns and rows in case you see people dropping rows and columns in the chat i know right but that's good i want them to think about that so let's go to cart item all right the first thing that we said is going to be what is going to be the image right so it's going to create the image container right so we'll do image container here it's going to create the image container and again here i'm going to map exactly what you're doing to an actual so let's do image container everybody's saying that's so interesting that's so cool awesome guys that makes me happy you guys are getting this okay so again this image container that's going to be there right there good good good good good then the next one is going to be something called the the info right so that's going to be the info shortcut for that works as well good that's going to be this portion right here the whole this uh this whole thing that's the card item info right oh sure what just happened right that's gonna be where that's gonna go into the car item info good good then there's car item what in for what top and bottom because again that's the top this is the bottom section good card item let's make it what the quantity good so then the quantity right here that's going to be this section right here what item delete boom right there good so then we have what the quantity contained because you think about the bottom right is its own little dip correct if you think about this and the bottom has quantity and then delete good and then finally let's go ahead and make the third one let's go ahead and make the third component that's gonna be the price one so that's gonna be the uh price all right so we'll do card item price good that's going to be this div right here whoop boom right there awesome i actually would have included carter and price in the info whatever no i don't know that wouldn't work actually you'll you'll see why later that would not work because because now that wouldn't work actually you know that would be bad okay no matter don't worry all right time for this right good so look at this guys do you understand this yes or no like the way we just style these components when we put this component it's for for a reason correct it's always for a reason so let's now think about this all right let me go ahead and remove these now good now let's actually put the data in so the image container that's going to contain what well let's go ahead and actually create image so we'll do image source is equal to something let's go ahead and make that image source right now again we'll make it static so i'll do copy image address and i'll put this in here and then we'll close out this image okay no need for that image right now okay beautiful that's the image container next up we have what uh the car item info that can be the top so we'll put this in here i see each side here and this will be an h2 so let's put it inside the h2 so we'll do h2 that's a heading two so we'll copy that portion good go ahead so that's in h2 and then finally then the quantity let's not focus on that so much there let's do like five or something like that let's not focus much on that right now but the delete container let's just say delete on here okay delete and finally the price is going to be 14.49 good good so we'll save that we'll save the card items good good good good good it's good you got that portion bro awesome beautiful so now guys all right car items now individual card item is going to have some really really really really really really really interesting stuff all right first things first let's go and take a look at it oh style undefined okay where is it style oh look at that he create all the style stuff nice job go and refresh this no problem oh let's go that's so beautiful look at this it's completely havoc okay don't worry about this gotcha gotcha okay let's i think it looks good i mean it's okay so it's okay it's all good so here's what i want to do here's what i want to do for because the reason why it's so big is because again this image is trying to take as much space as it possibly can so what do you guys think we need to do right now to fix that well we need to go the card item image container or is the image container right there okay let's create this container let's give this container an actual like width right let's say let's give it a width i'm going to say width of 180 pixels and 80 pixels okay and then height of 180 pixels right there beautiful right so that's all good i like that portion let me go ahead and oh look at that you see now some things have shifted but again that's completely okay right now for the actual image now what we need to do is we do object fit contain let's do that right now good height we can do an object just do i'll just do that right now yes contain save that boom right save that now object fit contain it's still not going to work for a reason because think about this right the width and the height are like this is what the height right here it's right here well we need to tell the image hey the image i want you to be this same width as well so that's how you say height of 100 and then we say what width of 100 as well oh boom look at that that looks amazing right so now it's fully contained inside the actual structure so we got that portion guys okay that's so good and next up is what well very simple let's go ahead and add a little bit of padding to the card item so we'll go the cart item container let's do for this one we'll do padding top paying this top is what is how much 12 pixels yeah all right so just move it a little bit okay and then we'll do padding bottom is going to be 12 pixels as well beautiful we got that portion awesome now the pet that does not work make it that makes sense so much now big question okay big question for all you guys all right what do you guys think how do we go ahead and put these in a horizontal fashion right how do we put them in order kind of how we have them here right from left to right what do we do guys i'm sure you guys know the answer to this guys let's what is the magic word that we got well that is display flex that's pretty much pretty much it big boom boom i like it that's display flex hey everybody knows just flex at this point that's that's amazing awesome so we got that section good good good good so now if we go back to our page oh would you look at that right i know i know i know i know i know that's amazing right so okay so that is all good i'm very happy with the specific section let me go and do this okay don't worry about anything else here we'll go we'll go ahead and figure this portion out together all right now card item info for now let's work on the title so we have this title right here it looks a little bit odd let's work on the title card item info that's the top section correct info top let's give this some kind of a color we'll give this a color of this color right here boom that's gonna be this color right there nice that's that color that's awesome and now now next thing you see again you see this the card item info bottom again five is here at least here how do we put them horizontally guys again what is the answer yes well that that's a good answer too but we'll do this one for now so we'll say display flex on this one yeah good okay if now five and delete are there beautiful now for the font size for the info title i want to do the following so i'm going to say the following let me see so this is uh with the title here that's h2 info top so we'll see each two on here and we'll give this one a font size of what of 18 pixels font size of 18 pixels god save that boom all right next up the um let me see what else do we need to have we got that portion we got that portion i like it now the action section okay this right here is called where is it item.js this is called what no that's not it where is it car info bottom the car bottom yes that's gonna that's gonna have a margin top look at this guys that's going to have a margin type of before pixels let's go item wait wait wait wait wait yeah let's do this margin top add some space into it four pixels good good so right there let's add some margin now here's a big question for you guys how do we go ahead and make this div basically like right for some reason this this image gets shrunk every single time why is that how do you think as we fix that how do we how should we fix this issue right here the fact that this image right here gets shrunk for example right so like is that again as it gets bigger it gets bigger but then it shrinks what do you think we need to do you tell me what do you guys think huh what do you guys think you tell me people are coming with facts that's no not necessarily what do you guys think i want you i want you to think about this well it's actually something use something called flex girl and flex shrink so if i go to my for example my image right no not max width no necessarily so look at this guys let's go to my image where's my image here right here i will need to tell that hey flex shrink zero boom right there you see that so what does this mean this means that you should never shrink the size of this container never shrink it okay then again also never grow it so say flags grow also zero instead only keep it as this width that's pretty much it oh look at holy do you see this bro look you see how it just added an error how did you do that click come option sorry about that i just realized that it's a lot of fun go option that's so cool okay sorry whoa so guys see that right there right you see this right here look that's whole that's so cool oh my god that's so cool this is a total game changer now i know that not that portion [Laughter] guys awesome awesome so look at this we've got flex growth zero and so forth right so that makes makes this other stuff fit in so good good awesome now 1449 right let's think about this one 4249 let's now style this portion okay for the fortune 49 it's pretty simple all i gotta do at this point is what is for the give us a font weight so let's do let's go to this one so item price right there so here's we'll do we'll do font size font size what are 18 pixels guys of 18 pixels right there boom save that awesome make it a little bit bigger we'll do font weight of 700 of 700 good awesome and finally we'll do margin left 60 pixels right there margin left give it some spacing god awesome sweet i like it i like it i like it so that's all good so we got that portion now let's focus on this delete i want to make this delete it will look a little bit a little bit better that's going to make it look like a little bit cleaner i would say so so here's we'll do for the delete section lead container let's do this one guys and see again again we're just coming one by one little by little little by little that's how we're doing this let's do delete container we'll do color the same color as which one as the title which should be where this color good so that's the car of the container so save this one oops nope done save that okay good i like that and then his will do we will do for this one delete container got margin left that's good pixels that's awesome good and then we'll do cursor pointer because third pointer that sounds good too cursor pointed guys we are at this point at 393 likes thank you guys so much for sharing for caring and for being the amazing people that you are guys let's continue sharing this guys get this out to as many people as possible because again we're just having fun with this we're learning most importantly right it's a it's a great you know it's a great thing for everybody to learn it's always amazing so guys hit the bell notification make sure you share this video right hit the like button let's get to 400 likes that will be amazing i will love you all i mean i love you all you know in either case but that'll be awesome cool all right now now let's focus on this select option this but actually no before we do that i want to focus a little bit on the javascript portion so here's what you got so far all right one actually before this move on let's go ahead and uh it's because i'm i'm ocd like this way uh i like i want some space in here so let's go ahead and do margin right can we argue much right 16 pixels to the actual image so we'll do margin right margin margin margin that's right 16 pixels nice look at that much better i'm so much happier now god i know i know i know i know that's just how i am you know so cool that is amazing oh boom holy we got 418 likes oh 411 that is amazing you guys are awesome thank you so much all right got that portion now let's think about this look at this we've got the cart items that's there all right how do we now go ahead and actually show them how do we add them that's a good question right the car item is there guys what are we going to do right to actually have them work directly with the home page right when you click add to cart or technically add to cart right well how do we make that happen again that is where the database comes in okay let me go ahead and go back to here guys we're doing so much it's insane which is awesome so this is where we will have something called cart items all right and what i want us to do is very simple i want us to be able to when i click on the let's go go to here when i click on add to cart i should be able to add to cart items database right the collection so now what's gonna happen well let's think about this i will go ahead and i will go to the database here good and let's go ahead and do this and now i'll go ahead and create a cartridge yes items that's good right so i will create a collection called card items so let's do a start collection good are you guys ready with this you guys ready guys you guys ready settle down because we're gonna start a new session now at this point and there's this section we are going to add car items to a database and then connect the home page together with the back end understood yes or no comprende compress yes all right all right yes yes yes yes so okay let's do this cart items boom car items that's going to be the name of the collection okay click next beautiful all right let's go auto id that's going to be our first car item and what are we going to do in terms of data for the card items well uh that's going to be pretty pretty pretty but pretty pretty pretty pretty but pretty simple all right every card item it should have a few different things one it should have is of course an image so we'll do image and let's actually copy the image that we have here so we'll do copy image address okay let's do copy image address let's go to here boom right there boom save that next up it should also have what of course what the title right we'll call it a name let's call it a name or title what do we call the last time we we call it we call it wait we call the title in the app a name on firebase so let's let's go with name name okay awesome let's go ahead and go back to our application we'll go ahead and copy this section that's fine no actually those should be applied pro that should be this one good command c beautiful okay i have a price next up is going to be the price that's a number correct good and the price is going to be which one the price is going to be what 39. 14.49 14.49 good next up is going to be what that's pretty much it right pretty much oh no no rating here yeah that's it there's no really but there is something else here guys besides the price right think about this right if we go ahead and go back to our application what do we have well what we have is called something called the quantity you see that oh yeah the quantity so the question that becomes is how do we save how do we keep track of the quantity all the time well that's again that's going to be a database so let's do this quantity and that's going to be a number boom and for now let's just do one so there's one of them right so we'll do save save so look at this now we have card items there's products and there's card items so here's the cool part now what we can do is we can now grab the card items and actually do what use it so now to use it what i will do is i'll go to app.js now because i want to use card items inside the cart and the home i actually want to define it and define this site inside app.js so guys what do you think we're going to do inside the app.js to be able to get the car items just how we've done it before with products what is the first thing that we need to create for the card items what do you think tell me david it's a use date it's something called use state so here's what we'll do that's going to import you state from here voila import you state right there good your state good from good react good now inside here we'll do const const and that's going to be what cart items comma set cart items is equal to use state initially there's nothing understood again that's the state okay now let's create a function called get car item so so const get card items is equal to that's going to be a function good now we're going to use a database now just just how we've done it before so here's we'll do we'll do import db so we'll do import not team port import what are we going to do oh db from what firebase exactamente systematic good comprende good compress base right there awesome so now here's what we'll do we'll do db the collection we'll get the car items collection right here boom right there good awesome good and then we'll do on snapchat just how we did it before good snapshot awesome and there we go let's go ahead now it actually should be a little bit different but it's okay that's fine so we'll do good that's fine it's fine it's fine so we'll do a temp so let's do temp items so const cost temp items okay is equal to what an empty array yep and let's go ahead and save that array so we'll do temp items is equal to what guys is equal to what right what is it snapshot dot what the docs the map just how i did it for the product and for every single what is it question like why don't we do this instead yeah that works too [Laughter] that works too that's fine same line of code right so doc open parenthesis club present and then we'll create an object here and this will be what the id id right doc that id and then the actual what product let's get what dog that data understood boom right there oh don't want that no that's not good so now look at this guys we've got the temp items right there all we gotta do now at this point is save it inside the item so we'll do set car items what is it with what temp items temp items voila amazing job beautiful now again same thing here in order for us to run this guys what do you guys think we need to do well what need to do use effect so do use effect use effect boom boom boom and we'll do get car item so again we're going to call the get car items whenever we load the page or the the component again on the first load so we'll say what get go ahead type it out type it out all right i can type it up or get card what items save that awesome now guys you see this empty array right here the reason why it's empty is because of what is because that's the reason that use effect will run on the first page load on the first rendering of the component right usually you you'll put a variable here for example like items or something like that and what will happen is that use effect will look at this variable and every time this variable changes it will run this right but if we want to run on the initial resolution of the component we put an empty array and then boom use effect now runs and all we do now at this point is what what now whoa well pretty simple we simply do console.log oh yeah log what is it cart it's gonna be card items items and before we go any further um because we were not talking about it but we obviously imported use effect on the very top of the document that's a good point right so we have the import user effect right here guys okay use effect and you state you have to remember that you have the import use effect and to import use date that comes directly from the react library all right just so you guys know beautiful yeah okay good so console.com items and let's go take a look at this now so let's go back to here let's go back to our cart oh voila inspect element and this one console and where is it nowhere oh it's right here oh luca douche the price the apple ipad pro that my friends is the car items huh but the quantity of one how sick is that we literally went to a database again same thing here database right then what happened well we got database got the app right that's gonna be the car items right here card items items right again what boom i'll do rectangle that had had the state right if you do the brush went to the state the state showed it on right it's going to show it now on the actual formula webpage understood yes or no yes yes yes indeed nice so that is all good i like that question huh real quick before we go any further natalia says wow nas thanks uh i've never really understood use effect exactly first time i really get it so that's just something yeah let's go that's amazing i'm happy that you understand this yes thank you yeah sometimes it's hard i don't know why it's these things like that that you know it's um i don't know because when you read it online it sounds so complicated but really it's not you know yeah so i'm happy you got that that's awesome i know right somebody says that's crazy web dev coder keep coping i guess just keep coding maybe somebody said perfect use use f set like you said and then we shouldn't say it and then we should awesome says natalia awesome sweet so look at that we got the cart items now now here's a question guys here's a question to you right how do we get the car items guys if you guys love this so much then just like it like if you guys that's the only way i'll know that you like it you know you like it i could like it like this video you know let's get to 500. you guys got this come on come on get your friends get your family your brother get your sister how are you god just you know right there awesome exactly all right so here's a question to you right how do we get these car items from here down to the cart what do you guys think down the car right because we should be able to show this right inside here right so that's the whole goal right so how do we do that that's a good question right how do we do that how do we do that well we use something called props just as we learned before and what's literally going to happen is that we're going to pass in the car items prop card items literally as a card item so literally what's going to happen this value the data that's in here is going to go into where into here right in the component into the this component understood and then we'll go from here and then to here whoop the discovery of the day i know sorry it's just so much fun guys all right so now we got the car items let's go to card now so we're in cart now how do we guys how do we get that data remember how what we did we can get it as props like this or what we can do or we can do or we can do is what we just wanna i mean for now because we are gonna be like throwing the whole thing in uh both card items and card total okay you don't have to destroy it here i mean i'm going to destructure anyways that's fine okay that's fine i want to structure it right someone said he loves that air i'm a guy you have no idea guys when i when i it's very satisfying when i'm actually using the error okay so we'll pass it again so we'll do card items right card items card items you guys don't see it but i'm i'm using the arrow all the time okay exactly so the card items card items so we'll pass it in one more time into the card items as well okay the card.js okay so actually let's call it items for now ah our card items is fine items right there good car items okay so now what do we do let's go to the car item section which is where which is here okay and now let's bring that up in here you see what's going on here you see what's going on here is it's very simple what's going on we have all these components right think about this here's what we did right if you think about this very ah shoot cut items right there here's literally what we did guys if you think about this what did we do well we had this whole application right and what happened is very simple we passed the car items because here we have the cart items think about this our rectangle so let's say this is the car item state correct we passed in we passed it in all the way from what from literally app down to card items now from app down to cart down to yeah car and down to cart items exactly so here's what here's literally what's going on let me show it to you oh boom b right there again from app down to cart down to cart items and that is now going to show us the actual cart in here okay so you see the whole trajectory guys it's a very very very very simple trajectory right very very simple so now with that we can actually use that so here's what we'll do now at this point all i have to do is just simply loop through it by doing the following right so we'll do the following boom card items dot map awesome dumb map say stop that map and what's going to happen now at this point is let's go ahead and get this pom pom pom pom pom pom and then jump jump all right beautiful thank you david you're the best my friend so then we'll do item item no holy moly item holy guacamole i know all right so item so what he's going to do now is he's going to set the prop for what for the actual what the item itself right and he's going to pass in the whole item but what i want to pass in is i actually want to pass in small little details so what here's what i'll do i mean yeah let's just pass in the whole item we can restructure this too like no no no no no no don't don't don't do that yeah don't do that not yet not yet yeah i don't want to confuse them too much okay okay okay so here's what we'll do now we do this let's go ahead and pass and also the id because i'm going to use the id later on as you guys can see i will do item dot id oh i think i know what you want huh i think i know what you want so instead of item you want to pass in name yeah yeah i was thinking that but i think it's fine for now i think this is fine that's fine so we'll do item and then we'll do id that's completely fine no problem right so guess that we got the id we got what the product guys all right understood and so now inside what inside the cart item it's very simple very simple now all i gotta do now would i just delete i delete something i don't want like that all i gotta do now is go to car item and now inside here let's destructure it again we'll get the id comma what item comprende good good and now let's get the actual item what data right so let's go ahead and do this for the image what was the image remember this guys what do we ah shoot no that's not what it was right there awesome and we'll do what what is it item dot image i think yeah i think it is item that image okay good let's go ahead and save that awesome next one's gonna be what the item is what item that name correct god nice job david so we do item dot name nice good good good and then the final the last one is going to be the under quantity so the item the what quantity and then the last one is going to be what the iron price so we'll see what item dot price amazing beautiful i end up price so let's go and save that that's awesome sweet sweet sweet sweet and look at this let's think about this are you guys looking at this yes or no guys where do you think this is coming from now are you ready for this let's change this the car item let's change the quantity to what to five boom right there we got the five let's change the title let's say for example i don't wanna let's make one at the title let's say tesla model why oh let's go oh i love that car it's such a good car oh let's go oh yes boom one la let's go [Laughter] i love it all right so look at this you buy tesla's on amazon i'm just thinking oh one day you probably will but no tesla will probably have no nah just go to tesla.com and buy it and i use my referral code just kidding oh yeah i mean actually you could have your referral code which will that's not the goal of this thing all right so guys so we got look we got the tesla model fly we've got the 1449 price tag that's a pretty cheap testament of what i will say that that's pretty cheap fine i know right so okay now here's what we want to do now next up okay let's go ahead and uh change the shopping cart a little bit i want to do a few things now for let's go to cartilage.js for the shopping cart for the title i want a little bit i want to add a little bit of css to add a little bit of padding for the actual mage1 so let's do this one so we'll do we'll do margin bottom margin bottom good guys look how close we are guys we're so close to getting what we exactly want to do so we'll do margin bottom we got a little bit more time left bottom and that's going to be what um margin what do i just do margin this bottom that's going to be what eight pixels okay understood so yeah nice so that puts it a little bit more there awesome now good so we got that portion we got that portion that is sick now here's my question i want to do one small thing now when i click on add to cart i should see it in the cart shouldn't i isn't that correct guys am i right yes or no so how do we make that work what do you guys think what do you think we should do here well let me draw a diagram for you here really quickly guys okay understood so just so you guys understand okay here's what we need to do i'll draw this diagram for you really quickly guys so you guys understand it better all right so we have add to cart here to cart right what we need to do is the following right i'm going to use the following so we got add to cart now what we do after that is after that oh what happened now no damn it add two cards i'm waiting you got it you see it i know that's a card then what we do is we have a rectangular this is going to be a function that's going to actually a add to cart function so i'm going to call this a function okay okay add to cart function what that's going to do is that's going to go ahead and add the card to where what do you think what is going to add to a database so this is the b this is the collection this is going to be the db right here okay add it to the db that's honestly all we gotta do so look at this guys oop all we gotta do is at this point is look i took uh whoop okay add to cart that's going to be the function that's going to be called okay that's going to get the data of the current item and then that's going to add to a database right here that it is going to add to is going to be the card items database that's pretty much it and then that way because that way when we go on when we go ahead and go to the cart page let me go the card page there's gonna be the card page right all we gotta do is we gotta pull down that data understood boom gonna pull down ah it's all good it's all good that's it how cool is that very cool i like it cool as that guy said guys please don't spam i'd appreciate that so look at the card add to card card items card that is a pretty good drawer i want you guys to take a picture of that okay i want you guys to save that take a picture when i want i want to know who took a picture then who actually will post it on discord and so forth okay so that we can understand it all right let me see this tells me that you are participating as much as possible awesome sweet so again beautiful so the first thing i want to do is let's actually create that that what that the the add item and that's going to happen where that's going to happen very simple what's up oh yeah yes exactly so if we go to pro that gs there we go beautiful so let's do this right now let's go to prodigy yes product dot gs awesome now right there you see he's already starting on the add to cart function so we're going to create the article for sorry [Laughter] oh great oh good all right it's up again add to cart function amazing beautiful and then this add to cart function we're going to go ahead and save the data in the database right so here's what we'll do we'll do the following we'll do well actually the first thing we need to do is we need to grab the data that's going to come from the actual database so here's we'll do we'll go to cart item is equal to db.collection no hold on let me type let me type okay you type it then give me the collection right look at this add to cart you can do the collection card items card items items dot doc doc id so what is this going to do this is going to create a new document with the id from where from the product you see that guys from the product now what we can do in this case and we'll do a card item dot what dot get to get the actual right so to get the actual uh what's it called now of course we need to import db so do import yeah from what from firebase files all right and then what's going to happen is that after we do this the following the phone is going to happen so the first thing to do is here's the thing we're doing this for a reason okay we're going to grab the current items from the from the database to check if there's already one because here's the thing if this already exists in the cart what shall we do all we need to do is simply update the quantity of it correct not we should not add it we should update the quantity correct so here's what we'll do we'll do we'll get this we'll do dot then okay that then should not do this dot then okay and then inside here let's take a look at this inside here we'll get the document now here's what we can do we're going to say this if the document exists doc.exist meaning it is there it's something that we get from a firebase so that doesn't exist value and that's what we get from firebase right so docked exists we'll default we'll do card item tell what so that update the update right there and what we're going to update with it update it with well pretty much the same thing and the only thing we're going to update however is just the quantity quan t t and that's going to be what we'll do what doc dot data we'll get the data we'll do that quantity this is the current quantity what plus one right there so again what's going to happen guys we get the data from the database right here from car items right so this is for if we already have cart in the car so if this for example item is already in the cart we get it here okay if it exists and i i will show to you how we know if it exists if it exists it's very simple all we do is we update the quantity we get the data for this document right there and we get the quantity we update it and we add one that's pretty much it however else if it does not exist then what do we do we can now create it we'll do the collection collection right card items okay now what the doc will create a new id dot set right there this is how you save new data in the database we'll do set right there boom this is for if we don't have the data in the database we'll do the builder collection car items we'll create a new id for it and we'll save the data so we'll say name okay let's get what the title from the top come what image is the image correct comma what price is the price come on what quantity what is the quantity what do you think when we start out it's one is one because when we add the first time it's just pretty much one that's all it is right that's it so look at this guys this pretty much completes the add to cart function oh what just happened oops i'm not sure let me go back to home.gs no yes there we go no wait where was it private.js we should be in product.js there you go it goes awesome so then my friends is pretty much it at this point you see this right here car items that get that then dock and so forth so let me go ahead and console the log this for you for your for a second here console.log download dock all right console.log duck okay so uh no dog.exist oh okay no i'll just do doc for now that's fine doc okay now now how do we call this add to car functionality that's a good question now well when you click add to cart yes or no right so let's actually on click of this we can now call this function so look at this guys on the click of this button all we gotta do is do add to cart and then my friends is honestly that's pretty much it one thing i want to do is i want to click add to cart button it's going to make a cursor pointer let's do this so cursor cursor pointer only reason because i want to be a hand thing the hand gesture meaning it's an actual button cursor pointer that's it save that refresh it okay so now look at this we have add to cart understood yes or no right yeah i took card are you guys ready for this yes or no ready ready that's it yeah let's go let's go suspect i want this one okay all right okay let's see what we got okay let's go so i can go ahead and put this into a no i just got that actually what i want is i want to be on the dark side right here so i could go to the console okay that way i can see some data don't worry about this in a second i'll explain i will explain how to fix that okay so here's what we'll do are you ready for this guys are you ready are you ready so oh my god i took out oh look at this okay so something so something has happened look at this we did what the dog dot the console dog right look at this one exists see false there we go and what happened to it is we added it to where the fire base so look at let's take a look at this car items boom now we have two things we got the tesla model y and we have what the macbook pro right there this is all i can say mic drop for me from me guys that's it i'm out peace out sayonara [Laughter] so look look at this this is amazing we've got the actual car items and so now what's going to happen is very simple guys if i now go to what if i now go to what the actual cart i should see it oh let's go we've got the actual thing right here look at this whoo that is amazing so so so so so good now a few things we want to do you see this right here inspect element you can see it's not really the way it should be so look so now we need to fix this height of the shopping cart pretty pretty simple to fix that boom boom let me get going to fix this uh height so i will go ahead and go to the card items boom let's remove the height of 300 pixels hey there we go beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful look at this guys we've got the shopping cart now a few things you see how this is here and this is here how do we solve this the reason why this is here is why because of course this tesla model y is a short text and this is a lot and so it's and this is a lot longer so it's pushing this to the side now but how do we solve that and we can solve them very easily okay guys very easily very easily so at this point we're almost there okay how do we solve that very very very simple are you ready for this bro ready i'm sorry yeah yeah yeah yeah so in order for us in order for us to fix this guys in order for us to fix this right right here's what we'll do we need to make this one flags grow so we need to make this dip as it grow as much as possible so for the title let's go the car item car island.js okay let's go the title which is which one this card item info top correct no actually let's go to cart item info i want to go the whole thing this card item info card item info let's go all with the bottom boom chisel do i'll do look at this guys for this one i'll do flex grow row one ready for this bro oh on the bead drop look at that look at that so this basically what happened here is very simple guys it's very simple this oh that's really weird what the heck is this so right there this basically was here in this when i said flex grow one it was like you know what i'm gonna go as much as i possibly can pushing everything else to the side it's as simple as simple as simple as that understood yes or no awesome one last thing i want us to do one last thing for today guys we're almost done at this point is i want to uh fix this uh this what's it called this um five i want to make this into an actual select button so let's do that right now you ready for this bro so help me on this one i we need to go ahead and create the select option so let's do this if i go to select what is it all right now instead of having car in that quantity we'll need to change this up guys this is very serious matter understood guys let's do this for this one this needs to be a select button because what is our goal we need to be able to do this right boom select as many quantities we possibly want okay right so i mean there's a limit of course but here's that this is the goal right here right very simple so let's make this work holy look at this this is crazy so i'm the quantity right here's what we'll do let's go ahead and create a select select a button so do select this works just as an html select so you can see right away we have select is not does nothing here but we'll add something here so here's what we are going to do we're going to create an options uh what's it called like kind of like let's think about an options list look at this guys oh look at this so we'll say let options options is equal to an empty array okay empty array and what's going to happen is very simple all we will do is the following we'll create a loop okay it will create a loop and what he's doing here now is we're doing four let i equals one this is a loop guys we're going to start from one and then we're going to continue until what until the max of whatever the number is or or max of 20. so basically we're saying that the max amount of items you can possibly buy is 20 or the current quantity you selected all right so look at this so here while i is less than math.max car either quantity max of the current quantity actually it's not called item it's actually going to be item hold on stop it stop here a second i have that quantity right there good plus one good i plus plus good what we're going to do is options.push and we're going to push in an option value value what value good good good good quantity is going to be i so again it's gonna start from one so one two three and so forth because here's why guys let me show this to you okay let me save this here for a second okay here's why in order for me to do option i do here i do option option good and i do what i do let's say this is a value value is equal to let's say one that's going to be q t y one so right save this boom see you have quantity one that's it we have a select option all we're doing now at this point is converting this into being dynamic okay so it changes so here's what we're doing look at this guys options.push we we have a list of options options.push and basically let's say for example there's uh let's say there's uh let's say let's say this let's say this there's five quantities what we're going to do is we're going to select 20 here so while i is less than 20 we give them the ability to select 20 as a quantity okay and so we're going to create 20 quantities here uh qty i not one by the way bro i oh i wrote one yeah okay that's fine sorry right there awesome okay and then that's pretty much it so now instead of doing here i do options so let's go and save this and look at this wait boom right there we got 20 options right there right but now of course this has five this is one what do we do in that case well what we do no no not that change forget about this for now oh okay what we're going to do is we're going to give the value so look at this i say value is equal to what is equal to item quantity save it boom so look what happened this now quantity right there became one you see and it's selected automatically as five and this one is one because that's our quantity right there understood guys that's pretty much it right that's pretty pretty pretty pretty much it guys that's what literally happened here now let's go and remove this on the coin we don't need this right now okay let's modify this to look a lot better okay so let's go and save this good so we have this select option all we gotta do is simply just modify in terms of how it looks and that's pretty pretty much it and i'll show you exactly how we can do that oh cancel here i want that let's go to our car item quantity container okay let's go down to here car item coin the container where is it right there okay good and what we'll do is we'll do a select select down here okay good select and then select here's what we'll do we'll do number one we're going to do border radius of 7 pixels radius of 7 pixels we're almost done guess that guys so this is pretty cool 7 pixels we'll do background color background color color what oh let's make it like uh let's make this color right here you guys copy this for yourselves okay right there that's the background color okay and then we'll do the following is we'll do give it a padding to make it a little bit bigger padding of 8 pixels oh look at that starting to look a lot better now yeah exactly beautiful beautiful beautiful and then so that's awesome and then what's going to happen is the following right so we got that portion now what i want to do is we'll do a small back shadow to give it a little bit of a box shadow so this will do i'll get got this box right here i'm going to paste it here and boom so this is h horizontal so how does backstage work it's very simple horizontal shift vertical shift and this is the amount of blur you want to apply that's the color that's pretty much it guys okay save that oh let's go and then one thing i want to remove is this thinking purple thing that's on the focus i think right so yeah select select focus focus and i'm going to do the following okay you could put the focus inside of select that's true i will show that to you guys in a second outline none oh let's go that's awesome look at that beautiful right now what he's trying to do is he's gonna show the way this way so he's gonna do remove this focus and he's actually going to put this inside select right here you see and make that right there you can actually do that guys you can nest css basically here and that's only with with style components you can do the end with sas right i can nest things here right select and the focus of select i can do whatever i want here understood so now boom boom that's all i want and guys at this point that is pretty much it one thing i want to do is you see how it's not centered i want to do align item center on the what's on the info bottom so as we'll do display effects we'll do align item center to center them vertically boom you see now they're vertically centered that looks much much much better and that's pretty much it look and the one other thing i want to do is i want to add what i want to add a small line here understood guys yes or no let's do that right now so we'll do we'll go to the container of the car item our item and we'll do a border bottom on pixel solid only like this boom one pixel split right boom and boom that is it we have ourselves guys that is it look at this guys all we do now is go back to amazon let's go ahead and do this let's go ahead and add uh this right here add to cart awesome let's go back to cart oh look at this quantity of one let's remove this tesla model why because we don't need this right now so let's go ahead and go back to our firebase remove tesla model y here for a second so we'll remove this delete document good awesome let's now go back to our thing hey let's go it looks so good guys and check this out now if i go back to here if i click add to cart here again what do i do what's gonna happen very simple now what's gonna happen let me see uh oh at the cart oh look at that you see something's wrong here so let me let me turn it one more time let me go here that's a card here it's adding multiple so it's not the dock that exists is not doing its its right job so we need to fix that right now let's fix that you see because for some reason let me see so let's think about this let's go back to uh items product product where uh product gs yes awesome so look at this for some reason let's see think about this so doc.id.get and it's not giving the doc so it says um if doc dot exists it should technically update the quantity but for some reason let's think about this so how do we debug this guys what do you guys think the reason why is because again the problem here is it's creating duplicates instead it needs to change the quantity understood yes good so let's think of this let's see number one is the car items what is the id it's giving me so let's do console.log console.log let's do this it's all id so let's think about this because you tell me what do you guys think huh tell me console.log id so now if i go back to here i click inspect them then this one console.log if i click uh refresh this i'm gonna put this on the bottom side okay click add to cart undefined uhhuh okay so what was going on here is we're not passing the id correctly you see right see guys that is good this is right here is really good way to what's it called to debug right so i realized that the id might be the issue here because the id is like if it's not finding the document potential it's because of the id is not correct so where are we passing the id and let's think about this now let's go and save this let's go back to the where we pass an idea and inside the hope that you uh home.js is correct i'm not hearing what you're saying here oh uh so i said oh look at that so before i remove this for a second here look we didn't have this guys you see that's the issue we did not have this so now all we gotta do is do id and go ahead do david okay so we want to pass in the id good that's going to be data.9 data data id good and save that beautiful boom let's do it one more time let's go ahead and remove some of this stuff we don't need this like for example i do not need this i don't need like this stuff delete document from here let's see let's let's remove duplicates okay okay document let's just empty out the whole thing i'll empty it out let's do the document good let's empty it out that's fine boop boop all right this one here god awesome items is clean right now are you guys ready for this you guys ready for this let's go add to cart let's go add to cart boom we got that awesome let's get clicking one time add to cart oh not the quantity is two which is plus one more time boom oh that's so good quantity is three now at the card for this one hey let's go guys that is pretty much it guys look at this we pretty much finished exactly what we want to do which is amazing so it makes me really really happy so look we got the front page this is connected directly to what to what directly connected to what to the actual database okay all right uh we got the card page that's also connected to what to the database right here now and that's pretty much it that was the goal of today is to be able to create something like this together right database together with the card and we'll do it for the next today for tomorrow we've got something special we're going to create the login page and for tomorrow we're also going to finish up do a lot of the touches actually do this make the car total work and so forth that's going to be for tomorrow understood and the login page as well so a lot of fun things going on tomorrow that's pretty much it guys so who had fun if you have any questions let's go drop this out below but so far it has been amazing and if you guys want to go ahead and actually download this project as we're working on
