00:18 - gonna create just a few files and I'll
00:20 - show you how first we're gonna open up
00:22 - our Visual Studio code once our Visual
00:24 - Studio code is open let's hit command +
00:27 - or ctrl + + or sorry let's hit command o
00:33 - and we will open our JavaScript crash
00:35 - course folder once this folder is opened
00:39 - we will go inside of this folder and hit
00:41 - this plus sign over here to create a new
00:44 - file now this new file we will just call
00:47 - it index.html like so all right I'm
00:51 - gonna hit command B you can probably hit
00:53 - control B if you're on Windows and you
00:55 - can hide this I'll show you how to run
00:57 - JavaScript in your browser we won't be
01:01 - dealing with node or any of that
01:02 - complexity we will try to keep it pretty
01:04 - damn simple so we're gonna run HTML from
01:09 - our or we're gonna run JavaScript from
01:11 - our our index.html file here's a
01:16 - shortcut just do dock hit tab and hit
01:20 - save so it's gonna write the bare bone
01:23 - HTML code you need to kind of get
01:25 - started and where our JavaScript code we
01:30 - will put it for now is we will put it
01:32 - right over here and and test it out now
01:37 - in between these script tags is where
01:40 - you will write JavaScript code in the
01:42 - future I'll show you how you create a
01:43 - JavaScript file and then write your code
01:45 - there I'm gonna say console dot log
01:49 - hello and now we're going to open up a
01:54 - chrome tab like so I'm gonna hit command
02:00 - o or you can hit control o go to

02:16 - see is that it says hello now I'm gonna
02:19 - hit save and refresh you should see that
02:21 - hello again if I copy this code and I
02:24 - paste it here and I come here and
02:26 - refresh and I said you should see two
02:27 - hellos if I write alert and I say yo
02:33 - come on right here and refresh you see
