00:00 - that was fantastic brother so what I
00:03 - will say is the first thing you got to
00:06 - do is make sure your coding skills are
00:08 - you know the first thing I would focus
00:11 - on for you is making sure I get my CODIS
00:12 - feels really tight and that doesn't
00:15 - necessarily mean you have to spend like
00:17 - three years or two years becoming a
00:19 - professional software developer it just
00:21 - means that you like one month deep dive
00:25 - into coding you can really condense your
00:28 - time so if you just go deep dive as much
00:31 - as you can I'm talking like four hours
00:34 - or more a day right if even more like
00:38 - when I was doing it I was doing fifteen
00:40 - hours a day just because it's so fun and
00:41 - I just I just deep dive that's how I do
00:43 - anything so but it'll condense your time
00:48 - you know whereas everybody's spending
00:49 - five years picking up that skill bro
00:51 - like it'll take you one to two months to
00:53 - get pretty decent at it so I have my
01:01 - free I have free courses on YouTube you
01:03 - can like look up my thing and look up my
01:06 - name and start with them you'll get a
01:07 - lot of value out of it but just like
01:09 - really deep dive and consume everything
01:12 - from it spent [ __ ] yet you spend three
01:22 - to four months if you've been better
01:24 - yeah spent three to four months like
01:26 - going in hard for sure I mean you have
01:37 - the right mentality dude because most
01:39 - people are trying to play this really
01:41 - short-term game they're like I'll code
01:43 - for a week and then I'll start making
01:44 - money and it's like [ __ ] no that that's
01:45 - not how it works
01:46 - but but if you invest a lot of time and
01:50 - a lot of hard work and you just are
01:52 - consistently putting an effort for three
01:54 - to four months you're gonna be in a
01:56 - great place
01:57 - at that point I would start looking into
02:00 - oh it's for you I would start looking
02:03 - into coaching other people in coding
02:08 - yep yep like teaching other people
02:10 - basically so there are online platforms
02:14 - like wise ant and take lessons and code
02:17 - mentor where you can be charging
02:19 - anywhere from $25 an hour to like $50 an
02:22 - hour or more real talk if you really put
02:38 - effort in one and a half months of
02:40 - serious effort you can start teaching
02:43 - yep no I mean think about this I started
02:55 - really coding in 2016 now I have a
03:00 - business in 2019 for me the return
03:19 - almost [ __ ] instantly I like to stay
03:21 - really close to the revenue because you
03:24 - might like I know for a fact like you
03:26 - know people's dreams die when they can't
03:31 - figure out how to generate an income
03:32 - from that thing yeah yeah man I'm gonna
03:58 - guide you through the process like you
04:00 - can you you just have access to like my
04:02 - direct phone line so you can message me
04:04 - and I'll help you and guide you through
04:06 - the process but bro I promise you if you
04:08 - actually in like really [ __ ] hunker
04:11 - down and invest
04:12 - into this this is very very possible and
04:15 - for you like think about who is paying
04:18 - people to learn how to code their
04:20 - complete beginners bro sure you actually
04:24 - have more advantage being a beginner
04:25 - yourself teaching other beginners then
04:28 - if you were a professional yes that's
04:33 - absolutely right that's correct so so
04:37 - you can really scale that thing up as
04:39 - much as you want like I went from being
04:41 - able to make $500 a month from teaching
04:45 - others all the way to five thousand to
04:48 - nine thousand dollars a month from
04:50 - teaching others so so you can really
04:54 - scale it but the reason why I like it is
04:56 - because you can be an earning an income
04:58 - while you're coding you can be you're
05:01 - earning an income by teaching others
05:02 - you're actually learning even better for
05:04 - yourself okay so you're massively
05:07 - improving your skill and you don't need
05:09 - to wait three years to become a
05:11 - professional software developer before
05:12 - you start looking for your job
05:14 - that's how people's dreams die that's
05:16 - how you have people who go to college
05:18 - for four years then this bender you're
05:21 - looking for a job and then they just
05:22 - like start working at [ __ ] noodles
05:24 - and company yeah man I I like to call it
05:42 - la earn which is you know I started it
05:45 - jokingly with my friends but I think
05:46 - it's a very real thing it's like you
05:48 - earn while you're learning yeah because
05:55 - then you can invest more time in
05:57 - decoding too as you're able to earn an
05:59 - income this way you don't have to like
06:01 - do a over on the side while you're
06:03 - learning how to code well you know what
06:05 - I mean you can actually yeah that's what
06:09 - happens to a lot of people and that
06:11 - slows down their time right now the more
06:14 - income you can earn from coding the more
06:16 - time to get spending decoding and
06:18 - because
06:18 - that you'll not only be increasing your
06:21 - income but at the same time really
06:23 - quickly increasing your skill set yeah
06:30 - so hunker down build the skills and then
06:34 - few months from now I want you to like
