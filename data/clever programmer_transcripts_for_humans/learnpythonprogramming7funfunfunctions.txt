00:00 - - Okay so this part
now, naturally leads us
00:04 - to fun fun functions, alright.
00:07 - So let's talk about that.
00:09 - Alright, so what we have done
so far has been really cool.
00:16 - We figured out how to draw a square
00:19 - and we figured out how to
write it as a Python script,
00:22 - so when we run it, it
all runs at the same time
00:25 - instead of running it here one by one.
00:27 - We also learned about
variables and strings
00:30 - so in here the thing that's
a variable is my_turtle,
00:35 - and then we keep using that
variable over and over again.
00:40 - Let me ask you a simple question.
00:41 - In this program right here,
00:42 - is there a single string
that we're using any where?
00:47 - Yes or no, what do you
think, three, two, one...
00:50 - Hmm... there isn't any
strings that we're using here.
00:53 - What we are using here are integers,
00:57 - and integers are just whole numbers
01:00 - from negative infinity
to positive infinity.
01:03 - So you have negative,
you could have 100, 90,
01:06 - but if you have 90.2,
that's not an integer,
01:12 - that's something else,
which we will discuss.
01:15 - But up to this point,
I think that we are...
01:21 - This naturally leads us to functions,
01:24 - so let's talk about that.
01:26 - Notice that when this part of
the code runs, what it does.
01:32 - This part of the code I want you
01:33 - to just kind of memorize it for now,
01:35 - you're not gonna really
understand what it means
01:37 - until we get to
object-oriented programming.
01:40 - But I want you to just focus on this part,
01:43 - and what does this part do?
01:45 - So let me just simply run the code
01:46 - and let's see what that
part does once we run it.
01:51 - And it goes and it draws a square.
01:55 - So this part of the code draws the square.
02:03 - Okay, that's cool, what
if we wanted to make...
02:09 - Whenever we want to make
a square it seems like
02:14 - we would have to copy this
code and write it again.
02:16 - So for example, let's say
my_turtle.forward(100)
02:24 - and let's see what happens.
02:26 - I'm gonna save it and I'm gonna run it.
02:31 - Okay so I'm gonna move it forward.
02:34 - And now I'm gonna try
to draw another square,
02:38 - so I'm just gonna copy paste that code.
02:46 - Oh cool, it kind of looks
like glasses or something.
02:49 - So let's go back.
02:52 - So this is a square
02:56 - and this part is a square.
03:01 - So every time you have to draw a square
03:03 - you have to copy this whole bunch of code
03:06 - and write it again and again every time.
03:10 - Well think about this, back
when we were using variables,
03:15 - did we have to remember
all of these numbers?
03:19 - No, we just stored it in X.
03:21 - So I'm gonna teach you guys a trick
03:23 - where you can take this
entire block of code
03:26 - and kind of give it a name.
03:28 - Like a variable name, almost.
03:30 - But it's a little bit different
03:31 - and when you assign
something to a block of code,
03:34 - it's called, you put it in a function.
03:38 - Okay so here, it's all gonna make sense.
03:44 - So I'm gonna remove this up at the top.
03:48 - Oh, quick thing, just in case you guys
03:50 - don't know what this is.
03:51 - This is called a comment.
03:53 - Anything that you write with
a hashtag in front of it,
03:56 - you're telling Python to ignore that part.
04:00 - I don't want you guys
to get confused by that.
04:03 - So for example if I write #HI
here, it'll just ignore it.
04:07 - But if I write HI here, it'll
give me an error or something.
04:11 - So hashtag means I'm putting a comment
04:13 - and it's only for humans to read.
04:16 - So now let's turn it into a function.
04:18 - So I'm gonna say D-E-F, that means define.
04:22 - And we're gonna define some function.
04:23 - So what does this thing do?
04:26 - It draws a square, right?
04:28 - So I think it would maybe make sense
04:30 - if we called this function a square.
04:33 - And whenever you create a function
04:35 - you have to put open close
parentheses after it,
04:38 - just like that.
04:40 - And put a colon, okay?
04:42 - And now everything that you want
04:44 - to make part of that function,
you have to indent it.
04:50 - So what I'm gonna do is go here, hit tab,
04:52 - go here hit tab, go here hit tab,
04:56 - and then you can also just highlight
04:58 - that part of the code
that you want to move
05:00 - and just hit tab all at
once, it'll move it for you.
05:04 - Now let's see what happens
when we run this code.
05:11 - So I'm using the shortcut to run the code.
05:15 - Hm, that's weird, it's not
really moving anywhere.
05:19 - Think to yourself, why is that happening.
05:22 - Okay, let me tell you this.
05:24 - If I wanted Bob, or let's
say X, to be this number.
05:33 - And I wanted to make X
spit out that number,
05:37 - print that number out to the screen.
05:39 - Well if I define X to be something,
05:42 - that's not the part that
does the spitting out.
05:44 - That's just me defining what X is.
05:47 - But the part that does the spitting out
05:49 - is when I actually say X and hit enter
05:51 - and it does something.
05:52 - So if I do banana is yellow,
05:58 - then if I want to say the yellow part,
06:01 - I would actually have to say banana,
06:03 - then it spits out yellow.
06:06 - Just like that, me defining a function
06:09 - doesn't call the function,
06:11 - doesn't actually use the function.
06:14 - So I actually have to call the function
06:15 - or use the function to
make it do something
06:18 - and make it spit it out, pretty much.
06:22 - So here I'm gonna say square.
06:27 - So if you were born and someone
gave you the name Jimmy,
06:31 - that's them giving you a name.
06:33 - They're not calling you Jimmy,
06:34 - they're not telling you
to come over, Jimmy,
06:36 - they're just giving you a name,
06:38 - attaching that label onto you.
06:40 - Then later when they want to
call you, they go hey Jimmy.
06:43 - And you're like what's up.
06:46 - They're like Jimmy, come here.
06:47 - And then you respond to them.
06:49 - So just like that, we give
this function a name: square.
06:54 - And here we're calling it.
06:56 - So now let's see what happens.
06:59 - So I'm going to run this.
07:07 - Look at that.
07:08 - It made a square.
07:09 - Well what does that mean?
07:11 - What if we want it to do that same thing,
07:13 - where we moved forward 100
07:15 - and we wanted to make another square.
07:17 - So let's say I put this
line move forward 100.
07:22 - And then I want to make another square,
07:25 - how would I make another square?
07:27 - Should I copy all this code
and then paste it right here?
07:33 - No, the trick is that I just
call that function again,
07:37 - that makes a square.
07:39 - So let me run it.
07:47 - Okay, how cool is that?
07:49 - So why do we create functions?
07:51 - Hopefully it's clear to you.
07:53 - We create a function so we can just
07:56 - reuse that code over and over again
07:58 - without having to write
all of that stuff again
08:02 - and again and again.
08:05 - To make it a little bit cooler,
another thing I'll show you
08:09 - about functions in the next video
08:11 - is how we can give arguments
to functions, or parameters.
08:16 - So until then, I'll see
you in the next video.

Okay so this part now, naturally leads us to fun fun functions, alright. So let's talk about that. Alright, so what we have done so far has been really cool. We figured out how to draw a square and we figured out how to write it as a Python script, so when we run it, it all runs at the same time instead of running it here one by one.

So you have negative, you could have 100, 90, but if you have 90.2, that's not an integer, that's something else, which we will discuss. But up to this point, I think that we are... This naturally leads us to functions, so let's talk about that. Notice that when this part of the code runs, what it does.

But I want you to just focus on this part, and what does this part do? So let me just simply run the code and let's see what that part does once we run it. And it goes and it draws a square. So this part of the code draws the square. Okay, that's cool, what if we wanted to make... Whenever we want to make a square it seems like we would have to copy this code and write it again. So for example, let's say my_turtle.forward(100) and let's see what happens. I'm gonna save it and I'm gonna run it. Okay so I'm gonna move it forward. And now I'm gonna try to draw another square, so I'm just gonna copy paste that code. Oh cool, it kind of looks like glasses or something. So let's go back. So this is a square and this part is a square. So every time you have to draw a square you have to copy this whole bunch of code and write it again and again every time. Well think about this, back when we were using variables, did we have to remember all of these numbers? No, we just stored it in X.

So for example if I write #HI here, it'll just ignore it. But if I write HI here, it'll give me an error or something. So hashtag means I'm putting a comment and it's only for humans to read.

What if we want it to do that same thing, where we moved forward 100 and we wanted to make another square. So let's say I put this line move forward 100.
