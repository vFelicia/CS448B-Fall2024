00:00 - hey guys what's up this is kazy from
00:03 - clever
00:05 - program.com welcome back to SQL part
00:08 - three so we're going to jump through and
00:11 - run through this bad boy so this is
00:14 - queries with constraints part two as
00:16 - titled up
00:18 - there is essentially the wear stuff but
00:21 - more
00:22 - advanced so let's go through it okay um
00:26 - all right so up until now hopefully
00:28 - you've watched part one
00:31 - which is important why this stuff
00:34 - matters um and once you wrap your mind
00:36 - around why this stuff matters then the
00:38 - learning kind of just comes from that
00:40 - and the enjoyment and learning comes
00:42 - from that as well all
00:45 - right find all the Toy Story movies okay
00:48 - so that's probably not going to be that
00:50 - hard I want to find everything about any
00:54 - movie that's Toy Story so I can try to
00:58 - filter it by John last
01:01 - but Bug's Life also has John's laer I
01:04 - can try to filter filter it by year but
01:06 - years are different could try to filter
01:09 - by length length is
01:11 - different
01:14 - or so well you guys think about it think
01:17 - about it before I say any solution how
01:20 - would I filter it how would I filter it
01:22 - so it finds a common pattern between
01:24 - this and the common pattern between
01:27 - this without being extremely specific
01:29 - spefic and saying something like Select
01:32 - Title from movies where title equal
01:38 - equal Toy Story and title equal equal
01:42 - Toy Story too so without
01:45 - being painfully
01:47 - verbose let's keep it really really
01:50 - simple okay and let's try to find a
01:52 - pattern here that will allow us to
01:54 - capture all of
01:56 - that all right so let's jump in and see
02:01 - okay so a lot of the times what you have
02:03 - to use for that is something called wild
02:05 - cards okay which is probably what
02:07 - they're going to talk about here I don't
02:09 - know if they use a specific word wild
02:11 - card but that's really what it is let's
02:13 - see if they use wild yep they actually
02:15 - do wild card card pattern matching
02:19 - so okay so the one that we're probably
02:22 - looking for is something like an
02:23 - asterisk which they're not showing here
02:28 - I think I can say like
02:30 - okay so I can use this word like all
02:32 - right check it out this is going to be
02:33 - really
02:35 - cool what do I have to select I have to
02:37 - select only the title since we have to
02:39 - find all the Toy Story titles we are
02:42 - going to do select star for now from
02:46 - movies where title like and here they do
02:51 - wild card matching so if you do the
02:53 - percent sign and you put anything in
02:55 - between it it'll just look for that so
02:57 - for example at is called inside
02:59 - sensitive case uh matching so here at or
03:04 - attic or bats or cat anything has at in
03:07 - it either at the end or at the beginning
03:10 - or in the middle okay so we
03:14 - title
03:16 - like um percent
03:21 - toy um story because we're looking for
03:25 - Toy Story 1 Toy Story 2 Toy Story 3 so
03:28 - we're going to say just look for this
03:31 - and then that's
03:32 - it so it almost reads like English
03:36 - select everything from movies where the
03:38 - title is like Toy Story it's
03:41 - like right um but generally how you'll
03:46 - write it is just break it down on
03:48 - separate lines so it's easy to kind of
03:50 - Reason through it and read through it
03:52 - okay let's reset let's try the second
03:54 - one you try it and then I'm going to do
03:56 - it as well so then you follow along and
03:58 - look at my solution okay no cheat in you
04:00 - don't deserve to cheat unless you know
04:02 - how to do it so pause please then
04:05 - actively learn and then you can come and
04:07 - see the solutions it's a good idea to
04:09 - learn like that find all the movies
04:12 - directed by John
04:14 - Lassiter so how are we going to do that
04:16 - think about it okay
04:19 - pause if you got it uh okay good I'm
04:23 - going to go through it I'm just going to
04:25 - kind of speak it and then I'm going to
04:27 - like format it so okay select all the
04:31 - movies so I'm going to say select all
04:33 - the movies from movies where
04:39 - director and I can say like and I'm
04:42 - going to say John
04:45 - Lasseter okay so it selected all the
04:48 - movies where that's the director perfect
04:50 - let's reset again find all the movies in
04:53 - director not directed by John Lasser
04:56 - okay so select here's the hack I'm GNA
04:58 - do for this one
05:01 - from movies where
05:05 - director
05:07 - like John
05:11 - Lassiter okay and check out the
05:13 - hack and just negate the whole thing and
05:16 - then it gives you the opposite that's it
05:18 - boom done all right find all the Wall E
05:21 - movies so for example you might have
05:23 - Wall G or Wall E or yeah that's it so I
05:29 - think I can do it the same
05:31 - way um I can say select everything from
05:35 - you know and then go down select
05:37 - everything from movies where movie like
05:41 - or we're sorry title like
05:45 - wall let's do percent like that okay um
05:50 - and I don't need the percent behind that
05:52 - I can just say wall and then whatever
05:54 - matches whatever random stuff afterwards
05:57 - is fine I can also do this and then do
06:00 - the percent sign here okay all of those
06:04 - work okay guys we are done with exercise
06:08 - three great job so far keep trying to do
06:11 - it on your own and then also then check
06:14 - in with the video because I'll cover a
06:16 - lot of the peripheral stuff that goes
06:18 - around it for example I'll do some right
06:20 - now um here you have like if not like
06:24 - you have uh in and not in so for example
06:28 - how I would use in here is I can say we
06:31 - title
06:33 - in
06:35 - Wall
06:36 - E comma wall
06:40 - G that also works okay so that's an
06:44 - example okay guys thank you for watching
06:47 - awesome I'll see you in part four I
06:49 - think that's what it should be and we're
06:51 - going to cover more stuff so this is it
06:54 - for this video and I'll see you in the
06:57 - next video

hey guys what's up this is kazy from clever program.com welcome back to SQL part three so we're going to jump through and run through this bad boy so this is queries with constraints part two as titled up there is essentially the wear stuff but more advanced so let's go through it okay um all right so up until now hopefully you've watched part one which is important why this stuff matters um and once you wrap your mind around why this stuff matters then the learning kind of just comes from that and the enjoyment and learning comes from that as well all right find all the Toy Story movies okay so that's probably not going to be that hard I want to find everything about any movie that's Toy Story so I can try to filter it by John last but Bug's Life also has John's laer I can try to
