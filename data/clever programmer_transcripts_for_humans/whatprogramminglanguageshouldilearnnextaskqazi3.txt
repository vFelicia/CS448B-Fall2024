00:00 - - Hey you, what's up?
00:02 - This is Qazi from cleverprogrammer.com
00:04 - and in this video we're
going to talk about
00:06 - when should you move on to learning
00:08 - your second programming language.
00:11 - So that, any of that other bullshit,
00:12 - let's jump right into it.
00:14 - (upbeat music)
00:25 - So this question is actually inspired
00:28 - by The Prime on my YouTube channel,
00:31 - and essentially he wants to know
00:33 - how does one test himself or herself
00:37 - if he or she has become
an expert in Python.
00:40 - So, meaning, when do I
move on to another language
00:44 - and when do I know I've
become an expert in Python?
00:48 - Here's how I would answer that question.
00:51 - This question, it kind of frustrates me,
00:54 - and I'm going to tell you why.
00:55 - It's almost like saying,
"Hey, once I learn English
00:59 - "and I become an expert in English,
01:01 - "which language should I learn next?"
01:04 - Well, if you came to America
and you learned English
01:07 - to get here, maybe your next step is
01:09 - to look for a job using English.
01:11 - Maybe it wouldn't make sense for you
01:12 - to just randomly learn
different languages.
01:15 - Right?
01:16 - Or if you went to China
and learned Chinese,
01:17 - it doesn't really make
sense for you to learn
01:20 - more languages like after you
got done learning Chinese.
01:22 - Like use your, put your Chinese to use.
01:26 - So in this case, once you learn Python,
01:28 - put your Python to use.
01:30 - Build projects, build apps, that should be
01:32 - your next goal.
01:33 - Building real things using Python.
01:35 - The only time you learn newer languages is
01:39 - when you need to.
01:40 - For example, if you can't do...
01:42 - Like for example, you can't do front-end
01:43 - web development with
Python so that's the time
01:45 - you do need to learn about JavaScript,
01:47 - but I would say first learn about Python
01:50 - and then when you need to, go and learn
01:51 - about JavaScript.
01:53 - And if you're putting together a website,
01:54 - don't learn HTML until
you start putting together
01:57 - the website, then yes
go ahead and learn HTML.
02:01 - Almost like if you were
conducting business
02:03 - in another country, it
would make a lot of sense
02:06 - for you to then start learning
that language at that time
02:09 - because that's going to be
the most valuable for you,
02:11 - that's going to be the biggest return
02:13 - on your investment.
02:15 - How does one know that they
became an expert in Python?
02:19 - You don't.
02:20 - It's like you spend your
whole life doing it.
02:22 - You can call yourself an expert.
02:24 - It's just like how do you
become an expert in English.
02:27 - I mean there's no like one set time.
02:29 - It just takes you a lot of time.
02:31 - You build projects with it.
02:33 - You do things with English.
02:35 - You'd be an expert in English.
02:37 - I consider myself maybe
an expert in English,
02:39 - I have 140 different
videos but other people
02:43 - might think otherwise.
02:44 - Maybe people think you need a PhD
02:45 - to become an expert in English.
02:47 - Right?
02:47 - So, maybe people think you need to be
02:49 - the best-selling author to
be an expert in English.
02:52 - There's no real definition here.
02:54 - To become an expert, build things with it,
02:56 - become an authority, like have a portfolio
02:59 - that shows what you've built with Python.
03:01 - You're an expert.
03:02 - You don't need to spend 50 years.
03:04 - If you have multiple apps, multiple things
03:06 - that you've built with Python,
03:08 - you're an expert.
03:10 - Okay, so, I get this question a lot.
03:14 - When should I learn my
second programming language?
03:17 - When did I become an expert?
03:18 - Like, dude, you learn
Python to do stuff with it.
03:23 - The point is not to just learn Python
03:25 - and then just like run away and run, like.
03:27 - That's not the point of programming.
03:28 - The point of programming is not to learn
03:30 - a specific language, it's
essentially understand
03:32 - the programming concepts behind it.
03:35 - That's what you should be
investing your time in.
03:37 - Hopefully, I nailed this
question for you guys.
03:41 - What I want to do since we
started this Ask Qazi segment,
03:45 - I know on YouTube Q and
Q won by a landslide,
03:50 - but on the Twitter
platform and on SnapChat,
03:53 - Ask Qazi dominated.
03:56 - Another reason why I didn't choose to go
03:57 - with Q and Q, I'm sorry
I kind of had to make
03:59 - like a little call here
at the end of the day,
04:02 - I did take your suggestions into account,
04:04 - I had trouble sleeping, trust me.
04:06 - I was like thinking about
what you guys had said,
04:09 - but Ask Qazi is like Ask Gary V,
04:13 - and then there's some other Ask shows too.
04:15 - And it's also great for hash-tagging.
04:17 - How are you going to do Q
and Q with an ampersand?
04:19 - Also what the heck does Q and Q even mean?
04:21 - Questions and Qazi?
04:23 - That doesn't make sense.
04:24 - So I'm sorry, I decided
to go the Ask Qazi route,
04:28 - and usually what I'm going to do is
04:30 - the top voted comment,
I'm going to generally try
04:33 - to answer that in the following videos.
04:36 - So if you have a question,
like a burning question,
04:39 - this is your time to ask it.
04:40 - I will try to go through
multiple questions
04:42 - and if the comments are top voted,
04:44 - I'm going to answer them.
04:45 - But if they're just
goofy and completely dumb
04:47 - and top voted, I don't know,
I might still answer them
04:50 - but you know, I'll just
kind of have to like check
04:53 - and see how they are.
04:54 - Okay guys, that's it.
04:56 - I love your faces off.
04:57 - Thank you guys for watching so much.
04:58 - This was episode three of Ask Qazi
05:02 - and I can't wait to see
you in the next video.
