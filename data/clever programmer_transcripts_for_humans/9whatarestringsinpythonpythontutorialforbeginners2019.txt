00:01 - - Hey, what's up you guys?
00:02 - Aaron here from Clever Programmer,
00:04 - and today I just want to
explain strings a little bit.
00:06 - It's a data type in Python,
00:08 - and yeah, let's get started.
00:10 - (slow electronic music)
00:15 - Alright so strings, what the
heck are strings in Python?
00:20 - Well, I mentioned this in a previous video
00:23 - about data types.
00:25 - All I said was that strings are just
00:28 - things on the screen that are
00:29 - enclosed in quotation marks, okay?
00:32 - So let's just type S for a string.
00:34 - So anything in here, like hello maam okay.
00:39 - Anything enclosed in quotation marks here
00:41 - is considered a string,
00:42 - that's about all I said
in the previous video.
00:45 - But what I actually wanna go through
00:47 - is the distinction between this and the
00:49 - integers and floats and other data types.
00:51 - So a string literally is just whatever
00:57 - is typed on the screen,
it is exactly that okay?
01:00 - Like the string is literally that data.
01:02 - It is that sentence there.
01:05 - A good way to think of a string
01:06 - is just a sentence, it's a
string of any characters,
01:10 - numbers and symbols okay, in a sentence,
01:13 - so you can have anything you want there
01:15 - as long as you want, it can be empty,
01:16 - it can have one character,
01:17 - it can have an entire novel,
an entire ebook in there,
01:20 - it is just considered one string,
01:22 - and it is its own data type
01:24 - because it is considered one whole.
01:26 - It's that entire sentence together
01:28 - is the thing that I'm putting
into this variable S here
01:32 - as you can see.
01:33 - That entire thing is there,
01:34 - and it's just, it is what it is,
01:35 - it's a little bit hard to explain,
01:37 - but it's just exactly that.
01:39 - So you can move this around,
01:41 - you can print S as you can see
01:45 - if I run this then hello maam pops up
01:48 - just like that because this
stuck together as a whole.
01:52 - And yeah pretty much, you
can also index into this.
01:56 - So let's say I want to print S,
02:01 - so those little bracket
here, what this means
02:03 - is I'm going to index into S,
02:05 - so if this is following S
02:07 - and I put a number in here,
02:08 - this is just going to give us
a little part of the string.
02:11 - So this here, we start at zero,
02:13 - we don't start at one in programming,
02:15 - so we start at zero, this
would actually just give us H.
02:18 - If I put in a one, it
would actually give us E.
02:21 - So you're actually able to read
02:22 - different parts of the string.
02:23 - You can actually read different
ranges in the string too,
02:25 - but I'm gonna explain that at a later date
02:27 - and different video, it's called slicing.
02:28 - If you're interested in that,
02:30 - to get something to get a substring,
02:32 - if your substring is just a small part
02:35 - of a longer string, then
you can look that up,
02:38 - but I'll have a video coming out on that
02:40 - going really really in
depth with that later
02:42 - if you just want to wait for that.
02:43 - But yeah, that's pretty much strings.
02:47 - There is a lot of different
function of the strings
02:48 - you can call to.
02:49 - I'll also be going over
those in future videos.
02:57 - But pretty much all you
need to know is that
02:59 - a string is just something
enclosed in quotation marks.
03:01 - You can also use single quotes.
03:02 - I forgot to mention that if
I didn't already say that,
03:04 - just like that, that'll
work equally as well.
03:06 - But yeah, a string is just that,
03:08 - it's just a sentence.
03:09 - A sentence that is together,
and that's the data type.
03:13 - Thank you for watching you guys,
03:14 - I'll see you in the next video.
