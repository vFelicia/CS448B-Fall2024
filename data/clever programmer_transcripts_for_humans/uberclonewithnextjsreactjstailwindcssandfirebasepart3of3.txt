02:58 - great now here's the agenda so this is
03:00 - day four we're going to finish off
03:02 - building the uber clone with next js
03:04 - react.js and tailwind
03:06 - and then tomorrow we're going to be
03:07 - doing your roadmap to becoming a
03:09 - front-end developer in 90 days okay
03:14 - and what time guys are we doing that can
03:16 - you can y'all drop it and chat and let
03:18 - me know what time we're meeting tomorrow
03:20 - okay
03:22 - uh and here's what we're going to be
03:23 - building today by the way so if you guys
03:26 - said 5 p.m pacific good job that's
03:28 - exactly when we're going to be doing
03:29 - this and what's up youtube i'm seeing
03:30 - all of you too and i'm seeing all of
03:32 - your comments
03:33 - all right so we're going to build a
03:35 - login page today because we haven't
03:37 - built that yet you guys have already
03:39 - built the home page you guys have
03:41 - already built the search page and you
03:43 - guys are pretty much done with the
03:45 - confirm ride page
03:47 - but on the confirm ride page we still
03:49 - need to calculate the fares meaning the
03:52 - pricing so where you see that twenty
03:54 - dollars and thirty dollars and twenty
03:56 - two cents we're going to be calculating
03:58 - that and finishing that portion up
04:03 - this side i'm hungry
04:08 - i loved it i'm hungry and i'm tired of
04:10 - this coding thing that's okay that
04:12 - sentiment i feel that very often so
04:14 - thank you for that that's a very very uh
04:17 - common sentiment
04:20 - um awesome so here we go we're gonna get
04:22 - started with first
04:24 - finishing off this page so we're gonna
04:27 - build this fare
04:28 - that's number one what we're gonna do
04:30 - we're gonna build this thing number two
04:33 - we're gonna add this back button so
04:34 - you're able to go
04:36 - back to one of these pages if you hit it
04:39 - and then we're gonna build this login
04:41 - page so there it's just three things
04:43 - we're gonna build is that clear to all
04:45 - of you guys just give me a thumbs up
04:46 - it's clear what we're doing today
04:49 - okay
04:50 - awesome
04:52 - uh cool i didn't see thumbs up from
04:54 - everybody
04:55 - so maybe i confused you guys let me know
04:58 - and if that's the case i can uh
05:01 - explain it again but okay awesome
05:04 - uh thumbs up coming through now
05:05 - beautiful
05:06 - and again stick to day five we got
05:08 - something special coming for you guys so
05:10 - with that said let's get started uh with
05:13 - today's training and we'll give you
05:14 - homework at the end
05:18 - okay so hopefully you guys should be
05:19 - able to see my screen
05:22 - and you guys are able to see uh code
05:24 - here correct
05:27 - okay
05:28 - good
05:29 - awesome david you can see code
05:32 - yes thumbs up okay cool cool cool just
05:34 - making sure we're seeing the right
05:36 - screen here
05:37 - all right beautiful so let's get
05:40 - started
05:41 - um on
05:42 - calculating the fair price so let's go
05:45 - here and let's go santa monica
05:47 - and let's go los angeles and david if
05:49 - you want to play any like lo-fi
05:51 - non-copyrighted music that'd be cool
05:53 - just give a good vibe
05:56 - so
05:57 - here we have
05:59 - uh everything is essentially 24
06:02 - but that's not what we want right we
06:04 - want to be able to calculate an actual
06:06 - fair price that everybody can see
06:09 - so let's go ahead and do that
06:11 - and it needs to be calculated
06:13 - dynamically
06:15 - so in my ride selector what i'm going to
06:17 - do is i need access of a few to a few
06:20 - friends one i need my use effect and i
06:23 - need my use state
06:25 - now
06:26 - why i need my use state is i need to
06:29 - manage the state of something as it
06:31 - changes okay and use effect will allow
06:33 - me to like call my api in an easy way
06:36 - and will make sure my page doesn't crash
06:38 - and just keeps doing it over and over
06:40 - again okay
06:42 - so that's that
06:44 - so let's come over here and i'm just
06:46 - going to say
06:47 - ride
06:48 - duration because we're going to also
06:50 - calculate the right duration
06:53 - and we're going to set the right
06:54 - duration
06:55 - and we're going to be doing a little
06:56 - hack guys to calculate our ride price
06:59 - and essentially we're going to be doing
07:00 - is ride duration is going to tell me hey
07:04 - how many seconds or how many minutes is
07:06 - it going to take me from going from los
07:07 - angeles to santa monica
07:09 - we're going to take that number of
07:11 - seconds
07:12 - and we're just going to multiply that
07:16 - by
07:17 - this like multiplier here right this
07:20 - multiplier is based on whether it's an
07:21 - uber excel
07:23 - uber excel or an uber x
07:26 - okay so for example this uber acts as a
07:28 - multiplier of one so let's just say the
07:31 - distance was 2400 seconds i'm just
07:33 - giving a dummy example if the distance
07:35 - was 2400 seconds
07:37 - then it might just give us 24.
07:39 - okay
07:40 - but for uber excel the multiplier is
07:42 - going to be 1.5
07:45 - which means that
07:46 - 24 dollars multiplied by 1.5 what would
07:50 - that be guys they'll probably be 30
07:52 - something dollars right so
07:55 - that's what we're gonna get
07:57 - okay maybe close to 40 to 40-ish or 35
08:00 - or something like that that's what
08:01 - that's gonna become
08:03 - so hopefully that makes sense on how
08:05 - we're gonna go about and do this but the
08:07 - first thing we need is the right
08:08 - duration okay
08:10 - the next thing we need
08:12 - uh is here's what we're gonna do we're
08:14 - gonna we're gonna call our use effect
08:16 - hook
08:17 - okay
08:19 - and uh let me
08:20 - keep the zoom chat somewhere where i can
08:22 - see it
08:24 - nice i'm getting lots of 36's beautiful
08:30 - my corn dog exploded in the microwave be
08:33 - right back
08:34 - i love uh i love zoom chat
08:38 - oh
08:38 - no all right yeah better take care of it
08:41 - come back fast
08:43 - so what i'm going to do with this use
08:45 - effect hook is the following okay
08:48 - so the first argument is going to be my
08:50 - anonymous function the second argument
08:52 - is my dependencies so we'll put
08:55 - something in the dependency array as
08:56 - well and i'll show you guys what we're
08:57 - going to put in just a second
08:59 - and let's go ahead and call a fetch
09:01 - request
09:02 - and with this fetch request
09:04 - i want to call my mapbox api okay so let
09:09 - me put here what we're going to be doing
09:11 - and why we're doing this okay
09:13 - so
09:15 - get
09:18 - ride duration
09:20 - from mapbox api
09:23 - so what's nice is i don't have to
09:25 - calculate the distance or the right
09:27 - duration mapbox will actually help me do
09:29 - that
09:30 - and in order for it to do that it needs
09:33 - two things okay and here are the two
09:35 - things that it needs
09:37 - it needs a pickup destination
09:41 - all right and then it needs a
09:44 - drop-off destination
09:46 - all right so those are the two things it
09:48 - needs let me write that down
09:50 - pick up coordinates
09:55 - and then it needs
09:56 - drop-off coordinates
09:58 - okay so just keep that in mind as we go
10:01 - along because
10:02 - that's going to be very helpful for us
10:06 - okay
10:07 - so i'm calling fetch fetch allows me to
10:09 - make a request to an api and we're just
10:12 - going to say hey
10:13 - go to mapbox.coms api
10:16 - go to directions we're going to hit
10:18 - version 5 of mapbox
10:20 - driving
10:22 - and then i am going to uh basically now
10:25 - put in my coordinates that's now is when
10:29 - i actually need it
10:31 - okay so i'm going to put a dollar sign
10:34 - here and here's what we need to do you
10:36 - guys see this quote that we have here
10:38 - instead of a single quote like this i'm
10:41 - going to put backticks
10:42 - and backtick is if you're on a mac it's
10:45 - the button to the
10:46 - to the left top left of your one
10:50 - all right i'm going to put a backtick
10:51 - here as well
10:52 - and
10:53 - you guys should write this down this is
10:55 - called template literal
10:58 - this is something that's going to be
10:59 - helpful for you to learn even as a
11:01 - beginner okay just write that down
11:02 - template literal you can learn it at a
11:04 - later point i'll kind of show you
11:07 - uh why we're using it because
11:10 - this whole thing is a string but i want
11:12 - to be able to add in some variables into
11:14 - it so now
11:15 - i'll be able to add them right here
11:19 - cool template literal that's right
11:21 - template literal
11:22 - cool
11:23 - um
11:24 - all right and now i'm going to say pick
11:26 - up coordinates coordinates
11:29 - of 0
11:32 - and then i'm going to say
11:35 - i'm going to get out of here i'm going
11:37 - to put a comma right there put a dollar
11:39 - sign and then do it again
11:41 - and this time i will say pick up
11:43 - coordinates again so i'll just paste it
11:46 - in here except i'll put a one all right
11:49 - so what's happening here quasi why are
11:51 - we having to pick up coordinates well
11:55 - here's why
11:57 - let's go here
11:59 - all right
12:00 - so for this pickup coordinate here guys
12:04 - we need two points
12:06 - one that tells us where it is on the
12:09 - x-axis pretty much and then one that
12:11 - tells us where it is on the y-axis so
12:13 - essentially if i get those two points it
12:16 - gives me this exact pin does that make
12:18 - sense guys
12:19 - why we need two different points okay so
12:22 - we need two points for the um
12:25 - to be very clear let's say this is the
12:27 - pickup so we need two points for the
12:30 - pickup location and then we need two
12:32 - points for the drop-off location
12:35 - yes sam exactly that's right
12:38 - so that's that's why we need that okay
12:41 - so let's go ahead and uncomment this out
12:43 - right now
12:44 - and uh now what we need to do is put a
12:50 - semicolon
12:52 - and then i'm going to take
12:53 - all of this here copy it and i'm going
12:56 - to paste it after the semicolon
12:58 - and instead of pick up coordinates we're
13:01 - going to now change the pick up word
13:04 - to drop off drop
13:06 - off just like that okay
13:09 - here let's do it again
13:11 - drop off
13:12 - so we got two points for drop off two
13:15 - points for pickup
13:18 - okay now you might be wondering hey
13:20 - because where are you getting this
13:21 - variable pickup coordinates from where
13:23 - the heck is this coming from
13:25 - um here's where it's coming from
13:27 - let's go to our confirm.js
13:31 - and let's go down to our ride selector
13:34 - component
13:35 - all right let's go all the way down to
13:36 - our right selector component right here
13:39 - now you see how to the map component
13:42 - you're passing
13:43 - pickup coordinates and drop off
13:45 - coordinates copy that
13:47 - we're going to paste it here
13:48 - and essentially what we're doing is
13:50 - we're passing those
13:52 - coordinates to right selector as well
13:54 - now command click
13:56 - on right selector go back to your write
13:58 - selector component and now right
13:59 - selector will have access to those
14:02 - okay
14:04 - so all we're going to do now to get
14:06 - access to those props is i'm just going
14:08 - to destructure here and we're going to
14:09 - say pick up coordinates
14:12 - and drop off coordinates
14:14 - and that alone right there gets you
14:17 - access to them
14:18 - okay
14:20 - let's go over here
14:22 - oh one more thing that we need to do
14:24 - while we're getting this error let's go
14:26 - back to confirm.js one last time and
14:29 - here's what we're going to do
14:32 - we're defining pickup coordinates here
14:34 - and drop off coordinates here so here in
14:36 - the u state we're just going to make an
14:38 - array and give it a 0 0 just like this
14:41 - this might be north pole or some
14:43 - something crazy like that
14:45 - so we give it zero zero here and we get
14:47 - give it a zero zero here okay
14:50 - let's go back into our ride selector and
14:52 - let's hit refresh
14:56 - okay it says failed to fetch
14:59 - so the reason why it's failing to fetch
15:01 - right now
15:02 - is because i still haven't given it an
15:04 - access token so i gave it all of this
15:07 - but i need to still give it an access
15:09 - token because it's like hey i need that
15:12 - part as well so we're going to put a
15:13 - question mark here and we're going to go
15:15 - access
15:17 - underscore token is equal to
15:21 - and whatever your long token is you're
15:23 - just going to put that here so i'm gonna
15:25 - take my token all right and i'm just
15:28 - gonna paste it right there just like
15:30 - that
15:31 - boom
15:32 - okay
15:34 - so that's all that's happening here i
15:36 - just added an x put a question mark and
15:38 - then i added my access token after it
15:41 - okay
15:42 - and so now that error has stopped it has
15:45 - went away that error is not there
15:47 - anymore
15:51 - uh jealousy says my understanding is
15:53 - next.js is just react with built-in
15:55 - routers and some other things you can
15:57 - think of it like that at a very simple
15:59 - to understand level the other benefits
16:02 - of it are server-side rendering which
16:04 - we're not going to get too much into
16:06 - in this challenge
16:08 - but maybe outside of this challenge on
16:10 - youtube i can show you guys the benefits
16:13 - of
16:13 - server side rendering if you guys want
16:15 - to see them
16:18 - yeah
16:19 - that makes sense it's long yeah it's
16:21 - very long kisly yeah makes sense cool
16:27 - i'm gonna try to keep reading all of
16:28 - your guys's comments too as we go
16:30 - through it and and chat messages so keep
16:32 - dropping them and and i'll keep an eye
16:34 - out for them
16:37 - okay
16:38 - so
16:39 - that's happening now once we receive
16:42 - this fetch request here's what we want
16:44 - to do i'm going to say then i'm going to
16:45 - do something once i receive it and i'm
16:48 - simply going to say
16:51 - you know whatever the response is get me
16:53 - the res.json
16:56 - so get me the json from that response
16:58 - and then i'm going to say dot then
17:02 - okay get the data
17:05 - and simply set the right duration
17:08 - to be data.routes of 0
17:12 - divided by 100. and i'll explain what
17:13 - this means
17:15 - so
17:16 - when we get back the data from the api
17:19 - when we make this request
17:21 - we're look we're giving it all the
17:22 - coordinates right we're giving it
17:25 - we're giving it point a the pickup point
17:28 - we're giving it point b
17:29 - and when we give it those points to the
17:32 - api what it spits back out
17:35 - is a bunch of routes so it goes hey
17:39 - there's like route a
17:42 - right here is route b
17:45 - and each of these routes and they might
17:47 - have route c
17:48 - okay
17:50 - and uh if you looked at them you know
17:52 - how in google it'll tell you like hey
17:54 - here's route one and then here's the
17:56 - other route
17:58 - you know and then here's like some other
18:00 - route what we're saying is
18:03 - just give us this route right here like
18:05 - give us route a i don't care about
18:09 - uh if you have route b
18:11 - and i don't care about route c just give
18:13 - us route a and usually that's the best
18:15 - route and that's why we're saying routes
18:18 - of zero because it might have given us
18:20 - multiple routes does that make sense
18:21 - guys
18:22 - okay i'm getting getting thumbs up
18:25 - okay
18:26 - cool
18:28 - awesome
18:29 - so that's essentially what that data
18:31 - routes of zero is saying now this
18:33 - divided by 100 that's just completely
18:36 - made up okay this is
18:38 - there's no need for that the only reason
18:40 - i have that is so then when we see these
18:42 - numbers they won't look like 24 000
18:45 - they'll look like 24
18:47 - so that's all this is just to like make
18:49 - it a little bit more realistic in our
18:50 - calculations okay it's just completely
18:52 - made up divided by 100 just to make that
18:54 - number small whatever number that this
18:57 - gives us okay because it's going to give
18:58 - us a duration in seconds so we're going
18:59 - to divide it by 100 and then use that as
19:02 - our
19:03 - as our
19:04 - price
19:06 - okay
19:07 - last thing for this use effect hook what
19:09 - we want to do
19:10 - is
19:12 - we want to make the dependency be
19:14 - dependent on pickup coordinates and drop
19:16 - off coordinates what's the point of this
19:18 - because if the pickup coordinates ever
19:20 - change or the drop-off coordinates ever
19:22 - change we need this entire page to
19:24 - refresh
19:26 - and give us the newest data
19:28 - if you don't put these here and these
19:31 - coordinates change
19:32 - it will never show the updated version
19:35 - that's not what you want so that's why
19:36 - we're putting this in our dependency
19:38 - array
19:40 - also
19:42 - let's give
19:43 - this entire thing a name so when it
19:45 - returns it'll save it in write duration
19:48 - okay
19:49 - and so we'll have access to right
19:51 - duration here
19:52 - cool so let's go down
19:55 - all right in price
19:56 - and here's what we're going to do i'm
19:58 - just going to say
20:02 - i'm going to put a dollar sign here and
20:04 - a plus sign okay and then here's what
20:06 - we're going to do i'm going to say
20:10 - ride duration
20:12 - multiplied by
20:15 - car dot multiplier
20:18 - okay and then we're just gonna do uh so
20:21 - you see it's giving us some numbers now
20:23 - over here
20:25 - boom if i remove this car multiplier you
20:28 - can see what it looks like right it
20:29 - looks like some weird number so let's
20:30 - give it a car multi uh i'm sorry not a
20:33 - weird number but it all looks like the
20:34 - same exact number right that's not what
20:37 - we want we want to get the car
20:39 - multiplier of black uber excel uber x
20:42 - are different yeah
20:44 - so let's go ahead and uh add them so i'm
20:47 - going to do right duration
20:49 - multiplied by car multiplier
20:52 - and now it's giving it to me to so many
20:54 - different decimal places that's not what
20:56 - i want guys so how do i make it so it
20:58 - only gives me the first two decimal
21:01 - places i'll give you guys five seconds
21:03 - five four three two one we're gonna do
21:07 - dot two fixed
21:09 - two just like that and this will make
21:12 - sure it gives us only two decimal places
21:15 - if you got it wrong
21:16 - it's all good i love your beautiful face
21:18 - yes too fixed absolutely yeah
21:21 - ah
21:22 - david jesus
21:24 - uh david says i knew
21:26 - i think what we know why he knew
21:30 - uh do you guys really need me to change

22:58 - amazing devlin says you're welcome hey
23:00 - we just got a three dollar donation

23:06 - okay so i'm calculating my fare price
23:10 - that's good
23:12 - and uh in terms of pr uh fair price
23:15 - calculation guys that's essentially it
23:17 - like if you followed along or at least
23:19 - you even understood
23:21 - that's really it like we're done with
23:23 - the fair price calculation okay if you
23:26 - guys enjoyed that
23:27 - smash that like button on youtube and
23:29 - give me a thumbs up on zoom and let's
23:30 - keep going
23:33 - awesome all right uh so let's go on to
23:36 - the next thing which is going to be
23:38 - let's add a
23:39 - back button right over here so when we
23:42 - hit it we actually leave
23:45 - all right and go to another screen so
23:46 - let's go ahead and take care of that now
23:53 - okay
23:54 - so we're going to still we're going to
23:55 - go to our confirm page
23:59 - and
24:00 - here what we're going to do is the
24:02 - following
24:04 - i'm going to say import link from
24:08 - next link
24:10 - okay now that is the link that's going
24:12 - to allow us to go back and forth between
24:15 - different pages
24:18 - okay
24:19 - and right over here we're going to now
24:22 - add our add our button okay so let's go
24:25 - ahead and do that so i'm going to say
24:27 - button container
24:30 - and inside of this button container we
24:32 - will put our link let's just uh
24:35 - let's link it to search
24:40 - and
24:41 - this will be a self-closing tag
24:43 - and then underneath here
24:45 - i want to add my back button itself
24:48 - and this will also be a self closing tag
24:51 - except we need to give it a source for
24:54 - an image
24:55 - and i'll copy paste the link here
25:00 - there we go
25:01 - so it's img dot icons dot eight dot co
25:04 - icons eight dot com slash ios filled
25:07 - slash fifty slash we have six zeros here
25:10 - slash left dot png
25:12 - okay so that's the main that's the
25:16 - structure that we want now we just need
25:18 - to create
25:19 - what
25:20 - we need to create the
25:22 - style components that define the styles
25:24 - for these so let's go down
25:27 - and let's go cons
25:29 - we need the
25:31 - button
25:34 - container
25:36 - let's just do that and then we're going
25:38 - to go back button
25:42 - and let's go h
25:43 - full object contain
25:46 - okay
25:48 - multiple children were passed to link
25:50 - all right so let's see what the problem
25:53 - is with link
25:59 - all right let's not make it a
26:00 - self-closing tag
26:02 - because we need this button to be the
26:04 - link right that's what we want there we
26:06 - go
26:09 - okay and let's x that out real quick
26:15 - all right and let's style the button
26:17 - container now because we have the button
26:19 - showing up now let's style the button
26:22 - container
26:25 - so i'm simply going to go let's go round
26:27 - it full
26:29 - i'm going to give it absolute let's put
26:31 - it in top 4
26:32 - left 4.
26:36 - now the reason why it's not showing up
26:38 - because it's behind the map because i
26:40 - did position absolute so we're going to
26:41 - give it a z index of 10. now it's
26:43 - showing up
26:44 - we're going to give it a background of
26:46 - white there we go
26:49 - we'll give it a um
26:52 - a box shadow
26:54 - and then when i hover over on it i want
26:56 - my cursor to become a pointer like this
26:59 - so now watch what happens when i hover
27:01 - over it
27:02 - boom look at that cursor becomes a
27:04 - pointer right that's exactly what we
27:06 - want so my button container is
27:08 - good to go
27:11 - all right
27:12 - so let's let's hit that back button and
27:15 - it worked right let's go santa monica
27:17 - let's go los angeles and hit confirm
27:20 - locations
27:21 - right and
27:23 - this is popping up our fair prices are
27:26 - showing up correctly
27:28 - okay
27:28 - and the button is showing up correctly
27:30 - and even when i click it it's taking me
27:33 - back
27:34 - that's what this part is doing this link
27:38 - okay
27:39 - so with that said now guys we are done
27:42 - with calculating the fair price adding
27:45 - in the back button
27:46 - the only thing we really need um at this
27:49 - point
27:50 - is we need to now add in the login page
27:55 - okay and the login page is gonna be
27:58 - uh this page right over here so this is
28:01 - the page we're now trying to build
28:04 - cool
28:07 - okay
28:09 - yeah so what i want you guys to do
28:14 - is yes you're right you guys caught this
28:16 - okay so see if you can figure out how to
28:19 - get rid of this bug but essentially it's
28:22 - getting an error when routes is not a
28:25 - thing it's like hey
28:27 - uh why am i getting this error i can't
28:29 - read the property so see if you can find
28:31 - a way where you can make that error go
28:33 - away for now we're going to keep going
28:35 - i'll leave that to you guys because this
28:37 - error really isn't stopping our app from
28:40 - working our app is still working the way
28:42 - that we want it to our points are being
28:44 - drawn in the correct places this is
28:46 - happening so if you can make that go
28:48 - away then cool but with that said now
28:51 - we're going to start working on the
28:52 - login page
28:54 - okay
28:56 - so for the login page we need to do a
28:58 - couple of things okay so first of all
29:01 - we are now going to need um
29:04 - we're now going to need a
29:06 - if i want to make a new page guys where
29:08 - do i go and where do i do it
29:12 - which folder do i do it in
29:16 - yes absolutely the pages folder all
29:19 - right so in the pages folder i'm going
29:21 - to create a new file
29:22 - and this file will be called what
29:27 - uh yes there boss dev on youtube the
29:30 - link is not a self-closing tag so thank
29:31 - you for that yes
29:33 - all right let's go login.js
29:38 - all right and let's go r f c e
29:41 - and for this login i'm going to
29:44 - capitalize the l so let's make that a
29:47 - capital l
29:48 - let's also make this a capital l over
29:50 - here
29:51 - these divs we're going to turn them into
29:54 - wrappers
29:56 - okay
29:57 - we should just call them snoop dogg from
29:58 - now on
30:01 - all right and then let's go ahead and
30:03 - let's go wrapper
30:05 - we got one lull thank you for that
30:08 - um and i'm gonna go and make it a td div
30:12 - just like this
30:15 - beautiful
30:17 - okay um and the next thing that i need
30:20 - inside of this is i need a sign in
30:22 - button all right so
30:25 - i should be able to navigate to this
30:27 - page
30:28 - so i'm going to change my
30:31 - localhost 3000 to
30:33 - slash login
30:34 - and let's hit that and let's see if it
30:36 - takes me
30:37 - all right so it's taking me but it's
30:39 - giving me an error saying tw is not
30:41 - defined
30:42 - so what do i need to do in order to
30:44 - define tw
30:49 - i need to probably
30:50 - import tw from tailwind styled
30:53 - components yes juan good job import
30:56 - tailwind import tilland nice good job
30:58 - all of you got it
30:59 - all right so now we're getting an empty
31:01 - page that's exactly what we wanted
31:04 - and we now need to do sign in
31:08 - button
31:10 - all right
31:14 - and inside of the sign in button i'm
31:15 - simply going to say sign in with google
31:18 - just like that
31:20 - okay it's going to complain it doesn't
31:22 - know what that is so we're going to go
31:23 - sign in const sign
31:26 - in button
31:31 - all right and we're just going to go
31:32 - tdw.tw
31:34 - dot button
31:36 - and we're just going to leave it with
31:37 - the styling so here you should have sign
31:39 - in with google
31:41 - now we need to start adding styling to
31:43 - this
31:44 - so i'm going to make the background
31:46 - black
31:49 - we'll make the text white
31:51 - okay
31:53 - we will
31:54 - centralize the text
31:56 - we will add padding in vertical form so
32:00 - it becomes fat but vertically
32:04 - we'll add some margins from the top and
32:06 - the bottom or from the top actually of
32:09 - eight
32:12 - okay
32:13 - and then what we're going to do is we're
32:14 - going to make sure that the width of it
32:16 - is full so it's taking up the full width
32:18 - of the screen
32:20 - and then we're going to make it cursor
32:21 - pointer so when i hover over on it
32:24 - it becomes a cursor pointer i don't
32:26 - think you need that because i think it's
32:27 - already a bun so let's take that away
32:29 - and see yeah you don't need that in this
32:31 - case because it's a button so that's why
32:34 - it's it's gonna work the way you expect
32:36 - it to
32:39 - and
32:40 - now we need to make it so like if you
32:42 - look at here
32:44 - notice that this button is not taking up
32:46 - the full width of the screen so what is
32:48 - happening well
32:49 - there's actually a wrapper that has
32:51 - styling and that wrapper is making sure
32:53 - all the stuff is contained in the center
32:55 - but not in a way where it's
32:57 - hitting the sides so that's going to be
32:59 - the important thing so let's go ahead
33:01 - and see how we can add
33:05 - these wrappers
33:07 - okay
33:08 - or style the wrapper
33:11 - cool so let's go ahead like this and i'm
33:13 - going to say flex
33:15 - let's give it a flex column we're going
33:17 - to make the height of the screen
33:19 - full width of the screen i'll show you
33:21 - what this means by doing adding the gray
33:23 - color to it so watch what happens so if
33:26 - i take away the height of the screen
33:28 - look it's not really filling up anything
33:31 - but when i do this i say take up the
33:33 - entire height of the screen and paint it
33:35 - gray
33:37 - okay i can also
33:39 - say
33:40 - w screen which is take the entire width
33:43 - of the screen and paint it gray
33:48 - all right
33:49 - and then i can just add padding four so
33:52 - that will add padding from all
33:54 - directions and squeeze it down in the
33:57 - middle all right squeeze everything
33:59 - inside of it
34:00 - into the middle
34:02 - all right so now all the boxes will
34:04 - start working fine so we got our button
34:06 - that's cool the next thing we need is
34:08 - this uber logo so let's go ahead and add
34:11 - that so in order to add that uber logo
34:14 - i'm simply going to do this which is
34:16 - i made my uber logo component and then i
34:19 - gave it a source which is just an image
34:21 - of uber logo
34:23 - it's a self-closing tag and now all i
34:26 - have to do is just style this uber logo
34:28 - so i'm going to say a const uber logo
34:34 - and we're going to go
34:35 - tw dot image
34:38 - and it's looking huge right so now we're
34:42 - going to fix this so let's go height of
34:44 - 20. so it became smaller but notice that
34:47 - it squished it as well
34:49 - so let's go w
34:51 - uh auto on the width okay
34:53 - and then what we're going to do
34:55 - with this is i want to go object contain
34:58 - that will make sure that it's like pixel
35:00 - perfect resolution wise
35:02 - okay and then we're going to go self
35:04 - start so it's going to put it itself at
35:06 - the start so essentially it's going to
35:08 - do flex start
35:11 - okay
35:12 - so our logo is looking correct now we
35:15 - need this login to access your account
35:17 - so let's go ahead and add that in
35:23 - let's go here and i'll create a title
35:25 - log
35:26 - in to access your account all right it
35:30 - says title is not defined no worries
35:33 - we're simply just going to do const
35:34 - title
35:35 - i'm going to tw
35:40 - and there we go we are seeing login to
35:42 - access your account but we're still
35:44 - going to need to
35:46 - style our title so let's go ahead and
35:49 - style it
35:51 - i will give it a very large text
35:54 - so how can i do that i'll do text 5 xl
36:00 - okay
36:01 - we're going to give it some padding from
36:03 - the top
36:05 - and we're going to now color it gray
36:08 - but not too gray so let's give it a 500
36:11 - which is in the middle and boom there
36:13 - you go now these are looking almost
36:15 - identical
36:16 - and the last thing we need is really
36:18 - just that image
36:20 - this image right over here and that'll
36:22 - finish it off
36:23 - so let's
36:25 - add that in
36:27 - okay
36:30 - okay so i added in head image as a
36:32 - component i gave it a source of whatever
36:35 - that image was okay login dash image.png
36:39 - it's also a self-closing tag just like
36:41 - the uber logo and now it's complaining
36:43 - it doesn't know what it is so let's go
36:45 - ahead and define it we'll say const head
36:46 - image
36:52 - all right and um we're just gonna say
36:56 - object
36:59 - contain
37:00 - and i'll say give it a full width now
37:03 - something interesting happened
37:06 - uh oh yeah let's put the image below the
37:09 - title so let's do that there we go
37:12 - all right so now if we look at these two
37:13 - pages they look completely identical
37:17 - right
37:18 - so style wise we are good to go but the
37:22 - only thing we don't have yet is when i
37:23 - click sign in with google
37:25 - no pop-up pops up right
37:28 - and so what do we need to add at this
37:30 - point
37:32 - we need to add the google pop-up and
37:34 - user authentication but what technology
37:36 - do we need to use to be able to add in
37:38 - that authentication
37:42 - yeah we're getting some answers coming
37:44 - in image copy paste yep
37:47 - yep
37:48 - firebase api yes we're going to be using
37:50 - firebase that's right okay and then
37:52 - within firebase it's going to be using
37:54 - the google api
37:56 - okay so let's open a new tab let's go
37:59 - firebase and go to firebase.com
38:03 - and what we'll do is we will go to
38:06 - console
38:08 - we'll add a new project we'll say uber
38:11 - next clone
38:13 - live
38:15 - hit continue
38:16 - i don't need any analytics enabled you
38:19 - guys can choose to have them i
38:22 - don't care for this project so i'm just
38:24 - going to have it off
38:28 - and once this is done i'm essentially
38:31 - going to get some
38:32 - credentials that it's going to give me
38:34 - and those are the credentials that are
38:36 - going to allow me to access my firebase
38:39 - okay
38:44 - so let's go here
38:47 - uh let's go back
38:50 - project settings
38:54 - web okay so let's register our app now
38:56 - let's register our app i'll call uber
38:58 - clone
38:59 - or sorry uber
39:02 - challenge clone
39:04 - it doesn't really matter what you name
39:05 - it we're not going to be hosting it on
39:08 - firebase so i'm going to leave this
39:09 - unchecked let's hit register app
39:15 - and um let's see oh wow we still have 62
39:18 - people on zoom what the heck
39:21 - that's nice sorry about 62 still at 62.
39:24 - great job guys
39:26 - um
39:28 - am i am i doing an alright job of
39:30 - explaining this for you guys by the way
39:32 - hopefully it's not too confusing for
39:33 - y'all
39:34 - okay hell yeah yes yes yes yep okay
39:37 - awesome thank you
39:38 - so let's keep going so now essentially
39:41 - what i want to do
39:43 - is i'm going to copy this entire thing
39:46 - all right and look it's even telling you
39:48 - to do npm install firebase so now we're
39:50 - going to do a couple of things
39:52 - i'm going to come over here and i'm
39:53 - going to say npm install firebase that's
39:55 - thing number one
39:57 - thing number two that i'm gonna do
40:01 - okay thing number two where did it go
40:06 - that's interesting
40:08 - i think i copied it already so we should
40:10 - be good
40:15 - super weird
40:22 - okay here we go so just simply go to
40:25 - project settings go to general scroll
40:28 - all the way down it should be there
40:30 - so copy this entire thing
40:33 - all right and then create a
40:36 - file
40:37 - in your home directory okay
40:40 - here next to all this stuff right here
40:42 - make sure it's at the same level go new
40:44 - file go firebase.js
40:47 - paste it in here copy pasta
40:52 - okay
40:54 - once you paste this in here we're going
40:56 - to need to do a couple of more things
41:01 - we're going to do import
41:04 - i'm going to need access to google
41:08 - auth
41:10 - provider
41:12 - and get auth
41:13 - and we're gonna get access to that from
41:15 - firebase auth
41:17 - okay
41:18 - so this google auth provider will be the
41:20 - thing that allows you to do that nice
41:21 - little pop-up okay i'll show you guys in
41:23 - a second so this is what you need get
41:25 - authors to see if the user is currently
41:27 - authenticated and whatnot and to be able
41:29 - to detect that
41:31 - we're initializing our app here with all
41:33 - of this information so this will make
41:35 - sure that it's the specific app for you
41:39 - and then i'm going to say const provider
41:42 - new google auth provider
41:45 - and then we're going to do auth is get
41:47 - auth like that
41:49 - okay
41:50 - and now we're gonna export this
41:53 - and what that means when i export it
41:54 - like this is other files will have
41:57 - access to your firebase app
42:00 - will have access to your google provider
42:03 - and your authentication
42:06 - that's what you're exporting here
42:12 - yep
42:14 - i'm a little lost but i'll figure it out
42:16 - we're here okay awesome it's a good
42:18 - attitude sam fuse
42:20 - uh it's not confusing but i'm behind so
42:22 - i'll watch and then do the project along
42:24 - with the video awesome that makes sense
42:25 - great
42:28 - yep demi lola yep you see it
42:34 - yep and uh you don't need to do cons db
42:37 - in this case
42:38 - because we're not going to be doing
42:39 - anything with the database that's why i
42:41 - didn't import it and it's and also this
42:43 - is firebase version nine so it has some
42:45 - different changes for those of you
42:46 - who've used this already for other for
42:49 - others of you who are beginners you're
42:51 - all good
42:53 - all right
42:54 - um
42:56 - crypto an anarchist on youtube says yo
42:58 - i've been following since part one
43:00 - mine's coming along perfect beautiful
43:02 - that's awesome to hear that's awesome
43:04 - okay cool so now
43:06 - let's start using all this firebase
43:09 - stuff that we just got
43:11 - inside
43:12 - of our login page
43:15 - so we're going to start importing all of
43:16 - this stuff so first of all let's go and
43:19 - get the help of use effect we're going
43:21 - to need some buddies to help us
43:23 - okay the other one we need is router so
43:27 - let's go use router
43:30 - from next router
43:31 - why do we need access to the router guys
43:34 - well
43:36 - we're gonna need to route from this sign
43:39 - in with google page
43:41 - to the next page after this
43:44 - yeah that's why we need access to the
43:46 - router
43:48 - okay
43:50 - we're also going to need
43:53 - access to
43:54 - sign in with
43:56 - pop-up
43:58 - this will pop up that nice google pop-up
44:01 - that allows you to click your email and
44:03 - then log in
44:05 - and we're going to need on auth state
44:07 - changed
44:08 - okay and then from
44:11 - this is the part it
44:13 - auto-completed incorrectly
44:16 - okay from we're going to say firebase
44:19 - auth
44:21 - okay firebase slash auth just like that
44:25 - those are the two things we need from
44:27 - there
44:27 - the other thing we're going to need is
44:29 - auth and the provider so this is a
44:32 - google provider from our own file that
44:34 - we created firebase that's this is
44:38 - referring to this file right over here
44:42 - and then what we need is let's go import
44:45 - and we'll go on autostay changed oh
44:48 - actually we don't need to do this
44:49 - because we already got our aunts on off
44:51 - to change so we're good we're good we're
44:53 - good there
44:54 - cool so with that said now we just
44:57 - simply need to um
45:00 - to make that work
45:04 - so we're going to go counts router
45:06 - we're going to initialize our router
45:08 - and then we're going to create our use
45:10 - effect hook
45:13 - give it an empty
45:15 - dependency array just for now and we're
45:17 - going to go
45:19 - that so we're going to go on all state
45:22 - changed
45:26 - on outside change get the auth
45:29 - okay and the user
45:30 - and if the user is if the user exists
45:35 - meaning if the user is logged in or
45:36 - exists
45:37 - then send me to the home page
45:40 - okay
45:43 - and the last thing i need to do is make
45:45 - sure that when i click the button
45:48 - um it actually
45:51 - makes the pop-up happen
45:53 - so that one is going to be really
45:54 - freaking simple just one line on click
45:59 - sign in with pop-up
46:02 - and we're going to give it auth and
46:03 - we're going to get give it the google
46:05 - provider and that's it sign in with
46:06 - pop-up so let's go sign in with google
46:09 - our pop-up opened up
46:11 - and
46:12 - now we're getting a different error okay
46:14 - so auth slash configuration not found
46:19 - so
46:19 - this error is happening because we
46:21 - didn't actually configure google so
46:24 - let's go back to our home
46:26 - and let's go to authentication here on
46:29 - the left hand side
46:34 - okay hit get started
46:39 - and on your additional providers simply
46:42 - select google
46:46 - and hit enable
46:47 - okay
46:48 - and support email sure let's go save
46:56 - okay it saved it beautiful so that part
46:59 - is now good to go so let's go back let's
47:02 - go to our app
47:03 - let's now refresh
47:06 - let's hit sign in with google
47:08 - and look at that you guys our google
47:11 - pop-up is opening up let's go hit quasi
47:14 - at cleverprogrammer.com and let's see if
47:15 - it redirects us to the home page
47:20 - yo
47:21 - and it does guys we did this in the
47:25 - first try look at that
47:29 - super freaking simple and so clean
47:32 - yes very helpful with use effect
47:35 - that's right
47:37 - awesome
47:38 - nice looks like you guys enjoyed that
47:40 - one i did too so that's it guys sign in
47:43 - with google authentication fully
47:45 - complete look
47:47 - the styling part was the one that we
47:49 - wrote a lot of lines of code on but look
47:51 - at the google login part boom that sign
47:54 - in with google
47:56 - on detect the state being changed push
47:58 - them to the home page that's it very
48:00 - very simple
48:02 - okay
48:03 - so
48:04 - we're now good with this
48:06 - and now what we need to do guys is we've
48:08 - added in the sign in ability now we need
48:11 - to add the
48:15 - sign
48:16 - out ability perfect dropping in the
48:18 - comments coming through that's awesome
48:22 - uh when you sign in with google can the
48:24 - app fetch the user's name for other
48:26 - functions damn uh dummy lola exactly
48:29 - you're right on the money so once we
48:31 - sign with google we get the user's
48:32 - information and we
48:34 - populate this and the photo from that so
48:37 - you're on to something good job
48:40 - sign out sign up that's right
48:42 - yes and looks like you guys really
48:44 - enjoyed that part so that's good that
48:46 - makes me really happy
48:48 - um
48:49 - crypto says i sound like a robot
48:52 - damn
48:54 - i mean i i i sure hope i don't but let's
48:56 - let's uh
48:57 - keep going
48:59 - uh let's see so let me hit refresh here
49:04 - cool so uh if i had if i hit my photo
49:07 - what i wanted to do is i wanted to send
49:09 - me back i wanted to send me
49:11 - back to the home page and also sign me
49:14 - out so that's the thing that
49:16 - we're gonna start working on
49:20 - let's go to our index page
49:27 - cool and let's not only get use effect
49:30 - but also get use state because we're
49:32 - going to need to manage the state
49:34 - and then we're going to need access to a
49:35 - couple of more things let's get auth
49:38 - from
49:39 - our firebase app that we made
49:43 - let's also import on auth state changed
49:47 - and sign out
49:50 - so this sign out will be coming from
49:53 - firebase
49:56 - slash auth
49:58 - so now we have access to sign out
50:00 - function and on auth state change
50:02 - function
50:08 - and we'll get access to the use router
50:10 - so we can navigate
50:12 - and go back a page
50:16 - cool so we got all these three things
50:19 - now let's
50:20 - create the
50:22 - user
50:23 - and in the start the user will be null
50:25 - all right
50:27 - and then i'm going to go and do
50:30 - initialize my router
50:32 - and now we'll use our use effect hook
50:38 - all right and then here i'm just going
50:40 - to say return
50:42 - and we'll do on odd state change so this
50:45 - is a on so this is a listener for
50:48 - whether the user is logged in or not
50:51 - that's what this is doing
50:54 - and we're going to say hey if the user
50:56 - is logged in
50:57 - then just set the user
51:00 - to the following
51:03 - user.display name so this guys will be
51:06 - getting the exact so let me show you
51:08 - something
51:10 - when you run this on not state changed
51:12 - this is a firebase function
51:14 - this user over here will be a firebase
51:17 - slash google user so it'll actually get
51:20 - your google user using this so it means
51:23 - it has access to properties like display
51:25 - name
51:26 - it'll be able to display the name of the
51:28 - user it'll be able to display their
51:30 - email it'll be able to display their
51:33 - access token and their profile picture
51:37 - so this user has access to all that
51:39 - information
51:40 - okay let's go name and we'll go photo
51:44 - url go user.photo url just like that
51:48 - okay
51:51 - and um
51:53 - and then what we're gonna say
51:56 - is else
51:59 - set user to empty meaning that's the
52:01 - meaning the user is not there
52:03 - essentially you've logged out at that
52:04 - point
52:05 - and then also
52:07 - push
52:09 - to log in
52:10 - okay
52:11 - so this is going to detect any state
52:12 - changes meaning when you log in or when
52:15 - you log out or whatever happens so when
52:18 - it detects the state change it's going
52:19 - to go inside of this if else condition
52:21 - so if it detects a state change where
52:23 - the user still exists
52:25 - then it's just going to set the user
52:27 - with the following properties
52:30 - if uh if the user does not exist else
52:34 - okay
52:35 - it's going to set the user to null and
52:38 - it's going to send you back to the login
52:40 - page
52:43 - cool
52:45 - and uh this thing that i'm doing here
52:47 - um is is is a nice way to
52:50 - you know for for those of you who are
52:52 - maybe a little bit more advanced this is
52:53 - a nice way to not have to do const
52:56 - unsubscribe and then return unsubscribe
52:58 - at the bottom
52:59 - i find this to be a nicer pattern than
53:01 - that
53:03 - okay so now this name needs to be pulled
53:06 - from the actual user and we have it hard
53:10 - coded here so we need to change this so
53:12 - let's go ahead and remove rafikaze from
53:14 - here and i'm simply going to say
53:16 - if the user exists
53:18 - then show me their username
53:25 - and i'm also going to say if the user
53:27 - exists show me their user.photo url just
53:31 - like that
53:32 - and there you go guys
53:34 - my actual
53:36 - photo is coming from firebase and my
53:38 - actual name display name is coming from
53:40 - firebase as well so hopefully you guys
53:42 - thought that that's or you guys think
53:44 - that that's pretty cool
53:52 - yep yep yep yep
53:55 - yep anthony loves it anthony says sick
53:58 - yeah so super nice i love how cool this
54:01 - is man i like it
54:03 - uh maybe i can see more of you guys here
54:06 - if i put it like a little bit like that
54:11 - okay cool i'm just gonna leave that
54:14 - here
54:15 - okay
54:17 - so we're good with this now all we need
54:19 - to do is make sure our sign out works as
54:22 - well so on this user image
54:24 - we're also going to go on click
54:27 - and i'm going to make an anonymous
54:29 - function and this function is going to
54:31 - say
54:32 - sign out
54:35 - yeah and give it off okay and end this
54:38 - just like this
54:40 - so now when i click this this is going
54:41 - to sign me out
54:44 - all right and the last thing i want to
54:46 - do is for this user image when i hover
54:48 - over it it doesn't look like it's a
54:50 - button or something clickable so we're
54:52 - gonna go to our user image down here
54:55 - and how are we gonna let me ask you guys
54:56 - this how will i do it where i hover over
54:58 - it and i'll make it look like it's a
55:00 - cursor

62:18 - i'll probably take questions for maybe
62:20 - five to seven minutes i don't want to
62:21 - take too long on the questions because i
62:23 - want to give you more time so you guys
62:25 - can finish off this project
62:28 - are you guys by the way like staying up
62:30 - on most of the days and
62:32 - and and doing the projects like what's
62:34 - what's uh your guys's schedule looking
62:36 - like
62:38 - all right we got some questions coming
62:40 - up so
62:41 - uh do you want to help out here amanath
62:43 - or david please
62:46 - and make sure to put them in spotlight
62:47 - as well so everybody can see it
62:51 - i'm keeping all right um
62:53 - so i i forgot to ask this earlier
62:56 - but i was trying to get my uh
62:59 - webs my project from yesterday up on
63:02 - traversal
63:03 - and
63:04 - i was getting npm errors
63:08 - but everything worked fine on my local
63:10 - machine whenever i did the uh
63:13 - live so the one hack that we found to
63:15 - get it pushed to so we'll show you
63:18 - uh don't know if it'll work for you or
63:20 - not but i think one of the things that
63:22 - we saw to do that is
63:24 - you literally just had to
63:27 - take this data right this data folder
63:31 - take it out from pages and put it at the
63:33 - global level
63:35 - and then okay and then in your
63:38 - ride selector where you're referencing
63:40 - your data
63:42 - just make sure that um
63:47 - you know it's actually
63:48 - going out and uh accessing that data
63:51 - correctly like this
63:53 - all right i'll do that and see if that
63:55 - fixes it thank you yeah you got it
63:58 - so for those of you are not deploying it
64:00 - you don't have to worry too much about
64:01 - what i just did here i'll go and even
64:04 - unchange
64:05 - um
64:06 - the changes that i just made
64:10 - uh where where did it go where's data
64:16 - where like the data go
64:18 - do you guys see it
64:23 - did you relate it by agent it's gone
64:27 - yeah what happened dude
64:30 - gone gone
64:32 - um okay oh wait wait it's it's there
64:35 - it's uh it's there i undid it that's
64:38 - fine okay cool so yeah that's good and
64:42 - then um
64:43 - and then yeah and then if everybody
64:45 - wants i can push this to
64:47 - commit
64:51 - okay i'm just gonna put in
64:57 - okay
64:58 - so it should be good to go for everybody
65:00 - and and i think david for everybody they
65:02 - should just be able to pull off the main
65:03 - branch right if they want
65:06 - that's correct okay yeah cool so we can
65:09 - give them uh a public repo of this so i
65:11 - don't know if this one is a public one
65:13 - or not let's give them a public one
65:16 - okay okay awesome so let's get out of
65:18 - this i'll stop screen sharing
65:21 - all right
65:23 - amazing having the rest of today yep
65:26 - usually say i've got most of my
65:28 - okay so more questions damilola let's
65:32 - take damilola hi
65:34 - hey you can hear me yes sir i can hear
65:36 - you hi
65:37 - uh um my question is just this because
65:40 - right after this tutorial i'm going to
65:42 - help um build the app for my job and um
65:45 - we use like microsoft suites so i was
65:47 - just wondering is it like a firebase
65:50 - version but for like office 365 and
65:52 - microsoft products
65:55 - um
65:56 - microsoft version for firebase
66:00 - there is something like that uh i can't
66:04 - remember the name
66:05 - is it isn't it like net isn't the net
66:08 - suite like microsoft stuff
66:11 - cloud
66:15 - azure does azure have it azure has it
66:18 - right something
66:19 - okay
66:20 - okay yeah yeah yeah that's the microsoft
66:22 - version of aws and firebase
66:25 - okay all right appreciate that yeah yeah
66:27 - there you go
66:30 - um awesome let's take on any more
66:32 - questions we have you guys can also ask
66:35 - questions in the chat i'll just be rapid
66:38 - fire taking them or maybe going deep
66:40 - into it we'll see
66:42 - okay
66:43 - anybody else
66:46 - uh now vr see you tomorrow make sure you
66:48 - finish the project
66:51 - thank you okay you got it brother
66:54 - um is there an extension that autofills
66:57 - like yours and vs code yes i have the
66:59 - most boss extension on planet earth it's
67:02 - it's so sick but you will need to kind
67:05 - of get lucky to access it it's called
67:06 - github co-pilot not lucky but like they
67:08 - have a wait list it's kind of weird but
67:11 - sign up for github copilot
67:14 - you'll have to sign up maybe on their
67:16 - website and
67:17 - once they allow you to go through you'll
67:19 - get approved and then you'll be able to
67:21 - get it and it's just it's the freaking
67:23 - best
67:25 - um hello
67:27 - hi
67:28 - hi um so
67:31 - i'm going to build um can we use like
67:33 - can we go through like i know you can
67:34 - use different components for other apps
67:37 - uh can we use the firebase
67:39 - as an example for
67:53 - yes
67:54 - yeah absolutely because the things that
67:57 - you used uh are timeless so like for
68:00 - example we set up firebase that's pretty
68:02 - much how you can set up firebase in most
68:04 - of your projects
68:06 - okay yeah the only thing that might
68:08 - change is depending on the type of
68:10 - project you're doing you might want to
68:11 - use a database so you might also will
68:13 - need access a database and stuff like
68:15 - that so now you'll need to add but in
68:17 - terms of the setup yeah it could be like
68:20 - this every single time so you could just
68:21 - use this project as a template for any
68:24 - new projects you do
68:26 - um
68:28 - doesn't use a database
68:30 - uber
68:31 - yeah we're not using a database for this
68:33 - one
68:36 - why not because right now for the uber
68:38 - clone that we did we're not storing any
68:40 - information anywhere oh okay
68:43 - yeah
68:44 - so like if we were to store information
68:46 - then we yeah then we would use it
68:50 - okay thank you yeah you got it
68:54 - um adries i'm so sorry i'm late it's all
68:57 - good we're happy you're here okay the
69:00 - recording will be there for you so make
69:01 - sure you get all caught up on that
69:06 - is it possible to create a i should do
69:08 - like community sessions with you guys
69:10 - honestly where we just code on the
69:12 - regular on over zoom but it'll be like
69:15 - way more beginner and designed to your
69:17 - guys's level
69:19 - um i don't know if you guys are down
69:20 - with that or if that sounds like a good
69:22 - idea but i'd love to do something where
69:24 - it's just like
69:25 - very like this is still like
69:27 - intermediate it gets advanced at times
69:29 - right like really beginner level stuff i
69:31 - think
69:32 - um
69:34 - iman is okay amani would be down okay
69:37 - cool
69:39 - awesome awesome
69:40 - um oh by the way guys i just a reminder
69:44 - we you i don't know if you guys remember
69:46 - but i did let you guys know that we have
69:48 - uh
69:49 - what's it called uh
69:51 - we have the uber challenge or sorry the
69:54 - react intensive coming up 19th to 21st
69:57 - so i know a couple of you guys reached
69:59 - out to me
70:01 - and we have now we're up to four spots
70:04 - four to five spots booked okay so we'll
70:06 - only have a couple of spots left for
70:07 - that so if you guys are interested it's
70:09 - on the 19th to 21st it'll be here before
70:12 - you know it and pretty soon we'll be
70:13 - letting our entire audience know about
70:15 - it outside of this challenge so get
70:18 - books if you're interested
70:19 - let me know or just send me a message
70:22 - here on zoom just drop it down here and
70:25 - then we can have our team follow up with
70:26 - you
70:29 - okay let's see
70:31 - other questions so drop your questions
70:34 - either in the chat or jump on and we'll
70:36 - help you
70:38 - oh the react intensive is a three-day
70:41 - event it's going to be extremely intense
70:44 - it's 30 hours of training in three days
70:47 - so it's eight to ten hours of training
70:48 - every single day each day you're going
70:50 - to be building a project
70:52 - by the end you'll have two to three
70:53 - projects fully completed on your
70:55 - portfolio
70:56 - and because we have so much more time
70:58 - and the complexity of the projects is
71:00 - not going to be like this uber level
71:02 - thing so it's going to be way more
71:03 - understandable i think for most of you
71:06 - and intermediates
71:07 - and yeah i mean what we saw last time we
71:09 - did it just skyrocketed people's skills
71:11 - so if you're considering it i would
71:13 - highly look into that
71:15 - um
71:19 - cool
71:22 - yeah
71:23 - one number yeah
71:25 - so yeah you guys can actually text me
71:28 - right over here
71:30 - uh david
71:31 - right
71:32 - yeah can you report
71:33 - 6657
71:36 - just making two to four what is it six
71:38 - five six
71:39 - yes so sean
71:42 - yeah yeah yeah okay so shoot me a text
71:45 - there guys and just say something like
71:47 - reaction
71:49 - just say hashtag intensive and uh two
71:52 - two four
71:58 - yeah i can put the number here as well
72:01 - so it's easy for everybody to see
72:03 - um let's go like this so it's one two
72:06 - two four six five one eight eight one
72:09 - seven
72:10 - and then you can just say
72:12 - uh hashtag intensive okay
72:15 - and
72:16 - you know either
72:17 - i or somebody will get in touch with you
72:20 - i'll personally reply to all of these
72:21 - messages and then we'll get on um and
72:23 - then we'll see if this is something
72:25 - you're interested in or or not okay so
72:27 - we can let you know of all the
72:28 - information you need there
72:30 - all right coming back
72:32 - to you guys let's go here
72:36 - stop sharing
72:38 - cool
72:39 - okay awesome
72:42 - uh at what time the react intensive is
72:44 - gonna be november 19th or 21st it's
72:46 - gonna be happening
72:48 - we'll have to get the the time down so
72:51 - don't quote me on this but it's gonna be
72:52 - around 10 a.m ish we we say that because
72:56 - sometimes uh you know depending on who
72:58 - we get we will schedule it around your
73:01 - guys schedule so right now we're maxing
73:03 - it out at um it out at about 10 to 15
73:06 - people we're not taking any more people
73:07 - than that because we want to have a
73:09 - small group of people and then work with
73:11 - you over 20-30 hours
73:15 - okay
73:16 - cool
73:17 - other questions what is copilot copilot
73:19 - is
73:22 - it will auto complete things for you in
73:24 - a really intelligent way
73:26 - i mean it's it's ridiculous at times it
73:28 - writes code for me it's it's freaky it
73:32 - is like
73:34 - take auto completion and just like put
73:36 - it on steroids
73:38 - and make it a human that's really smart
73:40 - and knows what you're going to do at
73:42 - lightning speed you just hit tab and
73:44 - things autocomplete it's pretty freaking
73:46 - awesome
73:49 - okay
73:50 - one more question why doesn't amazon
73:52 - close use db is it because you have to
73:53 - choose specific items so why we have a
73:56 - database for the amazon clone why do we
74:00 - what are we storing in there actually
74:02 - i'm trying to remember
74:04 - i actually
74:06 - do we have a database though i don't
74:08 - think we do no we don't we didn't use a
74:10 - database
74:11 - yeah i don't remember using use firebase
74:13 - just to store the documents
74:16 - but documents
74:18 - we didn't use like a postgres
74:20 - my sequel
74:21 - because
74:23 - they did use firestore
74:26 - yeah wait wait so what did we use
74:28 - firestore for in amazon so install the
74:30 - document no no i i no okay so david
74:33 - what like what documents what was in the
74:35 - documents that we were storing
74:37 - the products that uh that were showing
74:39 - up on the screen ah so we're like using
74:42 - redux to store and firebase okay
74:44 - interesting so yeah so it's like
74:46 - basically you can store the oh oh okay
74:49 - okay okay okay no no no so redux was for
74:51 - cart items
74:52 - and then the products yes yes yes the
74:55 - products are showing up on the screen
74:57 - albert they were coming from the
74:59 - database so that's the difference okay
75:01 - so albert for example this uber app that
75:03 - we built right
75:05 - you guys know how we did that listing
75:07 - with uh
75:09 - you guys know how we did that like car
75:11 - list and we just created this dummy file
75:12 - and we have this folder called data
75:15 - that
75:16 - should normally be on a database so you
75:18 - can put that on a database we just
75:19 - wanted to simplify it for you guys and
75:21 - scope it down to something smaller but
75:23 - if you guys want for bonus points you
75:25 - could take your car list
75:27 - and put it in firebase database which is
75:29 - called firestore
75:31 - and then pull the data from there
75:36 - cool all right
75:39 - how to apply for react so lm so send a
75:43 - text yeah okay so you got the answer to
75:45 - that yes send the text message yes
75:47 - okay
75:49 - uh-huh
75:53 - eduardo send a text message not a
75:57 - uh zoom chat and a text message to the
76:00 - phone number that we provided and then
76:02 - we'll be able to help
76:03 - so like leela sent a text message i see
76:06 - yours
76:07 - bushra
76:08 - i think bushra did edna did vishal did
76:11 - dakota did sharon did
76:14 - yeah
76:15 - okay
76:23 - what is the exact name of the copal
76:25 - extension that you use i literally think
76:26 - it's called github copilot that's it i
76:28 - don't think there is anything else
76:31 - outside of it
76:32 - all right uh i'll take questions for two
76:35 - more minutes so any questions if you
76:36 - guys want to jump on you you're welcome
76:38 - to jump on just raise your hands we'll
76:40 - be able to bring you on or drop your
76:42 - questions in the chat
76:48 - thank you for con for another donation
76:50 - by the way that is absolutely incredible
76:52 - thank you
76:57 - uh cryptoanarchist says you are a
77:00 - blockchain engineer on youtube that's
77:03 - incredible
77:04 - uh what i think
77:06 - hold on
77:10 - uh crypto anarchist text me where i just
77:12 - dropped the number in youtube chat text
77:14 - me there i'd love to chat with you
77:16 - because that's that's incredible we're
77:18 - actually trying to help other students
77:20 - become
77:21 - blockchain engineers as well so that's
77:23 - super cool love to talk to you about
77:24 - that
77:31 - is it possible to create a hosted live
77:33 - website and have an admin that uploads
77:35 - new items into the website like buy this
77:36 - new item albert absolutely so you can
77:39 - make things with react and then you can
77:42 - even like build admin dashboards which
77:44 - allows admins to easily add in products
77:47 - and things like that what i recommend
77:48 - you do is
77:50 - um
77:51 - essentially for admins you want them to
77:54 - be able to point and click and do things
77:56 - and you don't want to spend too much
77:57 - time coding that side up so what i'd
77:59 - recommend is look into something called
78:01 - sanity.io
78:04 - and
78:05 - what that is is it allows you to be able
78:08 - to let's see here okay let's see if i
78:10 - can just pull it up for you guys so
78:13 - um
78:16 - okay
78:18 - um i'm not sharing my screen right now
78:20 - right am i sharing my screen
78:23 - no you're not
78:24 - okay so let's go sanity
78:26 - io
78:29 - and then click it
78:31 - okay
78:35 - there we go and i'll share my screen
78:36 - with you guys
78:38 - boom so here's sanity i o okay
78:42 - and these are all like content
78:43 - management platforms so they're called
78:45 - like cms okay
78:47 - it's called uh
78:50 - they're cmss
78:51 - and they make oh did they just make like
78:54 - things very point and clicky
78:57 - so if you have admin they can easily add
79:00 - things to your react app you'll just
79:02 - have to connect sanity
79:04 - with react and then essentially for
79:06 - admins and things like that will give
79:08 - them point and click functionality to
79:09 - add in data remove data add a blog post
79:12 - write a blog post and it already looks
79:13 - nice and all of that
79:15 - and that's managed by sanity so
79:18 - look into that like for example like
79:20 - this
79:20 - so you'll just be able to add a title an
79:23 - image add a product hit publish and then
79:25 - from your react app you can just pull
79:27 - the data from sanity and display it okay
79:31 - so that's what i would recommend
79:32 - honestly it's like the best experience
79:35 - it's fast you'll not have to spend years
79:38 - coding it up
79:39 - you know westboss recommends it too so i
79:41 - would mix it up with your projects
79:45 - um
79:47 - yeah so definitely give
79:49 - give sanity a try out and then there's
79:51 - this girl on youtube that keeps that
79:53 - makes a lot of sanity i o like tutorials
79:55 - would react i forget her name
79:57 - um
79:58 - i think she lives in hawaii or something
80:00 - she always starts it off with aloha
80:03 - but she's good so watch her watch her
80:05 - stuff it'll help you
80:12 - okay
80:13 - let's see
80:21 - okay that was a good question by the way
80:23 - apollo pulse chain is going to be
80:25 - awesome what's paul's chain
80:27 - pulse chain
80:30 - the launch of pulse chain
80:34 - looks phenomenal actually looks really
80:36 - cool
80:37 - here we go energy efficient cheaper
80:40 - faster fee burning ethereum fork wow
80:44 - the pulse chain sacrifice phase raised
80:46 - millions of dollars support descends dot
80:47 - org medical reserves the sacrifice phase
80:50 - is over do not sacrifice any more money
80:54 - wow we raised 25 million dollars for
80:57 - medical so far you must follow the
81:02 - okay what is this though
81:05 - um
81:05 - [Music]
81:07 - i guess it's some technology with
81:09 - ethereum that makes the gas fee free or
81:12 - something i don't know i don't
81:14 - or maybe cheaper so
81:17 - that would be pretty cool because i know
81:19 - for uh
81:20 - most of this ethereum and bitcoin stuff
81:22 - the gas fees kind of get out of control
81:25 - but let's get back to coding let's not
81:27 - jump too much into the nft bitcoin world
81:33 - okay
81:37 - awesome all right
81:39 - last minute any questions concerns
81:42 - anything you all want to bring up want
81:44 - to jump on talk to me about something

85:28 - the people like maybe even david uh set
85:30 - up on a call with you and essentially be
85:33 - able to help you deploy it
85:35 - yeah that would work thank you okay you
85:38 - got it so just say like hashtag deploy
85:40 - or something send me a text um and we'll
85:44 - be able to take care of it okay

Cleaned transcript:

what is up youtube welcome to day four of the next and react challenge we're gonna be building uber and finishing it off so this is day three of the uber build it's gonna be absolutely phenomenal we're gonna finish it off strong okay and the project is gonna be complete okay um and we'll be giving you uh the source code at the end but don't let that be the reason you become lazy and don't follow along okay so still follow along still code along and still learn along so i'm going to share the screen and kind of walk all of you guys through what the day is looking like right now so here we go so this is day four this is part three of the uber build uh by the way did you guys enjoy the uber build so far give me a thumbs up or drop it in the chat or something so i can see dakota peter nadir yes okay loving the energy thank you for that appreciate it um cool all right let's go next now who's ready to finish building their uber clone strong you guys ready yeah nice okay cool awesome so guys let's do this uh again if you want to tag us on instagram tag us on clever quasi or not stamansky we love your guys stories and we repost them now here's a quick recap of day three we got seven and a half thousand views on youtube not bad pretty decent we had 250 of you watching live that was awesome and we got 30 plus homework submissions so thank you guys for that and great job for those of you who submitted the homework and look even if you haven't it's all good i'm just proud of you that you showed up today okay we have 62 people live let's keep that up so juliana bernell and eric strath have not only built this out so far but they also deployed it to versailles so great job you guys guys let's give them a big round of applause even if you're on mute just give a round of applause because we can see it we can feel that energy so awesome job juliana and eric awesome awesome job and it looks really great i can see their profile photos their names are looking good uh great job here are three other people yo we got dakota riley in the house with the submission on the left nice job we got dirk kinley in the middle and we got jay garcia on the right guys let's give it up for all three of them as well awesome job with your day four submissions fantastic and uh don't feel bad guys you know if we didn't show yours submission we still love you okay um and let's go over what's the agenda for today all right let's go over what's the agenda for today let's see if my live is showing up because i want to be able to watch it myself as well okay cool um so let's uh do this here great now here's the agenda so this is day four we're going to finish off building the uber clone with next js react.js and tailwind and then tomorrow we're going to be doing your roadmap to becoming a frontend developer in 90 days okay and what time guys are we doing that can you can y'all drop it and chat and let me know what time we're meeting tomorrow okay uh and here's what we're going to be building today by the way so if you guys said 5 p.m pacific good job that's exactly when we're going to be doing this and what's up youtube i'm seeing all of you too and i'm seeing all of your comments all right so we're going to build a login page today because we haven't built that yet you guys have already built the home page you guys have already built the search page and you guys are pretty much done with the confirm ride page but on the confirm ride page we still need to calculate the fares meaning the pricing so where you see that twenty dollars and thirty dollars and twenty two cents we're going to be calculating that and finishing that portion up this side i'm hungry i loved it i'm hungry and i'm tired of this coding thing that's okay that sentiment i feel that very often so thank you for that that's a very very uh common sentiment um awesome so here we go we're gonna get started with first finishing off this page so we're gonna build this fare that's number one what we're gonna do we're gonna build this thing number two we're gonna add this back button so you're able to go back to one of these pages if you hit it and then we're gonna build this login page so there it's just three things we're gonna build is that clear to all of you guys just give me a thumbs up it's clear what we're doing today okay awesome uh cool i didn't see thumbs up from everybody so maybe i confused you guys let me know and if that's the case i can uh explain it again but okay awesome uh thumbs up coming through now beautiful and again stick to day five we got something special coming for you guys so with that said let's get started uh with today's training and we'll give you homework at the end okay so hopefully you guys should be able to see my screen and you guys are able to see uh code here correct okay good awesome david you can see code yes thumbs up okay cool cool cool just making sure we're seeing the right screen here all right beautiful so let's get started um on calculating the fair price so let's go here and let's go santa monica and let's go los angeles and david if you want to play any like lofi noncopyrighted music that'd be cool just give a good vibe so here we have uh everything is essentially 24 but that's not what we want right we want to be able to calculate an actual fair price that everybody can see so let's go ahead and do that and it needs to be calculated dynamically so in my ride selector what i'm going to do is i need access of a few to a few friends one i need my use effect and i need my use state now why i need my use state is i need to manage the state of something as it changes okay and use effect will allow me to like call my api in an easy way and will make sure my page doesn't crash and just keeps doing it over and over again okay so that's that so let's come over here and i'm just going to say ride duration because we're going to also calculate the right duration and we're going to set the right duration and we're going to be doing a little hack guys to calculate our ride price and essentially we're going to be doing is ride duration is going to tell me hey how many seconds or how many minutes is it going to take me from going from los angeles to santa monica we're going to take that number of seconds and we're just going to multiply that by this like multiplier here right this multiplier is based on whether it's an uber excel uber excel or an uber x okay so for example this uber acts as a multiplier of one so let's just say the distance was 2400 seconds i'm just giving a dummy example if the distance was 2400 seconds then it might just give us 24. okay but for uber excel the multiplier is going to be 1.5 which means that 24 dollars multiplied by 1.5 what would that be guys they'll probably be 30 something dollars right so that's what we're gonna get okay maybe close to 40 to 40ish or 35 or something like that that's what that's gonna become so hopefully that makes sense on how we're gonna go about and do this but the first thing we need is the right duration okay the next thing we need uh is here's what we're gonna do we're gonna we're gonna call our use effect hook okay and uh let me keep the zoom chat somewhere where i can see it nice i'm getting lots of 36's beautiful my corn dog exploded in the microwave be right back i love uh i love zoom chat oh no all right yeah better take care of it come back fast so what i'm going to do with this use effect hook is the following okay so the first argument is going to be my anonymous function the second argument is my dependencies so we'll put something in the dependency array as well and i'll show you guys what we're going to put in just a second and let's go ahead and call a fetch request and with this fetch request i want to call my mapbox api okay so let me put here what we're going to be doing and why we're doing this okay so get ride duration from mapbox api so what's nice is i don't have to calculate the distance or the right duration mapbox will actually help me do that and in order for it to do that it needs two things okay and here are the two things that it needs it needs a pickup destination all right and then it needs a dropoff destination all right so those are the two things it needs let me write that down pick up coordinates and then it needs dropoff coordinates okay so just keep that in mind as we go along because that's going to be very helpful for us okay so i'm calling fetch fetch allows me to make a request to an api and we're just going to say hey go to mapbox.coms api go to directions we're going to hit version 5 of mapbox driving and then i am going to uh basically now put in my coordinates that's now is when i actually need it okay so i'm going to put a dollar sign here and here's what we need to do you guys see this quote that we have here instead of a single quote like this i'm going to put backticks and backtick is if you're on a mac it's the button to the to the left top left of your one all right i'm going to put a backtick here as well and you guys should write this down this is called template literal this is something that's going to be helpful for you to learn even as a beginner okay just write that down template literal you can learn it at a later point i'll kind of show you uh why we're using it because this whole thing is a string but i want to be able to add in some variables into it so now i'll be able to add them right here cool template literal that's right template literal cool um all right and now i'm going to say pick up coordinates coordinates of 0 and then i'm going to say i'm going to get out of here i'm going to put a comma right there put a dollar sign and then do it again and this time i will say pick up coordinates again so i'll just paste it in here except i'll put a one all right so what's happening here quasi why are we having to pick up coordinates well here's why let's go here all right so for this pickup coordinate here guys we need two points one that tells us where it is on the xaxis pretty much and then one that tells us where it is on the yaxis so essentially if i get those two points it gives me this exact pin does that make sense guys why we need two different points okay so we need two points for the um to be very clear let's say this is the pickup so we need two points for the pickup location and then we need two points for the dropoff location yes sam exactly that's right so that's that's why we need that okay so let's go ahead and uncomment this out right now and uh now what we need to do is put a semicolon and then i'm going to take all of this here copy it and i'm going to paste it after the semicolon and instead of pick up coordinates we're going to now change the pick up word to drop off drop off just like that okay here let's do it again drop off so we got two points for drop off two points for pickup okay now you might be wondering hey because where are you getting this variable pickup coordinates from where the heck is this coming from um here's where it's coming from let's go to our confirm.js and let's go down to our ride selector component all right let's go all the way down to our right selector component right here now you see how to the map component you're passing pickup coordinates and drop off coordinates copy that we're going to paste it here and essentially what we're doing is we're passing those coordinates to right selector as well now command click on right selector go back to your write selector component and now right selector will have access to those okay so all we're going to do now to get access to those props is i'm just going to destructure here and we're going to say pick up coordinates and drop off coordinates and that alone right there gets you access to them okay let's go over here oh one more thing that we need to do while we're getting this error let's go back to confirm.js one last time and here's what we're going to do we're defining pickup coordinates here and drop off coordinates here so here in the u state we're just going to make an array and give it a 0 0 just like this this might be north pole or some something crazy like that so we give it zero zero here and we get give it a zero zero here okay let's go back into our ride selector and let's hit refresh okay it says failed to fetch so the reason why it's failing to fetch right now is because i still haven't given it an access token so i gave it all of this but i need to still give it an access token because it's like hey i need that part as well so we're going to put a question mark here and we're going to go access underscore token is equal to and whatever your long token is you're just going to put that here so i'm gonna take my token all right and i'm just gonna paste it right there just like that boom okay so that's all that's happening here i just added an x put a question mark and then i added my access token after it okay and so now that error has stopped it has went away that error is not there anymore uh jealousy says my understanding is next.js is just react with builtin routers and some other things you can think of it like that at a very simple to understand level the other benefits of it are serverside rendering which we're not going to get too much into in this challenge but maybe outside of this challenge on youtube i can show you guys the benefits of server side rendering if you guys want to see them yeah that makes sense it's long yeah it's very long kisly yeah makes sense cool i'm gonna try to keep reading all of your guys's comments too as we go through it and and chat messages so keep dropping them and and i'll keep an eye out for them okay so that's happening now once we receive this fetch request here's what we want to do i'm going to say then i'm going to do something once i receive it and i'm simply going to say you know whatever the response is get me the res.json so get me the json from that response and then i'm going to say dot then okay get the data and simply set the right duration to be data.routes of 0 divided by 100. and i'll explain what this means so when we get back the data from the api when we make this request we're look we're giving it all the coordinates right we're giving it we're giving it point a the pickup point we're giving it point b and when we give it those points to the api what it spits back out is a bunch of routes so it goes hey there's like route a right here is route b and each of these routes and they might have route c okay and uh if you looked at them you know how in google it'll tell you like hey here's route one and then here's the other route you know and then here's like some other route what we're saying is just give us this route right here like give us route a i don't care about uh if you have route b and i don't care about route c just give us route a and usually that's the best route and that's why we're saying routes of zero because it might have given us multiple routes does that make sense guys okay i'm getting getting thumbs up okay cool awesome so that's essentially what that data routes of zero is saying now this divided by 100 that's just completely made up okay this is there's no need for that the only reason i have that is so then when we see these numbers they won't look like 24 000 they'll look like 24 so that's all this is just to like make it a little bit more realistic in our calculations okay it's just completely made up divided by 100 just to make that number small whatever number that this gives us okay because it's going to give us a duration in seconds so we're going to divide it by 100 and then use that as our as our price okay last thing for this use effect hook what we want to do is we want to make the dependency be dependent on pickup coordinates and drop off coordinates what's the point of this because if the pickup coordinates ever change or the dropoff coordinates ever change we need this entire page to refresh and give us the newest data if you don't put these here and these coordinates change it will never show the updated version that's not what you want so that's why we're putting this in our dependency array also let's give this entire thing a name so when it returns it'll save it in write duration okay and so we'll have access to right duration here cool so let's go down all right in price and here's what we're going to do i'm just going to say i'm going to put a dollar sign here and a plus sign okay and then here's what we're going to do i'm going to say ride duration multiplied by car dot multiplier okay and then we're just gonna do uh so you see it's giving us some numbers now over here boom if i remove this car multiplier you can see what it looks like right it looks like some weird number so let's give it a car multi uh i'm sorry not a weird number but it all looks like the same exact number right that's not what we want we want to get the car multiplier of black uber excel uber x are different yeah so let's go ahead and uh add them so i'm going to do right duration multiplied by car multiplier and now it's giving it to me to so many different decimal places that's not what i want guys so how do i make it so it only gives me the first two decimal places i'll give you guys five seconds five four three two one we're gonna do dot two fixed two just like that and this will make sure it gives us only two decimal places if you got it wrong it's all good i love your beautiful face yes too fixed absolutely yeah ah david jesus uh david says i knew i think what we know why he knew uh do you guys really need me to change my font is this this big of a problem i'm hearing complaints in chat sometimes i'm hearing complaints on youtube i mean come on guys does that big of a problem if it is i might change it it would be amazing if you changed it okay all right now i just need to know how to freaking change my font all right how do we do this font anybody know how to change font fast i think this happened last time and i couldn't figure it out um on the bottom left uhhuh you can change the font from there where text editor yeah um uh i thought i did right it's fine now remember now scroll up remove the is that it does that do it yes okay all right you guys good now or everybody is everybody happy now okay um okay so hopefully that fixed it i don't exactly know what it did it doesn't even look any different to me honestly but cool okay let's keep on going amazing devlin says you're welcome hey we just got a three dollar donation thank you so much waffy appreciate it okay so i'm calculating my fare price that's good and uh in terms of pr uh fair price calculation guys that's essentially it like if you followed along or at least you even understood that's really it like we're done with the fair price calculation okay if you guys enjoyed that smash that like button on youtube and give me a thumbs up on zoom and let's keep going awesome all right uh so let's go on to the next thing which is going to be let's add a back button right over here so when we hit it we actually leave all right and go to another screen so let's go ahead and take care of that now okay so we're going to still we're going to go to our confirm page and here what we're going to do is the following i'm going to say import link from next link okay now that is the link that's going to allow us to go back and forth between different pages okay and right over here we're going to now add our add our button okay so let's go ahead and do that so i'm going to say button container and inside of this button container we will put our link let's just uh let's link it to search and this will be a selfclosing tag and then underneath here i want to add my back button itself and this will also be a self closing tag except we need to give it a source for an image and i'll copy paste the link here there we go so it's img dot icons dot eight dot co icons eight dot com slash ios filled slash fifty slash we have six zeros here slash left dot png okay so that's the main that's the structure that we want now we just need to create what we need to create the style components that define the styles for these so let's go down and let's go cons we need the button container let's just do that and then we're going to go back button and let's go h full object contain okay multiple children were passed to link all right so let's see what the problem is with link all right let's not make it a selfclosing tag because we need this button to be the link right that's what we want there we go okay and let's x that out real quick all right and let's style the button container now because we have the button showing up now let's style the button container so i'm simply going to go let's go round it full i'm going to give it absolute let's put it in top 4 left 4. now the reason why it's not showing up because it's behind the map because i did position absolute so we're going to give it a z index of 10. now it's showing up we're going to give it a background of white there we go we'll give it a um a box shadow and then when i hover over on it i want my cursor to become a pointer like this so now watch what happens when i hover over it boom look at that cursor becomes a pointer right that's exactly what we want so my button container is good to go all right so let's let's hit that back button and it worked right let's go santa monica let's go los angeles and hit confirm locations right and this is popping up our fair prices are showing up correctly okay and the button is showing up correctly and even when i click it it's taking me back that's what this part is doing this link okay so with that said now guys we are done with calculating the fair price adding in the back button the only thing we really need um at this point is we need to now add in the login page okay and the login page is gonna be uh this page right over here so this is the page we're now trying to build cool okay yeah so what i want you guys to do is yes you're right you guys caught this okay so see if you can figure out how to get rid of this bug but essentially it's getting an error when routes is not a thing it's like hey uh why am i getting this error i can't read the property so see if you can find a way where you can make that error go away for now we're going to keep going i'll leave that to you guys because this error really isn't stopping our app from working our app is still working the way that we want it to our points are being drawn in the correct places this is happening so if you can make that go away then cool but with that said now we're going to start working on the login page okay so for the login page we need to do a couple of things okay so first of all we are now going to need um we're now going to need a if i want to make a new page guys where do i go and where do i do it which folder do i do it in yes absolutely the pages folder all right so in the pages folder i'm going to create a new file and this file will be called what uh yes there boss dev on youtube the link is not a selfclosing tag so thank you for that yes all right let's go login.js all right and let's go r f c e and for this login i'm going to capitalize the l so let's make that a capital l let's also make this a capital l over here these divs we're going to turn them into wrappers okay we should just call them snoop dogg from now on all right and then let's go ahead and let's go wrapper we got one lull thank you for that um and i'm gonna go and make it a td div just like this beautiful okay um and the next thing that i need inside of this is i need a sign in button all right so i should be able to navigate to this page so i'm going to change my localhost 3000 to slash login and let's hit that and let's see if it takes me all right so it's taking me but it's giving me an error saying tw is not defined so what do i need to do in order to define tw i need to probably import tw from tailwind styled components yes juan good job import tailwind import tilland nice good job all of you got it all right so now we're getting an empty page that's exactly what we wanted and we now need to do sign in button all right and inside of the sign in button i'm simply going to say sign in with google just like that okay it's going to complain it doesn't know what that is so we're going to go sign in const sign in button all right and we're just going to go tdw.tw dot button and we're just going to leave it with the styling so here you should have sign in with google now we need to start adding styling to this so i'm going to make the background black we'll make the text white okay we will centralize the text we will add padding in vertical form so it becomes fat but vertically we'll add some margins from the top and the bottom or from the top actually of eight okay and then what we're going to do is we're going to make sure that the width of it is full so it's taking up the full width of the screen and then we're going to make it cursor pointer so when i hover over on it it becomes a cursor pointer i don't think you need that because i think it's already a bun so let's take that away and see yeah you don't need that in this case because it's a button so that's why it's it's gonna work the way you expect it to and now we need to make it so like if you look at here notice that this button is not taking up the full width of the screen so what is happening well there's actually a wrapper that has styling and that wrapper is making sure all the stuff is contained in the center but not in a way where it's hitting the sides so that's going to be the important thing so let's go ahead and see how we can add these wrappers okay or style the wrapper cool so let's go ahead like this and i'm going to say flex let's give it a flex column we're going to make the height of the screen full width of the screen i'll show you what this means by doing adding the gray color to it so watch what happens so if i take away the height of the screen look it's not really filling up anything but when i do this i say take up the entire height of the screen and paint it gray okay i can also say w screen which is take the entire width of the screen and paint it gray all right and then i can just add padding four so that will add padding from all directions and squeeze it down in the middle all right squeeze everything inside of it into the middle all right so now all the boxes will start working fine so we got our button that's cool the next thing we need is this uber logo so let's go ahead and add that so in order to add that uber logo i'm simply going to do this which is i made my uber logo component and then i gave it a source which is just an image of uber logo it's a selfclosing tag and now all i have to do is just style this uber logo so i'm going to say a const uber logo and we're going to go tw dot image and it's looking huge right so now we're going to fix this so let's go height of 20. so it became smaller but notice that it squished it as well so let's go w uh auto on the width okay and then what we're going to do with this is i want to go object contain that will make sure that it's like pixel perfect resolution wise okay and then we're going to go self start so it's going to put it itself at the start so essentially it's going to do flex start okay so our logo is looking correct now we need this login to access your account so let's go ahead and add that in let's go here and i'll create a title log in to access your account all right it says title is not defined no worries we're simply just going to do const title i'm going to tw and there we go we are seeing login to access your account but we're still going to need to style our title so let's go ahead and style it i will give it a very large text so how can i do that i'll do text 5 xl okay we're going to give it some padding from the top and we're going to now color it gray but not too gray so let's give it a 500 which is in the middle and boom there you go now these are looking almost identical and the last thing we need is really just that image this image right over here and that'll finish it off so let's add that in okay okay so i added in head image as a component i gave it a source of whatever that image was okay login dash image.png it's also a selfclosing tag just like the uber logo and now it's complaining it doesn't know what it is so let's go ahead and define it we'll say const head image all right and um we're just gonna say object contain and i'll say give it a full width now something interesting happened uh oh yeah let's put the image below the title so let's do that there we go all right so now if we look at these two pages they look completely identical right so style wise we are good to go but the only thing we don't have yet is when i click sign in with google no popup pops up right and so what do we need to add at this point we need to add the google popup and user authentication but what technology do we need to use to be able to add in that authentication yeah we're getting some answers coming in image copy paste yep yep firebase api yes we're going to be using firebase that's right okay and then within firebase it's going to be using the google api okay so let's open a new tab let's go firebase and go to firebase.com and what we'll do is we will go to console we'll add a new project we'll say uber next clone live hit continue i don't need any analytics enabled you guys can choose to have them i don't care for this project so i'm just going to have it off and once this is done i'm essentially going to get some credentials that it's going to give me and those are the credentials that are going to allow me to access my firebase okay so let's go here uh let's go back project settings web okay so let's register our app now let's register our app i'll call uber clone or sorry uber challenge clone it doesn't really matter what you name it we're not going to be hosting it on firebase so i'm going to leave this unchecked let's hit register app and um let's see oh wow we still have 62 people on zoom what the heck that's nice sorry about 62 still at 62. great job guys um am i am i doing an alright job of explaining this for you guys by the way hopefully it's not too confusing for y'all okay hell yeah yes yes yes yep okay awesome thank you so let's keep going so now essentially what i want to do is i'm going to copy this entire thing all right and look it's even telling you to do npm install firebase so now we're going to do a couple of things i'm going to come over here and i'm going to say npm install firebase that's thing number one thing number two that i'm gonna do okay thing number two where did it go that's interesting i think i copied it already so we should be good super weird okay here we go so just simply go to project settings go to general scroll all the way down it should be there so copy this entire thing all right and then create a file in your home directory okay here next to all this stuff right here make sure it's at the same level go new file go firebase.js paste it in here copy pasta okay once you paste this in here we're going to need to do a couple of more things we're going to do import i'm going to need access to google auth provider and get auth and we're gonna get access to that from firebase auth okay so this google auth provider will be the thing that allows you to do that nice little popup okay i'll show you guys in a second so this is what you need get authors to see if the user is currently authenticated and whatnot and to be able to detect that we're initializing our app here with all of this information so this will make sure that it's the specific app for you and then i'm going to say const provider new google auth provider and then we're going to do auth is get auth like that okay and now we're gonna export this and what that means when i export it like this is other files will have access to your firebase app will have access to your google provider and your authentication that's what you're exporting here yep i'm a little lost but i'll figure it out we're here okay awesome it's a good attitude sam fuse uh it's not confusing but i'm behind so i'll watch and then do the project along with the video awesome that makes sense great yep demi lola yep you see it yep and uh you don't need to do cons db in this case because we're not going to be doing anything with the database that's why i didn't import it and it's and also this is firebase version nine so it has some different changes for those of you who've used this already for other for others of you who are beginners you're all good all right um crypto an anarchist on youtube says yo i've been following since part one mine's coming along perfect beautiful that's awesome to hear that's awesome okay cool so now let's start using all this firebase stuff that we just got inside of our login page so we're going to start importing all of this stuff so first of all let's go and get the help of use effect we're going to need some buddies to help us okay the other one we need is router so let's go use router from next router why do we need access to the router guys well we're gonna need to route from this sign in with google page to the next page after this yeah that's why we need access to the router okay we're also going to need access to sign in with popup this will pop up that nice google popup that allows you to click your email and then log in and we're going to need on auth state changed okay and then from this is the part it autocompleted incorrectly okay from we're going to say firebase auth okay firebase slash auth just like that those are the two things we need from there the other thing we're going to need is auth and the provider so this is a google provider from our own file that we created firebase that's this is referring to this file right over here and then what we need is let's go import and we'll go on autostay changed oh actually we don't need to do this because we already got our aunts on off to change so we're good we're good we're good there cool so with that said now we just simply need to um to make that work so we're going to go counts router we're going to initialize our router and then we're going to create our use effect hook give it an empty dependency array just for now and we're going to go that so we're going to go on all state changed on outside change get the auth okay and the user and if the user is if the user exists meaning if the user is logged in or exists then send me to the home page okay and the last thing i need to do is make sure that when i click the button um it actually makes the popup happen so that one is going to be really freaking simple just one line on click sign in with popup and we're going to give it auth and we're going to get give it the google provider and that's it sign in with popup so let's go sign in with google our popup opened up and now we're getting a different error okay so auth slash configuration not found so this error is happening because we didn't actually configure google so let's go back to our home and let's go to authentication here on the left hand side okay hit get started and on your additional providers simply select google and hit enable okay and support email sure let's go save okay it saved it beautiful so that part is now good to go so let's go back let's go to our app let's now refresh let's hit sign in with google and look at that you guys our google popup is opening up let's go hit quasi at cleverprogrammer.com and let's see if it redirects us to the home page yo and it does guys we did this in the first try look at that super freaking simple and so clean yes very helpful with use effect that's right awesome nice looks like you guys enjoyed that one i did too so that's it guys sign in with google authentication fully complete look the styling part was the one that we wrote a lot of lines of code on but look at the google login part boom that sign in with google on detect the state being changed push them to the home page that's it very very simple okay so we're now good with this and now what we need to do guys is we've added in the sign in ability now we need to add the sign out ability perfect dropping in the comments coming through that's awesome uh when you sign in with google can the app fetch the user's name for other functions damn uh dummy lola exactly you're right on the money so once we sign with google we get the user's information and we populate this and the photo from that so you're on to something good job sign out sign up that's right yes and looks like you guys really enjoyed that part so that's good that makes me really happy um crypto says i sound like a robot damn i mean i i i sure hope i don't but let's let's uh keep going uh let's see so let me hit refresh here cool so uh if i had if i hit my photo what i wanted to do is i wanted to send me back i wanted to send me back to the home page and also sign me out so that's the thing that we're gonna start working on let's go to our index page cool and let's not only get use effect but also get use state because we're going to need to manage the state and then we're going to need access to a couple of more things let's get auth from our firebase app that we made let's also import on auth state changed and sign out so this sign out will be coming from firebase slash auth so now we have access to sign out function and on auth state change function and we'll get access to the use router so we can navigate and go back a page cool so we got all these three things now let's create the user and in the start the user will be null all right and then i'm going to go and do initialize my router and now we'll use our use effect hook all right and then here i'm just going to say return and we'll do on odd state change so this is a on so this is a listener for whether the user is logged in or not that's what this is doing and we're going to say hey if the user is logged in then just set the user to the following user.display name so this guys will be getting the exact so let me show you something when you run this on not state changed this is a firebase function this user over here will be a firebase slash google user so it'll actually get your google user using this so it means it has access to properties like display name it'll be able to display the name of the user it'll be able to display their email it'll be able to display their access token and their profile picture so this user has access to all that information okay let's go name and we'll go photo url go user.photo url just like that okay and um and then what we're gonna say is else set user to empty meaning that's the meaning the user is not there essentially you've logged out at that point and then also push to log in okay so this is going to detect any state changes meaning when you log in or when you log out or whatever happens so when it detects the state change it's going to go inside of this if else condition so if it detects a state change where the user still exists then it's just going to set the user with the following properties if uh if the user does not exist else okay it's going to set the user to null and it's going to send you back to the login page cool and uh this thing that i'm doing here um is is is a nice way to you know for for those of you who are maybe a little bit more advanced this is a nice way to not have to do const unsubscribe and then return unsubscribe at the bottom i find this to be a nicer pattern than that okay so now this name needs to be pulled from the actual user and we have it hard coded here so we need to change this so let's go ahead and remove rafikaze from here and i'm simply going to say if the user exists then show me their username and i'm also going to say if the user exists show me their user.photo url just like that and there you go guys my actual photo is coming from firebase and my actual name display name is coming from firebase as well so hopefully you guys thought that that's or you guys think that that's pretty cool yep yep yep yep yep anthony loves it anthony says sick yeah so super nice i love how cool this is man i like it uh maybe i can see more of you guys here if i put it like a little bit like that okay cool i'm just gonna leave that here okay so we're good with this now all we need to do is make sure our sign out works as well so on this user image we're also going to go on click and i'm going to make an anonymous function and this function is going to say sign out yeah and give it off okay and end this just like this so now when i click this this is going to sign me out all right and the last thing i want to do is for this user image when i hover over it it doesn't look like it's a button or something clickable so we're gonna go to our user image down here and how are we gonna let me ask you guys this how will i do it where i hover over it and i'll make it look like it's a cursor the code goes that's amazing peter says nice craig goes that's that is far yes awesome anthony good job anthony good job lm nice so yes we're going to say cursor pointer all right now when i hover over it boom cursor pointer awesome job dakota nice and uh there we go and now let's hit it let's watch what happens boom i just signed out you guys let's hit sign in with google popup happens let's go kazuya clever click into it and it signs me in it pulls my profile photo profile uh my display name pulls my profile photo so guys sign in and sign out is now complete the back button that we wanted to add is now complete the fare that we wanted to add is now complete so with that said unless i'm wrong david are we done with the app yo that is sick so there we go guys we are done with the uber bill let's go yo that is awesome guys so we we got the whole thing done right santa monica uh let's type that in let's go los angeles let's go confirm locations the thing pops up let's pretend that that doesn't exist uh i got my point a to point b i can scroll down it's calculating my price right it's telling me which cars are available uh and then i can hit the back button back button i can sign out right i can refresh i can sign in with google so there you go that's what i'm talking about boom look at that i'm i'm showing you guys this chat now on the screen kiss liz clapping militia ater says marvelous sean yes super marvelous so awesome to learn and get the clone done with all that functionality and so little time absolutely peter i would love to see route mapping on app but otherwise it looks done yes um yes frankfurt to germany will definitely cost a lot what about payment details let's go just from east coast to west coast is around 2k yes so yeah guys that's what we have for you i hope that you guys have enjoyed the build so far this should essentially complete the entire build for you guys now if you guys want to take this to the next level add more things to this right make it make it go make it go to the next step let's see if we have that keynote open let me close that keynote uh amana do you want to link me the keynote again see do we have it available i don't know if a monarch is still here ah awesome let's try it and i just want to see there we go awesome guys so who's ready for some homework you all ready for some homework you all have been doing homework for the last two days anthony says i'm ready yeah dakota says ready desmond says ready okay okay let's go let's go uh so here we go okay here's the homework so here's the homework for day four make sure you guys finish the uber clone and add your own touch to it so what does that mean adding your own touch to it some of you are maybe advanced you might add stripe to it some of you might want to add dark mode to it some of you might just want to finish it off and maybe if you want to add in some additional functionality you can it's totally up to you but even if you just get it done that's really freaking good okay after that submit your project to the air table and fill out the survey okay and then what time are we showing up tomorrow guys for the front end or for your roadmap to becoming a frontend developer in 90 days five freaking p.m and who's showing up to that day look we worked our asses off for you guys and made sure you guys got something awesome now i wanna know who's showing up for day five yes i'll show up i'll be there i might i'll be there let's go let's go let's go yo that's awesome so tomorrow guys is going to be one of the most valuable days okay just because your app got done doesn't mean that that's end all be all tomorrow honestly is probably going to be one of the most important most valuable days because tomorrow we're going to give you exact week by week plan of how you can become a frontend developer and even if you just left that training after that you will have a full plan of exactly what you need to do every single week so by either week seven or week 12 you could actually be and if you followed and work hard you could actually be applying to frontend developer jobs does that sound good guys yes beautiful so it's it's really going to be super detailed and we're going to give you guys everything on a platter so you can make sure that you just follow and do the work and it's going to put you in a place to get some amazing results okay and with that said tomorrow we'll also be announcing something absolutely incredible something we've been working on for a while and i just can't wait but if you wanna see it if you wanna know what we're talking about uh you're gonna have to show up tomorrow to find that out okay so what i wanna do at this point for you guys is a couple of things we're done with the build okay you you now can take it and take it to the next level so what i want to do right now a few things first of all make sure you guys have your alarm set up for 5 pm tomorrow so you don't miss out okay 4 30 5 p.m whatever set those up and let me know that you've done that so i know you're good to come tomorrow while i'm gonna take a sip of my perrier so my throat can get some relaxation i just realized it sounded awful yo chris is enjoying his vacation uh elon musk coming nice yeah does that roadmap also help ready to be a freelancer yep i need a vacation that's my date beautiful see you tomorrow yup okay awesome so now here's what we're gonna do for those of you who are here right now guys uh let's get into some questions so i'll take some of your guys's questions i'll i'll probably take questions for maybe five to seven minutes i don't want to take too long on the questions because i want to give you more time so you guys can finish off this project are you guys by the way like staying up on most of the days and and and doing the projects like what's what's uh your guys's schedule looking like all right we got some questions coming up so uh do you want to help out here amanath or david please and make sure to put them in spotlight as well so everybody can see it i'm keeping all right um so i i forgot to ask this earlier but i was trying to get my uh webs my project from yesterday up on traversal and i was getting npm errors but everything worked fine on my local machine whenever i did the uh live so the one hack that we found to get it pushed to so we'll show you uh don't know if it'll work for you or not but i think one of the things that we saw to do that is you literally just had to take this data right this data folder take it out from pages and put it at the global level and then okay and then in your ride selector where you're referencing your data just make sure that um you know it's actually going out and uh accessing that data correctly like this all right i'll do that and see if that fixes it thank you yeah you got it so for those of you are not deploying it you don't have to worry too much about what i just did here i'll go and even unchange um the changes that i just made uh where where did it go where's data where like the data go do you guys see it did you relate it by agent it's gone yeah what happened dude gone gone um okay oh wait wait it's it's there it's uh it's there i undid it that's fine okay cool so yeah that's good and then um and then yeah and then if everybody wants i can push this to commit okay i'm just gonna put in okay so it should be good to go for everybody and and i think david for everybody they should just be able to pull off the main branch right if they want that's correct okay yeah cool so we can give them uh a public repo of this so i don't know if this one is a public one or not let's give them a public one okay okay awesome so let's get out of this i'll stop screen sharing all right amazing having the rest of today yep usually say i've got most of my okay so more questions damilola let's take damilola hi hey you can hear me yes sir i can hear you hi uh um my question is just this because right after this tutorial i'm going to help um build the app for my job and um we use like microsoft suites so i was just wondering is it like a firebase version but for like office 365 and microsoft products um microsoft version for firebase there is something like that uh i can't remember the name is it isn't it like net isn't the net suite like microsoft stuff cloud azure does azure have it azure has it right something okay okay yeah yeah yeah that's the microsoft version of aws and firebase okay all right appreciate that yeah yeah there you go um awesome let's take on any more questions we have you guys can also ask questions in the chat i'll just be rapid fire taking them or maybe going deep into it we'll see okay anybody else uh now vr see you tomorrow make sure you finish the project thank you okay you got it brother um is there an extension that autofills like yours and vs code yes i have the most boss extension on planet earth it's it's so sick but you will need to kind of get lucky to access it it's called github copilot not lucky but like they have a wait list it's kind of weird but sign up for github copilot you'll have to sign up maybe on their website and once they allow you to go through you'll get approved and then you'll be able to get it and it's just it's the freaking best um hello hi hi um so i'm going to build um can we use like can we go through like i know you can use different components for other apps uh can we use the firebase as an example for yes yeah absolutely because the things that you used uh are timeless so like for example we set up firebase that's pretty much how you can set up firebase in most of your projects okay yeah the only thing that might change is depending on the type of project you're doing you might want to use a database so you might also will need access a database and stuff like that so now you'll need to add but in terms of the setup yeah it could be like this every single time so you could just use this project as a template for any new projects you do um doesn't use a database uber yeah we're not using a database for this one why not because right now for the uber clone that we did we're not storing any information anywhere oh okay yeah so like if we were to store information then we yeah then we would use it okay thank you yeah you got it um adries i'm so sorry i'm late it's all good we're happy you're here okay the recording will be there for you so make sure you get all caught up on that is it possible to create a i should do like community sessions with you guys honestly where we just code on the regular on over zoom but it'll be like way more beginner and designed to your guys's level um i don't know if you guys are down with that or if that sounds like a good idea but i'd love to do something where it's just like very like this is still like intermediate it gets advanced at times right like really beginner level stuff i think um iman is okay amani would be down okay cool awesome awesome um oh by the way guys i just a reminder we you i don't know if you guys remember but i did let you guys know that we have uh what's it called uh we have the uber challenge or sorry the react intensive coming up 19th to 21st so i know a couple of you guys reached out to me and we have now we're up to four spots four to five spots booked okay so we'll only have a couple of spots left for that so if you guys are interested it's on the 19th to 21st it'll be here before you know it and pretty soon we'll be letting our entire audience know about it outside of this challenge so get books if you're interested let me know or just send me a message here on zoom just drop it down here and then we can have our team follow up with you okay let's see other questions so drop your questions either in the chat or jump on and we'll help you oh the react intensive is a threeday event it's going to be extremely intense it's 30 hours of training in three days so it's eight to ten hours of training every single day each day you're going to be building a project by the end you'll have two to three projects fully completed on your portfolio and because we have so much more time and the complexity of the projects is not going to be like this uber level thing so it's going to be way more understandable i think for most of you and intermediates and yeah i mean what we saw last time we did it just skyrocketed people's skills so if you're considering it i would highly look into that um cool yeah one number yeah so yeah you guys can actually text me right over here uh david right yeah can you report 6657 just making two to four what is it six five six yes so sean yeah yeah yeah okay so shoot me a text there guys and just say something like reaction just say hashtag intensive and uh two two four yeah i can put the number here as well so it's easy for everybody to see um let's go like this so it's one two two four six five one eight eight one seven and then you can just say uh hashtag intensive okay and you know either i or somebody will get in touch with you i'll personally reply to all of these messages and then we'll get on um and then we'll see if this is something you're interested in or or not okay so we can let you know of all the information you need there all right coming back to you guys let's go here stop sharing cool okay awesome uh at what time the react intensive is gonna be november 19th or 21st it's gonna be happening we'll have to get the the time down so don't quote me on this but it's gonna be around 10 a.m ish we we say that because sometimes uh you know depending on who we get we will schedule it around your guys schedule so right now we're maxing it out at um it out at about 10 to 15 people we're not taking any more people than that because we want to have a small group of people and then work with you over 2030 hours okay cool other questions what is copilot copilot is it will auto complete things for you in a really intelligent way i mean it's it's ridiculous at times it writes code for me it's it's freaky it is like take auto completion and just like put it on steroids and make it a human that's really smart and knows what you're going to do at lightning speed you just hit tab and things autocomplete it's pretty freaking awesome okay one more question why doesn't amazon close use db is it because you have to choose specific items so why we have a database for the amazon clone why do we what are we storing in there actually i'm trying to remember i actually do we have a database though i don't think we do no we don't we didn't use a database yeah i don't remember using use firebase just to store the documents but documents we didn't use like a postgres my sequel because they did use firestore yeah wait wait so what did we use firestore for in amazon so install the document no no i i no okay so david what like what documents what was in the documents that we were storing the products that uh that were showing up on the screen ah so we're like using redux to store and firebase okay interesting so yeah so it's like basically you can store the oh oh okay okay okay okay no no no so redux was for cart items and then the products yes yes yes the products are showing up on the screen albert they were coming from the database so that's the difference okay so albert for example this uber app that we built right you guys know how we did that listing with uh you guys know how we did that like car list and we just created this dummy file and we have this folder called data that should normally be on a database so you can put that on a database we just wanted to simplify it for you guys and scope it down to something smaller but if you guys want for bonus points you could take your car list and put it in firebase database which is called firestore and then pull the data from there cool all right how to apply for react so lm so send a text yeah okay so you got the answer to that yes send the text message yes okay uhhuh eduardo send a text message not a uh zoom chat and a text message to the phone number that we provided and then we'll be able to help so like leela sent a text message i see yours bushra i think bushra did edna did vishal did dakota did sharon did yeah okay what is the exact name of the copal extension that you use i literally think it's called github copilot that's it i don't think there is anything else outside of it all right uh i'll take questions for two more minutes so any questions if you guys want to jump on you you're welcome to jump on just raise your hands we'll be able to bring you on or drop your questions in the chat thank you for con for another donation by the way that is absolutely incredible thank you uh cryptoanarchist says you are a blockchain engineer on youtube that's incredible uh what i think hold on uh crypto anarchist text me where i just dropped the number in youtube chat text me there i'd love to chat with you because that's that's incredible we're actually trying to help other students become blockchain engineers as well so that's super cool love to talk to you about that is it possible to create a hosted live website and have an admin that uploads new items into the website like buy this new item albert absolutely so you can make things with react and then you can even like build admin dashboards which allows admins to easily add in products and things like that what i recommend you do is um essentially for admins you want them to be able to point and click and do things and you don't want to spend too much time coding that side up so what i'd recommend is look into something called sanity.io and what that is is it allows you to be able to let's see here okay let's see if i can just pull it up for you guys so um okay um i'm not sharing my screen right now right am i sharing my screen no you're not okay so let's go sanity io and then click it okay there we go and i'll share my screen with you guys boom so here's sanity i o okay and these are all like content management platforms so they're called like cms okay it's called uh they're cmss and they make oh did they just make like things very point and clicky so if you have admin they can easily add things to your react app you'll just have to connect sanity with react and then essentially for admins and things like that will give them point and click functionality to add in data remove data add a blog post write a blog post and it already looks nice and all of that and that's managed by sanity so look into that like for example like this so you'll just be able to add a title an image add a product hit publish and then from your react app you can just pull the data from sanity and display it okay so that's what i would recommend honestly it's like the best experience it's fast you'll not have to spend years coding it up you know westboss recommends it too so i would mix it up with your projects um yeah so definitely give give sanity a try out and then there's this girl on youtube that keeps that makes a lot of sanity i o like tutorials would react i forget her name um i think she lives in hawaii or something she always starts it off with aloha but she's good so watch her watch her stuff it'll help you okay let's see okay that was a good question by the way apollo pulse chain is going to be awesome what's paul's chain pulse chain the launch of pulse chain looks phenomenal actually looks really cool here we go energy efficient cheaper faster fee burning ethereum fork wow the pulse chain sacrifice phase raised millions of dollars support descends dot org medical reserves the sacrifice phase is over do not sacrifice any more money wow we raised 25 million dollars for medical so far you must follow the okay what is this though um i guess it's some technology with ethereum that makes the gas fee free or something i don't know i don't or maybe cheaper so that would be pretty cool because i know for uh most of this ethereum and bitcoin stuff the gas fees kind of get out of control but let's get back to coding let's not jump too much into the nft bitcoin world okay awesome all right last minute any questions concerns anything you all want to bring up want to jump on talk to me about something last minute 50 seconds 40 seconds dakota hey kazi oh who who's going right now my bad that's chris it's craig uh okay let's bring craig on just
