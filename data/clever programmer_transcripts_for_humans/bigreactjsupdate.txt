00:00 - react has updated their dogs what
00:03 - they've finally decided to stop using
00:05 - the ugly classes and now everything is
00:08 - written with functional components and
00:10 - hooks here they're even giving a very
00:11 - nice example of creating an array of
00:13 - products then creating a functional
00:15 - component called shopping list and then
00:17 - they just iterate through those products
00:20 - and turn them into list items and
00:22 - they're even showing you the result of
00:23 - that there's another beautiful example
00:25 - they're showing of creating a button
00:26 - with a handle click function so once you
00:29 - click the button it actually tells you
00:30 - you clicked me now see even how easy it
00:33 - is to add a counter to that button by
00:35 - using functional components this looks
00:37 - so much simpler I can now click these
00:39 - buttons and it'll actually count for me
00:42 - interactively right on the docs so at
00:44 - this point even if you're a complete
00:45 - beginner react docs is one of the best
00:47 - places for you to learn to code
