00:21 - How long does it actually take
00:24 - to become a software developer?
00:26 - And how long does it take
00:28 - to actually get your first job?
00:30 - Today I have a comment for you
00:32 - that will actually answer
all of those questions
00:35 - and more, so without any further ado
00:38 - let's jump right into it.
00:41 - This is Qazi, also known as Papa Python
00:44 - from cleverprogrammer.com.
00:48 - Now today I'm gonna read
to you that comment,
00:51 - but first of all I do wanna say
00:52 - this is day seven of the
challenge that I've been doing,
00:56 - and this is also video
seven so I'm committed
00:59 - to making one video every
day for the next 30 days.
01:03 - Now, as a motivation for you and some
01:05 - accountability for you, I am doing that
01:07 - and letting you know.
01:08 - So if you wanna use this time to code
01:10 - for 30 days in a row, you
may do so alongside me
01:14 - and you can tag me in stuff
too on Instagram posts
01:17 - and I will reply to you.
01:18 - I'm really active on
Instagram so my Instagram
01:20 - is right here, cleverqazi.
01:22 - Go to my Instagram, add me,
and then you can actually
01:26 - tag me in your posts where
you're coding every day
01:28 - for let's say 20 minutes,
10 minutes, 30 minutes,
01:31 - whatever it may be, all right.
01:33 - So let's jump into this video.
01:35 - I'm gonna read to you this comment now.
01:37 - This comment was made on one of my videos
01:40 - and that video was called
How I Learned to Code
01:43 - in Less Than 2 Months.
01:46 - Really amazing video, go check it out.
01:47 - So Jon Story says, "Today was my first day
01:51 - as a developer slash
programmer slash designer
01:54 - "however you wanna call it
01:56 - "and this video gave me the
courage and the strength
02:00 - "to start a new career as
a self-taught developer.
02:03 - "And I just wanna say thank
you for the inspiration,
02:06 - "it's been a long journey,
02:08 - "it took me almost two years,
02:10 - "not two months, to get to this point.
02:13 - "I started around June or July 2017,
02:17 - and today, January 28th, 2019
02:20 - was my very first day of my
first job in the industry.
02:24 - "Just like Les Brown says,
"One idea can change your life,
02:31 - ""One idea can turn your
entire life around."
02:34 - "I come to the same video
where everything started.
02:37 - "Thank you, Clever Programmer,
for the inspiration."
02:41 - So this was a pretty monumental moment,
02:44 - and it was a really
incredible comment to actually
02:47 - have the privilege to read,
02:48 - and I'm gonna be honest,
like, when I was actually
02:51 - walking around and I got
it, I was somewhere outside,
02:54 - I saw this comment and it
brought tears to my eyes.
02:57 - I almost wanted to like, cry,
02:59 - I got really teary-eyed and
I messaged everybody I knew,
03:01 - I made a post on Instagram and everything
03:03 - and then I sent him a reply as well.
03:06 - I just thought it was
so inspiring that he'd
03:08 - came a full circle.
03:09 - The video where he started, that gave him
03:12 - that inspiration to
actually become a developer,
03:14 - he came back to that video to
actually leave that comment.
03:16 - It was really remarkable
03:18 - and for me it was like,
if my YouTube channel
03:21 - had any purpose, like
that alone for example
03:24 - could be worth it.
03:25 - Even though we have so many people
03:26 - who have similar stories
where they become a developer,
03:29 - but even if I could help one person
03:30 - even be inspired to do that
and go on that journey,
03:34 - it's like my job is complete.
03:36 - All the blood, sweat, and time and effort
03:39 - I've put into building Clever Programmer
03:40 - is completely worth it.
03:42 - So that was an amazing moment.
03:44 - Now what do you get out of that comment?
03:47 - That video I made, I pushed for
03:48 - that you could actually
become a software developer
03:50 - in two months, you can
become a software developer
03:51 - in three months.
03:53 - And I learned actually code in two months
03:56 - but in the case of Jon
03:58 - it took two years,
04:01 - actually two years,
04:03 - maybe just a little
bit less than two years
04:05 - to really, actually get his first job.
04:07 - For everybody it's gonna take a different
04:09 - amount of time, all right?
04:12 - And now it also has to
do with how much time
04:14 - are you actually able to put in?
04:17 - Most people realistically
04:19 - are able to put in a few hours a day,
04:22 - maybe a few hours a week
04:24 - because they have prior commitments,
04:27 - different responsibilities,
some of you might have
04:30 - kids, jobs, bills to pay,
04:33 - things of that nature.
04:34 - For me to actually get my
first freelancing client
04:38 - in as little as three months
and I share that story,
04:41 - it's because I also had
no life at that time.
04:45 - I mean, I did, but I also didn't, right?
04:47 - So you have to understand
that I personally
04:49 - was living with my parents at the time,
04:53 - I had lots of support,
04:54 - I had a financial safety net,
04:57 - I didn't have kids to take care of.
04:59 - I mean, I was still going to college
05:00 - and I was still working a lot,
05:03 - and I had to create
time and I still managed
05:05 - my time really well and I was productive,
05:07 - but there were many, many, many, many days
05:10 - where for example, when
I wasn't going to college
05:12 - or I had a little bit of break
05:14 - I had the luxury to spend 15
to 18 hours a day to code.
05:19 - So when I shared those thoughts about
05:21 - you can become a software
developer in three months
05:23 - or two months, or you can at least
05:25 - get your first job in that time,
05:27 - I feel people take it the wrong way.
05:29 - And I think what they understand from that
05:31 - is that it's actually really
easy to become a developer
05:33 - and he's saying that you
could do it overnight.
05:35 - And that's actually not
what I'm trying to tell you.
05:38 - What I'm trying to tell
you is becoming a developer
05:41 - is very hard.
05:43 - If you are looking to do this
just as your side income,
05:46 - don't do it, because it's
gonna be really difficult to--
05:50 - like there are many
other ways you could earn
05:52 - a side income that are much easier.
05:54 - Like for example, look up drop shipping
05:56 - and learn how to use Amazon for that.
05:59 - Or use Uber or Lyft
06:02 - and it'll be much easier
to actually get a job
06:05 - and start making side income.
06:07 - But get into this field if
you're fascinated by it,
06:10 - if you find it interesting,
and if you feel
06:12 - inspired by it, if this is something
06:14 - you can see yourself doing every day.
06:16 - With that said, if you
are spending one hour
06:18 - or two hours a day it's
gonna take you a long time
06:21 - and for most people, in Jon's story,
06:23 - it will take two years.
06:26 - So the majority of you by default,
06:28 - statistically speaking, it will take you
06:31 - two years or longer to
become a software developer.
06:34 - It's a long, arduous journey.
06:36 - It's exciting and it's
amazing, it's beautiful.
06:40 - Like you could tell,
when he got his first job
06:42 - like it made everything worth it for him.
06:44 - But it is a long path.
06:47 - But if you are able to
compress those hours
06:50 - instead of spending them one hour a week
06:52 - or two hours or three hours a week,
06:54 - or just one hour a day.
06:55 - If you're able to compress that timeline
06:58 - and just put in a lot more grind time
07:00 - it is very possible for you to achieve
07:02 - lots of those goals earlier on, okay.
07:05 - So this is why I push freelancing
07:08 - 'cause the barrier of entry is lower
07:10 - and I was able to start earning an income
07:13 - three to five months into
my programming career.
07:18 - I also became really good in that time
07:20 - and again, the reason was 15
to 18 hours a day of coding.
07:24 - So it makes me a statistical anomaly,
07:28 - but my obsession is crazy.
07:30 - The same thing I did
when it came to chess.
07:33 - When I was learning how to play chess,
07:35 - it takes people an average of 10 years
07:38 - to hit the USCF rating of 2,000.
07:41 - It took me about three years,
07:43 - three and a half years
to actually do that.
07:45 - What happened is that
there wasn't any like
07:49 - weird secret that I did,
07:51 - I just had put in a lot of time
07:53 - and energy into it because I loved it
07:56 - and I was just obsessed by it.
07:57 - Your timeline could look
08:00 - to give you a realistic idea
08:02 - from three months, rare.
08:04 - Three months you can get your first
08:06 - freelancing opportunity,
I wouldn't even say
08:08 - full-time job.
08:09 - Maybe you could get an internship
08:10 - if you have a lot of connections, right,
08:12 - but you have to push yourself
08:13 - and it is possible.
08:14 - But I wanna give you like
more statistical facts
08:17 - in this video.
08:18 - So three months.
08:19 - You have the timeline between three months
08:20 - to two to 2.5 years
08:23 - where you could become a developer
08:25 - and you could get a job, all right.
08:26 - This is a very realistic,
08:28 - I hate that word, realistic,
but I know a lot of people
08:31 - want to know what's realistic
08:33 - because they can only do realistic things
08:35 - 'specially with their times
and responsibilities, so.
08:38 - Between three months being very aggressive
08:42 - and then 2.5 years
08:44 - 'cause that's plenty of time.
08:46 - You have that window of
becoming a software developer.
08:49 - With that said, I also wanna tell you
08:51 - that you should pick your language
08:53 - and what you're gonna be specializing in
08:55 - because you wanna kinda see
08:58 - what's gonna be happening two and 2.5
09:00 - years later, and if you
look at the predictions
09:03 - and the way different languages grow
09:05 - it's gonna be a very
major determining factor
09:08 - in what language you should go for.
09:10 - I mean, even though languages
aren't that important,
09:15 - the ideas and what you do with them
09:16 - is more important.
09:17 - For example, if you pick C++, C#
09:20 - then you might get better
at lots of the things
09:25 - that you do with that language.
09:26 - Like, for example, let's
say you pick up Swift
09:28 - and you start learning
mobile development, right?
09:30 - Swift is more predisposed
towards mobile development.
09:36 - If you might spend a lot of time there
09:37 - and then later you're like
09:38 - I wanna become a web developer,
09:39 - you will need to spend a
little bit of extra time
09:42 - to then learn the web development skills.
09:44 - Instead of picking
something like JavaScript,
09:47 - let's say, right in the
start of your journey
09:50 - where you not only learn it
09:51 - but then you're improving the skill set.
09:53 - So by the time,
09:54 - whether it's six months, one year,
09:56 - two years for you, you have this skill set
09:59 - of being a web developer, right.
10:01 - Because JavaScript is
just more predisposed
10:04 - towards web development.
10:05 - You're obviously gonna need
to learn other languages
10:08 - as you're improving,
10:09 - that's just a natural process,
10:11 - but I'm just saying which language
10:12 - you should kind of push towards
10:14 - a little bit in the start.
10:16 - I personally love Python,
10:17 - this whole channel I
always talk about Python
10:20 - so I'm obviously gonna recommend Python
10:22 - to start off with.
10:24 - And even when you look at the trends
10:26 - and the 2019 predictions
and the upcoming years.
10:29 - So let's say if you're
starting your journey now,
10:31 - and you're kind of a beginner,
10:33 - might take you 1.5 to two years
10:35 - to become a developer
10:35 - if you follow the realistic timeline.
10:38 - In that journey, if you're doing Python
10:40 - web development or Python
development in general,
10:43 - just understand that the trend for Python
10:47 - is going really, really high up.
10:49 - And 'specially with machine learning
10:51 - and lots of data visualization
and data analysis,
10:55 - Python is killing it in that regard.
10:57 - And those things are gonna
be very, very important
10:59 - for AI in the upcoming years.
11:01 - You can expect Python to continuously just
11:04 - be growing at a tremendous rate.
11:07 - I mean, it was Googled more
than Kim Kardashian in 2018.
11:10 - Know what I'm saying?
11:12 - All right, so with that said,
11:14 - I will say have that timeline,
11:16 - have that timeframe so you
understand what is going on.
11:20 - To compress it, put in lots of hours
11:22 - and have a solid game plan
11:24 - of what you wanna be doing.
11:25 - Instead of haphazardly just picking
11:29 - random tutorials to learn from,
11:31 - actually be building projects.
11:33 - And if you are building projects
11:35 - and you're working on a
few long-term projects
11:38 - and as you learn new concepts
11:39 - you keep adding them into your projects,
11:41 - you keep taking those projects
11:43 - and putting them up on your GitHub
11:45 - where recruiters and people can see it.
11:48 - If you're focusing on your LinkedIn,
11:50 - your online presence, and your resume,
11:53 - and you constantly have all these ways
11:55 - of getting people's eyes on your project,
11:58 - you can keep compressing that timeline
12:00 - from two years to earlier
and earlier and earlier.
12:04 - Another thing I always talk about
12:05 - is also being able to
build those relationships
12:08 - and going to local events,
12:10 - local meetups where you could have access
12:13 - to internships and job opportunities
12:15 - long before you actually ever need them.
12:20 - And by the time you're even remotely ready
12:22 - you have people who you've
built relationships with
12:25 - who will think this person is perfect,
12:27 - I can bring this person, train them,
12:29 - I've seen their hard work,
12:30 - I've seen their dedication,
12:31 - I've seen that they love coding
12:33 - and they've been consistent,
12:35 - let me bring this person in.
12:36 - I can just teach him.
12:37 - Let's say you're doing Python
12:38 - and they're have a job
opportunity for let's say Java
12:41 - or JavaScript or something
in web development,
12:43 - they'll just bring you on
and teach you that, right.
12:46 - They know where your skill set is,
12:48 - they know how long it'll
take to show you that.
12:50 - They also know you're reliable.
12:51 - So you might actually
get a job or internship
12:54 - or freelancing opportunity
just a few months
12:57 - into your career.
12:59 - I hope this gives you an idea
13:01 - and I hope I have provided
you with a few tips.
13:03 - I suggest you go back to the part
13:05 - where I gave a few tips
and just write them down
13:07 - 'cause they are very powerful.
13:10 - And I do wanna let you know
13:11 - I have a program coming out very soon
13:14 - in probably a week or two.
13:16 - It's gonna be called Earn 1K With Python
13:19 - and the idea behind that
program is to show you
13:22 - the eight steps that I used
13:24 - to become a software developer
13:26 - and get my first job in
less than four months.
13:31 - In less than three months, all right.
13:33 - Right around that timeline
13:34 - I got my freelancing opportunity,
13:36 - and that's where my
career started taking off.
13:39 - I'm gonna just distill all these points,
13:41 - give it to you in a very simple,
13:43 - easy to understand fashion.
13:45 - And this course is all about
13:47 - transformation, not information.
13:50 - There's gonna be more stuff for you to do
13:52 - but it's gonna be very results-oriented
13:55 - and each week we build on
13:57 - so that you can then
have a strong foundation
14:00 - to become a high income-earning
software developer.
14:03 - Whether that's $60,000 for you or $70,000
14:06 - but my goal is to give you
a very strong foundation
14:08 - to be going towards that six-figure mark.
14:11 - And with this program, my hope for you
14:14 - is to earn your first $1,000 with Python
14:19 - and then hopefully that'll
give you enough momentum
14:21 - to keep going and growing a lot faster.
14:25 - Thank you so much for watching this video.
14:27 - I love your face,
14:29 - and if you wanna get emails
about my upcoming course
14:31 - which is gonna be coming soon,
14:33 - and you want to have access to this epic
14:36 - three-part masterclass
I've put together as well,
14:39 - then go to cleverprogrammer.com.
14:41 - I've put the link in the
description below as well,
14:43 - just click there and pop in your email.
14:47 - That way when my course comes out
14:49 - I'll let you know, and
I'll also give you access
14:51 - to my epic three-part masterclass.
14:53 - That's it for this video,
14:54 - thank you so much for watching.
14:56 - I love your beautiful face
14:58 - and as always I'll see you
15:01 - in the next video.

And how long does it take to actually get your first job? Today I have a comment for you that will actually answer all of those questions and more, so without any further ado let's jump right into it. This is Qazi, also known as Papa Python from cleverprogrammer.com. Now today I'm gonna read to you that comment, but first of all I do wanna say this is day seven of the challenge that I've been doing, and this is also video seven so I'm committed to making one video every day for the next 30 days. Now, as a motivation for you and some accountability for you, I am doing that and letting you know. So if you wanna use this time to code for 30 days in a row, you may do so alongside me and you can tag me in stuff too on Instagram posts and I will reply to you. I'm really active on Instagram so my Instagram is right here, cleverqazi. Go to my Instagram, add me, and then you can actually tag me in your posts where you're coding every day for let's say 20 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, whatever it may be, all right. So let's jump into this video. I'm gonna read to you this comment now. This comment was made on one of my videos and that video was called How I Learned to Code in Less Than 2 Months. Really amazing video, go check it out. So Jon Story says, "Today was my first day as a developer slash programmer slash designer "however you wanna call it "and this video gave me the courage and the strength "to start a new career as a selftaught developer. "And I just wanna say thank you for the inspiration, "it's been a long journey, "it took me almost two years, "not two months, to get to this point.

"Just like Les Brown says, "One idea can change your life, ""One idea can turn your entire life around." "I come to the same video where everything started. "Thank you, Clever Programmer, for the inspiration." So this was a pretty monumental moment, and it was a really incredible comment to actually have the privilege to read, and I'm gonna be honest, like, when I was actually walking around and I got it, I was somewhere outside, I saw this comment and it brought tears to my eyes.

That video I made, I pushed for that you could actually become a software developer in two months, you can become a software developer in three months. And I learned actually code in two months but in the case of Jon it took two years, actually two years, maybe just a little bit less than two years to really, actually get his first job. For everybody it's gonna take a different amount of time, all right? And now it also has to do with how much time are you actually able to put in?

If you are looking to do this just as your side income, don't do it, because it's gonna be really difficult to like there are many other ways you could earn a side income that are much easier. Like for example, look up drop shipping and learn how to use Amazon for that. Or use Uber or Lyft and it'll be much easier to actually get a job and start making side income. But get into this field if you're fascinated by it, if you find it interesting, and if you feel inspired by it, if this is something you can see yourself doing every day. With that said, if you are spending one hour or two hours a day it's gonna take you a long time and for most people, in Jon's story, it will take two years. So the majority of you by default, statistically speaking, it will take you two years or longer to become a software developer. It's a long, arduous journey. It's exciting and it's amazing, it's beautiful. Like you could tell, when he got his first job like it made everything worth it for him. But it is a long path. But if you are able to compress those hours instead of spending them one hour a week or two hours or three hours a week, or just one hour a day. If you're able to compress that timeline and just put in a lot more grind time it is very possible for you to achieve lots of those goals earlier on, okay. So this is why I push freelancing 'cause the barrier of entry is lower and I was able to start earning an income three to five months into my programming career. I also became really good in that time and again, the reason was 15 to 18 hours a day of coding. So it makes me a statistical anomaly, but my obsession is crazy. The same thing I did when it came to chess. When I was learning how to play chess, it takes people an average of 10 years to hit the USCF rating of 2,000. It took me about three years, three and a half years to actually do that. What happened is that there wasn't any like weird secret that I did, I just had put in a lot of time and energy into it because I loved it and I was just obsessed by it. Your timeline could look to give you a realistic idea from three months, rare. Three months you can get your first freelancing opportunity, I wouldn't even say fulltime job. Maybe you could get an internship if you have a lot of connections, right, but you have to push yourself and it is possible. But I wanna give you like more statistical facts in this video. So three months. You have the timeline between three months to two to 2.5 years where you could become a developer and you could get a job, all right. This is a very realistic, I hate that word, realistic, but I know a lot of people want to know what's realistic because they can only do realistic things 'specially with their times and responsibilities, so. Between three months being very aggressive and then 2.5 years 'cause that's plenty of time. You have that window of becoming a software developer. With that said, I also wanna tell you that you should pick your language and what you're gonna be specializing in because you wanna kinda see what's gonna be happening two and 2.5 years later, and if you look at the predictions and the way different languages grow it's gonna be a very major determining factor in what language you should go for. I mean, even though languages aren't that important, the ideas and what you do with them is more important. For example, if you pick C++, C# then you might get better at lots of the things that you do with that language. Like, for example, let's say you pick up Swift and you start learning mobile development, right? Swift is more predisposed towards mobile development. If you might spend a lot of time there and then later you're like I wanna become a web developer, you will need to spend a little bit of extra time to then learn the web development skills. Instead of picking something like JavaScript, let's say, right in the start of your journey where you not only learn it but then you're improving the skill set. So by the time, whether it's six months, one year, two years for you, you have this skill set of being a web developer, right. Because JavaScript is just more predisposed towards web development. You're obviously gonna need to learn other languages as you're improving, that's just a natural process, but I'm just saying which language you should kind of push towards a little bit in the start. I personally love Python, this whole channel I always talk about Python so I'm obviously gonna recommend Python to start off with. And even when you look at the trends and the 2019 predictions and the upcoming years. So let's say if you're starting your journey now, and you're kind of a beginner, might take you 1.5 to two years to become a developer if you follow the realistic timeline. In that journey, if you're doing Python web development or Python development in general, just understand that the trend for Python is going really, really high up. And 'specially with machine learning and lots of data visualization and data analysis, Python is killing it in that regard. And those things are gonna be very, very important for AI in the upcoming years. You can expect Python to continuously just be growing at a tremendous rate. I mean, it was Googled more than Kim Kardashian in 2018. Know what I'm saying? All right, so with that said, I will say have that timeline, have that timeframe so you understand what is going on. To compress it, put in lots of hours and have a solid game plan of what you wanna be doing. Instead of haphazardly just picking random tutorials to learn from, actually be building projects. And if you are building projects and you're working on a few longterm projects and as you learn new concepts you keep adding them into your projects, you keep taking those projects and putting them up on your GitHub where recruiters and people can see it. If you're focusing on your LinkedIn, your online presence, and your resume, and you constantly have all these ways of getting people's eyes on your project, you can keep compressing that timeline from two years to earlier and earlier and earlier. Another thing I always talk about is also being able to build those relationships and going to local events, local meetups where you could have access to internships and job opportunities long before you actually ever need them. And by the time you're even remotely ready you have people who you've built relationships with who will think this person is perfect, I can bring this person, train them, I've seen their hard work, I've seen their dedication, I've seen that they love coding and they've been consistent, let me bring this person in. I can just teach him. Let's say you're doing Python and they're have a job opportunity for let's say Java or JavaScript or something in web development, they'll just bring you on and teach you that, right. They know where your skill set is, they know how long it'll take to show you that. They also know you're reliable. So you might actually get a job or internship or freelancing opportunity just a few months into your career. I hope this gives you an idea and I hope I have provided you with a few tips. I suggest you go back to the part where I gave a few tips and just write them down 'cause they are very powerful. And I do wanna let you know I have a program coming out very soon in probably a week or two. It's gonna be called Earn 1K With Python and the idea behind that program is to show you the eight steps that I used to become a software developer and get my first job in less than four months. In less than three months, all right. Right around that timeline I got my freelancing opportunity, and that's where my career started taking off. I'm gonna just distill all these points, give it to you in a very simple, easy to understand fashion. And this course is all about transformation, not information. There's gonna be more stuff for you to do but it's gonna be very resultsoriented and each week we build on so that you can then have a strong foundation to become a high incomeearning software developer. Whether that's $60,000 for you or $70,000 but my goal is to give you a very strong foundation to be going towards that sixfigure mark. And with this program, my hope for you is to earn your first $1,000 with Python and then hopefully that'll give you enough momentum to keep going and growing a lot faster.
