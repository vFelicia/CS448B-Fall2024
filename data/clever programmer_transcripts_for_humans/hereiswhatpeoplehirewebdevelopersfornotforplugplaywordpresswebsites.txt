With timestamps:

00:00 - okay so there are two big frameworks in
00:02 - Python but before we talk about
00:04 - framework let's talk about web
00:07 - development in general okay
00:11 - web development has to do with
00:14 - developing things on the web everything
00:17 - you see online and the main one of the
00:20 - main things I want to kind of touch on
00:21 - is web sites versus web apps okay or
00:26 - basically like solutions to problems
00:29 - so regular web sites I want you to think
00:31 - of like imagine I don't know your
00:35 - regular contact me pages your restaurant
00:38 - web sites that are super boring and just
00:41 - I don't know have like static stuff on
00:44 - it you can't really do much there just
00:46 - go just read their menu that's really it
00:48 - or it maybe has some dudes phone number
00:50 - and you can call them or email somebody
00:52 - that's your static website but those
00:56 - things you can build in WordPress or
01:02 - Squarespace if you guys are not familiar
01:03 - with these open another tab and type
01:07 - this in so you can learn or write these
01:09 - down so you can learn them later you
01:11 - actually don't open other other tabs
01:13 - right now I want you guys to pay
01:15 - attention right here to me and just
01:18 - write this down and then later you can
01:20 - open up other tabs and do this okay so
01:23 - WordPress is basically like a
01:24 - point-and-click build a website
01:26 - Squarespace is a point-and-click build a
01:28 - website thing wakes and Weebly similarly
01:31 - those things people don't pay you a lot
01:35 - for those are commodities you can have
01:38 - 12 year old learn it very quickly and
01:43 - and also a lot of those are outsourced
01:46 - and there are a lot of people that can
01:48 - do them okay so any skill that's easy to
01:50 - do you're not gonna get paid for okay
01:52 - but a skill that takes a lot of time and
01:56 - is difficult you're gonna get paid for
01:59 - it and quite a bit because it's hard to
02:02 - replace you like right now and think
02:05 - about this where you are working how
02:10 - easy do you think it is to replace you
02:11 - if the answer is pretty easy then it
02:16 - probably also makes sense what you're
02:18 - getting paid right so if you think
02:22 - you're getting paid some low income and
02:24 - then you think that it's not that hard
02:27 - to replace you put the two and two
02:30 - together and the reason why you're
02:31 - probably making a lower income is cuz
02:34 - that it's easier to replace you but now
02:37 - as you start to get more specialized and
02:39 - as you learn more skills it's harder to
02:41 - replace you okay so generic websites
02:45 - that you can build with web web
02:47 - WordPress or whatever they're not too
02:49 - hard to do so you don't get paid much
02:53 - for it but the things that you do get
02:54 - paid for is for example and I'm gonna
02:58 - use big company name so it you guys can
03:00 - tie that in your head but most of the
03:03 - times when you're starting out you don't
03:04 - have to work with these big companies
03:06 - you can get started with a lot smaller
03:08 - companies that are under the radar and
03:09 - are trying to get their foot off the
03:12 - ground and get going
03:13 - but with the things that you get paid
03:15 - for is for example like Spotify is a
03:17 - music streaming problem and if you can
03:21 - solve it that's something you can get
03:23 - paid for so that's like a web app how
03:26 - about Domino's right where you can go
03:29 - and it'd be really boring if the pizzas
03:33 - just pictures of them were there and you
03:35 - just had to call them and order
03:37 - something but it's pretty dynamic you
03:40 - have to click on it you can order you
03:42 - can increase your order you can change
03:43 - your order when when you're in their app
03:45 - when you put mushrooms on your pizza you
03:47 - can choose if you want to put half on
03:49 - one side and half on the other you can
03:52 - choose what's your quantity you can
03:54 - delete and you can remove so for all of
03:58 - those things and being able to add that
04:00 - functionality that's a solution to a
04:06 - burning problem and the developers that
04:08 - got hard hired to do that would get paid
04:11 - a lot same thing with snapchat there's a
04:14 - huge networking problem there to fix how
04:17 - do you have all these people in the
04:18 - world sending each other pictures it
04:21 - goes fast it doesn't crash the entire
04:23 - website and they're able to send
04:25 - pictures and videos like instant
04:26 - boom-boom-boom how do you do that
04:29 - without your servers being overloaded
04:32 - right and here's a word I'm gonna give
04:38 - you guys it's called crud so write that
04:41 - now that's one of the things you have to
04:43 - know about as a web developer and be
04:45 - able to do pretty fast
04:48 - crud c ru D in caps crud means read it
04:59 - means create just making sure you guys
05:02 - are paying attention it means create
05:04 - read update and delete okay for things I
05:10 - don't know why I do it like I'm in
05:12 - Germany in United States we do it like
05:15 - this for but I think it's just cooler
05:18 - when I do when I do three like this I
05:20 - think it's really cool so I'm gonna keep
05:21 - doing it but that's what that means okay
05:23 - crud create read update delete write
05:26 - that down next to you on a piece of
05:29 - paper preferably and what that has to do
05:33 - with is I'll give I'll give you examples
05:35 - of where it's applied when you're when
05:38 - you're in dominos app and you're trying
05:40 - to create an order for those of you guys
05:43 - who don't know dominoes dominoes is a
05:44 - company that delivers pizzas this solve
05:47 - the pizza problem okay when you create a
05:52 - order for a pizza that's what part of
05:55 - the crud I'm now gonna quiz you guys
05:59 - when you create the pizza
06:01 - what part of crud do you think that is
06:04 - is it the sea is that the are is it the
06:07 - U or the D okay so that's the create
06:10 - part
06:11 - now what about being able to let's say
06:15 - you put that order but now you want to
06:16 - change that order okay now you want to
06:19 - make that order something different what
06:21 - part of the crud do you think that is
06:24 - when you've already created the order
06:26 - but now before hitting check out you're
06:29 - like I don't want pepperonis on my pizza
06:31 - I just want some green peppers and
06:33 - jalapenos
06:34 - what part of crud is that that's the
06:37 - update part all right
06:39 - and before I go further for those of you
06:41 - guys like what are we doing no web
06:45 - developers get paid a hundred and ten
06:48 - thousand dollars a year and believe it
06:51 - or not this is one of the things that is
06:52 - massively helpful and right now I know
06:55 - I'm having you just like kind of learn
06:56 - it and regurgitate and memorizing it was
06:58 - like oh it doesn't make sense but I
07:00 - promise you right after we're done with
07:03 - this I'm gonna kind of give you examples
07:04 - I'm gonna be giving examples of it and
07:06 - this is this is gonna be one of those
07:07 - things that saves you years of your time
07:10 - and also helps you
07:12 - now it's researchable for you so you can
07:15 - actually look at online tutorials be
07:17 - able to do this and get those jobs I pay
07:19 - you a lot and you don't need years of
07:23 - experience to get these web development
07:24 - jobs like in my PLC - or my video - part
07:29 - two of the master class okay that got
07:31 - launched it's called why most
07:33 - programmers are broke in that one I also
07:36 - share with you what things I was working
07:39 - on and what client paid me twenty
07:42 - thousand one hundred and seventy three
07:43 - dollars and thirty cents for two months
07:46 - of work and it was pretty much just me
07:48 - knowing crud and working on it so now
07:52 - let's continue forward so you guys know
07:55 - you guys have it in your mind why this
07:56 - can be actually really important helpful
07:58 - for you all right now when I am let's
08:03 - say last one let's just do last one and
08:05 - this is so obvious if I don't want my
08:08 - pizza anymore
08:09 - I'm just angry I don't like I just call
08:11 - Domino's service and that lady just
08:14 - didn't have the right attitude she just
08:16 - pissed me off rubbed me the wrong way
08:17 - and I'm like all right all bets are off
08:20 - and I go and I hit X on that order what
08:24 - part of the crud did I just do it's the
08:27 - delete part so if I delete my order I've
08:29 - deleted so again crud create read update
08:33 - and delete okay and lastly I want to
08:37 - give you an example of the read part
08:39 - what if you have ordered your pizza but
08:43 - you don't know what the heck you ordered
08:44 - and then you go click view order what
08:48 - part of crud is that create read update
08:51 - delete what
08:53 - part of the crud is that you being able
08:55 - to go oh what the heck where what what
08:57 - pizza did I order you know clicking that
08:59 - View button best development frameworks
09:02 - in Python there's Django and then
09:05 - there's flask write that down I'm gonna
09:07 - come back to that point okay
09:11 - what we're talking about is the big
09:14 - picture view of web development we're
09:15 - talking about how much Python web
09:17 - developers get paid so according to
09:19 - indeed.com if you look at it right now
09:24 - average django Python developer makes a
09:28 - hundred and ten thousand and six hundred
09:31 - and ten dollars every single year and
09:39 - one of the key concepts their entire job
09:42 - could be summarized in is with one word
09:45 - crud okay so say it with me what the
09:49 - crud I get paid 110 thousand dollars a
09:53 - year for crud what the crud it's crazy
09:59 - so if you've written down crud if you've
10:01 - written down Django if you've written
10:03 - out flask all these things you guys can
10:06 - research later also Python web
10:08 - developers and how much they make you
10:10 - could research later we've talked about
10:15 - WordPress and Squarespace being able to
10:18 - build boring sites but Python can help
10:23 - you build web apps okay that can provide
10:26 - solutions these are not things that you
10:28 - can just do in Squarespace and you know
10:30 - appointment click these are things that
10:32 - you have to use real powerful
10:34 - programming languages for to solve
10:36 - problems things problems with things
10:39 - like Dropbox cloud storage problem
10:41 - solved with Python YouTube video sharing
10:45 - problem solved with Python I've already
10:51 - talked about Spotify reddit a social
10:54 - network for sharing links and threads
10:57 - and I don't even know it's very
10:58 - complicated for me
10:59 - a reddit was a social problem salt with
11:03 - Python Instagram similarly of
11:07 - photo-sharing problem solved with python
11:10 - so you can see that these massive
11:13 - companies are using it Google a search
11:15 - engine problem solved with Python okay
11:17 - so you have to build really custom
11:19 - solutions for it and ultimately again it
11:22 - comes down to crud
11:24 - alright comes down to kind of one thing
11:27 - [Music]
