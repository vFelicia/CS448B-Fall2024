00:04 - gave us on the left hand side so

00:11 - things that you see down here below are
00:13 - like make sure that you have h1 tag that
00:16 - actually says hello world so let's just
00:18 - give that a try right how would we do
00:20 - that see if you can figure out how a way
00:22 - how to do that and by the way this is
00:24 - the first challenge free code camp so if
00:27 - you guys want to try some free code can
00:28 - stuff go ahead and do that so let's say
00:31 - h1 tag right and I do hello world like
00:38 - so I actually don't need to put that in
00:42 - strings I'm too used to Python and then
00:44 - just close that h1 tag right there and
00:46 - then that should be it so that makes our
00:49 - thing look pretty cool let's say run
00:52 - tests and enter it says you have
00:55 - completed it code long and prosper great
00:59 - submit and go to my next challenge so
01:02 - awesome let's try our next challenge now
01:05 - what what are we doing here or the next
01:07 - few challenges we'll build an html5 app
01:09 - that would look something like this
01:10 - that's pretty cool you got your title at
01:13 - the top left top right you got your logo
01:15 - or what not your avatar middle you got a
01:18 - picture

01:27 - box cat your URL and a submit button
01:31 - nice so let's see what they want us to
01:34 - do here create an h2 element so let's
01:38 - add an h2 element and let's change this
01:41 - to h2 let's make this I don't know
01:45 - clever programmer that's our h2 element
01:49 - make sure your h2 has a closing tag it

02:09 - hello world Oh what am i doing I'm going
02:11 - backwards guys h1 hello world let's
02:18 - close that h1 tag this should be good
02:20 - now let's hit run test and enter and it
02:24 - is done all right guys that's it for
02:26 - this video I'll see you in the next
02:28 - video
