00:00 - hey guys how are you doing this is Kazi
00:02 - so in this video I'm going to talk about
00:05 - how to write a very fast and iterative
00:08 - solution to the Fibonacci problem now if
00:12 - you're at a job interview and they don't
00:15 - care whether you write a recursive
00:17 - function or a regular function and they
00:19 - give you okay go ahead and write
00:21 - Fibonacci please don't write it
00:23 - recursively because that is the naive
00:26 - solution of this problem the way you
00:29 - want to write it is the fast iterative
00:31 - way that I'd like to show you now this
00:34 - way is also you know you can see it on
00:36 - Stack Overflow and it's one of the most
00:38 - popular and the best ways to write it so
00:41 - it's very useful if you learn this
00:44 - initially you might have to memorize it
00:46 - but if you practice it enough times
00:48 - you'll start getting the hang of how
00:50 - this solution works so let's get started
00:53 - so I'm going to say I'm gonna define a
00:57 - Fibonacci of n okay
01:00 - and we're gonna say that in the start
01:05 - I'm gonna have some variable called a
01:07 - and B and I'm gonna set their values to
01:09 - 0 and 1 so remember those two values are
01:13 - given right 0 and 1 and then every
01:15 - valley after that is just the sum of the
01:17 - previous two so we're gonna use pythons
01:21 - multiple assignment operation here and
01:23 - the swapping value to you write a very
01:28 - elegant solution
01:29 - it's very pythonic so we're going to use
01:33 - some beautiful Python code and some
01:37 - Python built-in tricks to write this ok
01:40 - so now what I want to do is I want to
01:42 - run my I want to write a for loop that
01:46 - basically keeps adding values keep
01:50 - summing the previous two terms so my
01:52 - code is going to run the same number of
01:54 - times as the term that you're looking
01:56 - for so if you're looking for the fifth
01:58 - term is gonna run five times so here I'm
02:00 - gonna write my loop and I'm going to say
02:04 - is be a comma B is equal to B comma and
02:08 - here's the cool way I'm going
02:11 - show you so let's move this so this
02:14 - takes it makes use of some of pythons
02:17 - built-in elegance you know the
02:19 - assignment operators and the swapping of
02:22 - the values you can't really do this in
02:24 - another language you're gonna need
02:25 - something called a temporary variable if
02:27 - you're using C or Java or something like
02:30 - that so here what I'm effectively saying
02:33 - is B is now the previous term and the
02:37 - new term is the sum of the previous two
02:39 - terms okay so if we wanted to make a run
02:42 - through this we would effectively say
02:48 - okay I come down here B is 1 and a plus
02:52 - B in this case would be 0 plus 1 and you
02:55 - will get 1 okay and that's a third term
03:00 - so this is gonna always be the third
03:02 - term and this is always going to be the
03:05 - second to last term okay so a plus B
03:08 - this is the last last term and this B is
03:11 - the second to last term all right and at
03:15 - the end I'm just gonna say a return a so
03:20 - remember a is what we need to return at
03:24 - the end now I'm gonna run this solution
03:28 - okay okay so now I'm going to run my
03:35 - code here all right so I'm gonna say
03:38 - Python and basics that py oh whoops it's
03:43 - not going to return anything I gotta add
03:45 - a print print statement here I'm gonna
03:47 - say oops Fibonacci of let's say 2
03:59 - all right I got one that's good so let
04:02 - me just write the Fibonacci terms here
04:04 - so you guys can recall how they work and
04:08 - each one is some of the previous to do
04:11 - so here three plus five gives it gives
04:14 - you eight right here zero comma one
04:17 - so here zero plus one gives you one one
04:20 - plus two gives you three two plus three
04:22 - gives you five
04:23 - so each last term is a sum of the
04:25 - previous two and here you're gonna see
04:28 - that my code is gonna work so I'm gonna
04:30 - go and ask for the fifth term what's the
04:32 - fifth term this is the first second
04:34 - I'm sorry zeroth first second third
04:38 - fourth and fifth
04:40 - so fifth should give me five so let's
04:43 - run it and oh I have to save it first
04:47 - almost run it again and I'm getting back
04:49 - five okay and if I said give me the
04:51 - sixth term is gonna give me back eight
04:55 - all right so my code is working here and
05:00 - you can see this is a very simple
05:02 - solution it's very beautiful it's very
05:05 - pythonic and this is the way that you
05:08 - should write this solution when you're
05:10 - at a job interrview UK or if you're
05:12 - applying for programming boot camps or
05:14 - whatnot because a lot of the times
05:17 - you're gonna get a question like this
05:18 - they're gonna try to understand if not
05:21 - only you know how to write functions and
05:24 - algorithms but how efficiently you can
05:26 - write them so the iterative way is the
05:29 - way that I think you should approach
05:30 - this thank you for watching and I'll see
05:32 - you guys in the next video

hey guys how are you doing this is Kazi so in this video I'm going to talk about how to write a very fast and iterative solution to the Fibonacci problem now if you're at a job interview and they don't care whether you write a recursive function or a regular function and they give you okay go ahead and write Fibonacci please don't write it recursively because that is the naive solution of this problem the way you want to write it is the fast iterative way that I'd like to show you now this way is also you know you can see it on Stack Overflow and it's one of the most popular and the best ways to write it so it's very useful if you learn this initially you might have to memorize it but if you practice it enough times you'll start getting the hang of how this solution works so let's get started so I'm going to say I'm gonna define a Fibonacci of n okay and we're gonna say that in the start I'm gonna have some variable called a and B and I'm gonna set their values to 0 and 1 so remember those two values are given right 0 and 1 and then every valley after that is just the sum of the previous two so we're gonna use pythons multiple assignment operation here and the swapping value to you write a very elegant solution it's very pythonic so we're going to use some beautiful Python code and some Python builtin tricks to write this ok so now what I want to do is I want to run my I want to write a for loop that basically keeps adding values keep summing the previous two terms so my code is going to run the same number of times as the term that you're looking for so if you're looking for the fifth term is gonna run five times so here I'm gonna write my loop and I'm going to say is be a comma B is equal to B comma and here's the cool way I'm going show you so let's move this so this takes it makes use of some of pythons builtin elegance you know the assignment operators and the swapping of the values you can't really do this in another language you're gonna need something called a temporary variable if you're using C or Java or something like that so here what I'm effectively saying is B is now the previous term and the new term is the sum of the previous two terms okay so if we wanted to make a run through this we would effectively say okay I come down here B is 1 and a plus B in this case would be 0 plus 1 and you will get 1 okay and that's a third term so this is gonna always be the third term and this is always going to be the second to last term okay so a plus B this is the last last term and this B is the second to last term all right and at the end I'm just gonna say a return a so remember a is what we need to return at the end now I'm gonna run this solution okay okay so now I'm going to run my code here all right so I'm gonna say Python and basics that py oh whoops it's not going to return anything I gotta add a print print statement here I'm gonna say oops Fibonacci of let's say 2 all right I got one that's good so let me just write the Fibonacci terms here so you guys can recall how they work and each one is some of the previous to do so here three plus five gives it gives you eight right here zero comma one so here zero plus one gives you one one plus two gives you three two plus three gives you five so each last term is a sum of the previous two and here you're gonna see that my code is gonna work so I'm gonna go and ask for the fifth term what's the fifth term this is the first second I'm sorry zeroth first second third fourth and fifth so fifth should give me five so let's run it and oh I have to save it first almost run it again and I'm getting back five okay and if I said give me the sixth term is gonna give me back eight all right so my code is working here and you can see this is a very simple solution it's very beautiful it's very pythonic and this is the way that you should write this solution when you're at a job interrview UK or if you're applying for programming boot camps or whatnot because a lot of the times you're gonna get a question like this they're gonna try to understand if not only you know how to write functions and algorithms but how efficiently you can write them so the iterative way is the way that I think you should approach this thank you for watching and I'll see you guys in the next video
