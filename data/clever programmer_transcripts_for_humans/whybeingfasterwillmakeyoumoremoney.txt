00:00 - hey guys how's it going distance Kanzi
00:02 - from clever programmer calm and in this
00:04 - video I want to tackle it's not really a
00:07 - question it's really a problem that I
00:09 - see pretty much everywhere so I'm just
00:10 - going to go ahead and tackle and put in
00:12 - the ask ecology show so without any
00:13 - further ado let's jump right into it
00:23 - a lot of the times I work with you guys
00:30 - and some of you guys I worked with you
00:32 - one-on-one but we are very slow a lot of
00:36 - the times with how we even use our
00:38 - computer so in this video I want to go
00:42 - over not really teach you too many
00:44 - technical things in this video I'm going
00:46 - to try to keep it simple and I'll try to
00:48 - give you something more tangible I get
00:50 - that a lot of you guys are like Kazi
00:51 - they're not there aren't things we can
00:54 - use right away and these are the soft
00:57 - skills that actually make you be able to
00:59 - charge a higher price whereas if I just
01:02 - show you hard technical skills every
01:04 - time well guess what everybody else can
01:06 - get them too and that just makes you
01:08 - like a commodity so um these are very
01:12 - important so before my Mike dies
01:15 - hopefully won't die I'll try to be
01:17 - faster here's what I'm gonna tell you
01:20 - the number one way to learn anything
01:22 - okay here's a secret the secret is speed
01:26 - alright I have number one secrets for
01:28 - everything but seriously this is like
01:30 - the number one powerful secret here's
01:33 - why my rule for learning anything is
01:36 - this it's I call it my 80 15-5 rule so a
01:40 - lot of people have 8020 - eighteen
01:42 - eighty fifteen five and here's how goes
01:45 - play build learn so 80% of the time
01:50 - should be spent playing with an idea
01:53 - okay just play play with any new thing
01:56 - that you're learning so if it's software
01:57 - development and coding you're trying to
01:59 - learn Python just play with it first
02:02 - learn the minimum amount to get you
02:04 - started and then play with it okay make
02:07 - your own little ideas make your own
02:08 - little apps or make your own little text
02:11 - adventure programs multiple choices
02:13 - multiple choice programs whatever it is
02:15 - then build so then work on a simple
02:19 - project that you can put together again
02:21 - maybe it's a text adventure maybe it's a
02:23 - bunch of if-else ten statements or maybe
02:26 - it's an actual app so build and then
02:31 - last one five percent of your time
02:33 - should be spent like learning new fury
02:35 - and knowledge and all that
02:37 - stuff okay naturally that time of
02:38 - learning you'll actually enjoy it more
02:40 - all right
02:42 - so most of your time should be spent
02:45 - playing then building then learning now
02:48 - what can help you go through the faster
02:50 - you can go through that cycle the faster
02:53 - you will learn but one of the things
02:55 - that stops you guys there are many
02:57 - things I see is like you guys very
03:00 - uncomfortable with your computer and you
03:04 - know a lot of us are tech savvy but
03:06 - things like even putting a window on
03:09 - half of the screen or like top-left
03:11 - quadrant of the screen or just like
03:14 - being quick to open tabs close tabs
03:17 - those things I see lacking and when you
03:20 - lack that speed a lot of times what
03:22 - happens is that not only are you slower
03:25 - but you don't learn things or you learn
03:27 - them slower here's an example let's say
03:30 - you find an online tutorial and you want
03:32 - to try it out you're like this is so
03:33 - awesome
03:33 - if you're fast you can quickly open a
03:35 - new tab open up sublime text open up
03:37 - your command line boom boom boom write
03:39 - up the code in sublime text go to your
03:41 - command line run the script and you have
03:43 - tried out this new thing and now that
03:45 - concept is stored in your head on how
03:47 - you can make this app or how you can
03:49 - actually make this piece of code run
03:51 - whereas on the other hand when you're
03:53 - really slow you drink your coffee you
03:56 - put it now you look at this tutorial
03:58 - you're like hmm this is a very good
04:02 - tutorial and you just passively breathe
04:05 - and read it and you take no action
04:08 - because it would take you like 30
04:10 - minutes or 40 minutes to get even the
04:12 - most basic amount of things up and
04:13 - running so if you are slow that is okay
04:18 - the best way to start improving your
04:20 - speed okay is to not say that so I don't
04:24 - care if you're freaking slow if you see
04:26 - a tutorial or you see something you can
04:28 - try stop and go and try it do it play
04:33 - with it and then build your own things
04:34 - with it and then go back to this
04:35 - tutorial okay very important since
04:38 - there's so many other technical things
04:40 - that I do want you guys to improve I'm
04:42 - not going to go too much into that
04:43 - because sometimes it's like I'll show
04:45 - you a Mac thing but then it's not
04:47 - Windows and some of you guys might use a
04:48 - bun too what I will show you is one
04:51 - things you can improve is your typing
04:53 - speed so please focus on improving your
04:56 - typing speed if it's like let's say if
04:58 - it's 30 words per minute or 40 words per
05:00 - minute try to get it a little bit higher
05:02 - and it'll help you go through that
05:04 - playbill learn cycle faster the faster
05:07 - you go through it the more apps you'll
05:08 - make the more like think of it like
05:11 - literally double your revenue and a lot
05:14 - of the times people think oh well to
05:17 - sync well and to make great things you
05:19 - don't have to be fast yes I totally get
05:22 - that with you but to think you need to
05:24 - have earn recognition right and you need
05:26 - lots of trial and error so if you have
05:29 - speed you can go through that trial and
05:31 - error really fast and build that pattern
05:34 - recognition that you need to think and
05:36 - make great apps or you know whatever
05:38 - like make cool websites or whatever it
05:42 - is that you want to do when you start
05:43 - learning how to code so I'm going to
05:46 - switch over to my computer screen and
05:49 - I'm going to play a typing game and you
05:52 - guys can actually try this out okay so
05:55 - if you're competitive I'll show you the
05:56 - competitive game first and it's fun as
05:58 - hell I found it recently and it's really
06:00 - cool and another one I'll show you is
06:02 - that this typing website and just you
06:04 - can go here and type you know once or
06:08 - twice a week for 20 minutes and they'll
06:10 - really help you improve your speed which
06:12 - will help you with that play build learn
06:13 - cycle which will help you get more
06:15 - clients and earn more revenue okay so
06:17 - they are related it's not typing speed
06:21 - doesn't just all like all the cool 20
06:23 - year old kids are doing and I'm not
06:25 - going to do it I'm like 40 years old and
06:27 - that ship has sailed the more you say
06:29 - the more you limit yourself okay if
06:32 - you're here to learn I want you to open
06:34 - your mind open your eyes follow along
06:36 - and try out new things so I'm going to
06:38 - do it for you and I don't care if you're
06:39 - 70 years old or 95 years old I want you
06:43 - to try this out with me so okay so now
06:46 - you guys are going to watch kind of over
06:48 - my shoulder and I'm going to play this
06:50 - first game it's going to be like a
06:52 - competitive typing game I found it and I
06:54 - absolutely love it and it gets started
06:57 - like instantly so and I'm going to show
06:59 - you other shortcuts along the way so
07:01 - command L to highlight the link of the
07:04 - URL bar
07:05 - so you're not actually let's go click it
07:07 - these things add up a lot of time so and
07:10 - I'm going to type in nitro type comm
07:14 - slash race this game is so fun so just
07:17 - get started right away it tries to find
07:19 - I'm going to put the volume on and
07:21 - basically it's trying to find fight for
07:23 - other players and it's like a five
07:25 - player racing game and how it works is
07:27 - they give you text to write and if you
07:29 - write that text that's how fast your car
07:31 - goes okay so whoever reaches the finish
07:34 - line first wins and therefore they'll be
07:37 - the fastest typer so it's getting
07:39 - started all right maybe I'll suck we'll
07:41 - see
07:42 - [Music]
08:00 - [Applause]
08:01 - [Music]
08:04 - that's really hard whoo okay so that was
08:23 - really hard with the camera and trying
08:26 - to commentate sorry I couldn't comment
08:28 - it at all um usually these people are
08:31 - not that fast
08:33 - I just got put in the group that was
08:36 - like really crazy so you can see that
08:39 - almost everybody was hitting around 100
08:42 - word per minute a typing speed mine was
08:45 - right now at 97 it fluctuates between 88
08:49 - and 100 depending on how easy or
08:52 - difficult the words are now I'm not the
08:54 - fastest typer but statistically I'm
08:56 - better than probably 95 percent or
08:58 - ninety percent of people on average so
09:02 - you know a lot of people I know my fall
09:04 - at 40 or 50 and once you improve a
09:07 - little bit of your typing speed you get
09:10 - here's the main problem that bothers me
09:13 - okay here here's what it is when you're
09:16 - not good at executing it limits your
09:19 - ability to think because you're so
09:21 - focused on oh what terminal should I
09:24 - open and what command should i type of
09:27 - what IDE should I open how is it
09:31 - configured with everything that's going
09:32 - on or the typing speed or the speed that
09:34 - you need to implement to follow the
09:36 - tutorial you're still concerned about
09:38 - all these technicalities that you can't
09:40 - think at a higher level you're not free
09:42 - to sync at a higher level and when
09:46 - you're faster and you know when these
09:49 - things are more natural to you you can
09:51 - think outside the box of you know when
09:53 - I'm coding it's not that I'm able to
09:56 - code really fast and that helps me like
09:58 - the more lines of code you can type it
10:00 - set I'm not worrying about the little
10:02 - minutia because I'm so comfortable in my
10:04 - computer my energy is not being spent
10:06 - how do I make the window 1/2 or how do I
10:09 - quickly open up a new tab or how do I do
10:11 - this research how do I switch between my
10:13 - virtual desktops because my mind is more
10:16 - focused on
10:17 - the higher-level things of how do I make
10:21 - this app better for my client what can I
10:24 - add to this website if I'm analyzing
10:26 - some data you know what are the key
10:29 - characteristics or variables that I need
10:31 - to keep in mind when I'm working on some
10:33 - things you know in Python or any
10:35 - language so you know speed is one of the
10:40 - most key things to help you improve your
10:43 - learning and not only your learning you
10:46 - know I want you to focus on the big
10:48 - picture here I'm a guy I'm big on
10:50 - results so you can't take learning to
10:52 - the bank but if you improve your speed
10:54 - you can take more money to the bank
10:57 - it'll directly add to your bottom line
10:59 - so tangible skill practice typing start
11:03 - from there and then always keep your eye
11:05 - open to new shortcuts and new things
11:08 - that you can add to improve your overall
11:11 - comfort level and speed so then you can
11:13 - focus focus more on the higher-level
11:16 - thinking that's required to make these
11:18 - apps alright guys that's it for this
11:20 - video thank you so much for watching
11:22 - comment below if you have any questions
11:24 - and we'll answer them for you in the ass
11:26 - causing segments and as always I love
11:28 - your faces off and I'll see you in the
11:32 - next video
11:37 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys how's it going distance Kanzi from clever programmer calm and in this video I want to tackle it's not really a question it's really a problem that I see pretty much everywhere so I'm just going to go ahead and tackle and put in the ask ecology show so without any further ado let's jump right into it a lot of the times I work with you guys and some of you guys I worked with you oneonone but we are very slow a lot of the times with how we even use our computer so in this video I want to go over not really teach you too many technical things in this video I'm going to try to keep it

these are very important so before my Mike dies hopefully won't die I'll try to be faster here's what I'm gonna tell you the number one way to learn anything okay here's a secret the secret is speed alright I have number one secrets for everything but seriously this is like the number one powerful secret here's why my rule for learning anything is this it's I call it my 80 155 rule so a lot of people have 8020 eighteen eighty fifteen five and here's how goes play build learn so 80% of the time should be spent playing with an idea okay just play play with any new thing that you're learning

much into that because sometimes it's like I'll show you a Mac thing but then it's not Windows and some of you guys might use a bun too what I will show you is one things you can improve is your typing speed so please focus on improving your typing speed if it's like let's say if it's 30 words per minute or 40 words per minute try to get it a little bit higher and it'll help you go through that playbill learn cycle faster the faster you go through it the more apps you'll make the more like think of it like literally double your revenue and a lot of the times people think oh well to sync

competitive I'll show you the competitive game first and it's fun as hell I found it recently and it's really cool and another one I'll show you is that this typing website and just you can go here and type you know once or twice a week for 20 minutes and they'll really help you improve your speed which will help you with that play build learn cycle which will help you get more clients and earn more revenue okay so they are related it's not typing speed doesn't just all like all the cool 20 year old kids are doing and I'm not going to do it I'm like 40 years old and that ship has sailed the more you say the more you limit yourself okay if you're here to learn I want you to open your mind open your eyes follow along and try out new things so I'm going to do it for you and I don't care if you're 70 years old or 95 years old I want you to try this out with me so okay so now you guys are going to watch kind of over my shoulder and I'm going to play this first game it's going to be like a competitive typing game I found it and I absolutely love it and it gets started like instantly so and I'm going to show you other shortcuts along the way so command L to highlight the link of the URL
