With timestamps:

00:00 - what thing is looking good bro the app
00:01 - is looking great let's set that
00:04 - let's go to whoa it looks clean
00:08 - oh that looks good let's click on
00:11 - my anime list
00:12 - and doesn't take me there takes me to my
00:15 - anime list
00:16 - if i go back dude this is a sick app he
00:19 - made
00:22 - we got a bunch of applications there are
00:24 - you that stand out like i
00:26 - kind of didn't really look that much at
00:29 - anybody that didn't submit a video so
00:32 - you must submit a video otherwise
00:33 - there's
00:34 - very little chance we'll review your
00:35 - application hey what's up guys
00:37 - today we're going to clean audio he's
00:39 - using
00:40 - router nice this code is looking good
00:42 - right yeah
00:43 - and he's using like grid components
00:46 - yeah i saw a grid component he's got a
00:49 - good teaching style and it look he's
00:50 - zoomed in just enough
00:52 - yeah and he's using sas uh he's using
00:55 - react context api in a way that we
00:57 - haven't used it before
00:58 - and he's using use history and all the
01:00 - stuff you show
01:02 - oh wow his uh github is looking really
01:04 - clean
01:05 - are you emailing him all yeah i just
01:07 - emailed him and i just
01:09 - uh told him to reach back out and shot
01:11 - on my number
01:12 - who else so then we have uh let's see
01:15 - bradley had a good video as well
01:17 - so we're looking at bradley's code right
01:20 - now
01:21 - and he submitted his application with us
01:23 - and he he did the
01:24 - tesla dude yeah so it's clean dude
01:27 - because
01:28 - we wanted to build this webpage so a
01:30 - good project just go ahead and copy
01:32 - yeah that's a good project to submit to
01:34 - us
01:35 - and we're just kind of kind of skimmed
01:37 - through that
01:41 - yeah using sass i like that he's using
01:43 - react
01:44 - i mean that's bonus points and then um
01:48 - i also like that he's actually on
01:49 - windows right yeah
01:51 - yeah oh yeah yeah because a lot of uh
01:53 - what most of our builds that we've done
01:55 - on mac so
01:56 - this will reach a lot more people yes
01:59 - because i know a lot of the people who
02:00 - watch the channel
02:01 - are on um on are on
02:04 - windows and then he goes through the
02:06 - build it's overall look
02:08 - go back for a sec when you're using
02:11 - important
02:12 - guys um important like unless you're
02:15 - using material ui but any in any kind of
02:17 - css stuff you don't want to use
02:19 - and you don't want to throw around the
02:21 - exclamation mark important and
02:23 - and here um go back to that
02:26 - jquery snippet your favorite jquery
02:31 - so guys wherever we see jquery it's an
02:34 - immediate no-go like we don't want
02:36 - jquery
02:37 - like if you there is always a way to
02:39 - write this stuff with the latest sort of
02:41 - javascript standards
02:42 - so jquery now is phased out it's not in
02:45 - a lot of the packages so it's not
02:46 - actually part of material um no it's not
02:48 - power bootstrap anymore
02:50 - yeah um so it's yeah it's pretty much
02:53 - it's eradicated now so you don't want to
02:55 - be using jquery
02:57 - so if you can go ahead and build
02:59 - something like this again
03:00 - with by using like react and then es6
03:03 - standards that would be awesome
03:04 - exactly so yeah i would i would uh
03:07 - that's what i would recommend and
03:08 - there's a lot of
03:09 - important stuff going on here yeah i
03:12 - mean there's a lot of
03:13 - uh nested like you see you've got like
03:16 - if you go to line 76 down
03:18 - there's a there is a ton of like
03:22 - i mean in this case if you're targeting
03:24 - this many things
03:26 - maybe i would have just given the same
03:27 - like given one class
03:29 - last name to everything and just target
03:31 - because right now you're doing tons of
03:33 - nesting
03:34 - it's super confused it's very coupled
03:37 - like if i want to change something now
03:38 - it's kind of like where do i change it
03:40 - without breaking stuff
03:41 - yeah so you want to make sure that your
03:44 - selectors are
03:46 - more granular than this yeah you're
03:49 - doing css work
03:51 - yeah exactly so there's some stuff with
03:55 - the code i think that could use
03:56 - improvement yeah overall i like the
03:59 - video
04:00 - in the corner though that's pretty good
04:01 - yeah and the presentation is really well
04:03 - he's well spoken
04:05 - yeah half half is good when you do that
04:07 - so when you show the app that you're
04:08 - working on as well as your code that's
04:10 - always a good sign
04:11 - but one thing i'll say is and it happens
04:13 - with all of us the energy tends to dip
04:16 - when we're talking yeah so try and
04:17 - always keep the energy up that's when
04:19 - you're
04:20 - yeah when you're demoing it yeah that's
04:22 - a big one guys
04:23 - that's big one and also make sure you
04:26 - submit because if you don't submit a
04:27 - video
04:28 - we're probably not even gonna take like
04:30 - we got this one guy right
04:32 - and he just submitted this to us
04:35 - so we don't know what to do with that
04:39 - yeah and also guys somebody submitted a
04:42 - youtube video
04:43 - but it was from 2018 yeah right put in
04:46 - the work shoot a new video
04:48 - yeah um because i'm only taking serious
04:50 - submissions yeah
04:52 - yeah and these are just applications
04:54 - we've gotten
04:55 - we've i have a lot of people dming me on
04:57 - instagram we have a ton of
04:59 - people these are 67 applications that
05:00 - we've gotten and then
05:02 - we have a bunch of people dm'ing on
05:03 - instagram and
05:05 - through email they're submitting
05:06 - applications too but please try to
05:08 - submit your application through this air
05:09 - table
05:10 - yeah um but yeah like send us because
05:14 - everybody everybody that follows us is a
05:17 - developer
05:18 - so if you don't make a video and send it
05:20 - to us like
05:22 - we're gonna like ignore anything else
05:24 - because we're looking for somebody who's
05:26 - looking to create
05:26 - content we're not looking for a software
05:28 - developer to
05:30 - make apps for us right like we're
05:31 - looking for somebody who will produce
05:33 - content for the channel
05:35 - exactly like simply dropping a link to a
05:38 - website that you built and your github
05:39 - is is not going to do anything but we
05:40 - pretty much skip over them
05:42 - um it has to have a video um
05:45 - we saw a few with videos um and those
05:48 - were very good attempts like but the
05:49 - ones that weren't like for example we've
05:51 - gone audio recording it's not gonna
05:52 - do anything guys like anything that we
05:55 - see like that is pretty much gonna go
05:56 - ahead and skip over it so
05:58 - exactly make sure you add a video to
06:01 - that
06:01 - that submission yeah so this is the one
06:04 - that you guys saw us talking about
06:06 - earlier this is the one that we really
06:08 - liked
06:09 - this is sick and he actually does it
06:11 - like a actual youtube video right so he
06:14 - yeah there's an intro to it hey what's
06:16 - up guys
06:17 - today we're gonna go over how to build a
06:18 - website using any api you want
06:20 - today we're going to use the my anime
06:22 - list api as well as we're going to use
06:24 - react.js
06:25 - as our front-end framework to build out
06:27 - the website hope you like it and let's
06:29 - get into it
06:30 - all right guys so the first literally 13
06:32 - seconds
06:33 - and he's in content like he done the
06:34 - intro very clear intro
06:36 - and and he's framed well as well like he
06:38 - had the framing
06:39 - of the shot pretty good the audio was
06:41 - crisp like and they also
06:43 - skip ahead to his code and his zoom is
06:45 - really good
06:46 - yeah he zooms into the screen so you can
06:49 - actually see the code and the code
06:51 - itself is like pretty good
06:53 - yep really clean code and uh and he
06:56 - shows like a complete build so it's a
06:58 - two hour build
06:59 - um all the way and he uses a bunch of
07:01 - different like
07:02 - he even has an outro so the intro and
07:04 - outro are very important
07:05 - he's actually dropped a piece of content
07:08 - as
07:09 - his sort of submission which is even
07:10 - better than just a sort of like video
07:12 - saying why you want a position like
07:14 - dropping us content like this is going
07:15 - to be what we're kind of looking for
07:17 - because it shows us that you can do it
07:19 - like it literally shows us
07:20 - exactly because we appreciate like you
07:23 - saying you want to work for clever
07:24 - programmer and you believe in the vision
07:26 - like we
07:26 - appreciate that but we're looking for
07:29 - the actual
07:30 - work right now like just show us your
07:33 - work
07:33 - then if we have an interview then you
07:35 - can tell us like
07:37 - why you believe in it or what you're
07:38 - looking for but our ultimate goal
07:41 - is we have found this to be the best way
07:43 - to help
07:45 - developers at a global level and we just
07:47 - want to keep
07:48 - maximizing creating content for them
07:52 - and helping them so just show us the
07:54 - work and that will be a good place to be
07:56 - at we went through a bunch
07:58 - of people's before we even started
08:00 - recording this video
08:02 - but those are the few that stood out to
08:04 - us like bradley stood out and then
08:06 - peras was i think um
08:09 - like i think that was one of the best
08:10 - submissions absolutely
08:13 - yeah so make it so if you want to model
08:15 - somebody model perasa's one where
08:18 - he just kind of intros it right away and
08:20 - then boom he starts making the video
08:23 - and there are not so many us and ums and
08:26 - dead time and low energy the energy is
08:28 - just
08:28 - high so keep that energy high right when
08:31 - you're recording it you have to
08:32 - understand human beings are following
08:33 - you
08:34 - if you're doing a two three hour build
08:36 - and your energy is low
08:37 - somebody will feel depressed and not
08:39 - want to actually build it
08:41 - yeah and guys as a test watch back your
08:43 - content and think would i watch this
08:45 - like
08:46 - and don't be biased so it's very easy to
08:47 - be biased towards your own content
08:48 - because you're like this is the best
08:50 - thing ever
08:50 - but really be like critical and try and
08:53 - look back
08:54 - and and as a sort of exercise if every
08:56 - time you say um
08:58 - or uh like literally restart like
09:00 - literally restart and then
09:02 - really be quite like forceful in
09:03 - yourself yeah yeah
09:05 - so exactly just slow down and you can
09:08 - speak again and try to
09:12 - remove the crazy arms and others but to
09:15 - be completely honest
09:16 - even if you have the ons and um like
09:19 - it's not going to make the world of a
09:20 - difference
09:20 - as long as your speaking ability is good
09:25 - your presentation is good you've
09:27 - prepared the code in advance and we can
09:29 - see
09:30 - that you're flowing through it your
09:33 - project is good those are the things
09:36 - that
09:36 - really matter above every everything
09:41 - yeah because i mean like we all yeah it
09:43 - is a good point actually
09:45 - because like you don't have to be the
09:47 - best on camera that's not really what
09:49 - we're looking for like
09:50 - that can come with time that can be an
09:51 - improvement like as long as you're
09:52 - willing to put yourself out there
09:54 - and do it but the main thing is like
09:56 - perez's video the reason why it stood
09:57 - out so much is
09:58 - he covered a lot of different concepts
10:01 - in his video
10:02 - and he taught it really well yeah he
10:04 - thought it really cleaned up
10:05 - very well because like i know like
10:07 - elizabeth flucher code who follows the
10:09 - channel a lot right and she
10:11 - she you're coaching her right now too
10:13 - mentorship and then i know
10:15 - she wants to apply for this as well she
10:18 - has a very soft
10:19 - she's very soft-spoken so her video is
10:21 - not going to start off with like
10:23 - it doesn't need to start off with like
10:24 - yo what's up guys this is like it
10:26 - doesn't need to be that
10:28 - but she could just be like hey guys
10:29 - today we're going to build an airbnb
10:31 - clone let's jump right into it and boom
10:33 - it just switches there and she's like
10:34 - so here we're working on her reactor she
10:36 - can be soft-spoken but as long as
10:38 - it's clear yeah presentation is good the
10:42 - code is good
10:44 - the project is good that is
10:47 - you know like really really powerful
10:50 - exactly and everyone has their own style
10:52 - guys just like because you might see
10:54 - somebody like like me and carzio and
10:55 - we're quite like
10:56 - loud at times it doesn't mean that you
10:58 - have to be loud i mean like everyone has
11:00 - a different style
11:01 - and a lot of people sort of relate to
11:03 - different styles um and
11:05 - and it can work for you and it could
11:06 - actually be a lot better than our style
11:08 - um it just depends on sort of like just
11:10 - be yourself like be yourself on camera
11:12 - when you try and put on a on a different
11:14 - persona that's when we can kind of see
11:16 - through it and it doesn't really come
11:17 - across that well on camera so
11:19 - i'd say just just be yourself and it
11:21 - doesn't matter if you're shy or you're
11:22 - nervous like just you actually
11:24 - reaching out and sending us a submission
11:26 - in the first place shows us that you're
11:27 - willing to put in that extra step and
11:29 - that extra effort
11:30 - and beyond that as long as like you can
11:31 - sort of break down concepts and
11:33 - principles and teach it well
11:34 - the rest is kind of like can be improved
11:36 - over time that's right
11:38 - yep yep so with that said the link
11:42 - is still below this video the air table
11:45 - link
11:46 - click it apply make a dedicated video
11:50 - and we're looking to hire somebody
11:52 - within this
11:53 - week so don't sleep on it there's not

12:16 - heavy
12:18 - you know and for you it's like super
12:20 - dope because you make
12:21 - you want to learn coding you'll keep
12:23 - learning it and you keep making content
12:25 - on it and then it just makes such a big
12:27 - impact in people's lives and that's
12:29 - really like the ultimate thing
12:31 - exactly also a bonus thing we actually
12:33 - went into perez's github and found his
12:36 - he had a social media account so he had
12:38 - an instagram account

12:40 - there as well so like that's an added
12:42 - bonus
12:43 - right like if you can show that you're
12:44 - sort of you're you're you're quite like
12:46 - you're already producing content that's
12:48 - going to be something which is awesome

13:08 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

what thing is looking good bro the app is looking great let's set that let's go to whoa it looks clean oh that looks good let's click on my anime list and doesn't take me there takes me to my anime list if i go back dude this is a sick app he made we got a bunch of applications there are you that stand out like i kind of didn't really look that much at anybody that didn't submit a video so you must submit a video otherwise there's very little chance we'll review your application hey what's up guys today we're going to clean audio he's using router nice this code is looking good right yeah and he's using like grid components yeah i saw a grid component he's got a good teaching style and it look he's zoomed in just enough yeah and he's using sas uh he's using react context api in a way that we haven't used it before and he's using use history and all the stuff you show oh wow his uh github is looking really clean are you emailing him all yeah i just emailed him and i just uh told him to reach back out and shot on my number who else so then we have uh let's see bradley had a good video as well so we're looking at bradley's code right now and he submitted his application with us and he he did the tesla dude yeah so it's clean dude because we wanted to build this webpage so a good project just go ahead and copy yeah that's a good project to submit to us and we're just kind of kind of skimmed through that yeah using sass i like that he's using react i mean that's bonus points and then um i also like that he's actually on windows right yeah yeah oh yeah yeah because a lot of uh what most of our builds that we've done on mac so this will reach a lot more people yes because i know a lot of the people who watch the channel are on um on are on windows and then he goes through the build it's overall look go back for a sec when you're using important guys um important like unless you're using material ui but any in any kind of css stuff you don't want to use and you don't want to throw around the exclamation mark important and and here um go back to that jquery snippet your favorite jquery so guys wherever we see jquery it's an immediate nogo like we don't want jquery like if you there is always a way to write this stuff with the latest sort of javascript standards so jquery now is phased out it's not in a lot of the packages so it's not actually part of material um no it's not power bootstrap anymore yeah um so it's yeah it's pretty much it's eradicated now so you don't want to be using jquery so if you can go ahead and build something like this again with by using like react and then es6 standards that would be awesome exactly so yeah i would i would uh that's what i would recommend and there's a lot of important stuff going on here yeah i mean there's a lot of uh nested like you see you've got like if you go to line 76 down there's a there is a ton of like i mean in this case if you're targeting this many things maybe i would have just given the same like given one class last name to everything and just target because right now you're doing tons of nesting it's super confused it's very coupled like if i want to change something now it's kind of like where do i change it without breaking stuff yeah so you want to make sure that your selectors are more granular than this yeah you're doing css work yeah exactly so there's some stuff with the code i think that could use improvement yeah overall i like the video in the corner though that's pretty good yeah and the presentation is really well he's well spoken yeah half half is good when you do that so when you show the app that you're working on as well as your code that's always a good sign but one thing i'll say is and it happens with all of us the energy tends to dip when we're talking yeah so try and always keep the energy up that's when you're yeah when you're demoing it yeah that's a big one guys that's big one and also make sure you submit because if you don't submit a video we're probably not even gonna take like we got this one guy right and he just submitted this to us so we don't know what to do with that yeah and also guys somebody submitted a youtube video but it was from 2018 yeah right put in the work shoot a new video yeah um because i'm only taking serious submissions yeah yeah and these are just applications we've gotten we've i have a lot of people dming me on instagram we have a ton of people these are 67 applications that we've gotten and then we have a bunch of people dm'ing on instagram and through email they're submitting applications too but please try to submit your application through this air table yeah um but yeah like send us because everybody everybody that follows us is a developer so if you don't make a video and send it to us like we're gonna like ignore anything else because we're looking for somebody who's looking to create content we're not looking for a software developer to make apps for us right like we're looking for somebody who will produce content for the channel exactly like simply dropping a link to a website that you built and your github is is not going to do anything but we pretty much skip over them um it has to have a video um we saw a few with videos um and those were very good attempts like but the ones that weren't like for example we've gone audio recording it's not gonna do anything guys like anything that we see like that is pretty much gonna go ahead and skip over it so exactly make sure you add a video to that that submission yeah so this is the one that you guys saw us talking about earlier this is the one that we really liked this is sick and he actually does it like a actual youtube video right so he yeah there's an intro to it hey what's up guys today we're gonna go over how to build a website using any api you want today we're going to use the my anime list api as well as we're going to use react.js as our frontend framework to build out the website hope you like it and let's get into it all right guys so the first literally 13 seconds and he's in content like he done the intro very clear intro and and he's framed well as well like he had the framing of the shot pretty good the audio was crisp like and they also skip ahead to his code and his zoom is really good yeah he zooms into the screen so you can actually see the code and the code itself is like pretty good yep really clean code and uh and he shows like a complete build so it's a two hour build um all the way and he uses a bunch of different like he even has an outro so the intro and outro are very important he's actually dropped a piece of content as his sort of submission which is even better than just a sort of like video saying why you want a position like dropping us content like this is going to be what we're kind of looking for because it shows us that you can do it like it literally shows us exactly because we appreciate like you saying you want to work for clever programmer and you believe in the vision like we appreciate that but we're looking for the actual work right now like just show us your work then if we have an interview then you can tell us like why you believe in it or what you're looking for but our ultimate goal is we have found this to be the best way to help developers at a global level and we just want to keep maximizing creating content for them and helping them so just show us the work and that will be a good place to be at we went through a bunch of people's before we even started recording this video but those are the few that stood out to us like bradley stood out and then peras was i think um like i think that was one of the best submissions absolutely yeah so make it so if you want to model somebody model perasa's one where he just kind of intros it right away and then boom he starts making the video and there are not so many us and ums and dead time and low energy the energy is just high so keep that energy high right when you're recording it you have to understand human beings are following you if you're doing a two three hour build and your energy is low somebody will feel depressed and not want to actually build it yeah and guys as a test watch back your content and think would i watch this like and don't be biased so it's very easy to be biased towards your own content because you're like this is the best thing ever but really be like critical and try and look back and and as a sort of exercise if every time you say um or uh like literally restart like literally restart and then really be quite like forceful in yourself yeah yeah so exactly just slow down and you can speak again and try to remove the crazy arms and others but to be completely honest even if you have the ons and um like it's not going to make the world of a difference as long as your speaking ability is good your presentation is good you've prepared the code in advance and we can see that you're flowing through it your project is good those are the things that really matter above every everything yeah because i mean like we all yeah it is a good point actually because like you don't have to be the best on camera that's not really what we're looking for like that can come with time that can be an improvement like as long as you're willing to put yourself out there and do it but the main thing is like perez's video the reason why it stood out so much is he covered a lot of different concepts in his video and he taught it really well yeah he thought it really cleaned up very well because like i know like elizabeth flucher code who follows the channel a lot right and she she you're coaching her right now too mentorship and then i know she wants to apply for this as well she has a very soft she's very softspoken so her video is not going to start off with like it doesn't need to start off with like yo what's up guys this is like it doesn't need to be that but she could just be like hey guys today we're going to build an airbnb clone let's jump right into it and boom it just switches there and she's like so here we're working on her reactor she can be softspoken but as long as it's clear yeah presentation is good the code is good the project is good that is you know like really really powerful exactly and everyone has their own style guys just like because you might see somebody like like me and carzio and we're quite like loud at times it doesn't mean that you have to be loud i mean like everyone has a different style and a lot of people sort of relate to different styles um and and it can work for you and it could actually be a lot better than our style um it just depends on sort of like just be yourself like be yourself on camera when you try and put on a on a different persona that's when we can kind of see through it and it doesn't really come across that well on camera so i'd say just just be yourself and it doesn't matter if you're shy or you're nervous like just you actually reaching out and sending us a submission in the first place shows us that you're willing to put in that extra step and that extra effort and beyond that as long as like you can sort of break down concepts and principles and teach it well the rest is kind of like can be improved over time that's right yep yep so with that said the link is still below this video the air table link click it apply make a dedicated video and we're looking to hire somebody within this week so don't sleep on it there's not permanent amount of time by september 30th or before it will have found somebody um who's like kind of ready to go fulltime and again just to be clear it's like fulltime position we're looking for and we're looking for somebody to make dedicated content for clever programmer for eight hours a day so it's content heavy you know and for you it's like super dope because you make you want to learn coding you'll keep learning it and you keep making content on it and then it just makes such a big impact in people's lives and that's really like the ultimate thing exactly also a bonus thing we actually went into perez's github and found his he had a social media account so he had an instagram account and he actually had some good content on there as well so like that's an added bonus right like if you can show that you're sort of you're you're you're quite like you're already producing content that's going to be something which is awesome as well it's like kind of a cherry on the top exactly yep so with that said go ahead click that link below if you're already making the video and apply and best of luck exactly guys and hopefully we'll see you on the team oh
