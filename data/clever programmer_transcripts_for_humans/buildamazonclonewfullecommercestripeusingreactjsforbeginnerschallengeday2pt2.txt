01:41 - okay dope so let's keep going and
01:44 - uh let's just jump right into it so
01:46 - sunny take over and now we're gonna
01:47 - start just coating it up
01:49 - let's do it dude so we now have
01:53 - the um oh i see yeah i found it again
01:56 - it's come under a different one but
01:57 - that's completely fine we can sort this
01:58 - out
01:59 - um it's come under the uh what's up
02:02 - clone with man stat quasi
02:03 - so just get the guys maybe change that
02:05 - they're they're changing it yeah
02:07 - okay so so now what we have guys is we
02:10 - pretty much have
02:11 - this starting ground so we have hello
02:12 - clever programmers let's build the
02:14 - amazon store
02:15 - right so once we're at this point what
02:17 - we want to do is we want to basically
02:19 - just do some markdown so i like to
02:20 - comment things
02:22 - and it keeps everything very sort of
02:24 - easy to understand so let's go ahead and
02:25 - add our first comment
02:26 - in this one what we're going to do is
02:28 - we're going to go ahead and add
02:30 - the uh the header so we're going to go
02:32 - ahead and say the header first
02:34 - because what we're going to do is we're
02:35 - first going to have a header and then
02:37 - we're going to have a
02:38 - home component right so the header is
02:40 - essentially
02:42 - so the header essentially is the
02:46 - um going to be the top part of the
02:48 - amazon app right so the header component
02:51 - on the amazon app
02:52 - then we have the rest of the body which
02:54 - we're basically going to be called
02:55 - we're going to be calling the home
02:57 - component okay
02:58 - so because what we could do is i'm not
03:01 - sure if it's going to if
03:03 - it may lag too much in showing this what
03:05 - we could do is show them um
03:07 - the facebook i don't know the amazon uh
03:10 - app if we've got it open
03:11 - yeah we've got the deployment yep so
03:14 - yeah we actually want to do so the top
03:16 - part right there so it says amazon at
03:18 - the top
03:19 - that's going to be the header component
03:21 - and then we have the home component
03:23 - which is going to be underneath
03:25 - everything underneath it is in part of
03:26 - the
03:27 - home component everything above is the
03:30 - header component got it right
03:33 - so that's what we're going to go ahead
03:35 - and do and then what we're going to go
03:37 - ahead and do guys
03:38 - is we're going to go and create these
03:40 - components so the first thing we're
03:41 - going to do is
03:42 - create a file called header.js
03:46 - so coz let's go ahead and create a
03:48 - header.js
03:49 - all right um um i'll open this up
03:55 - right here we'll go header
03:58 - and this is since this is going to be a
04:00 - component oops let me go to this screen
04:02 - right here
04:03 - since this is going to be a component
04:05 - guys what we need to do is capitalize
04:07 - that h
04:08 - right there so let's hit enter and
04:12 - the the code that this file is going to
04:14 - contain
04:15 - hopefully if i can still draw is this
04:18 - header that you guys see over here so
04:21 - i'm going to grab that header
04:22 - right there so that header that you guys
04:26 - see
04:26 - here that's what's going to be
04:30 - in that file okay so just to be very
04:33 - clear with what code goes there
04:35 - exactly so once we're inside that file
04:38 - we're going to use something called es7
04:40 - snippets so in order to install these
04:42 - you just need to go over to the
04:44 - extensions
04:45 - inside of react inside of vs code sorry
04:48 - and go ahead type in es7
04:50 - and these are going to be the snippets
04:51 - that you see us using throughout the
04:53 - three days in these builds
04:55 - this is going to help you be extremely
04:56 - fast with your development
04:58 - and it allows you to do a really nice
05:00 - little shortcut that we use in every
05:02 - build which is called
05:03 - rfce and when you type in rfce
05:06 - let's go ahead and follow yep nice when
05:08 - we type in rfce
05:10 - it actually goes ahead and it renders
05:12 - out a complete functional component with
05:14 - the correct name so that's really cool
05:16 - and then what we're going to do is we're
05:18 - going to give this a class name
05:20 - and we're going to give this one class
05:21 - name of header because it's the header
05:22 - component
05:23 - and then we're going to go ahead and
05:24 - also give this its own css file
05:27 - so we need to go ahead and say inside
05:29 - this folder let's go ahead and
05:31 - import the header.css so before
05:34 - what we now need to do is create a
05:36 - header.css file
05:38 - so inside of our source folder i'm going
05:40 - to create a header.css
05:42 - file and you should see us pop into that
05:44 - file right
05:46 - any second now so i have now just jumped
05:49 - inside of the header.css file
05:52 - and you can see any css that we are
05:54 - going to include inside of our header
05:56 - component
05:56 - we're pretty much going to write inside
05:58 - of this header.css file and i can see a
06:00 - lot of people are coming back to this
06:01 - video now which is awesome
06:02 - we have everyone coming back nice
06:04 - awesome guys yeah welcome back
06:06 - it dropped down for a little bit but we
06:08 - are still
06:09 - building the amazon clone and i just
06:11 - want to say
06:12 - internet is being shaky but we're here
06:14 - and we're going to persevere through the
06:16 - challenge so just
06:17 - keep coming back if it dies just join us
06:20 - right back for those of you who care
06:22 - about this i know you guys will show up
06:24 - because we will just keep showing up for
06:25 - you okay so i don't know if it happens
06:27 - again because i know
06:28 - whenever you're trying to actually do
06:30 - something important internet dies and
06:32 - like every problem in the world happens
06:35 - like crazy stuff has started happening
06:37 - in the house too
06:38 - but we're back and we're not going
06:40 - anywhere so we're gonna just keep coming
06:42 - back live i don't care what it takes but
06:44 - let's keep going guys exactly right
06:47 - let's get the energy back up so what
06:49 - we're gonna do inside of the header
06:51 - component
06:52 - is where basically we got we have the
06:55 - amazon logo on the left we have this
06:56 - nice beautiful search in the middle
06:58 - and then we have all of the icons and
07:01 - where it says hello sign in
07:03 - returns and orders your prime everything
07:05 - like that on the
07:06 - right hand side now so what we're going
07:09 - to do let me just
07:09 - ask you these questions right so on the
07:11 - left hand side we got this logo that
07:13 - you're talking about the amazon one
07:15 - yeah because that's one thing that we're
07:16 - gonna be building in this header
07:19 - the second thing we're gonna be building
07:20 - in the header is um
07:22 - this search input field that's in the
07:24 - middle with the search icon right
07:26 - yeah the third thing we're gonna build
07:28 - are these like nice little four
07:30 - four things on the right hand side which
07:32 - we call children
07:35 - exactly got it beautiful okay exactly
07:38 - right
07:38 - so inside of the uh code right now what
07:41 - we're gonna do is we're just gonna
07:42 - sort of mask out each of them right so
07:44 - the first thing we're going to do is
07:45 - we're going to have an image component
07:48 - so let's go ahead and add the image
07:49 - component so it's my
07:51 - it's not working so that's fine we can
07:53 - do this it's going to be an image
07:54 - component
07:55 - and the source for this one is just
07:56 - going to be
07:58 - a picture of amazon so i went ahead and
08:00 - grabbed a source of amazon earlier
08:02 - so i'm going to go ahead and pop that in
08:03 - right here just like so so there we go
08:06 - and then what i'm going to do is i'm
08:07 - going to give it a class name so a class
08:09 - name of header underscore underscore
08:11 - logo
08:11 - as such so what we need to do now is
08:15 - styling is not working one second guys
08:18 - let's go ahead and make this look nicer
08:21 - yeah so then we have the image with the
08:24 - class name
08:25 - header logo and the source like so
08:27 - that's going to be a picture of amazon
08:29 - the next thing we're going to do is
08:30 - we're going to create a div and
08:32 - everything inside so that middle search
08:33 - component
08:34 - we're actually going to have a container
08:35 - so a div so div
08:37 - and we're going to say div dot header
08:40 - underscore underscore search
08:41 - like so right and now with this uh my ms
08:45 - not working again so i need to basically
08:47 - go ahead and do the following
08:50 - header like so
08:54 - and then do this nice
08:57 - and what we have here guys is the header
09:00 - search
09:00 - so inside of here we're going to
09:02 - basically have an input field and a
09:04 - search icon
09:05 - so it's going to basically represent
09:07 - what we have as the finished product so
09:09 - i'm going to go ahead and chuck in a
09:11 - input right here so an input
09:14 - field and that's going to be the header
09:16 - search and then we're also going to have
09:17 - a
09:18 - logo but we're going to come back to
09:19 - this and this is where we use material
09:20 - ui to go ahead and get that number the
09:23 - one that i'm highlighting that's going
09:24 - to be the amazon logo right or no
09:27 - yeah exactly that's going to be the
09:28 - amazon logo and then this
09:30 - search is going to be that thing right
09:34 - there
09:35 - exactly bro yeah okay that's going to be
09:37 - the middle bit
09:38 - and the final right hand side
09:42 - is going to be what we call the header
09:44 - nav
09:45 - so let's go ahead and check that right
09:47 - now so the header nav
09:48 - as such so over here
09:53 - we really need prettier to work super
09:55 - annoying um
09:57 - okay i'll try hitting save i think that
09:59 - should work
10:00 - yeah save let me go ahead and just
10:03 - double check as
10:04 - let me quickly do one thing it might
10:05 - make it quick
10:07 - format on save oh yeah so guys you can
10:11 - do this as well we have an extension
10:13 - called
10:13 - prettier so this is a good extension for
10:15 - you to get if you don't have it already
10:18 - and once you install it um we're okay
10:21 - hold on let me see
10:23 - you can just hit command comma or just
10:24 - go to settings
10:26 - top here and then you can basically do
10:29 - if i look for format
10:31 - on save you could do hit check mark on
10:33 - format on save
10:34 - and then every time you save it will
10:36 - like format your code and make it look
10:38 - pretty
10:40 - exactly exactly guys um
10:43 - you want to go ahead and do that and
10:45 - then that will get it working
10:47 - and now what you want to do is for the
10:49 - header nav
10:50 - causing maybe this to the oil i'll save
10:52 - every five seconds that'll be kind of
10:53 - cool oh i thought we had it on
10:55 - no no i think we maybe got that off
10:58 - because that might be a
10:59 - easier way of formatting it okay so
11:02 - where does that show up hold on auto
11:04 - save after delay yeah it's after delay
11:06 - oh okay so 500 milliseconds after every
11:10 - file
11:11 - okay cool so we've got the header nav so
11:14 - now what we're going to do is inside of
11:15 - the header nav we're going to have a few
11:17 - different uh options but
11:19 - let's go ahead and actually fill out
11:20 - things because let's get the local host
11:22 - running so let's get localhost
11:24 - 3000 showing up on the right um
11:28 - we could do that in a sec so for now
11:30 - guys we had the header underscore nav
11:32 - and inside of here what we're going to
11:33 - do is we're going to have three
11:34 - different options right
11:35 - so it's we're going to have a few
11:37 - different divs so i'm going to go ahead
11:39 - and create a div and each one is going
11:40 - to be
11:41 - resemblance of what we have on the right
11:43 - hand side where it says hello sign in
11:45 - where it says returns and orders where
11:46 - it says your prime
11:47 - so i'm going to go ahead and pop that in
11:49 - as so so we've got that here
11:52 - and this is going to say class name like
11:54 - this and we're going to say
11:56 - header underscore underscore option
11:59 - and i'm going to go ahead and this will
12:01 - basically be where you have where
12:02 - for example it says hello sign in so you
12:05 - see on the top left it says something
12:06 - like hello sign in
12:07 - those are the sort of things that we're
12:09 - going to have inside of these divs
12:11 - all right so i'm going to go ahead copy
12:12 - it and there'll be a second one and
12:14 - there'll be a third one
12:16 - let's go ahead and format this in nicely
12:17 - there we go
12:20 - now for this bit guys what we're going
12:22 - to do is we're going to
12:23 - sort of span in some stuff here so i'm
12:26 - going to go ahead and create
12:28 - so for the first option we're going to
12:30 - say options what are you referring to
12:33 - so this one right here on the top on the
12:35 - right hand side so
12:37 - the where it says hello sign in returns
12:39 - and options okay all of those are
12:40 - considered
12:41 - header options okay so let me just be
12:43 - clear so this
12:44 - so for example this over here is
12:46 - probably referring to
12:48 - this one thing and that's like option
12:51 - one right
12:52 - exactly and then this is option two
12:56 - it says option three and then this over
12:59 - here is option four right
13:01 - exactly we don't know why we call it
13:03 - option but that's just
13:04 - kind of the naming convention yeah i
13:07 - mean we can call it you can call it
13:09 - whatever you guys want
13:10 - uh we've gone with option today because
13:12 - it's a navbar option so it's like inside
13:15 - of the network it's an option inside an
13:16 - app bar but you can call it anything you
13:18 - want just make sure that it's consistent
13:19 - when you
13:20 - go to style it inside of your css file
13:23 - um so that will save you a lot right so
13:26 - now inside of header option we're going
13:29 - to have two span tags right
13:31 - so let's go ahead and drop the first
13:33 - span tag in him right now so i'm going
13:34 - to go ahead and do span
13:36 - the class name for this one is going to
13:38 - be
13:39 - let's go ahead and drop a class name
13:40 - it's going to be header underscore
13:42 - underscore
13:43 - option line 1 right so this is going to
13:46 - be the first line and then
13:48 - inside of this one what we're gonna have
13:49 - we're gonna this is gonna say
13:52 - this one's gonna say hello sonny
13:55 - right and we're gonna make this sort of
13:57 - but in this case or we could just say
13:58 - hello
13:59 - user or hello guest because we're not
14:01 - going to be logged in right now
14:02 - we're going to paste it again so we're
14:04 - going to copy that line of code paste it
14:05 - we're going to change the m2
14:07 - and the second line in this case was uh
14:10 - let's go ahead and do sign
14:11 - in right it's going to be a sign in
14:13 - button now what i want you guys to do is
14:15 - go ahead
14:16 - and copy this these two lines of code
14:18 - paste it here
14:19 - make sure your indentation is clean use
14:21 - prettier it will help you out
14:22 - go ahead and do the same thing here make
14:24 - sure and for the second one what we're
14:26 - going to have is we're going to say
14:27 - returns
14:28 - and down here we're going to say and
14:30 - orders
14:32 - and for the third one we're going to say
14:33 - your over here and we're going to say
14:36 - prime
14:38 - like so okay so you've got hello guest
14:40 - signing returns orders and your prime
14:42 - now with that said what we're gonna have
14:45 - is at the end of it
14:47 - so we have all of those options we have
14:49 - those three options
14:50 - so let's go actually let's go and load
14:52 - up our localhost kazi nice
14:53 - okay so let's go ahead and go to our
14:57 - host here and we're going to hit save or
15:00 - hit refresh so there we go that's our
15:01 - local host now the re the reason why
15:03 - it's not showing up guys
15:05 - is because we have inside of app.js
15:09 - here we actually haven't rendered the
15:11 - header component so
15:12 - to render it what we need to do is go
15:14 - ahead and do the following we need to
15:16 - say header
15:17 - like so that's how we use a component
15:19 - but then we're gonna actually need to go
15:20 - ahead and
15:20 - all we're doing here guys is the code
15:22 - that we wrote in this file called header
15:24 - js we didn't put it into our app
15:27 - js so that's exactly what he's doing
15:28 - he's going to import it right there
15:31 - and then he's going to literally use
15:32 - that exact component
15:34 - and right here and that's why it's
15:37 - showing
15:37 - up right underneath and now you can see
15:40 - all of these things are showing up right
15:42 - there
15:44 - yep yep exactly yeah so
15:47 - now what we are going to do is we are
15:50 - going to go in her so now i should
15:51 - render this you can see
15:52 - all the stuff is popping on the screen
15:53 - now the reason why you can't see the
15:55 - amazon text is
15:56 - simply because it is a white piece of
15:59 - text so it's going to be a white
16:00 - background so it's not going to be very
16:01 - clear
16:02 - so let's go ahead and style some of this
16:04 - stuff so it looks a little bit more
16:05 - clean and
16:06 - visual to see so what we're going to do
16:10 - here is let's go and head over to our
16:12 - header.css
16:13 - and the first thing i'm going to do guys
16:14 - is if you notice here
16:16 - we have the header container we're going
16:18 - to go ahead and style that so i'm going
16:20 - to say
16:20 - for the header let's go ahead and say it
16:22 - gives the following
16:24 - rules okay so i'm going to give it a
16:26 - height of 60 pixels
16:28 - a display of flex which and then we're
16:31 - going to say display flex
16:32 - then we're going to say align item
16:34 - center background color
16:36 - and this is a this is the amazon
16:38 - background color
16:39 - so you can see it's giving it a back uh
16:41 - black background color
16:43 - and then the position is sticky so it
16:44 - means it'll stick to the top so as we
16:46 - scroll down it'll stick there
16:48 - and it's that index of 100 so this is a
16:49 - really good comment i just want to
16:51 - highlight this as you guys are watching
16:53 - this
16:53 - um we have carlos and he just says
16:58 - he's like hey yo kazi i'm here watching
17:00 - while i head out to show a few homes
17:02 - so that's epic dude that's awesome and
17:05 - he goes wish that i could code at the
17:06 - same time
17:07 - but i hope that it gets recorded he is
17:09 - currently says watching while driving
17:11 - i don't recommend it but i'm serious to
17:14 - learn for your information so
17:16 - that is epic uh just be careful please
17:19 - while you're driving
17:21 - and also this is gonna be recorded so if
17:24 - you're watching this and you're like hey
17:25 - just like carlos like i can't keep up
17:27 - with this right this second don't worry
17:29 - you can always watch the recordings all
17:31 - right and we have the slack community
17:32 - everybody to help you out
17:34 - but we're going to be going through at a
17:35 - pretty fast pace just so we can show and
17:38 - demonstrate everything
17:40 - exactly guys and then that way when you
17:42 - watch it back you can watch it back
17:44 - uh slower you can watch it back keep
17:46 - stopping the video and
17:47 - as you need to do it you can do it so
17:50 - like that now
17:51 - the next thing we're going to do is you
17:52 - see that image is huge right
17:54 - it's very hard to see what's going on
17:56 - with that image so what we did is we
17:57 - went ahead and gave our image the header
17:59 - logo class so we're going to go ahead
18:01 - and target that header logo
18:03 - and we're going to make it look a lot
18:06 - cleaner so we're going to go ahead and
18:07 - target the header logo
18:09 - like so and here what we're going to do
18:12 - is
18:12 - already what was that it's already
18:15 - starting to look clean
18:16 - like yeah to that one line exactly
18:19 - yeah so you see that one line so we've
18:21 - got this like one little bit of code
18:23 - here
18:23 - but the width of 100 pixels object fit
18:25 - contain
18:26 - means that it is essentially going to uh
18:29 - keep its
18:29 - aspect ratio so it looks very clean when
18:31 - we do that margin
18:33 - here is saying zero on the top of uh i
18:36 - think it's top and bottom at 20 on the
18:37 - left and right
18:38 - a margin top of 18 pixels nice so we
18:41 - have that in place that looks good
18:42 - the next thing we're going to do is
18:43 - we're going to go over to
18:46 - the let's go ahead and actually fix the
18:48 - header search
18:49 - so we need the logo inside of our header
18:52 - search
18:52 - so cause let's go ahead and open up the
18:54 - firstly let's go ahead and get rid of
18:56 - where it says hello clever programmers
18:58 - because it looks a little bit confusing
18:59 - so i'm going to go ahead and delete that
19:00 - save
19:01 - now we've just got the amazon bar at the
19:02 - top so it looks clean
19:05 - now what i want to do is show you guys
19:07 - how to install
19:09 - material ui into your project so guys
19:11 - let's head over to material ui
19:14 - yep let's do it so now we're gonna go
19:16 - i'm gonna open a new tab
19:17 - and we're gonna go material ui and this
19:19 - is what we're using for all the icons
19:21 - so if you guys look over here the basket
19:23 - icon that we have at the top right
19:26 - or we have the search icon all of this
19:29 - is coming from
19:30 - material ui that's why we're here and in
19:33 - order to install it guys make sure you
19:35 - copy this line of code that says npm
19:37 - install
19:38 - material ui core i'm going to hit
19:39 - command j
19:41 - and then i'm going to go to my command
19:43 - line that i'm currently not using
19:44 - i'm just going to cd into my amazon
19:46 - clone and i'm going to hit command v
19:49 - to paste what i copied and boom now it's
19:52 - installing this
19:53 - as this installs um what i'm going to do
19:57 - is what is it sony's the fonts yep
20:00 - so i'm going to go it is icons icons
20:04 - so i'm gonna go and click on icons
20:07 - all right yeah and then scroll down to
20:11 - where it says search the full list of
20:13 - icons
20:14 - thank you um so click where it says
20:16 - search the full list of icons and before
20:18 - you do that make sure you copy this line
20:20 - that says npm install material ui icons
20:24 - that's another installation you're going
20:25 - to need i'm going to pop that in here
20:27 - and i'm going to hit paste
20:29 - and hit enter all right and as distance
20:32 - i'm going to click where it says search
20:33 - the full list of these icons
20:37 - now it's gonna take me in there boom
20:41 - and now if i type in anything like
20:43 - search
20:44 - or whatever have you it should pop up
20:47 - those icons
20:48 - and even when you need the code for them
20:50 - you just click into it and it's gonna
20:52 - actually give you the code
20:54 - that you can write to pop that icon into
20:56 - your app so it's
20:57 - really really epic exactly
21:01 - yeah and we're going to use that guys if
21:02 - you see us pulling in code to your app
21:05 - or at any point this is how we go ahead
21:07 - and find those icons
21:09 - so let's go ahead and start using that
21:12 - stuff so
21:13 - inside of our header.js what we are
21:15 - going to do is go to our header.js and
21:18 - we are going to go ahead and use
21:19 - an icon called the search icon so in
21:22 - order to pull this into our project we
21:24 - actually went ahead and
21:25 - installed that earlier um i think it's
21:28 - still installing right cozy
21:30 - yeah yeah so we need we're gonna need to
21:32 - wait for that to install
21:34 - um okay
21:37 - yeah we're gonna have to wait for that
21:38 - one to go ahead and so um
21:41 - let's just see wait wait for what to
21:43 - install
21:44 - the material oh yeah there we go both of
21:46 - it installed
21:48 - yeah mine was a bit delayed nice okay so
21:51 - that's been installed now so that what
21:53 - we need to do is go to the
21:54 - top and import the search icon so up
21:57 - here i need to go ahead and import
21:59 - search icon from material ui search
22:00 - icons
22:01 - there we go and then what we're going to
22:03 - do is head over down to the bom
22:06 - and we are going to go ahead and have
22:08 - inside of the header search div
22:11 - the search icon like so okay
22:14 - now if we go ahead and save this and go
22:16 - back to our localhost
22:21 - we should be able to see it's actually
22:22 - going to be very dark right so it's
22:24 - actually going to be very dark to see
22:25 - so we gave it a last name it's there but
22:27 - it's like possible yeah it's just really
22:29 - dark
22:30 - exactly yeah so it's very very dark so
22:33 - what we're going to do is we're actually
22:34 - going to go ahead and make that very
22:35 - visible at this point
22:37 - so to go ahead and give that some color
22:39 - what we're going to do
22:40 - is we're going to go target it so we're
22:42 - going to say go to the header search
22:43 - icon
22:44 - and then we are going to go ahead and
22:46 - say give it some padding
22:48 - some height and a background color right
22:50 - so i'm going to go ahead and give it the
22:52 - following styles
22:53 - and then save and you guys can now see
22:56 - it's got a background color which is the
22:58 - amazon orange
22:59 - right and then we have a padding of 5
23:02 - pixels and a height of 22 pixels
23:05 - okay now you see the alignment is all
23:08 - messed up
23:09 - right the alignment is always it's
23:10 - always it's all messed up so we're going
23:12 - to go ahead and use flexbox
23:14 - yeah it's all wonky right now to fix
23:17 - that what we do is we say
23:18 - target the header search are we going to
23:21 - be using flexbox here
23:23 - yeah exactly hey i love
23:26 - me some flexbox exactly guys so flexbox
23:30 - is going to really help you get
23:32 - the responsive design it's going to
23:34 - allow you to restructure things on a web
23:35 - page very
23:36 - easily and what we're going to do is
23:37 - we're going to include this code right
23:39 - here so we're going to say display flex
23:41 - we're going to say flex 1 i'll explain
23:43 - what this does in a sec
23:44 - align item center is what was what was
23:47 - responsible for pulling that logo
23:49 - centrally with the input field
23:52 - and then we're giving it a border radius
23:54 - of 24 pixels now
23:56 - the interesting part here guys is that
23:57 - you can see header search is actually
24:00 - surrounding the input field and the
24:01 - search icon
24:02 - so that's why when we did display flex
24:05 - everything went into a row because when
24:06 - you apply a display

Cleaned transcript:

okay damn i'm getting nervous we could we could do uh we could redo this case we could just redo the stream on mine it just went offline on youtube and they got killed so um are we still live on facebook we're live again okay now we have 22 people live why did it disconnect should i just turn off wifi no don't i wouldn't do that again okay okay so i think we're live um and let's keep let's keep going let's keep going yeah shoot up are we back on are we back on youtube um no i have 300 plus people live so i'm not exactly sure where yeah we're live on the wrong name so we'll have to change the name there and um on facebook i hope that we're live soon i don't know what the does anybody know if we're live on facebook okay all right so let's keep on going guys okay dope so let's keep going and uh let's just jump right into it so sunny take over and now we're gonna start just coating it up let's do it dude so we now have the um oh i see yeah i found it again it's come under a different one but that's completely fine we can sort this out um it's come under the uh what's up clone with man stat quasi so just get the guys maybe change that they're they're changing it yeah okay so so now what we have guys is we pretty much have this starting ground so we have hello clever programmers let's build the amazon store right so once we're at this point what we want to do is we want to basically just do some markdown so i like to comment things and it keeps everything very sort of easy to understand so let's go ahead and add our first comment in this one what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and add the uh the header so we're going to go ahead and say the header first because what we're going to do is we're first going to have a header and then we're going to have a home component right so the header is essentially so the header essentially is the um going to be the top part of the amazon app right so the header component on the amazon app then we have the rest of the body which we're basically going to be called we're going to be calling the home component okay so because what we could do is i'm not sure if it's going to if it may lag too much in showing this what we could do is show them um the facebook i don't know the amazon uh app if we've got it open yeah we've got the deployment yep so yeah we actually want to do so the top part right there so it says amazon at the top that's going to be the header component and then we have the home component which is going to be underneath everything underneath it is in part of the home component everything above is the header component got it right so that's what we're going to go ahead and do and then what we're going to go ahead and do guys is we're going to go and create these components so the first thing we're going to do is create a file called header.js so coz let's go ahead and create a header.js all right um um i'll open this up right here we'll go header and this is since this is going to be a component oops let me go to this screen right here since this is going to be a component guys what we need to do is capitalize that h right there so let's hit enter and the the code that this file is going to contain hopefully if i can still draw is this header that you guys see over here so i'm going to grab that header right there so that header that you guys see here that's what's going to be in that file okay so just to be very clear with what code goes there exactly so once we're inside that file we're going to use something called es7 snippets so in order to install these you just need to go over to the extensions inside of react inside of vs code sorry and go ahead type in es7 and these are going to be the snippets that you see us using throughout the three days in these builds this is going to help you be extremely fast with your development and it allows you to do a really nice little shortcut that we use in every build which is called rfce and when you type in rfce let's go ahead and follow yep nice when we type in rfce it actually goes ahead and it renders out a complete functional component with the correct name so that's really cool and then what we're going to do is we're going to give this a class name and we're going to give this one class name of header because it's the header component and then we're going to go ahead and also give this its own css file so we need to go ahead and say inside this folder let's go ahead and import the header.css so before what we now need to do is create a header.css file so inside of our source folder i'm going to create a header.css file and you should see us pop into that file right any second now so i have now just jumped inside of the header.css file and you can see any css that we are going to include inside of our header component we're pretty much going to write inside of this header.css file and i can see a lot of people are coming back to this video now which is awesome we have everyone coming back nice awesome guys yeah welcome back it dropped down for a little bit but we are still building the amazon clone and i just want to say internet is being shaky but we're here and we're going to persevere through the challenge so just keep coming back if it dies just join us right back for those of you who care about this i know you guys will show up because we will just keep showing up for you okay so i don't know if it happens again because i know whenever you're trying to actually do something important internet dies and like every problem in the world happens like crazy stuff has started happening in the house too but we're back and we're not going anywhere so we're gonna just keep coming back live i don't care what it takes but let's keep going guys exactly right let's get the energy back up so what we're gonna do inside of the header component is where basically we got we have the amazon logo on the left we have this nice beautiful search in the middle and then we have all of the icons and where it says hello sign in returns and orders your prime everything like that on the right hand side now so what we're going to do let me just ask you these questions right so on the left hand side we got this logo that you're talking about the amazon one yeah because that's one thing that we're gonna be building in this header the second thing we're gonna be building in the header is um this search input field that's in the middle with the search icon right yeah the third thing we're gonna build are these like nice little four four things on the right hand side which we call children exactly got it beautiful okay exactly right so inside of the uh code right now what we're gonna do is we're just gonna sort of mask out each of them right so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to have an image component so let's go ahead and add the image component so it's my it's not working so that's fine we can do this it's going to be an image component and the source for this one is just going to be a picture of amazon so i went ahead and grabbed a source of amazon earlier so i'm going to go ahead and pop that in right here just like so so there we go and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to give it a class name so a class name of header underscore underscore logo as such so what we need to do now is styling is not working one second guys let's go ahead and make this look nicer yeah so then we have the image with the class name header logo and the source like so that's going to be a picture of amazon the next thing we're going to do is we're going to create a div and everything inside so that middle search component we're actually going to have a container so a div so div and we're going to say div dot header underscore underscore search like so right and now with this uh my ms not working again so i need to basically go ahead and do the following header like so and then do this nice and what we have here guys is the header search so inside of here we're going to basically have an input field and a search icon so it's going to basically represent what we have as the finished product so i'm going to go ahead and chuck in a input right here so an input field and that's going to be the header search and then we're also going to have a logo but we're going to come back to this and this is where we use material ui to go ahead and get that number the one that i'm highlighting that's going to be the amazon logo right or no yeah exactly that's going to be the amazon logo and then this search is going to be that thing right there exactly bro yeah okay that's going to be the middle bit and the final right hand side is going to be what we call the header nav so let's go ahead and check that right now so the header nav as such so over here we really need prettier to work super annoying um okay i'll try hitting save i think that should work yeah save let me go ahead and just double check as let me quickly do one thing it might make it quick format on save oh yeah so guys you can do this as well we have an extension called prettier so this is a good extension for you to get if you don't have it already and once you install it um we're okay hold on let me see you can just hit command comma or just go to settings top here and then you can basically do if i look for format on save you could do hit check mark on format on save and then every time you save it will like format your code and make it look pretty exactly exactly guys um you want to go ahead and do that and then that will get it working and now what you want to do is for the header nav causing maybe this to the oil i'll save every five seconds that'll be kind of cool oh i thought we had it on no no i think we maybe got that off because that might be a easier way of formatting it okay so where does that show up hold on auto save after delay yeah it's after delay oh okay so 500 milliseconds after every file okay cool so we've got the header nav so now what we're going to do is inside of the header nav we're going to have a few different uh options but let's go ahead and actually fill out things because let's get the local host running so let's get localhost 3000 showing up on the right um we could do that in a sec so for now guys we had the header underscore nav and inside of here what we're going to do is we're going to have three different options right so it's we're going to have a few different divs so i'm going to go ahead and create a div and each one is going to be resemblance of what we have on the right hand side where it says hello sign in where it says returns and orders where it says your prime so i'm going to go ahead and pop that in as so so we've got that here and this is going to say class name like this and we're going to say header underscore underscore option and i'm going to go ahead and this will basically be where you have where for example it says hello sign in so you see on the top left it says something like hello sign in those are the sort of things that we're going to have inside of these divs all right so i'm going to go ahead copy it and there'll be a second one and there'll be a third one let's go ahead and format this in nicely there we go now for this bit guys what we're going to do is we're going to sort of span in some stuff here so i'm going to go ahead and create so for the first option we're going to say options what are you referring to so this one right here on the top on the right hand side so the where it says hello sign in returns and options okay all of those are considered header options okay so let me just be clear so this so for example this over here is probably referring to this one thing and that's like option one right exactly and then this is option two it says option three and then this over here is option four right exactly we don't know why we call it option but that's just kind of the naming convention yeah i mean we can call it you can call it whatever you guys want uh we've gone with option today because it's a navbar option so it's like inside of the network it's an option inside an app bar but you can call it anything you want just make sure that it's consistent when you go to style it inside of your css file um so that will save you a lot right so now inside of header option we're going to have two span tags right so let's go ahead and drop the first span tag in him right now so i'm going to go ahead and do span the class name for this one is going to be let's go ahead and drop a class name it's going to be header underscore underscore option line 1 right so this is going to be the first line and then inside of this one what we're gonna have we're gonna this is gonna say this one's gonna say hello sonny right and we're gonna make this sort of but in this case or we could just say hello user or hello guest because we're not going to be logged in right now we're going to paste it again so we're going to copy that line of code paste it we're going to change the m2 and the second line in this case was uh let's go ahead and do sign in right it's going to be a sign in button now what i want you guys to do is go ahead and copy this these two lines of code paste it here make sure your indentation is clean use prettier it will help you out go ahead and do the same thing here make sure and for the second one what we're going to have is we're going to say returns and down here we're going to say and orders and for the third one we're going to say your over here and we're going to say prime like so okay so you've got hello guest signing returns orders and your prime now with that said what we're gonna have is at the end of it so we have all of those options we have those three options so let's go actually let's go and load up our localhost kazi nice okay so let's go ahead and go to our host here and we're going to hit save or hit refresh so there we go that's our local host now the re the reason why it's not showing up guys is because we have inside of app.js here we actually haven't rendered the header component so to render it what we need to do is go ahead and do the following we need to say header like so that's how we use a component but then we're gonna actually need to go ahead and all we're doing here guys is the code that we wrote in this file called header js we didn't put it into our app js so that's exactly what he's doing he's going to import it right there and then he's going to literally use that exact component and right here and that's why it's showing up right underneath and now you can see all of these things are showing up right there yep yep exactly yeah so now what we are going to do is we are going to go in her so now i should render this you can see all the stuff is popping on the screen now the reason why you can't see the amazon text is simply because it is a white piece of text so it's going to be a white background so it's not going to be very clear so let's go ahead and style some of this stuff so it looks a little bit more clean and visual to see so what we're going to do here is let's go and head over to our header.css and the first thing i'm going to do guys is if you notice here we have the header container we're going to go ahead and style that so i'm going to say for the header let's go ahead and say it gives the following rules okay so i'm going to give it a height of 60 pixels a display of flex which and then we're going to say display flex then we're going to say align item center background color and this is a this is the amazon background color so you can see it's giving it a back uh black background color and then the position is sticky so it means it'll stick to the top so as we scroll down it'll stick there and it's that index of 100 so this is a really good comment i just want to highlight this as you guys are watching this um we have carlos and he just says he's like hey yo kazi i'm here watching while i head out to show a few homes so that's epic dude that's awesome and he goes wish that i could code at the same time but i hope that it gets recorded he is currently says watching while driving i don't recommend it but i'm serious to learn for your information so that is epic uh just be careful please while you're driving and also this is gonna be recorded so if you're watching this and you're like hey just like carlos like i can't keep up with this right this second don't worry you can always watch the recordings all right and we have the slack community everybody to help you out but we're going to be going through at a pretty fast pace just so we can show and demonstrate everything exactly guys and then that way when you watch it back you can watch it back uh slower you can watch it back keep stopping the video and as you need to do it you can do it so like that now the next thing we're going to do is you see that image is huge right it's very hard to see what's going on with that image so what we did is we went ahead and gave our image the header logo class so we're going to go ahead and target that header logo and we're going to make it look a lot cleaner so we're going to go ahead and target the header logo like so and here what we're going to do is already what was that it's already starting to look clean like yeah to that one line exactly yeah so you see that one line so we've got this like one little bit of code here but the width of 100 pixels object fit contain means that it is essentially going to uh keep its aspect ratio so it looks very clean when we do that margin here is saying zero on the top of uh i think it's top and bottom at 20 on the left and right a margin top of 18 pixels nice so we have that in place that looks good the next thing we're going to do is we're going to go over to the let's go ahead and actually fix the header search so we need the logo inside of our header search so cause let's go ahead and open up the firstly let's go ahead and get rid of where it says hello clever programmers because it looks a little bit confusing so i'm going to go ahead and delete that save now we've just got the amazon bar at the top so it looks clean now what i want to do is show you guys how to install material ui into your project so guys let's head over to material ui yep let's do it so now we're gonna go i'm gonna open a new tab and we're gonna go material ui and this is what we're using for all the icons so if you guys look over here the basket icon that we have at the top right or we have the search icon all of this is coming from material ui that's why we're here and in order to install it guys make sure you copy this line of code that says npm install material ui core i'm going to hit command j and then i'm going to go to my command line that i'm currently not using i'm just going to cd into my amazon clone and i'm going to hit command v to paste what i copied and boom now it's installing this as this installs um what i'm going to do is what is it sony's the fonts yep so i'm going to go it is icons icons so i'm gonna go and click on icons all right yeah and then scroll down to where it says search the full list of icons thank you um so click where it says search the full list of icons and before you do that make sure you copy this line that says npm install material ui icons that's another installation you're going to need i'm going to pop that in here and i'm going to hit paste and hit enter all right and as distance i'm going to click where it says search the full list of these icons now it's gonna take me in there boom and now if i type in anything like search or whatever have you it should pop up those icons and even when you need the code for them you just click into it and it's gonna actually give you the code that you can write to pop that icon into your app so it's really really epic exactly yeah and we're going to use that guys if you see us pulling in code to your app or at any point this is how we go ahead and find those icons so let's go ahead and start using that stuff so inside of our header.js what we are going to do is go to our header.js and we are going to go ahead and use an icon called the search icon so in order to pull this into our project we actually went ahead and installed that earlier um i think it's still installing right cozy yeah yeah so we need we're gonna need to wait for that to install um okay yeah we're gonna have to wait for that one to go ahead and so um let's just see wait wait for what to install the material oh yeah there we go both of it installed yeah mine was a bit delayed nice okay so that's been installed now so that what we need to do is go to the top and import the search icon so up here i need to go ahead and import search icon from material ui search icons there we go and then what we're going to do is head over down to the bom and we are going to go ahead and have inside of the header search div the search icon like so okay now if we go ahead and save this and go back to our localhost we should be able to see it's actually going to be very dark right so it's actually going to be very dark to see so we gave it a last name it's there but it's like possible yeah it's just really dark exactly yeah so it's very very dark so what we're going to do is we're actually going to go ahead and make that very visible at this point so to go ahead and give that some color what we're going to do is we're going to go target it so we're going to say go to the header search icon and then we are going to go ahead and say give it some padding some height and a background color right so i'm going to go ahead and give it the following styles and then save and you guys can now see it's got a background color which is the amazon orange right and then we have a padding of 5 pixels and a height of 22 pixels okay now you see the alignment is all messed up right the alignment is always it's always it's all messed up so we're going to go ahead and use flexbox yeah it's all wonky right now to fix that what we do is we say target the header search are we going to be using flexbox here yeah exactly hey i love me some flexbox exactly guys so flexbox is going to really help you get the responsive design it's going to allow you to restructure things on a web page very easily and what we're going to do is we're going to include this code right here so we're going to say display flex we're going to say flex 1 i'll explain what this does in a sec align item center is what was what was responsible for pulling that logo centrally with the input field and then we're giving it a border radius of 24 pixels now the interesting part here guys is that you can see header search is actually surrounding the input field and the search icon so that's why when we did display flex everything went into a row because when you apply a display
