00:00 - what's up guys
00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - how are you guys doing this is qazi from
00:14 - cleverprogrammer.com
00:16 - super amazing to get started this early
00:17 - in the morning it's actually
00:21 - what time is it it's 7 25 a.m
00:24 - for this live stream pacific so if
00:26 - you're in chicago
00:28 - or in you're in new york
00:31 - i think it'll be it'll be a little bit
00:33 - later right and then if you are in
00:35 - michigan it should be about 10
00:37 - something a.m 10 25 a.m
00:41 - and yeah just let me know where you guys
00:42 - coming in from are you guys coming in
00:44 - is anybody here from new york or chicago
00:49 - welcome guys
00:52 - so today guys i want to talk about alter
00:55 - ego
00:56 - and productivity i think this is very
00:58 - important for
00:59 - developers for people in general
01:02 - i mean i just call the developers at the
01:04 - end because i think it makes it relevant
01:06 - to everybody
01:08 - but this is something that has been on
01:10 - top of my mind
01:11 - for a while we got people from mexico
01:14 - fortune from
01:15 - dallas from hungary nice
01:19 - switzerland ruth aye
01:23 - alexander mexico killed london let's go
01:26 - in a ukraine melbourne berkeley
01:31 - hungary nepal nice you guys
01:36 - awesome so keep the chat clean guys
01:40 - if anybody is uh doing anything more
01:42 - than once
01:43 - just block them don't even give a
01:45 - warning so it just keeps it clean
01:47 - now this is something i've been thinking
01:50 - about for the last few days and it's
01:52 - something that's been
01:53 - on top of my mind and it's something i
01:55 - want to share
01:56 - with everybody i hope it brings you
01:59 - value
02:01 - but one thing that i've been realizing
02:03 - is
02:05 - as my time gets
02:08 - tighter and tighter and there are more
02:12 - challenges and restrictions and
02:15 - responsibilities that i have to face
02:18 - what i get left with is
02:21 - a lot of competing priorities that need
02:24 - to fit in a 24-hour time span
02:29 - probably resonates with a lot of you
02:33 - but the problem comes in is when
02:37 - you feel like you cannot fill that
02:39 - 24-hour time span
02:41 - with all of the things that you actually
02:43 - want to do
02:44 - and so you sometimes get in this cycle
02:46 - of damn
02:48 - am i doing enough do i need to do more
02:51 - and just sometimes like not being as
02:55 - effective as you can be
02:57 - and so for me
03:00 - yo what's up corey how you doing yeah i
03:03 - think gigi ball asks are you an
03:05 - introvert yeah i think i'm an introvert
03:11 - who has developed the capabilities to be
03:13 - an extrovert when i need to be
03:15 - but i think like i just i prefer
03:17 - probably being an introvert more
03:21 - and so i started this off with my
03:24 - instagram stories
03:26 - and i started just like writing out my
03:28 - thoughts at night and i just shared them
03:29 - with
03:30 - with people in general and then
03:33 - like these thoughts that i had shared
03:35 - started getting a ton of engagement
03:37 - from the people and so i thought it
03:40 - might be a good thing to do a video on
03:42 - it might just bring
03:43 - value to everybody so
03:46 - started off with me just kind of
03:48 - realizing i was like time to admit it
03:51 - i haven't been doing what i need to be
03:53 - doing so one area of my life that i've
03:56 - been really lacking
03:57 - in is working out
04:02 - hard and i haven't been doing that
04:06 - i kept using corona as an excuse
04:11 - and i would always say i'll just train
04:12 - once the gyms open up it'll be fine for
04:14 - now i'll just focus on clever programmer
04:19 - the truth is i haven't done [ __ ] all
04:23 - i was watching my content from a year
04:25 - and a half ago and i saw myself and i
04:27 - was becoming a
04:29 - [ __ ] monster i was
04:32 - fast powerful i was quick and explosive
04:35 - i was like
04:35 - training lifting hard in the gym i was
04:38 - doing kickboxing i was doing jiu jitsu
04:40 - there were so many things that i was
04:41 - doing
04:44 - i was rapidly improving in boxing
04:46 - strength and speed
04:47 - was on my [ __ ] and going hard
04:52 - and i feel like that's kind of what made
04:54 - me who i am today
04:56 - right even if i look back in 2017 i was
04:59 - waking up
04:59 - oftentimes at 5 5 30 a.m i would go lift
05:03 - really hard then i would go and like
05:05 - read books
05:06 - and learn and then i would go and do
05:08 - other things
05:13 - now one reason i feel like i haven't
05:16 - been physically doing a lot of
05:18 - training is because i miss
05:21 - lifting weights i don't know if this you
05:24 - guys ever feel that
05:25 - i know some people like body weights but
05:27 - for me it's like body weight just
05:28 - doesn't do the trick for me and i don't
05:30 - really enjoy it as much as
05:32 - getting on a heavy like deadlift or a
05:36 - squat i also like
05:38 - love hitting hard so whether i'm doing
05:40 - boxing or kickboxing just the
05:43 - feeling of like you got something there
05:45 - to
05:46 - hit on like that's a good feeling
05:49 - whereas shadowboxing is not that fun
05:54 - it's cool but again
05:57 - all excuses however
06:00 - those things did stop me
06:04 - now a few things that even if it comes
06:07 - to the parallel that i can draw for you
06:09 - between
06:11 - me training my body and new training
06:13 - maybe coding
06:14 - is there are a few things that i say
06:16 - that i think could be really relevant to
06:18 - you right so for me one
06:22 - i'm gonna start off by having some
06:24 - solutions so one of the solution that i
06:27 - decided to come up with is finding
06:30 - places that are open to work out that
06:31 - have that equipment which
06:33 - not many places to set up speakers
06:35 - upstairs in my house so i can blast
06:37 - music and get equipment in my house as
06:39 - well so
06:40 - change for me that means like changing
06:43 - my environment
06:44 - and sometimes even if you want to code
06:46 - or you're trying to
06:47 - work on something changing the your
06:49 - environment can help
06:52 - number three i said neural
06:56 - rewiring and what i meant by is record
07:00 - and watch myself
07:01 - train every single night recording an
07:04 - ungodly amount of instagram stories and
07:06 - then watching myself train when i'm
07:08 - going to sleep
07:10 - that is going to keep rewiring my brain
07:13 - and keep me mentally sharp
07:16 - lifting and working out and kickboxing
07:19 - that was stuff i never wanted to do
07:21 - i had to develop the habit of it
07:24 - by recording myself through literally
07:26 - doing instagram stories
07:29 - by the end of the day i would have these
07:30 - tiny little dots at the top
07:33 - and then what i would do is i would just
07:35 - tap through them at night before i'd be
07:37 - going to sleep and i would watch myself
07:38 - working out
07:43 - the beauty of that was
07:47 - i felt primed
07:50 - when i woke up the next day i felt like
07:52 - a lion just ready to go
07:55 - and i would just boom
07:59 - if you documented your journey of
08:02 - becoming a developer
08:03 - and you wrote things
08:07 - and you took stories of yourself coding
08:10 - even
08:10 - whether it's time lapses or photos or
08:13 - just you
08:14 - coding and you watched it at night
08:19 - i promise that would rewire you to want
08:21 - to code the next day as well
08:24 - and number five or number four was
08:26 - immersion for me which was
08:28 - i had to force myself to break out of
08:30 - the pattern of watching dumb garbage at
08:32 - night
08:33 - so i have this habit of watching
08:36 - chess i love chess absolutely love it
08:40 - so every single night i've been watching
08:44 - chess you know every time i'm about to
08:46 - go to sleep
08:47 - every time i have any down time like if
08:49 - i have to wait one second for you like
08:51 - literally if you and i were hanging out
08:52 - you're like bro i'm gonna go grab a
08:54 - bottle of water
08:56 - if we're talking i'll be chatting with
08:58 - you what's up bro how you doing like hey
09:01 - but if there was like one second or
09:04 - you're like bro i'm gonna go and
09:06 - grab a drink you know i'm gonna go and
09:08 - i'm gonna hit the restroom and i'll be
09:09 - right back
09:11 - i will open up chess and i will play a
09:14 - speed chess game of like
09:15 - two minutes right one minute bullet
09:17 - chess
09:20 - so that was my pat i was watching all
09:22 - the stuff at night and so i
09:23 - thought okay i need to replace that
09:27 - with something that's entertaining so i
09:29 - still feel like i'm snacking
09:31 - and it's fun but it's instead
09:34 - the things that i want my life to look
09:36 - like right so for example
09:38 - chess is not gonna really help my
09:40 - lifestyle even though i enjoy it
09:44 - but what i started watching was i
09:46 - started watching like max tuning's
09:48 - vlogs on fitness and that
09:51 - was basically a really good thing for
09:54 - immersion for me which was just it
09:56 - immersed me in the world of fitness
09:59 - so hmm
10:04 - okay
10:11 - that is annoying somebody just keeps
10:14 - like sending me the same message again
10:16 - and again and again and again on my
10:17 - instagram
10:18 - so it just keeps buzzing my phone and
10:19 - literally like sir can you please
10:22 - fix my header.js header.js file
10:25 - just copy it and just pasting it pasting
10:27 - it enter enter
10:28 - like if they did it maybe 700 times that
10:32 - would get my attention and maybe i'd
10:33 - help out
10:35 - but anyways so i thought okay immersion
10:38 - so let me immerse myself in things that
10:40 - can improve my life
10:42 - that meant for me watching tick tocks
10:46 - instagram content or youtube content
10:48 - stuff that i was going to do anyway
10:50 - but now i want it to be designed to
10:52 - actually
10:53 - change my behavior to do the thing that
10:56 - i want to do
10:57 - i remember when i used to want to code
10:59 - more
11:00 - i would watch crazy amount of content on
11:04 - coding all the time non-stop
11:07 - and i would try to find entertaining
11:09 - content so i could watch it before i
11:11 - would be sleeping
11:14 - so yeah that was that was the part of
11:16 - immersion that i wanted to
11:17 - do now i want to talk about like
11:21 - alter ego i'm breaking it down with
11:25 - alter ego and then ego okay so that's
11:27 - two things
11:28 - so alter ego being your devil
11:33 - right
11:36 - and then ego being your angel side
11:40 - so they're not technically correct terms
11:42 - i'm sure somebody the psychologist
11:44 - will be like no you're talking about ig
11:47 - ego and your id
11:48 - or some weird stuff like that that's
11:50 - okay that's just how i'm defining them
11:52 - so just follow along with me and
11:54 - hopefully it'll give some
11:56 - perspective so i'm i wrote here i'm like
11:59 - i have a very
12:00 - powerful alter ego it's what makes me
12:04 - deeply want to outwork everyone's
12:07 - face and prove them wrong which also
12:10 - makes me an [ __ ]
12:12 - seem arrogant offend people
12:17 - i've had to learn a lot i have
12:20 - had to learn to let a lot of it go in
12:22 - order to become a better leader
12:25 - the pro of subduing my alter ego i wrote
12:28 - is
12:29 - made me a better leader less threatening
12:33 - polite inclusive empathetic
12:36 - emotional caring loving understanding
12:38 - introspective and
12:40 - develop other leaders so
12:43 - focusing so much on that side of me
12:47 - um
12:50 - but yeah so by letting kind of go of my
12:53 - alter you go the thing that drove me so
12:54 - i remember back in 2017 i was just like
12:58 - go like qazi like you're the best like i
13:00 - had so many things that i would actually
13:02 - say that i kind of
13:03 - cringe and saying right now but i'm like
13:05 - nobody can [ __ ] outwork me
13:07 - my work is the best work like i will
13:09 - work your face
13:11 - like i will outwork you when it comes to
13:12 - coding like i will make something better
13:14 - than you can
13:16 - i will outlift you i will like
13:19 - pretty much anything you can think of i
13:21 - would tell myself
13:22 - and because i was a one-man army i
13:25 - really needed that part of me to be
13:27 - alive like kind of that animalistic part
13:29 - right where
13:30 - when fight or flight kicks in you go in
13:33 - this place
13:34 - you go in this mode we all have that
13:36 - place
13:37 - you don't all you're not always there
13:39 - but what about like when it comes to
13:41 - protecting somebody in your family
13:42 - or there's something there's somebody
13:44 - disrespects somebody that you care about
13:46 - right we all have that like animalistic
13:48 - mode
13:49 - i used a lot of that to initially build
13:52 - myself up
13:53 - and to grow my channel and to put in the
13:56 - work and to do coding and
13:58 - you know to be able to do the 15 to 16
14:01 - hours
14:02 - a day of work now
14:06 - that was the positive side of letting my
14:09 - alter ego go which was
14:11 - you know becoming a better leader more
14:12 - empathetic does that kind of make sense
14:15 - i hope so looking in the chat
14:20 - frank says why low on energy no i'm just
14:22 - it's just a morning bro and i'm just
14:24 - chilling by myself so
14:26 - no really reason to be crazy high energy
14:28 - but you know i can be
14:30 - but not i'm just i'm kind of in my
14:34 - deep reflective mode which you know i'm
14:37 - actually kind of like this one i'm just
14:38 - thinking i'm by myself like i'm thinking
14:41 - i'm not always like yo what's up guys
14:43 - like you know
14:44 - like i'm not sitting like normally by
14:46 - myself doing that
14:49 - so
14:52 - okay all right so
14:57 - all right anyways now the con of it i
15:01 - felt like was it made me
15:03 - uh soft never outworking or outshining
15:07 - anyone
15:08 - and literally even in the yeah like
15:10 - sometimes i was even telling the team
15:11 - i'm like guys sometimes i literally
15:13 - don't go into team meetings because i
15:14 - feel like when i go there
15:16 - it scares the people or they don't want
15:18 - to talk a lot
15:19 - so when i'm there i'm actually genuinely
15:22 - sometimes not trying to share ideas
15:25 - which is my fault right and me not
15:27 - having me not have a good communication
15:29 - skills
15:29 - but i'm like i don't want to outshine
15:31 - anybody and then i would feel like some
15:33 - of the team members would get quiet or
15:35 - they maybe felt
15:36 - intimidated or something so
15:39 - those are the cons but then i don't get
15:41 - to sharpen my sword right
15:43 - if i'm helping a lot of other people
15:45 - sharpen their sword and maybe if you
15:46 - feel like that you're helping a lot of
15:48 - other people
15:49 - sharpen their sword it won't actually
15:52 - help
15:53 - you that much sometimes and so i felt
15:56 - that
15:57 - the biggest pro and the biggest con
16:00 - of killing give me one second
16:17 - so yeah i felt like the biggest problem
16:18 - the biggest con of killing my alter ego
16:20 - in one sentence was i can develop
16:22 - leaders at my expense
16:26 - now here's what i feel like actually
16:28 - needs to happen
16:29 - i kind of need to learn how to switch it
16:31 - on and off and that's something i
16:32 - haven't
16:33 - learned yet
16:36 - and the alter ego has helped me achieve
16:39 - a lot of things right so the
16:40 - the whole thing about being a one man
16:42 - army
16:44 - now it's a mind [ __ ] between alter ego
16:47 - and like non-alter ego right so when i
16:50 - even say that think when i say alter ego
16:52 - think michael jordan
16:53 - when i say non-alter ego maybe think
16:56 - bill gates
17:00 - michael jordan was the type of leader
17:02 - that just put in so much [ __ ] work
17:04 - and worked so hard that he made you want
17:07 - to step up
17:09 - and if you didn't want to step up he
17:10 - would just tell you get the [ __ ] out of
17:12 - here
17:12 - steve jobs was also a alter alter ego
17:15 - based leader
17:16 - where a lot of people said he was not a
17:18 - nice person he was an [ __ ]
17:21 - and he also created a distortion field
17:24 - but
17:24 - they didn't like him that much now i
17:27 - don't think there's anything wrong with
17:28 - being a leader like that by the way like
17:30 - if you are
17:31 - if you have to get stuff done like it's
17:33 - remarkable today i have an iphone
17:35 - it wouldn't have happened if steve jobs
17:37 - didn't like follow through on his
17:38 - mission
17:40 - but then on the other side you have
17:41 - non-alter ego based leader
17:43 - or i what i just call ego leader
17:47 - is like martin luther king and
17:51 - martin luther king this guy is not
17:55 - he's working hard to develop other
17:57 - people into leaders
18:00 - but he's not trying to out not just by
18:03 - purely outworking them right
18:04 - he's actually just coaching them and
18:06 - guiding them to become better like
18:07 - mahatma gandhi is an ego based leader he
18:10 - truly sacrificed himself to grow others
18:13 - and i feel like an elon musk is a
18:15 - alter ego based leader where he's like
18:17 - yo i'll actually sometimes put my desk
18:19 - in the middle of everybody so everybody
18:21 - can watch me
18:22 - outwork everybody else so
18:26 - both are good ways how do you want to be
18:28 - remembered i don't want to be remembered
18:30 - like that i want to be remembered like
18:31 - somebody who
18:33 - you know like who gave up things for the
18:37 - people and who
18:37 - cared for the people and who
18:41 - yeah like to me the legacy of it really
18:44 - matters
18:45 - and i don't know maybe i don't have as a
18:48 - big enough of a purpose as elon musk
18:50 - that's
18:51 - also possible um but i
18:54 - care more about the people and i feel
18:56 - like instead of sometimes even being
18:58 - right
18:59 - we should do right now
19:03 - is this something you have figured out
19:04 - how to actually deal with
19:06 - and if you have i would actually love to
19:08 - know if you guys would drop that in the
19:10 - comments
19:11 - like what is the balance between being a
19:13 - leader versus somebody who makes you
19:14 - feel like you're always in their shadow
19:19 - and and this is another thing i wrote on
19:22 - alter ego and alter ego basically goes
19:24 - like
19:24 - i got me here i put in the hard work
19:28 - years and years of belief work vision
19:30 - commitment to my dreams and a relentless
19:32 - work ethic
19:34 - nobody's opinion [ __ ] matters not
19:37 - even the people who are on this live
19:38 - stream
19:38 - not even the people who are [ __ ]
19:40 - commenting not even the people who have
19:41 - been there and cared every single day
19:43 - nobody's opinion matters
19:46 - if i had to do it all over again from
19:48 - scratch i will
19:49 - clever programmer died the youtube
19:51 - channel went away instagram channel went
19:53 - away
19:54 - every single student went away every
19:56 - single customer went away
19:58 - i will build it again
20:01 - i'm never gonna give up if they can't
20:05 - keep
20:05 - up they can leave
20:09 - michael jordan did that to his team in
20:11 - the book relentless
20:13 - tim grover talks about it
20:16 - they all hated him but everyone stepped
20:18 - up
20:20 - steve jobs did that too
20:24 - now on the non-alter ego side
20:28 - i want to work hard to develop leaders
20:29 - on the team even if it means
20:31 - some of my things get sacrificed
20:35 - everyone on the team has more potential
20:37 - than me
20:38 - and i want to work my face off to bring
20:40 - that out with care
20:41 - and a [ __ ] ton of empathy
20:46 - human beings are the ultimate asset
20:49 - my team doesn't serve me i serve them
20:53 - you guys watching this video don't serve
20:55 - me i serve you
20:59 - everybody needs to be treated fairly and
21:01 - equally don't be
21:02 - right do right
21:06 - now i want to ask you guys is it fair
21:09 - are both ways
21:12 - of looking at life fair what do you
21:16 - think
21:28 - let's see
21:31 - a servant leader i'm better with my
21:34 - alter ego too
21:37 - pretty anxious says frank says what do
21:39 - you think of other youtubers like nick
21:41 - white
21:42 - nothing bad i think they're just doing
21:44 - what they need to do
21:46 - um even the negative video he made on me
21:49 - like no harm i feel like
21:54 - if it helped him grow his channel then
21:56 - great
21:57 - like so now those are the two sides
22:00 - right the alter ego versus the
22:02 - ego side the alter ego is like it's
22:04 - probably not right we should swim for
22:06 - defamation
22:08 - the ego side is he's also a human being
22:12 - he doesn't know me that much he saw an
22:15 - ad he made a video on it and he moved on
22:19 - and it grew his channel so maybe in some
22:21 - way i
22:22 - helped him and
22:25 - he just grew and you know maybe because
22:27 - of that video people are finding out
22:29 - about clever programmer
22:30 - and maybe at some point they realize oh
22:32 - yo there's actually good stuff
22:35 - alter ego versus ego
22:45 - so yeah so this is what i yeah i think
22:49 - so trevitti says i think ego can be
22:50 - beneficial in certain situations but in
22:52 - most cases overall i think alter ego
22:54 - slash empathy and relationship is the
22:56 - way to go
22:57 - okay the point i was yeah so i think
22:59 - you're you're right on
23:00 - i understand what you're saying but on
23:02 - the alter ego side i kind of was saying
23:04 - that that's the devil that's what i was
23:05 - calling the devil
23:09 - atharva says i saw your comment on nick
23:12 - white video
23:13 - you were a lot polite to him yeah cause
23:15 - like
23:16 - look i can be right but i wanna do right
23:20 - right like five or ten years from now
23:22 - i don't want to even say anything to him
23:24 - that
23:25 - like i just i don't feel
23:28 - a crazy personal attack right and so
23:33 - to me he's producing content he's trying
23:36 - to help people
23:37 - and that's great you know how many
23:40 - people i'd rather have somebody trying
23:42 - to create content than not create
23:43 - content right so
23:45 - it is what it is
23:52 - few faces i think it's all a matter of
23:54 - interpretation anything can be a good
23:56 - thing or a bad thing like a tool
24:07 - so yeah so basically i thought okay both
24:09 - of these are fair ways of looking
24:11 - at life right now which one is better
24:16 - in your opinion would you say
24:21 - you guys probably can't read it but
24:22 - would you say alter ego is better like
24:24 - your devil
24:26 - or ego is better your angel
24:30 - and i don't want you to give me a
24:32 - [ __ ] answer
24:34 - just because like angel sounds better
24:37 - but like ego leaders right where mahatma
24:39 - gandhi martin luther king bill gates
24:41 - in my opinion and alter ego leaders i
24:43 - felt like were michael jordan steve jobs
24:45 - elon musk
24:49 - right alter ego leaders are just very
24:50 - driven by their own vision to the point
24:52 - where they kind of don't care about
24:53 - people
24:54 - ego leaders are driven by the people so
24:57 - much so that they
24:58 - like you know care more about them than
25:00 - almost anything else
25:06 - atharva says alter ego
25:10 - java p says i landed a job okay
25:14 - if it's true just send me an instagram
25:16 - message with proof
25:20 - a huge says i want to be a future
25:21 - content creator and you are my
25:23 - inspiration
25:24 - thank you bro minix says you landed me a
25:27 - freaking awesome
25:28 - job man and flipping 17 hey nice bro
25:34 - short film says alter ego gives you more
25:36 - power
25:37 - el manana says ego
25:42 - okay nice
25:45 - yeah guys you're gonna get blocked just
25:47 - don't spam the chat
25:50 - therma is on it prion shoes on it too
25:53 - there's
25:53 - they're racing against each other um
26:00 - yeah so few phase says it doesn't need
26:02 - to be either or we need to be able to
26:04 - turn
26:04 - one each one whenever it's necessary
26:10 - trivedi says brother i think we all look
26:12 - at all things these are black and white
26:14 - but it is so much more complex and
26:16 - interconnected with each other and
26:17 - that's just being a human being
26:20 - so you see yeah i think that's where the
26:22 - answer lies i think that's
26:24 - beautiful what you guys are saying i
26:25 - think it's a balance and i think it's
26:27 - just how you
26:29 - want to live your life and how you want
26:30 - to be remembered but i think that
26:32 - balance kind of never ends
26:39 - yeah and that's what i wrote too on my
26:41 - instagram story that day and i was like
26:43 - i imagine should i read it like this
26:49 - looks good on camera
26:53 - i basically said i imagine the right
26:55 - answer is a mixture of both
26:56 - but that's so much goddamn easier said
26:59 - than done
27:01 - for me i said ultimately i want to be i
27:04 - want to develop
27:05 - leaders and be a servant leader i want
27:07 - to be an ego beast
27:08 - uh ego based leader
27:11 - but i really don't want to lose the
27:13 - alter ego side of me that goes really
27:16 - hard
27:16 - and so that's the balance that gets
27:18 - tricky
27:20 - and that's the side of me that comes out
27:22 - and protecting my team so alter ego side
27:24 - is what comes out
27:25 - when it's time to protect my team when
27:27 - i'm fighting or training and doing
27:29 - really hard things
27:30 - and when you know stuff hits the fan and
27:32 - i gotta make some serious decisions
27:34 - that's when i'm like
27:35 - boom the other quasi right the quasi
27:37 - that's not on youtube a lot
27:39 - the kazoo on youtube is just the
27:43 - nice causey fun causey hype good hype
27:46 - good energy
27:48 - but you know like
27:51 - there's not a lot of times i have to
27:53 - fight people on youtube you know so it's
27:54 - like
27:57 - yeah and then it started great
27:58 - conversations on the ig story so i'm
28:00 - just gonna kind of skip
28:02 - um skip over them
28:08 - let's see
28:11 - yeah and then i think that that was kind
28:14 - of
28:17 - that was the end of that thought that i
28:20 - had at least for that day
28:23 - let me go back
28:29 - and then yeah like the the text thread
28:31 - is great i'm just seeing
28:35 - so a few things that it started off with
28:37 - then i started having a conversation
28:38 - with logan who also comes on this
28:39 - channel actually quite a bit on youtube
28:41 - and he'll be here
28:43 - a bunch and i started talking with logan
28:46 - um
28:54 - and logan was like i can't say i've been
28:56 - in that position myself but he goes the
28:57 - leaders i've had and loved were always
29:00 - exceptional
29:00 - at recognizing people's strengths and
29:03 - allowing
29:04 - them to explore those traits themselves
29:07 - while also being capable of kind and
29:08 - direct conversation exposing weakness
29:10 - and their technical craft
29:13 - and what i was talking to logan about as
29:15 - well is i said
29:18 - before when i didn't have a team when i
29:21 - didn't have a lot of
29:22 - students i didn't have the people on
29:25 - youtube i didn't have you guys i didn't
29:27 - have
29:27 - customers in pwj or profit with python
29:33 - 80 to 90 of the focus was just me right
29:36 - what do i need to learn what do i need
29:38 - to cause like one of the
29:39 - problems i've been having recently is
29:42 - a lot of my time is spent making content
29:44 - here on youtube
29:46 - a lot of my time is spent with the
29:47 - community of pwj
29:49 - a lot of my time is spent with the team
29:52 - and so the thing that was getting
29:53 - neglected oftentimes was my own learning
29:55 - because i miss learning
29:57 - learning is what got me here i used to
30:00 - learn for
30:01 - 10 to 15 hours a day and
30:04 - i personally started feeling like man
30:06 - i'm not learning
30:08 - as much as i used to be able to and i
30:11 - miss
30:11 - that feeling and i don't want to like to
30:14 - be honest like
30:16 - being an expert is cool but like i just
30:18 - miss
30:19 - being a learner and then just sharing
30:21 - insights with you guys that's how i was
30:23 - when i was growing clever programmers
30:24 - just like i would learn something and
30:25 - just share and i was like
30:26 - whoa learn and share it
30:30 - and so there's that other part of the
30:33 - ego that comes in that's like well now
30:35 - i'm an expert
30:36 - and so now i don't learn i just like
30:38 - share stuff
30:39 - but then you kind of start sounding like
30:41 - a broken record and i like to
30:43 - have my own learning going at all times
30:47 - and sometimes it's at
30:50 - odds with what other things i'm doing
30:51 - because if i'm learning
30:54 - and fulfilling what i want to do for my
30:56 - brain then oftentimes i'm actually not
30:58 - either developing team members
31:00 - or providing content for
31:04 - the people if that makes sense
31:11 - mindlean says don't you think it's based
31:12 - on the situation of the person to the
31:14 - situation where mahatma gandhi was and
31:16 - where elon musk is totally different so
31:17 - i say it's based on situation
31:21 - i mean i'm sure but yeah
31:24 - but like still i feel like he's his goal
31:28 - was different
31:28 - and his leadership style was different
31:30 - right like there was a difference
31:32 - between malcolm x and martin luther king
31:34 - even though they had similar goals and
31:36 - they were around similar times
31:38 - malcolm x and martin luther king was
31:40 - like yo
31:41 - no violence at any cost right malcolm x
31:44 - was still a great leader but i think
31:46 - there were times where that kind of
31:48 - happened i don't know i'm not really
31:50 - good that good at history by the way so
31:51 - i could just be making stuff up
31:58 - author says you guys took the efforts
32:01 - pretty much just says we pwg
32:02 - students are here for you and your but
32:04 - uh and you're bad in your good times
32:05 - thank you bro like i appreciate that
32:07 - that's huge
32:12 - so
32:15 - and i think you know it's a balance
32:18 - of admiration from other people versus
32:22 - admiration
32:22 - from yourself because sometimes if
32:25 - you're just working really hard on other
32:27 - people
32:28 - they will give you admiration but
32:31 - or you're like hey do i get at um should
32:34 - i have admiration for this so for
32:35 - example
32:36 - let's say i'm putting out non-stop
32:38 - content on youtube right
32:40 - and just teaching insane amount of
32:42 - concepts
32:43 - it's fun it's uh it's fulfilling too
32:46 - don't get me wrong i enjoy it we all
32:48 - enjoy it
32:50 - but you will respond to me and you will
32:52 - be like yo
32:53 - quasi you're like awesome bro like
32:56 - you're putting out so much content
32:57 - you're helping people and you might feel
32:59 - like that
33:00 - now on the other hand what if that same
33:02 - day
33:03 - i didn't hit the gym
33:07 - what if that same day i
33:10 - didn't learn
33:14 - do i have the same amount of admiration
33:17 - for myself and i have to
33:20 - you know you know what i mean so it's
33:22 - like i can get admiration from you but
33:24 - then there's this other part of
33:25 - admiration from myself
33:27 - too and i think those are also things
33:30 - that
33:32 - you can definitely everything has a
33:34 - solution so i don't want any of this
33:36 - that comes off like
33:37 - i know some people in the comments are
33:38 - like college you have like low energy
33:39 - man you're sad like we're here for you
33:41 - guys i'm not sad i don't have long
33:43 - energy i'm just like being reflective
33:45 - and there's always a solution for
33:48 - example
33:50 - i can probably just go hard in the
33:51 - morning and have morning time to learn
33:54 - and to train really hard and then the
33:56 - rest of the day i can
33:57 - focus on producing content and then
33:59 - evening i can like actually reflect
34:01 - that's very very possible it comes down
34:04 - to being effective
34:05 - and having good time management right
34:08 - and
34:10 - it might be easy for me to look into
34:11 - your life and be like boom that's the
34:13 - answer
34:15 - but when you look at your own life it's
34:16 - a little bit harder to
34:18 - you know like it's weird it's like
34:20 - harder to balance certain things out
34:38 - so so yeah those were a few of the
34:40 - things that were on my mind
34:42 - and um
34:53 - i'm just going through the text thread
34:56 - that we had
35:01 - right and pretty much ultimately like i
35:03 - started having a conversation with a
35:04 - bunch of people at that time on
35:06 - instagram and we were going
35:07 - really deep into it but ultimately i
35:10 - just
35:10 - came to
35:14 - that balance is not gonna go away but in
35:16 - order to feed
35:18 - your own thing i call it like take the
35:19 - devil out for a walk
35:22 - so take your alter ego out for a walk
35:24 - every single day because i think of
35:26 - people like dwayne johnson the rock
35:28 - i think of people like joe rogan how are
35:30 - these people
35:32 - they're animals right but then at the
35:34 - same time they're very
35:35 - calm and loving to people and
35:38 - caring and mild tempered and
35:42 - they don't have these random they don't
35:44 - get frustrated and have these random
35:46 - things
35:46 - happen right
35:51 - it made me realize
35:56 - you need to have good outlets to let
35:58 - that devil out for a walk
36:01 - if you don't it's going to come out in
36:03 - other weird ways it's going to come out
36:04 - on your own
36:05 - people on your own team members but
36:08 - maybe in the mornings
36:09 - for me what it means is having
36:11 - disciplined time
36:12 - to work out to learn to maybe even get
36:16 - on these podcast
36:17 - style of videos and share because i get
36:20 - a lot of insight from you guys as well
36:24 - and that can be like my growing time
36:27 - and then after that it's like sharing
36:30 - you know the things that
36:31 - um
36:35 - yeah just sharing the things that i've
36:36 - picked up on so maybe for you
36:39 - what does that mean maybe for you it
36:41 - means
36:43 - you know what what are you feeling like
36:45 - do you feel like you're giving yourself
36:46 - enough time or are you always just
36:48 - giving other people time and doing
36:50 - things for other people
36:52 - if you are not then maybe you need to
36:54 - have just a very
36:55 - strict disciplined thing in the morning
36:58 - where that's your time and it's
36:59 - untouchable
37:00 - no communication no contact just you
37:03 - focused on you
37:04 - doing your thing for maybe three four
37:06 - five hours for me
37:08 - sometimes it also means waking up as
37:10 - early as four a.m if i have to
37:13 - because if it's important to me i'll
37:14 - i'll do it
37:16 - and if four to seven or four to eight
37:19 - they're like four hours where i can just
37:20 - go hard and like learn and reflect
37:23 - and you know lift and do kickboxing or
37:27 - whatever it is
37:28 - i think i will be so freaking happy with
37:31 - myself like
37:32 - that gives me admiration from me because
37:35 - i'm learning and training
37:36 - sharpening my sword right and then the
37:38 - rest of the day i can help other people
37:40 - sharpen theirs and that would be just
37:42 - clean balance
37:49 - ajit says bro whenever i get demotivated
37:52 - i watch your videos and this will help
37:53 - me to boosting my development
37:54 - hell yeah i thought it says if you smell
37:57 - what the rock
37:59 - is cooking
38:03 - damn we got deep on this one boys
38:07 - and girls there's a lot
38:13 - but bradley knox says interestingly i
38:16 - give myself way too much time trying to
38:18 - become a very well skilled developer to
38:20 - the point that i don't spend time with
38:21 - my children enough
38:22 - but i'm on a time limit and my burn rate
38:24 - is high
38:26 - so there's that few faces i'm quite the
38:29 - opposite i can hit the gym every single
38:31 - day but bringing myself to code that's
38:33 - the hard thing
38:36 - that's what i'm saying it's whatever
38:37 - mode you're in right like i
38:39 - will tell you that i was going
38:42 - hard at the gym last year
38:46 - so hard i was training six to eight
38:48 - hours a day in the morning i would
38:50 - have a power lifting session so i'm
38:52 - doing my deadlifts my squats my overhead
38:54 - presses
38:55 - and i was getting heavy on them for my
38:57 - body weight
39:00 - um i
39:03 - got so i would do that then in the
39:06 - afternoon i would go
39:07 - and run and i would do
39:10 - a lot of cardio i would do kickboxing
39:13 - and then at night time then i would go
39:15 - at seven or eight pm
39:17 - drive one and a half hour just one way
39:20 - to a jiu jitsu gym it was eddie bravo's
39:22 - jiu jitsu gym
39:24 - i think planet ten planet tenth planet
39:27 - right ten planet jiu jitsu
39:28 - i would go there and i would train and
39:32 - i'm learning all this like crazy [ __ ]
39:33 - like the
39:34 - the the leg locks and
39:37 - all this you know they're more focused
39:39 - actually on leg locks and even like
39:40 - guillotine
39:41 - or some of the other stuff which is
39:42 - super cool and it's really practical so
39:45 - i'm like learning that and i love their
39:47 - nogi
39:47 - like that's so much i hate wearing the
39:50 - freaking ghee and you know putting that
39:51 - on
39:52 - i just love like the nogi so i would
39:54 - train
39:55 - uh jiu jitsu for one or two hours
39:59 - and i was effectively training for a
40:02 - total of seven to eight hours a day and
40:04 - i was enjoying it then i would come back
40:05 - and all i would do is watch jiu jitsu
40:08 - on my tv till i just crashed and knocked
40:10 - out right and then woke up the next day
40:13 - and then i would just repeat rinse and
40:14 - repeat rinse and repeat
40:17 - so really good at mastering something
40:20 - and then just immersing and doing it and
40:22 - just going all out
40:24 - hot really bad at like
40:27 - like a little of this today a little of
40:29 - this look that balance
40:30 - it just something i have to keep working
40:36 - on
40:51 - sueta says let's see
40:55 - mac talk if someone wants to go for web
40:57 - development in future what tech would
40:59 - you recommend to learn apart from react
41:06 - i mean you
41:10 - will need to know a few things so i'd
41:11 - recommend learning firebase
41:13 - so you can actually host your app and
41:15 - have a database i would recommend
41:18 - learning
41:20 - node node.js i would recommend learning
41:24 - about
41:24 - apis i would recommend learning about
41:28 - microservices whether you learn it

Cleaned transcript:

what's up guys how are you guys doing this is qazi from cleverprogrammer.com super amazing to get started this early in the morning it's actually what time is it it's 7 25 a.m for this live stream pacific so if you're in chicago or in you're in new york i think it'll be it'll be a little bit later right and then if you are in michigan it should be about 10 something a.m 10 25 a.m and yeah just let me know where you guys coming in from are you guys coming in is anybody here from new york or chicago welcome guys so today guys i want to talk about alter ego and productivity i think this is very important for developers for people in general i mean i just call the developers at the end because i think it makes it relevant to everybody but this is something that has been on top of my mind for a while we got people from mexico fortune from dallas from hungary nice switzerland ruth aye alexander mexico killed london let's go in a ukraine melbourne berkeley hungary nepal nice you guys awesome so keep the chat clean guys if anybody is uh doing anything more than once just block them don't even give a warning so it just keeps it clean now this is something i've been thinking about for the last few days and it's something that's been on top of my mind and it's something i want to share with everybody i hope it brings you value but one thing that i've been realizing is as my time gets tighter and tighter and there are more challenges and restrictions and responsibilities that i have to face what i get left with is a lot of competing priorities that need to fit in a 24hour time span probably resonates with a lot of you but the problem comes in is when you feel like you cannot fill that 24hour time span with all of the things that you actually want to do and so you sometimes get in this cycle of damn am i doing enough do i need to do more and just sometimes like not being as effective as you can be and so for me yo what's up corey how you doing yeah i think gigi ball asks are you an introvert yeah i think i'm an introvert who has developed the capabilities to be an extrovert when i need to be but i think like i just i prefer probably being an introvert more and so i started this off with my instagram stories and i started just like writing out my thoughts at night and i just shared them with with people in general and then like these thoughts that i had shared started getting a ton of engagement from the people and so i thought it might be a good thing to do a video on it might just bring value to everybody so started off with me just kind of realizing i was like time to admit it i haven't been doing what i need to be doing so one area of my life that i've been really lacking in is working out hard and i haven't been doing that i kept using corona as an excuse and i would always say i'll just train once the gyms open up it'll be fine for now i'll just focus on clever programmer the truth is i haven't done [ __ ] all i was watching my content from a year and a half ago and i saw myself and i was becoming a [ __ ] monster i was fast powerful i was quick and explosive i was like training lifting hard in the gym i was doing kickboxing i was doing jiu jitsu there were so many things that i was doing i was rapidly improving in boxing strength and speed was on my [ __ ] and going hard and i feel like that's kind of what made me who i am today right even if i look back in 2017 i was waking up oftentimes at 5 5 30 a.m i would go lift really hard then i would go and like read books and learn and then i would go and do other things now one reason i feel like i haven't been physically doing a lot of training is because i miss lifting weights i don't know if this you guys ever feel that i know some people like body weights but for me it's like body weight just doesn't do the trick for me and i don't really enjoy it as much as getting on a heavy like deadlift or a squat i also like love hitting hard so whether i'm doing boxing or kickboxing just the feeling of like you got something there to hit on like that's a good feeling whereas shadowboxing is not that fun it's cool but again all excuses however those things did stop me now a few things that even if it comes to the parallel that i can draw for you between me training my body and new training maybe coding is there are a few things that i say that i think could be really relevant to you right so for me one i'm gonna start off by having some solutions so one of the solution that i decided to come up with is finding places that are open to work out that have that equipment which not many places to set up speakers upstairs in my house so i can blast music and get equipment in my house as well so change for me that means like changing my environment and sometimes even if you want to code or you're trying to work on something changing the your environment can help number three i said neural rewiring and what i meant by is record and watch myself train every single night recording an ungodly amount of instagram stories and then watching myself train when i'm going to sleep that is going to keep rewiring my brain and keep me mentally sharp lifting and working out and kickboxing that was stuff i never wanted to do i had to develop the habit of it by recording myself through literally doing instagram stories by the end of the day i would have these tiny little dots at the top and then what i would do is i would just tap through them at night before i'd be going to sleep and i would watch myself working out the beauty of that was i felt primed when i woke up the next day i felt like a lion just ready to go and i would just boom if you documented your journey of becoming a developer and you wrote things and you took stories of yourself coding even whether it's time lapses or photos or just you coding and you watched it at night i promise that would rewire you to want to code the next day as well and number five or number four was immersion for me which was i had to force myself to break out of the pattern of watching dumb garbage at night so i have this habit of watching chess i love chess absolutely love it so every single night i've been watching chess you know every time i'm about to go to sleep every time i have any down time like if i have to wait one second for you like literally if you and i were hanging out you're like bro i'm gonna go grab a bottle of water if we're talking i'll be chatting with you what's up bro how you doing like hey but if there was like one second or you're like bro i'm gonna go and grab a drink you know i'm gonna go and i'm gonna hit the restroom and i'll be right back i will open up chess and i will play a speed chess game of like two minutes right one minute bullet chess so that was my pat i was watching all the stuff at night and so i thought okay i need to replace that with something that's entertaining so i still feel like i'm snacking and it's fun but it's instead the things that i want my life to look like right so for example chess is not gonna really help my lifestyle even though i enjoy it but what i started watching was i started watching like max tuning's vlogs on fitness and that was basically a really good thing for immersion for me which was just it immersed me in the world of fitness so hmm okay that is annoying somebody just keeps like sending me the same message again and again and again and again on my instagram so it just keeps buzzing my phone and literally like sir can you please fix my header.js header.js file just copy it and just pasting it pasting it enter enter like if they did it maybe 700 times that would get my attention and maybe i'd help out but anyways so i thought okay immersion so let me immerse myself in things that can improve my life that meant for me watching tick tocks instagram content or youtube content stuff that i was going to do anyway but now i want it to be designed to actually change my behavior to do the thing that i want to do i remember when i used to want to code more i would watch crazy amount of content on coding all the time nonstop and i would try to find entertaining content so i could watch it before i would be sleeping so yeah that was that was the part of immersion that i wanted to do now i want to talk about like alter ego i'm breaking it down with alter ego and then ego okay so that's two things so alter ego being your devil right and then ego being your angel side so they're not technically correct terms i'm sure somebody the psychologist will be like no you're talking about ig ego and your id or some weird stuff like that that's okay that's just how i'm defining them so just follow along with me and hopefully it'll give some perspective so i'm i wrote here i'm like i have a very powerful alter ego it's what makes me deeply want to outwork everyone's face and prove them wrong which also makes me an [ __ ] seem arrogant offend people i've had to learn a lot i have had to learn to let a lot of it go in order to become a better leader the pro of subduing my alter ego i wrote is made me a better leader less threatening polite inclusive empathetic emotional caring loving understanding introspective and develop other leaders so focusing so much on that side of me um but yeah so by letting kind of go of my alter you go the thing that drove me so i remember back in 2017 i was just like go like qazi like you're the best like i had so many things that i would actually say that i kind of cringe and saying right now but i'm like nobody can [ __ ] outwork me my work is the best work like i will work your face like i will outwork you when it comes to coding like i will make something better than you can i will outlift you i will like pretty much anything you can think of i would tell myself and because i was a oneman army i really needed that part of me to be alive like kind of that animalistic part right where when fight or flight kicks in you go in this place you go in this mode we all have that place you don't all you're not always there but what about like when it comes to protecting somebody in your family or there's something there's somebody disrespects somebody that you care about right we all have that like animalistic mode i used a lot of that to initially build myself up and to grow my channel and to put in the work and to do coding and you know to be able to do the 15 to 16 hours a day of work now that was the positive side of letting my alter ego go which was you know becoming a better leader more empathetic does that kind of make sense i hope so looking in the chat frank says why low on energy no i'm just it's just a morning bro and i'm just chilling by myself so no really reason to be crazy high energy but you know i can be but not i'm just i'm kind of in my deep reflective mode which you know i'm actually kind of like this one i'm just thinking i'm by myself like i'm thinking i'm not always like yo what's up guys like you know like i'm not sitting like normally by myself doing that so okay all right so all right anyways now the con of it i felt like was it made me uh soft never outworking or outshining anyone and literally even in the yeah like sometimes i was even telling the team i'm like guys sometimes i literally don't go into team meetings because i feel like when i go there it scares the people or they don't want to talk a lot so when i'm there i'm actually genuinely sometimes not trying to share ideas which is my fault right and me not having me not have a good communication skills but i'm like i don't want to outshine anybody and then i would feel like some of the team members would get quiet or they maybe felt intimidated or something so those are the cons but then i don't get to sharpen my sword right if i'm helping a lot of other people sharpen their sword and maybe if you feel like that you're helping a lot of other people sharpen their sword it won't actually help you that much sometimes and so i felt that the biggest pro and the biggest con of killing give me one second so yeah i felt like the biggest problem the biggest con of killing my alter ego in one sentence was i can develop leaders at my expense now here's what i feel like actually needs to happen i kind of need to learn how to switch it on and off and that's something i haven't learned yet and the alter ego has helped me achieve a lot of things right so the the whole thing about being a one man army now it's a mind [ __ ] between alter ego and like nonalter ego right so when i even say that think when i say alter ego think michael jordan when i say nonalter ego maybe think bill gates michael jordan was the type of leader that just put in so much [ __ ] work and worked so hard that he made you want to step up and if you didn't want to step up he would just tell you get the [ __ ] out of here steve jobs was also a alter alter ego based leader where a lot of people said he was not a nice person he was an [ __ ] and he also created a distortion field but they didn't like him that much now i don't think there's anything wrong with being a leader like that by the way like if you are if you have to get stuff done like it's remarkable today i have an iphone it wouldn't have happened if steve jobs didn't like follow through on his mission but then on the other side you have nonalter ego based leader or i what i just call ego leader is like martin luther king and martin luther king this guy is not he's working hard to develop other people into leaders but he's not trying to out not just by purely outworking them right he's actually just coaching them and guiding them to become better like mahatma gandhi is an ego based leader he truly sacrificed himself to grow others and i feel like an elon musk is a alter ego based leader where he's like yo i'll actually sometimes put my desk in the middle of everybody so everybody can watch me outwork everybody else so both are good ways how do you want to be remembered i don't want to be remembered like that i want to be remembered like somebody who you know like who gave up things for the people and who cared for the people and who yeah like to me the legacy of it really matters and i don't know maybe i don't have as a big enough of a purpose as elon musk that's also possible um but i care more about the people and i feel like instead of sometimes even being right we should do right now is this something you have figured out how to actually deal with and if you have i would actually love to know if you guys would drop that in the comments like what is the balance between being a leader versus somebody who makes you feel like you're always in their shadow and and this is another thing i wrote on alter ego and alter ego basically goes like i got me here i put in the hard work years and years of belief work vision commitment to my dreams and a relentless work ethic nobody's opinion [ __ ] matters not even the people who are on this live stream not even the people who are [ __ ] commenting not even the people who have been there and cared every single day nobody's opinion matters if i had to do it all over again from scratch i will clever programmer died the youtube channel went away instagram channel went away every single student went away every single customer went away i will build it again i'm never gonna give up if they can't keep up they can leave michael jordan did that to his team in the book relentless tim grover talks about it they all hated him but everyone stepped up steve jobs did that too now on the nonalter ego side i want to work hard to develop leaders on the team even if it means some of my things get sacrificed everyone on the team has more potential than me and i want to work my face off to bring that out with care and a [ __ ] ton of empathy human beings are the ultimate asset my team doesn't serve me i serve them you guys watching this video don't serve me i serve you everybody needs to be treated fairly and equally don't be right do right now i want to ask you guys is it fair are both ways of looking at life fair what do you think let's see a servant leader i'm better with my alter ego too pretty anxious says frank says what do you think of other youtubers like nick white nothing bad i think they're just doing what they need to do um even the negative video he made on me like no harm i feel like if it helped him grow his channel then great like so now those are the two sides right the alter ego versus the ego side the alter ego is like it's probably not right we should swim for defamation the ego side is he's also a human being he doesn't know me that much he saw an ad he made a video on it and he moved on and it grew his channel so maybe in some way i helped him and he just grew and you know maybe because of that video people are finding out about clever programmer and maybe at some point they realize oh yo there's actually good stuff alter ego versus ego so yeah so this is what i yeah i think so trevitti says i think ego can be beneficial in certain situations but in most cases overall i think alter ego slash empathy and relationship is the way to go okay the point i was yeah so i think you're you're right on i understand what you're saying but on the alter ego side i kind of was saying that that's the devil that's what i was calling the devil atharva says i saw your comment on nick white video you were a lot polite to him yeah cause like look i can be right but i wanna do right right like five or ten years from now i don't want to even say anything to him that like i just i don't feel a crazy personal attack right and so to me he's producing content he's trying to help people and that's great you know how many people i'd rather have somebody trying to create content than not create content right so it is what it is few faces i think it's all a matter of interpretation anything can be a good thing or a bad thing like a tool so yeah so basically i thought okay both of these are fair ways of looking at life right now which one is better in your opinion would you say you guys probably can't read it but would you say alter ego is better like your devil or ego is better your angel and i don't want you to give me a [ __ ] answer just because like angel sounds better but like ego leaders right where mahatma gandhi martin luther king bill gates in my opinion and alter ego leaders i felt like were michael jordan steve jobs elon musk right alter ego leaders are just very driven by their own vision to the point where they kind of don't care about people ego leaders are driven by the people so much so that they like you know care more about them than almost anything else atharva says alter ego java p says i landed a job okay if it's true just send me an instagram message with proof a huge says i want to be a future content creator and you are my inspiration thank you bro minix says you landed me a freaking awesome job man and flipping 17 hey nice bro short film says alter ego gives you more power el manana says ego okay nice yeah guys you're gonna get blocked just don't spam the chat therma is on it prion shoes on it too there's they're racing against each other um yeah so few phase says it doesn't need to be either or we need to be able to turn one each one whenever it's necessary trivedi says brother i think we all look at all things these are black and white but it is so much more complex and interconnected with each other and that's just being a human being so you see yeah i think that's where the answer lies i think that's beautiful what you guys are saying i think it's a balance and i think it's just how you want to live your life and how you want to be remembered but i think that balance kind of never ends yeah and that's what i wrote too on my instagram story that day and i was like i imagine should i read it like this looks good on camera i basically said i imagine the right answer is a mixture of both but that's so much goddamn easier said than done for me i said ultimately i want to be i want to develop leaders and be a servant leader i want to be an ego beast uh ego based leader but i really don't want to lose the alter ego side of me that goes really hard and so that's the balance that gets tricky and that's the side of me that comes out and protecting my team so alter ego side is what comes out when it's time to protect my team when i'm fighting or training and doing really hard things and when you know stuff hits the fan and i gotta make some serious decisions that's when i'm like boom the other quasi right the quasi that's not on youtube a lot the kazoo on youtube is just the nice causey fun causey hype good hype good energy but you know like there's not a lot of times i have to fight people on youtube you know so it's like yeah and then it started great conversations on the ig story so i'm just gonna kind of skip um skip over them let's see yeah and then i think that that was kind of that was the end of that thought that i had at least for that day let me go back and then yeah like the the text thread is great i'm just seeing so a few things that it started off with then i started having a conversation with logan who also comes on this channel actually quite a bit on youtube and he'll be here a bunch and i started talking with logan um and logan was like i can't say i've been in that position myself but he goes the leaders i've had and loved were always exceptional at recognizing people's strengths and allowing them to explore those traits themselves while also being capable of kind and direct conversation exposing weakness and their technical craft and what i was talking to logan about as well is i said before when i didn't have a team when i didn't have a lot of students i didn't have the people on youtube i didn't have you guys i didn't have customers in pwj or profit with python 80 to 90 of the focus was just me right what do i need to learn what do i need to cause like one of the problems i've been having recently is a lot of my time is spent making content here on youtube a lot of my time is spent with the community of pwj a lot of my time is spent with the team and so the thing that was getting neglected oftentimes was my own learning because i miss learning learning is what got me here i used to learn for 10 to 15 hours a day and i personally started feeling like man i'm not learning as much as i used to be able to and i miss that feeling and i don't want to like to be honest like being an expert is cool but like i just miss being a learner and then just sharing insights with you guys that's how i was when i was growing clever programmers just like i would learn something and just share and i was like whoa learn and share it and so there's that other part of the ego that comes in that's like well now i'm an expert and so now i don't learn i just like share stuff but then you kind of start sounding like a broken record and i like to have my own learning going at all times and sometimes it's at odds with what other things i'm doing because if i'm learning and fulfilling what i want to do for my brain then oftentimes i'm actually not either developing team members or providing content for the people if that makes sense mindlean says don't you think it's based on the situation of the person to the situation where mahatma gandhi was and where elon musk is totally different so i say it's based on situation i mean i'm sure but yeah but like still i feel like he's his goal was different and his leadership style was different right like there was a difference between malcolm x and martin luther king even though they had similar goals and they were around similar times malcolm x and martin luther king was like yo no violence at any cost right malcolm x was still a great leader but i think there were times where that kind of happened i don't know i'm not really good that good at history by the way so i could just be making stuff up author says you guys took the efforts pretty much just says we pwg students are here for you and your but uh and you're bad in your good times thank you bro like i appreciate that that's huge so and i think you know it's a balance of admiration from other people versus admiration from yourself because sometimes if you're just working really hard on other people they will give you admiration but or you're like hey do i get at um should i have admiration for this so for example let's say i'm putting out nonstop content on youtube right and just teaching insane amount of concepts it's fun it's uh it's fulfilling too don't get me wrong i enjoy it we all enjoy it but you will respond to me and you will be like yo quasi you're like awesome bro like you're putting out so much content you're helping people and you might feel like that now on the other hand what if that same day i didn't hit the gym what if that same day i didn't learn do i have the same amount of admiration for myself and i have to you know you know what i mean so it's like i can get admiration from you but then there's this other part of admiration from myself too and i think those are also things that you can definitely everything has a solution so i don't want any of this that comes off like i know some people in the comments are like college you have like low energy man you're sad like we're here for you guys i'm not sad i don't have long energy i'm just like being reflective and there's always a solution for example i can probably just go hard in the morning and have morning time to learn and to train really hard and then the rest of the day i can focus on producing content and then evening i can like actually reflect that's very very possible it comes down to being effective and having good time management right and it might be easy for me to look into your life and be like boom that's the answer but when you look at your own life it's a little bit harder to you know like it's weird it's like harder to balance certain things out so so yeah those were a few of the things that were on my mind and um i'm just going through the text thread that we had right and pretty much ultimately like i started having a conversation with a bunch of people at that time on instagram and we were going really deep into it but ultimately i just came to that balance is not gonna go away but in order to feed your own thing i call it like take the devil out for a walk so take your alter ego out for a walk every single day because i think of people like dwayne johnson the rock i think of people like joe rogan how are these people they're animals right but then at the same time they're very calm and loving to people and caring and mild tempered and they don't have these random they don't get frustrated and have these random things happen right it made me realize you need to have good outlets to let that devil out for a walk if you don't it's going to come out in other weird ways it's going to come out on your own people on your own team members but maybe in the mornings for me what it means is having disciplined time to work out to learn to maybe even get on these podcast style of videos and share because i get a lot of insight from you guys as well and that can be like my growing time and then after that it's like sharing you know the things that um yeah just sharing the things that i've picked up on so maybe for you what does that mean maybe for you it means you know what what are you feeling like do you feel like you're giving yourself enough time or are you always just giving other people time and doing things for other people if you are not then maybe you need to have just a very strict disciplined thing in the morning where that's your time and it's untouchable no communication no contact just you focused on you doing your thing for maybe three four five hours for me sometimes it also means waking up as early as four a.m if i have to because if it's important to me i'll i'll do it and if four to seven or four to eight they're like four hours where i can just go hard and like learn and reflect and you know lift and do kickboxing or whatever it is i think i will be so freaking happy with myself like that gives me admiration from me because i'm learning and training sharpening my sword right and then the rest of the day i can help other people sharpen theirs and that would be just clean balance ajit says bro whenever i get demotivated i watch your videos and this will help me to boosting my development hell yeah i thought it says if you smell what the rock is cooking damn we got deep on this one boys and girls there's a lot but bradley knox says interestingly i give myself way too much time trying to become a very well skilled developer to the point that i don't spend time with my children enough but i'm on a time limit and my burn rate is high so there's that few faces i'm quite the opposite i can hit the gym every single day but bringing myself to code that's the hard thing that's what i'm saying it's whatever mode you're in right like i will tell you that i was going hard at the gym last year so hard i was training six to eight hours a day in the morning i would have a power lifting session so i'm doing my deadlifts my squats my overhead presses and i was getting heavy on them for my body weight um i got so i would do that then in the afternoon i would go and run and i would do a lot of cardio i would do kickboxing and then at night time then i would go at seven or eight pm drive one and a half hour just one way to a jiu jitsu gym it was eddie bravo's jiu jitsu gym i think planet ten planet tenth planet right ten planet jiu jitsu i would go there and i would train and i'm learning all this like crazy [ __ ] like the the the leg locks and all this you know they're more focused actually on leg locks and even like guillotine or some of the other stuff which is super cool and it's really practical so i'm like learning that and i love their nogi like that's so much i hate wearing the freaking ghee and you know putting that on i just love like the nogi so i would train uh jiu jitsu for one or two hours and i was effectively training for a total of seven to eight hours a day and i was enjoying it then i would come back and all i would do is watch jiu jitsu on my tv till i just crashed and knocked out right and then woke up the next day and then i would just repeat rinse and repeat rinse and repeat so really good at mastering something and then just immersing and doing it and just going all out hot really bad at like like a little of this today a little of this look that balance it just something i have to keep working on sueta says let's see mac talk if someone wants to go for web development in future what tech would you recommend to learn apart from react i mean you will need to know a few things so i'd recommend learning firebase so you can actually host your app and have a database i would recommend learning node node.js i would recommend learning about apis i would recommend learning about microservices whether you learn it through firebase or aws elijah fuller says dividing attention for me is really hard as well okay i ayush says you are like an elder brother to me and i truly wish to have a meet up with you as soon as this pandemic ends and it would be an honor guys i gotta run i really appreciate you i don't know how did you guys like this i want to do more stuff like this it's it just really speaks to me like what we kind of talked about today and how we just got in depth just about life i really really enjoyed it like personally and i feel like if we can have conversations like these i think a lot of the solution is just sometimes having conversations like these as well because it just opens your mind to so many different possibilities and ways of looking at life so yeah freaky this was like really really great and i would love to do more of these if you guys are down priyanji says do it quasi i'll be there awesome bro thank you was really good thank you for the knowledge awesome bro nice to see you if you not feel better you can contact me always ready to help a dharva man i'm telling you guys like i am i'm not like um and i i really appreciate that by the way so thank you for that that actually does mean a lot but i just want to be clear like i'm not sad or in a depressed state like if i was i would let you guys know like i'm actually i used to be very embarrassed of that oh i can't tell people but i would let you know like last year in august i was kind of depressed and i was just freaking sad but right now i'm not like that at all i'm actually even right now in a really good headspace but i'm just in quiet reflective mode so my energy will be very different than my regular youtube videos right and so there's going to be a difference like my regular youtube videos i'm like yo what is up guys how's it going this is qazi atharva how are you doing today bro really really nice to see you priyanshu man beautiful this is epic it's a it's a switch i can turn it on turn it off it's not a fake part of me but it's just it's it's a part of me if i need to be lit and have epic energy i can turn it on if i don't i just need to chill i can turn it off and turning it off allows me to go deeper into my thought because when i'm in the other mode i'm all like i'm just kind of good at speaking getting to what you're saying fast it's kind of like my garyvee mode but this is like where i can actually consume this is where i'm like i empty out what i know like i empty out the water bottle and i'm i'm ready to listen i'm ready to learn says cause you love when you share your true self with us you sound emotional today we need more videos like this this is the energy let's go the extroverted programmer yeah 800k
