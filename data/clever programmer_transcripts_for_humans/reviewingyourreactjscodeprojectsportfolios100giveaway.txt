22:08 - i'm just going to pull up the
22:10 - submitted projects right now so i'm just
22:13 - going through them right so
22:14 - let's go ahead and wow guys check this
22:17 - out like we have a ton of submissions
22:21 - from you guys like this is just a few of
22:24 - the submissions that we have right now
22:25 - and you can see like it is
22:27 - full of everything that we have got
22:29 - right here so let's go ahead and check
22:31 - out the first one so
22:33 - here we have a to-do app so i'm going to
22:35 - go ahead and open this up
22:36 - let's go ahead and give this a review so
22:38 - this is a to-do app so here you go hello
22:40 - you are cool thank you very much we have
22:42 - full quad functionality apparently
22:44 - so let's go ahead and say this is a test
22:47 - update to do nice so it's actually
22:50 - working this is full quad functionality
22:52 - what i mean by crud is i can add a
22:53 - message so here i'm adding a
22:56 - to-do so adding it to do and i click oh
22:59 - okay like adding a to-do
23:03 - okay so guys did you see that you have
23:05 - to be careful with that honestly like
23:07 - when you
23:07 - have a form you have to make sure you
23:09 - call e dot prevent default to make sure
23:12 - that doesn't actually
23:13 - um that doesn't actually become the case
23:17 - so you don't actually want
23:18 - to have it so that bear with me one
23:21 - second guys
23:22 - you don't want to have it so that you
23:24 - accidentally
23:25 - um refresh your page because notice when
23:27 - i hit enter when i hit the enter key
23:29 - guys look what happens
23:31 - ah see we don't like that refreshing we
23:33 - don't like that refreshing
23:34 - also guys we like if you do build an app
23:37 - and you put this on your portfolio
23:38 - guys make sure that you style it okay
23:40 - like this is
23:41 - very like bare minimal basics and the
23:44 - problem with this kind of app is look if
23:46 - i go ahead and resize it
23:47 - i'm gonna start breaking things and now
23:49 - you have to be very careful here guys
23:51 - because this is the functionality is
23:54 - great
23:54 - so honestly keep up with the
23:56 - functionality um and let's go ahead and
23:58 - see who built this one so we have
24:00 - um abhishek dandriol so this is an
24:02 - amazing app bro but honestly make sure
24:04 - that you style it
24:06 - and make sure that you actually go ahead
24:08 - and add look even here we have i
24:09 - am a model so guys hey we don't want
24:12 - this we want a nice user experience but
24:14 - what's cool
24:15 - is that it's all persistent so i'm
24:16 - assuming this is on firebase
24:18 - so amazing stuff well done for doing
24:20 - that
24:21 - that's really really nice let's go ahead
24:23 - and move over to the next one
24:25 - uh let's go ahead and check out another
24:27 - one so we've here we've got
24:29 - name pro name proofer so let's go ahead
24:32 - and check this one
24:33 - so i'm just going to pull up the tables
24:35 - again
24:36 - so here we go we have a name proofer so
24:39 - an open source i can't see what it says
24:41 - an open source
24:42 - username availability checker nice so
24:44 - check out screenshot okay
24:46 - that's pretty cool so i'm assuming
24:47 - they're going to check all of these out
24:49 - and then we can go ahead and see that so
24:50 - let's go ahead and open this one up
24:53 - let's see let's see what this is about
24:55 - so while that's loading
24:57 - where can i submit my project for review
24:59 - click the link in the description bro
25:01 - and you can then submit your project and
25:04 - so there's a link in the description you
25:06 - can submit and you'll be brought to
25:08 - this page and you'll be able to submit
25:11 - your project
25:12 - over here so please go ahead and do that
25:14 - if you do want to be
25:15 - considered for winning this 100 prize so
25:18 - back to the project let's go here and
25:21 - now we can see that let's enter a
25:22 - username so let's say
25:24 - let's do demand so the man one two three
25:27 - and let's go ahead and check whoa
25:30 - check that out guys so it actually
25:32 - lights up and let's go ahead and do my
25:34 - username so this is my instagram right
25:36 - let's go and see what happens
25:37 - so if i do this check okay nice
25:41 - so they found like i think this means
25:43 - that they're going to be so signs are
25:44 - available silvers are taken greens are
25:46 - invalid but if i was to do this
25:48 - and check nice okay so i'm not sure the
25:51 - instagrams
25:51 - one's working okay apparently there was
25:53 - someone with that username nice
25:55 - so if i go ahead and do this right so i
25:58 - think
25:58 - no way somebody can't have that
26:01 - okay i mean maybe it's checking for a
26:04 - contains
26:04 - maybe it's checking here for that but
26:06 - the point is that's a really cool app
26:08 - guys that's really really nice so
26:10 - let's go ahead and check this out so we
26:11 - have dweep pancho so
26:13 - let's go ahead and dive into his code so
26:16 - i'm just going to go ahead
26:17 - and have a little check and firstly
26:18 - before i do that actually i just want to
26:20 - see
26:21 - if if we have a responsive site right
26:23 - now so let's go ahead and minimize this
26:26 - okay so you see here guys here what i
26:29 - would recommend is whenever you run into
26:30 - this problem
26:31 - make sure you guys make use of something
26:33 - called flexbox okay so
26:35 - in this case you see whenever you want
26:36 - to resize this stuff
26:38 - you want to be using something called
26:40 - flexbox and flexbox is going to allow
26:43 - you
26:43 - to have a responsive design so let's go
26:46 - ahead and check
26:47 - out that project what we talked about
26:49 - earlier which was uh this was
26:53 - blah blah blah i think i don't know if
26:54 - we have it open anymore um
26:57 - okay so it's not here but you see like
26:59 - whenever when i
27:00 - resize this one the app the website
27:03 - isn't gonna break right you see
27:04 - everything sort of starts to the images
27:06 - is shrinking correctly and everything
27:08 - works as it should flexbox is going to
27:10 - help you achieve that level
27:11 - of styling so back to uh the code for
27:14 - this project
27:16 - let's go ahead and have a look what he
27:17 - what did he use so we have app.js
27:20 - so let's go ahead and see here we have
27:22 - react so here we've got some you
27:24 - some hooks being used that's really
27:26 - really nice and we have a bunch of hooks
27:28 - being used this is awesome he uses some
27:30 - regex
27:31 - which is nice we have so this is some
27:33 - clean code right here
27:35 - so like here we have like some so a
27:36 - bunch of different promises this is a
27:38 - very
27:38 - nice way of handling this um
27:42 - okay this is really cool i think what
27:43 - you could do in this case is if you've
27:45 - got you see here
27:46 - guys we have a bunch of like repeated
27:48 - what seems to look like
27:50 - oh okay no it's not it's because we have
27:51 - different different um hooks being used
27:53 - but this is awesome this is really
27:55 - really nice
27:55 - i would recommend when your code starts
27:57 - to get past you see like
27:59 - here it's getting past the hundred
28:01 - hundred sort of
28:02 - uh 100 mark in terms of how many lines
28:05 - of code
28:06 - at this point guys i would really
28:07 - recommend that you go ahead and start
28:10 - refactoring
28:11 - so use like 100 as your sort of cut off
28:13 - you can actually start probably most
28:15 - likely refactoring most of this into
28:17 - separate components
28:18 - and you should be able to actually get
28:19 - ahead and make this code much more
28:21 - readable and maintainable
28:23 - but let's see how he's done his styling
28:24 - so guys i'm not a huge fan
28:27 - when it comes to doing inline styles
28:29 - right so i noticed here he's got class
28:31 - names of color descending
28:33 - but you see right here we have a mixture
28:36 - of css styling so this is going to be
28:38 - styled in a css file
28:40 - but then this is called an inline style
28:43 - right so inline
28:45 - oops inline style and the problem with
28:48 - this guys is that you have a mix and not
28:50 - only do you have a mix
28:52 - inline styles take precedence so these
28:55 - ones
28:56 - take so if let's say i have the same
28:58 - rule and then the css file
28:59 - and in the inline style the inline style
29:02 - wins
29:03 - okay the inline style is the one that
29:05 - takes precedence now when you
29:07 - when that you start to do that kind of
29:09 - stuff you're going to run into issues
29:10 - because you're gonna start having
29:12 - rules in your css file that aren't gonna
29:14 - be
29:15 - you think that they're not gonna be
29:16 - listened to when in reality you're just
29:17 - overwriting it with
29:19 - with this so this will actually go ahead
29:21 - and overwrite
29:22 - any css rules apologize for my
29:24 - handwriting guys
29:26 - i'm a coder i'm not the best drawer so
29:28 - there we go so here you can see like
29:30 - you're gonna have problems with that so
29:32 - just a little tip
29:33 - right there but in all honesty this is
29:36 - pretty cool this is actually a pretty
29:37 - nice project
29:38 - um we're going to just we're not going
29:40 - to dive too far deep into some of these
29:42 - but i like how he separated things out
29:44 - here we have a backend.js file which is
29:46 - nice so he has
29:47 - he's using process.n to keep his
29:50 - credentials very
29:51 - safe and secure which is really nice um
29:54 - so that's awesome
29:55 - so let's go ahead and jump out of this
29:57 - one so that's really nice and guys
29:58 - what do you guys think of this project
30:00 - so let me know in the comments now
30:01 - let me know in the comment section by
30:05 - dropping a number between 0 and 10 10
30:08 - being
30:08 - amazing project like this thing it blew
30:11 - my mind
30:12 - and a zero being yeah you know we could
30:14 - do better but in this in this case i'll
30:16 - give this a solid sort of
30:18 - around the 7 mark because that's a
30:19 - pretty cool that's a pretty cool app
30:20 - right that's a pretty cool app
30:22 - so let me know in the comments what you
30:23 - guys think and if you're enjoying that
30:25 - smash the thumbs up button
30:26 - so let's go ahead and i'll keep an eye
30:28 - on the comment section as we go ahead
30:30 - and and we've got a nice little comment
30:31 - here saying hey sonny this is awesome
30:33 - thanks for doing reviews you are welcome
30:36 - dude and we will be happy to do this
30:37 - more often if you guys find it useful
30:39 - okay so let's go ahead and see so we've
30:41 - got eight
30:42 - five six okay so somebody gave it eight
30:45 - okay nice
30:46 - so somebody said hey it's honey big bro
30:48 - you are amazing
30:49 - we have a few numbers here we have a mix
30:51 - we have availa storm gave it an
30:52 - eight that's interesting nice so a lot
30:54 - of these i can see coming in at seven
30:56 - seven okay so nice seven six so let's
30:59 - give it let's give that one i would say
31:01 - a solid let's give it a six i think a
31:03 - six purely the reason why i'm gonna give
31:04 - this one a six
31:05 - is because the use case was amazing guys
31:08 - but the responsive design
31:09 - just didn't get me here right it just
31:11 - didn't didn't get me here and
31:13 - in terms of what we could have done is
31:14 - such a nice app
31:16 - guys it's a really really nice app but
31:18 - the responsiveness of the website
31:19 - let me down a little bit in terms of if
31:22 - i go ahead and change this to a mobile
31:23 - phone
31:24 - then again it does work pretty decent on
31:26 - a mobile phone let's go ahead and check
31:27 - an iphone
31:28 - okay but you see it starts to crop off
31:30 - and it could look amazing if we just use
31:32 - flexbox guys
31:33 - it could look so so nice and it could be
31:35 - really really good if we just used a bit
31:36 - of flexbox here
31:37 - um so let's go ahead and uh let me
31:41 - actually see if i could do something
31:43 - right now for you guys okay so we're not
31:44 - going to do that but
31:46 - oh here's using flexbox but i think the
31:48 - problem here guys is you should put all
31:50 - of these inside of one flexbox container
31:52 - so whenever you're using flexbox put all
31:54 - of these in one container
31:56 - and then apply your flex rules and then
31:57 - they would have been listed in a
31:58 - beautiful
32:00 - nice way um but yes let's give this one
32:02 - a solid
32:03 - seven let's give it a seven okay so
32:05 - moving on
32:07 - let's go ahead and check out some more
32:09 - of your guys projects

34:35 - react
34:35 - i love that guys if you're enjoying it
34:37 - and if anyone else has been inspired by
34:39 - this
34:39 - smash the thumbs up button and let me
34:41 - know if you're psyched to carry one with
34:43 - these live streams and let's carry on
34:44 - going
34:46 - um so somebody says are you from england
34:48 - yes yes i am from england
34:49 - great question right so carrying on with
34:51 - the the the review so let's go ahead and
34:53 - dive into the code for this right
34:55 - so here we have g and this was by jean
34:59 - daniel d saw amazing work right here by
35:02 - gene
35:02 - daniel deities and let's go ahead and
35:04 - see so this was built with create react
35:06 - app so awesome stuff
35:08 - really nice to see that and you've used
35:10 - yarn i see so nice okay
35:12 - uh and let's go ahead and check the
35:13 - source
35:15 - okay firstly guys i really like how she
35:17 - split things up we've got
35:18 - an api inside of one photo we've got
35:20 - components containers
35:23 - really clean that's a good that's a good
35:24 - little pattern right here we've got
35:25 - images styles views
35:26 - and so forth let's go ahead and check
35:28 - the uh components this is what i like to
35:30 - see
35:30 - i like to see things when they're very
35:32 - like neatly organized we have movie
35:34 - details search components let's go ahead
35:35 - and check the card component this is
35:37 - what i'm talking about guys
35:39 - this is what you want you want isolated
35:41 - components you want small isolated
35:43 - components
35:44 - that you can upgrade and get things and
35:46 - you can build and add on top of right
35:48 - so we have a la quinley sorry if i
35:51 - pronounce that wrong
35:52 - thank you so much brother for the love
35:54 - and i really appreciate you being here
35:56 - right now and checking this out
35:58 - um okay so let's carry on with the
36:01 - review
36:01 - so let's go ahead and check out one of
36:03 - the components so here we have
36:06 - an example of the component so firstly
36:08 - very nice
36:09 - to see that they are using they are
36:11 - actually using a bunch of hooks so here
36:13 - we have a hook
36:14 - here we have prop types which is really
36:16 - nice so the prop types if you guys don't
36:18 - know
36:19 - enforce uh what a prop should be so
36:21 - imagine you had a bunch of props coming
36:23 - into your app so
36:24 - props props props here you would say
36:27 - basically like
36:28 - uh what the type of the prop was whether
36:30 - it was a number or whether
36:32 - it was a string so prop types is pretty
36:35 - much going to basically allow you
36:37 - to go ahead so let me go ahead and cut
36:39 - that oops let's go ahead and get that so
36:40 - prop
36:41 - types is going to allow you to enforce
36:44 - what type your prop should be so if it
36:46 - should be a string if it should be a
36:47 - number if it should be an object
36:49 - etc uh really really nice
36:52 - comments here by the way guys inspired
36:54 - you by your live streams awesome work
36:56 - thank you very much man
36:58 - um okay so let's go ahead and carry on
37:01 - so we've got
37:01 - a really nice this is called a
37:03 - destructuring so really nice to see some
37:05 - es6 functions right here
37:07 - uh and nice look at this guys he's even
37:09 - got this is some really really cool
37:11 - um this guy has been developing for a
37:14 - bit i can tell because he's got some
37:15 - very very
37:16 - nicely laid out code and he's using a a
37:20 - a library that concatenates classes
37:22 - called class names i've used class names
37:24 - before guys
37:25 - so this is actually a really really
37:27 - solid project so far
37:28 - so let's go ahead and check out movie
37:31 - details and let's go ahead and see this
37:33 - so here we have some more stuff
37:34 - there's some more styles right here
37:37 - we've got a so he's getting it from tmdb
37:39 - so awesome stuff
37:40 - tmdb is how we actually built the
37:43 - netflix clone so this phone that you see
37:45 - right here
37:45 - is pulling from the tmdb api so that's
37:48 - really really cool to see that
37:50 - um awesome so here we have axios axios
37:52 - is being used
37:53 - to make our requests to the api
37:57 - and that's awesome to see guys so he
37:58 - actually has props and he does console
38:00 - logs
38:01 - make sure you do clean up your console
38:02 - logs guys so when you do want to sort of
38:04 - submit your code
38:05 - make sure you don't leave any sort of
38:07 - over overhanging
38:08 - uh console logs in your project also i
38:11 - would recommend using prettier so you
38:13 - see here we have this white space
38:14 - very small issue but priya will help you
38:16 - get rid of that now here guys i
38:18 - recommend
38:19 - you see like we've got all of these sort
38:20 - of names right you've got class name
38:22 - you've got this class name
38:23 - you've got other class names something i
38:25 - really recommend that everyone goes and
38:26 - learns
38:27 - for all of to handle all of your class
38:29 - naming issues is something called
38:31 - bem right so i'm going to go ahead and
38:34 - uh let me just draw on the screen right
38:35 - now let's go ahead and draw this
38:37 - so guys if you want to get this nailed
38:39 - down and you want this to look clean as
38:41 - hell
38:41 - then i would recommend everybody goes
38:43 - and learns them
38:44 - class name convention so it's a
38:46 - convention um and that you got
38:48 - i recommend all of you guys go and learn
38:50 - and basically what it is is bem
38:52 - css so let's go ahead and check out bem
38:55 - it stands for block element modifier
38:57 - right now i know a lot of you guys
38:59 - thinking oh i have no idea what that
39:00 - means
39:01 - but i recommend that everyone goes ahead
39:03 - and checks out this website so it's
39:05 - pretty much
39:06 - bam so go ahead over to getbem.com
39:10 - and this will teach you how to name your
39:13 - classes
39:14 - right and it's very very good especially
39:17 - when you're doing
39:18 - uh react development okay so it's really
39:20 - really good when you do a reactive
39:22 - development
39:22 - so make sure that you guys go ahead and
39:24 - check that out
39:26 - okay um let's go ahead and see if the
39:28 - stream is good okay so everything seems
39:30 - to be okay
39:31 - right now everyone's saying the stream
39:33 - is lagging i apologize if the stream is
39:35 - lagging guys
39:36 - hopefully it clears up soon um but let's
39:39 - go ahead and back to the app so what i
39:41 - might do at this
39:42 - point is rather than going through the
39:44 - code of every single one
39:45 - let's go ahead and test the traits of
39:47 - different apps okay and then what we can
39:48 - do is the ones that make it to the sort
39:50 - of
39:50 - top tier level then ones we can actually
39:53 - go ahead and
39:55 - then ones we can go actually go ahead
39:56 - and give them a ranking from one stand
39:58 - so
39:59 - for this app guys i think this is a
40:01 - solid build i think this is a really
40:03 - nice app
40:04 - let's go ahead and give this a ranking
40:06 - between zero
40:07 - and ten guys i honestly think this is
40:10 - this is up there guys
40:11 - so let me know in the comments what you
40:12 - guys are thinking about this app
40:15 - right here guys let me know what you're
40:16 - thinking about this app because this is
40:18 - amazing and i will be dropping
40:19 - personalized video feedback
40:21 - for this exact app because this is a
40:23 - really really cool project here
40:25 - um which i actually i really like the
40:27 - front end i like how he's done it's got
40:28 - some really nice
40:29 - um styling on this page so let's go
40:32 - ahead and
40:32 - drop in the comment section below what
40:34 - we think this deserves in terms of a
40:37 - ranking
40:38 - i'm gonna give this in the meantime i'm
40:40 - gonna give this maybe an eight or a nine
40:42 - this is this is a good app right this is
40:44 - a really cool app okay
40:45 - so let's go ahead and check out some
40:47 - more projects
40:50 - so let's go see we have a bunch of
40:52 - different we have netflix clowns i'm
40:53 - going to try
40:54 - and check out the apps that we didn't
40:56 - actually build in the live streams so i
40:58 - want to go ahead and
41:00 - do something that we we haven't built in
41:01 - the live streams and hopefully guys that
41:03 - would actually help you guys
41:05 - um go ahead and get some more exposure
41:07 - to different kind of apps so all of the
41:09 - other
41:09 - apps here so you see this one so here we
41:11 - have a to-do app
41:13 - portfolio so let's go ahead and check

42:20 - scroll down oh let's go have a look
42:23 - we've got we've got a drop down right
42:25 - here
42:26 - we've got education and skills let's see
42:30 - um okay it says the stream is buffering
42:32 - so it's apologies guys if it is cutting
42:34 - out at all
42:35 - um but it should be clearing up soon
42:38 - okay
42:39 - so here you can see we've got a really
42:41 - nice portfolio actually over here
42:44 - but you see it seems to it seems to cut
42:46 - off underneath here so i mean
42:48 - okay so this is the latest but you see
42:50 - like small small things guys
42:53 - we want to make sure let me go ahead and
42:55 - check something yeah small small things
42:56 - guys we want to make sure
42:58 - that we aren't actually um that we
43:01 - aren't actually
43:02 - having design flaws like this right
43:05 - um so i see that the issue yeah so there
43:07 - is a bit of lag here guys i apologize
43:09 - for the delay
43:10 - but um hopefully guys we i'm actually
43:12 - going to go ahead and carry on with this
43:14 - video
43:14 - and what we can do is i will actually go
43:17 - ahead and review these
43:18 - myself and the stream should catch up by
43:20 - the time we go ahead and get started
43:23 - okay so let's go back and check this out
43:27 - so
43:28 - this app is pretty nice we have a very
43:30 - nice ui but
43:31 - again guys i don't like it when we can't
43:33 - scroll down like it looks beautiful it
43:35 - looks really nice
43:36 - but it's just a case of i can't like i
43:39 - have to click
43:40 - that little drop down in order to
43:41 - navigate the website and only then like
43:43 - you see there's a bunch of really cool
43:45 - apps here
43:45 - there's a music player which is really
43:47 - nice i can go ahead and click this so
43:49 - this i like
43:50 - this is really cool wow this is really
43:52 - cool now this is a really
43:54 - nice app and here you can see and let's
43:56 - go ahead and check if it's actually
43:57 - responsive
43:59 - so this is actually a very cool so you
44:02 - see right now he's got some overflow
44:03 - here which is nice but there's a little
44:04 - bit of a glitch
44:05 - here with the with the sort of um let's
44:08 - go ahead and click play oh nice so it
44:10 - actually goes ahead someplace
44:13 - nice that's pretty cool nice to see that
44:15 - okay so i can actually see a lot of
44:17 - people's coming in
44:18 - uh comments finally coming in about the
44:20 - movie app i can see
44:21 - nines and tens okay that is really cool
44:24 - to see guys so that movie app that we
44:26 - just demoed this one over here
44:28 - i believe everyone has given this a nine
44:30 - or a ten so that's actually that's
44:31 - pretty cool guys and that's really up
44:33 - there
44:34 - um this app right here is pretty cool as
44:36 - well but i don't i'm not a big fan of
44:38 - the
44:38 - user experience on this page it looks
44:41 - really nice but i have to click this
44:43 - top left awkward link to be able to get
44:46 - here so it's
44:46 - not a biggest fan of that guys not the
44:48 - biggest fan of that it should be very
44:50 - simple and i should just be able to
44:52 - scroll on my mouse
44:53 - um but i can't seem to get anywhere with
44:55 - it so you want to be careful of things
44:57 - like that when it comes to designing
44:59 - your apps
45:00 - um so having another look through this
45:02 - let's go ahead and jump into the gear
45:04 - no this is what i meant guys here we
45:06 - have an amazing github search app with
45:08 - some amazing functionality
45:09 - so this is the one i demoed earlier so
45:11 - sunny sanger we go ahead and click
45:13 - search
45:14 - this app's really nice like it's really
45:16 - really cool i would have loved to have
45:18 - seen the code for this i really really
45:20 - wouldn't love so let's go ahead and view
45:21 - his repositories
45:22 - and let's go ahead and see if we can
45:25 - actually get
45:26 - um some ah damn it so ahmed but lady if
45:29 - you are here
45:30 - then be sure to actually please please
45:33 - please maybe re-upload
45:35 - with the code base because i would love
45:36 - to go and check your code and see how
45:38 - you did that
45:39 - right that would be an awesome thing to
45:42 - see and it'll be really really nice to
45:43 - see um
45:44 - how that goes um so
45:47 - moving on let's have a look at here we
45:50 - have snap it what is that so let's go
45:52 - ahead and check a screenshot
45:54 - validate email so let's go ahead and
45:56 - check this link out
45:58 - snap it so we here we have okay
46:00 - interesting oh
46:01 - nice okay look at this we actually have
46:05 - a little code terminal guys
46:07 - this is pretty cool this is pretty nice
46:09 - so look at this we have
46:10 - different coding languages here so let's
46:12 - go ahead and do javascript
46:14 - and let's go ahead and write some
46:16 - javascript in here so if i was to do
46:17 - like
46:18 - const name equals sunny
46:23 - that's pretty cool that's pretty cool
46:25 - and look at that if i was to go ahead
46:26 - and choose a completely different
46:27 - language
46:28 - like my sequel okay so it actually does
46:31 - okay i think
46:32 - what would make this app even better is
46:33 - if we had some some code which was
46:35 - actually
46:36 - rendered every time so you but you see
46:38 - it's got syntax highlight which is
46:40 - pretty cool but
46:40 - different code examples would be really
46:42 - nice for this but i can see the use case
46:44 - for this guys so let's go ahead and do
46:46 - css
46:47 - and if i was to get rid of this and do
46:48 - something like this now let's just say
46:49 - like
46:50 - let's just call it like um button
46:53 - class and you can see like let's go
46:55 - ahead and do something like display oh
46:57 - let's do background
46:59 - color white right well i think you just
47:02 - do it like this yeah background color
47:04 - white
47:04 - and you could do like font size equals
47:07 - like 20 pixels
47:08 - so this is awesome guys so like imagine
47:10 - you had this
47:11 - and then you had something like the
47:12 - button delete variant and let's say you
47:14 - had the button
47:16 - this is bem styles uh convention by the
47:18 - way what i'm doing here
47:20 - so you have the delete button and then
47:21 - we could also do something like the add
47:23 - button or something like
47:24 - that and then this one could have 22 3
47:26 - pixels we've got 26 pixels and for
47:28 - example
47:28 - what you could then go ahead and do is
47:30 - just snap that so you can go ahead and
47:32 - screenshot that and you have a nice
47:33 - little thing
47:34 - so if i click snap it i wonder what that
47:36 - does does that actually post something
47:37 - into my
47:39 - okay i wonder what that snap does that
47:41 - would be nice if you actually sort of
47:42 - just like
47:43 - took a picture and maybe saved it as a
47:45 - download that would be kind of cool
47:47 - but that's really cool to see guys i
47:48 - like to see different use cases for that
47:50 - let's go ahead and check the code for
47:52 - that one let's go ahead and check the
47:54 - code for that one
47:55 - so amerban hello how's it going so that
47:58 - is my beautiful girlfriend i have not
48:00 - forgotten about you
48:01 - and thank you for always supporting me
48:02 - on these live calls love you to pieces
48:04 - and
48:05 - yeah there you go thank you ma i'm not
48:07 - for shouting that one out
48:09 - nice um
48:12 - i'm a knob says he's now in love with
48:14 - react
48:15 - i've always been in love with reactor
48:17 - i'm not it's always it's just one of
48:18 - those things all right
48:20 - so carrying on let's have a look at that
48:22 - code base we have source
48:24 - let's go ahead and look at this so
48:28 - here we have oh nice so here we actually
48:31 - have a context api
48:33 - so we have some a reducer here so we've
48:35 - actually got a date adobe
48:36 - and he's using typescript oh my god guys
48:39 - he's using typescript this is amazing
48:42 - i love to see projects that are using
48:43 - typescript and he's got a full-on
48:45 - reducer this is really nice and guys for
48:48 - a simple project because in for
48:50 - something which looks fairly simple
48:51 - he's actually built this out really nice
48:53 - he's got components
48:55 - with a folder structure here which makes
48:57 - a lot of sense we have a header here
48:59 - and you can see he's got a title and
49:01 - he's passing in oh my god and he's even
49:03 - using memo from react
49:05 - wow okay this is really really cool to
49:07 - see guys so if many of you guys
49:10 - who don't know about typescript
49:11 - typescript is basically what we call a
49:14 - superset
49:14 - so it sits on top of javascript and it
49:17 - allows you
49:18 - to have something called strongly typed
49:21 - like
49:21 - basically that type definition so it
49:23 - allows you to say if a variable
49:25 - is a string or if a variable is a number
49:28 - or if a variable is an object or array
49:30 - etcetera and it really will enforce that
49:32 - so it will prevent it from actually
49:34 - becoming a case where
49:36 - we have issues um where for example
49:38 - you're expecting a string and you get a
49:40 - number or you're expecting an object and
49:41 - you get an array
49:42 - typescript is going to allow you and
49:44 - force you to essentially
49:46 - have the correct data types it also
49:49 - gives you really good auto completion so
49:51 - the fact is that we saw that in here is
49:53 - really really nice to see
49:55 - um so let's go ahead and look through
49:57 - his code some more
49:59 - we have reducers tailwind okay really
50:01 - nice to see that app.tsx i love seeing
50:04 - app.tsx guys
50:06 - um because i know it's then in a
50:08 - typescript
50:09 - layout so i haven't got any fancy
50:10 - typescript stuff over here
50:12 - um let's go ahead and check out pages
50:15 - snap it dot tsx so
50:18 - quick mention guys i love it when i say
50:20 - oh my god he's even using used callback
50:23 - this is so cool and he's got the right
50:25 - type definitions for a select element
50:27 - okay this
50:28 - is very very powerful guys so for those
50:31 - of you who are new to typescript this
50:32 - may not make a lot of sense
50:34 - but what he's doing is he's using the
50:37 - the latest sort of
50:38 - react hook so he's got use state use
50:39 - callback use fetch context that's a new
50:42 - one
50:42 - interesting i haven't seen that one
50:43 - before but basically guys this and even
50:46 - use memo
50:46 - wow use memo guys is basically whenever
50:49 - we have an expensive sort of calculation
50:51 - in our code so for example if we have to
50:53 - map out a massive
50:55 - list of things then use memo essentially
50:58 - kind of
50:58 - kind of like it's like a cache which
51:00 - means that like if it loads it once
51:02 - and it takes ages to load it right it's
51:05 - going to just
51:05 - cache it and it's going to basically
51:08 - it's going to cache it and then it's
51:09 - going to essentially
51:11 - see um so let's go ahead it's going to
51:13 - catch it yeah and it's going to cache it
51:14 - and it's basically going to have it so
51:15 - that
51:16 - the next time it needs that element it
51:17 - doesn't need to re-render
51:19 - right it doesn't need to re-render it
51:20 - doesn't need to do all of those things
51:21 - it's actually just going to basically
51:23 - use whatever it just previously rendered
51:25 - unless the dependencies inside of this
51:27 - little square brackets
51:28 - change you'll notice this pattern um
51:30 - quite a lot in react and you'll see this
51:32 - more and more often
51:33 - where you have oops where you have
51:37 - uh you'll see this pattern more often
51:38 - wherever you where you need like a
51:40 - dependency to put inside of a hook
51:43 - for example we see that a lot in the use
51:44 - effect hook okay
51:46 - so yo sunny i can see you so
51:49 - we've actually got the clever programmer
51:50 - team shouting onto the page right now
51:53 - um awesome
51:56 - all right guys bear in mind yo is that
51:59 - code
51:59 - yeah i know right so here like we've got
52:02 - the team
52:03 - shouting out that the code terminal snap
52:04 - is lit and it is guys it is crazy
52:07 - and also guys if your comments are being
52:10 - delayed it is most likely because of the
52:11 - live stream so i can see a bunch of
52:13 - comments coming through
52:14 - but it seems like everybody thinks i'm
52:16 - not responding in time there is a little
52:18 - delay here guys
52:19 - so just be aware of that but yeah moving
52:22 - over to the snap it terminal this thing
52:24 - is crazy i think this is such a cool
52:27 - thing to see guys and it's actually such
52:29 - a clever use case
52:30 - i think we might we might actually use
52:32 - this like i find this a really really
52:34 - useful
52:35 - awkward moment when kazi is watching
52:38 - your live stream
52:39 - kazi what's up dude if everyone wants to
52:41 - give kazzy a shout out go ahead and drop
52:43 - him some love in the comment section
52:44 - yo where am i i'm not in the live stream
52:48 - awesome to see that oh man let's go
52:50 - ahead um
52:52 - how do i i think i've double it oh there
52:53 - we go nice
52:55 - so guys yeah i think this is actually a
52:56 - really cool one so let's go ahead and
52:58 - drop some
52:59 - fire for this uh project right here and
53:01 - if you guys want to drop a ranking
53:03 - from 0 to 10 where 10 is like holy crap
53:07 - i need this app in my life and where
53:09 - zero is like
53:10 - man we could do better than this i
53:12 - personally am going to give this this
53:14 - is hand in hand next to that movie app
53:15 - that we saw earlier so right now we have
53:17 - a pretty close battle here
53:19 - with the movie app and the snap it app
53:22 - i'm really liking bowfish but
53:24 - this one guys is using typescript so
53:26 - this one i love it for one main reason
53:28 - and that is we have typescript so
53:32 - not only is the use case really really
53:34 - cool but we have
53:35 - typescript which is an amazing superset
53:38 - of javascript and it basically just
53:40 - supercharges our code base so i'd
53:42 - recommend everyone goes ahead and checks
53:44 - that out okay so moving over to the next
53:48 - project um i thought so
53:51 - we have amino is a freaking legend
53:54 - shout out to my beautiful girlfriend
53:57 - lovely
53:58 - uh so let's go ahead and carry on so we
54:00 - have the
54:01 - oh wow dude we have a face detection app
54:05 - let's go let's check this one out let's
54:08 - go and see if this works
54:09 - okay so we have an image url so let me
54:11 - go ahead and pick an image
54:14 - um over here so let me go ahead and pick
54:16 - an image right here
54:17 - give me one second guys if i go detect
54:20 - enter image url so i need an image url
54:22 - so let's go ahead and drop it in here so
54:28 - so let's go ahead and boom oops there we
54:31 - go
54:32 - image url is going to be let's go ahead
54:35 - and grab an image of google's let's just
54:37 - go and say it ahead and say
54:39 - let's say steve jobs let's go get a
54:41 - picture of stevie let's see if
54:42 - it does face detection on steve jobs so
54:45 - let's go and grab
54:46 - a picture of steve and let's go again
54:48 - get this one
54:49 - copy image address and let's go back to
54:51 - oh my god i have so many tabs
54:53 - face detection and let's enter the image
54:55 - url boom detect
54:57 - what the hell that is cool guys
55:01 - if you guys like that app then drop some
55:03 - fire like that's pretty cool let's go
55:05 - ahead and do another one
55:07 - damn that's that's really nice guys i
55:09 - love seeing this
55:10 - i love seeing this i'm really just ah
55:13 - like i said guys
55:14 - i would love to see the github repo url
55:17 - for this
55:17 - because unfortunately i just i mean it's
55:19 - such a good use case but
55:21 - i need to see the code for that if i
55:22 - want to pick a winner for this
55:24 - but um amazing amazing let's go ahead
55:26 - and do another let's do
55:28 - mark zuckerberg and let's do
55:31 - let's make a harder one so this one he's
55:33 - standing a bit further back
55:34 - so let's go ahead and do copy image
55:36 - address and let's go ahead and
55:38 - not this one not this one not this let's
55:40 - do this one so detect
55:42 - okay oh wow that's insane yo that that's
55:45 - pretty cool
55:46 - that is that is pretty cool to see stuff
55:48 - like that i mean like
55:50 - damn it damn it i love seeing stuff like
55:54 - oh man
55:54 - that's a pretty cool app okay so guys
55:57 - let me know
55:58 - zero to ten on this app like oh i love
56:00 - it and look at the background guys i
56:02 - love seeing this like this little cool
56:03 - techie background i've seen this before
56:04 - as well
56:05 - if we change the width of this i wonder
56:06 - if that will actually make a difference
56:08 - okay awesome that's actually pretty cool
56:10 - okay so a nice nice use case there by
56:13 - md jamil kashem so really awesome stuff
56:16 - there dude
56:16 - uh we have a react lyrics app doh we
56:20 - haven't got the code
56:21 - we haven't got the github repo url so
56:23 - guys i really do want to see your code
56:25 - whenever you code this stuff so please
56:27 - please please do
56:28 - let me know so let's do a track name
56:29 - let's see what songs do i like uh
56:32 - let's go ahead and do let's do chris
56:33 - brown let's go and see chris brown
56:37 - yeah oh yeah we have some songs over
56:39 - here so let's do um
56:42 - do it okay i like this song this is
56:43 - pretty good oh nice we actually got the
56:45 - lyrics for it
56:46 - okay oh wait a minute there's some
56:47 - indian there's some punjabi oh going
56:49 - over here
56:50 - i didn't remember hearing that in the
56:51 - song um
56:53 - zach knight okay interesting so you have
56:55 - explicit no so we was actually pulling a
56:57 - bunch of sauces lyrics powdered
56:59 - powered by music match lyrics is not
57:02 - permission okay nice
57:03 - so i'm assuming this is pulling it from
57:04 - an api right here
57:06 - and actually we're actually using some
57:07 - code to do this but i can't see the code
57:09 - so unfortunately
57:10 - can't dive into that anymore so right
57:12 - now guys
57:14 - we have a nice little battle so
57:18 - so cozy we need to get sunny an internet
57:20 - connection it doesn't turn into a wooden
57:21 - potato
57:22 - yeah we do guys this needs to be fixed
57:24 - up and i will be looking into
57:25 - a connection that will get this up and
57:27 - peeked out because we had
57:28 - nearly had 700 people on this on this
57:30 - thing which is insane right
57:32 - uh okay let's go ahead and check it out
57:35 - right so
57:38 - a few more apps to look at so we have
57:40 - webdevs.com i think i saw that one it
57:42 - was a sort of
57:44 - uh directory let's go ahead covet 19
57:46 - tracker
57:47 - okay let's keep going so kovid 19
57:50 - tracker by
57:51 - my nan so my nan sha some fire right
57:54 - here guys because i'm gonna open this
57:55 - one up and i really do
57:57 - okay so we have this one this one i
57:59 - really like this is all on one page
58:01 - right so we have afghanistan let's go
58:02 - ahead and check that out
58:04 - we've got a few here so austria but guys
58:06 - this one is amazing so good work
58:09 - but uh manan sorry not sure but i saw
58:11 - something else which was just like
58:13 - an enhanced version of this by mamik das
58:16 - okay oh i wasn't sharing my screen sorry
58:18 - about that guys so the first one i
58:20 - mentioned was this one right here the
58:21 - kovid 19 tracker
58:23 - so argentina you see this like look
58:25 - dynamically updates the stats
58:28 - everything gets pushed out which is
58:29 - that's really cool right but we have
58:31 - that and then we also have this one
58:32 - which is covid info i think this is the
58:34 - one i was meant thinking about earlier
58:36 - so let's go ahead and check this one out
58:38 - it also might be slowing down because
58:39 - i've got a bunch of things opening on
58:41 - there
58:41 - but you see we have this really nice
58:43 - looking website and guys
58:44 - something i loved about this was is it
58:46 - responsive let's go ahead and check out
58:48 - is it responsive okay
58:51 - so uh let's go ahead and see so
58:54 - right let's go ahead and make this
58:56 - smaller look at that guys so firstly
58:58 - that's really nice and responsive let's
58:59 - see if we get the break point big enough
59:02 - it gets bigger it gets bigger it gets
59:03 - bigger oh snap nice
59:05 - so notice guys how if i draw around this
59:08 - so let's go ahead and
59:09 - pay attention to this section right here
59:12 - we pay attention to that section right
59:13 - here
59:14 - watch what happens when i resize so look
59:16 - at this movement
59:17 - snap nice that's amazing to see that we
59:20 - have a drop down
59:21 - instead now let's go ahead and check out
59:23 - the stats
59:24 - section and we hear we have the exact
59:26 - same sort of similar layout that we saw
59:27 - in the previous build
59:29 - um so really really nice they must be
59:30 - using the same similar library here or
59:32 - pulling this from somewhere
59:34 - but this is really nice to see so we
59:35 - have current stats and then on the
59:37 - international scale
59:38 - we have a really nice diagram which
59:40 - shows us all of the stats we have
59:42 - frequently asked questions this isn't
59:44 - this is insane this is actually a really
59:47 - cool use case for an app so i'm just
59:48 - going to go ahead and check out the code
59:50 - base for this
59:52 - so let's go ahead and check out the code
59:53 - base for this
59:56 - um let's go and see so we have source
59:59 - and here we have an api we have
60:01 - components and we have the images
60:03 - so i'm hoping that the components are
60:04 - broken up nice okay so the components
60:06 - are broken up in different photos
60:08 - we have cards.js so here we have some
60:11 - functional components which is awesome
60:12 - to see we have a react loader spinner i
60:15 - love
60:15 - uh libraries like this they're quite
60:17 - cool they allow you to have a little
60:18 - cool spinner
60:19 - when things are loading um which is dope
60:22 - um so it's carrying on and i can see
60:24 - here we're using bootstrap so nice he's
60:26 - using bootstrap
60:27 - guys i'm personally i mean like let me
60:29 - know what your thoughts are on bootstrap
60:31 - right so i'm kind of
60:32 - i'm kind of in between on it right so
60:34 - and i can see the numbers are now coming
60:36 - through for the previous project that we
60:38 - spoke about
60:39 - um so the snap it we saw some nines we
60:41 - saw some tams
60:42 - damn guys so i think it was not snap it
60:44 - we were talking about the face tracker
60:46 - so that's insane guys so i saw some tens
60:48 - come through because remember
60:49 - we are a bit delayed on the comments and
60:51 - live stream chat
60:53 - which is insane um i'm a bit i'm a bit
60:55 - like
60:56 - back and forth on bootstrap let me know
60:58 - in the comment section it's bit of a
60:59 - controversial topic some people love it
61:01 - some people hate it i'm on the fence i
61:03 - kind of wrestle with bootstrap when i
61:05 - use bootstrap i'm kind of fighting with
61:07 - it to get my rules in place instead of
61:08 - bootstrap rules
61:09 - so if you find that this is sort of like
61:11 - you find this issue too let me know in
61:13 - the comment section because i want to
61:14 - know if am i alone in this
61:16 - like do i am i the only one who fights
61:18 - with bootstrap or do you guys have that
61:20 - issue too
61:21 - if you do let me know in the comment
61:22 - section and if you guys are enjoying
61:24 - this remember
61:25 - smash the thumbs up button because it's
61:26 - always nice to get this video out to as
61:28 - many
61:29 - people as we possibly can to provide
61:32 - value to as many of you guys as we
61:34 - possibly can okay
61:35 - so let's carry on with this review so
61:37 - this is a really really cool app guys
61:39 - the kovid
61:40 - tracker here we have some very nice code
61:42 - he's used bootstrap very nicely we have
61:44 - the country selector
61:45 - so let's go ahead and check this one out
61:47 - and here you can see look here's how he
61:49 - is fetching it so he's using an async
61:50 - core and each side of the use effect and
61:53 - guys
61:54 - i don't tend to okay so this is
61:56 - something which i spot
61:57 - quite fairly a few amount of times we
62:00 - don't actually want to put
62:02 - the modifier so this set fetch countries
62:05 - inside of our dependencies you only want
62:06 - to put a raise
62:08 - like as in not array so you only want to
62:09 - put the actual variables here
62:12 - okay so you only want to put the
62:14 - variables of things here
62:15 - right because when you put this this is
62:18 - the function that we use
62:20 - to actually modify so what we're saying
62:22 - is we're saying
62:23 - fire off this code every time the
62:25 - function changes but the function isn't
62:27 - ever going to change
62:28 - it's going to be the variable so it's
62:30 - going to be fetched countries
62:32 - so in fact what we should be doing here
62:34 - is i mean
62:35 - right at this point we should actually
62:36 - be leaving this maybe blank we shouldn't
62:38 - actually be using this
62:39 - um we shouldn't actually we don't
62:41 - actually seem to have any dependencies
62:43 - here
62:43 - um that need to be in this block so i
62:46 - would actually go ahead and remove this
62:48 - because we don't actually need this okay
62:51 - uh also i just wanted to shout out some
62:53 - comments right now so i can see

66:49 - okay let's go ahead and carry on with
66:52 - the review
66:54 - so this one right here is an amazing
66:56 - project guys the kovid
66:57 - tracker so i just want to get some some
67:00 - numbers here guys so this one is a
67:01 - really clean build for me i even like
67:04 - how
67:04 - they've designed it over here like you
67:06 - see it's very nice i mean
67:07 - there was one element which i wasn't a
67:09 - fan of which was this like i'm not sure
67:11 - why we have this massive gap underneath
67:13 - here
67:14 - but i mean it's not the it's not the
67:16 - worst issue it's just the case of
67:17 - the user experience here was just
67:19 - slightly off just a tiny bit off by that
67:21 - small
67:21 - like i don't know why we have this gap
67:23 - but beyond that
67:25 - also look at this guys look news look at
67:26 - this little loader so this is
67:28 - asynchronous work at hand here
67:30 - really really nice loader here and um
67:33 - yeah so this is awesome
67:35 - so here we have some news about kovi 19
67:38 - unfortunately it's not the best news but
67:39 - the reality is
67:40 - is the code itself is great and it looks
67:43 - really fantastic
67:44 - and everything in in there is really
67:46 - really good so
67:47 - let's see who made this project mimik
67:49 - das excellent work dude
67:51 - really really nice to see that um let's
67:54 - go ahead and have a look
67:56 - at some of the comments um this face
67:58 - section
67:59 - okay so i see a lot of people actually
68:01 - recognize the face detection app so nice
68:03 - it's really cool to see that
68:05 - um you guys are awesome i tried the
68:07 - first time and it's up and running in
68:08 - one go awesome would love to see that
68:10 - when people are actually
68:11 - trying out our live sessions and
68:12 - following along with us and doing really
68:14 - well
68:15 - that is what we want to see and hear
68:17 - guys um
68:18 - really really great stuff okay so let's
68:20 - go ahead and have a look we have a
68:22 - grocery app
68:23 - let's go ahead and check that one out so
68:25 - we actually had
68:26 - actually one i wanted to see was the
68:29 - shopping app so we have a few here that
68:30 - have just come through we've got ui
68:32 - gradient
68:32 - cpu merge and guys yeah if you're new to
68:35 - this video right now
68:36 - make sure you've got a super chat whoa
68:39 - somebody actually just donated hey
68:41 - look at that thank you so much rishabh
68:43 - so let's go ahead and see
68:46 - so richard jane says hey snap it does
68:49 - create a screenshot for your code i
68:51 - accidentally pushed a buggy version some
68:53 - time back
68:54 - i just fixed it also how would you rate
68:57 - it so
68:58 - i just want to say guys this is rashab's
69:00 - code honestly this is
69:01 - dude this has really impressed me like
69:03 - i'm not joking this is something which
69:05 - i mean i've seen this and i actually
69:08 - feel like i'm gonna personally use this
69:10 - when i'm making some coding examples and
69:12 - things like that and the fact is that
69:13 - you coded this
69:14 - not just in javascript dude but in
69:17 - typescript like you went above and
69:18 - beyond
69:19 - that's what we want to see and i love to
69:21 - see that sort of like
69:23 - energy and let's go ahead and see that
69:24 - what happens if i resize this is it
69:26 - responsive
69:27 - let's go ahead and see like oh my god
69:29 - look he even made it responsive guys
69:32 - so like a minor minor issue with the the
69:34 - top
69:35 - and that but beyond that guys look at
69:37 - that the actual look at that he actually
69:39 - has a break point here which is going to
69:40 - detect
69:41 - that's what i'm talking about that's
69:43 - really really nice that you thought
69:44 - about that as well
69:46 - um so i just fixed it also how would you
69:48 - rate it i would personally
69:50 - i'm going to give this honestly i'm
69:51 - going to give this a 9. i'm going to
69:53 - give this a solid 9
69:54 - because in terms of the actual use case
69:56 - for it
69:57 - it's so handy like this is a really
69:59 - really handy tool to use and i can
70:01 - actually see
70:02 - how we can benefit from this and how we
70:03 - can actually go ahead and use this so
70:05 - this is amazing guys this is really
70:06 - really nice
70:07 - to see um let's go ahead and we've got
70:10 - clever programmer i love merge sort
70:12 - visualizer
70:13 - oh this is nice let's go ahead and see
70:15 - this what's this one so
70:17 - uh i just how do i um let me go ahead
70:20 - and
70:20 - unpin this one there we go nice
70:24 - so ten out of ten hey guys please share
70:26 - the game links of these projects with us
70:27 - i will try to guys there are a lot of
70:29 - projects here um
70:31 - the winners one i will go ahead and try
70:33 - and get the permission from the winner
70:34 - to go ahead and share that with you but
70:36 - let's carry on guys let's carry on with
70:37 - this let's go ahead and
70:39 - move forward so somebody actually
70:40 - submitted oh it's a shame this was
70:42 - actually one of those cool sort of merge
70:44 - sorting you know those merge sorting
70:45 - algorithm ones
70:46 - but they've gone ahead and given us the
70:48 - github link
70:50 - as the oops oh god this is horrible
70:52 - they've actually gone ahead and given us
70:54 - the github links instead
70:56 - um which is not actually the greatest
70:58 - thing because we can't actually go and
70:59 - see a live demo of the app
71:01 - so unfortunately i won't be able to look
71:03 - at that one because like i said guys
71:04 - you need to deploy your app in order for
71:06 - us to get this
71:08 - tested and go and see what's going on um
71:12 - right the github search engine i loved
71:14 - it but we just we don't have a
71:15 - live version of it up uh we don't have
71:17 - the github
71:18 - code there guys we have a photo gallery
71:21 - here let's go and check this one out
71:22 - let's go and check this one out here so
71:25 - we've got a nice little loading
71:26 - indicator we have a nice little photo
71:28 - album
71:28 - album so here if i type in like sun for
71:31 - sunny and then here oh nice
71:33 - that's pretty clean okay nice cool
71:36 - now let's go ahead and resize this to go
71:38 - ahead and see this okay
71:40 - that's what i like to see we have a
71:42 - small issue when it kind of gets to this
71:43 - break point but beyond that
71:45 - nice to see like look there you go i can
71:47 - see what the aim here was
71:48 - guys little trick for you you see how
71:50 - that image
71:51 - is getting stretched right whenever you
71:53 - have that if you go ahead and
71:55 - apply the following css rules so i'm
71:57 - going to go ahead here
71:58 - and open so this is something me and
72:00 - qazi went over the other day and
72:01 - he found it really useful so i think you
72:03 - guys might find this useful as well i'm
72:04 - going to go ahead and make this huge
72:06 - how do i make this pretty big so but but
72:08 - uh
72:09 - okay oh wow okay there we go much bigger
72:12 - so what i want you guys to do is go
72:13 - ahead and apply the following style when
72:15 - you see this issue
72:16 - so if you just want to select this so
72:18 - imagine you had your style here
72:19 - you're going to do object fit contain
72:22 - now if you do that guys you do object
72:24 - fit contain
72:26 - and you do width of okay so it's gonna
72:28 - just it's gonna do in this case it's
72:30 - gonna do it's just
72:30 - it will keep the aspect ratio so now
72:33 - look what happens so even if it like
72:34 - stretches in and gets smaller can you
72:37 - see how it doesn't stretch the image
72:38 - it will keep the aspect ratio that's
72:41 - really clean
72:42 - and that's really really the sort of the
72:43 - sort of the design and functionality
72:46 - that we want to go for when we are
72:48 - building these sort of apps okay
72:49 - so that's really really something that
72:51 - you guys want to be sure
72:52 - to be keen and make sure that you take
72:54 - into account but it's just a little top
72:55 - tip for you guys but this is a really
72:57 - nice project
72:58 - this is really really nice let's go
72:59 - ahead and check out the github for this
73:02 - uh let's go ahead and check out the
73:04 - github for this yep so
73:07 - we have a source and we have components
73:10 - inside of it so it's very
73:11 - fairly similar a simple app compared to
73:13 - the other ones we saw
73:14 - but nevertheless it's very clean guys
73:16 - very very clean build
73:18 - i'm gonna go and check out the image
73:19 - search here we have some es6 we have
73:22 - functional components here amazing stuff
73:24 - um nice to see that guys um
73:28 - i'm enough just popped out a good little
73:31 - uh
73:32 - comment here so it's very easy to style
73:34 - your react app with tail and css
73:36 - so if you guys actually are interested
73:38 - in tailwind css
73:40 - let us know in the comment section and i
73:41 - will be happy to sort of drop a video on
73:43 - that because
73:44 - i personally haven't used tailwind css
73:46 - much but i'd be more than happy to dive
73:48 - in and learn that so i can go ahead and
73:49 - bring some value to you guys
73:51 - um good comment uh amanath really nice
73:55 - you guys that you gave that one out um
73:57 - let's go ahead and have a
73:59 - look at this so carrying on so
74:04 - here we go guys here we go so we have
74:07 - the coding value we have heroku app ui
74:10 - typing speeding
74:11 - okay so typing speed game so ready to
74:14 - type let's go ahead and give this go so
74:16 - click and type so okay
74:17 - okay eight whoa z okay okay i'm trying
74:20 - three
74:21 - s w o b o
74:24 - but this should be a sentence right this
74:26 - is
74:28 - okay so i i mean i like it i do like it
74:31 - but it's more like a
74:32 - tap the letter game as opposed to a live
74:35 - game but
74:36 - right now i mean i would i would have
74:38 - found this pretty cool
74:39 - if it would have been a case of like i
74:41 - would typing out the actual words
74:43 - and then it would come up but overall
74:45 - very nice app and it's quite a clean
74:46 - looking ui
74:48 - um but let's continue on guys let's look
74:51 - and continue looking on so
74:52 - we had the face detection app we had a
74:54 - very nice shop that i'm trying to find
74:56 - so the grocery shop was cool but there
74:59 - was actually one here so i think it
75:00 - might have been this e-commerce one so
75:02 - we have the clothes shop
75:03 - the heroku app so i think this might be
75:05 - it guys so i'm gonna go ahead and close
75:07 - a bunch of these apps because i think
75:08 - they might actually be slowing things
75:09 - down
75:10 - so let's go ahead and close these apps
75:12 - oh okay so we're going to keep this one
75:13 - open because movie radar was on my top
75:15 - tier um this was one of the top apps for
75:18 - me so this one so the clothes shop
75:19 - heroku app
75:20 - this one is awesome guys so this one is
75:22 - actually really really cool
75:24 - uh and we can actually go ahead and if
75:25 - we go to the shop you can see that we've
75:27 - got all of the shop items so i actually
75:28 - demoed this one earlier on
75:30 - um and you can add some items to the
75:32 - shop and actually it persisted the data
75:34 - so i actually came back to the website
75:36 - and it kept track of my stuff that's
75:38 - really cool
75:39 - that's a really nice build please say
75:41 - okay and we have the app
75:42 - let's go ahead and let's go ahead and
75:44 - check this out so they actually they're
75:46 - using persistence
75:47 - so either for a data layer so here we
75:49 - have redux
75:51 - oh this is just this just got
75:53 - interesting we have
75:55 - redux inside this project guys so
75:58 - redux inside this project so here we
76:00 - have a reducer so let's go ahead and
76:01 - check out the reducer
76:03 - i'm not going to dive too much into
76:04 - redux because i feel like those of you
76:06 - who haven't used redux
76:07 - may get lost here but i'm going to
76:08 - quickly run through it he has
76:10 - set up his reducers very nicely and he
76:12 - split them up between the users
76:14 - the cart the directory and the shop so
76:16 - imagine like you have a data layer
76:18 - he split them up into four sections one
76:20 - for the user one for the cart one for
76:21 - the directory
76:22 - one for the shop okay um
76:25 - so that's what he's gone and done right
76:27 - here and let's go ahead and check out
76:29 - the components themselves
76:31 - so the components themselves are very
76:33 - nice layout here he's got a car
76:35 - the cart com car drop component.jsx

76:42 - um car items history cart action okay
76:45 - nice we have a bunch of stuff here he
76:48 - has
76:49 - his redux down at the bottom this is
76:51 - okay
76:52 - guys this is and he's using sass for his
76:55 - css
76:56 - right this is actually a this is a top
76:58 - contender right now guys because not
77:00 - only
77:00 - has this app gone above and beyond it
77:03 - also
77:04 - has a bunch of cool functionality in so
77:06 - if i want to go back to this app and go
77:08 - and check this heroku app out right now
77:10 - check this out guys so not only has it
77:12 - got this but we have sign in with google
77:14 - so it pops up with google sign in
77:16 - we have some sign up process here so
77:18 - let's go ahead and do like this so
77:20 - sssanga sunny gmail.com for example
77:23 - instead of abc abc
77:25 - submit boom there we go so the
77:28 - redirect's not working as such
77:30 - but he has some routing so you can see
77:31 - over here we have some routing going on
77:33 - over here so he's probably using react
77:35 - router in this case he's got some nice
77:38 - visuals here it's a responsive app
77:40 - really beautifully responsive app
77:42 - guys this is this is one of the top
77:44 - contenders i think honestly this is one
77:46 - of the top contenders
77:47 - we have sahil desai says you are love

78:01 - guys he even had stripe integrated
78:04 - right he even had stripe integrated so
78:06 - here we had like the billing information
78:08 - and then we processed the payment
78:09 - earlier
78:10 - that's really cool like that is a really
78:13 - cool use case i think
78:14 - right look at this we even have for the
78:17 - home page i mean
78:18 - it was a bit confusing because when i
78:19 - was on this page i didn't see that
78:21 - so i would have maybe flipped this
78:23 - design around and had it the other way
78:24 - around
78:25 - but here you can see guys men's section
78:28 - oh wow look at this hat section
78:30 - oh wow it's even categorized this dude's
78:33 - done pretty sick

78:38 - like this app damn
78:42 - okay so this carry on let's carry on so
78:45 - guys
78:45 - this is something which i i am
78:47 - definitely definitely considering to be
78:50 - a top contender here
78:51 - so this is one of the top contenders
78:53 - guys if you think so too and you agree
78:55 - with me
78:56 - then be sure to let me know in the
78:59 - comment section
78:59 - right now and i want you guys to write
79:02 - uh 0 to 10 and next to it write clothes
79:06 - app okay so 0 to 10 and next to it right
79:09 - close up or close or something so that
79:11 - way
79:11 - even though there's a little delay going
79:13 - on right now i can see what you guys are
79:15 - voting for okay
79:16 - so here we have the final contender so
79:19 - to prep it up to to sort of prepare this
79:22 - right now let's go ahead and let's go
79:25 - ahead and actually
79:27 - wrap up this sort of final contender so
79:29 - before we actually went ahead and we
79:31 - gathered some of the sort of projects
79:34 - that we thought
79:35 - matched the winning description for this
79:38 - project
79:38 - for this uh contest guys and we actually
79:41 - came up with a few
79:42 - right one of them was this clothes app
79:45 - right so this close up really did stand
79:46 - out beyond the rest
79:47 - it has authentication it has react
79:50 - context api has redux
79:52 - which is amazing um so this is
79:55 - number one this is like one of our top
79:57 - contenders right now so i'm just going
79:58 - to pull that to the side
80:00 - for a second and then we had another one
80:03 - which was the movie
80:06 - radar so the movie radar app so this one
80:09 - was another one which i
80:10 - really do enjoy and i really do love so
80:13 - let's go ahead and check out the
80:15 - so this is the app that i was talking
80:16 - about guys i forgot i wasn't showing my
80:17 - screen so
80:18 - we had the first app which was the
80:20 - clothing shopping
80:21 - so this is a top contender which has
80:23 - redux authentication a bunch of stuff
80:25 - and then we have the movie radar app
80:28 - which is insane
80:29 - as well i really do love this app and i
80:31 - think they've done an amazing job
80:33 - at taking pretty much what we taught
80:35 - maybe i'm not sure if you built this
80:37 - before you saw the netflix video but you
80:38 - took something which
80:39 - we had taught and you ran with it and
80:41 - you pretty much done really really well
80:42 - with that
80:43 - so amazing stuff right there awesome
80:46 - what i'm gonna do now is essentially go
80:49 - ahead and get the
80:50 - final so we have two contenders right
80:52 - here and
80:53 - the final one i think guys honestly it
80:56 - has to be
80:57 - the snap it up i mean this one just blew
81:00 - my mind when i saw it it was so nice
81:03 - so clean and i just it's such a
81:05 - functional use case like i think it's
81:07 - just such a good project
81:09 - like i really think it's a really good
81:10 - project like i know it's so simple but
81:13 - the thing is like every it really does
81:15 - get like a nice consistent sort of
81:17 - it's a very usable project right and i
81:19 - can see a lot of people are saying the
81:21 - live stream is lagging a little bit i'm
81:22 - sorry for that guys once it goes
81:24 - up it will be clearer and it should be
81:26 - the issue should be fixed
81:28 - okay and we shouldn't have this issue
81:30 - anymore um
81:32 - moving forward now so we have um let's
81:35 - go ahead
81:35 - and guys if it is lagging to you feel
81:37 - free to actually just rewind a little
81:38 - bit and then it can pretty much
81:40 - um if you want feel free to rewind a
81:43 - little bit and then you should actually
81:44 - avoid that buffer because you'll get
81:46 - by the time you get up to speed we would
81:48 - have crossed that issue with the
81:50 - connection
81:51 - okay so awesome so now what i'm going to
81:53 - go ahead and do is i'm going to close
81:54 - this one because that might be causing

but guys there were some projects that i saw that were submitted and it just kills me that you guys are forgetting to put your github urls if you forget to put your github urls i can't give you personalized video feedback on your code itself i can give you feedback on your website so look at this one guys just to sort of break it up and give you a little demo in between that so look look at this watch this watch this like it's like the images are scaling in look at that that is what i call responsive guys that is what i call responsive like how nice is that all right that is a really

going through them right so let's go ahead and wow guys check this out like we have a ton of submissions from you guys like this is just a few of the submissions that we have right now and you can see like it is full of everything that we have got right here so let's go ahead and check out the first one so here we have a todo app so i'm going to go ahead and open this up let's go ahead and give this a review so this is a todo app so here you go hello you are cool thank you very much we have full quad functionality apparently so let's go ahead and say this is a test update to do nice so it's actually working this is full quad functionality what i mean by crud is i can add a message so here i'm adding a todo so adding it to do and i click oh okay like adding a todo okay so guys did you see that you have to be careful with that honestly like when you have a form you have to make sure you call e dot prevent default to make sure that doesn't actually um that doesn't actually become the case so you don't actually want to have it so that bear with me one second guys you don't want to have it so that you accidentally um refresh your page because notice when i hit enter when i hit the enter key guys look what happens ah see we don't like that refreshing we don't like that refreshing also guys we like if you do build an app and you put this on your portfolio guys make sure that you style it okay like this is very like bare minimal basics and the problem with this kind of app is look if i go ahead and resize it i'm gonna start breaking things and now you have to be very careful here guys because this is the functionality is great so honestly keep up with the functionality um and let's go ahead and see who built this one so we have um abhishek dandriol so this is an amazing app bro but honestly make sure that you style it and make sure that you actually go ahead and add look even here we have i am a model so guys hey we don't want this we want a nice user experience but what's cool is that it's all persistent so i'm assuming this is on firebase so amazing stuff well done for doing that that's really really nice let's go ahead and move over to the next one uh let's go ahead and check out another one so we've here we've got name pro name proofer so let's go ahead and check this one so i'm just going to pull up the tables again so here we go we have a name proofer so an open source i can't see what it says an open source username availability checker nice so check out screenshot okay that's pretty cool so i'm assuming they're going to check all of these out and then we can go ahead and see that so let's go ahead and open this one up let's see let's see what this is about so while that's loading where can i submit my project for review click the link in the description bro and you can then submit your project and so there's a link in the description you can submit and you'll be brought to this page and you'll be able to submit your project over here so please go ahead and do that if you do want to be considered for winning this 100 prize so back to the project let's go here and now we can see that let's enter a username so let's say let's do demand so the man one two three and let's go ahead and check whoa check that out guys so it actually lights up and let's go ahead and do my username so this is my instagram right let's go and see what happens so if i do this check okay nice so they found like i think this means that they're going to be so signs are available silvers are taken greens are invalid but if i was to do this and check nice okay so i'm not sure the instagrams one's working okay apparently there was someone with that username nice so if i go ahead and do this right so i think no way somebody can't have that okay i mean maybe it's checking for a contains maybe it's checking here for that but the point is that's a really cool app guys that's really really nice so let's go ahead and check this out so we have dweep pancho so let's go ahead and dive into his code so i'm just going to go ahead and have a little check and firstly before i do that actually i just want to see if if we have a responsive site right now so let's go ahead and minimize this okay so you see here guys here what i would recommend is whenever you run into this problem make sure you guys make use of something called flexbox okay so in this case you see whenever you want to resize this stuff you want to be using something called flexbox and flexbox is going to allow you to have a responsive design so let's go ahead and check out that project what we talked about earlier which was uh this was blah blah blah i think i don't know if we have it open anymore um okay so it's not here but you see like whenever when i resize this one the app the website isn't gonna break right you see everything sort of starts to the images is shrinking correctly and everything works as it should flexbox is going to help you achieve that level of styling so back to uh the code for this project let's go ahead and have a look what he what did he use so we have app.js so let's go ahead and see here we have react so here we've got some you some hooks being used that's really really nice and we have a bunch of hooks being used this is awesome he uses some regex which is nice we have so this is some clean code right here so like here we have like some so a bunch of different promises this is a very nice way of handling this um okay this is really cool i think what you could do in this case is if you've got you see here guys we have a bunch of like repeated what seems to look like oh okay no it's not it's because we have different different um hooks being used but this is awesome this is really really nice i would recommend when your code starts to get past you see like here it's getting past the hundred hundred sort of uh 100 mark in terms of how many lines of code at this point guys i would really recommend that you go ahead and start refactoring so use like 100 as your sort of cut off you can actually start probably most likely refactoring most of this into separate components and you should be able to actually get ahead and make this code much more readable and maintainable but let's see how he's done his styling so guys i'm not a huge fan when it comes to doing inline styles right so i noticed here he's got class names of color descending but you see right here we have a mixture of css styling so this is going to be styled in a css file but then this is called an inline style right so inline oops inline style and the problem with this guys is that you have a mix and not only do you have a mix inline styles take precedence so these ones take so if let's say i have the same rule and then the css file and in the inline style the inline style wins okay the inline style is the one that takes precedence now when you when that you start to do that kind of stuff you're going to run into issues because you're gonna start having rules in your css file that aren't gonna be you think that they're not gonna be listened to when in reality you're just overwriting it with with this so this will actually go ahead and overwrite any css rules apologize for my handwriting guys i'm a coder i'm not the best drawer so there we go so here you can see like you're gonna have problems with that so just a little tip right there but in all honesty this is pretty cool this is actually a pretty nice project um we're going to just we're not going to dive too far deep into some of these but i like how he separated things out here we have a backend.js file which is nice so he has he's using process.n to keep his credentials very safe and secure which is really nice um so that's awesome so let's go ahead and jump out of this one so that's really nice and guys what do you guys think of this project so let me know in the comments now let me know in the comment section by dropping a number between 0 and 10 10 being amazing project like this thing it blew my mind and a zero being yeah you know we could do better but in this in this case i'll give this a solid sort of around the 7 mark because that's a pretty cool that's a pretty cool app right that's a pretty cool app so let me know in the comments what you guys think and if you're enjoying that smash the thumbs up button so let's go ahead and i'll keep an eye on the comment section as we go ahead and and we've got a nice little comment here saying hey sonny this is awesome thanks for doing reviews you are welcome dude and we will be happy to do this more often if you guys find it useful okay so let's go ahead and see so we've got eight five six okay so somebody gave it eight okay nice so somebody said hey it's honey big bro you are amazing we have a few numbers here we have a mix we have availa storm gave it an eight that's interesting nice so a lot of these i can see coming in at seven seven okay so nice seven six so let's give it let's give that one i would say a solid let's give it a six i think a six purely the reason why i'm gonna give this one a six is because the use case was amazing guys but the responsive design just didn't get me here right it just didn't didn't get me here and in terms of what we could have done is such a nice app guys it's a really really nice app but the responsiveness of the website let me down a little bit in terms of if i go ahead and change this to a mobile phone then again it does work pretty decent on a mobile phone let's go ahead and check an iphone okay but you see it starts to crop off and it could look amazing if we just use flexbox guys it could look so so nice and it could be really really good if we just used a bit of flexbox here um so let's go ahead and uh let me actually see if i could do something right now for you guys okay so we're not going to do that but oh here's using flexbox but i think the problem here guys is you should put all of these inside of one flexbox container so whenever you're using flexbox put all of these in one container and then apply your flex rules and then they would have been listed in a beautiful nice way um but yes let's give this one a solid seven let's give it a seven okay so moving on let's go ahead and check out some more of your guys projects so let me just make sure that i'm not going to post anything weird on the screen so let me go and check this out give me one second guys i'm pulling up all of your beautiful projects right now okay so oh here we go there you go let's unpin that one nice um okay here we go nice so i'm gonna go ahead and open up the grid view so there we go let's go ahead and have a look so now we have let's go and check out we've got the chat app i've seen a bunch of these chats so i'm going to pick something slightly different because guys we have a bunch to get through here today uh we have the amazon clone amazing to see that guys amazing to see that portfolio we have a realtime chat we have a movie radar interesting okay movie raider this is pretty cool let's go ahead and look at this one so you see what i mean guys there's some things that stand out like something which stands out is going to get my attention when it comes to this stuff um right nice this is pretty clean this is freaking please be responsive please i want this to be oh nice okay all right we have some responsive design right now so if i go ahead and click make this responsive look at this guys that's what i'm talking about that's exactly what i'm talking about that is what i call a clean look and fill look at that as it gets bigger it's splitting to a four a three a two and a one that's awesome if we go ahead and click this look at that it's really nice ui go ahead and click popular nice okay that's pretty cool and we get upcoming titles awesome now let's go ahead and click on watch trailer look at this guys he even puts the banner down here this is this is pretty nice it's pretty clean click play trailer and it renders the youtube video so this is actually really good i'm actually quite i like this one so let's go ahead and test something right now so here we have a film called the hunt so let's go ahead and use his search bar and type in the hunt nice look at that guys it's actually searching for everything with the honey let's go ahead and type in um i don't know let's just say journey so let's say journey or something like look a dog's journey the hobbit journey to the mysterious island nice this is a cool app this is a really nice app guys let's go ahead and see what the comments are saying about this this live streams oh nice i love stuff like that guys this live stream inspired me to learn and react i love that guys if you're enjoying it and if anyone else has been inspired by this smash the thumbs up button and let me know if you're psyched to carry one with these live streams and let's carry on going um so somebody says are you from england yes yes i am from england great question right so carrying on with the the the review so let's go ahead and dive into the code for this right so here we have g and this was by jean daniel d saw amazing work right here by gene daniel deities and let's go ahead and see so this was built with create react app so awesome stuff really nice to see that and you've used yarn i see so nice okay uh and let's go ahead and check the source okay firstly guys i really like how she split things up we've got an api inside of one photo we've got components containers really clean that's a good that's a good little pattern right here we've got images styles views and so forth let's go ahead and check the uh components this is what i like to see i like to see things when they're very like neatly organized we have movie details search components let's go ahead and check the card component this is what i'm talking about guys this is what you want you want isolated components you want small isolated components that you can upgrade and get things and you can build and add on top of right so we have a la quinley sorry if i pronounce that wrong thank you so much brother for the love and i really appreciate you being here right now and checking this out um okay so let's carry on with the review so let's go ahead and check out one of the components so here we have an example of the component so firstly very nice to see that they are using they are actually using a bunch of hooks so here we have a hook here we have prop types which is really nice so the prop types if you guys don't know enforce uh what a prop should be so imagine you had a bunch of props coming into your app so props props props here you would say basically like uh what the type of the prop was whether it was a number or whether it was a string so prop types is pretty much going to basically allow you to go ahead so let me go ahead and cut that oops let's go ahead and get that so prop types is going to allow you to enforce what type your prop should be so if it should be a string if it should be a number if it should be an object etc uh really really nice comments here by the way guys inspired you by your live streams awesome work thank you very much man um okay so let's go ahead and carry on so we've got a really nice this is called a destructuring so really nice to see some es6 functions right here uh and nice look at this guys he's even got this is some really really cool um this guy has been developing for a bit i can tell because he's got some very very nicely laid out code and he's using a a a library that concatenates classes called class names i've used class names before guys so this is actually a really really solid project so far so let's go ahead and check out movie details and let's go ahead and see this so here we have some more stuff there's some more styles right here we've got a so he's getting it from tmdb so awesome stuff tmdb is how we actually built the netflix clone so this phone that you see right here is pulling from the tmdb api so that's really really cool to see that um awesome so here we have axios axios is being used to make our requests to the api and that's awesome to see guys so he actually has props and he does console logs make sure you do clean up your console logs guys so when you do want to sort of submit your code make sure you don't leave any sort of over overhanging uh console logs in your project also i would recommend using prettier so you see here we have this white space very small issue but priya will help you get rid of that now here guys i recommend you see like we've got all of these sort of names right you've got class name you've got this class name you've got other class names something i really recommend that everyone goes and learns for all of to handle all of your class naming issues is something called bem right so i'm going to go ahead and uh let me just draw on the screen right now let's go ahead and draw this so guys if you want to get this nailed down and you want this to look clean as hell then i would recommend everybody goes and learns them class name convention so it's a convention um and that you got i recommend all of you guys go and learn and basically what it is is bem css so let's go ahead and check out bem it stands for block element modifier right now i know a lot of you guys thinking oh i have no idea what that means but i recommend that everyone goes ahead and checks out this website so it's pretty much bam so go ahead over to getbem.com and this will teach you how to name your classes right and it's very very good especially when you're doing uh react development okay so it's really really good when you do a reactive development so make sure that you guys go ahead and check that out okay um let's go ahead and see if the stream is good okay so everything seems to be okay right now everyone's saying the stream is lagging i apologize if the stream is lagging guys hopefully it clears up soon um but let's go ahead and back to the app so what i might do at this point is rather than going through the code of every single one let's go ahead and test the traits of different apps okay and then what we can do is the ones that make it to the sort of top tier level then ones we can actually go ahead and then ones we can go actually go ahead and give them a ranking from one stand so for this app guys i think this is a solid build i think this is a really nice app let's go ahead and give this a ranking between zero and ten guys i honestly think this is this is up there guys so let me know in the comments what you guys are thinking about this app right here guys let me know what you're thinking about this app because this is amazing and i will be dropping personalized video feedback for this exact app because this is a really really cool project here um which i actually i really like the front end i like how he's done it's got some really nice um styling on this page so let's go ahead and drop in the comment section below what we think this deserves in terms of a ranking i'm gonna give this in the meantime i'm gonna give this maybe an eight or a nine this is this is a good app right this is a really cool app okay so let's go ahead and check out some more projects so let's go see we have a bunch of different we have netflix clowns i'm going to try and check out the apps that we didn't actually build in the live streams so i want to go ahead and do something that we we haven't built in the live streams and hopefully guys that would actually help you guys um go ahead and get some more exposure to different kind of apps so all of the other apps here so you see this one so here we have a todo app portfolio so let's go ahead and check let's go have a look at this portfolio let's go and see what this one is about right let's go and see so here we go we got hello world i'm sea walk sand you a web developer awesome so somebody else just said your live stream sessions really motivated me to code react that's awesome to see thank you so much for your support and appreciate you guys being here right now um let's go have a look and let's go a bit down and see what we have right now so a lot of people asking what is my instagram id so if you are wondering guys just a quick shout is here is my instagram tag on the right so if you guys want to go ahead and follow me and you want to go sort of post a story and let me know how you're finding this video so far be sure to shoot a video on instagram and tag me and cleverkazy and thank the rest of the team if you know who they are nars jacob if you guys want to see them and you want to get there and a sort of conversation with them then be sure to tag them and we guys and we can start a conversation from that but let's go and have a look and jump into this um portfolio right here so i can't actually seem to scroll down oh let's go have a look we've got we've got a drop down right here we've got education and skills let's see um okay it says the stream is buffering so it's apologies guys if it is cutting out at all um but it should be clearing up soon okay so here you can see we've got a really nice portfolio actually over here but you see it seems to it seems to cut off underneath here so i mean okay so this is the latest but you see like small small things guys we want to make sure let me go ahead and check something yeah small small things guys we want to make sure that we aren't actually um that we aren't actually having design flaws like this right um so i see that the issue yeah so there is a bit of lag here guys i apologize for the delay but um hopefully guys we i'm actually going to go ahead and carry on with this video and what we can do is i will actually go ahead and review these myself and the stream should catch up by the time we go ahead and get started okay so let's go back and check this out so this app is pretty nice we have a very nice ui but again guys i don't like it when we can't scroll down like it looks beautiful it looks really nice but it's just a case of i can't like i have to click that little drop down in order to navigate the website and only then like you see there's a bunch of really cool apps here there's a music player which is really nice i can go ahead and click this so this i like this is really cool wow this is really cool now this is a really nice app and here you can see and let's go ahead and check if it's actually responsive so this is actually a very cool so you see right now he's got some overflow here which is nice but there's a little bit of a glitch here with the with the sort of um let's go ahead and click play oh nice so it actually goes ahead someplace nice that's pretty cool nice to see that okay so i can actually see a lot of people's coming in uh comments finally coming in about the movie app i can see nines and tens okay that is really cool to see guys so that movie app that we just demoed this one over here i believe everyone has given this a nine or a ten so that's actually that's pretty cool guys and that's really up there um this app right here is pretty cool as well but i don't i'm not a big fan of the user experience on this page it looks really nice but i have to click this top left awkward link to be able to get here so it's not a biggest fan of that guys not the biggest fan of that it should be very simple and i should just be able to scroll on my mouse um but i can't seem to get anywhere with it so you want to be careful of things like that when it comes to designing your apps um so having another look through this let's go ahead and jump into the gear no this is what i meant guys here we have an amazing github search app with some amazing functionality so this is the one i demoed earlier so sunny sanger we go ahead and click search this app's really nice like it's really really cool i would have loved to have seen the code for this i really really wouldn't love so let's go ahead and view his repositories and let's go ahead and see if we can actually get um some ah damn it so ahmed but lady if you are here then be sure to actually please please please maybe reupload with the code base because i would love to go and check your code and see how you did that right that would be an awesome thing to see and it'll be really really nice to see um how that goes um so moving on let's have a look at here we have snap it what is that so let's go ahead and check a screenshot validate email so let's go ahead and check this link out snap it so we here we have okay interesting oh nice okay look at this we actually have a little code terminal guys this is pretty cool this is pretty nice so look at this we have different coding languages here so let's go ahead and do javascript and let's go ahead and write some javascript in here so if i was to do like const name equals sunny that's pretty cool that's pretty cool and look at that if i was to go ahead and choose a completely different language like my sequel okay so it actually does okay i think what would make this app even better is if we had some some code which was actually rendered every time so you but you see it's got syntax highlight which is pretty cool but different code examples would be really nice for this but i can see the use case for this guys so let's go ahead and do css and if i was to get rid of this and do something like this now let's just say like let's just call it like um button class and you can see like let's go ahead and do something like display oh let's do background color white right well i think you just do it like this yeah background color white and you could do like font size equals like 20 pixels so this is awesome guys so like imagine you had this and then you had something like the button delete variant and let's say you had the button this is bem styles uh convention by the way what i'm doing here so you have the delete button and then we could also do something like the add button or something like that and then this one could have 22 3 pixels we've got 26 pixels and for example what you could then go ahead and do is just snap that so you can go ahead and screenshot that and you have a nice little thing so if i click snap it i wonder what that does does that actually post something into my okay i wonder what that snap does that would be nice if you actually sort of just like took a picture and maybe saved it as a download that would be kind of cool but that's really cool to see guys i like to see different use cases for that let's go ahead and check the code for that one let's go ahead and check the code for that one so amerban hello how's it going so that is my beautiful girlfriend i have not forgotten about you and thank you for always supporting me on these live calls love you to pieces and yeah there you go thank you ma i'm not for shouting that one out nice um i'm a knob says he's now in love with react i've always been in love with reactor i'm not it's always it's just one of those things all right so carrying on let's have a look at that code base we have source let's go ahead and look at this so here we have oh nice so here we actually have a context api so we have some a reducer here so we've actually got a date adobe and he's using typescript oh my god guys he's using typescript this is amazing i love to see projects that are using typescript and he's got a fullon reducer this is really nice and guys for a simple project because in for something which looks fairly simple he's actually built this out really nice he's got components with a folder structure here which makes a lot of sense we have a header here and you can see he's got a title and he's passing in oh my god and he's even using memo from react wow okay this is really really cool to see guys so if many of you guys who don't know about typescript typescript is basically what we call a superset so it sits on top of javascript and it allows you to have something called strongly typed like basically that type definition so it allows you to say if a variable is a string or if a variable is a number or if a variable is an object or array etcetera and it really will enforce that so it will prevent it from actually becoming a case where we have issues um where for example you're expecting a string and you get a number or you're expecting an object and you get an array typescript is going to allow you and force you to essentially have the correct data types it also gives you really good auto completion so the fact is that we saw that in here is really really nice to see um so let's go ahead and look through his code some more we have reducers tailwind okay really nice to see that app.tsx i love seeing app.tsx guys um because i know it's then in a typescript layout so i haven't got any fancy typescript stuff over here um let's go ahead and check out pages snap it dot tsx so quick mention guys i love it when i say oh my god he's even using used callback this is so cool and he's got the right type definitions for a select element okay this is very very powerful guys so for those of you who are new to typescript this may not make a lot of sense but what he's doing is he's using the the latest sort of react hook so he's got use state use callback use fetch context that's a new one interesting i haven't seen that one before but basically guys this and even use memo wow use memo guys is basically whenever we have an expensive sort of calculation in our code so for example if we have to map out a massive list of things then use memo essentially kind of kind of like it's like a cache which means that like if it loads it once and it takes ages to load it right it's going to just cache it and it's going to basically it's going to cache it and then it's going to essentially see um so let's go ahead it's going to catch it yeah and it's going to cache it and it's basically going to have it so that the next time it needs that element it doesn't need to rerender right it doesn't need to rerender it doesn't need to do all of those things it's actually just going to basically use whatever it just previously rendered unless the dependencies inside of this little square brackets change you'll notice this pattern um quite a lot in react and you'll see this more and more often where you have oops where you have uh you'll see this pattern more often wherever you where you need like a dependency to put inside of a hook for example we see that a lot in the use effect hook okay so yo sunny i can see you so we've actually got the clever programmer team shouting onto the page right now um awesome all right guys bear in mind yo is that code yeah i know right so here like we've got the team shouting out that the code terminal snap is lit and it is guys it is crazy and also guys if your comments are being delayed it is most likely because of the live stream so i can see a bunch of comments coming through but it seems like everybody thinks i'm not responding in time there is a little delay here guys so just be aware of that but yeah moving over to the snap it terminal this thing is crazy i think this is such a cool thing to see guys and it's actually such a clever use case i think we might we might actually use this like i find this a really really useful awkward moment when kazi is watching your live stream kazi what's up dude if everyone wants to give kazzy a shout out go ahead and drop him some love in the comment section yo where am i i'm not in the live stream awesome to see that oh man let's go ahead um how do i i think i've double it oh there we go nice so guys yeah i think this is actually a really cool one so let's go ahead and drop some fire for this uh project right here and if you guys want to drop a ranking from 0 to 10 where 10 is like holy crap i need this app in my life and where zero is like man we could do better than this i personally am going to give this this is hand in hand next to that movie app that we saw earlier so right now we have a pretty close battle here with the movie app and the snap it app i'm really liking bowfish but this one guys is using typescript so this one i love it for one main reason and that is we have typescript so not only is the use case really really cool but we have typescript which is an amazing superset of javascript and it basically just supercharges our code base so i'd recommend everyone goes ahead and checks that out okay so moving over to the next project um i thought so we have amino is a freaking legend shout out to my beautiful girlfriend lovely uh so let's go ahead and carry on so we have the oh wow dude we have a face detection app let's go let's check this one out let's go and see if this works okay so we have an image url so let me go ahead and pick an image um over here so let me go ahead and pick an image right here give me one second guys if i go detect enter image url so i need an image url so let's go ahead and drop it in here so so let's go ahead and boom oops there we go image url is going to be let's go ahead and grab an image of google's let's just go and say it ahead and say let's say steve jobs let's go get a picture of stevie let's see if it does face detection on steve jobs so let's go and grab a picture of steve and let's go again get this one copy image address and let's go back to oh my god i have so many tabs face detection and let's enter the image url boom detect what the hell that is cool guys if you guys like that app then drop some fire like that's pretty cool let's go ahead and do another one damn that's that's really nice guys i love seeing this i love seeing this i'm really just ah like i said guys i would love to see the github repo url for this because unfortunately i just i mean it's such a good use case but i need to see the code for that if i want to pick a winner for this but um amazing amazing let's go ahead and do another let's do mark zuckerberg and let's do let's make a harder one so this one he's standing a bit further back so let's go ahead and do copy image address and let's go ahead and not this one not this one not this let's do this one so detect okay oh wow that's insane yo that that's pretty cool that is that is pretty cool to see stuff like that i mean like damn it damn it i love seeing stuff like oh man that's a pretty cool app okay so guys let me know zero to ten on this app like oh i love it and look at the background guys i love seeing this like this little cool techie background i've seen this before as well if we change the width of this i wonder if that will actually make a difference okay awesome that's actually pretty cool okay so a nice nice use case there by md jamil kashem so really awesome stuff there dude uh we have a react lyrics app doh we haven't got the code we haven't got the github repo url so guys i really do want to see your code whenever you code this stuff so please please please do let me know so let's do a track name let's see what songs do i like uh let's go ahead and do let's do chris brown let's go and see chris brown yeah oh yeah we have some songs over here so let's do um do it okay i like this song this is pretty good oh nice we actually got the lyrics for it okay oh wait a minute there's some indian there's some punjabi oh going over here i didn't remember hearing that in the song um zach knight okay interesting so you have explicit no so we was actually pulling a bunch of sauces lyrics powdered powered by music match lyrics is not permission okay nice so i'm assuming this is pulling it from an api right here and actually we're actually using some code to do this but i can't see the code so unfortunately can't dive into that anymore so right now guys we have a nice little battle so so cozy we need to get sunny an internet connection it doesn't turn into a wooden potato yeah we do guys this needs to be fixed up and i will be looking into a connection that will get this up and peeked out because we had nearly had 700 people on this on this thing which is insane right uh okay let's go ahead and check it out right so a few more apps to look at so we have webdevs.com i think i saw that one it was a sort of uh directory let's go ahead covet 19 tracker okay let's keep going so kovid 19 tracker by my nan so my nan sha some fire right here guys because i'm gonna open this one up and i really do okay so we have this one this one i really like this is all on one page right so we have afghanistan let's go ahead and check that out we've got a few here so austria but guys this one is amazing so good work but uh manan sorry not sure but i saw something else which was just like an enhanced version of this by mamik das okay oh i wasn't sharing my screen sorry about that guys so the first one i mentioned was this one right here the kovid 19 tracker so argentina you see this like look dynamically updates the stats everything gets pushed out which is that's really cool right but we have that and then we also have this one which is covid info i think this is the one i was meant thinking about earlier so let's go ahead and check this one out it also might be slowing down because i've got a bunch of things opening on there but you see we have this really nice looking website and guys something i loved about this was is it responsive let's go ahead and check out is it responsive okay so uh let's go ahead and see so right let's go ahead and make this smaller look at that guys so firstly that's really nice and responsive let's see if we get the break point big enough it gets bigger it gets bigger it gets bigger oh snap nice so notice guys how if i draw around this so let's go ahead and pay attention to this section right here we pay attention to that section right here watch what happens when i resize so look at this movement snap nice that's amazing to see that we have a drop down instead now let's go ahead and check out the stats section and we hear we have the exact same sort of similar layout that we saw in the previous build um so really really nice they must be using the same similar library here or pulling this from somewhere but this is really nice to see so we have current stats and then on the international scale we have a really nice diagram which shows us all of the stats we have frequently asked questions this isn't this is insane this is actually a really cool use case for an app so i'm just going to go ahead and check out the code base for this so let's go ahead and check out the code base for this um let's go and see so we have source and here we have an api we have components and we have the images so i'm hoping that the components are broken up nice okay so the components are broken up in different photos we have cards.js so here we have some functional components which is awesome to see we have a react loader spinner i love uh libraries like this they're quite cool they allow you to have a little cool spinner when things are loading um which is dope um so it's carrying on and i can see here we're using bootstrap so nice he's using bootstrap guys i'm personally i mean like let me know what your thoughts are on bootstrap right so i'm kind of i'm kind of in between on it right so and i can see the numbers are now coming through for the previous project that we spoke about um so the snap it we saw some nines we saw some tams damn guys so i think it was not snap it we were talking about the face tracker so that's insane guys so i saw some tens come through because remember we are a bit delayed on the comments and live stream chat which is insane um i'm a bit i'm a bit like back and forth on bootstrap let me know in the comment section it's bit of a controversial topic some people love it some people hate it i'm on the fence i kind of wrestle with bootstrap when i use bootstrap i'm kind of fighting with it to get my rules in place instead of bootstrap rules so if you find that this is sort of like you find this issue too let me know in the comment section because i want to know if am i alone in this like do i am i the only one who fights with bootstrap or do you guys have that issue too if you do let me know in the comment section and if you guys are enjoying this remember smash the thumbs up button because it's always nice to get this video out to as many people as we possibly can to provide value to as many of you guys as we possibly can okay so let's carry on with this review so this is a really really cool app guys the kovid tracker here we have some very nice code he's used bootstrap very nicely we have the country selector so let's go ahead and check this one out and here you can see look here's how he is fetching it so he's using an async core and each side of the use effect and guys i don't tend to okay so this is something which i spot quite fairly a few amount of times we don't actually want to put the modifier so this set fetch countries inside of our dependencies you only want to put a raise like as in not array so you only want to put the actual variables here okay so you only want to put the variables of things here right because when you put this this is the function that we use to actually modify so what we're saying is we're saying fire off this code every time the function changes but the function isn't ever going to change it's going to be the variable so it's going to be fetched countries so in fact what we should be doing here is i mean right at this point we should actually be leaving this maybe blank we shouldn't actually be using this um we shouldn't actually we don't actually seem to have any dependencies here um that need to be in this block so i would actually go ahead and remove this because we don't actually need this okay uh also i just wanted to shout out some comments right now so i can see a reef islam effect says sunny i like your teaching style it makes me more serious about react.js thank you amazing to see that i really really do love when i see comments like this it's really a great

okay let's go ahead and carry on with the review so this one right here is an amazing project guys the kovid tracker so i just want to get some some numbers here guys so this one is a really clean build for me i even like how they've designed it over here like you see it's very nice i mean there was one element which i wasn't a fan of which was this like i'm not sure why we have this massive gap underneath here but i mean it's not the it's not the worst issue it's just the case of the user experience here was just slightly off just a tiny bit off by that small like i don't know why we have this gap but beyond that also look at this guys look news look at this little loader so this is asynchronous work at hand here really really nice loader here and um yeah so this is awesome so here we have some news about kovi 19 unfortunately it's not the best news but the reality is is the code itself is great and it looks really fantastic and everything in in there is really really good so let's see who made this project mimik das excellent work dude really really nice to see that um let's go ahead and have a look at some of the comments um this face section okay so i see a lot of people actually recognize the face detection app so nice it's really cool to see that um you guys are awesome i tried the first time and it's up and running in one go awesome would love to see that when people are actually trying out our live sessions and following along with us and doing really well that is what we want to see and hear guys um really really great stuff okay so let's go ahead and have a look we have a grocery app let's go ahead and check that one out so we actually had actually one i wanted to see was the shopping app so we have a few here that have just come through we've got ui gradient cpu merge and guys yeah if you're new to this video right now make sure you've got a super chat whoa somebody actually just donated hey look at that thank you so much rishabh so let's go ahead and see so richard jane says hey snap it does create a screenshot for your code i accidentally pushed a buggy version some time back i just fixed it also how would you rate it so i just want to say guys this is rashab's code honestly this is dude this has really impressed me like i'm not joking this is something which i mean i've seen this and i actually feel like i'm gonna personally use this when i'm making some coding examples and things like that and the fact is that you coded this not just in javascript dude but in typescript like you went above and beyond that's what we want to see and i love to see that sort of like energy and let's go ahead and see that what happens if i resize this is it responsive let's go ahead and see like oh my god look he even made it responsive guys so like a minor minor issue with the the top and that but beyond that guys look at that the actual look at that he actually has a break point here which is going to detect that's what i'm talking about that's really really nice that you thought about that as well um so i just fixed it also how would you rate it i would personally i'm going to give this honestly i'm going to give this a 9. i'm going to give this a solid 9 because in terms of the actual use case for it it's so handy like this is a really really handy tool to use and i can actually see how we can benefit from this and how we can actually go ahead and use this so this is amazing guys this is really really nice to see um let's go ahead and we've got clever programmer i love merge sort visualizer oh this is nice let's go ahead and see this what's this one so uh i just how do i um let me go ahead and unpin this one there we go nice so ten out of ten hey guys please share the game links of these projects with us i will try to guys there are a lot of projects here um the winners one i will go ahead and try and get the permission from the winner to go ahead and share that with you but let's carry on guys let's carry on with this let's go ahead and move forward so somebody actually submitted oh it's a shame this was actually one of those cool sort of merge sorting you know those merge sorting algorithm ones but they've gone ahead and given us the github link as the oops oh god this is horrible they've actually gone ahead and given us the github links instead um which is not actually the greatest thing because we can't actually go and see a live demo of the app so unfortunately i won't be able to look at that one because like i said guys you need to deploy your app in order for us to get this tested and go and see what's going on um right the github search engine i loved it but we just we don't have a live version of it up uh we don't have the github code there guys we have a photo gallery here let's go and check this one out let's go and check this one out here so we've got a nice little loading indicator we have a nice little photo album album so here if i type in like sun for sunny and then here oh nice that's pretty clean okay nice cool now let's go ahead and resize this to go ahead and see this okay that's what i like to see we have a small issue when it kind of gets to this break point but beyond that nice to see like look there you go i can see what the aim here was guys little trick for you you see how that image is getting stretched right whenever you have that if you go ahead and apply the following css rules so i'm going to go ahead here and open so this is something me and qazi went over the other day and he found it really useful so i think you guys might find this useful as well i'm going to go ahead and make this huge how do i make this pretty big so but but uh okay oh wow okay there we go much bigger so what i want you guys to do is go ahead and apply the following style when you see this issue so if you just want to select this so imagine you had your style here you're going to do object fit contain now if you do that guys you do object fit contain and you do width of okay so it's gonna just it's gonna do in this case it's gonna do it's just it will keep the aspect ratio so now look what happens so even if it like stretches in and gets smaller can you see how it doesn't stretch the image it will keep the aspect ratio that's really clean and that's really really the sort of the sort of the design and functionality that we want to go for when we are building these sort of apps okay so that's really really something that you guys want to be sure to be keen and make sure that you take into account but it's just a little top tip for you guys but this is a really nice project this is really really nice let's go ahead and check out the github for this uh let's go ahead and check out the github for this yep so we have a source and we have components inside of it so it's very fairly similar a simple app compared to the other ones we saw but nevertheless it's very clean guys very very clean build i'm gonna go and check out the image search here we have some es6 we have functional components here amazing stuff um nice to see that guys um i'm enough just popped out a good little uh comment here so it's very easy to style your react app with tail and css so if you guys actually are interested in tailwind css let us know in the comment section and i will be happy to sort of drop a video on that because i personally haven't used tailwind css much but i'd be more than happy to dive in and learn that so i can go ahead and bring some value to you guys um good comment uh amanath really nice you guys that you gave that one out um let's go ahead and have a look at this so carrying on so here we go guys here we go so we have the coding value we have heroku app ui typing speeding okay so typing speed game so ready to type let's go ahead and give this go so click and type so okay okay eight whoa z okay okay i'm trying three s w o b o but this should be a sentence right this is okay so i i mean i like it i do like it but it's more like a tap the letter game as opposed to a live game but right now i mean i would i would have found this pretty cool if it would have been a case of like i would typing out the actual words and then it would come up but overall very nice app and it's quite a clean looking ui um but let's continue on guys let's look and continue looking on so we had the face detection app we had a very nice shop that i'm trying to find so the grocery shop was cool but there was actually one here so i think it might have been this ecommerce one so we have the clothes shop the heroku app so i think this might be it guys so i'm gonna go ahead and close a bunch of these apps because i think they might actually be slowing things down so let's go ahead and close these apps oh okay so we're going to keep this one open because movie radar was on my top tier um this was one of the top apps for me so this one so the clothes shop heroku app this one is awesome guys so this one is actually really really cool uh and we can actually go ahead and if we go to the shop you can see that we've got all of the shop items so i actually demoed this one earlier on um and you can add some items to the shop and actually it persisted the data so i actually came back to the website and it kept track of my stuff that's really cool that's a really nice build please say okay and we have the app let's go ahead and let's go ahead and check this out so they actually they're using persistence so either for a data layer so here we have redux oh this is just this just got interesting we have redux inside this project guys so redux inside this project so here we have a reducer so let's go ahead and check out the reducer i'm not going to dive too much into redux because i feel like those of you who haven't used redux may get lost here but i'm going to quickly run through it he has set up his reducers very nicely and he split them up between the users the cart the directory and the shop so imagine like you have a data layer he split them up into four sections one for the user one for the cart one for the directory one for the shop okay um so that's what he's gone and done right here and let's go ahead and check out the components themselves so the components themselves are very nice layout here he's got a car the cart com car drop component.jsx awesome stuff so here we actually have um car items history cart action okay nice we have a bunch of stuff here he has his redux down at the bottom this is okay guys this is and he's using sass for his css right this is actually a this is a top contender right now guys because not only has this app gone above and beyond it also has a bunch of cool functionality in so if i want to go back to this app and go and check this heroku app out right now check this out guys so not only has it got this but we have sign in with google so it pops up with google sign in we have some sign up process here so let's go ahead and do like this so sssanga sunny gmail.com for example instead of abc abc submit boom there we go so the redirect's not working as such but he has some routing so you can see over here we have some routing going on over here so he's probably using react router in this case he's got some nice visuals here it's a responsive app really beautifully responsive app guys this is this is one of the top contenders i think honestly this is one of the top contenders we have sahil desai says you are love sonny really appreciate the support dude thank you for watching love you guys too um let's carry on with this build so here we have uh so you have authentication we have this guys he even had stripe integrated right he even had stripe integrated so here we had like the billing information and then we processed the payment earlier that's really cool like that is a really cool use case i think right look at this we even have for the home page i mean it was a bit confusing because when i was on this page i didn't see that so i would have maybe flipped this design around and had it the other way around but here you can see guys men's section oh wow look at this hat section oh wow it's even categorized this dude's done pretty sick nice this is really nice i really do like this app damn okay so this carry on let's carry on so guys this is something which i i am definitely definitely considering to be a top contender here so this is one of the top contenders guys if you think so too and you agree with me then be sure to let me know in the comment section right now and i want you guys to write uh 0 to 10 and next to it write clothes app okay so 0 to 10 and next to it right close up or close or something so that way even though there's a little delay going on right now i can see what you guys are voting for okay so here we have the final contender so to prep it up to to sort of prepare this right now let's go ahead and let's go ahead and actually wrap up this sort of final contender so before we actually went ahead and we gathered some of the sort of projects that we thought matched the winning description for this project for this uh contest guys and we actually came up with a few right one of them was this clothes app right so this close up really did stand out beyond the rest it has authentication it has react context api has redux which is amazing um so this is number one this is like one of our top contenders right now so i'm just going to pull that to the side for a second and then we had another one which was the movie radar so the movie radar app so this one was another one which i really do enjoy and i really do love so let's go ahead and check out the so this is the app that i was talking about guys i forgot i wasn't showing my screen so we had the first app which was the clothing shopping so this is a top contender which has redux authentication a bunch of stuff and then we have the movie radar app which is insane as well i really do love this app and i think they've done an amazing job at taking pretty much what we taught maybe i'm not sure if you built this before you saw the netflix video but you took something which we had taught and you ran with it and you pretty much done really really well with that so amazing stuff right there awesome what i'm gonna do now is essentially go ahead and get the final so we have two contenders right here and the final one i think guys honestly it has to be the snap it up i mean this one just blew my mind when i saw it it was so nice so clean and i just it's such a functional use case like i think it's just such a good project like i really think it's a really good project like i know it's so simple but the thing is like every it really does get like a nice consistent sort of it's a very usable project right and i can see a lot of people are saying the live stream is lagging a little bit i'm sorry for that guys once it goes up it will be clearer and it should be the issue should be fixed okay and we shouldn't have this issue anymore um moving forward now so we have um let's go ahead and guys if it is lagging to you feel free to actually just rewind a little bit and then it can pretty much um if you want feel free to rewind a little bit and then you should actually avoid that buffer because you'll get by the time you get up to speed we would have crossed that issue with the connection okay so awesome so now what i'm going to go ahead and do is i'm going to close this one because that might be causing
