00:00 - my mac setup for coding and the setup
00:02 - that i actually recommend for you going
00:04 - into 2021
00:05 - smash that like button so this video
00:07 - goes out to more developers so
00:09 - they can also build an amazing career
00:11 - because this channel is
00:12 - all about helping you grow as a
00:15 - full-time or a freelance developer
00:17 - and breaking past that six-figure mark
00:20 - now
00:20 - there are a lot of tools that you're
00:22 - gonna learn about and there are a lot of
00:23 - new
00:24 - maybe things and workflows that you're
00:26 - gonna learn about that you might not
00:27 - have
00:28 - it's gonna take some time but pick them
00:29 - up they're gonna bring you so much value
00:31 - and increase your productivity as a
00:32 - developer it'll also allow you to
00:34 - build projects faster therefore have a
00:36 - better portfolio or
00:38 - perform higher at your job which allows
00:40 - you to actually make more
00:42 - income or if you're a freelancer make
00:44 - twice a amount of projects and make
00:45 - twice a amount of money
00:46 - let's jump right into it what's up guys
00:49 - this is quasi from cleverprogrammer.com
00:51 - i'm going to talk to you about how my
00:52 - mac
00:53 - is set up for coding i saw this cool
00:56 - article
00:57 - on daily.dev which is a great resource
00:59 - for you to go to and click their blog
01:01 - and it just gives you
01:02 - hot things that are happening and it
01:04 - made me think man my
01:05 - mac setup is pretty cool a lot of people
01:07 - ask me how do i have what i have
01:09 - and how do i use it so i'm gonna talk
01:11 - about it in this video i'm gonna just
01:12 - start riffing off pick up whatever you
01:14 - can i think it's gonna be really helpful
01:16 - so one of the things is for my command
01:18 - line i use zsh
01:20 - i highly highly highly recommend that
01:22 - you use this too
01:24 - for pretty much any language you're
01:25 - coding in csh gives you a really amazing
01:28 - environment
01:29 - to use it also get homebrew it allows
01:32 - you to install
01:33 - things very easily i think it will also
01:35 - be the thing that allows you to install
01:37 - csh
01:38 - homebrew for any of my web development i
01:40 - use
01:41 - chrome because it allows me to use the
01:43 - chrome inspector tool
01:44 - so i hope that you're using chrome as a
01:47 - developer
01:48 - and that's what i use for doing most of
01:50 - my web development
01:51 - highly recommend it because it has a
01:53 - great debugger built in
01:55 - it allows you to use the console and
01:56 - check what's going on
01:58 - and you know if you want to see how
02:01 - something looks
02:02 - in different mobile devices you can
02:03 - check that too so use chrome
02:05 - other things i use for my mac setup is i
02:08 - use
02:09 - alfred instead of spotlight alfred is
02:11 - just way better
02:12 - way faster learn how to use alfred i
02:15 - know we had a team member jacob on our
02:16 - team
02:17 - a clever programmer and he didn't know
02:19 - about alfred kept fighting with me he
02:21 - was like no this was not good he had
02:22 - this german accent we love this guy and
02:24 - then finally
02:25 - he gave up and he used alfred and he's
02:28 - like
02:29 - i am never going back alfred is the best
02:31 - and i was like
02:32 - i told you jacob i freaking told you so
02:34 - use
02:35 - alfred way faster than spotlight it will
02:37 - find your files really fast it's really
02:39 - helpful for programming as well
02:41 - for your terminal don't use the regular
02:43 - terminal i recommend
02:44 - use item 2. it comes in with a lot of
02:48 - smart things like auto suggestions it
02:50 - comes with the ability to
02:51 - search and find things built into it and
02:53 - a ton of other things which i can't even
02:55 - remember the top of my head
02:56 - but just use item 2 i just know that
02:59 - you're going to be a very happy
03:01 - developer
03:02 - i use git which obviously pretty much
03:04 - every developer uses
03:06 - and i have a workflow with git where i
03:08 - have a ssh built in
03:10 - which then allows me to essentially do
03:12 - my git
03:13 - commits without having to always ask for
03:15 - my email or password so it creates this
03:17 - nice workflow
03:18 - where i can do my git add git commit get
03:21 - push
03:21 - to origin master where i'm doing
03:23 - wherever i'm doing it without it needing
03:25 - me to
03:26 - constantly give it my password so learn
03:28 - how to use the ssh
03:30 - and learn how to make those keys and put
03:32 - them into your git
03:33 - and have that solid workflow for my ides
03:36 - when it comes to python a lot of the
03:38 - times i will go to pycharm
03:40 - and it's my main tool and weapon of
03:43 - choice and i just love it and i love how
03:45 - intelligent it
03:46 - is and whenever i can use pycharm i will
03:48 - always use pycharm
03:50 - my second option which is you know now
03:53 - becoming one of my favorite options also
03:56 - is
03:56 - visual studio code as my ide it's really
03:59 - really good
04:00 - i want to tell you what my work
04:01 - environment is
04:03 - so when i'm using visual studio code i
04:05 - like to use
04:06 - vim you know you can actually use it as
04:08 - an extension but
04:10 - vim is this whole other world that if
04:12 - you don't know about you're gonna fall
04:13 - into a rabbit hole
04:14 - it's the most beautiful thing on the
04:15 - planet most developers i try to convince
04:18 - nas half the time like hey learn them
04:19 - like yeah that's not gonna happen
04:21 - you know but that's whatever that's just
04:23 - nas i recommend
04:25 - and you you learn how to use vim it's
04:27 - freaking awesome
04:28 - if you don't get anything else out of it
04:30 - it's just an amazing rabbit hole to fall
04:32 - down into and it's just like
04:34 - what this is possible what is this world
04:37 - and why did nobody ever tell me about
04:40 - this it's just
04:40 - you just have these crazy brain
04:42 - explosion after brain explosion
04:44 - initially what will happen is your
04:45 - productivity will go down
04:47 - and you will feel that like that you are
04:50 - the worst developer on the planet
04:51 - you will become much worse much slower
04:53 - much more confused for about
04:55 - three weeks and on the fourth week you
04:57 - will
04:58 - get as good as you previously were so
05:00 - you'd be like that's not that cool
05:01 - but then week five six seven and eight
05:03 - two months three months in
05:05 - you're just gonna smoke your past self
05:07 - and then it's kind of beautiful the type
05:08 - of wizardry you can do
05:10 - and you truly just become a hacker and
05:12 - it's one of those people you know that
05:13 - we watch those hollywood movies and we
05:16 - go
05:16 - we want to be like that hacker guy you
05:18 - will become that hacker guy
05:20 - learn vim it actually helps speed up
05:22 - your productivity and development and
05:24 - all of that
05:25 - tons of other things i use on my visual
05:27 - studio code are
05:28 - prettier of course which is you know
05:30 - just making sure that
05:31 - when i'm saving stuff it just formats it
05:33 - really easily
05:34 - get lens to be able to do my git commits
05:37 - in just a much easier way it kind of
05:39 - this is super
05:40 - charges your code and your uh git
05:43 - environment which it does i recommend
05:45 - you use that plug-in
05:46 - bracket pair colorizer is another one
05:49 - that is very very helpful but just make
05:50 - sure your brackets are matching
05:52 - all the time live share is a extension i
05:54 - use
05:55 - with visual studio code to make sure
05:57 - that when i'm
05:58 - working with another developer we can
05:59 - work in the same environment and this is
06:01 - where i feel that visual studio code
06:03 - really takes the cake and this is one
06:04 - thing that's really awesome about
06:06 - them you can even share your local host
06:09 - terminal
06:09 - you can even share your actual local
06:12 - host
06:13 - that other developers working with you
06:14 - can actually see the app you're building
06:16 - you
06:17 - can see the errors in the command line
06:19 - can get full read and write
06:20 - functionality to your command line when
06:22 - you guys are writing code together
06:24 - there's zero lag and you can see each
06:25 - other's names and you guys are building
06:27 - it
06:27 - it's so freaking cool i love it live
06:30 - share extension on
06:31 - visual studio code and then other tools
06:33 - that i think that every day
06:35 - everybody in the modern world should
06:37 - just have are for example for
06:39 - communication
06:40 - slack is the best for developers you can
06:42 - write code in it you can write
06:44 - syntactically highlighted code in it
06:46 - which is just beautiful zoom to
06:49 - communicate with anybody online
06:50 - learn zoom annotations because it allows
06:53 - you to
06:53 - communicate your ideas really well so as
06:55 - a developer you could
06:57 - go into zoom and just circle you know a
06:59 - block of code or a function and just go
07:01 - this is the piece of code that i'm
07:02 - talking about
07:03 - and this piece of code does this other
07:05 - thing that i'm talking about
07:07 - that's really nice use the visual
07:10 - things because especially when you're
07:12 - explaining something to somebody who's
07:13 - not a developer
07:15 - who's a product manager or somebody else
07:18 - you want to be able to communicate your
07:20 - ideas with as less words and as many
07:22 - visuals as possible because it makes it
07:25 - so simple it takes all these complex
07:27 - ideas and turns them into something that
07:29 - is so
07:30 - extremely easy to understand other
07:32 - things i use with my mac setup
07:33 - is dropler incredibly easy for
07:36 - screenshots especially as a developer
07:38 - you want to screenshot highlight a
07:39 - certain portion of code
07:41 - hit the save url it immediately goes
07:43 - bloop
07:44 - and adds you know opens up a new tab
07:47 - it's already the image is uploaded
07:49 - online you can take that url and send it
07:51 - to somebody else
07:52 - if you want to record your screen and
07:54 - talk about it you could do it
07:55 - with dropler as well though for actually
07:57 - screen recording explaining your code
08:00 - and explaining what problems you have
08:02 - for example maybe you have
08:03 - you're a student who is stuck on a
08:06 - problem you're trying to explain
08:07 - what's wrong with you're trying to ask
08:09 - for help the best way is
08:10 - make a short video there's a service
08:13 - called loom
08:14 - you hit one button it just starts
08:16 - recording you and your screen
08:18 - so you can actually just highlight the
08:20 - part of code you're stuck on
08:21 - what your problem is and now whether
08:23 - you're a student or a professional
08:24 - software developer working at a company
08:26 - and as soon as you hit stop
08:28 - loom automatically uploads this video
08:29 - online in like five seconds
08:31 - you can take that url and send it to
08:33 - your co-worker or send it to your
08:35 - teacher
08:35 - or send it to your friend they will
08:37 - explain to you exactly
08:40 - when to see this video it's so easy for
08:42 - them to understand what your actual
08:43 - problem was
08:44 - they can then help you and then you know
08:46 - give you the right answer or help you
08:48 - move past your problem
08:50 - loom is extremely effective or if you're
08:52 - employed and you want to explain a
08:54 - concept
08:55 - using visuals and using a video
08:57 - extremely extremely important
08:59 - so use that tool the other things that i
09:02 - like to just recommend especially if
09:04 - you're using a mac is learn what virtual
09:06 - desktops are
09:07 - make sure that you have more than one
09:09 - virtual desktop opened up
09:10 - at any given time so you can have
09:12 - cleaner environments and move around
09:14 - faster i have a tool called spectacle
09:16 - which allows me to do
09:17 - window management so if i'm trying to
09:19 - open up a terminal and put it on one
09:21 - side or i'm trying to open up another
09:22 - thing put it on the other side
09:23 - spectacle is a great tool that allows me
09:26 - to do window management you can also use
09:28 - a app called magnet other than that i'm
09:31 - gonna keep going forever so i'm just
09:32 - gonna stop i hope that this video was
09:34 - valuable for you if it was make sure
09:36 - just drop in the comment let me know
09:38 - what was your number one biggest
09:39 - takeaway or if you found it valuable and
09:41 - if you did
09:42 - what was something that you found
09:43 - valuable what did you take out of it
09:45 - what are you going to be using what does

Cleaned transcript:

my mac setup for coding and the setup that i actually recommend for you going into 2021 smash that like button so this video goes out to more developers so they can also build an amazing career because this channel is all about helping you grow as a fulltime or a freelance developer and breaking past that sixfigure mark now there are a lot of tools that you're gonna learn about and there are a lot of new maybe things and workflows that you're gonna learn about that you might not have it's gonna take some time but pick them up they're gonna bring you so much value and increase your productivity as a developer it'll also allow you to build projects faster therefore have a better portfolio or perform higher at your job which allows you to actually make more income or if you're a freelancer make twice a amount of projects and make twice a amount of money let's jump right into it what's up guys this is quasi from cleverprogrammer.com i'm going to talk to you about how my mac is set up for coding i saw this cool article on daily.dev which is a great resource for you to go to and click their blog and it just gives you hot things that are happening and it made me think man my mac setup is pretty cool a lot of people ask me how do i have what i have and how do i use it so i'm gonna talk about it in this video i'm gonna just start riffing off pick up whatever you can i think it's gonna be really helpful so one of the things is for my command line i use zsh i highly highly highly recommend that you use this too for pretty much any language you're coding in csh gives you a really amazing environment to use it also get homebrew it allows you to install things very easily i think it will also be the thing that allows you to install csh homebrew for any of my web development i use chrome because it allows me to use the chrome inspector tool so i hope that you're using chrome as a developer and that's what i use for doing most of my web development highly recommend it because it has a great debugger built in it allows you to use the console and check what's going on and you know if you want to see how something looks in different mobile devices you can check that too so use chrome other things i use for my mac setup is i use alfred instead of spotlight alfred is just way better way faster learn how to use alfred i know we had a team member jacob on our team a clever programmer and he didn't know about alfred kept fighting with me he was like no this was not good he had this german accent we love this guy and then finally he gave up and he used alfred and he's like i am never going back alfred is the best and i was like i told you jacob i freaking told you so use alfred way faster than spotlight it will find your files really fast it's really helpful for programming as well for your terminal don't use the regular terminal i recommend use item 2. it comes in with a lot of smart things like auto suggestions it comes with the ability
