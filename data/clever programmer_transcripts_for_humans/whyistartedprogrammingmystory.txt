With timestamps:

00:00 - - There's something in
APIs called throttling.
00:02 - Okay, I didn't know this at that time.
00:04 - And if you go over the
number of requests per second
00:07 - for an API, you will throttle it.
00:10 - So for example,
00:11 - if you're using the Twilio
API to send texts to people,
00:15 - and you start sending like
millions of texts per second
00:18 - they're probably gonna throttle you.
00:19 - Okay, their limit might be
00:21 - you can only send 100 texts per second
00:22 - or 10 texts per second.
00:24 - Otherwise you'll get throttled.
00:25 - So I was getting throttled.
00:26 - I had no idea why.
00:27 - I don't know what the fuck was going on.
00:30 - But just massively confused.
00:31 - And I remember, I'm like, I
don't know what's going on.
00:34 - But I bet there is somebody
on this planet that does.
00:38 - I started Googling my way around.
00:41 - I went to this platform called Wyzant,
00:43 - where people teach other people.
00:46 - So there are people who
can teach you coding.
00:48 - There are people who
can teach you swimming.
00:50 - Whatever it may be.
00:51 - So I went on that platform.
00:52 - I found my first coding mentor.
00:55 - His name is Gene Bjor.
00:59 - It's a French name, okay.
01:00 - I still have him on my
Facebook actually, as a friend.
01:03 - And that was the guy that like,
01:05 - pretty much changed my whole life
01:06 - and introduced me to programming.
01:08 - So, at this point,
01:09 - I didn't know I had maxed
out my spreadsheet, okay,
01:12 - with so many complex formulas.
01:14 - And I didn't know how else to improve it.
01:16 - But I knew that there had to
be some way of improving it.
01:20 - And I just had a hunch that it
might be called Programming.
01:23 - Like a programmer might know what to do.
01:25 - But I didn't know for sure.
01:26 - So I went to this guy,
01:27 - he whipped up the solution so fast.
01:30 - I was paying him I think $60 an hour.
01:33 - And I was a little bit worried.
01:34 - I'm like, how many hours is he gonna take?
01:35 - How's he gonna work?
01:36 - He whipped out the solution so fast,
01:38 - he turned into like a CSV file.
01:40 - He knew how to read data,
he knew how to write data.
01:42 - He knew how to work with API.
01:44 - He knew how all this shit worked together,
01:46 - and then ultimately he
outputted the data to a file.
01:49 - I remember, he did that
thing in like 10 minutes.
01:53 - And my mind was just blown.
01:55 - I'm like, here is a thing
01:58 - that could literally grow my business.
02:00 - That could literally double or
triple my freaking business.
02:03 - And I didn't know how to do it.
02:05 - And this guy just did
it in like 10 minutes.
02:07 - I would have to do insane
amount of manual work.
02:10 - I had a crazy, complex workflow.
02:14 - Like when I was young, when I was 18,
02:15 - I had this crazy shit
with my chess business
02:18 - where on the Excel spreadsheet,
02:19 - I would have it so once I have
found out all the libraries
02:22 - and their phone numbers, I
would give access to people,
02:25 - and I would say each, for
every call somebody makes,
02:29 - it would give them one extra dollar.
02:32 - So it had this automated setup where
02:33 - if you were working for
me every call you made
02:36 - I sent you a dollar for that call.
02:38 - And if you close the client,
02:39 - I would send you like $100 for that.
02:42 - And I had my friends working
for me making these calls.
02:45 - And it had a way to log this information,
02:48 - it had a way to actually
verify everything.
02:50 - And I was doing all of
this in Excel spreadsheet.
02:53 - But I had maxed it out to the point where
02:55 - I couldn't do anything with it anymore.
02:57 - And then I thought, okay,
I need to do something.
02:59 - That's when I went to the developer.
03:01 - The developer guy figured this shit out.
03:02 - Made it seem like child's play.
03:05 - And that's when I thought,
03:06 - I'm like, you know what?
03:08 - There might be something
to this coding thing.
03:11 - There might be something
to this programming thing.
03:14 - And then I started going,
03:16 - and everything, every complex shit
03:19 - that I had written in
my Excel spreadsheet,
03:22 - I started coding it up.
03:25 - You know, I had really crazy things.
03:27 - Like I had this Zapier integration
with my Excel spreadsheet
03:30 - that would log the amount
of hours I had sex for,
03:33 - because I would go in this one location,
03:35 - this one shady parking
lot with my ex-girlfriend
03:38 - and it would automatically time-stamp it.
03:41 - So it would use the Google API to know
03:44 - that we were in that location.
03:45 - It would log that in
the Excel spreadsheet.
03:48 - And then when we left that place,
03:51 - it would hit the Google API,
03:53 - log the end time and then I
had a formula that calculated,
03:58 - you know, the time
difference between the two.
04:00 - And then it would ultimately start
04:02 - keep track of that session.
04:04 - I still have that information to this day.
04:07 - And I should maybe send it to my ex.
04:08 - That would be really funny.
04:09 - But I won't.
04:10 - And so, that was what
it was helping me do.
04:13 - And I was using it, I was
using coding for everything.
04:15 - So when I tell you guys use
coding for things that help you,
04:19 - that's one of the things
that I used it for.
04:21 - Other practical things I
use it for were this, okay?
04:24 - Let's say I had a client
that paid me $35 an hour.
04:28 - Cool.
04:29 - So I thought, okay, this
guy's paying me $35.
04:31 - Again this was back when
I was in high school.
04:32 - I just started college at
18, and I'm like, okay.
04:35 - This person is paying me,
04:36 - he pays me $35 an hour.
04:38 - I know multiple of my
clients pay me $35 an hour.
04:40 - But I have to go and manually type
04:42 - all this shit in after I'm done.
04:43 - How can I automate this process?
04:45 - So I thought, okay, again why
don't I use the Google API
04:49 - and log it so when I
enter this person's home,
04:53 - it logs as I enter.
04:55 - When I leave this person's home,
04:56 - it logs when I exited.
04:58 - And if it was two hours long,
05:01 - it would say that I
generated 35 times two,
05:04 - $70 for two hours.
05:06 - So it would do the math for me.
05:08 - It would use the maps for me.
05:11 - And it would figure it out.
05:12 - So I was using it for my invoicing.
05:14 - I was using a lot of
automation and programming,
05:17 - and Excel spreadsheets for my life.
05:19 - But again, this was
still Excel spreadsheets.
05:21 - So one I discovered programming, I'm like,
05:23 - I'm going to be unstoppable,
and it was like that.
05:25 - And then I immediately went
back to all those excel files.
05:28 - Turned them into these python programs,
05:30 - that blew my mind, took my
chess business to the next level
05:34 - 'cause now I could actually
do this shit on my own.
05:38 - That was exciting.
05:39 - And more than that,
05:41 - it showed me the
possibilities are endless.
05:44 - Anything I can dream up
in this crazy wild brain
05:48 - God has given me, as long as
I can think it, I can have it.
05:53 - I can make it, I can
put it into existence.
05:58 - And that's really the thing that I find
06:01 - so very, very, very fascinating
06:04 - when it comes to coding, programming.
06:06 - That's why I'm such a fan.
06:07 - And that's really one of the
ways I actually got into this
06:12 - whole world of coding.
06:14 - That's how it started for me.
06:17 - That's what sparked
06:18 - that initial interest
that got me into this.
06:21 - And then from there, I
was off to the races.
06:23 - Once I discovered this thing,
I took off 'cause I loved it.
06:27 - I was passionate about it
06:28 - and I would do it for 10, 15 hours a day.
06:32 - That's pretty much my story for coding.
06:35 - Let me know what got you started.
06:37 - So let me know what got you excited.
06:39 - Let me know what got you
interested in programming.
06:42 - Drop it in the comments below.
06:43 - I wanna see what got everybody excited.
06:46 - If you like this video, let me know.
06:47 - Hit the like button.
06:48 - Thank you so much for watching.
06:49 - As always, I love your beautiful face.
