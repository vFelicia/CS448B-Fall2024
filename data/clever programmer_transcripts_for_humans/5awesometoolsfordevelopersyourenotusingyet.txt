01:16 - build
01:17 - uh only five awesome tools for
01:20 - developers
01:21 - which can help you become a better
01:25 - and a more efficient developer
01:28 - right so with that done
01:31 - let's jump straight into it awesome i
01:34 - see portugal
01:35 - france and bangladesh in the house
01:39 - nice guys everybody just drop in where
01:41 - you are calling him from
01:43 - okay uh let's actually get started with
01:46 - the first one
01:47 - i really hope i don't have to uh
01:50 - introduce you this guy
01:52 - uh this is we as code um
01:55 - probably you already know this one but
01:57 - we are here for
01:58 - uh tools that will help you so i'm going
02:01 - to show you a couple of
02:03 - awesome extensions you might need need
02:06 - to
02:07 - download and i will move my face a bit
02:10 - a little so that you can see it better
02:13 - so the first one is
02:17 - it's called es7 react redux
02:21 - graphql and react native snippets so
02:24 - this
02:24 - is a productivity tool
02:28 - uh which can give you the ability
02:31 - to create react redux graphql and
02:34 - react native snippets in just a uh
02:38 - with just a couple uh of bottom
02:40 - pressings
02:41 - so let's actually test it out how it uh
02:44 - looks
02:45 - so i've set up a vs code a test test.js
02:49 - file
02:50 - nothing fancy here uh i'm just going to
02:52 - show you
02:53 - how to get this thing uh going so
02:57 - uh inside of extensions you can just go
02:59 - ahead and type in es7 and the first one
03:03 - will be the uh the extension that you
03:06 - want to download
03:07 - under here you can already see that
03:10 - there are
03:10 - several um
03:14 - snippets that you can just go ahead and
03:16 - type in and
03:17 - will help you so for example if you uh
03:20 - want to
03:20 - import something uh you can go ahead and
03:23 - type in imn
03:24 - and you can just go ahead and import it
03:28 - all right let's actually see how it
03:30 - works in action
03:31 - so i can go ahead and type in rafce
03:35 - which will pop a an arrow function
03:39 - react uh component to my screen
03:42 - with a with an exporting uh feature
03:45 - right
03:47 - so but if i go ahead and type
03:52 - rfc that will give you
03:56 - a different kind of react function but
03:59 - notice that uh i could actually say that
04:02 - react uh ra
04:06 - so react arrow function component export
04:09 - you can literally
04:10 - say the words that are
04:14 - with uh that is that the abbreviation
04:17 - stands for and you will know what
04:20 - will be appearing on your screen right
04:23 - so super easy
04:24 - and super awesome tool to use
04:28 - and you can see that this is an arrow
04:30 - function
04:31 - so it gives you so much more
04:35 - productivity okay let's actually
04:39 - leave this and and go back and check out
04:42 - our next um extension
04:45 - okay next up live share you probably
04:49 - have seen
04:49 - a lot of times that uh when we are
04:52 - building something
04:53 - uh with sunny we are using something
04:56 - called the live share
04:58 - so liveshare literally gives me the
05:00 - ability
05:01 - to uh use sony's
05:05 - macbook and and write code on that one
05:08 - using mine right so i can
05:12 - go ahead and with this
05:15 - little button i can start a
05:17 - collaboration session
05:18 - and after signing in with either
05:21 - microsoft or
05:22 - github i can just share a link
05:26 - and i can go ahead and collaborate with
05:28 - anybody
05:29 - this is a super um good
05:32 - extension to use because you can go
05:35 - ahead and um
05:38 - you can go ahead and do pair programming
05:41 - right
05:42 - and pair programming is the most um
05:46 - the most advanced thing to do if you
05:49 - want to learn
05:50 - programming fast right all right
05:54 - let's actually see our next extension
05:57 - next one is going to be uh bracket pair
06:00 - colorizer
06:02 - looks like this uh you cannot miss it
06:05 - out
06:05 - actually and this is more like
06:09 - for um more like to help you
06:13 - when when you're debugging so if i go
06:15 - ahead and
06:16 - let's say i delete this uh bracket
06:19 - over uh this closing bracket over there
06:23 - uh and i can just do it like this it
06:26 - already starts freaking out
06:27 - uh down here
06:31 - uh i already see that there is one
06:33 - problem and
06:34 - it says right there that there is a
06:37 - curly brace
06:38 - which is missing right
06:41 - so normally i
06:44 - all these brackets would look like the
06:46 - same the color would be
06:48 - the exact same and i can just go ahead
06:51 - and start debugging by
06:53 - okay i know uh this is these two uh are
06:56 - yellow
06:56 - i have those uh this yellow i don't see
06:59 - the pair so i can just
07:00 - chuck it right in and the problem is
07:03 - already solved now this was a super easy
07:05 - example but if you're going with a
07:11 - big um with bigger project
07:14 - this will help you a lot trust me just
07:16 - go ahead
07:17 - uh type in bracket
07:20 - pair colorizer and
07:23 - this is the one that you want to
07:25 - download it will make your life
07:27 - so much more easier especially when
07:30 - you're debugging right
07:33 - all right um let's go and see
07:36 - what do we have what what's the next one
07:39 - this will be live server now live server
07:42 - is
07:44 - actually this button i hope you can see
07:47 - it down there
07:47 - nope because my head because my face is
07:50 - right there i will
07:52 - move it away so
07:56 - that little button that go live button
08:00 - and that will allow you um
08:04 - to do hot reloading when you're
08:07 - uh coding with a normal
08:10 - html file right so it's uh
08:14 - so normally with the html css and
08:16 - javascript file setup
08:18 - you don't have the hot reloading feature
08:20 - which actually react has
08:22 - but you can add this feature
08:27 - to your project with that little um
08:31 - extension okay
08:36 - okay i think my i think
08:40 - uh we have just dropped off okay uh
08:43 - we are back i see a lot of people are
08:46 - already watching it nice okay uh
08:49 - sorry for the uh connection issue
08:52 - we will wait a little bit for everybody
08:55 - to join
08:56 - back here um i'm sorry for
08:59 - the inconvenience so
09:02 - um there's another app for windows
09:06 - like screen brush yes there is uh you
09:09 - can just go ahead and
09:10 - uh and type in
09:14 - you can just go ahead and search up uh
09:16 - screen brush equivalent
09:18 - on the windows and it will literally
09:20 - give you
09:21 - a lot of uh a
09:24 - lot of options to choose from okay
09:31 - yes i will be sharing the terminal
09:33 - extension i am using
09:35 - it's a great question we will be talking
09:38 - about that because terminal
09:39 - is a very important tool okay
09:43 - let's jump back to our uh presentation
09:46 - so we were talking about
09:48 - uh git lens right so it's gets uh
09:51 - supercharged this is the one you want to
09:54 - download
09:55 - uh this gives you this ability in here
09:58 - uh in vs code it actually shows me that
10:02 - i've made
10:03 - some changes uh over there
10:06 - in tesla js file i can literally go
10:09 - ahead and compare
10:10 - it uh to other
10:14 - commits that i would have already made
10:18 - i actually can go ahead and show you how
10:20 - it looks like so i can
10:22 - type git add dot and
10:26 - and change something here maybe
10:31 - actually not like this i can add the
10:34 - span
10:35 - in here and
10:38 - this should uh update very quickly and
10:41 - very very soon so i will be able to show
10:44 - you
10:48 - and yeah there we go so it actually
10:51 - shows that
10:52 - since so my first commit which is
10:54 - basically initializing my file
10:57 - there was nothing but then this thing
11:00 - happened and i added this thing now i
11:02 - can go ahead
11:03 - and do another commit
11:06 - so get a dot and
11:10 - i think it should be showing now okay
11:13 - for some reason
11:14 - it's freaking out um
11:17 - let's actually go for our next uh
11:22 - next extension that i want to show you
11:25 - and i think this is going to be the last
11:27 - one yes
11:28 - uh so auto whoops uh
11:32 - wrong annotation tool auto close tag
11:35 - auto close tag will help you with html
11:38 - attacks and
11:38 - xml attacks right so you don't
11:42 - have to worry about all the headache uh
11:45 - of typing in the closing tag as well as
11:48 - the opening tag
11:49 - so i can uh zoom in a little so i can so
11:53 - as you can see there is a span tag in
11:56 - there and
11:57 - i don't know i could just type in hello
12:00 - clever programmers nice
12:04 - and if i want to go ahead and change up
12:07 - the html tag around it
12:11 - i can do it super easily so notice that
12:15 - uh even my other the closing tag
12:18 - is changing with the opening tag right
12:21 - let's actually see it again i will be
12:24 - underlining it uh
12:27 - so that you can see it better uh no it's
12:30 - moving away
12:31 - but i could like type strong in here
12:35 - not string and
12:38 - and it still changes and it also gives
12:41 - you the ability
12:43 - to just type in one uh tag and it will
12:46 - literally
12:46 - go ahead and close it for you super
12:50 - awesome uh
12:51 - tool to use and i could just recommend
12:54 - downloading it
12:55 - okay that's all for uh vs code
12:59 - uh extensions let's go for other uh
13:02 - not that much development related
13:04 - however
13:07 - very useful and very useful tools for
13:11 - you
13:12 - next up is figma figma is a
13:15 - completely free design tool
13:18 - that we uh clever programmer use and we
13:21 - teach how to use it
13:24 - you can go ahead and register on
13:27 - figma.com
13:28 - if you don't want to go if you don't
13:30 - want to download the application however
13:32 - it actually has an application and i can
13:35 - just go ahead and literally
13:37 - uh change like uh change the
13:40 - text up here epic store locator
13:44 - and that will give me the ability to see
13:47 - my whole
13:48 - web app or in one piece
13:51 - uh it also gives you the ability
13:55 - uh to modify and and literally like
14:00 - add so much stuff and and just design
14:02 - the whole web page
14:03 - as you please and you can also go ahead
14:06 - and copy and paste these uh
14:09 - details into your css file all right
14:12 - um let's
14:16 - go ahead and let's see what our next
14:19 - tool is oh my zsh
14:22 - now you could ask what is this but i
14:26 - actually remember there was
14:27 - a comment before asking what is the
14:31 - terminal extension
14:32 - or the terminal tool that i'm using so
14:35 - i'm rocking
14:36 - with the basic prebuilt
14:39 - terminal of my macbook but i am using
14:43 - all my zsh and you can go ahead and
14:45 - download it from the ohmyz
14:48 - dot sh uh website
14:51 - with a single croco and
14:54 - notice that uh it has plugins
14:58 - for node.js uh even spotify uses it
15:01 - uh and and and it's very widely used
15:04 - uh it has a large community behind it
15:08 - um and it actually gives you the ability
15:12 - to
15:13 - see everything at a glance so i'm in my
15:16 - whatsapp backend project
15:18 - i can see that there is a get version
15:21 - control
15:22 - initialized and i am currently on the
15:24 - master branch right
15:27 - and it also shows you that app.js is an
15:30 - actual file
15:32 - however this is a folder as well as
15:35 - node modules right so
15:38 - these are actually just a couple of
15:40 - things plus it actually looks cool
15:42 - and if you're uh coding in a cafe
15:44 - everyone will be like
15:45 - whoa that's such and such an awesome
15:47 - tool everyone will be like oh
15:49 - are you a hacker or something so
15:53 - you can literally go ahead and use it um
15:56 - it will make using terminal so much
15:59 - easier
16:00 - so i can just highly recommend going
16:02 - ahead and downloading it and later on
16:04 - you can deep dive into how to use it
16:07 - all right next up guys who knows
16:10 - what is this drop it in the comments who
16:13 - knows what
16:14 - what's what what can be seen on the
16:16 - screen right
16:18 - drop it in the comments um
16:21 - we actually used it uh in a couple of
16:24 - our
16:24 - builds on here in youtube
16:28 - uh i just want yeah material ui
16:31 - that is right so we are
16:34 - oh yeah this is not the one i wanted to
16:36 - highlight uh
16:38 - yeah material ui uh great answer
16:42 - that's the one uh over here
16:45 - makes frontend and full stack
16:47 - development
16:48 - so much easier by literally giving you
16:52 - full react components uh
16:56 - and you can just go ahead and worst-case
16:58 - scenario uh you can just
17:00 - put them into a different component
17:04 - and then import it uh into your project
17:06 - if you don't
17:07 - don't uh if you're not able to make it
17:09 - work because
17:10 - these um these codes
17:14 - are written in react js and
17:17 - you can actually go ahead and try out
17:20 - these uh buttons and gives you
17:24 - everything that you will need throughout
17:26 - your development
17:29 - okay um let's go back and the last
17:33 - two that i highly recommend you
17:37 - using what do you think that is this is
17:39 - you can go ahead
17:40 - drop it in the comment section this is
17:42 - more like a project management tool
17:45 - i help you with that much but just go
17:47 - ahead
17:48 - drop it in the comments if you know what
17:50 - this tool is
17:52 - so this is actually it no it's not
17:56 - resolved
17:57 - um okay we're back live i think
18:01 - once again yeah okay uh i had another
18:05 - uh connection issue okay so this is
18:08 - asana
18:09 - this is one of the most advanced
18:12 - um
18:16 - project management tool ever and you can
18:19 - act
18:19 - when you are working with a client you
18:21 - can go ahead
18:22 - and uh invite them into the
18:26 - workspace that you're in so i could just
18:28 - go ahead and
18:30 - uh i don't know uh ask qazi
18:33 - uh if qazi was my client i could
18:35 - literally
18:36 - invite him into this project and he
18:39 - would be
18:39 - able to see how am i doing with
18:43 - my project so i could literally add um
18:46 - subtasks and all those kind of stuff
18:50 - and it actually and i could do this
18:54 - it moves everything nice and smoothly
18:57 - you can add deadlines you can add
18:59 - literally go ahead and add priority
19:02 - i personally am using asana with
19:05 - my uh clients

Cleaned transcript:

tools for developers that will advance you in your programming uh and freelance web developer carrier and will help you become so much more productive by using these tools so let's actually jump straight into uh today's presentation uh this is going to be a quick presentation on these five tools for those of you who are just joining we will be talking about five awesome tools uh for developers you are probably not using yet and actually what to get right now as you are watching this video to boost you in web development and make you so much more uh productive when you're working with clients and these are actually from experience uh mine and the team's experience so we uh we we really want just one to help you uh with these tools okay with that done um actually let's everybody drop in the comment section where you're coming in from and if you're excited about today's build uh only five awesome tools for developers which can help you become a better and a more efficient developer right so with that done let's jump straight into it awesome i see portugal france and bangladesh in the house nice guys everybody just drop in where you are calling him from okay uh let's actually get started with the first one i really hope i don't have to uh introduce you this guy uh this is we as code um probably you already know this one but we are here for uh tools that will help you so i'm going to show you a couple of awesome extensions you might need need to download and i will move my face a bit a little so that you can see it better so the first one is it's called es7 react redux graphql and react native snippets so this is a productivity tool uh which can give you the ability to create react redux graphql and react native snippets in just a uh with just a couple uh of bottom pressings so let's actually test it out how it uh looks so i've set up a vs code a test test.js file nothing fancy here uh i'm just going to show you how to get this thing uh going so uh inside of extensions you can just go ahead and type in es7 and the first one will be the uh the extension that you want to download under here you can already see that there are several um snippets that you can just go ahead and type in and will help you so for example if you uh want to import something uh you can go ahead and type in imn and you can just go ahead and import it all right let's actually see how it works in action so i can go ahead and type in rafce which will pop a an arrow function react uh component to my screen with a with an exporting uh feature right so but if i go ahead and type rfc that will give you a different kind of react function but notice that uh i could actually say that react uh ra so react arrow function component export you can literally say the words that are with uh that is that the abbreviation stands for and you will know what will be appearing on your screen right so super easy and super awesome tool to use and you can see that this is an arrow function so it gives you so much more productivity okay let's actually leave this and and go back and check out our next um extension okay next up live share you probably have seen a lot of times that uh when we are building something uh with sunny we are using something called the live share so liveshare literally gives me the ability to uh use sony's macbook and and write code on that one using mine right so i can go ahead and with this little button i can start a collaboration session and after signing in with either microsoft or github i can just share a link and i can go ahead and collaborate with anybody this is a super um good extension to use because you can go ahead and um you can go ahead and do pair programming right and pair programming is the most um the most advanced thing to do if you want to learn programming fast right all right let's actually see our next extension next one is going to be uh bracket pair colorizer looks like this uh you cannot miss it out actually and this is more like for um more like to help you when when you're debugging so if i go ahead and let's say i delete this uh bracket over uh this closing bracket over there uh and i can just do it like this it already starts freaking out uh down here uh i already see that there is one problem and it says right there that there is a curly brace which is missing right so normally i all these brackets would look like the same the color would be the exact same and i can just go ahead and start debugging by okay i know uh this is these two uh are yellow i have those uh this yellow i don't see the pair so i can just chuck it right in and the problem is already solved now this was a super easy example but if you're going with a big um with bigger project this will help you a lot trust me just go ahead uh type in bracket pair colorizer and this is the one that you want to download it will make your life so much more easier especially when you're debugging right all right um let's go and see what do we have what what's the next one this will be live server now live server is actually this button i hope you can see it down there nope because my head because my face is right there i will move it away so that little button that go live button and that will allow you um to do hot reloading when you're uh coding with a normal html file right so it's uh so normally with the html css and javascript file setup you don't have the hot reloading feature which actually react has but you can add this feature to your project with that little um extension okay okay i think my i think uh we have just dropped off okay uh we are back i see a lot of people are already watching it nice okay uh sorry for the uh connection issue we will wait a little bit for everybody to join back here um i'm sorry for the inconvenience so um there's another app for windows like screen brush yes there is uh you can just go ahead and uh and type in you can just go ahead and search up uh screen brush equivalent on the windows and it will literally give you a lot of uh a lot of options to choose from okay yes i will be sharing the terminal extension i am using it's a great question we will be talking about that because terminal is a very important tool okay let's jump back to our uh presentation so we were talking about uh git lens right so it's gets uh supercharged this is the one you want to download uh this gives you this ability in here uh in vs code it actually shows me that i've made some changes uh over there in tesla js file i can literally go ahead and compare it uh to other commits that i would have already made i actually can go ahead and show you how it looks like so i can type git add dot and and change something here maybe actually not like this i can add the span in here and this should uh update very quickly and very very soon so i will be able to show you and yeah there we go so it actually shows that since so my first commit which is basically initializing my file there was nothing but then this thing happened and i added this thing now i can go ahead and do another commit so get a dot and i think it should be showing now okay for some reason it's freaking out um let's actually go for our next uh next extension that i want to show you and i think this is going to be the last one yes uh so auto whoops uh wrong annotation tool auto close tag auto close tag will help you with html attacks and xml attacks right so you don't have to worry about all the headache uh of typing in the closing tag as well as the opening tag so i can uh zoom in a little so i can so as you can see there is a span tag in there and i don't know i could just type in hello clever programmers nice and if i want to go ahead and change up the html tag around it i can do it super easily so notice that uh even my other the closing tag is changing with the opening tag right let's actually see it again i will be underlining it uh so that you can see it better uh no it's moving away but i could like type strong in here not string and and it still changes and it also gives you the ability to just type in one uh tag and it will literally go ahead and close it for you super awesome uh tool to use and i could just recommend downloading it okay that's all for uh vs code uh extensions let's go for other uh not that much development related however very useful and very useful tools for you next up is figma figma is a completely free design tool that we uh clever programmer use and we teach how to use it you can go ahead and register on figma.com if you don't want to go if you don't want to download the application however it actually has an application and i can just go ahead and literally uh change like uh change the text up here epic store locator and that will give me the ability to see my whole web app or in one piece uh it also gives you the ability uh to modify and and literally like add so much stuff and and just design the whole web page as you please and you can also go ahead and copy and paste these uh details into your css file all right um let's go ahead and let's see what our next tool is oh my zsh now you could ask what is this but i actually remember there was a comment before asking what is the terminal extension or the terminal tool that i'm using so i'm rocking with the basic prebuilt terminal of my macbook but i am using all my zsh and you can go ahead and download it from the ohmyz dot sh uh website with a single croco and notice that uh it has plugins for node.js uh even spotify uses it uh and and and it's very widely used uh it has a large community behind it um and it actually gives you the ability to see everything at a glance so i'm in my whatsapp backend project i can see that there is a get version control initialized and i am currently on the master branch right and it also shows you that app.js is an actual file however this is a folder as well as node modules right so these are actually just a couple of things plus it actually looks cool and if you're uh coding in a cafe everyone will be like whoa that's such and such an awesome tool everyone will be like oh are you a hacker or something so you can literally go ahead and use it um it will make using terminal so much easier so i can just highly recommend going ahead and downloading it and later on you can deep dive into how to use it all right next up guys who knows what is this drop it in the comments who knows what what's what what can be seen on the screen right drop it in the comments um we actually used it uh in a couple of our builds on here in youtube uh i just want yeah material ui that is right so we are oh yeah this is not the one i wanted to highlight uh yeah material ui uh great answer that's the one uh over here makes frontend and full stack development so much easier by literally giving you full react components uh and you can just go ahead and worstcase scenario uh you can just put them into a different component and then import it uh into your project if you don't don't uh if you're not able to make it work because these um these codes are written in react js and you can actually go ahead and try out these uh buttons and gives you everything that you will need throughout your development okay um let's go back and the last two that i highly recommend you using what do you think that is this is you can go ahead drop it in the comment section this is more like a project management tool i help you with that much but just go ahead drop it in the comments if you know what this tool is so this is actually it no it's not resolved um okay we're back live i think once again yeah okay uh i had another uh connection issue okay so this is asana this is one of the most advanced um project management tool ever and you can act when you are working with a client you can go ahead and uh invite them into the workspace that you're in so i could just go ahead and uh i don't know uh ask qazi uh if qazi was my client i could literally invite him into this project and he would be able to see how am i doing with my project so i could literally add um subtasks and all those kind of stuff and it actually and i could do this it moves everything nice and smoothly you can add deadlines you can add literally go ahead and add priority i personally am using asana with my uh clients and we actually do use it inside of team cp and yes asana is free however there is uh there are paid options for asana but the free version will be completely enough for you when you're working with clients right okay yes it is like trello um and yeah let's actually carry on and wow guys if you actually um found this video valuable uh let's go ahead and smash the like button like literally go ahead and and press it and like destroy it so we can get this video out to everybody and we can help 5 000 people to get a job as a developer in uh 2020 right let's show that 2020 is actually a good year okay let's carry on with the with asana so when you are working with a client the client prop oh and thank you very much aj for the huge donation uh massive thank you so you're saying from past 10 days i have been watching your videos and i love the energy capable going there thank you so much brother uh i appreciate that you're here and you're with us and watching these lives okay let's go and carry

summary that i don't know like front end is complete now this is a uh not the best example but you get you get my point uh it says everything is on track uh it even shows it right there whenever you're viewing the list or board or if you're paying you can go ahead and view the timeline or i think the column yeah the calendar view is actually free okay that was all about asana and that actually concluded all the five tools that you should be using to increase your productivity efficiency as a developer when you are working with clients or without clients because efficiency will always be the number one goal because the more efficient you are the better you can get and the more money you can make right simple as that and the bonus is profit with javascript this is currently
