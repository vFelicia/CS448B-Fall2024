00:00 - so i was on a vacation with my
00:01 - girlfriend and i thought
00:03 - hey what if i started learning react
00:05 - native and then i thought
00:06 - even better what if i actually
00:08 - documented the process of me
00:10 - learning it hopefully it'll give you
00:11 - some value and it'll probably just be
00:14 - really entertaining
00:15 - so you might be sitting there going why
00:17 - cosby
00:18 - why are you learning to react native
00:21 - what are you gonna get out of it
00:23 - that's a great question let me answer i
00:25 - was thinking that to myself too why am i
00:27 - actually gonna learn this
00:28 - so i can actually build courses for
00:31 - you right here on youtube so if you're
00:34 - liking this so far
00:35 - smash the like button subscribe to the
00:36 - channel and this is the channel where
00:38 - you learn all things react
00:40 - react native and full stack development
00:42 - and now
00:43 - let's get into what i've learned so far
00:47 - in one day of learning i've learned how
00:49 - to install react native through the expo
00:52 - cli
00:53 - i've learned how to actually initialize
00:54 - a project with react native on my
00:57 - computer
00:58 - i've learned how to run an ios simulator
01:01 - on my computer which is super cool and
01:03 - i've also learned
01:04 - how to with my app being in development
01:08 - mode
01:08 - using a lan connection have the app on
01:11 - my phone
01:14 - now there are a couple of other
01:16 - interesting things that i discovered
01:17 - about react native which are like
01:19 - in react you're actually making regular
01:22 - components you're writing html
01:24 - in react native you don't do that and
01:27 - wherever you have to write text
01:29 - here you actually would write the text
01:31 - component
01:32 - and what react native does is
01:34 - essentially turns
01:35 - everything that you're writing into the
01:38 - native
01:39 - platform so basically you just write
01:41 - javascript once
01:42 - and it's native code on every mobile app
01:45 - everywhere
01:45 - you can install react native like
01:48 - completely
01:49 - blank when you install when you do
01:51 - exponent
01:52 - your project name or you could actually
01:55 - start it off with
01:57 - tabs built with typescript i recommend
02:00 - that you actually start it off with the
02:02 - typescript version
02:03 - with the tabs already built because when
02:06 - you do that
02:07 - straight off the bat you already have
02:09 - navigation working you have some hooks
02:10 - working
02:11 - you have uh you have a bottom navigation
02:14 - there you can actually route
02:16 - between two pages it's quite cool
02:19 - and so as a developer it takes away a
02:22 - ton
02:22 - of boilerplate code that you would
02:24 - normally do the other thing is state
02:26 - management and while in react native
02:28 - state management is very simple and
02:31 - similar to
02:32 - just react.js i'm importing my use date
02:35 - i'm setting the count to it and then
02:37 - on handle press when you click the image
02:40 - i just increment the alert number by one
02:44 - other differences i noticed in react
02:46 - native as compared to react.js
02:49 - or most things are wrapped in view
02:51 - instead of a gsx
02:52 - fragment and you style the view with
02:55 - container
02:56 - and another thing is when i click it if
02:58 - you notice how that
03:00 - image actually does that little flashing
03:02 - thing is i
03:03 - wrap the image in something called
03:05 - touchable opacity
03:06 - and on press i make it do things
03:09 - so the image itself actually doesn't
03:12 - have an on
03:13 - press attribute but the touchable
03:15 - opacity
03:16 - does that i found a little bit odd and a
03:18 - little bit weird
03:20 - but you kind of get used to it and then
03:22 - image is just normal i pass in the
03:24 - source
03:25 - with a uri and we're good to go now i
03:28 - want to say a couple of things okay if
03:29 - you watch me do
03:30 - all of this in one day you're like how
03:32 - the hell did you do all this in one day
03:34 - well it's not one day it's years and
03:36 - years of work and
03:37 - understanding of how coding and
03:39 - development works once you know how to
03:41 - do that once i know how to do that
03:42 - it's really quite easy to pick things up
03:45 - so i'm not saying a complete
03:47 - beginner can do this in one day and now
03:50 - i want to leave you off with this
03:52 - you might be wondering hey kazi is this
03:54 - worth it
03:55 - for me to learn should i learn react
03:58 - native and my answer to you
04:00 - is this right react native the job
04:02 - opportunity for it is
04:04 - actually absolutely insane and according
04:07 - to zip recruiter and
04:08 - average react native developer makes
04:10 - about 150
04:12 - 000 a year and the reason is look most
04:15 - big companies are using react native
04:18 - like
04:18 - uber or ubereats whatever is a mobile
04:21 - app that you see out there
04:23 - is actually now on react native so it's
04:25 - a very hot technology for you to learn
04:28 - and if you know react js already then
04:31 - react native
04:32 - is the next logical stepping stone for
04:35 - you to learn as well
04:36 - so if you're interested in having a
04:37 - career that has a ton of longevity if
04:39 - you want to be able to have
04:41 - income potentials of 150 000 a year
04:44 - or more and you want to be able to work
04:46 - on really amazing
04:48 - and hot projects then i definitely
04:50 - recommend that you
04:51 - learn react native and tack it onto your
04:54 - react
04:55 - js that you already might know and it
04:57 - will make you so
04:59 - damn valuable in the job market and
05:01 - honestly even if you're new to coding
05:03 - you can still jump into react native and
05:05 - learn
05:06 - you don't need to be intermediate or
05:07 - advanced and don't let anybody tell you
05:09 - otherwise
05:10 - i'm also planning to launch a react
05:13 - native crash course which is just going
05:14 - to be
05:15 - all things react native so that's
05:17 - another reason why i'm actually wanting
05:18 - to learn this
05:20 - and again all of these goals go straight
05:22 - back
05:23 - into helping 5 000 people just like you
05:27 - get full-time jobs as developers at
05:30 - their dream
05:30 - job so if i'm putting out react native
05:33 - bills and tutorials
05:34 - you can put on your portfolio and my
05:36 - goal is and my hope is that you can take
05:38 - that to an employer
05:40 - and go give me that job so with that
05:43 - said look i'm going to start doing react
05:45 - native builds
05:45 - they're going to be fire you know how we
05:48 - do it at clever programmer it's going to
05:49 - be exciting
05:50 - now i want to turn it over to you as i'm
05:53 - going to be doing these react native
05:54 - builds
05:55 - i want to help develop your portfolio
05:58 - and help you land your dream job as a
06:00 - developer so tell me
06:01 - what do you want to see as the next
06:05 - build with that said this is quasi i
06:08 - want to hear from you
06:09 - and i'll see you in the next video
06:28 - you
