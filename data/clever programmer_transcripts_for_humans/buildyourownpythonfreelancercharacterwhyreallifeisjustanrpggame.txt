00:00 - I say build your Python freelance
00:02 - character is I remember when I was
00:05 - younger and I would play video games
00:06 - like Sims or like Skyrim or I used to
00:10 - play this one game called Dragon Age
00:12 - Origins and what what a lot of these
00:17 - games have in common is you have a
00:18 - character and whatever you do with this
00:22 - character you get these skill points and
00:24 - your guy becomes better and better in
00:26 - those particular skills so for example
00:29 - if you're playing a game like Dragon Age
00:30 - Origins and your f guy is focusing on
00:34 - being a mage and he's doing spells or
00:36 - whatever or if your guy is being an
00:39 - archer or a swordsman whatever as you
00:42 - spend more time with those weapons or
00:45 - those things your guy levels up in those
00:48 - skills or take Sims where when your guy
00:51 - spends more time reading books he
00:53 - becomes better at reading more books and
00:55 - also he becomes more knowledgeable so
00:58 - now he can make new foods that he
01:00 - couldn't make before and he can do a lot
01:02 - of things he couldn't do before or for
01:04 - if he spends more time in the gym
01:06 - your character is get those skill points
01:09 - in the gym he starts getting better and
01:11 - then it takes him longer to get hungry
01:12 - and all that and there was a point in my
01:17 - life where I kind of loved games and
01:19 - then what happened to me was I kind of
01:24 - realized that if you spend time on
01:29 - yourself and you build up those skill
01:34 - points just in life it's kind of the
01:39 - same way even though there's no gamma
01:42 - fication happening you know you're the
01:45 - gooey bars are actually not building up
01:46 - and you can't go somewhere you don't get
01:48 - a notification for it right and when you
01:51 - log into life when you wake up you don't
01:53 - get a little notification that goes OOP
01:55 - you got a hundred points for sleeping on
01:58 - time and getting seven and a half hours
02:00 - of sleep you don't get a little
02:01 - notification for going to the gym today
02:03 - you don't get a little notification for
02:05 - being nice to your parents you don't get
02:07 - a notification for getting your
02:09 - girlfriend a little gift and what starts
02:12 - to happen is
02:13 - when we don't have that instant
02:15 - gratification we look in other places
02:17 - those other places could be video games
02:20 - those other places could be things like
02:22 - drugs and alcohol and those other places
02:24 - could just be you know whatever like
02:27 - places where you're fine like Netflix
02:30 - you're watching stranger things
02:32 - you're watching house of cards you're
02:34 - binging on some anime you just found and
02:38 - that happens to us a lot and that
02:41 - happens to me at times too and as you
02:45 - compare what you're doing in those video
02:47 - games and in those movies and how the
02:51 - drugs and alcohol might make you feel
02:53 - with where you actually are in real life
02:57 - the contrast it kind of it hurts because
03:01 - one thing is so awesome and fun and
03:03 - instant gratification whereas this other
03:06 - thing you're getting farther and farther
03:08 - from your goals everyday you're just
03:09 - sitting there like if I just started
03:12 - going to the gym I had that thought like
03:15 - seven years ago and I thought I was too
03:18 - old to go to the gym seven years ago and
03:19 - if I just done it what would I look like
03:22 - right now or you have that thought oh
03:25 - man I knew I could have done that job or
03:27 - started that business and now my friends
03:30 - doing it and look how well he's doing or
03:32 - I should have started a YouTube channel
03:33 - and look where that would have been now
03:35 - or I should have done this for that and
03:37 - look where that would have been now but
03:40 - then BOOM switch let's watch some
03:42 - stranger things baby let's watch some
03:44 - house of cards let's watch some Fargo
03:46 - forget about everything else and we kind
03:52 - of get caught up in that but here's a
03:56 - cool thing if you can if you can get
03:58 - over that instant gratification thing a
04:01 - little bit and not getting those little
04:03 - notifications in life and you start to
04:05 - really focus every day you take 10 to 15
04:08 - minutes analyzing where you are your own
04:11 - life it's kind of like being that video
04:15 - game character if you spend more time
04:19 - dealing with tough tough conversations
04:22 - maybe you're at work at whatever your
04:24 - current job is and you go in to ask for
04:26 - that promotion
04:27 - feels uncomfortable your how it hurts
04:28 - pounding your hands are shaking you're
04:30 - sweating whoo scary right but when you
04:36 - go and do it and you get through it and
04:38 - maybe you get that promotion what just
04:41 - happened
04:42 - your skill points improved in
04:44 - negotiation and now you could use those
04:47 - skill points at other jobs isn't it
04:51 - freaking cool like after you kind of
04:54 - realize that why do you need to play
04:55 - Skyrim you kind of don't what happens
04:58 - when you put some time into going to the
05:00 - gym after a little bit weeks you know a
05:03 - few weeks you'll start to see some
05:05 - results and now you're putting points
05:08 - into your own physical fitness and
05:09 - getting better your character in real
05:11 - life is getting better and guess what
05:14 - when you put that controller away the
05:18 - character doesn't go away it's still
05:21 - there with you forever if the lights go
05:24 - out and the game ends or the hard drive
05:27 - crashes and all your saves are gone it
05:30 - doesn't matter because that character is
05:32 - you and that's there forever that
05:34 - doesn't run out of batteries if you
05:39 - spend time coding like Python for
05:42 - example or whatever language and you're
05:44 - coding you're building your coding
05:46 - skills tree you're becoming a better
05:48 - developer and if you spend time doing
05:52 - this and you're building cool projects
05:53 - it literally feels just like playing a
05:55 - game except you might be making six
05:59 - figures doing it isn't that nice now
06:03 - contrast that with playing video games
06:05 - watching stranger things abusing drugs
06:08 - and alcohol and sitting in your mom's
06:10 - basement versus playing this other game
06:14 - called being a developer web development
06:18 - working on projects that feel literally
06:20 - like a game except it's like a glitch in
06:22 - life and people are paying you money
06:24 - money for it and at the end of the day
06:27 - you have something to show for it and
06:29 - you're doing this from a nice apartment
06:31 - overlooking a lake or something I don't
06:34 - know whatever it is that you like to
06:35 - overlook maybe you could be overlooking
06:37 - dumpsters that's your thing I don't know
06:39 - I don't know that is something that
06:42 - excites me these skills if you work on
06:45 - them on your own in real life when
06:47 - everything else goes to these
06:49 - skills are there with you forever
06:52 - they're there with you to stay there
06:54 - with you and you're getting money as a
06:57 - benefit as a bonus and now you can not
07:01 - only support yourself but your family
07:04 - you also don't have to feel like you're
07:07 - you don't have confidence you also don't
07:08 - have to feel like you have that lack of
07:10 - control in life because doing these
07:15 - things and working on yourself
07:17 - gives you that control
07:19 - [Music]
