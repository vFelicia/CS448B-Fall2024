00:00 - hey guys what's up this is Kazi from
00:03 - clever programmer dot-com so in this
00:06 - video one of the things I want to talk
00:08 - about is money is good versus is money
00:13 - evil so which one is it we're gonna talk
00:15 - about this and the answer to this
00:17 - question or the explanation that that is
00:21 - gonna be within this video is going to
00:24 - even help you determine how much money
00:26 - you are going to be making your life's
00:28 - time and how financially free you are
00:31 - going to be and how financially free
00:33 - your family is going to be alright so
00:36 - that's it and you know what let's get it
00:40 - started
00:41 - drop the intro
00:43 - [Music]
00:52 - [Applause]
00:53 - all right so is money evil let's talk
00:57 - about that or is money bout first of all
00:59 - let's just talk about what money really
01:02 - is right money is a way for you to go
01:04 - from where you are to where you need to
01:06 - get to without really bartering with
01:09 - anything other than money itself okay so
01:14 - what this means is that instead of
01:15 - having to trade skills and do all that
01:17 - you can just give money to do all those
01:19 - things now there's some there's a
01:21 - misconception out there which is like
01:23 - money is evil and if you make pass a
01:26 - certain amount of money you're
01:28 - automatically put in this category like
01:30 - you're an evil person or this much money
01:34 - is just not useful so let me try to come
01:38 - a different perspective of somebody who
01:41 - you know like like I get it I don't get
01:44 - it anymore why people have such a strong
01:47 - pessimism so I'll try to connect with
01:50 - those people as well cuz I do know that
01:51 - there was a point in time that I was
01:53 - there but here's how I want to explain
01:55 - it okay money is not bad money just
01:59 - emphasizes what you are right now okay
02:02 - let's say you're a terrible terrible
02:04 - terrible human being
02:06 - well now you can just be even more of a
02:10 - terrible human being because you have
02:12 - money so you can influence the world to
02:14 - be worse okay now let's say that like
02:18 - you know Pablo Escobar from narcos now
02:20 - let's say you're an amazing person right
02:22 - you're a great person somebody like
02:24 - maybe even Anthony Robbins right I'd
02:26 - really look up to him Grant Cardone I
02:28 - really look up to them let's say you're
02:32 - somebody like that now when you have
02:33 - money and you have a good personality
02:34 - now that's something that's emphasized
02:37 - more right you're able to change the
02:39 - world for the better because you have
02:41 - money and now you can use it for that
02:43 - so money in itself is not evil or good
02:48 - but money is more good than evil you
02:50 - know something I say that I'm just
02:51 - joking around it's like what's worse
02:52 - than being rich being broke
02:54 - don't be broke this is important so a
02:55 - lot of people are like look I want to
02:58 - just make Kazi I just want to make
02:59 - enough money for myself okay so maybe
03:03 - that's $60,000
03:05 - or $70,000 a year but that's enough for
03:08 - most people and I get it that's good but
03:10 - I think that's selfish right and the
03:13 - reason why I think that's selfish and
03:15 - making more money than you need is
03:18 - actually self less and the reason why
03:21 - that is is because if you just make
03:23 - enough money for yourself you can't help
03:25 - anybody else let's say you have to put
03:27 - your parents through retirement which is
03:30 - actually one of my goals like give them
03:32 - an incredibly comfortable retirement
03:33 - that's not one of the things that really
03:36 - drives me you can do that right if
03:39 - something happens where there's an
03:40 - emergency like my mom goes through these
03:42 - surgeries she's at like three surgeries
03:44 - in just the last month but we weren't
03:46 - able to afford that so we had to wait
03:49 - for some of the surgeries for 12 years
03:51 - before we could get them okay so if we
03:55 - had money we would just be able to get
03:58 - that taken care of okay I would be able
04:02 - to help them out like I don't want to
04:03 - have just enough for myself I want to
04:05 - have more for other people around me in
04:08 - my life right so I can support them my
04:11 - family members my friends I can have a
04:14 - good time with them myself obviously
04:17 - maybe my kids when I have kids maybe my
04:20 - wife when I have a wife so basically I
04:22 - want to be able to help everybody in my
04:24 - life right not just myself and I want to
04:27 - be able to have influence in the world
04:29 - like if I see that there's injustice
04:31 - going on I want to be able to make an
04:34 - impact and not just like sit around be
04:36 - able to do nothing about it
04:38 - if I see that you know kids in a certain
04:40 - area need some kind of better
04:42 - educational system and they need a
04:44 - donation I want to be able to make that
04:46 - happen what I want you to do is pause
04:49 - this video after listening to when I'm
04:52 - about the same and really reflect like
04:54 - what would you do if you had the money
04:57 - how much money would make you happy how
05:01 - much money do you need to have a
05:03 - financially secure life or you know
05:06 - every year how much money do you need
05:09 - put away so you can support your family
05:12 - your friends and anybody that really
05:14 - needs it and how much money do you
05:16 - really need to live
05:18 - curious life like understand that money
05:20 - is not the root of evil poverty is the
05:24 - root of evil believe it or not right
05:25 - that's where if dealing comes from and
05:27 - like people get jealous envious all that
05:29 - but when everybody has enough
05:31 - everybody's okay right you're not trying
05:33 - to take it's like when they're little
05:35 - kids and if one of the kids doesn't get
05:38 - what he wants he'll fight the other kid
05:39 - but if all the kids have everything that
05:41 - they want they don't really go around
05:43 - fighting for no reason well sometimes
05:45 - they do but most of the times they don't
05:47 - because they have already what they need
05:48 - so this is very very important because
05:51 - most people don't negotiate their
05:54 - salaries higher and they just tend to
05:57 - stay at a low spot like 5060 thousand
06:00 - dollars a year maybe even lower because
06:02 - they're like oh well you know I just
06:05 - don't need any more money because they
06:06 - see it as evil they still have money
06:09 - problems like if you had more money you
06:11 - can have a personal chef if you had more
06:13 - money you could have somebody do your
06:15 - laundry if you had more money you could
06:17 - have somebody take care of the problems
06:18 - that you don't like so you can go on
06:20 - vacations enjoy your life make a better
06:24 - difference and impact in the world and
06:26 - you know really really leave a dent in
06:30 - this world right that's one of the
06:32 - things that it allows you to do fast for
06:34 - example one of the things I was using
06:36 - money for to increase my skills in
06:38 - programming so fast was I was a chess
06:41 - instructor okay I've told a story but
06:44 - maybe you're new to this channel in
06:45 - which case you know obviously subscribe
06:47 - please when I was making money through
06:49 - coaching students chess what I did is I
06:52 - just gave that money to professional
06:55 - developers so they could be my mentors
06:58 - and help me become a developer but a lot
07:01 - a lot faster you see so basically I was
07:03 - using money to gain skills and coding
07:05 - and just fast-track that progress so
07:08 - it's really cool there are a lot of
07:09 - things you can do with it like for
07:11 - example I have somebody helping me make
07:14 - this amazing video right now that would
07:17 - not be possible I have this beautiful
07:18 - person walking away looking at me like
07:21 - I'm a psychopath so that would not be
07:24 - possible if I didn't have money and I
07:26 - couldn't afford somebody you want to say
07:28 - hi come say hi hi how are you doing what
07:32 - do you
07:32 - thing about money do you think it's like
07:33 - evil or do you think it's like a good
07:35 - thing sometimes a good sometimes bad
07:40 - sometimes good sometimes bad so why do
07:44 - you think it's bad because people thinks
07:46 - like money is everything
07:47 - yeah but money is not everything okay if
07:51 - I could give you a million dollars would
07:53 - you be happier would you be like oh man
07:56 - that's not good in my situation yes not
07:59 - good
07:59 - really why is that because I might have
08:02 - more than a million dollar but I need my
08:05 - happiness okay why do you so what do you
08:08 - think what happens your happiness if I
08:10 - gave you a million dollars do you think
08:12 - you would go away more what's up well
08:15 - screw it more oh I will screw it more so
08:18 - you think you'll get sadder
08:21 - wouldn't you or do you worry about your
08:23 - bills and rent and stuff like that right
08:25 - now of course that's something that you
08:28 - have to worry about because that's how
08:30 - you have home or you want to have a car
08:32 - yeah I have a family or now I do have
08:37 - parents okay so like if you had more
08:40 - money and you can give them a more
08:41 - comfortable retirement would that make
08:43 - you happier of course so you could help
08:46 - them and then also help yourself less
08:48 - worrying about rents and everything well
08:51 - why would that make you sad er because
08:55 - okay my parents worry about their family
08:59 - but I'm at this point I don't care about
09:01 - their family anymore because I try to
09:04 - help but then my happiness does got sad
09:08 - sad sad and got to the point of like
09:11 - like the worst now okay because of money
09:14 - they feel jealous they want to have same
09:17 - thing like what I have but God like
09:21 - created us different right I mean there
09:24 - is a quality but like fair equal
09:28 - so I see so basically I think what
09:31 - you're saying is that some of your
09:33 - family members are jealous because you
09:36 - have more money than them money okay so
09:44 - to be fair to these people one possible
09:47 - solution is for you to go down right
09:49 - right right okay so one possible
09:53 - solution for these people that they see
09:54 - is for her to go down how about a better
09:57 - solution how about they try to get up to
10:00 - her level well they don't want to they
10:02 - choose not to they could have yeah they
10:05 - could have just follow my steps and be
10:08 - what I am but they choose to do it in a
10:11 - wrong way yeah and then guess what
10:13 - what are they yeah nowhere so whose
10:18 - fault is that
10:18 - right it's their fault exactly or
10:21 - whoever is making them go that high and
10:25 - then be nowhere now so basically can we
10:28 - agree that money is not evil it's that
10:31 - like what people can choose to do with
10:33 - it right like if you use it for evil
10:36 - things maybe it's bad but if you had a
10:37 - million dollars I feel like you would do
10:39 - some nice things with it you know maybe
10:41 - maybe spend it on family maybe help
10:43 - these these people come up to your level
10:45 - maybe pay off your bills well it's fine
10:50 - I have more than million dollars to me I
10:52 - am worth more than what million dollars
10:54 - my brain my education whatever all right
10:57 - I like her style thank you so much
10:59 - what's your name
11:00 - nor nor like light right my name is cozy
11:07 - like kamikaze like clever programmer
11:11 - cause nice meeting you watch this video
11:13 - on YouTube yes it's called clever
11:18 - programmer yes that's how we get
11:22 - subscribers eighty four thousand
11:24 - subscribers one person on the street at
11:26 - a time that's how you can do it too
11:35 - yes that's it and uh yes let's and then
11:41 - and then hit the bell hit the bow hit
11:44 - the bell as well yes that way that way
11:47 - you get all the notifications so you're
11:49 - gonna get it right because that yeah
11:51 - okay no or have a great night back to
11:54 - what I was saying money see this look
11:56 - look look I get it I get it I see where
11:59 - a lot of people come from right even
12:00 - Noor who was so amazing she had this
12:03 - like kind of animosity towards it but
12:06 - it's not coming from her if you really
12:08 - pay attention psychologically it's
12:10 - coming from the other people in her
12:12 - family making her feel bad about where
12:14 - she is in life right now right maybe she
12:17 - has better health better money and
12:19 - that's what a lot of your peers around
12:21 - you do if you really pay attention like
12:22 - they'll start ostracizing you from their
12:25 - groups if you start to become more fit
12:27 - than them if you start to get a I don't
12:29 - know better girlfriend than them if you
12:31 - start to make more money than them if
12:34 - you start being more successful or more
12:37 - famous than them if that starts
12:39 - happening I mean that's obviously one
12:40 - signal you shouldn't be around those
12:42 - people but that I have covered in
12:43 - another video right now I'm just talking
12:45 - about like money versus evil is it is it
12:48 - evil or is it good and where that
12:50 - mindset actually comes from right so
12:52 - it's a lot of it is deeply rooted
12:54 - psychologically culturally Society kind
12:57 - of instills that in you so understand
13:00 - that more money okay here's your answer
13:03 - somebody in the comments below please be
13:05 - that dude who's like thanks the video
13:08 - starts in nine minutes
13:10 - you know just put this answer in there
13:11 - so the answer is money is a good thing
13:15 - okay
13:16 - money is a good thing you have the power
13:19 - to do what you want with it but I think
13:21 - it has the power to change the world you
13:23 - can start your own company you can hire
13:25 - developers to start working towards
13:27 - making that app obviously if you just
13:29 - win money from a lottery you're probably
13:31 - just gonna waste it so I don't mean it
13:33 - just drops in your lap but striving and
13:35 - having a motivation to get that money
13:37 - you can make a lot of things happen
13:39 - right like I was saying in between like
13:42 - having a camera crew wasn't possible for
13:45 - me before so I had to make these low
13:47 - quality videos
13:48 - an editor for me wasn't possible before
13:51 - having a team that lets me launch his
13:53 - amazing products for you guys wasn't
13:55 - possible before right
13:57 - but money is something that allowed me
13:59 - to do that put that together okay so
14:01 - just some food for thought
14:03 - understand money is good and use that
14:05 - every day to give you that motivation to
14:07 - negotiate that higher salary learn those
14:10 - negotiation techniques become a better
14:12 - developer good be striving to make more
14:16 - money right
14:17 - you deserve to make more money so
14:19 - constantly be trying to get higher and
14:21 - higher on that level I want you guys are
14:24 - following this channel to not only get a
14:26 - freelancer job or a full-time developer
14:29 - job but one day I hope that you start
14:31 - your own company you know whether it is
14:33 - SAS or whatever software is a service
14:35 - thing or even if it's not in programming
14:37 - man like I want you guys to start your
14:39 - own thing you know that's why I push
14:41 - push push push push push so damn hard
14:44 - and motivate you guys because I want you

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys what's up this is Kazi from clever programmer dotcom so in this video one of the things I want to talk about is money is good versus is money evil so which one is it we're gonna talk about this and the answer to this question or the explanation that that is gonna be within this video is going to even help you determine how much money you are going to be making your life's time and how financially free you are going to be and how financially free your family is going to be alright so that's it and you know what let's get it started drop the intro all right so is money evil let's talk about that or is money bout first of all let's just talk about what money really is right money is a way for you to go from where you are to where you need to get to without really bartering with anything other than money itself okay so what this means is that instead of having to trade skills and do all that you can just give money to do all those things now there's some there's a misconception out there which is like money is evil and if you make pass a certain amount of money you're automatically put in this category like you're an evil person or this much money is just not useful so let me try to come a different perspective of somebody who you know like like I get it I don't get it anymore why people have such a strong pessimism so I'll try to connect with those people as well cuz I do know that there was a point in time that I was there but here's how I want to explain it okay money is not bad money just emphasizes what you are right now okay let's say you're a terrible terrible terrible human being well now you can just be even more of a terrible human being because you have money so you can influence the world to be worse okay now let's say that like you know Pablo Escobar from narcos now let's say you're an amazing person right you're a great person somebody like maybe even Anthony Robbins right I'd really look up to him Grant Cardone I really look up to them let's say you're somebody like that now when you have money and you have a good personality now that's something that's emphasized more right you're able to change the world for the better because you have money and now you can use it for that so money in itself is not evil or good but money is more good than evil you know something I say that I'm just joking around it's like what's worse than being rich being broke don't be broke this is important so a lot of people are like look I want to just make Kazi I just want to make enough money for myself okay so maybe that's $60,000 or $70,000 a year but that's enough for most people and I get it that's good but I think that's selfish right and the reason why I think that's selfish and making more money than you need is actually self less and the reason why that is is because if you just make enough money for yourself you can't help anybody else let's say you have to put your parents through retirement which is actually one of my goals like give them an incredibly comfortable retirement that's not one of the things that really drives me you can do that right if something happens where there's an emergency like my mom goes through these surgeries she's at like three surgeries in just the last month but we weren't able to afford that so we had to wait for some of the surgeries for 12 years before we could get them okay so if we had money we would just be able to get that taken care of okay I would be able to help them out like I don't want to have just enough for myself I want to have more for other people around me in my life right so I can support them my family members my friends I can have a good time with them myself obviously maybe my kids when I have kids maybe my wife when I have a wife so basically I want to be able to help everybody in my life right not just myself and I want to be able to have influence in the world like if I see that there's injustice going on I want to be able to make an impact and not just like sit around be able to do nothing about it if I see that you know kids in a certain area need some kind of better educational system and they need a donation I want to be able to make that happen what I want you to do is pause this video after listening to when I'm about the same and really reflect like what would you do if you had the money how much money would make you happy how much money do you need to have a financially secure life or you know every year how much money do you need put away so you can support your family your friends and anybody that really needs it and how much money do you really need to live curious life like understand that money is not the root of evil poverty is the root of evil believe it or not right that's where if dealing comes from and like people get jealous envious all that but when everybody has enough everybody's okay right you're not trying to take it's like when they're little kids and if one of the kids doesn't get what he wants he'll fight the other kid but if all the kids have everything that they want they don't really go around fighting for no reason well sometimes they do but most of the times they don't because they have already what they need so this is very very important because most people don't negotiate their salaries higher and they just tend to stay at a low spot like 5060 thousand dollars a year maybe even lower because they're like oh well you know I just don't need any more money because they see it as evil they still have money problems like if you had more money you can have a personal chef if you had more money you could have somebody do your laundry if you had more money you could have somebody take care of the problems that you don't like so you can go on vacations enjoy your life make a better difference and impact in the world and you know really really leave a dent in this world right that's one of the things that it allows you to do fast for example one of the things I was using money for to increase my skills in programming so fast was I was a chess instructor okay I've told a story but maybe you're new to this channel in which case you know obviously subscribe please when I was making money through coaching students chess what I did is I just gave that money to professional developers so they could be my mentors and help me become a developer but a lot a lot faster you see so basically I was using money to gain skills and coding and just fasttrack that progress so it's really cool there are a lot of things you can do with it like for example I have somebody helping me make this amazing video right now that would not be possible I have this beautiful person walking away looking at me like I'm a psychopath so that would not be possible if I didn't have money and I couldn't afford somebody you want to say hi come say hi hi how are you doing what do you thing about money do you think it's like evil or do you think it's like a good thing sometimes a good sometimes bad sometimes good sometimes bad so why do you think it's bad because people thinks like money is everything yeah but money is not everything okay if I could give you a million dollars would you be happier would you be like oh man that's not good in my situation yes not good really why is that because I might have more than a million dollar but I need my happiness okay why do you so what do you think what happens your happiness if I gave you a million dollars do you think you would go away more what's up well screw it more oh I will screw it more so you think you'll get sadder wouldn't you or do you worry about your bills and rent and stuff like that right now of course that's something that you have to worry about because that's how you have home or you want to have a car yeah I have a family or now I do have parents okay so like if you had more money and you can give them a more comfortable retirement would that make you happier of course so you could help them and then also help yourself less worrying about rents and everything well why would that make you sad er because okay my parents worry about their family but I'm at this point I don't care about their family anymore because I try to help but then my happiness does got sad sad sad and got to the point of like like the worst now okay because of money they feel jealous they want to have same thing like what I have but God like created us different right I mean there is a quality but like fair equal so I see so basically I think what you're saying is that some of your family members are jealous because you have more money than them money okay so to be fair to these people one possible solution is for you to go down right right right okay so one possible solution for these people that they see is for her to go down how about a better solution how about they try to get up to her level well they don't want to they choose not to they could have yeah they could have just follow my steps and be what I am but they choose to do it in a wrong way yeah and then guess what what are they yeah nowhere so whose fault is that right it's their fault exactly or whoever is making them go that high and then be nowhere now so basically can we agree that money is not evil it's that like what people can choose to do with it right like if you use it for evil things maybe it's bad but if you had a million dollars I feel like you would do some nice things with it you know maybe maybe spend it on family maybe help these these people come up to your level maybe pay off your bills well it's fine I have more than million dollars to me I am worth more than what million dollars my brain my education whatever all right I like her style thank you so much what's your name nor nor like light right my name is cozy like kamikaze like clever programmer cause nice meeting you watch this video on YouTube yes it's called clever programmer yes that's how we get subscribers eighty four thousand subscribers one person on the street at a time that's how you can do it too yes that's it and uh yes let's and then and then hit the bell hit the bow hit the bell as well yes that way that way you get all the notifications so you're gonna get it right because that yeah okay no or have a great night back to what I was saying money see this look look look I get it I get it I see where a lot of people come from right even Noor who was so amazing she had this like kind of animosity towards it but it's not coming from her if you really pay attention psychologically it's coming from the other people in her family making her feel bad about where she is in life right now right maybe she has better health better money and that's what a lot of your peers around you do if you really pay attention like they'll start ostracizing you from their groups if you start to become more fit than them if you start to get a I don't know better girlfriend than them if you start to make more money than them if you start being more successful or more famous than them if that starts happening I mean that's obviously one signal you shouldn't be around those people but that I have covered in another video right now I'm just talking about like money versus evil is it is it evil or is it good and where that mindset actually comes from right so it's a lot of it is deeply rooted psychologically culturally Society kind of instills that in you so understand that more money okay here's your answer somebody in the comments below please be that dude who's like thanks the video starts in nine minutes you know just put this answer in there so the answer is money is a good thing okay money is a good thing you have the power to do what you want with it but I think it has the power to change the world you can start your own company you can hire developers to start working towards making that app obviously if you just win money from a lottery you're probably just gonna waste it so I don't mean it just drops in your lap but striving and having a motivation to get that money you can make a lot of things happen right like I was saying in between like having a camera crew wasn't possible for me before so I had to make these low quality videos an editor for me wasn't possible before having a team that lets me launch his amazing products for you guys wasn't possible before right but money is something that allowed me to do that put that together okay so just some food for thought understand money is good and use that every day to give you that motivation to negotiate that higher salary learn those negotiation techniques become a better developer good be striving to make more money right you deserve to make more money so constantly be trying to get higher and higher on that level I want you guys are following this channel to not only get a freelancer job or a fulltime developer job but one day I hope that you start your own company you know whether it is SAS or whatever software is a service thing or even if it's not in programming man like I want you guys to start your own thing you know that's why I push push push push push push so damn hard and motivate you guys because I want you guys to achieve more than just like average salaries and stuff like that okay so that's it you know my camera guy must have fun he's awesome he's tired holding this camera and I think this video has come to a great conclusion if I have missed anything put in the comments below share your thoughts on this what do you think is money do you think it's evil or do you think it's good I'm gonna jump in there and talk back to you thank you for so so much for watching this video as always I love your faces off and I'll see you in the next
