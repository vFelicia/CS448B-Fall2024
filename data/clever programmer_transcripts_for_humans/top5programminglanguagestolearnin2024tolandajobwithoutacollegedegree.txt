00:00 - top five programming languages for you
00:02 - to learn to get a job in
00:04 - 2024 without needing a college degree
00:07 - and the last one is the absolute
00:09 - craziest one I can't wait to tell you
00:11 - about it now I've done videos on this
00:13 - exact topic for the last 5 years in a
00:15 - row we've gotten millions of views and
00:17 - we've helped thousands to hundreds of
00:20 - thousands of people get into the career
00:22 - of tech and land jobs as developers now
00:25 - before we get into the meat and potatoes
00:27 - of the video I do want to let you know
00:29 - that if you want to become developer you
00:31 - want to master Ai and Chad GPT because
00:33 - these are the modern tools that we all
00:35 - need to learn and you want to know how
00:38 - you can get a high-paying job where you
00:40 - can make six figures or Beyond as a
00:42 - developer especially moving in 2024 with
00:45 - AI and Chad GPT changing the entire
00:47 - landscape this training that I've made
00:50 - is for you and it is for complete
00:52 - beginners or if you have more experienc
00:54 - as a developer this training will walk
00:56 - you through your exact road map on how
00:58 - you can become successful I'll show you
01:00 - three app ideas with AI and Chad GPT
01:02 - that you could build and how you could
01:04 - get started with all of that today it's
01:07 - a short training that'll absolutely blow
01:09 - your mind so what I recommend you do is
01:11 - go click the link below and check that
01:13 - training out and sign up for it it's a
01:15 - live changing training with that out of
01:18 - the way let's continue so we're going to
01:20 - be ranking these programming languages
01:22 - on three main factors Factor number one
01:26 - The Learning Time how long does it take
01:28 - you to learn this pram programming
01:30 - language essentially how easy is it
01:32 - Factor number two we're going to rank It
01:34 - On Demand and salary meaning how much do
01:37 - you get paid for these languages to
01:39 - learn and what is the demand meaning how
01:42 - many job opportunities are out there and
01:44 - is it something that's growing or dying
01:46 - and Factor number three is productivity
01:49 - meaning if you learn this language how
01:52 - quickly can you start building apps how
01:55 - quickly can you get to the end result
01:58 - and so that's what we're going to cover
01:59 - on point number number three now again
02:01 - wait till you hear the last one because
02:02 - I promise you nobody's talking about
02:04 - this and nobody in any of their videos
02:07 - has mentioned this for number one but I
02:09 - will so it'll blow your mind let's start
02:12 - number five Java Java Powers over three
02:15 - billion Android devices it's the seventh
02:18 - most popular language on stack Overflow
02:21 - the average salary of a Java developer
02:24 - is
02:26 - $117,000 per year according to indeed do
02:30 - there are 21,000 job openings currently
02:33 - which means there's a ton of jobs Java's
02:35 - Community is banging there's about 7
02:39 - million active developers in Java right
02:41 - now so if you need help with anything
02:44 - related to Java you'll most certainly be
02:46 - able to get it and popular companies
02:49 - like Google eBay and Amazon use Java in
02:53 - a lot of other companies drawback of
02:55 - java and why it's ranked number five and
02:58 - not number one is it is is much more
03:00 - difficult to learn it uses
03:02 - object-oriented programming which is
03:04 - much harder to pick up and honestly most
03:06 - of the coding is leaning away from it
03:08 - going into functional programming now
03:10 - and the other con is that look if you're
03:11 - doing Java development you're
03:13 - contributing to the world of those nasty
03:15 - green SMS text messages that we hate
03:18 - seeing so do yourself a favor and if
03:20 - you're going to go Java instead just go
03:23 - Swift and build for iOS and Max because
03:26 - that's what actually matters I know I
03:28 - just burned 99% of my audience but I
03:31 - don't care I am a hardcore Apple fan and
03:35 - so I will say it cuz my platform let's
03:38 - continue number four typescript this
03:41 - programming language is built on top of
03:44 - JavaScript which is one of the most
03:45 - popular programming languages typescript
03:48 - developers on average make around
03:51 - $129,000 a year or more job opportunity
03:55 - is a ton with typescript there's
03:57 - currently 177,000 jobs available right
04:00 - now typescript is used by Massive
04:03 - companies like GitHub slack and
04:05 - Microsoft what typescript is most known
04:08 - for is building web applications one
04:11 - cool thing about typescript is that if
04:13 - you look on stack Overflow it's one of
04:14 - the most loved programming languages in
04:17 - the world and it is largely growing the
04:20 - reason why it's number four and not
04:22 - number one is because it is harder to
04:25 - learn than JavaScript because in order
04:27 - to learn typescript you have to actually
04:29 - learn JavaScript first because
04:31 - JavaScript is actually a subset of
04:33 - typescript so there's a lot more to
04:35 - learn it is bit more difficult and you
04:38 - have to learn about how to use types in
04:40 - your coding which not everybody wants to
04:42 - learn because as developers we just want
04:44 - to continue building and not do a lot of
04:46 - the other work like adding type safety
04:47 - which is actually one of the best
04:49 - features in use cases of typescript
04:52 - meaning practically speaking if I was to
04:54 - explain to you in plain English is that
04:57 - yes when you're making your code safer
04:59 - why while it is annoying eventually you
05:01 - will end up saving a ton of time because
05:03 - you won't run into the same bugs that
05:05 - you would have ran into had you use some
05:07 - other programming language that doesn't
05:09 - have type safety baked into it number
05:11 - three python this is one of my personal
05:15 - favorites this is also the first love of
05:18 - my life the first programming language I
05:20 - learned and the first programming
05:22 - language I used to get my first job and
05:25 - start making six figures as a developer
05:27 - within my first year python is most
05:30 - known for things like data science data
05:33 - analytics or scripting and automating
05:37 - the cool thing is that python is also
05:39 - multi-purpose which means you could do a
05:40 - lot of web development with it too using
05:43 - D Jango and flask in fact some of the
05:46 - biggest companies in the world use
05:48 - Python like Spotify Google quora Dropbox
05:52 - and many many others it's one of the
05:54 - easiest programming languages to learn
05:56 - it has been growing for the last decade
05:58 - and it continues to keep on growing and
06:02 - the community for python is also massive
06:04 - according to zip recruiter the average
06:07 - salary of a python developer is
06:10 - $148,000 per year so if you chose python
06:14 - you can't really go that wrong number
06:16 - two JavaScript now I know this is crazy
06:20 - because the last many many many years I
06:23 - actually put Javascript number one which
06:25 - is why I want you to stick around till
06:27 - the end of the video to find out what is
06:28 - actually number one but JavaScript is
06:31 - one of the most popular languages used
06:33 - almost everywhere in the world every
06:36 - single website you go to and JavaScript
06:38 - is most known for its web development
06:41 - JavaScript is used by Google Spotify
06:43 - quora many many companies almost every
06:46 - single company in the world GitHub slack
06:48 - Reddit whatever you can think of is
06:50 - using JavaScript right now as long as
06:53 - it's a web app it is using JavaScript
06:56 - pretty much guaranteed whether you watch
06:58 - Netflix or your reviewing this video on
07:00 - YouTube you're using JavaScript without
07:03 - that you wouldn't be able to watch this
07:04 - video watch Netflix watch your favorite
07:07 - TV shows on Hulu or whatever other
07:09 - platform you use job roles for
07:11 - JavaScript are front-end developer
07:13 - back-end developer full stack developer
07:15 - in Hell data scientist any of those
07:17 - other ones too but again it's mostly
07:19 - known for web development average full
07:21 - stack developer salary is around
07:25 - $117,000 per year now when I say average
07:28 - that doesn't mean that's your first job
07:30 - ever if you're a junior developer
07:32 - meaning your first job you're looking at
07:34 - realistically making 60 70 $80,000 a
07:37 - year a lot of our people that we
07:40 - actually help get jobs most of them on
07:42 - average land their first job for 79,000
07:45 - and around $800 meaning about $80,000 is
07:48 - a median salary we've helped countless
07:51 - hundreds of developers help land at
07:54 - software developer companies so this is
07:56 - why I chose JavaScript to be one of the
07:58 - most popular populars and put it number
08:00 - two and here is the big one the one that
08:04 - you've been waiting for drum rolls
08:06 - please number one programming language
08:09 - in the world right now is English this
08:13 - caught you off guard I know and by
08:15 - English I mean the language of your
08:17 - choice whatever tongue that you speak in
08:20 - why because chat GPT and AI is here
08:24 - which means that if you go to Chad GPT
08:26 - and tell it what you wanted to build it
08:29 - will build it for you do you wanted to
08:31 - build a to-do list app do you wanted to
08:33 - build a front-end app a backend app an
08:35 - app like slack whatever you wanted to
08:37 - build with enough guidance and prompt
08:39 - engineering and instruction you could
08:41 - get it to build that before back in the
08:43 - day we used to have you know our laptop
08:45 - we had to focus on how the electricity
08:47 - is moving through our laptop right
08:48 - people had to learn that in order to be
08:50 - able to build a laptop but once you have
08:52 - a laptop you don't need to know all of
08:55 - that stuff because now we can interface
08:56 - with the laptop by just pressing buttons
08:58 - right we don't need to learn how the
09:00 - electricity in our wires are moving
09:02 - before we used to be able to walk and
09:04 - just had walking then we had horses and
09:06 - then we got cars right so we had
09:09 - assembly programming language back in
09:11 - the day which we can still use obviously
09:13 - but that's what people use all the time
09:15 - then we got something that made it
09:16 - easier and went higher level which was
09:18 - JavaScript and now we got something even
09:21 - higher than that so we went from horse
09:23 - think of JavaScript as a horse think of
09:25 - Assembly Language as walking and think
09:27 - of a car think of English as a car
09:30 - meaning now we could talk to Chad GPT
09:33 - and operate at the speed of a car
09:34 - meaning we could talk to Chad GPT and
09:36 - operate at the speed of a team of
09:38 - developers by giving it the right things
09:41 - to ask to build now it's more like
09:44 - you're a CEO of a company you have a
09:45 - bunch of Junior developers and you give
09:47 - them Direction on what to build and if
09:49 - they make mistakes you go in you fix a
09:51 - bug here and there for which you still
09:53 - need to know some programming and some
09:55 - understanding of how it works of course
09:57 - but largely you could actually give it
09:59 - to Chad GPT and I'm exper speaking from
10:02 - experience so not some random influencer
10:04 - who's just making another video on this
10:06 - because I built my own apps in the last
10:08 - couple of months I took a month Hiatus
10:10 - went completely dark Built My Own SAS
10:12 - MVP for a tool I built the AI tool that
10:15 - could take video clips you give it a
10:16 - long form video podcast 2 hours long it
10:19 - will automatically cut and find all the
10:21 - clips for you using Ai and I built that
10:24 - heavily heavily heavily with Chad GPT to
10:26 - put in perspective that's something I
10:28 - normally because I've hired a lot of
10:29 - software developers to work on my team I
10:32 - would have paid $660,000 to about four
10:35 - or five developers over the span of 3
10:37 - months but that app I built by myself
10:40 - alone in one month I still had to spend
10:42 - a lot of time couple of hundred hours
10:45 - but I built it in one month alone for
10:47 - free using chat GPT and AI so this
10:50 - opportunity is literally a once in
10:53 - a-lifetime Opportunity because this
10:55 - invention is the same big breakthrough
10:58 - we have had when we discovered
11:00 - electricity and then after electricity
11:02 - the big breakthrough we had was we
11:04 - discovered the internet and after the
11:07 - internet since the internet the biggest
11:08 - Innovation we've had by far is chat GPT
11:11 - this is why I'm taking hundreds of
11:13 - students and having them go through my
11:16 - profit with the I CH GPT course where
11:18 - we're showing them how to build apps
11:21 - even if they have very little experience
11:23 - coding I have a ton of people who are
11:26 - very sophisticated in different
11:27 - Industries product manager marketing
11:30 - operations some people who are software
11:32 - developers a bunch of people who are
11:33 - just looking to learn how to code and
11:35 - everybody in between and these people
11:38 - are saying that they're building their
11:39 - first app within 5 minutes in the course
11:42 - I have people building their first app
11:43 - and even learning how to sell it within
11:45 - their first one to two days of being
11:48 - inside of this course so if you are
11:51 - interested in learning how to build
11:54 - these apps and learning what kind of AI
11:56 - apps you can build learning how you can
11:58 - monetize ize it learning that is it even
12:01 - possible for you to do all of this with
12:03 - little to no experience then here's what
12:05 - I recommend I've put together a webinar
12:07 - for you a training a video training
12:09 - Below in the description go ahead click
12:12 - it and jump into that because I want to
12:14 - show you how you can use English or your
12:17 - native tongue to build mindblowing apps
12:21 - within 20 10 to 20 minutes that you
12:24 - could show off to your friends that
12:26 - could help you land the promotion that
12:28 - could help you to land your dream job
12:30 - and have a successful career that could
12:32 - take you from being one of those people
12:34 - that gets replaced to being somebody who
12:36 - has enough skill that is irreplaceable
12:38 - so the AI is coming is going to be
12:40 - taking a lot of jobs and the only
12:42 - question is are you going to be somebody
12:44 - who knows how to use it and are going to
12:46 - be Irreplaceable or are you going to be
12:47 - somebody who makes it Go by the wayside
12:49 - ignores it and is the one that ends up
12:52 - getting replaced so if you want to be on
12:54 - the right side of the history I highly
12:55 - recommend click the link below join the
12:57 - training it's only 19 minutes long and
12:59 - it has the power to change your entire
13:01 - life and it's completely free I forgot

13:05 - I've put together for you you don't have
13:06 - to pay anything for it so go ahead sign
13:08 - up for it I want to see you inside that
13:10 - training and I think it will absolutely
13:12 - blow your mind with that said I hope
13:14 - this video was informative to you and it
13:16 - showed you why I ordered the language in
13:18 - the way that I ordered and that the
13:20 - opportunity lies with the people now who
13:22 - learn how to use AI chat GPT to be able
13:25 - to build apps and profit with it and
13:28 - I'll also show show you how to make
13:29 - money with it so sign up for that
13:31 - training I love your face this is Cy and
13:33 - as always I'll see you in the next video
13:35 - peace

Cleaned transcript:

top five programming languages for you to learn to get a job in 2024 without needing a college degree and the last one is the absolute craziest one I can't wait to tell you about it now I've done videos on this exact topic for the last 5 years in a row we've gotten millions of views and we've helped thousands to hundreds of thousands of people get into the career of tech and land jobs as developers now before we get into the meat and potatoes of the video I do want to let you know that if you want to become developer you want to master Ai and Chad GPT because these are the modern tools that we all need to learn and you want to know how you can get a highpaying job where you can make six figures or Beyond as a developer especially moving in 2024 with AI and Chad GPT changing the entire landscape this training that I've made is for you and it is for complete beginners or if you have more experienc as a developer this training will walk you through your exact road map on how you can become successful I'll show you three app ideas with AI and Chad GPT that you could build and how you could get started with all of that today it's a short training that'll absolutely blow your mind so what I recommend you do is go click the link below and check that training out and sign up for it it's a live changing training with that out of the way let's continue so we're going to be ranking these programming languages on three main factors Factor number one The Learning Time how long does it take you to learn this pram programming language essentially how easy is it Factor number two we're going to rank It On Demand and salary meaning how much do you get paid for these languages to learn and what is the demand meaning how many job opportunities are out there and is it something that's growing or dying and Factor number three is productivity meaning if you learn this language how quickly can you start building apps how quickly can you get to the end result and so that's what we're going to cover on point number number three now again wait till you hear the last one because I promise you nobody's talking about this and nobody in any of their videos has mentioned this for number one but I will so it'll blow your mind let's start number five Java Java Powers over three billion Android devices it's the seventh most popular language on stack Overflow the average salary of a Java developer is $117,000 per year according to indeed do there are 21,000 job openings currently which means there's a ton of jobs Java's Community is banging there's about 7 million active developers in Java right now so if you need help with anything related to Java you'll most certainly be able to get it and popular companies like Google eBay and Amazon use Java in a lot of other companies drawback of java and why it's ranked number five and not number one is it is is much more difficult to learn it uses objectoriented programming which is much harder to pick up and honestly most of the coding is leaning away from it going into functional programming now and the other con is that look if you're doing Java development you're contributing to the world of those nasty green SMS text messages that we hate seeing so do yourself a favor and if you're going to go Java instead just go Swift and build for iOS and Max because that's what actually matters I know I just burned 99% of my audience but I don't care I am a hardcore Apple fan and so I will say it cuz my platform let's continue number four typescript this programming language is built on top of JavaScript which is one of the most popular programming languages typescript developers on average make around $129,000 a year or more job opportunity is a ton with typescript there's currently 177,000 jobs available right now typescript is used by Massive companies like GitHub slack and Microsoft what typescript is most known for is building web applications one cool thing about typescript is that if you look on stack Overflow it's one of the most loved programming languages in the world and it is largely growing the reason why it's number four and not number one is because it is harder to learn than JavaScript because in order to learn typescript you have to actually learn JavaScript first because JavaScript is actually a subset of typescript so there's a lot more to learn it is bit

your code safer why while it is annoying eventually you will end up saving a ton of time because you won't run into the same bugs that you would have ran into had you use some other programming language that doesn't have type safety baked into it number three python this is one of my personal favorites this is also the first love of my life the first programming language I learned and the first programming language I used to get my first job and start making six figures as a developer within my first year python is most known for things like data science data analytics or scripting and automating the cool thing is that python is also multipurpose which means you could do a lot of web development with it too using D Jango and flask in fact some of the biggest companies in the world use Python like Spotify Google quora Dropbox and many many others it's one of the easiest programming languages to learn it has been growing for the last decade and it continues to keep on growing and the community for python is also massive according to zip recruiter the average salary of a python developer is $148,000 per year so if you chose python you can't really go that wrong number two JavaScript now I know this is crazy because the last many many many years I actually put Javascript number one which is why I want you to stick around till the end of the video to find out what is actually number one but JavaScript is one of the most popular languages used almost everywhere in the world every single website you go to and JavaScript is most known for its web development JavaScript is used by Google Spotify quora many many companies almost every single company in the world GitHub slack Reddit whatever you can think of is using JavaScript right now as long as it's a web app it is using JavaScript pretty much guaranteed whether you watch Netflix or your reviewing this video on YouTube you're using JavaScript without that you wouldn't be able to watch this video watch Netflix watch your favorite TV shows on Hulu or whatever other platform you use job roles for JavaScript are frontend developer backend developer full stack developer in Hell data scientist any of those other ones too but again it's mostly known for web development average full stack developer salary is around $117,000 per year now when I say average that doesn't mean that's your first job ever if you're a junior developer meaning your first job you're looking at realistically making 60 70 $80,000 a year a lot of our people that we actually help get jobs most of them on average land their first job for 79,000 and around $800 meaning about $80,000 is a median salary we've helped countless hundreds of developers help land at software developer companies so this is why I chose JavaScript to be one of the most popular populars and put it number two and here is the big one the one that you've been waiting for drum rolls please number one programming language in the world right now is English this caught you off guard I know and by English I mean the language of your choice whatever tongue that you speak in why because chat GPT and AI is here which means that if you go to Chad GPT and tell it what you wanted to build it will build it for you do you wanted to build a todo list app do you wanted to build a frontend app a backend app an app like slack whatever you

heavily heavily heavily with Chad GPT to put in perspective that's something I normally because I've hired a lot of software developers to work on my team I would have paid $660,000 to about four or five developers over the span of 3 months but that app I built by myself alone in one month I still had to spend a lot of time couple of hundred hours but I built it in one month alone for free using chat GPT and AI so this opportunity is literally a once in alifetime Opportunity because this invention is the same big breakthrough we have had when we discovered electricity and then after electricity the big breakthrough we had was we discovered the internet and after the internet since the internet the biggest Innovation we've had by far is chat GPT this is why I'm taking hundreds of students and having them go through my profit with the I CH GPT course where we're showing them how to build apps even if they have very little experience coding I have a ton of people who are very sophisticated in different Industries product manager marketing operations some people who are software developers a bunch of people who are just looking to learn how to code and everybody in between and these people are saying that they're building their first app within 5 minutes in the course I have people building their first app and even learning how to sell it within their first one to two days of being inside of this course so if you are interested in learning how to build these apps and learning what kind of AI apps you can build learning how you can monetize ize it learning that is it even possible for you to do all of this with little to no experience then here's what I recommend I've put together a webinar for you a training a video training Below in the description go ahead click it and jump into that because I want to show you how you can use English or your native tongue to build mindblowing apps within 20 10 to 20 minutes that you could show off to your friends that could help you land the promotion that could help you to land your dream job and have a successful career that could take you from being one of those people that gets replaced to being somebody who has enough skill that is irreplaceable so the AI is coming is going to be taking a lot of jobs and the only question is are you going to be somebody who knows how to use it and are going to be Irreplaceable or are you going to be somebody who makes it Go by the wayside ignores it and is the one that ends up getting replaced so if you want to be on the right side of the history I highly
