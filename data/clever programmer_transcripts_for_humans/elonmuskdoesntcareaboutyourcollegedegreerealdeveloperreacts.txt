00:00 - there's no need even to have a college
00:01 - degree
00:03 - a lot of you keep asking me do you need
00:06 - a college degree to become a successful
00:09 - web developer software developer a full
00:12 - stack developer and in this video we're
00:15 - gonna take not my word but elon's word
00:19 - and see what he has to say about the
00:21 - subject with that said smash the like
00:24 - button so this video goes out to as many
00:26 - people as possible and with that said
00:27 - let's jump right into it
00:31 - there's no need even to have a college
00:33 - degree
00:34 - at all or even high school the wow
00:39 - that's a really bold statement no need
00:42 - to even have a college degree but let's
00:46 - see what he has to expound on that
00:49 - um I mean if somebody graduated from a
00:51 - great University that maybe in Indy that
00:53 - may be an indication that they will be
00:55 - capable of great things but so for me
00:57 - one of the big takes takeaways from this
00:59 - is graduating from a university might be
01:03 - a good indicator that you might be
01:05 - likely likely to succeed but it isn't
01:08 - and all be all great things but it's not
01:11 - necessarily the case
01:13 - you know if you look at um say people
01:16 - like Bill Gates or Larry Ellison Steve
01:19 - Jobs
01:20 - these guys didn't graduate from college
01:23 - that's true
01:25 - take a look at these people right that
01:27 - he mentioned Larry Page the founder of
01:29 - Google Bill Gates founder of Microsoft
01:33 - they did not actually graduate from
01:36 - college but watch what he actually says
01:39 - next I think that's important
01:41 - but if you had a chance to hire them of
01:43 - course that would be a good idea
01:46 - whoa Elon you're right about that if I
01:49 - had uh Bill Gates knocking on my door I
01:51 - think I would take him up on his offer
01:54 - so you know just looking just for
01:57 - evidence of exceptional ability looking
02:00 - for evidence for exceptional ability now
02:03 - let's see what he means when he says
02:05 - that
02:06 - of exceptional ability and if there's a
02:09 - track record of exceptional achievement
02:11 - then it's likely that that will continue
02:13 - into the future
02:14 - so Elon looks for a track record of
02:19 - exceptional ability okay so what does
02:22 - that mean for you well what that means
02:25 - for what that might mean for a software
02:27 - developer or somebody who wants to
02:29 - become a full stack developer is stop
02:31 - looking around for I need a piece of
02:34 - paper that's worth sixty thousand
02:36 - dollars I need this
02:37 - that's not what you actually need what
02:41 - you actually need is a solid skill set
02:44 - skills that you could show from your
02:46 - portfolio skills that you could show
02:48 - when you're on that job interview
02:51 - and skills you can use to actually get a
02:54 - job because when people bring you in
02:57 - that's mainly what they're looking for
02:59 - okay so for you it doesn't ultimately
03:02 - matter that much that you don't have a
03:06 - certification or you don't have a piece
03:07 - of paper now of course it depends what
03:10 - school or or sorry what job you're
03:12 - trying to get into
03:14 - if you're trying to become a data
03:15 - scientist there might require you to
03:17 - have a PhD
03:18 - but for Elon what he says is I want to
03:21 - see if you have a proven track record of
03:23 - exceptional ability and in my opinion
03:25 - the best way to show that you have
03:26 - exceptional ability is to show that by
03:30 - your skill set okay and also by a
03:33 - foundation of projects that you might
03:35 - have built now you might ask Elon but
03:37 - what if I do want to learn and I do want
03:40 - to educate myself what should I be
03:43 - working on because not all learning can
03:45 - be that bad right so what are the skills
03:48 - I should pick up when I want to actually
03:50 - improve my skill set and here's what
03:52 - Elon has to say
03:54 - to cater the education to match their
03:57 - aptitudes and abilities so I think
03:59 - that's one principle another is that
04:02 - it's important to teach
04:03 - teach problem solving or teach to the
04:06 - problem not to the tools so this would
04:09 - be like
04:10 - let's say so that's something really
04:12 - important teach to the problem not to
04:15 - the tools this is one of the reasons why
04:18 - I talk so much about hey let's learn
04:21 - problem solving right this is why on
04:24 - this channel you hear us constantly talk
04:26 - about problem solving doing data
04:28 - structures and algorithms going and
04:30 - doing coding challenges on platforms
04:33 - like hacker rank or Coursera or
04:35 - codecademy whatever have you wherever
04:38 - you can find you know you can go and
04:42 - actually do problems problem solving
04:45 - do that okay and that actually builds up
04:48 - your skill set and that's how you
04:50 - discover problem solving and you start
04:52 - to understand it at a deeper level
04:55 - as I was watching this elon's video I
04:59 - found a comment underneath it that's
05:01 - actually really fascinating and I'd like
05:03 - us to unpack that together and it's by
05:05 - Derek Poland and he said there's a
05:07 - difference between dropping out of
05:09 - college because you are a genius with an
05:11 - idea for a company that you're willing
05:13 - to spend a hundred plus hours a week on
05:17 - versus dropping out because you are lazy
05:22 - so that is one huge thing that you have
05:25 - to keep in mind now that genius part of
05:29 - that sentence I don't know if I agree
05:31 - with that but you can drop out of
05:34 - college and work on a lot of other
05:35 - things for example if you want to become
05:37 - a software developer you can become a
05:38 - freelance developer you could become a
05:41 - software developer at big companies
05:43 - without the need to go to college or
05:44 - spend a lot of money you could go and
05:46 - learn all the things on your own you
05:48 - could go on YouTube and watch content
05:50 - you could find mentors right you can
05:53 - find there are plenty of other ways
05:55 - people can go to a coding boot camp
05:57 - people can go take online classes people
06:00 - can watch content for free and you can
06:03 - learn and actually get a job so I don't
06:05 - think you need to be a genius to need to
06:08 - drop out of college I don't think
06:10 - necessarily needing an idea is a huge
06:13 - Factor either so something to just keep
06:15 - in mind because I know these are like if
06:17 - it has 23 000 likes I know a lot of
06:19 - people agree with it if a lot of people
06:20 - agree with it you might agree with it
06:22 - and I wanted to just get in there in
06:24 - your head and kind of unpack and debunk
06:26 - that a little bit before we continue on
06:28 - I want to end the video on one bonus
06:31 - clip from Bill Gates and his family
06:34 - basically
06:36 - um uh Bill Gates actually ended up
06:39 - dropping out of college as well and uh
06:42 - his family paid his parents paid for his
06:44 - tuition
06:45 - and he was like yeah I'm just gonna take
06:47 - a little bit of time off and then Watch
06:49 - What Happens so I'm gonna just cut to
06:51 - that part of the interview
06:53 - well they were very generous they
06:55 - um you know paid for my tuition at the
06:58 - time officially I went on leave and so
07:01 - you know if the company hadn't gone well
07:04 - uh Harvard's very generous about letting
07:07 - people come back so
07:08 - I actually really love this one and by
07:11 - the way this video is by uh Evan
07:14 - Carmichael he put this video up uh but
07:17 - anyways so you guys could go check that
07:19 - out if you wanted to but I thought this
07:20 - was really fascinating because that's
07:22 - exactly what I did to grow clever
07:23 - programmer as a business I took
07:26 - I was like okay what do I know I know
07:28 - the skill of software development where
07:30 - do I have more leverage and teaching
07:32 - other people how to become software
07:34 - developers because I had done it myself
07:36 - I had done it very very successfully and
07:38 - I was making a six-figure income at the
07:40 - age of 21 right I was making over a
07:41 - hundred thousand dollars a year at 21
07:43 - and people were like hey how are you
07:46 - doing this and a lot of people started
07:48 - asking me that and and I started a
07:50 - YouTube channel and started taking off
07:51 - uh really really quickly
07:54 - and what I did at the end of 2016 was go
07:58 - hey I'm just going to take one semester
08:00 - off like just one semester right I'm
08:03 - gonna take that off and I'm gonna see
08:04 - what happens and if that doesn't work
08:06 - out then I can still go back to college
08:09 - so I technically didn't just you know in
08:12 - my mind it wasn't like a drop drop out
08:14 - now granted the difference between me
08:16 - and Bill Gates is he dropped out of
08:19 - Harvard right I dropped out of a
08:21 - community college I was Oakton Community
08:22 - College I had a terrible GPA I wasn't I
08:25 - don't have a 155 IQ like Bill Gates here
08:28 - does right and um so I find that part
08:31 - actually really fascinating and that's
08:33 - also what he did
08:35 - permanent thing so you never expect so
08:37 - you are thinking at some point I'll end
08:38 - up going back and finishing I wasn't but
08:41 - yeah if I'd been unrealistic in the the
08:44 - business hadn't worked out I could have
08:46 - and
08:48 - so you know my last parting Thoughts
08:51 - with this are
08:53 - a lot of people when they think of
08:55 - dropping out of college or you know
08:58 - stopping College they think of this big
09:00 - freaking thing where you have to sign
09:02 - the stamp of approval where you can just
09:04 - never ever in your life ever go back
09:08 - and I think that messes you up because
09:10 - then you think it's this either or thing
09:12 - whereas how garyvee says it can be an
09:15 - and thing where you can go do the thing
09:17 - that you really want to do and then you
09:19 - have three months to prove to yourself
09:21 - that you are going to do this thing that
09:23 - you're going to make something of
09:24 - yourself that you're going to make your
09:25 - dreams a reality that you actually are
09:28 - going to put in the hard work that you
09:30 - told yourself and everybody else around
09:31 - you that you would
09:34 - that's what that like time off that
09:37 - little semester off or whatever it may
09:39 - be allows you to actually be able to do
09:41 - so my parting words to you are if you
09:45 - are considering dropping out of college
09:47 - or stopping College uh and if you're not
09:50 - right if you're already out of college
09:51 - uh and and you're doing a job and you're
09:54 - like yeah I want to become a software
09:55 - developer first of all you don't need a
09:57 - degree right and second of all if you
09:59 - are thinking about if you're somebody in
10:00 - college and you're thinking about
10:01 - dropping out you don't have to think
10:03 - about this this and uh this or thing you
10:07 - could go hey I can actually take a
10:09 - semester off
10:10 - and I can always go back if I feel like
10:12 - I'm not putting in the right effort if I
10:14 - feel like things aren't working out the
10:15 - way I plan right it could be your backup
10:17 - plan and there's nothing wrong with that
10:19 - right Bill Gates has done it
10:21 - um I'm nowhere near as successful as
10:24 - Bill Gates but I myself have also done
10:26 - that and it turned out well so
10:29 - think about that hopefully it gives you
10:32 - some more options some broader
10:33 - perspective it's not this either or
10:35 - thing the world doesn't end if you don't
10:37 - have a college degree I know it kills
10:40 - some of us in our heads and we let it
10:42 - become this huge limiting belief
10:45 - but I just want to let you know look
10:46 - it's okay if you went to college great
10:48 - if you enjoyed it great but if you
10:50 - didn't that's also okay and you can
10:53 - still make something of your life and
10:54 - you can still get a job as a software
10:57 - developer you can still become a full
10:58 - stack developer okay that's it this is

Cleaned transcript:

there's no need even to have a college degree a lot of you keep asking me do you need a college degree to become a successful web developer software developer a full stack developer and in this video we're gonna take not my word but elon's word and see what he has to say about the subject with that said smash the like button so this video goes out to as many people as possible and with that said let's jump right into it there's no need even to have a college degree at all or even high school the wow that's a really bold statement no need to even have a college degree but let's see what he has to expound on that um I mean if somebody graduated from a great University that maybe in Indy that may be an indication that they will be capable of great things but so for me one of the big takes takeaways from this is graduating from a university might be a good indicator that you might be likely likely to succeed but it isn't and all be all great things but it's not necessarily the case you know if you look at um say people like Bill Gates or Larry Ellison Steve Jobs these guys didn't graduate from college that's true take a look at these people right that he mentioned Larry Page the founder of Google Bill Gates founder of Microsoft they did not actually graduate from college but watch what he actually says next I think that's important but if you had a chance to hire them of course that would be a good idea whoa Elon you're right about that if I had uh Bill Gates knocking on my door I think I would take him up on his offer so you know just looking just for evidence of exceptional ability looking for evidence for exceptional ability now let's see what he means when he says that of exceptional ability and if there's a track record of exceptional achievement then it's likely that that will continue into the future so Elon looks for a track record of exceptional ability okay so what does that mean for you well what that means for what that might mean for a software developer or somebody who wants to become a full stack developer is stop looking around for I need a piece of paper that's worth sixty thousand dollars I need this that's not what you actually need what you actually need is a solid skill set skills that you could show from your portfolio skills that you could show when you're on that job interview and skills you can use to actually get a job
