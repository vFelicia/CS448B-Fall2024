00:00 - speaking about what are the top laptops
00:02 - that you should be using
00:04 - if you are a software developer so
00:08 - let's jump right into it guys there's
00:10 - gonna be
00:11 - so many different options that you would
00:14 - be
00:14 - you know lucky to use but at the same
00:17 - time
00:17 - i feel like it does depend a lot on what
00:20 - type of
00:21 - outcome you want what kind of objective
00:23 - you want and that's going to be
00:25 - interesting so right now what we're
00:27 - going to do is
00:28 - jump right ahead the best laptops for
00:30 - programming and
00:31 - really guys we are dropping fire content
00:34 - on the daily it's insane we're making
00:37 - crazy builds next week coming up on
00:39 - actually this week on wednesday thursday
00:41 - and friday we're going to be building
00:43 - whatsapp and also amazon and
00:47 - youtube i believe it's not amazon one of
00:49 - those i have to double check it with
00:50 - everything
00:51 - but at the end of the day it's crazy
00:52 - crazy top tech companies that we're
00:54 - helping
00:54 - helping you dissect so that you can
00:57 - build them from the ground
00:58 - up with the mirn stack and sunny and
01:01 - david are going to be teaching you that
01:02 - so make sure to like the button if you
01:04 - guys
01:04 - are really enjoying this type of content
01:06 - also if you guys
01:08 - are enjoying it and you kind of want to
01:09 - keep up with us because we're going
01:10 - daily
01:11 - not stopping for anybody is smash that
01:14 - subscribe button
01:15 - and that like button as well so let's
01:17 - carry over guys
01:19 - you know to go into more details about
01:22 - what type of
01:23 - programming computer you should use
01:24 - let's read a little bit about here
01:27 - yep we already built amazon my wrist
01:29 - nice man people
01:30 - people are are noticing what type of
01:32 - builds we're leaving we're
01:34 - you know putting live for you guys
01:35 - that's amazing
01:37 - and yep so you know the end goal is
01:40 - pretty much what's going to dictate what
01:41 - type of laptop you're going to be using
01:43 - for your career as a software developer
01:46 - let's say
01:46 - let me open up my pointer right here so
01:49 - this is you you are a developer
01:50 - and let's say you want to build i don't
01:52 - know maybe android apps
01:54 - or ios apps so if you're using android
01:57 - apps the cool thing about it is that
01:58 - you can either use windows i used to
02:00 - program
02:01 - for android on windows that was pretty
02:04 - cool but at the same time it was
02:05 - the getting setting up the coding
02:07 - environment on windows was
02:09 - a freaking pain in the butt it was
02:11 - insane but if you do want to do maybe
02:13 - ios development you are going to need a
02:15 - mac so depending what you want to do
02:17 - you're going to need a different
02:17 - computer
02:19 - android you can use both because you can
02:20 - develop android
02:22 - on mac so that's pretty cool so but if
02:24 - you want to do ios development in swift
02:26 - you need a macbook
02:27 - computer because that's the only way
02:29 - that you can actually download
02:31 - swift not swift sorry xcode which is
02:34 - what you use to
02:35 - write in on write swift that's the not
02:38 - the text editor but but the ide
02:40 - if you want to build games you might
02:42 - maybe want to use
02:44 - well you can use different ones i've
02:45 - seen people run run actually
02:47 - what is it called the c-sharp engine
02:50 - unity engine
02:51 - and you can use it either on windows or
02:54 - mac i believe but ultimately this
02:57 - as well you know if you're a gamer
02:59 - you're probably going to want to use
03:00 - windows
03:01 - because we also use those same laptops
03:04 - for other specific things right so
03:06 - it's not just coding and it does affect
03:08 - the experience of coding
03:10 - if you can't let's say play a youtube
03:12 - video or something as simple as that
03:15 - so you know you want to build whether
03:17 - that's windows apps or
03:19 - mac apps then at the same time it's
03:21 - going to you know
03:22 - dictate whether you use windows mac or
03:24 - even ubuntu in that case i know a lot of
03:26 - companies use ubuntu
03:28 - um what are they called the virtual
03:31 - machines
03:32 - instead of their windows just to
03:34 - actually you know
03:35 - make it easier for them to develop in
03:38 - using a windows computer but using the
03:40 - ubuntu operating system so all right
03:43 - guys this is how i'm feeling right now
03:45 - we're going to go into the best laptops
03:47 - that you guys can actually use
03:48 - and remember guys the end goal that you
03:50 - have in mind is going to dictate the
03:52 - type of laptop that you're going to use
03:54 - right you're going to do swift you need
03:56 - mac if you're going to do
03:58 - android you can use windows if you're
04:00 - gonna do anything else
04:01 - i mean you can just use either windows
04:03 - mac or
04:04 - ubuntu but it does depend so going back
04:07 - into this guys
04:08 - one of the most important things in my
04:10 - opinion is just because of the fact that
04:12 - you're gonna be staring at code for a
04:14 - long time and
04:15 - it's it's you know some coders code for
04:17 - about eight hours to
04:19 - 10 to 12 to even more 14 to 16 hours of
04:22 - a day depending on what project has to
04:24 - be you know whether that's
04:27 - it has to be finished it has to be just
04:29 - worked on or
04:31 - you have to co-work or quote or
04:34 - what is it called you know dual coding
04:37 - with somebody else at the same time
04:38 - excuse me so most
04:42 - laptops already come with a 16 by 19
04:44 - screen ratio
04:45 - that's the regular ratios that mac
04:47 - computers use
04:48 - actually so that's something to take
04:51 - into account i normally never see just
04:53 - squared four four three screen ratios
04:56 - but i see this one allow
04:58 - on a lot now popping up because a lot of
05:00 - times
05:01 - i guess we have a laptop but what we do
05:03 - is that we
05:04 - we actually connect an external monitor
05:06 - just like this one and the 21.9 ones are
05:08 - gonna be
05:09 - a little bit more kind of like the lg
05:11 - you know widescreen ones that are maybe
05:14 - the 27 inch the 32 inch and then
05:17 - then even the 34 inch so in my opinion
05:21 - 16 by nine
05:22 - screen ratio is the most important one
05:24 - that you should get and all macs are
05:26 - done with that screen ratio so and yeah
05:28 - jimmy mendez said
05:30 - pier programming yes pair programming is
05:32 - what i was thinking about
05:34 - so thank you so much for that my man
05:36 - people are on top of it i love it
05:37 - how many monitors are recommended i'd
05:39 - say two men at the same time
05:41 - you can have three years or so but i
05:44 - just feel like those are too much
05:46 - maybe maybe three of you have a big
05:47 - setup but if you just want something
05:49 - minimal that actually
05:50 - you know raises your efficiency i say
05:52 - use two monitors instead of
05:54 - just one monitor so the screen size you
05:56 - know talking about monitors right now is
05:58 - going to be very very important i didn't
06:00 - even list
06:01 - anything under 13 inches just because i
06:03 - think it's so hard to look at those
06:04 - screens it's insane like the 11 inch
06:07 - macbook
06:08 - air or the macbooks man they're so
06:11 - annoying to me i
06:12 - i can't even believe they're real
06:14 - computers they look like toys to me
06:15 - but the 13 inch what i like about it is
06:18 - that it's a very very
06:19 - portable you can take it pretty much
06:21 - anywhere it's insane you know like you
06:23 - you actually do feel like it's a laptop
06:26 - that you can take while traveling
06:27 - but other than that you know if you're
06:29 - thinking about
06:30 - the 15-inch i don't think it's much of a
06:33 - huge
06:34 - difference i know that you know you are
06:36 - able to feel the differences between the
06:37 - 13 and 15 because 13 is just so small in
06:40 - my opinion
06:40 - but it's it's also kind of decent but i
06:43 - think like man if you are coding a lot
06:45 - you're not going to
06:45 - want to look at that small small screen
06:48 - so 15 inch to me
06:49 - might be the classical one the most the
06:52 - one that would fit most cases
06:54 - for you either whether that's traveling
06:57 - whether that's
06:58 - you know just in general
07:01 - just just coding somewhere also the the
07:04 - 15 inch
07:05 - is beautiful so that even if you want to
07:07 - make graphics or watch videos or do
07:08 - design like ui
07:09 - ux design it's better than looking at 13
07:13 - inches and in my opinion
07:14 - the 16 16-inch macbook pro is really
07:16 - really good
07:17 - and i just want to say that this video
07:19 - is probably going to be a little bit
07:20 - biased just because i've used
07:22 - all three types of operating systems and
07:24 - i've had experiences using windows i
07:26 - grew up using windows then i switched to
07:27 - mac
07:28 - and i grew up also using ubuntu because
07:30 - i would have a dual boot
07:31 - with ubuntu and windows and it's cool
07:34 - and everything so i will dive a little
07:35 - bit deeper into that
07:36 - as the video goes along so you know one
07:38 - of the one
07:39 - one of the things that i did want to say
07:40 - is 15 inch is the preferred one for most
07:42 - people and 16 inch is kind of perfect
07:44 - in my opinion because the bigger the
07:46 - better screen wise at least
07:48 - so off the bat we're going to talk about
07:50 - ram
07:51 - i'm seeing a lot of these laptop videos
07:54 - where people talk about ram not being so
07:56 - important because of code
07:57 - ram is the most important thing if you
07:59 - want to open up more than one
08:01 - you know softwares or programs at the
08:03 - same time
08:04 - man what are you saying bro like
08:07 - i i even get mad to be honest with you
08:09 - because
08:11 - it doesn't mean that just because code
08:13 - is so lightweight because it's text
08:15 - doesn't mean that you don't need that
08:17 - much ram there's also
08:19 - you know fun being thrown around about a
08:21 - few ides that just eat up all your ram
08:23 - but
08:24 - dude google chrome eats up all your ram
08:26 - so
08:27 - if you're programming for a living that
08:29 - pretty much means that you're on your
08:30 - computer
08:31 - most of the day and you know going back
08:34 - to ram
08:35 - if you cannot use your computer to
08:37 - entertain yourself whether that's maybe
08:39 - netflix if you want to watch netflix
08:40 - every so often
08:41 - or even youtube or maybe you're like oh
08:43 - no i'm too i'm way too productive for
08:45 - that
08:45 - for that i don't want to even do youtube
08:47 - then whatever you're using man pinterest
08:49 - whatever you're using dribble
08:50 - for inspiration for your design envato
08:53 - and button
08:54 - anything like that it's going to be you
08:56 - know affected by the size of your ram
08:58 - so right here i did a little bit of an
09:00 - explanation of the ddr
09:02 - ramps so right now ddr and ddr2 are not
09:05 - even really used
09:06 - all we're using right now on the more
09:08 - modern computers is going to be ddr3 and
09:10 - ddr4
09:11 - but now even ddr5 is out and i believe
09:14 - ddr6 is out and the
09:16 - the faster the newer the ram is the
09:18 - faster it's going to be
09:20 - really so make sure that if you do buy a
09:22 - computer right now make sure that it
09:23 - is at least ddr4 and up
09:26 - because it's gonna affect everything
09:28 - let's say you had let's say you're just
09:30 - you know coding in
09:32 - your visual studio code right and then
09:34 - you got maybe dribbled open
09:36 - up as inspiration because you're trying
09:37 - to you know copy a design or something
09:39 - like that maybe you're using
09:40 - the inspect tool in a google chrome
09:44 - you know web page so you're you have
09:46 - like five
09:47 - google chrome tabs open that is already
09:50 - eating up your ram
09:51 - a lot so if you have less than eight
09:54 - gigabytes of ram
09:55 - that that is just gonna kill you i
09:57 - wouldn't recommend
09:58 - anybody that is doing programming to
10:00 - have less than eight gigabytes of ram
10:02 - i'd say eight gigabytes of ram is going
10:05 - to be
10:06 - the very very least that you can have
10:08 - just because i mean
10:10 - i see it and and and i see the
10:12 - differences and it's insane so right
10:13 - here i put a little bit of the
10:14 - difference
10:15 - i'd say 16 gigabytes is really ideal in
10:18 - my own opinion
10:19 - so you know going back to ram right here
10:21 - you can see the differences
10:23 - in speed between 8 gigabytes ram and 16
10:25 - gigabytes rams
10:26 - so off the bat you can see that you know
10:29 - the bigger the bar is the more time it
10:32 - takes to load
10:33 - so here is an example of the gray one is
10:36 - going to be
10:37 - 8 gigabytes ram and then the green one
10:40 - is going to be
10:41 - 16 gigabytes ram so lowest hd
10:46 - with um so they're they're actually
10:48 - testing hard drives
10:50 - with with ssds right so this is the ram
10:54 - with the lowest hard drive
10:55 - option and ssd is better with that
10:58 - sorry uh 16 gigabytes is better with
11:01 - that hdd
11:02 - hard drive so you can see the same here
11:05 - even if you have this lowest
11:06 - ssd if you have if you have 16 gigabytes
11:09 - of ram this is how fast it's going to
11:11 - load
11:11 - if you have an ultra high you know hdd
11:14 - which is a hard drive
11:15 - then you can see here that the eight
11:18 - gigabytes is actually going to be faster
11:20 - in the 16 gigabytes wow this is
11:22 - interesting so ultra
11:23 - hd these are actually popping up a lot
11:26 - and they're going to be
11:27 - pretty pretty new so gaming hard drive
11:29 - settings ultra hdd at 16 crashed
11:32 - changed high texture to low texture so
11:35 - using
11:35 - ultra hdds and ssds apparently the
11:39 - the actual difference is not that huge
11:41 - but if you're using
11:43 - lowest or mid tier ssds and hdds
11:46 - then it's it's just apparent i mean i
11:48 - honestly believe that even here
11:50 - just because of the fact that 16
11:52 - gigabytes of ram you can
11:54 - have more random access memory to open
11:57 - up more programs
11:58 - just by nature it's going to be faster
12:00 - so i'm not completely sure
12:01 - about these specific experiments right
12:03 - here but all in all
12:04 - you can see that 16 gigabytes is going
12:06 - to be way faster than 18 gigabytes
12:08 - this is an example right here too of the
12:10 - difference between ddr4 and ddr5
12:13 - so even though they're not so many years
12:14 - apart it's going to be kind of crazy to
12:16 - know that
12:17 - ddr5 is almost what is this 15
12:21 - almost 10 10 gigabytes faster
12:25 - than the ddr4 if you're using the 1.3
12:29 - 1.36 x type of of hard drive right
12:32 - so this is the speed this should be
12:35 - megabits
12:36 - if i'm not mistaken or gigahertz sorry
12:38 - and 1.87
12:40 - the ddr5 is about still this is 15 this
12:43 - is almost 30. so this is almost
12:45 - double as fast ddr4 versus ddr5
12:49 - so like i said you know the faster
12:51 - models of
12:52 - of ram are going to be the ones that
12:55 - you're going to want to go with
12:56 - just because if you're still using ddr3
12:58 - right now
12:59 - versus the laptops that are using ddr5
13:02 - the thing is that software gets
13:04 - updated really fast and the newer that
13:07 - it is
13:08 - the heavier that it's going to be on
13:10 - your actual machine
13:12 - so make sure to get something that's
13:13 - kind of time proof okay so
13:15 - i know that maybe the ddr3 rams are
13:18 - going to be
13:18 - maybe you can get a 16 gigabyte ddr3 i
13:21 - would still advise you to get maybe a
13:23 - 80 gigabyte ram with a ddr5 and that
13:26 - would be
13:26 - better for you actually in that opinion
13:28 - in my opinion
13:29 - so you know that's a little bit about
13:31 - rams let me see what you guys are
13:33 - doing here so how much ram is needed to
13:37 - do all stuff fluently abinav
13:39 - singh asked and in my opinion
13:43 - man let me actually pop this comment
13:45 - here
13:46 - so i think it's uh
13:49 - let's get it from this screen
13:53 - and put it i actually cannot pull it
13:57 - but let me see it says abinav singh so
14:00 - i think to do stuff fluently on the
14:02 - computer at least you need 16 gigabytes
14:04 - of ram if not
14:05 - man it's just gonna take you so much
14:08 - more time your computer is going to get
14:09 - fro

Cleaned transcript:

speaking about what are the top laptops that you should be using if you are a software developer so let's jump right into it guys there's gonna be so many different options that you would be you know lucky to use but at the same time i feel like it does depend a lot on what type of outcome you want what kind of objective you want and that's going to be interesting so right now what we're going to do is jump right ahead the best laptops for programming and really guys we are dropping fire content on the daily it's insane we're making crazy builds next week coming up on actually this week on wednesday thursday and friday we're going to be building whatsapp and also amazon and youtube i believe it's not amazon one of those i have to double check it with everything but at the end of the day it's crazy crazy top tech companies that we're helping helping you dissect so that you can build them from the ground up with the mirn stack and sunny and david are going to be teaching you that so make sure to like the button if you guys are really enjoying this type of content also if you guys are enjoying it and you kind of want to keep up with us because we're going daily not stopping for anybody is smash that subscribe button and that like button as well so let's carry over guys you know to go into more details about what type of programming computer you should use let's read a little bit about here yep we already built amazon my wrist nice man people people are are noticing what type of builds we're leaving we're you know putting live for you guys that's amazing and yep so you know the end goal is pretty much what's going to dictate what type of laptop you're going to be using for your career as a software developer let's say let me open up my pointer right here so this is you you are a developer and let's say you want to build i don't know maybe android apps or ios apps so if you're using android apps the cool thing about it is that you can either use windows i used to program for android on windows that was pretty cool but at the same time it was the getting setting up the coding environment on windows was a freaking pain in the butt it was insane but if you do want to do maybe ios development you are going to need a mac so depending what you want to do you're going to need a different computer android you can use both because you can develop android on mac so that's pretty cool so but if you want to do ios development in swift you need a macbook computer because that's the only way that you can actually download swift not swift sorry xcode which is what you use to write in on write swift that's the not the text editor but but the ide if you want to build games you might maybe want to use well you can use different ones i've seen people run run actually what is it called the csharp engine unity engine and you can use it either on windows or mac i believe but ultimately this as well you know if you're a gamer you're probably going to want to use windows because we also use those same laptops for other specific things right so it's not just coding and it does affect the experience of coding if you can't let's say play a youtube video or something as simple as that so you know you want to build whether that's windows apps or mac apps then at the same time it's going to you know dictate whether you use windows mac or even ubuntu in that case i know a lot of companies use ubuntu um what are they called the virtual machines instead of their windows just to actually you know make it easier for them to develop in using a windows computer but using the ubuntu operating system so all right guys this is how i'm feeling right now we're going to go into the best laptops that you guys can actually use and remember guys the end goal that you have in mind is going to dictate the type of laptop that you're going to use right you're going to do swift you need mac if you're going to do android you can use windows if you're gonna do anything else i mean you can just use either windows mac or ubuntu but it does depend so going back into this guys one of the most important things in my opinion is just because of the fact that you're gonna be staring at code for a long time and it's it's you know some coders code for about eight hours to 10 to 12 to even more 14 to 16 hours of a day depending on what project has to be you know whether that's it has to be finished it has to be just worked on or you have to cowork or quote or what is it called you know dual coding with somebody else at the same time excuse me so most laptops already come with a 16 by 19 screen ratio that's the regular ratios that mac computers use actually so that's something to take into account i normally never see just squared four four three screen ratios but i see this one allow on a lot now popping up because a lot of times i guess we have a laptop but what we do is that we we actually connect an external monitor just like this one and the 21.9 ones are gonna be a little bit more kind of like the lg you know widescreen ones that are maybe the 27 inch the 32 inch and then then even the 34 inch so in my opinion 16 by nine screen ratio is the most important one that you should get and all macs are done with that screen ratio so and yeah jimmy mendez said pier programming yes pair programming is what i was thinking about so thank you so much for that my man people are on top of it i love it how many monitors are recommended i'd say two men at the same time you can have three years or so but i just feel like those are too much maybe maybe three of you have a big setup but if you just want something minimal that actually you know raises your efficiency i say use two monitors instead of just one monitor so the screen size you know talking about monitors right now is going to be very very important i didn't even list anything under 13 inches just because i think it's so hard to look at those screens it's insane like the 11 inch macbook air or the macbooks man they're so annoying to me i i can't even believe they're real computers they look like toys to me but the 13 inch what i like about it is that it's a very very portable you can take it pretty much anywhere it's insane you know like you you actually do feel like it's a laptop that you can take while traveling but other than that you know if you're thinking about the 15inch i don't think it's much of a huge difference i know that you know you are able to feel the differences between the 13 and 15 because 13 is just so small in my opinion but it's it's also kind of decent but i think like man if you are coding a lot you're not going to want to look at that small small screen so 15 inch to me might be the classical one the most the one that would fit most cases for you either whether that's traveling whether that's you know just in general just just coding somewhere also the the 15 inch is beautiful so that even if you want to make graphics or watch videos or do design like ui ux design it's better than looking at 13 inches and in my opinion the 16 16inch macbook pro is really really good and i just want to say that this video is probably going to be a little bit biased just because i've used all three types of operating systems and i've had experiences using windows i grew up using windows then i switched to mac and i grew up also using ubuntu because i would have a dual boot with ubuntu and windows and it's cool and everything so i will dive a little bit deeper into that as the video goes along so you know one of the one one of the things that i did want to say is 15 inch is the preferred one for most people and 16 inch is kind of perfect in my opinion because the bigger the better screen wise at least so off the bat we're going to talk about ram i'm seeing a lot of these laptop videos where people talk about ram not being so important because of code ram is the most important thing if you want to open up more than one you know softwares or programs at the same time man what are you saying bro like i i even get mad to be honest with you because it doesn't mean that just because code is so lightweight because it's text doesn't mean that you don't need that much ram there's also you know fun being thrown around about a few ides that just eat up all your ram but dude google chrome eats up all your ram so if you're programming for a living that pretty much means that you're on your computer most of the day and you know going back to ram if you cannot use your computer to entertain yourself whether that's maybe netflix if you want to watch netflix every so often or even youtube or maybe you're like oh no i'm too i'm way too productive for that for that i don't want to even do youtube then whatever you're using man pinterest whatever you're using dribble for inspiration for your design envato and button anything like that it's going to be you know affected by the size of your ram so right here i did a little bit of an explanation of the ddr ramps so right now ddr and ddr2 are not even really used all we're using right now on the more modern computers is going to be ddr3 and ddr4 but now even ddr5 is out and i believe ddr6 is out and the the faster the newer the ram is the faster it's going to be really so make sure that if you do buy a computer right now make sure that it is at least ddr4 and up because it's gonna affect everything let's say you had let's say you're just you know coding in your visual studio code right and then you got maybe dribbled open up as inspiration because you're trying to you know copy a design or something like that maybe you're using the inspect tool in a google chrome you know web page so you're you have like five google chrome tabs open that is already eating up your ram a lot so if you have less than eight gigabytes of ram that that is just gonna kill you i wouldn't recommend anybody that is doing programming to have less than eight gigabytes of ram i'd say eight gigabytes of ram is going to be the very very least that you can have just because i mean i see it and and and i see the differences and it's insane so right here i put a little bit of the difference i'd say 16 gigabytes is really ideal in my own opinion so you know going back to ram right here you can see the differences in speed between 8 gigabytes ram and 16 gigabytes rams so off the bat you can see that you know the bigger the bar is the more time it takes to load so here is an example of the gray one is going to be 8 gigabytes ram and then the green one is going to be 16 gigabytes ram so lowest hd with um so they're they're actually testing hard drives with with ssds right so this is the ram with the lowest hard drive option and ssd is better with that sorry uh 16 gigabytes is better with that hdd hard drive so you can see the same here even if you have this lowest ssd if you have if you have 16 gigabytes of ram this is how fast it's going to load if you have an ultra high you know hdd which is a hard drive then you can see here that the eight gigabytes is actually going to be faster in the 16 gigabytes wow this is interesting so ultra hd these are actually popping up a lot and they're going to be pretty pretty new so gaming hard drive settings ultra hdd at 16 crashed changed high texture to low texture so using ultra hdds and ssds apparently the the actual difference is not that huge but if you're using lowest or mid tier ssds and hdds then it's it's just apparent i mean i honestly believe that even here just because of the fact that 16 gigabytes of ram you can have more random access memory to open up more programs just by nature it's going to be faster so i'm not completely sure about these specific experiments right here but all in all you can see that 16 gigabytes is going to be way faster than 18 gigabytes this is an example right here too of the difference between ddr4 and ddr5 so even though they're not so many years apart it's going to be kind of crazy to know that ddr5 is almost what is this 15 almost 10 10 gigabytes faster than the ddr4 if you're using the 1.3 1.36 x type of of hard drive right so this is the speed this should be megabits if i'm not mistaken or gigahertz sorry and 1.87 the ddr5 is about still this is 15 this is almost 30. so this is almost double as fast ddr4 versus ddr5 so like i said you know the faster models of of ram are going to be the ones that you're going to want to go with just because if you're still using ddr3 right now versus the laptops that are using ddr5 the thing is that software gets updated really fast and the newer that it is the heavier that it's going to be on your actual machine so make sure to get something that's kind of time proof okay so i know that maybe the ddr3 rams are going to be maybe you can get a 16 gigabyte ddr3 i would still advise you to get maybe a 80 gigabyte ram with a ddr5 and that would be better for you actually in that opinion in my opinion so you know that's a little bit about rams let me see what you guys are doing here so how much ram is needed to do all stuff fluently abinav singh asked and in my opinion man let me actually pop this comment here so i think it's uh let's get it from this screen and put it i actually cannot pull it but let me see it says abinav singh so i think to do stuff fluently on the computer at least you need 16 gigabytes of ram if not man it's just gonna take you so much more time your computer is going to get fro
