00:09 - the top
00:09 - tech companies right now in the world
00:12 - and we're showing you
00:13 - how to build them so it's insane you
00:16 - know we got facebook for you
00:18 - sunny's going to teach you a little bit
00:19 - more about what's going on in the back
00:20 - and the
00:21 - you know everything in the back scenes
00:23 - so tell me a little bit about that sonny
00:26 - yeah so today guys we have a huge build
00:28 - for you guys so we actually went ahead
00:30 - and built the facebook clone so this
00:33 - is the actual facebook phone that we
00:34 - went ahead and built so let's go ahead
00:36 - and look at the actual facebook
00:38 - so this is the actual facebook that uh
00:40 - this actually built in react so
00:42 - obviously facebook are the creators of
00:43 - react
00:44 - they went ahead and rebooked their
00:45 - entire website with um
00:47 - with react so um here you go here's the
00:50 - actual facebook build
00:51 - and you've got the header the sidebar
00:53 - the middle feed and these stories and
00:55 - we went ahead and rebuilt it in a
00:57 - similar fashion
00:58 - and frankie what do you think of this
01:00 - build man it is insane one of the best
01:03 - builds we've seen to date
01:05 - sunny said he busted it out in about
01:07 - three hours and a half of intense
01:09 - work so i mean i told them that's
01:11 - probably like six to seven hours of
01:13 - somebody else's time but you guys know
01:15 - this is papa react here so
01:17 - he's bringing you great builds so that
01:19 - you can put them on your portfolio and
01:20 - actually
01:21 - learn everything that goes behind them
01:22 - as well exactly guys we've done all this
01:25 - for you guys
01:26 - and we are super pumped and i'm so happy

01:29 - well so
01:30 - another killer session with frankie
01:32 - let's go ahead and d
01:33 - like break down the app a little bit so
01:35 - we've got uh you can see
01:36 - over here we've got the nice little sort
01:39 - of header component at the top
01:41 - we went ahead and built that we've got a
01:42 - nice little sidebar and bear in mind
01:44 - guys this is all responsive
01:46 - we have a lovely little stories which is
01:48 - actually got a very nice little hover
01:50 - functionality you guys can see
01:51 - and if we go ahead and type in here so
01:53 - let's go ahead and say hey guys
01:55 - let's go ahead and say hey guys what's
01:57 - going on what's going on and i go ahead
01:59 - and hit enter
02:00 - boom we've got nice little animations
02:02 - there too which is
02:03 - really really clean really really nice
02:06 - and we can also support images here guys
02:08 - so i'm going to go ahead and quickly
02:09 - find an image
02:10 - so let's go ahead and quickly find a
02:12 - programming image one second guys
02:15 - let's go ahead and find an image and
02:17 - let's see
02:18 - if the image uploading also works and
02:21 - this is
02:21 - the demo gods against us right now so
02:23 - hopefully this this should work
02:25 - but if we go ahead and write a message
02:26 - like what's up guys
02:28 - what's up guys and then i go ahead and
02:30 - drop an image url over here and i hit
02:32 - enter
02:33 - boom check that out guys even supports
02:36 - images
02:37 - so that's super fast yeah super fast no
02:39 - response
02:40 - no um uh refresh you've got some nice ui
02:43 - elements at the top
02:45 - and you've got this lovely little
02:46 - sidebar here which is actually connected
02:47 - to the clever programmer page this is
02:49 - the actual facebook feed pulling in
02:51 - and guys we took it another step further
02:54 - and we went ahead and did something
02:56 - extra for you guys so we actually went
02:58 - ahead
02:58 - and added authentication to this build
03:02 - so
03:02 - if we refresh the page you can see we've
03:04 - got this nice facebook login page so if
03:06 - we go ahead and click that
03:07 - it will actually pop up and we're using
03:09 - google authentication to handle it so
03:11 - let's go ahead and log into my
03:13 - gmail account so it will actually go
03:15 - ahead log into google
03:16 - and boom we actually pause our
03:18 - information uses it in a bunch of
03:20 - different places as you can see
03:21 - and that's it guys we're going to be
03:23 - building this today let us know if
03:25 - you're pumped and drop a thumbs up if
03:27 - you are excited for this
03:29 - damn this is beautiful man scroll down a
03:31 - little bit i see
03:32 - that nas drop the comment and stuff
03:34 - right because hey
03:35 - people some of the people in the in the
03:38 - actual team were testing out this app
03:40 - you know to make sure that it does work
03:41 - and it has functionalities
03:43 - just like someone just showed you but
03:45 - yeah we were having some fun with that

03:50 - dope dudes
03:51 - so sonny what are gonna be the tech
03:53 - everything tech stack all the things
03:55 - that we're gonna use for this build
03:56 - yeah good question frankie so let's go
03:58 - ahead and jump in and let's break down
04:00 - this build in terms of what tech we're
04:01 - going to be using
04:02 - so let's go ahead ahead and have a look
04:04 - so we have
04:05 - react oh damn bro
04:12 - donation thank you frank just dropped a
04:14 - tech programmer
04:15 - no today's my birthday wow happy
04:18 - birthday man
04:18 - happy birthday dude yeah thank you so
04:22 - much
04:22 - that's it guys we got the energy flying
04:24 - and we just hit 680
04:27 - concurrent viewers at the moment so
04:29 - that's insane we love and appreciate you
04:31 - guys and we are super pumped to be here
04:32 - today
04:33 - so let's carry on with this breakdown
04:34 - guys so we have this is the tech that is
04:36 - going to be used in today's
04:38 - facebook clone build so we have react
04:40 - obviously powering everything so react
04:42 - the irony here is react was built by
04:44 - facebook and we are now building a
04:46 - facebook group
04:47 - with react so pretty cool we're going to
04:49 - be using react hooks so we're going to
04:51 - keep everything up today
04:52 - hey somebody's actually jumped in here
04:54 - guys please keep this clean
04:56 - otherwise i'm gonna have to check take
04:57 - it off the screen um so make sure you
04:59 - keep this thing
04:59 - clean but you guys this shows you it's a
05:01 - real-time functionality going on
05:03 - um so we've got the react context api so
05:05 - if anyone's wanting to learn
05:07 - the redux pattern then make sure you
05:09 - stick around because we will be showing
05:10 - you how to use the react context api
05:12 - and in particular we're going to be
05:13 - capturing the user when they log in with
05:16 - that
05:16 - uh with that api so that's going to be
05:18 - cool also material ui is going to be
05:20 - used to go ahead and capture
05:22 - all of these so all of these icons that
05:24 - you see over here
05:25 - hey frankie check this out we've got
05:27 - people dropping
05:28 - uh things right in there nice
05:31 - so we've got all of these icons all of
05:33 - these different elements like these
05:35 - avatars we use
05:36 - material ui to go ahead and power that
05:38 - we're going to be using flexbox to make
05:39 - things very responsive
05:41 - to get everything in this real-time
05:43 - fashion we are going to be using
05:45 - the firestore database which is a
05:48 - real-time database provided by
05:49 - firebase and we're also going to be
05:51 - using firebase hosting which is how i
05:53 - actually got this thing deployed
05:54 - so that's awesome uh and yeah and we're
05:57 - going to be using google's
05:58 - authentication to go ahead and power the
06:00 - entire thing
06:01 - so that's pretty exciting we just got
06:03 - another donation
06:04 - exactly what i was going to say pablo
06:06 - bless thank you so much man
06:08 - he says thank you guys so much you are
06:10 - the best
06:11 - nice awesome thank you so much i know
06:13 - that a lot of people ask actually ask
06:14 - about authentication it's a great
06:16 - thing to actually add to your portfolio
06:18 - you know a lot of companies want to know
06:19 - that you're able to make authentication
06:21 - systems so
06:22 - we got you exactly we got you yeah we
06:25 - got some nice
06:26 - funny little gifts being popped in right
06:29 - here
06:29 - nice also guys actually we also added
06:32 - one more thing we added a little bonus
06:34 - for you guys we added a react
06:35 - flip move and what this does is i think
06:38 - it's called flip move it gives you that
06:39 - nice animation so if i go ahead oh so
06:41 - frank just typed in if i go ahead and
06:43 - say yo
06:45 - like as soon as i hit enter here guys
06:46 - you see how it pops in all smooth

06:50 - works super clean
06:52 - uh so we're gonna go ahead and show you
06:53 - guys frankie what'd you say should we
06:54 - jump into this build
06:56 - let's go right ahead i'm just taking an
06:58 - instagram story right now
06:59 - make sure to tag us guys if you're
07:01 - enjoying this build our instagram

07:16 - more than a number when we see you guys
07:18 - go ahead and involve us like that so
07:20 - nice let's go ahead and start this build
07:22 - frankie
07:23 - so let's go nice let's do it so
07:27 - the first thing someone
07:30 - i think nice dude i'm not the only one
07:33 - getting a clean fade so
07:34 - gonna be some exciting stuff like that
07:37 - exactly
07:38 - so right so with that said guys we're
07:41 - gonna actually go ahead and i'm going to
07:43 - just
07:44 - hide this window just for now in case
07:46 - something doji pops up
07:47 - so right now guys what you want to do is
07:49 - we're going to open up our terminal
07:51 - and the first thing that we're going to
07:52 - do is go ahead and use mpx
07:55 - create react app so create react app
07:58 - and we're going to call the app let's
07:59 - just call it the facebook clone so fb
08:01 - clone
08:02 - right now that's going to go ahead and
08:04 - use the create react app tool to go
08:06 - ahead and set up a
08:07 - react starter template so this is what
08:09 - we use in every single one of our builds
08:11 - and it's going to allow you to get
08:12 - started off in a very nice and quick way
08:15 - while that happens let's go ahead and
08:17 - donation by the show
08:18 - while that happens thank you so much man
08:22 - we see all you guys we remember all you
08:24 - guys so thank you for being here for
08:25 - multiple streams michelle
08:27 - i know that's a familiar face thank you
08:28 - man nice i love seeing people like that
08:31 - you know who come back to the thing
08:32 - that's not that's nice dude
08:34 - um awesome let's go ahead and actually
08:36 - check
08:37 - someone got sonny is a bot who makes
08:38 - these amazing bills daily and never gets
08:40 - tired
08:41 - guys you do get tired you know but it's
08:44 - awesome we do this for you guys and we
08:46 - love it
08:46 - right frankie yep after practice and
08:49 - practice it just ingrains in you and
08:50 - this is why sonny is such a master with
08:52 - react
08:52 - and him doing these builds daily is just
08:55 - building up his skill set even more and
08:57 - more so
08:58 - imagine in the future guys exactly guys
09:00 - and that's what we're trying to
09:01 - show you guys even if you get stuck or
09:03 - you feel like it's a bit tricky
09:04 - just go ahead and build it alongside us
09:06 - and pattern recognition
09:08 - with every video you're going to get a
09:09 - little bit better right
09:11 - so let's go ahead and actually set up
09:13 - firebase while we wait for this so
09:15 - firebase is a suite of tools provided by
09:18 - google
09:19 - and what can you do with firebase
09:20 - frankie so firebase lets you
09:23 - host all the data that you want inside
09:25 - of google's
09:26 - is it firestore yeah it's all google's
09:29 - ecosystem
09:30 - so the cool thing about it is that you
09:31 - don't need a sql database to run all
09:33 - these things
09:34 - and if you're doing anything you know
09:35 - kind of like personal projects
09:37 - firebase has has you handled you don't
09:39 - need more than that honestly
09:41 - exactly so with firebase you can have a
09:43 - real-time database
09:44 - you can have a uh you can host the app
09:47 - you can do a bunch of machine learning
09:48 - cool stuff
09:49 - and things like that with it so it's
09:50 - basically just a set of tools that we're
09:52 - going to use but we're actually going to
09:53 - be using the database
09:54 - and the hosting capabilities so the
09:56 - first thing you do is click on create a
09:58 - project and go inside and type in let's
10:00 - just type in facebook
10:02 - clone like this go ahead and click
10:05 - continue
10:06 - and then you want to click on so we're
10:07 - actually going to enable google
10:09 - analytics for this project let's go
10:10 - ahead and do
10:11 - clever programmer you don't need to
10:12 - enable google analytics as an extra step
10:15 - frankly we just hit over 820
10:18 - concurrent viewers wow let's get that to
10:21 - 1 000 guys thank you all for being here
10:23 - this is awesome man
10:24 - can i see that michael jones just
10:26 - dropped on the comments he says
10:28 - tomorrow build a world clone with react
10:31 - for beginners
10:32 - hey nice somebody like that after all of
10:36 - this
10:37 - somebody just says i have maxed out my
10:39 - firebase well gmail accounts are free
10:41 - guys
10:41 - so what i'm going to say is create
10:44 - another gmail account and add another
10:46 - set of apps to that
10:48 - um there we go awesome right so
10:51 - there we have it guys on the left side
10:53 - you can see down here where it says
10:55 - cd uh firebase clone it says happy
10:57 - hacking so once you get that message
10:59 - very important step you want to make
11:01 - sure you cd into the correct folder
11:03 - uh we're using oh my zsh that's why it
11:05 - looks a little bit different so if
11:06 - you're not using that i recommend you go
11:08 - ahead and check it out
11:09 - um so go ahead and do that and then with
11:12 - that said guys we're going to go ahead
11:14 - and do mpm start and mpm start will go
11:17 - ahead and spin up the app for us on
11:19 - localhost 3000 so if you've done this
11:22 - correctly and everything was done
11:23 - in a nice oh damn frankie check out the
11:27 - donation we just drove
11:29 - amazing kenny hank thank you so much man
11:32 - hi guys
11:33 - awesome work there's there's a way to
11:35 - get the source code after every session
11:38 - yep so we're gonna be dropping the
11:40 - github repository on the description
11:42 - below after the actual builds exactly
11:45 - stay tuned for that we'll be dropping it
11:47 - in the and the link will be in the
11:48 - description afterwards
11:49 - we've got another one from vinayak and
11:52 - nirvani
11:52 - he didn't leave a message he just
11:54 - dropped two pounds thank you so much
11:55 - dude

12:04 - bosses love it thank you guys we
12:06 - appreciate it
12:07 - nice thank you guys awesome
12:10 - uh somebody goes i hope clever
12:11 - programmer will clone up work soon yeah
12:13 - we will be probably we can clone that
12:15 - that'll be that'll be fun
12:17 - yeah nice right so now guys
12:20 - what we're gonna do is we have if you
12:22 - get to this screen then it's a very good
12:24 - starting point right
12:25 - so with that said you want to go inside
12:27 - your folders you will get see this new
12:29 - folder at the top stitch which says
12:30 - facebook clone
12:31 - click inside of source and we want to do
12:33 - a clean up process so this
12:35 - is what we do in every at the start of
12:37 - every single build
12:38 - and what we do is we go ahead and delete
12:40 - the app.test.js
12:41 - delete the logo.svg and delete the setup
12:43 - test.js
12:44 - you want to go ahead and get rid of
12:46 - those files because we don't actually
12:47 - need those files
12:48 - so let's go ahead and do that
12:52 - move to trash done let's go ahead and
12:54 - close this one for now as well actually
12:56 - we can save this and close it there we
12:58 - go
12:59 - and then why is that why is that done
13:00 - all the time in the beginning of the
13:02 - builds
13:03 - why do we yes yeah because as you guys
13:05 - know i'm a super beginner in coding
13:07 - so i'm gonna try to you know ask a few
13:09 - questions here from a beginner's
13:10 - standpoint
13:10 - hopefully sonny can answer them and give
13:12 - you guys a little bit of insights with
13:13 - that
13:14 - yeah good question so the reason why we
13:16 - do that is because we don't actually
13:18 - want anything on our on our build
13:20 - initially we want like a clean
13:22 - like canvas imagine you're about to
13:23 - paint something you don't want anything
13:25 - on your canvas right you want it to be
13:26 - completely
13:27 - clean so that's why we go ahead and
13:29 - delete those files and then we
13:31 - actually want to go here delete this and
13:33 - do like a h1 which says
13:35 - let's build the facebook clone
13:38 - the facebook clone and let's go ahead
13:41 - and change this to an a because we will
13:43 - be using something called the bem
13:45 - naming convention so this is a css
13:48 - naming convention
13:49 - if you guys don't know what this is i
13:50 - recommend you learn it because we do
13:52 - this in every build and it helps you
13:53 - build your apps and scale up
13:55 - so we're going to also delete the logo
13:57 - save the file and with that said you
13:59 - should see
14:00 - the following so now if we make this
14:03 - full screen you can see i've because
14:06 - initially if it would be like this right
14:08 - it would have kept away and it's this
14:09 - would be centered
14:10 - so what you want to do is two steps you
14:11 - want to make this a lowercase a
14:13 - then you also want to go over to app.css
14:16 - and what we like to do guys is we want
14:17 - to get rid of all of the styling
14:19 - right so app.css go ahead and delete
14:22 - everything
14:22 - so delete everything inside of app.css
14:25 - open up your files again and go to
14:27 - index.css and can you guys see this like
14:30 - imaginary sort of spacing that they add
14:34 - at the top so there's like this
14:35 - this is margin at the top right so this
14:37 - margin over here we want to get rid of
14:39 - that
14:39 - so what we're going to do to get rid of
14:41 - that is we're going to go here and we're
14:43 - going to say
14:45 - exclamation um sorry asterix and then
14:47 - we're going to say margin
14:49 - 0. and this will make sure that we don't
14:52 - see any invisible sort of
14:54 - any invisible sort of margins being
14:57 - added to
14:58 - our build so with that said
15:01 - we actually go ahead and get a clean
15:03 - slate we get a clean canvas
15:05 - and this is going to be the start point
15:07 - of the app so if you reach this point
15:09 - that is awesome guys
15:12 - you can give yourselves a a nice pat on
15:14 - the back frankie just shut off the air
15:16 - horns
15:16 - because because nice
15:20 - we have 800 people guys 800 people
15:22 - watching this is awesome
15:24 - amazing yeah now we're up to 658 likes
15:28 - thank you guys so much about to reach
15:30 - the 700
15:31 - mark please leave a thumbs up if you
15:33 - guys are enjoying this build
15:34 - we love you yeah exactly all we ask guys
15:36 - is you smash the thumbs up if you're
15:38 - excited for today's build
15:40 - nice um so the first step we're also
15:42 - going to do is we just set up firebase
15:44 - right so we did this whole step right
15:46 - here
15:46 - we're going to click on continue wait
15:48 - until this loads up and then you want to
15:50 - click this little web icon over here so
15:52 - you want to click that
15:53 - type in the facebook clone and you also
15:57 - want to tick this little
15:58 - option right here click on register app
16:00 - and then
16:01 - once you get to this point you can
16:04 - pretty much go ahead and click
16:05 - on next we don't need to worry about
16:06 - that step here we will need this but we
16:09 - will do this afterwards
16:10 - and then we can click continue to
16:12 - console now
16:14 - once that's done guys you want to go to
16:15 - this little cog over here
16:17 - click on project settings and then
16:19 - scroll down
16:20 - to here where it says firebase sdk
16:23 - snippet click on the config
16:25 - so click on this button right here and
16:27 - then you basically want to grab this
16:28 - config over here
16:29 - so you want to click this little copy
16:31 - button so to copy it or you can just
16:33 - grab it like this and
16:34 - command c and then you want to basically
16:36 - go ahead and do the following so
16:38 - go ahead in your source folder and
16:41 - create a
16:42 - file called firebase.js
16:45 - right and what i want you guys to do is
16:47 - just go ahead and paste
16:48 - that config inside of there and the
16:51 - reason
16:52 - being is because we are going to be
16:54 - needing this file and this config file
16:56 - to actually go ahead
16:58 - and set everything up later on so i
17:00 - actually saw a good question that i
17:01 - wanted to pin
17:03 - um it was actually from somebody called
17:05 - code with ven he says sonny please i got
17:07 - a question is it safe to put your
17:08 - firebase config on the front end so he's
17:10 - actually talking about this config right
17:12 - here
17:13 - guys it's actually a very good question
17:15 - and it is safe
17:16 - it is safe i know we're used to thinking
17:18 - about like oh you should hide your
17:19 - config but
17:20 - it's completely safe to do it firebase
17:22 - do you have some protective security
17:24 - measures
17:24 - in place so it's actually safe to go
17:26 - ahead and share that that's why we're
17:27 - not hiding it
17:29 - um oh just got a donation theta 45
17:32 - finance
17:33 - damn beautiful man he says can't believe
17:35 - this is free wish i had this when i was
17:37 - younger
17:38 - i i wish the same thing man you know
17:40 - that's really why we're making these
17:41 - builds you know even sunny even
17:43 - qazi says this say this all the time you
17:45 - know we wish this was out
17:47 - for us when we were younger so that's
17:48 - really the reason why we're doing it for
17:50 - you guys now
17:51 - yeah exactly i know and it's so true
17:53 - like guys i
17:54 - wish wish there was like this level of
17:57 - tutorials on the internet when i was
17:59 - learning to code and like
18:00 - frankie can vouch for me as well like
18:01 - it's it's just like a game changer in
18:03 - terms of space
18:04 - and it's just boring watching like you
18:06 - know reading those text tutorials
18:07 - so we like to see something and build
18:09 - something so yeah that's why energy
18:12 - exactly the best thing is that it's for
18:13 - free so really put it in your portfolio

19:32 - let's go so what we're going to do at
19:34 - this point so we have our config file
19:36 - set so the first thing that i like to do
19:38 - guys is actually sort of
19:39 - mask out the app right so let's go ahead
19:41 - and look at the sort of so this is the
19:43 - facebook
19:44 - clone app right here so let's go ahead
19:46 - and quickly sign in
19:47 - so we can go ahead and see it so this is
19:49 - the build that we deployed earlier
19:51 - so i'm just going to sign in and then
19:52 - we're going to use this to mask out what
19:53 - we're going to build in our app
19:55 - all right so as you can see we have a
19:57 - few things inside the actual app so
19:59 - let's go ahead and make it a little bit
20:00 - bigger
20:01 - and let's go ahead and make this more so
20:03 - we have the header component
20:05 - right so we have this header component
20:06 - up here so
20:08 - this thing right here and what we're
20:10 - going to do is we're going to go ahead
20:11 - and just mask it out so
20:13 - down here i'm going to go ahead and say
20:16 - the
20:17 - header component oh another donation

20:23 - says
20:24 - capti saying awesome work guys any
20:26 - thoughts on electron gis
20:28 - js um electron i think
20:31 - uh what you use to make desktop apps
20:34 - with react
20:35 - right so i mean it's it's awesome
20:37 - awesome
20:38 - uh like it's an awesome sort of thing to
20:40 - use if you're gonna i think slack was
20:42 - actually built using electron
20:43 - so it's very very promising um in terms
20:46 - of
20:47 - what i think of it i mean i guess we're
20:48 - just gonna have to try and we're gonna
20:50 - have to start building some stuff with
20:51 - it to go ahead and get a better insight
20:53 - but yeah it's definitely promising i
20:55 - know a lot of big companies use electron
20:56 - js especially you know right now tech
20:58 - companies that are very
21:00 - you know uh what is the word prestigious
21:03 - or whatever
21:04 - they do use electron js on their stack
21:06 - but we might visit it on a later
21:08 - note and we also got another donation by

21:39 - raining donations today you guys are
21:41 - bringing in so much love
21:43 - nice dude so we've got that header
21:45 - component that we spoke about
21:47 - and then we essentially have everything
21:49 - underneath right so everything
21:50 - underneath is essentially
21:52 - damn it guys don't do this don't spam
21:54 - the chat
21:56 - yeah i have to block it and not even
21:58 - share with you guys if you guys start
21:59 - doing that because
22:00 - it doesn't make it easy for us to share
22:02 - if you guys do that so please
22:04 - keep it clean we're all trying to learn
22:06 - exactly guys please keep that
22:07 - stuff clean so now what we're going to
22:09 - do is we're going to actually go ahead
22:11 - and this would be the app body so we're
22:12 - going to have a section
22:14 - called app body so this is going to say
22:15 - app body like so
22:17 - and then inside the app body we're going
22:18 - to have a few components right so we're
22:20 - going to have
22:20 - the sidebar right we're going to have
22:24 - the feed right so we have the sidebar
22:27 - on the on the left side here so this
22:30 - stuff right here is the sidebar
22:31 - we have the feed in the center right and
22:34 - the feed consists of a bunch of
22:35 - different things it has this like lovely
22:37 - little stories part as this message
22:39 - component
22:40 - and then it has the rest of them posts
22:42 - down here and then we have the widgets
22:44 - on the right okay so we have this
22:46 - widgets
22:47 - section over here so over here we pretty
22:49 - much have this
22:50 - live feed which comes from
22:52 - cleverprogrammer facebook itself
22:54 - so that will be on the right so widgets
22:57 - and so you're using facebook api for
23:00 - this then um so
23:01 - the stuff that you actually go ahead and
23:03 - see on the right we're actually using
23:05 - uh let me go ahead and make this full
23:06 - screen so the stuff that you got you saw
23:08 - on the right was actually using
23:09 - something
23:09 - called an iframe so it's actually an
23:12 - embed
23:13 - from facebook itself and they provide
23:15 - that and you can go ahead and use that
23:16 - for free
23:17 - so we're going to show you yeah we're
23:19 - going to show you guys how to go ahead
23:20 - and do that
23:22 - awesome so with that said we are going
23:25 - to go ahead and
23:26 - start this thing so let's go
23:29 - let's go to the the app and the first
23:32 - thing we're going to do guys
23:33 - is build the header component because
23:36 - the header components
23:37 - a very visual component it'll be very
23:39 - easy to see what we're doing so
23:40 - this thing right over here at the top
23:43 - right
23:43 - so the first thing we're going to do is
23:45 - we're actually going to go ahead and go
23:46 - to our files
23:47 - and we're going to create a header dot
23:50 - js component
23:51 - like so and then inside of here we're
23:54 - going to do rfce
23:55 - and you see we get this nice little
23:56 - snippet which builds out the component
23:58 - for us
23:59 - if you want to know how we get that go
24:01 - over to the extensions here and type in
24:02 - es7
24:04 - and it's actually the first one it's a
24:06 - very popular library it's called es7
24:07 - react redux
24:08 - graphql snippets and it's this one with
24:11 - 1.7 million downloads
24:13 - you want to make sure that you go ahead
24:14 - and download that and it will allow
24:17 - you to get those little snippets that
24:19 - we're doing
24:20 - throughout our builds so that's nice and
24:23 - now with that said
24:24 - we want to every time we create a new
24:26 - component we're going to go ahead give
24:27 - it a class name
24:28 - so like this it's going to say header
24:30 - and we're also going to go ahead
24:32 - and do the following we're going to say
24:33 - import header
24:35 - dot css and what we need to do then is
24:37 - go ahead and create the
24:39 - appropriate css file like so and that's
24:42 - going to be a step that we repeat
24:44 - we rinse and repeat that step guys so
24:46 - we're going to keep on doing that step
24:48 - over and over whenever we need to create
24:49 - a component so
24:50 - get very fast doing that save you a lot
24:52 - of time we just got another donation
24:54 - frankie
24:56 - wow dot net sean what's up microsoft
24:59 - teams slack

25:04 - electron thank you for the information
25:05 - man
25:06 - appreciate it nice wow oh damn i didn't
25:09 - know vs code was built in electron

25:18 - elektron uses oh man it's just this is

25:46 - chat donations thank you
25:49 - we appreciate it that's insane thank you
25:51 - guys
25:52 - awesome so let's go ahead and build that
25:54 - header component so
25:56 - the first thing we're going to do is go
25:57 - over to the header
25:59 - component itself and we need to go ahead
26:01 - and build it out so
26:02 - the header is actually split into three
26:04 - different areas right so
26:06 - we have the sort of center we have
26:09 - the left and we have the right
26:12 - right got another donation thank you so
26:14 - much frankie go ahead and read that one
26:16 - out while i annotate
26:18 - md he says you guys are building the
26:20 - project that i wanted to see
26:21 - learn a lot from you thank you thank you
26:23 - so much man i know that you know
26:25 - facebook new version hasn't been gone
26:26 - hasn't been out for a long time so it's
26:29 - even
26:30 - that much more surprising you know i
26:31 - myself don't even use a new ui
26:33 - as of now but you know maybe after this
26:35 - build i'll start using it exactly dude
26:38 - exactly so oh it's another donation holy
26:42 - crap it's raining donations dude
26:44 - fun with sanji thank you dude appreciate
26:46 - you
26:48 - nice [ __ ] so the header component guys
26:50 - is split into
26:52 - three different and another one damn
26:54 - dude
26:55 - don't let us code yeah i always wanted
26:57 - to work on a potential startup idea
26:59 - sonny inspired me thank you guys
27:01 - wow oh man thank you dude i love seeing
27:04 - stuff like that the whole team is
27:07 - we were involved in a startup too right
27:10 - yeah
27:11 - so i actually was involved in yeah i
27:13 - actually have worked for a couple of
27:14 - stops and i had my own startup for a
27:16 - while and i
27:17 - actually teach a bunch of this inside of
27:18 - the profit javascript course
27:20 - link in the description and we actually
27:22 - go ahead and talk about all of those
27:23 - things talk about the experiences that i
27:25 - ran into
27:26 - and all those things and how you guys
27:27 - can sort of skip that headache
27:29 - and just become streamlined into sort of
27:32 - doing well
27:33 - and succeeding in what you're doing so
27:35 - yeah really interesting stuff right
27:36 - there
27:36 - that'll be awesome dude talk about that
27:40 - yes so guys jumping back to the code so
27:43 - the header component
27:44 - we split it into these three areas we
27:47 - had header left header middle
27:49 - and header right so this is what you
27:51 - want to do when you essentially go ahead
27:53 - and
27:54 - um oh damn it dude some people are like
27:57 - blocking this in the chat
27:58 - there we go guys it's gonna i'm telling
28:01 - you it's gonna get it's gonna get
28:02 - spammed
28:02 - or i might just take the website down if
28:04 - that happens so let's keep the chat
28:06 - clean
28:06 - nice so here what we're gonna do is
28:08 - we're gonna do a header left so we're
28:10 - gonna do header
28:11 - left like so and then we're gonna have a
28:16 - header middle so div header
28:20 - oops header middle and if the reason why
28:22 - i'm typing this way
28:24 - is because this is the bem convention so
28:25 - it's inside the header component
28:27 - and we're using the middle element the
28:29 - left element and we also need to do the
28:30 - right element so we're going to say div
28:32 - dot header
28:33 - right so as such right and if you're
28:35 - wondering how i'm doing these shortcuts
28:37 - it's using something called emmet
28:39 - so emma is something another donation
28:41 - wow
28:43 - says is php still relevant is facebook
28:46 - still run on php
28:47 - do you want to answer that frankie um so
28:51 - it used to use php once it begun but now
28:53 - it's using react so they developed react
28:55 - out of you know
28:56 - solving their own problems and they
28:58 - brought the world with this amazing
29:00 - library
29:00 - and now we're using it to build facebook
29:02 - itself exactly guys yeah so they
29:05 - actually the app that we showed you
29:06 - earlier which was built by facebook
29:08 - themselves
29:08 - they revamped the entire app in with
29:11 - using react
29:12 - um so some of their pages might be using
29:14 - php still so there is still a chance
29:16 - that some of their pages are using php
29:18 - but i wouldn't say it's the relevant
29:20 - thing that you should focus your time on
29:21 - focus your time on javascript react
29:23 - that's going to bring you the most value
29:26 - we have another amazing donation by
29:28 - dover keen and what do they say frankie
29:31 - it says is there a react native coming
29:33 - soon coming someday soon
29:36 - yes dude we have react native content
29:38 - coming soon
29:39 - you know how we do it we listen guys i
29:42 - love i love mobile development man and
29:44 - hybrid when i learned about hybrid
29:46 - development i was like whoa
29:48 - that was what that was that was the
29:50 - thing that was missing from the industry
29:52 - and now you know you can use react to
29:54 - even build this using react native so
29:56 - that's amazing and beautiful you guys
29:58 - are going to be seeing that in the
29:58 - future
29:59 - no doubt exactly and then you can
30:01 - actually deploy your apps onto the app
30:03 - store and we can see who
30:04 - who gets the most popularity that'll be
30:06 - awesome to see nice
30:07 - dude with just under a thousand viewers
30:09 - this is insane
30:11 - oh my god oh let's go
30:14 - so much we just got another donation now
30:17 - he says
30:18 - sandy mena he said he's sending a dop
30:21 - 500 i don't know what dop is if you guys
30:23 - know what currency is dropped in the
30:24 - comments
30:24 - he says guys you have the best content
30:26 - thank you man so much we are at
30:28 - 51 in chat donations at the moment
30:31 - insane
30:32 - thank you so much guys thank you so so
30:35 - much i saw somebody was asking a
30:37 - question about why we have the
30:38 - underscores that is
30:39 - known as the bem naming convention just
30:42 - to clarify for those of you who missed
30:43 - that
30:44 - so we have these three sections header
30:46 - left header middle and header right
30:48 - uh what we're going to do is we're going
30:49 - to drop an image into the
30:51 - top so the image is going to be the
30:53 - actual facebook logo
30:54 - so this is the facebook logo right here
30:57 - so you can go ahead and just copy that
30:58 - and if we
30:58 - go ahead and refresh our page we should
31:01 - actually see oh we're actually pulling
31:02 - in our components so we built this
31:04 - header component
31:05 - but we actually need to go ahead and use
31:06 - it so we can get rid of this
31:08 - uh annotation we can just do the
31:10 - following we say this
31:12 - and guys shortcut for you if you go to
31:13 - the end of the header
31:15 - text and you actually press command
31:16 - control spacebar you get the auto import
31:19 - ability so that doesn't always work but
31:21 - if you can get that working
31:22 - it's a very nice little shortcut frankie
31:24 - we just hit over a thousand
31:26 - viewers dude whoa in a thousand likes at
31:28 - the same time
31:34 - they're saying d.o.p is dominican pesos
31:36 - thank you guys so much
31:37 - appreciate you guys very on top of it
31:39 - love it yeah i was in the dominican
31:41 - before lockdown so that that's awesome
31:44 - thank you so much dude nice
31:47 - so let's go ahead and you can see that's
31:49 - huge right now right so
31:51 - we actually don't want to have this
31:53 - massive image so let's go ahead and make
31:54 - that a little smaller so it's a bit
31:56 - easier to work with
31:57 - and the way we're going to do that is
31:59 - we're going to go ahead i'm just going
32:00 - to make this a little bit bigger at the
32:02 - moment
32:02 - so i can see a bit more of what i'm
32:04 - doing so let's go ahead and actually
32:06 - style this a bit so what we're going to
32:09 - do is
32:09 - we're going to go to that image and
32:11 - we're going to target it and we're going
32:12 - to say inside of the header left so
32:14 - let's go to our header.css
32:15 - and we're going to say inside of header
32:19 - left like so inside a header left
32:22 - inside of the image we're going to say
32:24 - give it a height of 40 pixels
32:26 - so a height of 48 pixels and as soon as
32:28 - we save that you'll see that the
32:30 - facebook logo then shrinks a huge amount
32:32 - so that's going to allow us to actually
32:33 - go ahead and see it in a much more
32:35 - easier way is that some sort of standard
32:38 - like 40 pixels for logos
32:40 - no no no i actually just went ahead and
32:42 - matched it to a close sort of comparison
32:44 - to what they have on their site
32:46 - beautiful yeah so a lot of this is done
32:48 - using the inspect tool and checking what
32:50 - they're using and things like that
32:52 - um nice so that's the header left uh we
32:55 - also have a search icon right so the
32:57 - search icon that you guys see at the top
32:59 - left inside of the facebook clone that
33:02 - up here
33:02 - on this top thing right here so we're
33:04 - actually going to go ahead and build a
33:05 - custom
33:06 - search icon search yeah search field for
33:08 - ourselves and in order to do that
33:10 - we're going to need material ui library
33:12 - to get all of these funky icons that you
33:14 - see over here
33:15 - and even these side ones and the way we
33:17 - do that guys
33:18 - is as i go over to the website frank you
33:21 - want to explain quickly what material ui
33:23 - actually is awesome so material ui is a
33:26 - library for css and the cool thing about
33:29 - it is that
33:30 - it's one of the most popular css
33:31 - libraries um i think
33:33 - bootstrap is one as well right and so
33:36 - the cool thing about it is that it
33:37 - brings
33:38 - really really pristine really nice and
33:41 - clean icons that developers can use
33:44 - so you can just go to their website just
33:45 - like sunny is doing right now
33:47 - and he's actually getting the snippets
33:48 - of code and then you can start using
33:50 - them on your projects
33:51 - really just like that exactly exactly
33:54 - guys so this is going to give you a
33:55 - bunch of components a bunch of styling
33:57 - layout components
33:59 - as well as a really really useful icon
34:01 - library which is what we're pretty much
34:02 - going to be using it for today
34:03 - but what you need to do is go ahead and
34:05 - install the core
34:06 - so the first thing we're going to do is
34:08 - go ahead pop open our terminal
34:10 - and what i like to do guys is actually
34:12 - open up a second terminal so you don't
34:14 - actually close your
34:15 - running instance of react so we actually
34:17 - got that running on
34:18 - the first terminal go ahead and make
34:20 - sure you're inside the directory so do
34:22 - facebook clone
34:23 - get inside there uh oh damn dude check
34:26 - out check out the donation man check out

35:02 - we're going to go
35:03 - over to this and we're going to say mpmi
35:06 - and we're going to do npm install oh
35:07 - sorry i've already done that so let's go
35:09 - ahead and cancel that command
35:10 - let's do npm install material i ui core
35:13 - and then what i want you guys to do is
35:14 - go to the search bar type in icons
35:16 - go down here and what you'll see is
35:19 - you'll get this
35:20 - other command right so you're going to
35:21 - wait until the first one is finished
35:23 - and once that's done we're going to go
35:25 - ahead and do npm
35:26 - install material ui icons so let's go
35:29 - ahead
35:30 - and wait for that till that's done um
35:34 - and what i want to tell you guys is so
35:36 - we need to run this command once this
35:38 - is finished installing so we just added
35:40 - the core there and we're going to do
35:41 - this
35:42 - material ui icons and while that's
35:43 - installing guys make sure you click this
35:45 - you can where it says you can search the
35:47 - full list of these icons so click that
35:49 - and let's go ahead and check it so
35:53 - now you get this very very nice like
35:55 - sort of search
35:56 - so this icon search tool right and here
35:59 - if i go ahead and type in search for
36:01 - example you get like a nice little
36:02 - search icon
36:04 - click it and you get the import code for
36:05 - it so that's how
36:07 - we actually go ahead and get a lot of
36:08 - our icons we go ahead and
36:10 - use this tool and it will actually go
36:12 - ahead and give us the code to pull that
36:13 - into our project look at this sonny

37:29 - nice so this is the so we just installed
37:31 - the icons right and this is the search
37:33 - tool that is
37:34 - which is how we actually go ahead and
37:35 - get it so with that said let's hop
37:38 - back over to our local host over here so
37:40 - let's go back to our local host
37:41 - and inside the middle div what we're
37:44 - going to do is we're going to actually
37:45 - know inside the header left div
37:46 - we're going to go ahead and add a second
37:48 - div called header
37:50 - input and this is going to be
37:51 - responsible for actually having all of
37:53 - this stuff
37:54 - involved around that input field so
37:56 - we're going to have a search icon
37:57 - and an input field so search icon and an
38:00 - input field
38:01 - go ahead and save that and here if we
38:04 - actually see it says search icon is not
38:06 - defined
38:07 - so if i go ahead and i need to actually
38:09 - import this so let's go ahead and import
38:11 - this into our project
38:12 - so we can say go to the top and you can
38:14 - say import
38:15 - search icon for material ui
38:18 - once we save that another donation sunil

38:42 - good don't get me wrong
38:43 - angular i wouldn't i wouldn't really go
38:45 - down that route but react is the one to
38:47 - go for guys it's the most wanted
38:49 - language right now
38:50 - it is the highest paying language as
38:53 - well out of the three frameworks
38:54 - make sure you go ahead and use that and
38:56 - guys we will also be dropping so frankie

39:44 - much karuna
39:46 - nice so with that said guys we're gonna
39:48 - go ahead and
39:49 - carry on so we've got the search icon
39:51 - the input text and you can see this
39:52 - isn't looking too great at the moment
39:54 - but we're gonna style this we're gonna
39:55 - make it look really nice at the end
39:57 - uh we've got another donation by sunil
40:00 - bahira he says one video on react server
40:02 - side rendering
40:03 - oh that's actually really interesting
40:04 - dude i can't actually pin it for some
40:05 - reason
40:06 - um but that's a really really
40:07 - interesting one uh we will we will
40:09 - actually consider doing that so
40:11 - i'm going to go ahead and pop it on the
40:12 - screen so you can see one video on react
40:14 - server side rendering
40:16 - um so next js or something like that we
40:18 - can actually probably go ahead and do
40:19 - something like that that'll be awesome
40:21 - yeah so we're going to go ahead and
40:23 - inside the center now
40:25 - inside the center so the center is where
40:28 - we have
40:29 - all of these icons right so we have all
40:31 - these icons right here
40:32 - and what we're going to do is we're
40:33 - going to actually for each of those
40:35 - icons
40:36 - i'm going to go ahead and create a div
40:37 - and i'm going to say each of those divs
40:39 - are going to be
40:39 - header underscore underscore option so
40:42 - they're going to be each of them is
40:43 - going to be an option
40:44 - and inside of it it's going to have an
40:45 - icon so in this top one we're going to
40:47 - have something called the home icon
40:49 - so let's go ahead and import that so the
40:52 - way we write that is
40:53 - as such we say home icon font size is
40:55 - large
40:56 - and i'm just going to go ahead and pull
40:58 - in a bunch of these icons right now for
41:00 - you guys
41:02 - so there we go i just pulled in a few
41:04 - icons so we can use them later on but
41:05 - you can see now we just actually went
41:07 - ahead and pulled in
41:08 - this little lovely icon right here so
41:11 - sagar dumbbell thank you so much just
41:13 - dropped another donation
41:15 - appreciate that dude thank you so much
41:18 - man we
41:18 - appreciate that you guys are going crazy
41:21 - with the donations thank you guys so
41:22 - much man
41:23 - yeah this is awesome this is really
41:25 - awesome so we added we added the
41:27 - search loop thing on on the the
41:30 - what is it called the magnifying glass
41:31 - and then the actual home icon as well
41:33 - right
41:34 - exactly exactly that so we added that
41:36 - and then we added
41:37 - the uh magnifying glass and then we
41:39 - added the home icon right
41:40 - so you can see we're going to follow
41:42 - this convention so i'm going to go ahead
41:43 - and copy this
41:45 - and you see now we've got another div
41:46 - with the class name of header option
41:48 - let's go ahead and drop that down
41:49 - and here where we've got the home icon
41:51 - i'm going to change this one to a flag
41:52 - icon
41:53 - and the flag icon will simply represent
41:56 - this flag
41:56 - right here okay so this flag that you
41:59 - see right here
42:00 - that will be this one over here so i'm
42:02 - going to go up to the top and i'm going
42:03 - to go ahead and import that and we
42:04 - actually did import that earlier
42:06 - with this line of code right here so
42:09 - going back down
42:10 - save the file and you should be able to
42:12 - now see a flag pop in
42:14 - so i've actually got a snippet of code
42:15 - which will save us a little bit of time
42:16 - and i've done this for the remainder of
42:19 - these
42:19 - uh icons so there's three more icons
42:22 - that we do this for
42:23 - and they are as such there's a
42:25 - supervised
42:26 - user circle icon honestly these names i
42:29 - actually don't know these names where
42:30 - why they call them this but this is the
42:32 - names that you're gonna have to import
42:34 - and the import code is here for them
42:37 - so this will go ahead and pull in the
42:39 - required dependencies that you guys will
42:41 - need
42:42 - now with that said we are going to go
42:45 - ahead and finish
42:46 - and chuck the remainder of the stuff
42:48 - inside of header right
42:50 - so we're basically positioning ourselves
42:51 - at this point so we're putting all the
42:53 - stuff on the page and then we've got
42:54 - we're giving everything appropriate
42:56 - class names
42:57 - and then we're going to go ahead and add
42:59 - some nice little css to this
43:01 - so on the app we can see we've got this
43:04 - top section where it has here on the
43:07 - here we have the
43:09 - um let's go ahead and make it a little
43:11 - bigger so we have the info
43:13 - so this i'm going to actually sort of
43:14 - containerize this a little bit
43:16 - and i'm going to have it so that this is
43:18 - actually a container of its own
43:19 - and this one we're going to call the
43:21 - header info and then we're just going to
43:23 - list out the rest of these icons so each
43:25 - one of these ones is an icon so you've
43:26 - got one
43:27 - two three four different icons over here
43:31 - so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go
43:32 - over here back to our app
43:34 - and we're gonna go ahead and create a
43:37 - div
43:37 - which says header info so div header
43:40 - info as such
43:42 - and inside this one we're going to have
43:43 - two things we're going to have an avatar
43:45 - component
43:46 - so the avatar component is one of my
43:47 - favorite components
43:49 - it saves you a bunch of headache from
43:51 - whenever you need an avatar inside of
43:52 - your app so that little
43:54 - circle profile picture that you always
43:56 - need inside of apps
43:58 - to get it you just need to do this
43:59 - import and then you can actually go
44:01 - ahead and just use it as such and it
44:03 - just takes a source but right now we
44:04 - don't have a source so i'm just gonna
44:06 - it has this nice little placeholder in
44:08 - the meantime
44:09 - and then what we're going to do is we're
44:10 - going to have a h4 right so underneath
44:12 - it we're going to have a h4
44:14 - and this one is just going to say for
44:15 - example let's just say right now it says
44:17 - sunny sanger like this right or for now
44:20 - let's just chuck in the insta
44:22 - handle so there we go this is anger nice
44:24 - so it doesn't
44:25 - go too long there we go and now we have
44:29 - that in place and we're going to add
44:31 - those icons right so we have
44:33 - icons like the add icon we have the ad
44:35 - icon the forum icon
44:37 - so all those icons i showed you guys
44:39 - previously basically notice how when i
44:41 - click them
44:42 - they're actually clickable buttons and
44:43 - the way we do that is we actually use a
44:46 - component called
44:47 - icon button and the icon button
44:49 - component is actually an awesome
44:51 - component
44:51 - it's got another donation thank you so
44:53 - much and meet kumar
44:55 - that's it appreciate that dude thank you
44:57 - so much man we really love you guys
44:59 - that's insane dude thank you so we've
45:01 - got another donation there and then
45:03 - we're going to basically go ahead and
45:04 - pop in the following so
45:05 - the way we do it is we pull in the icon
45:07 - button component
45:09 - and then we just wrap that around the
45:10 - add icon component
45:12 - so we're going to go ahead and add
45:14 - import these two
45:15 - extra imports at the top so we need the
45:18 - avatar and the icon button um so we need
45:22 - the following so
45:24 - let's go ahead and pull this in so at
45:27 - the top of the file
45:28 - we're going to go ahead and drop this
45:30 - import right here
45:32 - so there we go there we go we actually
45:34 - impose the rest of the dependencies that
45:36 - we need
45:38 - so awesome so for you to use all of
45:39 - those icons you first have to import
45:41 - them
45:41 - make sure you remember about that guys
45:44 - something is not functioning it's
45:46 - probably that if it's your icons
45:48 - related to that exactly and you'll get
45:50 - an error on the screen if that happens
45:52 - so make sure you keep an eye out for
45:53 - that so now i'm going to go ahead and
45:54 - pop a snippet in right here so these are
45:56 - the rest of the icons
45:58 - and you can see when we do that now you
46:00 - can see they're clickable elements
46:02 - so you see we've got clickable little
46:03 - beautiful icons right here
46:05 - but this entire thing does not look like
46:08 - a header right now
46:08 - okay so we're going to make it look like
46:10 - a header and the first thing we're going
46:12 - to do is
46:13 - make sure you've given the appropriate
46:15 - class name so we've got header header
46:16 - left header input
46:17 - in the middle you see all of these class
46:19 - names are actually very important for
46:20 - the next step
46:21 - we're going to go ahead and get rid of
46:23 - the h1 which says let's build a facebook
46:25 - clone
46:26 - because we don't want that let's click
46:27 - save and let's go ahead and start this
46:31 - so inside of the header what i'm going
46:33 - to go ahead and do now is target the
46:35 - header and this bit i love
46:36 - right because as we do this next step
46:39 - you can actually dynamically see
46:40 - everything pop out on the screen
46:42 - right which is a really really nice
46:44 - thing
46:46 - so a lot of people are saying will the
46:48 - video be recorded and uploaded yes all
46:50 - our videos are uploaded straight away
46:52 - afterwards
46:53 - and you guys can watch them back at your
46:54 - own pace so if you have to go
46:56 - you have to watch anything make sure you
46:58 - smash the thumbs up button and come back
46:59 - a different time so what we're going to
47:03 - do now is we're going to add a display
47:06 - let's add a little bit of let's add a
47:07 - display flex first so let's go ahead and
47:09 - do this
47:10 - display flex and this will go ahead and
47:13 - make everything go into a row
47:14 - so now we've got the header left the
47:17 - header center and the header right in a
47:19 - row now that's why it's dropped like
47:20 - that
47:21 - and then what we need to do is add a bit
47:22 - of padding so i'm going to say 15 pixels
47:25 - and what this does guys is it adds 15 on
47:28 - the
47:29 - top and bottom and it adds
47:32 - uh 20 on the left and right oh we just
47:35 - got a nice
47:36 - donation wow daniel bastos a hug from
47:39 - brazil

48:02 - i think i think yeah
48:03 - i think we're live i think we're doing
48:06 - pretty good right now
48:07 - we're live nice so we added a little bit
48:10 - of padding
48:11 - and then what we're going to do is we're
48:12 - going to go ahead and add in the
48:14 - following so we're going to say justify
48:16 - content space between
48:17 - so this should actually push all the
48:19 - elements apart from each other
48:20 - so let's go ahead and save and you can
48:22 - see it pushes all of the elements away
48:24 - from each other
48:24 - oh we also got another donation from
48:26 - nishan patel he goes you guys are doing
48:28 - a superb job
48:30 - helping so many people learn new skills
48:32 - thank you dude appreciate
48:34 - that massively that's awesome dude
48:37 - thank you man really really appreciate
48:38 - you nishant love it
48:41 - yeah this is awesome dude uh and my
48:43 - comments have finally come back in so i
48:45 - can see
48:45 - nice so now what we're also going to do
48:47 - guys is we're going to make the
48:49 - top uh sticky which means that so
48:52 - let's go back to the upright oh oops
48:55 - okay that's bad
48:56 - somebody guys please don't post in uh
48:58 - things like that in the chat let's go
49:00 - ahead and just do
49:01 - see yeah guys keep it clean come on
49:05 - yeah we are all learning here we want to
49:06 - show you guys the real demo but we're
49:08 - going to have to
49:09 - bring it down if you guys are not you
49:11 - know being respectful for everybody's
49:13 - teachings
49:14 - exactly guys let's go ahead and keep it
49:16 - clean so right now
49:17 - for the app we have this um
49:21 - where is it i'm talking about we have
49:23 - the yeah so the actual
49:24 - top bar sticks to the top of the page
49:26 - right so we want to also do that
49:28 - so we're going to do position sticky and
49:30 - set a background color of white and a z
49:32 - index of
49:32 - 100 so it never gets overwritten by any
49:35 - other
49:36 - component so let's go ahead and do this
49:40 - nice and then with that said we're going
49:42 - gonna go ahead and add
49:44 - a top of zero and also we're gonna add a
49:46 - box shadow so it floats
49:47 - right so it's gonna float from the top
49:49 - of the page so as soon as i add that now
49:50 - you can see that
49:51 - it has this nice little flow it's very
49:53 - subtle but it's a little flow
49:55 - and what we're gonna do now is for the
49:57 - left side we're going to basically go
49:58 - ahead and add the following we're going
49:59 - to say
50:00 - display flex on the header left which
50:03 - means
50:03 - that the logo should go in line with
50:06 - the uh search input field so let's go
50:10 - ahead and do that
50:11 - nice and then we are going to target the
50:13 - header
50:14 - input so we're going to go ahead and
50:16 - target that header input that we're sort
50:17 - of looking at
50:19 - and here i'm going to go ahead and do
50:20 - display flex align item center
50:22 - so save that and you can see what this
50:25 - does is it basically aligns that
50:27 - centrally
50:28 - on the vertical axis right so it's going
50:32 - to align it centrally on the vertical
50:33 - axis
50:34 - i'm going to then give that input a
50:35 - background color
50:37 - of uh it's like an off sort of gray
50:39 - that's the one that i have on the
50:41 - app i'm going to give a padding of 10
50:44 - pixels and a margin
50:46 - left let's go ahead and do that nice
50:49 - and then i'm going to give a border
50:50 - radius of 999 pixels which gives you a
50:52 - perfect
50:53 - oval so you can go ahead and do that uh
50:56 - and at this point
50:57 - guys we should actually be good to move
51:00 - on to the next step so let's go ahead
51:01 - and make it
51:02 - 33 for now until it gets bigger
51:04 - otherwise it's good
51:05 - we're at one two three four likes let's
51:07 - go
51:08 - one thousand two hundred and thirty four
51:09 - likes that's amazing oh but i love that
51:12 - number
51:13 - that's so much we really appreciate that
51:14 - we're also at sixty dollar chat donation
51:17 - so we wouldn't be here with you guys
51:18 - really appreciate it smash the like
51:20 - button if you guys are enjoying this
51:22 - it's going to be exactly massively
51:23 - massive we appreciate you guys
51:25 - awesome so um with that
51:28 - we're basically going to go ahead and
51:30 - we've styled the input so we went ahead
51:32 - and added a bunch of styling to the
51:34 - input container
51:35 - um the header input so we're going to
51:37 - make that back to 999. save that again
51:39 - and here what we're going to do is go
51:42 - down
51:43 - and now so that's the header input
51:45 - container
51:46 - but you see the actual input inside if
51:48 - we go ahead and target the actual
51:50 - input so what we're talking about here
51:52 - is the actual input inside of header
51:54 - input
51:55 - we actually need to go ahead and target
51:56 - that and we're going to say border none
51:58 - so this will actually go ahead and get
51:59 - rid of this little border we're also
52:01 - going to say background color is
52:02 - transparent so this will mean it will
52:04 - blend in with the background
52:05 - and then outline width of zero we'll
52:07 - actually go ahead and get rid of this
52:08 - little blue
52:09 - sort of that we see right here we've got
52:11 - another lovely donation by
52:12 - shriver srivats star payatti he says can
52:16 - you please create react.js tutorial
52:18 - for beginners that's something which i'm
52:20 - actually i'm actually thinking of doing
52:22 - soon actually
52:23 - yeah that would be dope yeah i think on
52:26 - that
52:26 - yeah teaching you guys from completely
52:29 - scratch

52:37 - that guys
52:38 - nice so oh damn kenny hey
52:41 - let's go dude i think i recognize this
52:44 - guy yeah
52:44 - yeah guys there is a way to
52:46 - self-organize my files into react
52:48 - component
52:49 - or pages and best practices maybe a
52:51 - course in the future
52:52 - live thanks a lot nice so kenny hank to
52:55 - answer your question
52:57 - uh to organize your files into your
52:59 - react components or pages
53:00 - that's actually firstly you answered
53:02 - your question right there so i would
53:03 - actually start by just organizing it
53:05 - into
53:06 - so i have a components folder and have a
53:07 - pages folder and then
53:09 - if you have a react router i would have
53:10 - some routing and
53:12 - depending on what pages you have have
53:14 - the pages in that photo
53:16 - and then all the reusable com components
53:19 - have inside of a components folder so
53:20 - start with that
53:21 - as for best practices there's so many
53:23 - things to cover here we try and cover a
53:25 - lot of best practice
53:26 - practices through our builds like the
53:27 - bem naming convention but
53:29 - i would highly recommend dude if you are
53:31 - interested in all of these things
53:33 - definitely go ahead and check out the
53:34 - course because i have live coaching
53:35 - calls every single tuesday where we do
53:37 - talk about
53:38 - all of the best practices every single
53:41 - thing that you could possibly ask you
53:42 - can ask inside of that
53:44 - um so honestly definitely make sure you
53:46 - check that out but
53:47 - thank you so much description below yep
53:49 - thank you so much man i appreciate you
53:50 - and then also supra dropped the 40
53:53 - 40 indian rupees donation thank you so
53:55 - much yeah he asks
53:56 - do we have any framework for easy css
53:59 - without code
54:00 - yes so there is actually tailwind css
54:03 - which is actually
54:04 - a big css framework out right now we're
54:06 - actually going to be dropping some
54:07 - content on that soon i haven't played
54:09 - with it too much but
54:10 - i know it's hot right now yeah so
54:12 - there's a lot of people doing that
54:13 - amazing
54:14 - i also know that if you're a designer
54:15 - you can use figma and i actually
54:18 - talked about that in my other video top
54:19 - seven tools that all developers should
54:21 - use
54:22 - so figma is amazing because if you're a
54:23 - designer you can just literally design
54:25 - drag and drop design there and then on
54:27 - the on the actual side it gives you the
54:29 - css and html codes so you can
54:32 - design something by drag and drop
54:34 - functionalities and then add them to
54:35 - your
54:36 - you know coding environment by getting
54:38 - the css portion of it
54:40 - that's really good point dude because uh
54:42 - i actually use that in a lot of
54:43 - professional environments where designer
54:44 - would give me the designs and the css is
54:46 - attached with things like figma so
54:48 - that's really really powerful yeah nice
54:52 - dope so we have styled the input so as
54:55 - soon as i save this
54:56 - notice how this is going to change right
54:57 - so we save it boom it gets rid of
55:00 - that that sort of uh stuff that problem
55:02 - that we had
55:03 - now right now obviously this is not
55:05 - ideal we don't want it to be this oval
55:06 - right here
55:07 - so what we need to do is we need to go
55:09 - down to the
55:11 - header center and we basically need to
55:14 - make that display flex because right now
55:16 - what it's doing is it's pulling this
55:17 - entire container down
55:19 - and we want everything here to be inside
55:20 - of a row as opposed to going up
55:22 - vertically
55:23 - so as soon as i save this we should see
55:27 - um we should see everything go into a
55:30 - row
55:30 - and let's double check why that hasn't
55:32 - happened let's go ahead and do headers
55:33 - oh this should be header
55:34 - center there we go header center and we
55:38 - save that guys and you'll see it all
55:39 - goes into a nice
55:40 - row there we go and then what we're
55:43 - going to do is we're going to say
55:44 - header option and here guys material ui
55:48 - gives
55:48 - um all of the
55:52 - all of its sort of icons this class
55:54 - right here
55:55 - by default so to target it we're saying
55:57 - inside of header option which is each
55:58 - one of these is inside
55:59 - its own header option container change
56:01 - the color to gray so as soon as i save
56:03 - that
56:03 - boom changes the color to gray and now
56:06 - we want it so that when we hover
56:08 - over those options so let's go ahead and
56:10 - add this in
56:11 - we hover over those options the icons
56:13 - will turn into the facebook blue
56:15 - so now you can see as i hover over it we
56:17 - get this nice
56:18 - blue effect so you see it changes into
56:21 - blue
56:21 - as seen there so that's a really nice
56:24 - little add-on there
56:25 - then what we're going to do is for each
56:26 - of those header options
56:28 - i'm going to apply the following styles
56:30 - so i'm going to say
56:31 - display flex uh align item centrally
56:34 - padding of zero pixels uh on the top and
56:38 - bottom 30 on the left and right
56:39 - and change the cursor to a pointer so
56:41 - right now it's as you can see it's the
56:42 - normal mouse but we want to become that
56:45 - little finger so if we save it
56:47 - it should actually makes it into this
56:49 - very nice layout so we can see this
56:50 - right here
56:52 - and you can see at this point this
56:54 - changes to a sort of very nice
56:57 - layout at the top right now we also want
56:59 - to have some hover functionality for
57:00 - that middle so
57:01 - when we hover over it i want it to
57:04 - become very nice in terms of
57:06 - i want it to sort of show a kind of a
57:08 - background color difference a border
57:09 - radius around that
57:11 - align it essentially padding and border
57:13 - bomb so let's go ahead and do that
57:15 - and you can see now we get this lovely
57:17 - little effect
57:19 - right beautiful so now we're starting to
57:20 - see like like the
57:22 - the one that you were building back then
57:24 - exactly with the original build
57:26 - so it starts to come together quite nice
57:28 - um so let's make this a little bit
57:30 - bigger there we go
57:31 - and the next step guys is we're going to
57:33 - go ahead and target the header info so
57:36 - the header info
57:36 - is the text portion over here so header
57:39 - info when i say that i'm referring to
57:41 - literally just this portion so these two
57:44 - things are inside of header info
57:46 - so let's go ahead and do the following
57:48 - so we're going to say inside of header
57:49 - info display flex align item center
57:51 - which means that this will drop next to
57:53 - this
57:53 - as soon as i hit save and boom that's
57:56 - that's exactly what happened
57:57 - then we have a h4 tag so this one right
58:00 - here
58:01 - i'm going to space it a little bit by
58:03 - saying margin left
58:04 - so let's go ahead and do that we say
58:05 - margin left so it's not
58:08 - right next to it and then header right
58:09 - to get everything in these
58:11 - correct line we do display flex
58:15 - and boom look at that it just tied
58:17 - everything up
58:18 - together neatly and now we have hover
58:21 - functionality
58:22 - we have this search field over here and
58:25 - we also have this lovely
58:27 - sort of clickable elements over here
58:29 - which is awesome
58:30 - right so that looks very very clean uh
58:33 - and what i would say guys is
58:35 - as for the half screen size what we
58:38 - we're not going to be covering in this
58:39 - build but you could use media queries at
58:40 - this point
58:41 - to then further enhance this and show as
58:44 - it gets
58:44 - extremely smaller damn dude wow
58:47 - chris connor amazing thank you man thank
58:50 - you so much
58:51 - he's saying any recommendations for
58:54 - showing off
58:55 - ios slash android apps on web portfolio
58:59 - yes dude i actually have a really nice
59:01 - one so i would say is
59:02 - go ahead create yourself a portfolio you
59:04 - can build that in react and launch it on
59:06 - something like firebase
59:07 - go ahead and use your react skills to go
59:10 - ahead and learn react native
59:12 - and what i would say is build some maps
59:14 - with react native and you can actually
59:16 - go ahead
59:16 - and put those you could either launch
59:18 - them in the app store or you can
59:20 - possibly maybe i think there is a way
59:23 - i'm not
59:23 - entirely i can't remember off top of my
59:25 - but there's a way of actually showing
59:26 - like a demo
59:27 - or dude i would actually have a gif
59:29 - maybe of like showing your app
59:30 - on your web portfolio and you can
59:32 - actually have the source code to that
59:34 - app if you don't mind sharing it and
59:36 - yeah that's a really good way of doing
59:37 - it and that will actually give proof
59:39 - that you can actually use react native
59:40 - as well as react
59:41 - so you're not only a web developer but
59:43 - you're also now a mobile
59:46 - native app developer yeah yep yep guys
59:49 - don't forget
59:49 - always put your demo on your portfolio
59:52 - don't only put the picture of your build
59:54 - because once you
59:55 - start seeing the demo how it functions
59:57 - and everything it's just another level
59:59 - to your portfolio because i've seen so
60:00 - many portfolios with just the images
60:02 - it takes off so much takes away so much
60:04 - from the actual build that you made
60:05 - so you put in a lot of energy to that
60:07 - make sure that you show it on a demo
60:09 - exactly and i mean like whenever i see
60:11 - somebody's portfolio and it's just
60:12 - text and it's just images like you want
60:15 - to make sure you have
60:16 - it like a very juicy image and if you
60:18 - can maybe have an animated gif which
60:20 - shows quickly running through the app
60:22 - that's a lot nicer than sort of just
60:24 - doing it
60:25 - as opposed to just seeing some text so
60:27 - awesome thank you so much chris
60:29 - chris connor really really appreciate
60:31 - that donation
60:32 - nice so with that said now what we're
60:34 - going to do is we are going to go over
60:36 - and that's actually for this portion so
60:38 - what we saw is
60:40 - the um initial icon
60:44 - has a nice sort of uh you see this
60:46 - underline to it right so
60:47 - this is like an active state so what we
60:50 - do is in bem
60:51 - we can actually name it so we have this
60:54 - sort of active naming convention
60:56 - so whenever you have a it's called block
60:58 - element so this is
61:00 - the block the header component the
61:02 - element is
61:03 - option and then you can have something
61:04 - called a modifier so in this case
61:06 - we're going to add a class name to the
61:08 - first one we're going to call it
61:10 - header option dash dash active so this
61:12 - is basically saying
61:13 - this is the active button and what we
61:15 - can then do is go to our
61:17 - css and we can target it and we can say
61:21 - do the following we can say for the
61:24 - active
61:24 - container target the material ui icon
61:28 - change the color of that icon to blue
61:30 - and that's becomes active then
61:32 - we're also going to say target the
61:34 - actual container itself so the active
61:36 - container and give it a border bottom a
61:38 - four pixels solid and it's going to be
61:40 - the facebook blue
61:41 - and boom there you go you get that
61:44 - lovely little
61:45 - icon right there beautiful gives it a
61:48 - completely different experience
61:50 - yeah so that's awesome dude like that's
61:53 - looking really really clean
61:54 - we also need to go ahead and add
61:56 - something so like a little nice little
61:58 - placeholder at the top so it says
61:59 - search facebook right so i'm gonna go
62:02 - ahead and add that in now so that one's
62:04 - gonna say
62:05 - let's go ahead and do the following so
62:06 - we're going to say search where is it
62:08 - gone
62:09 - here placeholder and this one we just
62:13 - give it a string which we say search
62:16 - facebook awesome save that
62:20 - and there we go so somebody says why
62:23 - don't you guys use sass
62:24 - so honestly dude like my opinion against
62:27 - sas is
62:28 - things become super nested uh and what
62:31 - happens is when you get nested code it
62:33 - becomes just it just becomes
62:34 - ugly like in my opinion it becomes super
62:37 - ugly it becomes like very very hard to
62:39 - read that code
62:40 - and you want to stay away from stuff
62:42 - like that sas is a very very good
62:44 - library but it's misused that's the
62:46 - problem with the bam very simple
62:48 - and it's very easy to go ahead and use
62:50 - and it's also you don't have to set
62:51 - anything up with them it's just a
62:53 - convention that you follow
62:54 - it's very easy for everyone else to sort
62:56 - of follow that alongside
62:59 - all right so nice so with that said
63:01 - let's jump on and carry on so
63:04 - i love it man because honestly it's such
63:06 - a beginner
63:07 - you know problem when you're starting
63:09 - off you don't know what to name
63:10 - classes or components or anything and
63:13 - then you're just kind of doing it
63:14 - randomly and if you have something like
63:15 - bem
63:16 - you know the bam what is it called the
63:18 - bam um naming convention i guess naming
63:20 - convention
63:21 - yeah that really does help you it
63:23 - grounds you and lets you follow
63:25 - you know something structured so it
63:27 - gives structure to your code
63:28 - exactly it's going to give structure to
63:30 - your code it's going to look super clean
63:32 - guys
63:32 - um awesome so with that
63:36 - said let's go ahead and we added that
63:39 - active icon state so that's really nice
63:42 - and now you guys can see we've done that
63:44 - so what we're going to do
63:46 - now is go back to app.js so we're going
63:48 - to go back to our markdown so this is a
63:50 - good idea guys when you're sort of
63:52 - uh let me share the screen there we go
63:54 - so we're going to go back to
63:55 - our code and i'm going to get rid of
63:57 - this comment there we go
63:58 - nice so here this commenting actually
64:00 - helps us
64:01 - see um what we're gonna be building next
64:05 - so here i said app body so let's go
64:07 - ahead and create a div
64:08 - so everything under the header we
64:09 - consider as the body right so we're
64:10 - gonna say dev
64:11 - app body like so and then we're
64:14 - basically going to shift all of this
64:16 - stuff inside of the app body
64:18 - and the reason why is this will help us
64:19 - with styling later on so we have that
64:21 - now
64:21 - and then we need to build out these
64:23 - three things so let's go ahead and build
64:25 - them out so the first one is the sidebar
64:27 - so the sidebar
64:28 - as such and what we're going to do now
64:30 - is firstly
64:31 - go ahead pop open our file editor do
64:33 - sidebar.js
64:35 - use our very nice little trick called
64:37 - rfce so that's es7 snippets in the
64:39 - extensions
64:42 - and then here we're going to say class
64:43 - name equals sidebar
64:46 - and then we're going to import a
64:49 - sidebar.css like so boom and we have
64:52 - that there
64:54 - now what i'm going to do is i'm going to
64:55 - go ahead and pop in the sidebar.css
64:58 - and that will actually allow us to sort
65:00 - of style this component in a very nice
65:03 - way
65:03 - so somebody asks why don't you use
65:06 - bootstrap with react guys
65:08 - what do you think sonny so bootstrap's
65:10 - very good if you're i would say
65:12 - if you're learning to use bootstrap it's
65:14 - very good for quick turnaround time so
65:15 - the reason being is oh we also got a
65:17 - juicy donation there i'll mention that
65:19 - in a sec
65:20 - so um bootstrap's very good if you have
65:23 - like a lot of clients and you just need
65:24 - to get work out
65:26 - uh it's very good but you have two
65:27 - problems with bootstrap in my opinion
65:29 - one i tend to wrestle with it when i'm
65:31 - using flexbox
65:32 - um and i just prefer to just use
65:34 - straight up flexbox i get the exact
65:36 - design i want as opposed to like near
65:38 - the design that i want so that's my
65:40 - first opinion and
65:41 - also the second thing is uh bootstrap
65:44 - kind of has a look to it
65:46 - like i i know when a website's built
65:48 - with bootstrap
65:50 - whereas if you built it with just pure
65:52 - flexbox it has like a custom
65:54 - clean finish to it so that's my personal
65:56 - take on it what's your idea on that
65:58 - frankie
65:59 - i honestly don't know much about
66:00 - bootstrap but i really like the
66:02 - minimalistic style of the material ui
66:04 - icons
66:05 - and then just you know being able to
66:06 - customize the css how you want it
66:09 - always gives it another another feel to
66:12 - your website i feel like it makes it
66:13 - more personalized so i
66:14 - really really dig that for sure
66:16 - definitely definitely and we got a juicy
66:18 - donation like you said from beatrice
66:20 - to sarah or tahereh and she drops
66:24 - five euros thank you so much she says hi
66:27 - guys amazing work could you guys tell me
66:29 - if this was possible to do with angular
66:31 - why should i choose react over angular
66:33 - all the success for you
66:35 - thank you so much betrays what's your
66:36 - take on this sonny so
66:38 - yes you can definitely build it in
66:40 - angular so these are all just sort of
66:42 - uh angular's a framework react is a
66:44 - library
66:46 - but you can build it definitely with my
66:48 - now react is much easier to learn it's
66:50 - much lighter weight so
66:51 - it's also very performant it's very fast
66:53 - your entry into getting into a react
66:55 - sort of career is much easier than an
66:57 - angular in my opinion also
66:59 - i would recommend it because the job
67:01 - market is higher right now in react
67:03 - the demand is higher in react and the
67:05 - overall average salary is higher in
67:06 - react so there's a lot of
67:08 - pros if you if you're looking into sort
67:10 - of separate yourself from the tech for a
67:11 - sec and look at the opportunities
67:13 - involved you have a lot of things going
67:15 - for you right now if you choose to
67:16 - dive into react yep and i feel like that
67:19 - should be
67:20 - one of your main you know driver for
67:22 - your decisions
67:23 - what's going out there in the world
67:25 - right now what do people need what
67:26 - technologies are used the most
67:27 - and also what's easy for you to
67:29 - implement and learn so take all of that
67:31 - into account
67:32 - and guys we're at 1373 comments
67:36 - wow we're about to reach 1500 sorry
67:39 - likes in this video that is insane guys
67:41 - thank you so much we're at eighty nine
67:43 - dollars in chat donations so
67:45 - amazing thank you guys for sticking on
67:48 - amazing guys and if you're enjoying the
67:50 - content
67:50 - literally just smash the thumbs up
67:52 - button help get this video out to as
67:53 - many people as possible
67:55 - share it if you're watching it right now
67:56 - tag me in frankie
67:58 - on our instagram handles and let's carry
68:00 - on killing these guys
68:02 - so what we're going to do now is we have
68:05 - the sidebar component
68:06 - so the sidebar component over here what
68:09 - we're going to do
68:10 - is so the sidebar just pretty much
68:12 - consists
68:13 - of a bunch of rows right so if we go
68:16 - ahead and open up our app so
68:17 - literally over here you can see it's
68:18 - just a bunch of rows so you can see
68:20 - we've got here
68:21 - a row here a row here or here another
68:24 - row they're just rows so we
68:26 - why don't we create a component that we
68:28 - can reuse
68:29 - uh and we're going to call this
68:30 - component the sidebar row because
68:32 - naturally that seems like a good name so
68:34 - let's go ahead and do sidebar row
68:35 - and we can pass in different props to
68:37 - this to make it to go ahead and
68:38 - customize it
68:39 - we just got a nice donation from tech
68:41 - aftab thank you dude
68:43 - appreciate that thank you so much man
68:45 - appreciate it
68:46 - awesome dude so the sidebar
68:49 - row yeah so we're going to go ahead and
68:51 - create that now so sidebar also to
68:53 - create we're going to go ahead and do
68:54 - the following we're going to say
68:56 - create a file sidebar row dot js
69:00 - boom do rfce for a little shortcut
69:03 - boom and you see these guys these little
69:06 - shortcuts save you a bunch of time guys
69:08 - like otherwise this would take ages to
69:09 - slowly write this out and do all these
69:11 - little things
69:13 - and then here i'm going to do import
69:14 - sidebar
69:17 - row.css and which means we have to
69:19 - create that file so let's go ahead and
69:20 - create that
69:21 - so this builds quite intense today guys
69:23 - we've got a lot of stuff going on
69:24 - um and we have so much content coming in
69:27 - this build so we have react context api
69:29 - we have authentication we have
69:30 - deployment
69:31 - oh it gets more and more exciting long
69:34 - list
69:34 - let's go yeah it's insane
69:38 - nice so we have the sidebar row here so
69:42 - let's go ahead and pull that
69:43 - in to our sidebar right so let's go here
69:46 - do the following
69:47 - auto import it from sidebar row save the
69:50 - file
69:51 - and we should see now if we go ahead
69:53 - into our sidebar and say i
69:54 - am a row so let's just make a p tag and
69:57 - let's just say
69:58 - row and what we can do now is if we
70:01 - repeat this a few
70:02 - times we should be able to see it should
70:04 - say
70:05 - [Music]
70:07 - and i think what's happening is it's
70:09 - actually maybe
70:10 - not showing it
70:13 - so we can see sidebar row sidebar
70:16 - let's go ahead so i think right now it's
70:19 - because
70:23 - this is because we actually oh okay yep
70:25 - we don't actually show the sidebar
70:27 - so we need to go ahead and auto import
70:29 - the sidebar
70:30 - save it and now it should show the site
70:32 - but there we go we've got the rose
70:33 - coming in beautiful yeah coming up
70:36 - clutch
70:37 - exactly guys coming in close guys you
70:40 - know like no matter
70:41 - how experienced you are with code
70:43 - sometimes you're just gonna forget to
70:44 - import a few things you know so always
70:46 - make sure to check that
70:47 - always always always so we're finished
70:49 - with the header now we're working on the
70:51 - side row
70:52 - and we also got another donation wow
70:54 - aurora
70:55 - thank you so much for the indian rupees
70:57 - appreciate you so much she says
70:59 - or he says do i need to make html css
71:02 - skills
71:02 - super for react so i'll let you in a
71:05 - little secret
71:06 - when i started learning react my css
71:09 - skills
71:09 - sucked dude wow i they my apps looked so
71:13 - ugly when i started learning react but i
71:15 - focused on learning react and that's
71:17 - what i'm going to tell you guys
71:18 - focus on learning react and sort of the
71:21 - fundamentals behind it
71:22 - that's going to be a lot more important
71:23 - and then guys follow these builds like
71:25 - honestly follow every single one of
71:26 - these builds
71:27 - watch how your css will naturally get
71:29 - better through pattern recognition
71:31 - right so you're just going to notice
71:32 - different things you're going to see oh
71:34 - i see that's how flexbox works
71:36 - and before you know it things will start
71:38 - to sort of stick and you'll start to get
71:39 - better at css
71:41 - yeah ultimately it's you know the when
71:43 - you implement those practices so you're
71:45 - working on react and you're trying to
71:46 - make you know maybe the text blue or
71:48 - you're trying to make a sidebar or
71:49 - something like that
71:50 - then that's how you're going to pick up
71:51 - css by actually implementing by actually
71:54 - putting in that knowledge to work
71:56 - other than that if you're trying to
71:57 - learn the language of css man you're
71:58 - going to get confused it's more about
72:00 - learning where it goes and how to apply
72:02 - it exactly
72:03 - at least exactly that 100 i couldn't
72:06 - agree more guys like
72:07 - exactly what frankie said and remember
72:09 - that pattern recognition is so powerful
72:12 - that's going to really be a game changer
72:14 - so with that said
72:15 - the sidebar row component so
72:18 - let's go to the sidebar row component so
72:21 - inside of sidebar inside of the sidebar
72:23 - row now sidebar row
72:24 - can take a bunch of props so this is how
72:26 - we receive props inside of react now
72:28 - props what are they
72:29 - we can pretty much pass in different
72:31 - attributes so here if i passed in a
72:33 - title
72:33 - which said something like let's just say
72:36 - this one could be
72:37 - for example pages so at the top over
72:40 - here we have something like this where
72:41 - it says pages
72:42 - oh we just got another donation thank
72:44 - you very much that's a
72:46 - south african rant by dash oh nice say
72:49 - sonny
72:50 - he says it's because of guys like you we
72:52 - developers grow
72:54 - big thanks i love that that's amazing
72:57 - that makes our hearts so warm thank you
72:59 - man so much we're trying to build 5000
73:01 - developers
73:02 - trying to get them to get a job this
73:04 - year so
73:06 - you guys putting all of these projects
73:07 - in your portfolio applying to jobs
73:09 - are really helping us on that goal and
73:11 - we're here for you guys thank you
73:12 - yeah really really appreciate that dude
73:14 - and we love it like those comments just
73:16 - keep us going you know they keep the
73:18 - energy up they keep pushing us exactly
73:20 - love that so well here we have a title
73:23 - prop so here we would have pages friends
73:25 - messenger so yeah let's go ahead and
73:27 - implement that so just say something
73:28 - like pages
73:29 - um and then let's go ahead and pop in
73:32 - another one here so
73:33 - let's go like title equals
73:36 - uh friends so friends like such
73:39 - boom save it and now if we save this we
73:42 - should be able to see so the props
73:44 - instead of saying row what we could do
73:45 - is we could say props dot
73:47 - title and if we save that now over here
73:50 - we should actually see that we've got
73:51 - pages and friends
73:53 - so you see the ones where it's passed in
73:54 - it's rendering those and it shows that
73:56 - this has passed through as a prop what
73:57 - we can do to make this neater is we can
73:59 - destructure this so this is es6
74:02 - and we can basically pull out the title
74:03 - at this point so we no longer need to
74:04 - say props we could just pull it out of
74:06 - here and say title
74:08 - and that will still work so you see
74:09 - everything still works
74:12 - and yeah so what we're going to do is
74:14 - we're also going to upgrade this
74:15 - component so it accepts a few more
74:17 - things
74:17 - uh and we're going to change it to
74:19 - include the following so
74:21 - the we're going to have a source an icon
74:24 - and a title and i'll explain what these
74:26 - do so source icon and title
74:28 - so here you can see that we use for
74:31 - the top component over here we have um
74:35 - so for this one we have essentially so
74:37 - this component here
74:38 - we have an avatar so for the source it's
74:41 - going to be the user's
74:42 - image right so we can either pass that
74:44 - in or we can pass in
74:46 - an icon so if you pass in an icon it
74:49 - will come through like this
74:50 - so we're going to make our component
74:52 - extremely reasonable
74:53 - we also got another donation from enough
74:55 - aurora dude
74:56 - it's amazing like this kind of reading
74:59 - them
74:59 - i know it's like the third time he
75:01 - dropped something on this yeah on this
75:03 - specific live stream that's insane thank
75:04 - you so much manov we're also at 96
75:06 - dollars in donations guys hey
75:09 - let's go guys 100 mark that's going to

75:16 - wow we just got another donation another
75:19 - one
75:20 - hey caledon would say says
75:23 - gorov gorov says how to shift from
75:25 - angular to react
75:26 - love you guys my honest opinion dude is
75:29 - just start if you've done
75:31 - angular honestly when you start you'll
75:33 - be you'll be so amazed because you'll be
75:35 - like oh my god i didn't realize because
75:36 - angela has such a steep
75:38 - learning curve it's a framework so you
75:40 - have to do every single thing
75:42 - as they tell you to do it whereas react
75:44 - you only use
75:45 - things as you need it so as you need
75:47 - things you then you use it right so it's
75:49 - a lot easier to get into it
75:50 - my honest opinion follow these live
75:52 - streams literally you can go through
75:53 - every single live stream and you'll just
75:55 - get better and better and better and
75:56 - you'll pick up react by doing these live

78:03 - privilege to see like a lot of these
78:05 - guys go from
78:06 - absolute like in their beginner stages
78:08 - just to
78:09 - like frankie so how quickly have these
78:11 - guys turned into the developers like
78:13 - that they're doing stuff it's insane in
78:15 - a few months probably like three
78:17 - two months yeah something like that and
78:19 - now they're building crazy apps they're
78:20 - doing all this stuff like literally we
78:22 - jump on things it's insane like and you
78:24 - guys can be a part of that community
78:26 - as well so that's profit with javascript
78:28 - link is in the description
78:29 - and if you're on the fence with that
78:30 - free training guys there's a free
78:32 - training in the description so
78:34 - just sign up to that while you wait look
78:35 - at all that fire in the chats that's
78:37 - amazing and yeah for any of you that
78:39 - don't
78:40 - know shubham dropped it in the comments
78:41 - mirn is [ __ ]
78:43 - express react and node all put together
78:46 - into one text tag so we're going to be
78:48 - teaching
78:48 - all of that to you exactly so there's
78:51 - going to be some intense videos
78:53 - so make sure you get your sleep for
78:54 - those videos because it's going to be
78:55 - some exciting
78:56 - week next week that's awesome let's jump
78:58 - back into the build
79:00 - so we were working on the sidebar row
79:03 - so the sidebar row over here so let's go
79:06 - ahead and pull this
79:07 - out right now so the sidebar row
79:10 - let's go ahead and check this out so
79:12 - sidebarrow we have a few things that we
79:13 - want to pop in here so we want to say
79:15 - if there is a source so if we pass in
79:18 - the source prop
79:19 - then we're going to render out an avatar
79:21 - with the source being used as the source
79:23 - that we pop
79:24 - in uh so we need to go ahead and import
79:26 - the avatars which is this import
79:28 - statement over here
79:29 - and then we're going to say if you pass
79:31 - in an icon then we're going to
79:33 - then only then are we going to render
79:35 - out the icon
79:36 - right and this icon right here is not
79:38 - imported it's actually passed through as
79:40 - a prop
79:40 - right so whenever you pass a component
79:43 - as a prop so if many of you might have
79:45 - not realized that you could do that you
79:46 - can actually pass a component as a prop
79:48 - but you have to use a capital letter
79:50 - otherwise it won't work if i change this
79:52 - to a lowercase i
79:53 - it will actually break so if i go ahead
79:54 - and do this it doesn't work you see it
79:57 - changes the color and that actually
79:58 - breaks everything from working so
80:00 - it's a convention inside of reactor
80:02 - capital i which is why
80:03 - also all of our file names are using
80:05 - their components have capital letters
80:07 - so something to to know if you didn't
80:10 - know that so
80:10 - yash kendall says are using redux for
80:13 - this
80:14 - we're using the react context api and
80:15 - we're going to be using that in today's
80:17 - build so keep tuning stay tuned
80:19 - and smash the thumbs up if you're
80:20 - excited for that so
80:22 - so now what we're going to do is we have
80:24 - a rather than a p
80:26 - tag i'm going to use a h4 wait hold on
80:28 - whoa
80:30 - 1550 likes on this video
80:32 - insane guys oh my god thank you so much
80:35 - cp family
80:36 - clever programmer family damn you guys
80:38 - surprised us every freaking
80:39 - live stream thank you so much and it's
80:41 - just growing
80:43 - seriously dude like it's actually insane
80:46 - down nice so let's go ahead and we've
80:50 - got these three things in here right now
80:52 - so these three different things so what
80:53 - we're gonna do is we're gonna actually
80:54 - go ahead and pass in
80:56 - a bunch of props so we actually have
80:58 - some they data available for us
81:00 - so let's go ahead and do that so let's
81:02 - go to our
81:03 - sidebar over here and let's go ahead and
81:06 - pass in some dummy props so here
81:08 - we have a bunch of icons being passed in
81:10 - so we need to import those
81:12 - so let's go ahead and do that let's
81:14 - import those
81:15 - at the top and then you can see here so
81:18 - this one right here
81:20 - we actually don't have a source so we
81:21 - don't have this yet
81:23 - and we don't have the user's display
81:25 - name yet so at this point i'm just going
81:27 - to say the user is sonny sanger
81:29 - and the source let's go ahead and i've
81:31 - actually got a image on google so let's
81:33 - go ahead and do sony
81:34 - saying uh i'm going to grab this image
81:37 - quickly so we can just see
81:39 - boom we can copy the image address
81:43 - and then i'll come back to the app there
81:46 - we go
81:46 - and here we can do this so that's just
81:49 - an image right there and what this will
81:51 - do guys is it says expand more outline
81:53 - is not defined so we need to go ahead
81:55 - and import that as well
81:56 - boom like so and what this will do
81:59 - now is it should pop out those sidebar
82:02 - components onto
82:03 - the page so if we save this we refresh
82:06 - we should see
82:07 - those components pop in
82:10 - um there's a little bit of a delay there
82:12 - but it should pop in any second
82:14 - so once that's done what we're going to
82:16 - do is we're going to actually go to our
82:17 - sidebar
82:18 - row and we're going to start styling
82:20 - this thing so let's go to our sidebar
82:21 - row.css
82:23 - and let's go ahead and see first you'll
82:25 - see why that's not actually working
82:27 - maybe it's compiling
82:28 - there we go it's compiling sometimes it
82:29 - gets held up it's completely fine if it
82:31 - does that just carry on developing
82:33 - um and you can come back to it when it
82:35 - works so we go to our sidebar row.css
82:38 - and here what i'm going to do is i'm
82:39 - going to say displayflex so
82:41 - what you can do when this happens guys
82:43 - you can press con
82:44 - control c npm start so that will cancel
82:47 - that and it will rerun it again
82:50 - right so i'll rerun it again and that
82:52 - should kickstart it again so that
82:54 - sometimes helps
82:55 - if it gets stuck beautiful what is that
82:57 - shortcut that you use to
82:59 - you know go to choose you know like
83:01 - sidebar row css and all of that
83:03 - to search on it good shot that's command
83:06 - p so command p
83:07 - pops open this such and if you do
83:09 - command p command p again
83:11 - you see you can go back to your previous
83:12 - file which is really handy and if you
83:14 - keep tapping it you can go down a file
83:16 - which is awesome and then you can
83:17 - actually type in there so if i want the
83:19 - sidebar row
83:20 - then i can just go down and hit enter so
83:22 - that's how i navigate really quick
83:24 - beautiful yeah that's really really cool
83:27 - um so i'm not sure why this is
83:28 - okay there we go we're back people are
83:30 - saying some path is saying
83:31 - next mark zuckerberg is sunny hey
83:35 - not too far off nice dude yeah hopefully
83:38 - i mean
83:38 - we'll see hopefully we get that
83:40 - zuckerberg paycheck
83:42 - yeah let's go nice
83:46 - so now guys you see it looks like this
83:49 - which is not exactly how we want the app
83:51 - to look right
83:52 - so what we're going to do is we're going
83:53 - to target the sidebar row
83:55 - and we're basically going to go ahead
83:57 - and add the following display flex
83:58 - align item center padding at 10 pixels
84:01 - and change it to a cursor pointer
84:03 - so the minute we do that you see
84:04 - everything goes into a nice little view
84:07 - there and we pretty much get this
84:09 - pointer uh cursor which looks a lot
84:11 - cleaner
84:12 - all right then what we're going to do is
84:13 - we want so when we hover over it the
84:15 - background color is going to go light
84:16 - gray and a border radius of 10 pixels is
84:18 - applied
84:19 - so if we do that now you can see we get
84:21 - that border radius you can see it's a
84:22 - very subtle border radius at the end
84:24 - and you get that hovering over effect
84:27 - the next thing we're going to do is
84:28 - target that h4 which is the
84:30 - text inside we're going to say margin
84:32 - left of 20 pixels so now it no longer
84:34 - pushes next to it i'm going to say a
84:35 - font weight of 600
84:36 - so it changes the boldness of that and
84:39 - then
84:40 - we are going to change the color of the
84:42 - icons and the
84:44 - size of the icon so to do that we're
84:45 - going to go inside the sidebar we'll say
84:47 - the direct child
84:48 - remember this is what the icons get
84:50 - given as a class name by default
84:52 - we're going to change the font size to
84:54 - extra extra large and we're going to
84:55 - color the facebook blue
84:57 - and with that look at that looks really
84:59 - really slick and we've got a nice
85:01 - looking um we've got a nice looking
85:04 - sidebar component so responsive i love
85:07 - it
85:08 - yeah it's really really clean right um i
85:11 - just want to address this one as well so
85:12 - uh nitin thank you so much he says sunny
85:14 - is react probably makes things look so
85:16 - easy
85:16 - honestly dude i really appreciate that
85:18 - but trust me there was a point in time
85:20 - where like i was also
85:21 - in a i was also a beginner and i was
85:23 - learning and i was very
85:25 - you know like very sort of stuck and
85:26 - things like that and also somebody else
85:28 - just said
85:29 - no bugs in your builds as good uh as a
85:32 - good as a developer it feels so good
85:33 - oh awesome so he's i think he means when
85:35 - he's following along but guys i'll tell
85:37 - you when i'm actually prepping the build
85:38 - i do run into a gazillion bugs so like
85:41 - if you run into bugs as well
85:42 - it's completely normal obviously we do
85:45 - prepare
85:45 - in advance so the live streams can be
85:47 - super super uh seamless
85:49 - but it's a normal thing to get stuck
85:51 - right it's another thing to get stuck
85:52 - just don't quit do not quit isn't that
85:54 - right frankie like
85:55 - that persistence yeah it's the best way
85:58 - to learn man from your mistakes from
86:00 - other people's mistakes like i mentioned
86:01 - on the last live stream
86:02 - it is true bugs are gonna bugs are gonna
86:05 - be your greatest teachers probably most
86:06 - likely and
86:08 - yeah i love seeing faces familiar faces
86:10 - like the greatest ever thank you man for
86:12 - being here
86:13 - i love it you're always on the live
86:14 - streams man bringing in the positivity
86:16 - that's really what we want from you guys
86:18 - and we're going to teach you all that we
86:19 - know thank you so much
86:21 - exactly thank you so much guys awesome
86:24 - so let's go and
86:28 - continue on so we have the sidebar row
86:30 - completed
86:31 - now the sidebar itself is actually
86:33 - complete which means that we can go
86:35 - ahead
86:36 - back to app.js and we can get rid of our
86:39 - little annotation
86:40 - nice so what we're going to do now is
86:43 - we're actually going to go ahead and add
86:44 - in
86:45 - the feed right so the feed now the feed
86:48 - is the juicy part it's pretty much where
86:50 - we have
86:51 - all of so everything inside of the
86:53 - center of the page is the feed so
86:56 - uh every oops everything inside of the
86:58 - center of the page so everything you see
87:00 - here
87:00 - is the feed so this middle component is
87:03 - the feed and that's where we're going to
87:04 - pretty much have
87:05 - all of this component sitting right now
87:08 - right
87:09 - so and you can also see oh damn it's got
87:11 - me and frankie come up in the uh
87:12 - the little widget that we built somebody
87:16 - asked
87:16 - somebody asked if if it gates if that
87:19 - specific sidebar gets updated what are
87:21 - we calling that right sidebar sony
87:23 - uh yeah so this is the widgets yeah the
87:25 - right type
87:26 - yeah exactly so yep sunny says that we
87:29 - use iframes for that right sony
87:31 - yeah so this is actually an iframe and
87:33 - it's pulling the information uh
87:35 - live from facebook so that's actually
87:36 - working dynamically yeah
87:38 - yep that's the real clever programmer
87:40 - website that's where it's getting that
87:41 - information that's awesome man
87:43 - exactly yeah really really cool nice so
87:46 - now what we're going to do is we're
87:47 - going to actually go ahead and make this
87:49 - perfect size there we go
87:51 - and we are going to go ahead and build
87:52 - out the feed component so let's go ahead
87:54 - and do that
87:57 - so what we need to do is create the
87:59 - feed.js so feed.js
88:02 - do rfce save like that
88:06 - class name of feed so let's go ahead and
88:08 - do class name of
88:09 - feed and let's go ahead and import so to
88:13 - import
88:15 - feed.css like such right so that's
88:18 - awesome
88:19 - and then we also need to create the
88:21 - feed.css file
88:23 - oopsfeed.css like so and now
88:26 - we have the import at the top and we can
88:27 - pretty much start building out the feed
88:29 - so
88:30 - the feed let's go ahead and check out so
88:33 - the feed what we have here is we have a
88:35 - few things right so
88:36 - let's go ahead and do our tactic that we
88:38 - like doing
88:40 - uh where we pretty much mask things out
88:42 - right so in this middle section
88:44 - we have this beautiful story real
88:47 - like this this story rail that we see at
88:49 - the top right
88:50 - so this story rail right here pretty
88:52 - much is what we're gonna write here so
88:54 - that's going to be its own component so
88:56 - this one is going to be called
88:57 - the story real right and the next
89:01 - component underneath that is going to be
89:02 - what we call the message
89:03 - sender component right and thank you
89:06 - saeed imran
89:07 - for another super chat awesome dude and
89:11 - oh wow oh nice check this out
89:14 - again wow thank you so much man he says
89:17 - this is for frankie to capture senior
89:19 - deb chair hey
89:21 - let's go man this chair is awesome i'm
89:23 - still getting used to it i don't know
89:24 - about this pillow
89:25 - but it's it's pretty good man at least
89:27 - um i get my back straight
89:29 - so do you guys so much it's like you
89:30 - guys got paired up and dropping the
89:32 - donation at the same time
89:33 - we love that thank you yeah yeah exactly
89:35 - i love it's weird how that happens right
89:37 - like everyone
89:38 - everyone always doubles yeah yeah it's
89:41 - insane
89:42 - all right so then we're gonna have the
89:43 - message sender component so the message
89:45 - sender component i'm referring to this
89:48 - so that's we're gonna call that the
89:49 - message sender um
89:51 - yeah so let's go ahead and build out the
89:53 - so firstly it's complaining now because
89:55 - it's saying feed is not defined so
89:57 - let's go back into oh i just don't want
89:59 - to save that one let's go back into
90:01 - app.js
90:02 - and let's go ahead and import this so
90:04 - import feed from feed so there we go
90:07 - uh back into feed save this file and
90:09 - this hide so we clean things up
90:11 - so here we're going to basically have a
90:13 - story real component so this is going to
90:14 - be something like this
90:15 - it's going to say story real like so
90:19 - and we save it and now it's going to
90:21 - freak out because it's like oh well
90:23 - we don't have a story real component so
90:24 - storyrod.js we need to create
90:27 - once we go in here rfce
90:30 - do it like this and then we're going to
90:33 - go ahead and create a class name so a
90:34 - class name of story
90:36 - real remember naming convention camel
90:38 - casing right here
90:40 - and then we're going to do import story
90:42 - rail so story
90:44 - real like so dot css save it
90:47 - create the css file so story real.css
90:51 - boom
90:52 - we have it and then we're back so now we
90:54 - have this stuff
90:55 - ready to go so the story rail pretty
90:58 - much consists of
90:59 - you can imagine right so where we have
91:02 - that story real
91:03 - we have several oops i always do that by
91:07 - mistake
91:07 - we have several uh stories inside of it
91:10 - so you guessed it
91:11 - these are also components these are
91:13 - going to be story components
91:14 - and we're just gonna pass in props and
91:16 - we're gonna render it out differently
91:18 - based on which prop we pass in
91:20 - so you see like this is the beauty
91:22 - behind react guys like it's it's why
91:24 - react is so powerful
91:25 - it's why i love react it's why like i
91:27 - just just don't waste your time letting
91:29 - anything else just spend it
91:31 - you learning reacting it's just so
91:32 - powerful how we're going to do this
91:34 - so the goal here is to have essentially
91:37 - a few different stories like so
91:39 - um syed imran just dropped another
91:42 - donation
91:43 - nice dude wow i've just learned html
91:46 - csc i mean i think he means css
91:49 - js what's next react is next bro
91:53 - go ahead and follow these tutorials man
91:55 - i think that's the next step for you for
91:56 - sure
91:57 - yeah 100 reacted react
92:00 - nice and thank you for the donation
92:03 - again thank you bro
92:04 - all right so we're going to have this
92:06 - story component several times and we're
92:07 - going to pass in different props right
92:09 - so now what i'm going to do is create a
92:11 - story.js so story.js
92:14 - rfce and boom
92:17 - we get that and here i'm going to say
92:18 - class name
92:20 - of story so like so and at the top we're
92:23 - going to say import
92:26 - story.css story.css which
92:29 - means you guessed it we have to create
92:31 - the story.css file
92:33 - right so you see once you get faster
92:34 - doing that it becomes very quick
92:36 - to do that step right and that's going
92:38 - to be something which you do want to get
92:39 - speed
92:40 - up use things like snippets to make it
92:41 - faster those tasks we don't want to
92:43 - spend too much time on when to spend
92:44 - time on the juicy stuff
92:46 - right so let's go into the story now the
92:48 - story is going to have
92:50 - the props passed in at this point here
92:52 - right now we're going to destructure
92:54 - this prop
92:55 - these props at this point and we're
92:56 - going to pull a few things right so
92:58 - we're going to pull
92:59 - we have an image here so we have the
93:01 - actual image so you see the background
93:03 - image
93:03 - that's going to be an image so we're
93:05 - going to have that so we're going to say
93:06 - image
93:07 - then we actually go ahead and we have a
93:09 - two things we have
93:11 - this uh sort of profile picture so this
93:13 - one right here
93:15 - right this profile picture right here

94:27 - as far damn that's love that dude
94:30 - love that let's keep this energy going
94:32 - guys so
94:34 - we have the story which takes three
94:37 - props it has image
94:38 - it has profile source and title so we're
94:40 - gonna have a few things inside of here
94:42 - right we're gonna have an avatar and the
94:43 - avatar is gonna be the avatar that you
94:45 - see
94:46 - on the right and that's going to take
94:48 - you guessed it here's the source
94:50 - but we're going to use the profile
94:51 - source as the
94:53 - input for that avatar so that should
94:55 - actually go ahead and pop in the
94:57 - person's picture
94:59 - so there we go and then we're going to
95:00 - have a h4
95:02 - which is going to have the title that we
95:04 - pass in right
95:06 - now for the background image so for this
95:09 - background image
95:10 - what we're going to do is and also to
95:11 - make this very easy to understand and
95:13 - see what we're going to do is where we
95:14 - have the story real
95:15 - let's go ahead and actually just render
95:17 - out a few of these components so let's
95:18 - go ahead and go back to our story realm
95:21 - and now what i've done here guys i've
95:23 - saved you a bunch of hassle
95:24 - and i've gone ahead and i've just
95:26 - created a few component calls here
95:28 - with the correct props so i'm going to
95:31 - quickly
95:32 - make this full screen for a second so
95:33 - you guys can go ahead and pause the
95:34 - video and look at these
95:36 - so you guys can see that we also need to
95:38 - import the story
95:39 - there we go and i'm going to go ahead
95:41 - and pop that back
95:42 - to the side and basically these are some
95:44 - dummy props i've
95:45 - gone ahead and and sort of put out to
95:48 - save you a bit of time
95:49 - now we have that let's go back into uh
95:52 - it says inside of feed
95:54 - the story row is not defined so we need
95:55 - to import that boom save it
95:58 - and then it should start working again
96:00 - there we go
96:01 - so now the story we can see okay nice we
96:04 - can see each of the different
96:06 - uh each of us we've got sunny me frankie
96:09 - obviously we've got me quasi frankie
96:12 - aaron and nars
96:13 - right now for the background of the div
96:16 - i actually want to set that as the image
96:18 - that we pass
96:19 - in right so i want to actually
96:23 - i actually want to make that uh the
96:25 - image that we passed in yeah i know i
96:26 - just read that
96:27 - yeah me too i saw frank saying don't
96:30 - scroll down i think we made non
96:31 - non-suitable for workbook by mistake
96:33 - damn it guys keep it clean we don't want
96:35 - to
96:35 - bring it bring that website down because
96:37 - of you guys everybody wants to learn we
96:39 - want to see it
96:40 - you know function so keep it clean guys
96:43 - exactly keep that clean guys
96:45 - um so at the div at this point so
96:48 - for the div what we're going to do is we
96:50 - are going to go inside
96:52 - and it's it's also funny that sunny for
96:54 - my picture he put jeff bezos because i'm
96:56 - freaking bald as well
96:58 - he said he couldn't look at my he
96:59 - couldn't find my picture i was
97:01 - like yeah i'm probably rich you know i
97:04 - didn't even realize until
97:06 - uh sheila pointed it out that he was
97:08 - both because i didn't actually pick it
97:09 - because he was well i was like yo here's
97:10 - a badass like that because i couldn't
97:12 - find a picture of frankie
97:13 - and i just thought about that jeff bezos
97:15 - is a badass then i realized
97:20 - subconscious yeah oh man
97:23 - so now guys we're going to use something
97:26 - called an inline style so you can start
97:28 - with css but you can also style
97:30 - inline and here what you do is you pass
97:32 - in an object in your jsx
97:34 - like this and you would do background
97:36 - image so it's not usually we're used to
97:37 - something like this but in when you do
97:39 - it this way
97:40 - you do it in a camel casing fashion and
97:42 - here we're going to use backticks i'm
97:43 - going to say go to a url
97:44 - and that url is going to be the image
97:47 - that we pass in
97:48 - right so with that said now this should
97:50 - actually set the background image of
97:52 - this div so each of these divs
97:54 - to the image that we passed in so if i
97:55 - save that now we should see
97:59 - we should see the background images you
98:01 - see that nice we actually get the
98:02 - background images
98:04 - uh pop in so we're gonna make this look
98:07 - like
98:08 - what we see in the react app so this
98:10 - right we're gonna make it even with the
98:11 - hover functionality so
98:13 - you're gonna see how we can go from that
98:15 - to that which is just some
98:16 - css changes so hopping into
98:20 - the story.css the first thing we're
98:22 - going to do is also for this avatar
98:24 - what we're going to do is we're going to
98:25 - give it a class name of story under
98:27 - squad underscore avatar to make it
98:29 - easier to target that
98:30 - yes we can target the uh class that
98:32 - material ui gives it but it's kind of
98:34 - easier to do it this way
98:36 - so we're going to go ahead and save and
98:37 - then we're going to go inside inside of
98:39 - story.css like so
98:41 - inside of here now what we're going to
98:43 - do inside of here is we're going to go
98:45 - and do the following so this is a few
98:47 - rules
98:48 - so get ready for this one guys so the
98:50 - first one
98:51 - is we're going to say target the story
98:53 - containers the outer container
98:55 - and we're first going to do position
98:58 - relative so that way when we do absolute
99:00 - positioning with the child components
99:01 - they're going to be relative
99:02 - to this parent so that's something which
99:05 - is very important and you should check
99:06 - it out
99:07 - a few people are saying styled
99:08 - components yes we will actually be using
99:10 - style components in some future builds
99:12 - because i love style components as well
99:13 - and i do use them in some of my builds
99:15 - so the first thing we're going to do is
99:17 - background position center center
99:19 - background size cover background repeat
99:23 - no repeat so what this will do is it
99:25 - should center the images now you see
99:26 - some of them are
99:27 - being repeated now so if i save this we
99:30 - should go ahead and see
99:32 - that it doesn't happen anymore it
99:33 - doesn't repeat it just kind of it still
99:35 - looks weird but we're going to go ahead
99:36 - and fix that with a width and a height
99:38 - so let's go ahead and drop in a width
99:40 - and a height of 120 pixels 200
99:42 - uh height there we go so now you can see
99:44 - that sort of card
99:46 - dimension coming into play then what
99:48 - we're going to do is we're going to add
99:49 - a box shadow so box shadow will give it
99:51 - that nice 3d effect
99:53 - so let's go ahead and add that in and
99:55 - now you can see
99:56 - guys i'm seeing that there's a little
99:58 - bit of flashes on sonny's screen right
100:00 - now
100:00 - am i the only one looking at that or can
100:02 - you guys see it also just
100:03 - just so we know thank you just drop it
100:05 - in the comments below if you guys are
100:06 - experiencing that it's not
100:08 - something too overwhelming but i just
100:09 - figured it out let me know oh yeah i can
100:12 - see that actually
100:14 - uh maybe let me go ahead and go back to
100:16 - the screen so let's see if that works
100:17 - so maybe that's better yeah
100:21 - nice but if that does happen guys i
100:23 - would apologize for that i'm not sure
100:25 - why that's happening
100:26 - um we'll try to we'll try our best to
100:27 - fix it for sure and guys we just
100:30 - crap we just crossed 1 700 likes on this
100:33 - video let's go
100:34 - there's so many people hey some people
100:37 - are saying i see the flashing too we can
100:39 - see it we can see it awesome yeah we'll
100:40 - try to get that fixed for you guys
100:42 - we just got another discount dude
100:44 - another sorry a
100:45 - donation it says
100:49 - is there any student discount for profit
100:51 - with javascript course how old is the
100:53 - content of the course
100:55 - so thank you an answer yep so
100:58 - discounts for students no man right now
101:01 - we don't
101:02 - and that's really for a reason too man
101:04 - it's it's it is an investment it will be
101:06 - an investment on your part
101:07 - because you're investing in yourself and
101:08 - ultimately you know that's the best
101:10 - thing that you can do if you're starting
101:11 - off with your career and really with
101:13 - your life
101:13 - it is really a shortcut so it's going to
101:15 - be very worth it man the
101:17 - old the age of the course is very very
101:19 - recent we started developing it in late
101:22 - december 2019 to this point we're still
101:25 - putting in new modules so
101:26 - nas just finished uh what was it a
101:28 - google chrome extension
101:30 - i think like last week so he's about to
101:31 - shoot that so it's still in development
101:33 - just because new technologies are
101:34 - arising and everything it is
101:36 - very very relevant and it's top of the
101:38 - line
101:39 - so it is completely worth it thank you
101:42 - so much for your donation man
101:44 - yeah exactly and guys what i will say is
101:46 - the price right now is actually
101:48 - discounted for everyone so the price
101:50 - you're seeing right now
101:52 - is going to be only a limited price
101:55 - very soon we're going to have a
101:56 - challenge we're going to be doing a
101:57 - react challenge
101:58 - and once we do that challenge guys the
102:00 - price goes up and it stays up
102:02 - so once that price goes up guys it does
102:04 - not come back down again
102:06 - all right so we like if you if what i
102:09 - would say is go ahead and check out that
102:10 - price right now
102:11 - and make sure if you're on the fence
102:12 - just remember that it will go up in in
102:14 - maybe in like three weeks time two weeks
102:16 - time
102:16 - so don't miss out because once it goes
102:19 - back uh up you're not going to get it
102:20 - back at the price you're seeing it at
102:21 - now
102:22 - yeah man you don't want it to go up if
102:24 - you don't have the money right now tell
102:25 - your mom tell your friends tell your
102:26 - father tell
102:27 - everybody anybody you know that can help
102:29 - you with your development that's going
102:31 - to completely
102:32 - you know help your life it's going to be
102:33 - completely worth it for you and
102:35 - actually frank says sonny's crushing it
102:37 - crushing the code too hard the monitor
102:39 - can't keep up
102:40 - hey
102:46 - anymore so i think we got rid of that
102:48 - yeah see it's funny because when i stop
102:50 - coding it's like whoa we can breathe
102:54 - nice so there we go so now what i'm
102:57 - going to do is i'm going to go ahead and
102:59 - do this so border radius of 10 pixels
103:01 - margin right 10 pixels
103:02 - and this right here so this will
103:05 - actually change it to a pointer cursor
103:07 - so we get that
103:08 - and then this will actually prepare it
103:09 - so that we get that nice animation
103:12 - in a second so to get that animation
103:14 - what we do is we add the following we
103:15 - say
103:16 - story hover like so right we do this now
103:19 - what this does guys is can you see it
103:21 - actually hovers
103:22 - as i hover over it grows and this is
103:24 - scaling to seven percent bigger so this
103:26 - is one
103:27 - and seven percent so it's like seven
103:29 - percent scale so that's what we do when
103:31 - we do this
103:32 - now the transition here is saying make
103:35 - that transform last 100 milliseconds and
103:37 - ease in the transition so
103:38 - here you can see that we get a very nice
103:40 - ease in transition effect
103:42 - so that's going to be another donation
103:45 - dude
103:47 - and amazing dude we're at 114 in chat
103:50 - donations right now thank you so much
103:52 - carlos

103:54 - afraid to clone big websites
103:57 - muchas gracias thank you so much man we
104:00 - really appreciate that
104:02 - 50 mexican pesos thank you that's dope
104:04 - dude
104:05 - yo like that man spanish is so sick
104:10 - i think it's the coolest language it
104:11 - just sounds cool he said
104:13 - yeah i love it it's kind of it's kind of
104:15 - a sexy language and also if you know
104:16 - spanish you can also learn portuguese
104:18 - really easily a little bit of french
104:20 - italian too so all of those romance
104:23 - languages
104:24 - thank you thank you that's nice dude
104:26 - right the next thing we're going to do
104:27 - is target the avatar right so that
104:29 - little avatar that we see we're going to
104:30 - do
104:31 - margin 10 pixels and we're going to do a
104:33 - border around it which is like the
104:34 - little blue border
104:36 - and then the final thing to style here
104:38 - is that h4
104:39 - tag inside of it right so we're going to
104:41 - go ahead and make it absolute
104:42 - positioning
104:42 - but because we set the parent to
104:44 - relative it's going to be absolute
104:46 - within the parent container
104:48 - so we're going to say bottom and left of
104:51 - 20 pixels and then the color will be
104:52 - white so now you can see we've got this
104:54 - nice
104:54 - effect right we've got this nice
104:55 - finished little effect and you can see
104:57 - guys
104:58 - this is actually looking a lot like the
105:00 - actual app it's just the layout
105:02 - it's different yeah it looks beautiful
105:04 - it looked it looked super big
105:05 - once you when you implemented it at
105:08 - first but now that you
105:09 - fix this it looks just like the facebook
105:11 - app it's amazing
105:12 - and also pranav left another donation of
105:15 - 40 indian rupees thank you so much man
105:17 - he says
105:17 - waiting for mern whatsapp clone keep it
105:19 - up thank you man yeah stay tuned for
105:21 - that sonny and david are going to kill
105:23 - it next week with those builds
105:24 - and yeah you're going to learn a lot
105:26 - from it the mern stack the most
105:28 - right now demanded stack for us so
105:30 - exactly
105:31 - thank you awesome that is all coming
105:33 - next week so exciting stuff for you guys
105:36 - so with that said we have the story
105:38 - pretty much done so now we're gonna go
105:40 - into our story reel
105:42 - and we're gonna go ahead and style this
105:43 - so it looks the way we want it to look
105:45 - so
105:46 - what we're going to do here is we're
105:47 - going to go over to our story real.css
105:49 - and all we need to do here is very
105:51 - simple actually guys we just need to do
105:52 - a story roll
105:53 - um over here we need to do story real
105:56 - and what we do is display flex right so
105:59 - as soon as i hit
105:59 - save on that boom it goes into a row so
106:02 - you see that we get a nice little row
106:03 - going on right and then what we want to
106:05 - do is we're going to go ahead and do the
106:08 - following so each of these
106:09 - should also have a little margin next to
106:12 - them so we're going to go ahead and say
106:13 - each of the stories
106:14 - should have a little margin next to them
106:17 - actually we got rid of that sorry we
106:18 - don't need to
106:19 - we just need to say display flex there
106:21 - we go happy days
106:22 - nice so with that said now we have the
106:25 - sidebar and we have this
106:26 - right here now obviously this doesn't
106:28 - look this doesn't look right because
106:29 - everything's sort of like
106:30 - positioned incorrectly so let's go back
106:33 - to our app.css and we're going to make
106:34 - some tweaks over here
106:35 - so that we get the positioning correct
106:38 - as we want it
106:38 - so if we go back to app.js we notice
106:40 - that everything is inside of app body we
106:42 - have the sidebar the feed and the
106:43 - widgets
106:44 - so everything that you see here in terms
106:47 - of the fill
106:47 - full build you have these three sections
106:50 - you have the
106:51 - um oops not that one sorry we have
106:54 - this over here so we have the um the
106:57 - sidebar
106:58 - the feed and these widgets right
107:01 - so these are very very important to take
107:03 - note of right now so we have those
107:05 - things
107:05 - inside here and what we're going to do
107:07 - is we're going to style it so they
107:08 - actually sit next to each other so right
107:10 - now they're obviously
107:10 - stacking on top of each other because
107:12 - inside of our body by default
107:14 - it's uh by default it's um
107:19 - it's display block okay now let's go
107:22 - ahead and go to
107:23 - app.css and let's go ahead and do the
107:26 - following we're going to say app body
107:28 - app body and we're going to say display
107:31 - flex right so display flex like this
107:34 - save it boom and you should be able to
107:36 - see now
107:37 - that boom it goes next to it right so we
107:40 - actually get that nice
107:41 - behavior right there so it goes very
107:43 - nicely like that
107:44 - we're also going to make the background
107:46 - of the app turn to the gray that
107:48 - facebook has
107:50 - so if we do that and then the header had
107:52 - a background of white so you should
107:53 - actually
107:54 - stick out so now you can see however big
107:56 - the app is it will show us
107:57 - the background of it and what we could
107:59 - do for now just to make sure that we can
108:01 - see the entire app covered is we can say
108:03 - a height of 100
108:04 - view height and we can get rid of this
108:05 - afterwards so there we go
108:07 - so you can see we've got that looking
108:08 - pretty sweet now what we're going to do
108:11 - to continue on with that is we're going
108:13 - to make this a little bit bigger so we
108:14 - can see it the entire thing there we go
108:16 - we're going to go ahead and jump into so
108:19 - that's that component done for now
108:21 - which is clean what we're going to now
108:23 - do is actually have it
108:25 - so that let's go ahead and check
108:29 - something quickly so
108:33 - where did we render these story rows
108:35 - inside of feed
108:37 - so in feed and what we're going to do
108:38 - guys is feed let's go ahead and start
108:40 - feed a little bit as well because feed
108:42 - we should actually have some padding and
108:44 - stuff like that because right now it's
108:45 - kind of scrunched up to the top
108:46 - right so the feed i want it to have
108:48 - precedence i want to say flex 1 so it
108:50 - should
108:51 - try and take up as much room as it
108:52 - possibly can i'm then going to add some
108:54 - padding i'm going to say 30 pixels
108:57 - on the top and bottom 150 on the left
108:59 - and right then we'll say display flex so
109:01 - anything
109:02 - any child inside of it should now go
109:04 - into a
109:05 - column flex direction and then we're
109:07 - going to say justify content seller
109:09 - align items
109:10 - center so as soon as we save that not
109:12 - this page sorry oops
109:14 - now we should actually see that it
109:15 - spaces things out a little bit
109:17 - so that's a lot cleaner and it looks a
109:19 - lot better in that sense
109:21 - so we actually get this at the moment um
109:24 - and it looks a bit strange for now
109:25 - because i think we haven't
109:27 - done the sidebar all right so i need to
109:28 - go ahead and also start the sidebar
109:31 - and for the sidebar i'm just going to do
109:33 - a flex
109:34 - of 0.33 and i'm going to say padding
109:37 - of 25 pixels and this right here 10
109:40 - pixels
109:42 - all right so right now it's aligning
109:43 - center because it only has this one
109:45 - child
109:46 - but once we put more children in it it
109:47 - will align it centrally
109:49 - like such right so that's why we see it
109:51 - like this but for now it's actually
109:53 - looking pretty clean
109:54 - like it's doing pretty good right so
109:56 - amazing yeah
109:57 - yeah so everything's looking pretty
109:59 - clean and now what we're going to do
110:01 - guys
110:02 - is we are going to go to the
110:06 - i'm going to get rid of this comment so
110:08 - the comments actually help you figure
110:09 - out and actually help me even figure out
110:11 - what we're doing next
110:12 - so message sender is next so what we're
110:15 - going to do is inside a feed
110:16 - let's go ahead and check out so message
110:18 - sender refers to
110:20 - this right here guys so this part right
110:23 - here
110:24 - so this component right here oops that
110:26 - was horrible
110:27 - talk about this one here yeah so this
110:30 - right here is the message
110:31 - sender component and this is going to be
110:32 - responsible for how you essentially push
110:35 - some messages out onto the platform so
110:38 - let's go ahead and do message
110:39 - pretty much make posts huh yeah exactly
110:43 - here's how you're gonna post things so
110:45 - let's go ahead and create that file so
110:47 - message sender
110:48 - message oops message sender.js boom
110:52 - rfce go ahead and do this rfce
110:56 - like so let's go ahead and do oops div
110:59 - give it a class name of message sender
111:01 - so message
111:03 - sender like that let's go ahead and do
111:05 - import
111:08 - message sender.css like so
111:12 - and now inside of here what we're going
111:13 - to do is we are going to have a few
111:16 - things so
111:17 - this one actually is broken down quite
111:19 - into a sort of complicated sort of
111:21 - more complicated structure so here we
111:24 - have a few things that we need to take
111:26 - note of right
111:27 - we have the let's go ahead and make this
111:29 - smaller so
111:30 - we have a few things we have the header
111:33 - top
111:34 - so this is the header top and then we
111:36 - have the header bottom
111:37 - and then inside of here we have a few
111:40 - things
111:40 - that we're going to do with containers
111:42 - that allow us to achieve this design
111:44 - right so what we're going to do is we're
111:46 - going to draft it out here so we're
111:47 - going to create a div and this the first
111:48 - div is going to be message sender
111:51 - underscore top so it's going to be the
111:53 - top section and then the next one is
111:55 - going to be
111:56 - message sender dot bottom so message
111:59 - sender bottom so it's gonna be the
112:01 - bottom stuff
112:02 - over there now inside the top we're
112:04 - gonna have a few things we're gonna
112:06 - first have an avatar so it's gonna have
112:07 - an avatar so this is gonna refer to the
112:09 - avatar that you see
112:10 - on the right right so this is actually
112:14 - gonna refer to
112:15 - this avatar right here so this one right
112:18 - here
112:20 - and then we're going to be able to call
112:21 - that same avatar from the beginning
112:23 - right when you put it in the
112:24 - header to begin with yes so
112:28 - that avatar is the same component right
112:30 - now
112:31 - we're not actually passing in and we got
112:33 - somebody here
112:34 - guys who is this guy oh oh my god

113:36 - nice
113:38 - dope dude
113:53 - you'll be sitting with me yeah you were
113:54 - working with the avatar honestly
113:56 - yeah so we're working with the avatar
113:57 - component so we had
113:59 - over here the avatar component and
114:02 - that is let's go ahead oh i didn't
114:04 - actually make you guys full screen there
114:06 - we go guys
114:06 - how you know you can see kazi then nice
114:11 - so let's go ahead and carry on so we had
114:13 - the uh message sender component
114:15 - so we've split that up into message top
114:17 - message bottom
114:18 - now for the this section right here
114:22 - so we're going to actually assume that
114:23 - this whole thing
114:25 - by the way like we have hit over 114
114:29 - dollars in revenue
114:30 - that is insane yeah 23 000 views so
114:34 - thank you guys so much for that that is
114:36 - absolutely epic frank says how's it
114:38 - looking
114:39 - nice sharing appreciate it
114:43 - insane dude insane so much
114:47 - nice so here guys this is we're gonna
114:49 - actually wrap inside of a form
114:51 - so over here we're gonna say form and
114:54 - this form we don't have an action here
114:56 - so it's just a form
114:57 - and here we have two input fields so i'm
114:59 - gonna say input
115:00 - one like so and input two right and the
115:04 - first one is going to be
115:05 - the so it's gonna have a placeholder of
115:07 - just which says what's on your mind
115:09 - right so the first one's gonna say
115:11 - what's on your mind so it's gonna have a
115:12 - placeholder
115:14 - and that's what they say on the actual
115:16 - facebook
115:17 - one so it says what's on your mind boom
115:20 - like so save it and there we go let's go
115:23 - ahead and import the avatar
115:26 - as well so we've got that at the top and
115:28 - then the bottom ones we can go ahead and
115:30 - remove this input type because by
115:31 - default it is typed text
115:33 - so we can go ahead and get rid of that
115:35 - and now here guys we're going to go
115:36 - ahead and give this one a class name as
115:38 - well so the first one we're going to go
115:39 - ahead and say this has a class name of
115:41 - message sender input
115:42 - the second one we're going to give it a
115:44 - placeholder which says
115:47 - image url which is optional so this
115:49 - one's going to be for the image url and
115:51 - the first one is going to be for
115:53 - the actual message that you're sending
115:55 - right so once we have that in place
115:58 - we're then going to have a hidden button
115:59 - right so this is actually i'll explain
116:01 - why we have this afterwards
116:02 - but this hidden button is crucial now
116:05 - we're going to this is going to fire off
116:06 - a handle submit function so i'm going to
116:08 - say const handle submit
116:09 - takes an event and so anytime you have
116:13 - some kind of on click it actually gives
116:14 - you something called an event so here
116:16 - it's going to be e
116:18 - and we don't want it to refresh when we
116:20 - submit so we're going to say e dot
116:21 - prevent default
116:23 - like that and this will actually trigger
116:25 - this function when we click
116:27 - and also guys by making it type submit
116:29 - it means that when we're inside of this
116:31 - function so if i type something and i
116:32 - hit enter it actually submits the form
116:35 - right so it actually submits the form
116:36 - and that triggers this function right
116:38 - here
116:39 - so how so if you literally with the on
116:42 - click event
116:43 - when you submit it's going to show it
116:46 - right there because of the line that you
116:47 - just added right the e dot prevent
116:49 - default
116:49 - so if you couldn't add that line then it
116:51 - would refresh or how would that work
116:53 - so yes if i actually got rid of this
116:55 - sign for a sec so let's go ahead and do
116:56 - this
116:57 - and let's go back to our one so it says
116:59 - message for sender not just go to feed
117:02 - oh oops feed let's go ahead and fix this
117:05 - import message sender we need to import
117:07 - that into our app so let's go save it
117:09 - and if we refresh we should see now that
117:12 - we have a very ugly looking
117:14 - input and it says cannot resolve message
117:16 - sender.css
117:17 - i need to create that file i forgot to
117:19 - do that messages.css
117:21 - boom and now this will actually should
117:24 - pull it in so we should see the file
117:27 - come in there we go so we've got the
117:28 - avatar and what's on your mind so now if
117:30 - i type in here type in here and i hit
117:32 - enter
117:33 - it refreshes you see that so you see at
117:35 - the top isn't here i see the
117:38 - it refreshes now we don't want that and
117:41 - we actually hate refreshing so we by
117:43 - putting e dot prevent default it's
117:44 - preventing the default behavior
117:46 - so now when we do it we should notice
117:50 - that
117:51 - if i type i type and i hit enter i don't
117:53 - even have to go to that button if i just
117:54 - type enter now
117:55 - it's not actually going to do it so it
117:57 - stops that default behavior from
117:59 - happening
117:59 - right beautiful so the next section is
118:03 - the
118:03 - bottom message center bottoms uh part
118:06 - right so here we're gonna have a few
118:08 - things we're gonna have
118:08 - three options right and each of these
118:11 - options are gonna refer to
118:12 - this live video photo video and feeling
118:14 - an activity
118:16 - so we're gonna go ahead and create that
118:17 - we're gonna say dev dot
118:19 - message sender message sender option
118:22 - like this right it's gonna be the first
118:24 - one guys
118:26 - we just crossed one thousand eight
118:27 - hundred likes on this video
118:29 - let's go okay likes that's insane 1
118:33 - 800 likes wow that's 1800 people
118:36 - clicking the button until it turns
118:38 - blue that's insane hopefully we can
118:40 - reach the 2k mark but thank you guys so
118:42 - much
118:43 - yeah that's insane dude like if i think
118:45 - we will break 2k
118:46 - i think you guys can help us do that if
118:48 - you're enjoying the video all we ask is
118:49 - that you smash that thumbs up button
118:52 - and share with others as well so we can
118:54 - all
118:55 - exactly share with others tag us in your
118:57 - instagram stories our links
118:59 - are right here dope
119:02 - nice with that said guys we are gonna
119:04 - inside of the option so
119:06 - the first option is gonna consist of a
119:08 - video camera icon so it's
119:10 - the video camera icon is this one right
119:12 - here material ui and a h3 tag which says
119:15 - live video so let's go ahead and import
119:17 - the video camera icon
119:19 - uh i'm going to actually import all
119:20 - three so we have three icons up here
119:23 - i'm going to go ahead and drop them in
119:24 - here so video cam icon photo library
119:27 - icon and the insert
119:28 - emoticon icon so we have the first one
119:32 - here
119:32 - and this one is actually going to go
119:34 - ahead and pop in
119:35 - the following for us you see we get the
119:37 - icon and we get live video
119:39 - now that's going to give us that the
119:42 - second one is going to be
119:43 - the photo and video and notice guys so
119:46 - i'm actually also passing in an inline
119:48 - style which changes the color of the
119:50 - icon
119:51 - to red and this one the color of the
119:53 - icon to green so i like to mix it up
119:55 - no i don't always like to use direct css
119:57 - i'd like to show you guys
119:58 - a mix of inline styling as well so that
120:00 - way you guys can learn that
120:02 - in case you didn't know how to do that
120:04 - the next one is the photo and
120:06 - video one as well and then we're going
120:08 - to have the last one which is feeling an
120:10 - activity
120:11 - just go ahead and drop that in over here
120:13 - so save
120:15 - and we still have we still
120:18 - also have over half a thousand people
120:21 - watching this video guys
120:22 - so live right now it's just mind
120:24 - mind-blowing like to think
120:26 - that there's that many people right now
120:28 - that's like a little stadium of people
120:29 - like insane
120:30 - literally imagine all of those people in
120:32 - a room that would be insane
120:34 - like it's insane right is it proper
120:36 - crazy to really look into live events
120:37 - that's crazy
120:38 - and yeah these icons like the live icon
120:41 - then the photo icon and the smiley face
120:43 - icon
120:43 - are all those material ui icons or what
120:46 - yeah they are material ui icons
120:48 - because yeah they really look they look
120:50 - very legit does facebook use the exact
120:52 - same ones because
120:53 - yeah so so they don't use the exact but
120:56 - they're very similar
120:57 - and a lot of them are actually a lot of
120:59 - them are actually the exact ones
121:01 - yeah all right so it's really really
121:03 - good um
121:05 - nice so dj frankie
121:09 - from kenya says you guys are amazing
121:12 - picking lots of tricks up from the
121:14 - stream awesome dude
121:15 - very very glad that you're getting value
121:17 - from this keep stay tuned guys because
121:19 - we get
121:20 - very very juicy soon so we're going to
121:21 - have the real-time database
121:22 - implementation we're going to have
121:24 - react context api we are going to have a
121:27 - firebase deployment there's so much
121:28 - stuff coming out certification
121:30 - as well yeah and user authentication so
121:32 - like how we're going to get through this
121:34 - like stay tuned and you'll figure it out
121:36 - right
121:38 - so let's carry on going so we've got
121:40 - message sender so message
121:43 - sender dot css now what i'm going to do
121:45 - here is go to our message center dot css
121:47 - and the first thing i'm going to do is
121:49 - apply the following styles so i'm going
121:50 - to say to the overall
121:51 - container i'm going to do display flex
121:53 - margin top 30.
121:55 - effects direction should be column so
121:57 - all of the children get stacked up
121:59 - i'm going to give it a background color
122:00 - of white border radius of 15 so you get
122:02 - this nice rounded effect
122:04 - box shadow which gives it this floating
122:06 - card effect and a width of 100 so it
122:08 - takes up the full width of the screen
122:10 - uh or full width of its parent container
122:12 - the next thing we're going to do is that
122:14 - top section
122:15 - right so we're going to go ahead and
122:16 - start start that top section we're going
122:17 - to say display flex
122:19 - which pushes the avatar in line with the
122:21 - rest of them
122:22 - we're then going to do border bottom one
122:23 - pixel solid so that gives it this little
122:25 - break
122:26 - uh here padding bottom gives it a little
122:28 - bit of spacing at the bottom and the
122:29 - padding around it 15 pixels
122:32 - awesome so we can actually go ahead and
122:33 - get rid of this one if we do that
122:35 - nice so with that said we can then go
122:38 - ahead and target that form
122:40 - so i want that form to actually go ahead
122:42 - and take up all of the room it possibly
122:44 - can
122:45 - and i want it to then be display flex as
122:47 - well so that will help us with the next
122:49 - part which is actually
122:50 - going inside the form and targeting the
122:53 - input container
122:54 - so we go inside the form and we target
122:56 - the input container
122:57 - and here we say outline width of zero
122:59 - and what this does guys is you see this
123:00 - little blue outline
123:02 - it goes ahead and gets rid of that right
123:05 - so it goes ahead and gets rid of that
123:07 - and then we're going to say border none
123:08 - so it should get rid of that and we're
123:10 - going to say padding
123:11 - 5 pixels margin zero left and right
123:14 - um i think it's zero top and bottom ten
123:16 - left and right
123:17 - border radius rounded so it's like a
123:19 - perfect oval and then a background color
123:21 - so if we go ahead and do that
123:23 - we get boom we get these nice little you
123:25 - see that it's very very clean
123:27 - very very nice um and also i
123:30 - want to add this this is bugging me it
123:31 - says what's on your mind question mark
123:34 - it's a little subtle things guys so
123:38 - that really drives me crazy for us says
123:42 - for us khan got landed randomly on your
123:44 - live it's amazing
123:46 - i always wanted that type of content you
123:48 - guys rock
123:49 - wow man it's it's insane thank you so
123:51 - much for us
123:52 - you know it's this type of content is i
123:54 - love it because i feel like it's very
123:56 - easy to digest even when sunny is going
123:58 - through tutorials that might seem
123:59 - so complicated for many people we try to
124:02 - make it the most
124:02 - easiest for you guys to engage and
124:04 - actually you know finish out the whole
124:06 - build which is
124:07 - really the end point that we want to get
124:09 - you guys to exactly
124:11 - exactly and we're just really glad that
124:12 - you guys are enjoying it because we'll
124:14 - keep it coming
124:15 - we'll definitely keep it coming guys if
124:16 - you're enjoying this
124:18 - nice so we added that net that portion
124:21 - this which is the input right
124:23 - so the next thing that we are going to
124:25 - do is actually go ahead and add in
124:28 - the following we're going to say target
124:31 - the button
124:32 - inside of that form and do display none
124:34 - so you see the hidden submit
124:36 - we don't actually want to show that
124:37 - submit button so it's very simple and
124:39 - there's a reason being because
124:40 - you just wanna it's a very intuitive
124:42 - experience right
124:43 - when you go here and you say what's on
124:45 - your mind and you just type in like hey
124:47 - uh i'm good or something or like hey uh
124:49 - i'm pumped or something like that
124:51 - it pumped and you hit enter you just
124:53 - want it to work
124:54 - we don't want to go to a button click
124:56 - here you just want to have some natural
124:57 - behavior hey what's in your mind
124:59 - um hitting the gym or something like
125:01 - that right here in the gym and you just
125:03 - say enter boom
125:04 - sends it off right we don't actually
125:06 - want that little button so what we do is
125:07 - we hide the button but it keeps the
125:08 - functionality
125:09 - and acts as a submit so when you hit
125:11 - enter key it actually triggers the
125:13 - button
125:14 - and then what we're going to do is
125:15 - change the whole experience of
125:16 - everything
125:17 - because yeah man you don't want to be
125:19 - hitting submit every time it's like you
125:21 - want to do
125:21 - you know everybody cares about their
125:23 - time it's the most valuable assets that
125:25 - we have and
125:26 - if really your design is made in a way
125:29 - so that you can
125:30 - you know share that with others and
125:32 - actually make it so that it's it's
125:34 - important for your design and your users
125:36 - then that's going to take your
125:38 - whole build the next level so that's
125:40 - great
125:41 - nice and dude i love this comment so
125:44 - jurgen hector actually said though i
125:48 - only know javascript fundamentals and i
125:50 - haven't started any type of react.js
125:52 - this tutorial isn't very complicated to
125:54 - understand
125:55 - that's what we're going for like that's
125:57 - exactly what we're going for
125:58 - that exact sort of thing right
126:01 - um what i always say to people so i
126:03 - always get a question of when should i
126:05 - learn
126:05 - react or when should i start my journey
126:06 - with react just start as soon as
126:08 - possible because like
126:09 - like jordan said yeah just start right
126:12 - now and just literally start by
126:14 - following along with the tutorials
126:15 - follow along with the builds and guys
126:17 - before you know it these things come
126:19 - like everything will come to you
126:20 - in the natural place right so very very
126:23 - important stuff
126:24 - we're at 1878 likes let's go
126:28 - what is it 22 more likes to get to 1 900
126:31 - likes guys help us out with a thumbs up
126:33 - if you guys are still here
126:34 - for those of you who are just jumping in
126:36 - right now we're building
126:37 - facebook literally building facebook so
126:40 - you guys can see so like that video
126:42 - let's get to 1 900 guys thank you so
126:44 - much exactly
126:46 - nice awesome dude so let's go ahead and
126:49 - the next thing we're going to do
126:50 - is actually go ahead and target the
126:52 - message sender input
126:54 - now this is the input which says what's
126:56 - on your mind i gave it a class name
126:58 - and i'm going to say flex one which will
126:59 - push everything else it'll try and take
127:02 - up as much room as possible
127:03 - because this is an optional field this
127:05 - is the main field so that's how why
127:07 - i chose to do that in that way now the
127:10 - actual facebook doesn't have this
127:12 - image url optional we added that because
127:13 - it actually simplifies
127:15 - how you can have the image functionality
127:19 - without the sort of file picker yep i
127:21 - like this comment
127:25 - says the submit button is useful for
127:27 - mobile devices you can make it disappear
127:29 - in desktop screens
127:30 - what do you think nice yeah so submit so
127:33 - very s
127:33 - is true yes it's a good point so the
127:36 - submit button is actually useful in
127:38 - mobile devices
127:39 - but um yes that's true actually very
127:43 - true good point
127:44 - so if you are going to be doing it that
127:45 - way what you could do is you could use
127:46 - something called a css media query
127:49 - and that will actually you can then
127:51 - conditionally render
127:52 - this component based on the screen size
127:56 - so it's very simple to do that um and
127:58 - you can actually go ahead and i think
127:59 - it's it's literally written something
128:00 - like this it'll be something like at
128:02 - media and you say when there's a max
128:04 - width or something like this you do win
128:06 - this max width of like a 1200 pixels
128:09 - then you would apply this raw and you
128:11 - would basically say
128:12 - show or like a visible or something
128:15 - right that's how you do that
128:17 - and that would say that that's amazing
128:19 - yeah so that's that's called a media
128:20 - query
128:21 - and that's what you'll be able to do and
128:22 - i actually need to move the comment so
128:24 - there we go
128:25 - and yo what's up logan how's it going
128:27 - man he says hey guys how's it going
128:29 - bill looks sick hey we got logan's
128:33 - profit with javascript he's part of the
128:34 - the clever programmer community as well
128:36 - so what's up man
128:38 - stay tuned guys moving on with the build
128:40 - nice he goes the facebook stories makes
128:42 - this build
128:43 - pop off yeah awesome do you agree yeah
128:46 - that was a fun thing to build nice um
128:50 - somebody said if only we can click the
128:52 - like button many times
128:53 - use your ipad use your phone use
128:56 - different gmail accounts get that like
128:59 - yeah your brother-in-law tell your
129:01 - sister
129:02 - exactly the video nice oh my god we're
129:05 - at 1
129:06 - 900 likes on this video guys
129:10 - man holy crap 2 000 people liking it
129:14 - amazing
129:14 - and we're also good chat donations thank
129:18 - you so much
129:19 - sonny you're killing it man i'm glad hey
129:22 - cheers bro it's been amazing going on
129:24 - our live streams together and guys we'll
129:25 - have many more of these coming up so i
129:27 - love going live with frankie it's always
129:28 - fun
129:30 - nice so let's go so we've got the
129:32 - message
129:33 - sender bottom next so let's go ahead and
129:35 - give that a display flex which means
129:37 - that all of the children including the
129:38 - live video photo video and filling
129:40 - activity
129:41 - should go into a row right so there we
129:45 - go goes into a row and space
129:46 - evenly with justify content and then
129:49 - what we're going to say is for each of
129:50 - the options i'm going to apply the
129:51 - following
129:52 - all right so let's go down here let's go
129:54 - ahead and do the following so we're
129:55 - going to say padding at 20 pixels
129:57 - display flex
129:58 - which means that the icons now aren't
130:00 - sitting on top but they're in a row with
130:02 - them
130:02 - a line item center which means that
130:04 - these are central to
130:05 - the actual um icon itself the color is
130:09 - great and margin of 5 pixels
130:11 - which is awesome and then we're going to
130:12 - talk about you off sonny but
130:14 - i we just got a really really cool
130:16 - comment right here by abishek
130:18 - he says hey sonny thanks for so much
130:20 - hard work you guys are putting i have
130:21 - built more than three clones
130:23 - so far whenever i see video notification
130:26 - from you guys it gives me boosts
130:28 - to do more coding wow three builds man
130:31 - that's insane hopefully they're on your
130:33 - portfolio man hopefully
130:34 - you know you don't just keep them on
130:35 - your computer or anything share them
130:37 - with people
130:38 - actually even teach people and then if
130:40 - you're enjoying this guys
130:41 - share this with others as well we're at
130:43 - 1937 likes
130:44 - let's reach 2k thank you so much guys
130:47 - that's awesome dude and exactly like
130:49 - if we if we can motivate you that's
130:51 - insane like and he's done three of the
130:53 - bills which is insane
130:54 - keep it up abhishek saying and also i
130:56 - think i've seen
130:57 - uh a tag on instagram uh where you
131:00 - tagged
131:01 - us in it so like if that was you then
131:03 - awesome dude keep doing that and it's
131:05 - cool to see your work
131:06 - nice so um
131:10 - oh nice niraj bowada it says interesting
131:13 - live i'm here since the start
131:15 - thanks a lot for the live awesome dude
131:17 - glad you're still watching
131:19 - that's amazing nice let's go
131:23 - so we've got the message sender option
131:26 - at the bottom and then what we're going
131:27 - to do is we're going to target the text
131:29 - and that text is a h3 tag i'm going to
131:30 - say font size is medium
131:32 - i'm also going to push a margin left of
131:34 - 10 pixels which would push it away from
131:36 - the icon
131:37 - the next thing i want to do is also add
131:39 - a hover so right now when we hover over
131:40 - it then nothing actually happens
131:42 - so i'm going to go ahead and do this so
131:44 - we're going to hover over and you'll get
131:45 - a nice little gray
131:46 - hover effect now as a natural ui element
131:50 - what we should be doing here is for that
131:52 - element we should do a cursor pointer
131:55 - so if i save this now now it has that
131:57 - pointer
131:58 - element which is a lot cleaner than if
132:00 - we didn't do it without right so that's
132:02 - a lot better to do it
132:03 - in that way
132:05 - [Music]
132:07 - says having no idea about react.jso
132:09 - still able to follow
132:11 - all that you're doing and it's just
132:12 - amazing that's what we're talking about
132:14 - that's exactly the kind of style we're
132:16 - going for even if you haven't coded
132:18 - before
132:18 - um so core says i joined late is it too
132:21 - late it's never too late
132:23 - to carry on burning you can literally
132:25 - jump in now and you'll be learning
132:26 - something new we still have the react
132:28 - context api
132:29 - the real-time database all of those
132:31 - juicy things coming up so stay tuned yep
132:34 - yep never mind and also really you know
132:36 - most people think that
132:38 - they don't take the psychological or the
132:40 - fun aspect of
132:41 - coding to be an important part of it an
132:43 - important role
132:44 - that's really what makes most people you
132:47 - know stop
132:48 - in their journey as to become
132:49 - programmers and that's really what we
132:51 - want to share with you guys you can have
132:52 - fun
132:53 - you can have fun with your friends
132:54 - engage crack some jokes while you're
132:56 - coding
132:56 - that's actually going to make your
132:57 - journey go the long term so never forget
133:00 - that guys that's why we do it
133:02 - we teach you guys in this way and it's
133:04 - just you know pretty much two
133:05 - two buddies here hanging out and coding
133:07 - and teaching you guys on the
133:09 - on the path so yep exactly that
133:12 - literally
133:12 - it's just two bodies teaching you guys
133:14 - how to code that's how we like to think
133:15 - of it
133:16 - nice dope so let's go ahead and carry on
133:20 - so now we've got
133:21 - message sender let's go ahead and check
133:23 - it out so we've done
133:25 - so pretty much at this point message
133:26 - sender itself is functionally complete
133:28 - but we need to do two things
133:30 - we need to keep track of the input so
133:32 - right now when i type
133:33 - we don't actually track this in the
133:35 - state we don't actually do anything with
133:36 - that in the state so
133:38 - now what i need to do is go ahead and
133:39 - introduce two pieces of state so stay
133:41 - inside of react is essentially how we
133:43 - write a
133:44 - react variable so in this case we're
133:46 - going to have one to
133:47 - keep track of the input the input so
133:50 - here we say the actual variable name is
133:52 - called
133:52 - input and then we have a modifier or a
133:54 - setter function called
133:56 - set whatever the variable is called so
133:58 - in this case is
133:59 - set input and now what we're going to do
134:01 - is we're going to use
134:02 - the use state hook because this is a
134:04 - functional component
134:06 - damn dude we just got a massive donation
134:09 - jessica apollinar thank you so much
134:12 - 100 mexican pesos cn pesos i love it
134:16 - as usual all of you guys never
134:17 - disappoint me i have no words to thank
134:19 - you i work as
134:20 - front end dev and i've been learning a
134:21 - lot of new stuff you're
134:23 - amazing thank you so much jessica we've
134:26 - seen jessica before right
134:27 - she's dropped a lot of donations before
134:29 - she's always coming up and showing up in
134:31 - these uh in these live streams so we
134:33 - massively massively appreciate you
134:34 - jessica
134:35 - and that's awesome she actually works as
134:37 - a front end dev and she's still
134:38 - learning so like guys these cater for
134:40 - anyone who's starting out on coding even
134:42 - if you're an experienced developer
134:43 - we have people like frank logan who's in
134:46 - the in the chat right now
134:47 - who are experienced developers and they
134:49 - are actually still learning and
134:50 - continuing on that journey
134:52 - so even i by doing these builds i'm
134:54 - learning so make sure
134:55 - you guys are always upgrading going that
134:57 - next step and
134:58 - keep staying tuned and have this
135:00 - positive energy like jessica that's
135:01 - awesome thank you so much
135:03 - never stop learning guys thank you so
135:04 - much jessica what part of mexico are you
135:06 - from drop it in the chat we want to know
135:08 - and also we're at 1969 likes 30 likes
135:11 - away 31 likes away from 2 000. oh my god
135:14 - i'm so excited thank you guys so much
135:16 - 119 in chat donations dude wow
135:20 - that's insane love that dude nice
135:24 - and we still have over half a thousand
135:26 - people
135:27 - holy crap this is so dope once you say
135:30 - like that it sounds like
135:31 - whoa yeah it's insane because we just
135:34 - see a number and
135:35 - we kind of get used to the number when
135:36 - you think about it it's like yeah this
135:38 - is crazy
135:39 - right that's true so we've got this
135:41 - input set input and by default it's
135:43 - going to have an empty
135:44 - value as its initial piece of state we
135:46 - need to then import it from a react so
135:48 - what we need to do is go here and say
135:50 - use state
135:50 - and that will import it from react we
135:52 - saved that file
135:54 - and then we go down here and what we
135:55 - need to do is this is a
135:57 - very slick way of implementing this so
136:00 - here is where we have the input field
136:02 - that we want to map to our state right
136:04 - so we're going to go ahead and do a
136:05 - value of the input field it's mapped to
136:08 - our input and the input is the actual
136:12 - um the the key the variable that i've
136:14 - named it here now notice when i type
136:16 - so actually we need to go to the actual
136:18 - app sorry notice when i type
136:20 - so let's go ahead and do this notice
136:21 - when i type it doesn't let me type in so
136:23 - i'm actually banging away at the
136:24 - keyboard right now
136:25 - i need to actually add something called
136:27 - an on change and on change will fire off
136:29 - an event every time
136:30 - i uh i start to type and what we're
136:32 - going to do is we're going to set the
136:33 - input
136:34 - to e.target.value which is essentially
136:36 - what i just typed
136:38 - right so it's a very like sort of weird
136:39 - thing but that's exactly exactly what
136:41 - you're just typing in
136:42 - uh forehand kureshi says top quality
136:44 - content amazing delivery content
136:46 - quality sorry react is super cool
136:48 - especially when it's taught this way
136:50 - hats off to you guys i appreciate that
136:51 - dude massively appreciate that
136:54 - thank you papa react hey
136:57 - that's it papa frank
137:05 - nice so we've done that for the input
137:07 - fold and now when i type it works you
137:09 - see that so everything's good on that
137:10 - front
137:11 - we're going to do the same thing for the
137:12 - second one and we're going to give this
137:14 - one just a simple
137:16 - we're going to say image url right set
137:19 - image url
137:20 - there we go and for this one we're going
137:22 - to do the same thing we're going to say
137:23 - value equals image url so
137:25 - value equals image url and then we're
137:27 - going to say on change
137:29 - when we start typing in it fires off an
137:31 - event because it's an arrow function
137:32 - we're going to say
137:33 - set the image url to become
137:37 - e.target.value which is essentially what
137:39 - we just typed in
137:40 - now to test that everything is working
137:42 - and that we haven't broken everything
137:44 - we can go here to the image url and we
137:46 - can start typing in and it works so
137:48 - everything is hooked up correctly
137:50 - justin phillips says you guys make
137:52 - programming so damn easy and fun
137:54 - love that dude that's what we're going
137:56 - for oh man
137:57 - you guys keep us pumped man thank you so
138:00 - much appreciate exactly

138:45 - is the we actually just went ahead and
138:47 - finished the message sender
138:49 - right so we did that and what we're
138:51 - going to do is also when we type in
138:53 - what we're going to do is naturally that
138:54 - behavior of when we sort of enter
138:56 - something is
138:57 - in what what we would do when we enter
138:59 - is we'll do some some clever
139:01 - database stuff right here so we'll say
139:03 - some clever db stuff
139:04 - over here but then what we would do is
139:06 - we would want to reset the
139:08 - um reset the
139:11 - values inside of this so now what we
139:12 - should see is when we type in
139:14 - so let's go ahead and type in so we can
139:17 - see
139:18 - type in here and we can go here and type
139:20 - in here and if i hit enter
139:21 - boom it resets the fields which is
139:23 - really clean very very nice right
139:26 - so now what we're going to do is sub
139:28 - courses should i show these projects on
139:30 - my resume yes
139:31 - 100 show them on your resume
139:34 - uh it will help you get a job and a lot
139:35 - of people are actually getting jobs with
139:37 - these resumes and we've seen it
139:38 - so make sure you go ahead and do that so
139:41 - now what we're going to do is we're
139:42 - going to go
139:43 - back to our feed component so feed.js
139:46 - and here what we're going to do is we
139:49 - are going to this checkout feed
139:52 - here we actually have the post next
139:54 - right so the post is the interesting
139:56 - component that we are
139:57 - which we know facebook for is how you
139:59 - can post content onto your feed
140:02 - and what we're going to do is just keep
140:04 - it simple right now we're going to go
140:05 - ahead and do this we're going to say
140:06 - feed

140:10 - and the feed oh sorry no feed sorry post
140:13 - post there we go and let's go ahead and
140:15 - create that component so
140:16 - post dot js as such we do rfce
140:22 - boom we see that we do class names let's
140:24 - go ahead and do class name
140:25 - equals post and we need to go ahead and
140:27 - import the css files
140:29 - import post.css go ahead and create that
140:33 - file so post.css
140:36 - and now what we're going to do is and
140:39 - somebody actually just said it's
140:41 - it's really it's really cute that you
140:43 - guys enjoy and appreciate every little

141:05 - position and it's something we'll never
141:07 - let on to
141:08 - let hold of yeah it's true man like
141:11 - that's
141:11 - what i talk with cause a lot of times
141:13 - you have to be humble in your life
141:14 - because
141:15 - once you have that level of humility to
141:17 - yourself that you can enjoy every small
141:18 - win
141:19 - then you're gonna be able to recognize
141:21 - bigger opportunities because once that
141:23 - you're in that
141:24 - that mind zone of thinking like oh i'm
141:26 - too good like sonny can think he's too
141:27 - good
141:27 - but no he's a very humble guy and he's
141:30 - always sharing everything with you guys
141:31 - he doesn't think he's like the best or
141:32 - anything
141:33 - that's what's going to get you to the
141:34 - next next levels
141:36 - and we just got another donation by
141:38 - faraz khan thank you so much man
141:41 - and he says recently working with react
141:44 - and
141:44 - d3js have basic knowledge knowledge of
141:47 - react
141:47 - following your session will make me pro
141:49 - soon hell yeah
141:52 - awesome lots of stuffs you guys are
141:54 - amazing thank you nice
141:55 - man d3.js is a really nice way of
141:58 - handling
141:59 - data is in that i think it's number
142:00 - crunching pretty much so it's whenever
142:02 - you're handing numbers or sort of graphs
142:04 - you can use d3.js i think that's what
142:06 - you're using it for
142:07 - uh but that's awesome yeah really really
142:09 - nice uh somebody says
142:11 - man maybe mark zuckerberg is watching
142:12 - this live dude can you actually
142:14 - imagine mark zuckerberg saw this live
142:16 - like
142:17 - it would be so funny huh i mean i could
142:19 - man who knows like
142:20 - yeah that was in facebook and somebody
142:22 - was building out to be like damn these
142:23 - guys are
142:24 - pretty lit you know yeah imagine him
142:27 - dropping a donation that'd be insane
142:29 - exactly like hey this is mark here this
142:31 - is a hundred million dollars you know
142:33 - just a small token of appreciation
142:37 - nice it's what was in my pocket exactly
142:40 - yeah nice so we'll go ahead and we
142:43 - import that component which is the post
142:45 - right so we're gonna just uh
142:46 - sort of exaggerate and drop like three
142:48 - posts and each post is going to have
142:50 - a few things it's going to have let's go
142:53 - ahead and open up our post
142:55 - it's going to have uh let's go ahead
142:57 - this is where we get the props
142:59 - so we're going to destructure the props
143:00 - and we're going to get a few things we
143:01 - get the profile picture the image the
143:03 - username
143:04 - the timestamp and a message from our
143:07 - from what we expect so i'm gonna go here
143:09 - and do this
143:10 - and then what we're gonna do is we are
143:13 - gonna go
143:14 - inside of here and the post consists of
143:16 - a few things right so
143:18 - let's go ahead ahead and look at this
143:20 - main app so right now we actually
143:21 - haven't got the post here but we're
143:22 - going to go ahead and create it for you
143:23 - guys
143:24 - so the post has a few sections so the
143:26 - first one is the top so we're going to
143:27 - say post
143:28 - top just like we did before and inside
143:30 - of the post op we have
143:32 - uh we have an avatar and we have some
143:36 - text right so i'm going to go ahead and
143:37 - drop that in so we just got two dollars
143:40 - which says
143:40 - global persistent to keep log in on
143:42 - refresh please
143:44 - um so today thank you so much firstly
143:46 - for the donation
143:48 - so persistent login is by default when
143:51 - you do
143:51 - a username and password logins with
143:53 - firebase authentication
143:55 - but when you're using google
143:56 - authentication it doesn't persist you're
143:58 - right
143:59 - so we are we haven't actually covered
144:01 - that in this in today's world
144:02 - um but we will show that in a different
144:04 - build um it's a little bit of work to do
144:06 - that and i think we have a lot of stuff
144:08 - we still need to build
144:10 - so we're going to try and get that
144:11 - squeezed in instead of getting the uh
144:13 - persistence
144:14 - yeah thank you thank you so much
144:15 - appreciate it man thanks dude
144:18 - so now what we're going to do is here is
144:20 - the avatar that we're going to be
144:21 - popping in
144:22 - the avatar by default we'll take the
144:24 - profile picture
144:25 - prop then we have the um times so we're
144:29 - going to go ahead
144:30 - and remove this for now sorry so we're
144:33 - going to have a p
144:34 - tag so let's go ahead and drop this out
144:36 - the p tag here will say the time so it
144:37 - will say something like
144:39 - uh i'm just going to say a timestamp
144:40 - goes here right and then here we have
144:43 - the username prop so it's a h3 tag
144:45 - and so forth so the avatar is not
144:47 - defined so we need to go ahead and
144:48 - import that so i'm going to go ahead and
144:50 - do our little smart import trick
144:52 - that pulls it in at the top nice
144:55 - so once we have that we can see that
144:58 - we've got three posts we've got
145:00 - timestamp timestamp and an avatar so it
145:02 - doesn't look too great at the moment but
145:03 - we're getting there
145:04 - uh we're gonna have a bottom section so
145:06 - let's go ahead and add a
145:08 - another div which says post bottom
145:11 - uh such there we go and then this one is
145:14 - going to have
145:15 - the message itself which sits inside so
145:18 - this one will have a p tag which has the
145:21 - message itself so this would be the post
145:22 - message
145:23 - inside of that underneath the post if
145:26 - we're actually going to have another div
145:28 - which says post underscore image and
145:30 - this will be the actual image that shows
145:32 - up right
145:33 - so this would be the actual image like
145:35 - that
145:37 - um and then this will have uh and this
145:40 - will have actually
145:41 - a image tag which will take the image
145:43 - which comes this through as a prop
145:45 - up here so that that's where it comes in
145:47 - like that
145:48 - uh we just got another one oh damn from
145:51 - priyank again
145:52 - again thank you so much man yes dude
145:55 - you guys are so humble and amazing thank
145:57 - you thank you man so
145:59 - so much so much we really do appreciate
146:01 - every little thing
146:02 - yeah whoa whoa
146:06 - thanks to william cruz we know what chf
146:08 - means and that means
146:09 - i think it's uh swiss wiz franks right
146:12 - yeah yeah
146:13 - five five swiss francs that's awesome so
146:16 - much appreciation thank you
146:17 - sonny you think you can um can we see
146:20 - like what
146:21 - the code is connected to on the real
146:23 - build so right now you're doing the
146:25 - message and then you're doing the image
146:26 - right
146:27 - yeah that's what we're writing right now
146:29 - so where would that be
146:30 - uh so this right now is actually so the
146:33 - reason being is i think the database
146:34 - went
146:34 - uh i think it didn't go down but i think
146:37 - seriously yeah it might have got pulled
146:39 - yeah so let's go ahead and quickly try
146:41 - and log in if we can't then
146:43 - and somebody says the image is
146:44 - flickering right so yeah this is i don't
146:46 - know why that's happening guys but it's
146:47 - a very
146:48 - small problem uh that we can't really
146:50 - get around while we're live
146:51 - so i'm sorry about that but yeah it
146:54 - should be fine for sure but yeah what
146:56 - i'm going to do frankie is i'm actually
146:57 - going to pass in some dummy there so we
146:58 - can actually see
146:59 - the component as we do it nice sounds
147:02 - amazing yeah i think that'll be that'll
147:04 - clear out a lot of people's doubts views
147:06 - and also
147:07 - know exactly where we're at right now
147:09 - awesome so let's go ahead and actually
147:11 - do that right now so inside the feed
147:13 - where we have the post what we're going
147:15 - to do is i'm actually going to go ahead
147:17 - and pop that in right now so we have a
147:19 - feed
147:20 - and this will actually take in a bunch
147:22 - of props
147:23 - so let's go ahead and do the following
147:25 - so for a post you can have a bunch of
147:27 - different props so in this case we're
147:28 - going to have let's replace this
147:30 - so the id we can ignore that for now the
147:32 - profile picture let's go ahead and grab
147:34 - a profile picture so i've got one over
147:36 - here
147:37 - so copy image let's do this
147:42 - save the message will say
147:45 - wow this works i'm like wow this works
147:49 - the timestamp let's just go ahead and
147:51 - say like um
147:53 - this is a timestamp just for very like
147:56 - like very obvious reasons and then
147:58 - they're here we'll just say
148:00 - the username the student the instagram
148:01 - handle says do ssango or something
148:04 - the image uh here for the image we're
148:07 - actually gonna go ahead and grab an
148:08 - image just go to google images
148:09 - i'm gonna quickly pop it off camera for
148:11 - a sec so let's go ahead and google image
148:13 - because we never know what pops up on
148:14 - google images
148:16 - um let's just type in code
148:21 - i'm gonna grab a picture real quick for
148:24 - you guys
148:25 - so let's go ahead and use this one
148:28 - awesome boom boom boom
148:31 - and then here i'm going to go ahead and
148:33 - pop that back in
148:35 - right here so there we go now in this
148:37 - video it was fast
148:39 - yeah so that's it so we have like a we
148:40 - have a post here
148:42 - and i'm going to go ahead and post
148:43 - another one um so we have two posts and
148:45 - this one the second one is not going to
148:47 - have an image the first one is going to
148:48 - have an image so we can see two examples
148:50 - of how that will work
148:52 - yeah and then well that's a good idea
148:54 - frankie actually that you said that
148:56 - because then we they'll be able to get a
148:57 - very
148:57 - visual representation of what's going on
149:00 - nice that's awesome i see that mohamed
149:02 - asks what roadmap should be in one's
149:04 - mind and what list of things should one
149:06 - plan out
149:06 - like documentation class diagram and dfd
149:09 - are these necessary before actually
149:11 - writing codes for project
149:14 - um i can't actually see that uh so
149:17 - just say that again yep he says what
149:20 - roadmap should be in one's mind
149:22 - and what list of things should one plan
149:24 - out like documentation
149:26 - class diagram and dfd are these
149:29 - necessary before
149:30 - coding so honestly guys this is what you
149:33 - learn at like university where they're
149:34 - like oh you're gonna need
149:36 - class diagrams dfdes and this and that
149:38 - like truthfully
149:39 - screw all of that stuff
149:42 - like screw all of that yeah take it from
149:45 - a developer who's been coding a long
149:46 - time like
149:47 - honestly like it's only when you get
149:49 - into very like
149:51 - technical discussions and things like
149:52 - that if you've got a bunch of you
149:54 - developers sitting around
149:55 - and you need to break down a really
149:56 - complicated problem then
149:58 - maybe you might introduce diagram but
150:00 - even then it's kind of like a custom
150:02 - diagram it's not like a class diagram or
150:03 - dfds
150:04 - honestly i would say just start coding
150:06 - these projects right it's like start
150:08 - coding these projects start doing
150:09 - actual practical hands-on coding
150:12 - but truth be told guys yeah don't worry
150:14 - about all that stuff i remember because
150:16 - i used to do this stuff uh i used to
150:17 - like draw diagrams and all that
150:19 - and you just waste time if i'm honest
150:21 - like so don't bother wasting your time
150:23 - we got another oh we got another
150:25 - donation dude
150:26 - wow hdk with 100 indian rupees thank you
150:29 - so much man he says awesome content
150:31 - kudos to the team
150:32 - hey that's cp team the cp family thank
150:35 - you guys so much
150:36 - no i appreciate you all awesome dude
150:38 - thank you so much
150:39 - the greatest ever says screw all of that
150:44 - with british accent you know hey and
150:47 - guys and this is living proof so frank's
150:48 - a developer
150:49 - inside of pwj right now and he's had he
150:51 - has over 10 years of experience he just
150:53 - signed a six-figure client
150:55 - right so sonos the company that do the
150:57 - amazing speakers
150:58 - frank is working with them right now and
151:00 - it says just he says just push to
151:02 - production no diagrams
151:04 - exactly guys just do it like when you
151:06 - make the mistake you'll learn
151:08 - but doing all these diagrams and stuff
151:10 - like that you're just wasting time so
151:11 - just
151:12 - start and do the thing as it happens
151:14 - right
151:15 - yeah like she already both says just do
151:17 - it just exactly
151:18 - you know he he actually had a point he
151:21 - actually was talking about code you guys
151:22 - didn't know
151:23 - yeah exactly now you know yeah
151:27 - so let's go ahead and actually style
151:29 - this right now so this stuff
151:31 - right here let's go ahead and make this
151:32 - look a little nicer so
151:34 - what we're going to go ahead and do now
151:35 - is i'll make this a bit smaller so you
151:36 - guys can see that
151:37 - um what we're going to do now is we're
151:39 - going to go to post.css
151:41 - and inside of post.css let's go ahead
151:43 - and drop it here suppose to css
151:45 - the first thing i'm going to do is
151:49 - do the following so i'm going to say a
151:51 - width of 100
151:52 - a margin top of 15 pixels border radius
151:55 - 15 pixels
151:56 - background color white and a box shadow
151:58 - so you can see now there's a very subtle
152:00 - box shadow but
152:01 - you can see this image is messing
152:03 - everything up right
152:05 - so this image is messing everything up
152:06 - this is inside of a container called
152:08 - post image
152:09 - so we're going to directly attack the
152:10 - child and say it only should be a width
152:12 - of 100 of what the parent container is
152:15 - and immediately that pulls everything in
152:18 - all right so immediately that's going to
152:20 - pour everything in and it still saves
152:22 - the day a bit right
152:23 - so the next thing we're going to do is
152:25 - we're going to target the post top
152:26 - so let's go over to the post top and
152:28 - we're going to say display flex
152:30 - position relative so that way all the
152:31 - children inside of this container
152:33 - if we do absolute positioning they'll be
152:35 - relative to this parent container and
152:37 - then we're going to say align item
152:38 - center to keep everything on the
152:39 - vertical axis
152:43 - we're going to say padding of 15 pixels
152:45 - we also have a very good comment here by
152:46 - one of our own students david jonathan
152:48 - he said it's quite unfortunate some
152:50 - clients waste development time on it yes
152:52 - it's true they do waste a lot of time
152:54 - doing this stuff like the diagrams and
152:56 - stuff like that
152:57 - um but it's actually um it's a it's a
153:00 - it's a good point and david jones is
153:02 - actually doing very well right now and
153:03 - he's inside of
153:04 - bw speaking with him on one of the
153:06 - coaching calls
153:07 - so that is awesome to hear from you dude
153:09 - uh nice so the next thing we're going to
153:11 - do is for the avatar so the actual image
153:13 - i'm going to give it a margin right so
153:15 - that way it doesn't touch the text
153:17 - so we pop that in and it pushes the text
153:19 - away a little bit
153:20 - next thing we're going to do is add a h3
153:23 - so i'm going to go ahead and do this so
153:24 - h3 font size medium
153:26 - and that will drop the text to make it a
153:28 - little bit smaller
153:30 - we're going to target that timestamp
153:32 - underneath which is a p
153:33 - tag a p tag sorry inside and that's
153:35 - going to be small and it's going to be
153:37 - great so that's became
153:38 - gray underneath there um
153:41 - awesome samet angelica says i recently

154:33 - right place my friend
154:35 - uh and also is esau mirai maurice
154:38 - says what do you think about style
154:39 - components and how to know when to use
154:41 - them
154:41 - a quick thought on this because i do
154:43 - like start components
154:44 - they're very powerful because they allow
154:46 - you to combine props with css in an easy
154:48 - manner
154:48 - that's all i'm going to say at this
154:50 - point but definitely go ahead and play
154:51 - with them if you have heard of them
154:52 - before
154:53 - and we'll start using them yeah we're at
154:56 - 2 2093
154:58 - likes let's freaking go almost 2
155:01 - 100. wow that's insane guys and 131
155:05 - dollars in chat donations that's going
155:07 - to be more thankful that's amazing
155:09 - thank you guys love that nice and the
155:12 - build is looking really clean with the
155:13 - with the new image precise man i love it
155:16 - yeah it makes it very very simple to
155:17 - follow makes it very very nice
155:20 - for the bottom half of the image now
155:22 - where the text is we're going to add a
155:23 - little bit of padding we're going to say
155:24 - margin top of
155:26 - 10 pixels margin bottom 10 pixels and
155:28 - padding 15 pixels 25 so top and bottom
155:31 - and left and right
155:32 - and we go ahead and do that and it pops
155:33 - in like this so you're starting to look
155:35 - very clean
155:36 - as we do this now the next thing we want
155:38 - to do is add those buttons that you see
155:40 - underneath so before we actually had
155:42 - some buttons under here
155:43 - which were like the like button the
155:45 - share button those sort of things right
155:47 - so how do we go ahead and do that so i'm
155:49 - going to create a
155:50 - div underneath here and i'm going to say
155:52 - div dot post
155:54 - options like this and each option is
155:58 - going to have its own div so we're going
155:59 - to say div
156:00 - post option so singular is going to be
156:02 - each of the individual ones right
156:05 - so the first one we're going to have is
156:07 - a thumbs up icon with a p
156:08 - tag which says like just go ahead and
156:11 - save that and this
156:12 - thumbs up icon let's go ahead and import
156:14 - that i'm going to import a bunch of
156:15 - things at the top
156:16 - so i'm going to go ahead and do this go
156:18 - ahead and do boom
156:20 - as such and also the account circle icon
156:25 - let's go ahead and do this
156:28 - so i've just imported a few different
156:30 - imports at the top there we go
156:32 - and this one actually you can see we get
156:33 - the like button right so you get a like
156:35 - button at the bottom
156:36 - so i'm going to do the same thing for
156:38 - the comment
156:40 - share and for the account button so i'm
156:42 - going to go ahead
156:43 - and just drop those in underneath here
156:45 - so these are the same things
156:47 - but for different icons and different
156:50 - pieces of text and the last one has a
156:52 - downward carrot
156:53 - icon so there you go and what we're
156:56 - going to do now is we're going to style
156:57 - it so each one had a post option and the
157:00 - outer one was post options so for the
157:03 - outer post
157:04 - options what i'm going to do is i'm
157:05 - going to say post options
157:07 - padding top of 10 pixels border top of
157:10 - a one pixel light gray which give it
157:12 - that light grey at the top
157:14 - and then display flex which meant that
157:15 - it went into a row justify the content
157:17 - to space them evenly so as it resizes
157:19 - it'll be even
157:20 - font size medium color gray cursor
157:22 - pointer so we get this nice hover effect
157:24 - and then the padding of 15 pixels so
157:26 - that's very clean
157:27 - and then for each of the attention sorry
157:29 - about that pay attention to the small
157:31 - details
157:32 - like that like the border top the light
157:34 - gray color of it
157:35 - sometimes like we don't pick up these
157:37 - little details but it what it's what
157:38 - makes an image stand out
157:40 - on your app so you know don't forget
157:42 - those little details it's going to take
157:44 - it to the next level for you exactly
157:46 - they're going to be really really
157:47 - important points guys i realized that i
157:49 - might have put the camera over a little
157:51 - bit on the side so i've just moved that
157:53 - now um yeah these little things are very
157:55 - very important guys
157:57 - so make sure you don't miss those um
158:00 - nice
158:00 - so now what we're going to do is for we
158:02 - want it so that it has a
158:03 - hover effect so when we hover over the
158:05 - option
158:06 - itself uh it's not so sorry for the
158:08 - first thing we're going to do is
158:09 - actually target each of those options
158:11 - and we want to center those things right
158:12 - because right now the icons are slightly
158:15 - off so we're going to do
158:16 - display flex align item center justify
158:18 - center
158:19 - padding 5 pixels and flex 1 so that they
158:22 - try and use up the entire container
158:24 - there we go and then we're going to
158:27 - target that text and we're going to push
158:28 - it slightly away from the icon
158:30 - so that's the p tag we give it a margin
158:33 - left
158:33 - that pushes the text slightly away and
158:36 - then we want a nice hover effect so
158:38 - let's go ahead and add the hover effect
158:40 - right like this so it gives it a hover
158:42 - effect and now if i hover over it you
158:44 - get this nice little
158:45 - hover oh it looks so clean now it looks
158:48 - like
158:48 - individual blocks of post super clean
158:51 - right
158:52 - yeah really really nice and now if we go
158:55 - back to our app.css and we can get rid
158:57 - of that height 100 view height which was
158:59 - stopping it from showing before because
159:00 - now we have an app which is long enough
159:02 - to show the rest of that
159:03 - bro look at this praharsh says wonderful
159:06 - stuff guys this is my fifth

159:31 - just different parts of the world it
159:33 - like it's just
159:34 - seeing what we're doing and the fact is
159:35 - that me and frankie have never actually
159:36 - met in person which is insane and we're
159:38 - doing this stuff like
159:40 - so yeah we've got some insane missions
159:43 - yeah we will we'll meet soon dude
159:44 - definitely nice yeah for me

159:49 - then sunny
159:50 - is in what time is it for you 9 30 p.m
159:54 - bst right pretty yeah nice man
159:57 - so it's late at night for you and yeah
159:59 - we're here we're all getting connected
160:01 - together at the same time
160:02 - learning react let's go exactly let's go
160:05 - guys
160:06 - nice so um
160:09 - the next portion that we're going to
160:11 - actually do
160:12 - is the widget right now the widget is
160:14 - actually it's pretty interesting because
160:16 - the widget is actually easier than we
160:17 - think to build this part
160:18 - so let's go to app.js and here we had
160:21 - the widget portion which was the
160:23 - right side of the app so when we talk
160:25 - about the widget we're actually
160:26 - referring to
160:27 - this part right here so this actually
160:29 - it's very very nice sort of widget that
160:31 - we can scroll down and see
160:32 - right that one right there so in order
160:35 - to do that
160:36 - what we're going to do now is actually
160:37 - go ahead and do the following so
160:40 - and what i'm going to do is i'm actually
160:42 - going to swap the position that they're
160:43 - in
160:46 - reason being is that so that way
160:50 - everyone can actually go ahead and see
160:51 - the widget that we're building
160:53 - on this side right so here we have the
160:56 - widgets
160:57 - right so i'm going to go ahead and
160:58 - create the widgets component so the
161:00 - widgets
161:01 - component and we're going to basically
161:03 - go ahead and do widgets.js
161:07 - oops that should be widgets
161:11 - rename widgets there we go rfce
161:17 - wait for it boom there we go and then we
161:19 - do
161:20 - move our screen to the left side bottom
161:22 - left side
161:23 - uh yeah i've actually moved us into the
161:25 - center
161:27 - okay you think that looks better oh we
161:28 - can oh yeah we can actually yeah we can
161:30 - move it there that's good
161:31 - i think it might yeah i think it might
161:33 - look a little bit cleaner because of a
161:34 - lot of things going on in the center
161:36 - yeah there we go nice that's better
161:40 - so so now we have div class name equals
161:44 - um widgets there we go widgets
161:47 - and then i'm going to create a import so
161:49 - i'm going to say import
161:54 - widgets.css like so
161:56 - there we go and then for the widgets
161:58 - guys so this is actually
162:00 - um an iframe so the way we got this
162:04 - is i think you can actually go ahead and
162:06 - uh it's an iframe that we got from
162:08 - facebook themselves and it links to the
162:10 - clever programmer page
162:12 - and this is something which is available
162:13 - on facebook
162:15 - i won't show you guys it but all you
162:16 - have to do is pretty much type in
162:17 - facebook embed
162:18 - and you'll be able to see that and
162:21 - suddenly what is the knife frame because
162:22 - i didn't know that before going into
162:23 - this call
162:25 - so an iframe is simply basically imagine
162:27 - like you had another tab
162:28 - open right and you had a website on that
162:31 - tab
162:32 - but imagine you're basically just
162:33 - rendering that just in a portion of your
162:36 - web page
162:36 - so it's like in some sense like an
162:38 - embedding another web page into your
162:40 - page right
162:44 - so that's the way that's essentially
162:45 - what we're doing so in this case where
162:47 - we have it
162:48 - like this is our feed we're going to
162:50 - render it here
162:51 - right on the right so what i'm going to
162:53 - do is now is i'm going to pop in the
162:54 - iframe
162:55 - so this is actually got a width of 340 a
162:58 - height of 100
163:00 - and then here inside the actual uh
163:02 - parameters we're changing the width of
163:04 - 340 and the height
163:06 - of 1500 right so it actually gets a high
163:09 - sort of some height to it i'm also going
163:11 - to change the style here so it's going
163:12 - to be border none overflow hidden
163:15 - um and then this stuff you can keep uh
163:17 - as it is right
163:18 - but you guys can pretty much go ahead
163:20 - and copy that and it will work for you
163:21 - guys
163:22 - um and then what we're going to do is
163:24 - easy wow that's crazy
163:26 - yeah that's literally it and then we go
163:28 - here we all we need to do is go ahead
163:30 - and import our widgets so be careful
163:32 - because it actually does import the
163:34 - wrong widget when you do it that way
163:36 - so we want to make sure we import our
163:38 - local widget not material ui widget
163:41 - do that and if we refresh we should see
163:45 - now it says widgets.css does not exist
163:48 - so we need to create widgets dot cs i
163:50 - don't even think we do
163:51 - we use widgets.css but let's stick to
163:54 - the convention
163:55 - and now boom
163:59 - dude there we go whoa there we go let's
164:02 - go
164:02 - connected to the real clever programmer
164:04 - facebook page if you go to the check the
164:06 - facebook page you go check it out
164:07 - you're gonna you're gonna see that it's
164:09 - exactly these posts and you can see us
164:11 - live right there at that moment so
164:13 - that's exactly that's awesome dude
164:16 - nice check that out guys so that's the
164:18 - actual website right now
164:20 - um it looks super clean and you can see
164:22 - like look it's very responsive and you
164:24 - can actually scroll down this thing
164:26 - and you can actually see everything like
164:28 - this that's going on right now in
164:29 - facebook
164:30 - so this is a very nice enhancement that
164:32 - we added as a little sort of last minute
164:33 - i do it's very nice to have even
164:35 - in twitter clone we actually added a
164:36 - sort of a widget to the right side i
164:38 - thought it's a very nice addition
164:40 - so in this case that's a nice little
164:41 - add-on to this great skill to
164:43 - to have honestly i feel like it's going
164:45 - to look so good if you guys apply that
164:47 - in different projects
164:48 - it it really adds so much more spice to
164:51 - that project
164:52 - and something here from who said this
164:57 - oh yeah so the leroy fernandez
165:00 - says what are the upcoming mern stacks
165:02 - builds about
165:04 - so son you want to take that yeah so we
165:06 - have three big builds coming guys
165:08 - we have the tinder the tick tock so in
165:11 - in the correct order we have the tiktok
165:13 - clone we have the tinder clone
165:15 - and then we have the whatsapp clone all
165:19 - when that are going to be built using
165:21 - the man stack and that is on wednesday
165:23 - thursday and friday respectively
165:27 - mind blown this is gonna be a stay tuned
165:29 - guys that's gonna be insane man

165:33 - sunny are gonna kill it for you guys and
165:34 - make sure to
165:35 - if you already did one of those you know
165:38 - builds make sure to add those extra
165:40 - functionalities or learn how to build it
165:41 - in the mern stack
165:43 - yep exactly guys make sure you do that
165:45 - and also guys please don't spam the chat
165:47 - because
165:48 - you're not going to get hurt if you do
165:49 - that i'm just going to block you
165:51 - so yep so don't do that yeah let's keep
165:54 - it
165:54 - to learn here we're at 2141 likes by the
165:58 - way that is
165:59 - nice let's go crush 2 200 likes guys
166:03 - thank you so much and 131 dollars in
166:05 - chat revenue man
166:06 - holy crap insane insane logan says i
166:11 - really need those man stack builds
166:13 - definitely we will bring that in yeah
166:16 - 100
166:18 - so so with that said let's carry on
166:19 - strong guys so here we have the app
166:22 - and what we're going to do now is we are
166:24 - going to go ahead
166:25 - and actually build in the database
166:28 - functionality portion of the app so
166:30 - let's go ahead and actually build out
166:32 - the database part of the app right so
166:35 - what we're going to do now is i think
166:37 - the first step what we should do
166:39 - actually maybe
166:40 - is actually do the login let's do the
166:43 - login part first and then we'll do
166:45 - the the real-time database right so the
166:47 - login what we're going to do now is
166:48 - we're going to assume so
166:50 - to actually have the login we need to
166:53 - have some kind of user in this state
166:55 - right
166:55 - so we're going to say if there was some
166:57 - kind of user so imagine let's just do a
166:58 - very simple
166:59 - example so imagine there's a user right
167:01 - if the user was no
167:04 - then here what i would say is i would
167:07 - say
167:07 - right if there is no user then
167:10 - render the login page so render a login
167:14 - page so in this case let's just do a
167:15 - very simple
167:16 - h1 which says i am a login right
167:18 - otherwise render out
167:20 - the rest of the app otherwise render out
167:22 - the rest of the app so otherwise render
167:24 - out
167:24 - all of this stuff
167:27 - so that's how i would sort of at a very
167:29 - simple level approach this
167:31 - so this is freaking out because yeah
167:33 - whenever you have sibling
167:35 - uh components like this you have to wrap
167:36 - it in either a div
167:38 - or a fragment so this is a jsx fragment
167:41 - and that will fix that error so now what
167:44 - this will say is
167:46 - there is no user user is no right so
167:49 - if we refresh the web page it should
167:51 - actually say a login
167:52 - right and then once we like we went
167:55 - through our login
167:56 - that's just like our sort of login
167:58 - process then what would happen
168:00 - is it would render the rest of the app
168:03 - so in this case
168:04 - um i think it's maybe freaking out
168:06 - because i've used a normal variable
168:08 - okay yeah so you see we don't have a
168:10 - user but let's say i logged in and the
168:12 - user was just to say very simple level
168:14 - sunny
168:14 - right so now when we was
168:18 - if we had to refresh the webpage it
168:20 - would actually show the app so you're
168:22 - essentially logged in right
168:23 - so at a very simple level that's what
168:25 - we're about to do
168:26 - right so uh somebody says that you're
168:29 - about to do redux anytime in the future
168:31 - we're going to be using the react
168:32 - context
168:33 - api today so make sure you
168:36 - uh stay tuned for that pavan kumar whoa

171:11 - js at some point on xjs yeah so 100 did
171:14 - yes the next gs i've used a previous job
171:17 - it is definitely um something which
171:20 - which
171:20 - uh is definitely tricky when you're
171:22 - picking it up for the first time so i
171:24 - would be more than glad to sort of go
171:25 - through this
171:26 - also to improve my knowledge on it so
171:28 - that'll be that'll be fun
171:29 - um so yeah dude it felt so 100 thank you
171:31 - so much for that donation
171:33 - and sg707 texas i'm sure uh wait
171:36 - no it wasn't that one they'll say tara
171:38 - slim says brother your haircut is
171:39 - fresher than this code
171:40 - [Laughter]
171:44 - yes
171:49 - nice thank you ifosa awesome dude
171:52 - so let's go ahead and create the
171:53 - login.js component
171:56 - and what we do is rfce and there's a bit
171:59 - of setup that we need to do at this
172:00 - point so i'm going to go ahead and
172:02 - create the
172:03 - class name class name of login so there
172:06 - we go
172:07 - and here i'm going to do import and i'm
172:09 - going to do login.css
172:11 - boom save that there we go and now
172:14 - what i'm going to do is uh did i create
172:16 - the login.css i don't even know
172:18 - login.css there we go all right
172:21 - so with that said now what we're going
172:23 - to do is we are going to go
172:24 - over to uh create this login component
172:29 - so the login component is fairly simple
172:31 - it's just gonna have a few things it's
172:32 - gonna have um
172:34 - a a container which says a login logo
172:38 - and this one is gonna essentially just
172:39 - have so if we go back to the
172:42 - actual uh build itself when we refresh
172:45 - we will have a container and this will
172:47 - have login
172:49 - logo and this one will have two images
172:51 - inside of it so they're gonna have the
172:53 - those facebook images so it's gonna have
172:55 - two images you have the facebook logo
172:57 - and then the facebook text logo
172:59 - and then we have a material ui button
173:01 - which has a sign in right so we're gonna
173:03 - have underneath that
173:04 - we're gonna have a material ui button
173:06 - which says type submit
173:07 - and so we on click sign in so it's going
173:09 - to fire off a function called sign in
173:11 - which means that we have to create that
173:12 - function
173:13 - so at this point i'm going to go here
173:14 - and i'm going to say const sign in so
173:16 - consign in
173:17 - equals and we're going to do an arrow
173:18 - function and this arrow function
173:21 - is going to basically do some clever
173:24 - sign-in stuff right
173:26 - so that should do that now this is what
173:29 - we want it to look like
173:30 - how does it look right now let's go
173:31 - ahead and check it out so let's force
173:33 - our app to render there by changing the
173:34 - user to null
173:36 - right so let's go ahead and do that and
173:38 - if we refresh this now it should go
173:40 - ahead and force the user
173:42 - to go to our new login component and
173:45 - this might fail actually because we
173:46 - haven't
173:47 - imported login there we go i thought so
173:50 - so we have to do that and we should see
173:53 - now
173:55 - it says button is not defined now so
173:57 - inside of here we need to import the
173:59 - material ui button
174:01 - there we go and we do that and that
174:03 - should go ahead and pull
174:05 - it in so there we go so you can see
174:08 - these are huge right now it's got a tiny
174:10 - button and then the massive one
174:11 - uh massive logos over here so let's go
174:13 - ahead and style this so it gets
174:15 - it doesn't look like this horrible stuff
174:17 - right now and the way we're gonna do
174:19 - that is i'm going to
174:20 - first go ahead and target that that
174:22 - image because
174:24 - with the image like that we can't
174:25 - actually see anything so i'm going to
174:26 - target the
174:27 - div i'm going to go inside the login
174:29 - container the first div
174:30 - the image and i'm going to say object
174:32 - fit contain to keep the aspect ratio and
174:34 - a height of 150
174:35 - to bring everything smaller that will
174:38 - immediately pour everything
174:39 - quite neatly in right the next thing i'm
174:41 - going to do is i'm going to go inside
174:42 - the first div
174:43 - and what i mean by the first div is is
174:45 - pretty much essentially the the
174:46 - container which contains those
174:48 - images display flex direction column
174:51 - that will actually go ahead and change
174:53 - it and now guys you see this is at the
174:55 - top of the page
174:56 - there's a neat trick to getting anything
174:58 - centered in
174:59 - vertically and horizontally and the way
175:01 - you do that is you pretty much go ahead
175:03 - and do you target the
175:04 - overall logging container you do display
175:06 - grid place item
175:08 - center and a height of 100 view height
175:11 - and it gets
175:11 - this really nice centering right
175:15 - the next thing we want to do is target
175:17 - that button so that button looks
175:18 - really nasty right now so we're going to
175:20 - target we're going to say width of 300
175:21 - pixels
175:22 - give it the facebook color and give it
175:25 - the uh sort of a white sort of
175:26 - background and font weight a little bit
175:28 - heavier but you see when we hover over
175:29 - it by default the hover functionality is
175:31 - is nasty
175:32 - we don't want it to change to that color
175:34 - we want to instead add our own colors so
175:36 - let's go ahead and add that
175:38 - here we're going to say add this color
175:40 - add a white background color and add the
175:41 - text to go blue when you do that
175:44 - so we save this now and we do this
175:47 - uh oops i've actually gone ahead and
175:49 - broke something there so i need to
175:50 - actually change
175:51 - this to be
175:55 - this right here there we go
175:59 - and now there we go so you see it's got
176:01 - a very nice ui to it and when we click
176:03 - it look at that you get a nice ripple
176:04 - blue ripple effect
176:05 - beautiful yeah i see right so
176:09 - what we can do now is we need to
176:10 - actually go ahead and that firebase file
176:13 - that we created earlier
176:14 - we're going to go into that file so
176:16 - we're going to go into that firebase
176:17 - file that we created earlier
176:19 - this one right here and what we need to
176:20 - do is we need to bring firebase into our
176:22 - project so let's go to our terminal
176:24 - and we need to do mpmi mpmi
176:27 - firebase and this will actually go ahead
176:29 - and install firebase into our project
176:33 - right it's going to install firebase
176:35 - into the project
176:36 - and then what we can do is we can start
176:37 - coding it while it's doing that so at
176:39 - the top of the file we're going to say
176:40 - import
176:41 - firebase from firebase and this will
176:43 - pull firebase modules into the firebase
176:45 - firebase variable and then we have a few
176:48 - lines so the first one is we need to
176:50 - initialize the app so this is the key
176:51 - that we got earlier this is our config
176:53 - file
176:54 - and all we need to do to connect our
176:56 - front end our react front end
176:58 - to our firebase back end is this where
177:01 - we say firebase
177:03 - equals firebase.initialize app with that
177:06 - firebase config so you just literally
177:07 - pass in
177:08 - the object right here and that will
177:10 - actually connect everything together
177:13 - and now what we're going to do is we are
177:14 - going to get access to the database
177:16 - so we're going to go ahead and do this
177:18 - we're going to say cons db equals
177:20 - firebase app so the one that we just
177:22 - initialized access firestore
177:24 - and before while we do this guys let's
177:26 - go ahead and go over to firestore and
177:28 - set this up
177:29 - so oh that's a bug on their side uh so
177:32 - we're going to go over to firestore
177:35 - and here guys we go into firestore we
177:38 - scroll to the top we say create database
177:40 - this is on firebase
177:41 - and what i'm going to do is they got a
177:42 - buggy website right now and we go
177:44 - to start test mode next we don't care
177:47 - what location it's in we click enable
177:49 - and this will actually go ahead and
177:50 - build us a real-time database on the
177:53 - backend for us
177:55 - so while that's doing that we're going
177:56 - to go back to our code and we basically
177:58 - use this and this
177:59 - variable will be what we use to
178:01 - essentially go ahead and handle our
178:03 - database stuff
178:04 - the next step is setting up our
178:05 - authentication so here we do const auth
178:08 - equals firebase so the actual firebase
178:10 - module dot auth
178:12 - and this one uh is actually going to
178:14 - allow us
178:15 - this auth is going to allow us to do
178:16 - things like logging in signing in
178:18 - and search etc now what we need to do is
178:21 - we need to go over to this tab over here
178:23 - so it says authentication so if i make
178:26 - this full thing you can see
178:27 - authentication go to sign in method
178:31 - and i want you guys to turn on google
178:33 - sign in
178:34 - so here click on enable and then you
178:37 - need to set a project support email so
178:39 - go here and let's just go ahead and
178:41 - click
178:41 - save and this will actually go ahead and
178:44 - enable the google login
178:46 - right so this is google logging in like
178:48 - this is google login service
178:50 - so what we're going to do then is we're
178:52 - going to go back to our code
178:54 - and what we need to do now is is
178:56 - actually tell
178:57 - the provider and then we need to
178:59 - actually get something called a provider
179:01 - right now firebase gives this in a very
179:03 - nice format we say equals
179:04 - new firebase.auth.google.provider and
179:10 - this will actually tell
179:12 - google this will tell firebase that we
179:14 - want the google login service
179:17 - now to access this stuff outside
179:20 - of the um outside of the file
179:23 - i'm gonna have two exports i'm gonna
179:24 - have one which is a explicit export
179:27 - which is auth and provider
179:28 - and then i'm going to have a default
179:30 - export which is a db because we're going
179:31 - to use a db in more
179:33 - circumstances where as compared to the
179:35 - other two
179:37 - so with that said
179:41 - let's go what i like about this build is
179:45 - that
179:45 - you know we're using react react is made
179:47 - by facebook
179:48 - backend we're using firebase and that is
179:51 - made by google
179:52 - and then we're using google
179:53 - authentication too so we're using
179:56 - a lot of the google's ecosystem on the
179:58 - back and then we're also using react
180:00 - which is facebook on the front
180:01 - so that's it's an amazing way for them
180:04 - to all come together
180:05 - yeah exactly it comes together so nice
180:08 - especially when we deploy it it's like
180:10 - it's really yeah it really really ties
180:13 - in together
180:15 - nice so the next step now is i'm going
180:17 - to actually move our image a little bit
180:18 - so we can see the sign-in button there
180:20 - we go nice
180:21 - so now what we're going to do is inside
180:23 - of our login.js
180:25 - we're going to have it so when we click
180:26 - sign in
180:28 - so to do the sign in stuff you would
180:30 - think we have to do stuff with tokens we
180:32 - have to mess around with all this other
180:33 - weird stuff and
180:34 - all that right but we don't all we have
180:36 - to do is we have to
180:37 - import auth and provider from firebase
180:40 - and this is our local firebase so author
180:42 - provider from our local firebase
180:44 - and then what we say is we just say
180:49 - literally we say auth dot sign in
180:52 - with pop up so sign in with pop up and
180:55 - you can see it pops up for us
180:57 - and then i'm going to use the provider
180:58 - that we just set up so the google one
181:00 - that we just saw
181:01 - and i will say once that comes back then
181:04 - get the result so whatever the result
181:07 - was
181:08 - and go ahead and basically let's just
181:11 - console.log the result for now
181:12 - where it says console.log the result and
181:15 - i also want to do something i'll say if
181:17 - there was any error for whatever reason
181:20 - i want you to go ahead and alert on
181:22 - screen
181:23 - the error message so they usually come
181:26 - back with some kind of message we can do
181:27 - that
181:28 - now frankie do you reckon that was it
181:31 - like do you think that's too easy or do
181:33 - you reckon like
181:34 - it's there must be more steps right like
181:35 - that's kind of like
181:37 - i mean they're i don't know man to me
181:38 - that was really easy i feel like
181:40 - you know there might be something
181:42 - missing but i don't know you tell me
181:45 - i mean it is insane because like we
181:49 - literally we click this button now and
181:50 - boom
181:51 - oh wait no this is the this is not this
181:54 - is not the local this is the local
181:56 - we're here and let's go ahead and
181:58 - actually hook this button
182:00 - up to our on click so we need to refresh
182:02 - so yeah
182:03 - this will actually uh oh so somebody
182:06 - said you've got to blow the air horn so
182:08 - if this
182:09 - goes in right now oh we just got uh an
182:12 - ars
182:12 - what is ars i'm not sure
182:16 - christian david dropped 100 ars
182:20 - currency let's see what that is that is
182:23 - argentinian peso argentine peso peso
182:27 - thank you so much man really really
182:29 - appreciate you really appreciate that
182:31 - he says why are we acting not vue.js
182:33 - sorry if you already answered this one
182:34 - thanks great content
182:36 - three points one the entry uh entry
182:39 - to react is much easier than any other
182:42 - sort of uh library or framework in my
182:43 - opinion
182:44 - two is the most wanted and in demand
182:46 - language at the moment
182:48 - and three it's just such a badass
182:50 - library like right now we're doing
182:51 - we're gonna be covering the mern stack
182:53 - we're gonna be covering we actually i
182:55 - mean we need
182:55 - a little like abbreviation for what we
182:57 - do like in terms of firebase
182:59 - that kind of stack i think we should get
183:01 - something trending um because
183:03 - like we have an amazing stack right here
183:05 - that we we build some really powerful
183:06 - apps off
183:07 - but yeah the main reason is it's super
183:09 - powerful the entry into it is very
183:11 - simple
183:12 - and it is the the mo in most the most
183:15 - wanted and in demand library out at the
183:17 - moment
183:18 - and that includes with frameworks as
183:20 - well so yeah 100
183:22 - definitely go and learn it nice so let's
183:24 - go ahead and click
183:25 - sign in and boom we get our little
183:27 - google sign in
183:28 - let's see if it works and what i'm gonna
183:31 - what i'm gonna do is while that's
183:32 - loading i'm gonna open the inspector
183:34 - on the uh on chrome
183:37 - oh look at that dope right
183:41 - damn damn dude so just by pulling the
183:43 - provider that you had made on that other
183:45 - what was it was it the okay i don't
183:48 - remember what file it was yeah
183:49 - the firebase js one right you are
183:51 - pulling that provider to
183:54 - the actual the authentication on that
183:56 - other
183:57 - page what is it uh so we're doing it
183:59 - over here in this one
184:00 - so in the login one okay and so that's
184:03 - what's
184:04 - being pulled and that's why it works
184:06 - just by signing in with pop-up
184:08 - and then provider right because you can
184:09 - choose different ways for that provider
184:10 - to appear
184:11 - okay on the page it can be a pop-up like
184:13 - this that's amazing man
184:15 - it's really just like clean how they do
184:17 - all of this like
184:18 - and then even when we click this now so
184:20 - no it's keep an eye down here right
184:22 - when we do sign in let's go ahead and
184:24 - make this a little bit
184:25 - bigger but it should redirect back to
184:28 - the page and it will actually go ahead
184:29 - and console.log the user
184:31 - so this is the user guys so if i go
184:33 - ahead and click the user
184:34 - you can see it has my email it says my
184:36 - display name it even has a photo url so
184:39 - this photo
184:40 - is actually a picture of me wow
184:43 - that's insane so this is all my google
184:45 - like sort of like
184:46 - user authentication stuff like this
184:48 - which is insane right like it's really
184:50 - really
184:50 - crazy that we just did this that like uh
184:53 - and also sg707 actually gave a really
184:56 - good answer he says honestly it really
184:57 - doesn't matter which
184:58 - library he goes just learn the tech that
185:01 - can get you into the company you want
185:03 - really good way of putting it so true
185:06 - man
185:06 - and also i love the way that you every
185:08 - time you implement something sunny you
185:10 - test it out
185:10 - right away so i think that's amazing and
185:13 - it helps with the speed of your builds
185:14 - and also
185:15 - just saves you a lot of headaches at the
185:17 - end of the day too 100
185:19 - dude like that's the main thing that we
185:20 - want right like we want to test
185:22 - everything we do it as we do it so
185:25 - now we have a problem though like we get
185:27 - the user at this point so
185:29 - essentially inside of here if i do
185:31 - result.user we actually have the user at
185:33 - this point
185:34 - now how do i then
185:37 - use the user at app.js right so how can
185:41 - i actually get the user here and i don't
185:43 - want to do prop drilling i don't want to
185:44 - have a piece of state and pass it down
185:46 - here and there
185:47 - so now we're going to introduce
185:50 - something called the react context api
185:52 - right now bro don't want to don't want
185:55 - to distract you
185:56 - but we're at and ninety 2195
186:00 - likes man two hundred that's insane guys
186:04 - thank you so much
186:06 - we're also at 189 dollars in chat
186:08 - donations
186:10 - whoa man 200 almost for this build in
186:13 - this build in this moment oh my god
186:16 - thank you guys so much that's insane
186:19 - that is insane guys and they love us oh
186:22 - it just broke 2 200. hey
186:26 - you guys for listening paying attention
186:27 - smashing that like button
186:29 - we really really appreciate you exactly
186:32 - guys we love you guys and we massively
186:34 - appreciate you watching and being here
186:36 - supporting us
186:37 - when we drop this value to you guys we
186:39 - just got another donation by ethical
186:41 - whatever
186:42 - uh dropping in hey 40
186:46 - rupee that's awesome dude thank you so
186:48 - much
186:49 - nice so guys with that said let's
186:52 - continue on strong so we have the login
186:54 - right here
186:55 - now we basically need a way to keep
186:57 - track of
186:58 - the user throughout the app regardless
187:01 - of what component we're in right
187:02 - so essentially imagine like we have our
187:04 - entire app so let's just say this is the
187:06 - entire app
187:07 - what we kind of want is something like
187:09 - that kind of wraps
187:10 - oops some we want something that
187:12 - essentially wraps
187:13 - everything right so it kind of wraps all
187:15 - of the stuff
187:16 - uh we just got another donation dude
187:18 - from the goblin 306
187:20 - you're doing a great job my knowledge
187:22 - increases
187:23 - thank you dude that's awesome almost man
187:26 - i appreciate that
187:28 - yes poland slothy is the is the actual
187:31 - currency for that so from poland
187:33 - i love it man thank you so much awesome
187:36 - dude
187:38 - so now what we're gonna do guys is
187:41 - essentially
187:41 - what we have here is we're gonna wrap
187:43 - the entire app with something that i
187:45 - like to refer to
187:46 - as somewhat of a data layer right so
187:48 - this is a data layer
187:49 - and this is what we refer to as either
187:51 - redux or
187:52 - in this case we're going to be using the
187:54 - react context api so they're two
187:56 - different things redux in the react
187:58 - context api but
187:59 - there's the same pattern so if you learn
188:01 - react context api
188:02 - you can use redux very very easily right
188:05 - the same pattern
188:06 - basically sunny what are you yeah were
188:08 - you gonna explain that what do you what
188:09 - do you see as a dif
188:11 - uh so the it's it's mainly the
188:13 - implementation effort
188:15 - so redux is extremely powerful but it's
188:17 - very it's much
188:18 - more difficult to implement react
188:20 - context api is extremely easy to
188:22 - implement
188:23 - uh but they both use the same pattern so
188:26 - there is overlap
188:28 - right so there's lovely overlap there
188:31 - and also context api is really i mean
188:33 - like you can do everything you can do in
188:35 - redux
188:35 - uh without the sort of plugins and stuff
188:37 - like that but yeah really really
188:38 - powerful stuff
188:40 - so with this said when we push things
188:42 - inside of this data layer
188:44 - whether we need it inside of the header
188:46 - component whether we need
188:48 - it inside the sidebar component inside
188:49 - of the widgets or inside of any of the
188:52 - children components so imagine inside of
188:53 - widgets we had another
188:55 - use case so you see like it could be no
188:57 - matter how many levels deep inside of a
188:59 - component you go
189:00 - you can actually use anything that we
189:02 - push into this data layer
189:04 - all right so when we log in so every
189:06 - time so imagine when we log in
189:08 - in the login page we push the user into
189:12 - the data layer
189:13 - yeah into the data layer so we push the
189:15 - user into there
189:17 - and then basically what happens is once
189:19 - they're inside the data there
189:20 - we can access them inside of any
189:22 - component and we also dropped a really
189:24 - really good video about all of this
189:26 - stuff guys
189:27 - so with that said you guys can actually
189:29 - go ahead and check this out
189:30 - um you can go ahead and check all of
189:32 - this stuff out inside of that video
189:34 - but we're actually going to move what is
189:36 - it called it's called something like the
189:38 - missing explanation for redux right
189:40 - we got it on our channel exactly it's
189:42 - like the missing explanation for redux
189:44 - and that's actually a really awesome
189:45 - video
189:46 - and it will take you through everything
189:47 - that you may be unaware of or
189:49 - unsure about when it comes to this stuff
189:51 - but we're going to move fairly fast
189:53 - through this part so what we're going to
189:54 - do now is we're going to essentially
189:56 - have
189:57 - something called a state provider which
189:59 - is what we sort of
190:00 - assume is the data layer essentially so
190:03 - state
190:04 - provider dot js
190:07 - and inside of here guys honestly at this
190:10 - point i want you guys
190:11 - you can copy and this will be pattern
190:13 - recognition
190:14 - uh i want you to watch that video
190:16 - afterwards and it will explain but
190:17 - i'm going to quickly run through a
190:18 - breakdown of what this code is so
190:20 - at the top we have our imports we're
190:22 - importing the context api stuff
190:24 - we're importing the user reducer and the
190:26 - use context hooks
190:28 - this is essentially preparing the data
190:30 - layer so right here we're essentially
190:31 - preparing the data layer
190:33 - the next line is essentially something
190:34 - what we call a higher order component
190:37 - and we're going to be using this to
190:38 - essentially wrap our app
190:40 - so the main purpose of this block here
190:42 - is it allows us to
190:44 - have something called a state provider
190:45 - and we basically just wrap the app
190:48 - inside of the state provider and it
190:50 - provides that sort of data layer
190:51 - functionality
190:53 - now whenever we want to pull something
190:54 - from the data layer we use this use
190:56 - state value hook
190:58 - right so a nutshell that's what we're
191:00 - doing so you guys can copy that code
191:02 - and then what we're going to do is we
191:04 - need to introduce something called a
191:05 - reducer
191:06 - so reducer.js right now reducer.js i'm
191:10 - going to keep coming back to this file
191:12 - um but and then not sure what i'm going
191:14 - to do is i'm going to drop the code in
191:16 - right now and explain it so this is the
191:19 - initial state of the reducer so this is
191:21 - what the data layer initially
191:23 - looks like so right now when we start
191:26 - off we're going to have a user which
191:27 - isn't logged in
191:28 - and then no we then have somebody some
191:31 - actions
191:31 - right we then have some actions and
191:33 - basically what these actions are is
191:35 - imagine
191:36 - we had a data like when we have that
191:38 - data there
191:39 - you can dispatch actions into the data
191:42 - there so
191:43 - and then what we do is inside the
191:44 - reducer we listen to it so we say if you
191:46 - just received an action for example the
191:48 - set user action
191:50 - then what we want to do is we want to
191:51 - return what the what the new data layer
191:53 - will look like so we're saying
191:54 - return whatever it currently looks like
191:57 - but change the user
191:58 - to whatever we passed in as a user
192:01 - payload
192:02 - inside of the action that we dispatched
192:04 - and then if we don't listen to the
192:06 - certain action we can return the state
192:07 - now
192:08 - this may be confusing it may be sort of
192:10 - uh a bit like sort of abstracted but
192:13 - you want to go ahead and check out that
192:14 - video we explain it and break it down
192:16 - really nicely but the main thing is guys
192:18 - again just look at how we use this
192:20 - that's the main thing that i want you
192:22 - guys to focus on right
192:23 - so let's go to index.js let's go
192:26 - over to index.js and inside of here what
192:29 - we're going to do is we're going to have
192:31 - we here we have the app and we're
192:33 - literally
192:34 - going to wrap the app inside of the
192:37 - state provider component
192:41 - right so we're literally wrapping the
192:43 - app inside of the state provider
192:44 - components you see it's actually
192:46 - wrapped inside of the state provider and
192:48 - then we're going to import
192:50 - the state provider from the state
192:51 - provider file and we're also going to
192:54 - import the reducer and the initial state
192:56 - from that reducer file that we just
192:57 - created
192:58 - now those three steps right
193:01 - those three steps are honestly
193:05 - so somebody says personally redux state
193:06 - management seems more logical than the
193:08 - context api
193:09 - honestly it's the same pattern it's
193:11 - actually the same pattern you're
193:12 - dispatching things into
193:14 - the uh reducer and you're dispatching
193:16 - actions
193:17 - the reducer listens to them it's the
193:19 - exact same as what we do inside of
193:21 - um inside of redux so it's essentially
193:23 - like somebody said it's like a global
193:25 - state right it's like a global store so
193:28 - that's how you prepare the data layer
193:30 - now how do we use it so let's go back to
193:33 - our login
193:34 - uh login.js so login.js let's go back to
193:37 - login.js and where we have
193:38 - this console.log we don't just want to
193:40 - console.log here but instead what i want
193:42 - to do is i actually want to dispatch
193:44 - so what we're going to need to do is
193:45 - first thing we need to use this very
193:47 - powerful hook
193:48 - so the use state value and remember that
193:50 - was the hook that we built inside of the
193:51 - state provider
193:52 - which allows us to pull information from
193:55 - the um
193:56 - the data layer so this gives us two
193:58 - things it gives us the state
194:00 - and the dispatch dispatch is like a gun
194:02 - that we can use to shoot into data and
194:04 - it allows us to shoot different actions
194:06 - we need to import these two things we
194:08 - need to import this the
194:10 - use state value hook and the action
194:13 - types
194:14 - and then what we can do is we can say
194:15 - when we get back the login we can say
194:17 - dispatch
194:19 - right we say dispatch and then what we
194:21 - can do is we can say
194:24 - dispatch the type and the type that
194:27 - we're going to use is we defined it
194:29 - inside of the action types dot set users
194:31 - we're saying set to the user
194:33 - and then we're passing the user as the
194:36 - whatever we
194:37 - got back as a response the the user
194:39 - object
194:40 - now what this does is it pushes that
194:42 - into the data layer so now we have the
194:44 - user inside of the data layer
194:46 - why is this so powerful because now
194:48 - inside of app.js
194:50 - what we can do here is we can actually
194:52 - go inside of app.js
194:54 - and do the following so now we can say
194:57 - go ahead and don't
194:58 - use some basic thing like that we're
195:00 - going to go ahead and say remember this
195:02 - first one was the state
195:03 - right it was what the store looks like
195:04 - it's what that data layer looks like so
195:06 - we're going to destructure and say go
195:07 - and get the user out of it
195:09 - and we need to import the use state
195:12 - value so we need to go ahead and grab
195:14 - that
195:15 - import use state value there we go and
195:18 - save and now what happens is we should
195:22 - actually be able to test this phone and
195:23 - this will work
195:24 - right it's funny man amman jain says
195:27 - sunny i can literally listen to this as
195:29 - if they were a podcast
195:30 - solid comes that's insane i love that
195:34 - man
195:35 - that's really awesome to hear that yeah
195:36 - well working on the walking on the park
195:38 - or something you can be listening to
195:40 - this
195:40 - yeah that's amazing dude nice
195:43 - so now what we're gonna do is we have
195:45 - the login page we're gonna click the
195:46 - sign in button
195:47 - and this pop-up pops up like we see and
195:50 - then what's going to happen
195:51 - is we are going to
195:56 - click a login thank you very much to
195:58 - latvia says sunny you're great and anna
196:00 - says you're great guys
196:02 - awesome thank you so much we appreciate
196:03 - you
196:05 - we're going to click the login and
196:06 - notice what happens now so i'm going to
196:08 - quickly explain what happens
196:09 - so as soon as i click this we're going
196:12 - to actually go ahead
196:13 - and so let's go ahead we're going to
196:16 - sign in
196:16 - we'll get back a result right that
196:18 - result if we log in successfully
196:20 - we'll have a result.user what we're
196:23 - going to do is we're going to dispatch
196:24 - the user into the data layer
196:26 - right which means that the user now
196:27 - exists inside of that data layer
196:29 - then what we're going to do is we're
196:31 - going to actually map it inside of
196:33 - app.js and we're going to say if there
196:34 - is a user
196:36 - then we're going to we should see the
196:37 - app actually load out so now if i log in
196:41 - if everything went well we should see
196:43 - the upload
196:47 - hey there we go wow it looks amazing man
196:51 - it looks clean so we actually got the
196:53 - app loading right
196:54 - now we there's a few areas where we
196:56 - actually want to use that information so
196:59 - we want to pull the user profile image
197:01 - here we're going to pull the name here
197:03 - we want to pull the name and image here
197:05 - and pull the name and image here so i'm
197:06 - going to run through the app now
197:08 - and actually go ahead and do those
197:09 - things so the first one
197:11 - is inside of header so inside of
197:13 - header.js
197:14 - let's go in and actually go ahead and
197:17 - grab the
197:19 - so i'm going to go ahead and pull the
197:20 - information for the user from the
197:23 - the store let's go ahead and do the
197:26 - appropriate import like so and then what
197:29 - i'm going to do
197:30 - is i'm going to say where we have
197:33 - the avatar so for example on down here
197:36 - we have the user's avatar
197:38 - right now we don't have a source so the
197:40 - source for this would actually be the
197:42 - user
197:42 - dot photo url and this is actually the
197:45 - picture of your google account
197:47 - so we actually be able to use your
197:48 - google account picture here
197:50 - and then for the h4 what we can say
197:53 - is this one should be the
197:56 - user.displayname so this should be the
197:57 - user.displayname if i save that now
198:00 - once we log in in the header we should
198:02 - see the photo url and display name
198:04 - i'm not going to do it just yet i'm
198:05 - going to do this all in one so you
198:06 - actually see all this stuff come into
198:08 - play
198:08 - in one go then we're going to have the
198:10 - sidebar.js so let's go over to the
198:12 - sidebar.js boom
198:16 - and inside of sidebar.js right now we
198:17 - have a set value here
198:19 - so again all i do is i pull it from the
198:22 - data layer so you can see the power here
198:24 - is immense
198:24 - because all we do is we just pull the
198:26 - user from wherever we need it
198:28 - once it's pushed inside the data layer
198:30 - right
198:31 - so now what i'm going to do is i'm here
198:33 - i'm going to go ahead and oh we just got
198:35 - five canadian dollars dude
198:37 - damn that's insane salman he says
198:41 - matt clone yet again thank you for
198:43 - everyone
198:44 - it's annoying from everyone it's
198:46 - annoying how i don't know which clone to
198:48 - work on next
198:49 - y'all got to slow down low love you guys
198:52 - hey we love that dude it's amazing thank
198:54 - you so much man we're at 186
198:57 - so we're four dollars away from breaking
198:59 - that 200 donation mark
199:01 - thank you guys so much we really
199:02 - appreciate this it's fun let's continue
199:04 - on
199:05 - let's get that energy up guys let's go
199:08 - exactly guys almost broke 200
199:11 - damn we love you guys that's insane
199:14 - love love to see that right
199:17 - so now where we have the um
199:20 - so rather than having this source right
199:23 - here we are going to go ahead and do
199:25 - user.photo url so we want to use the
199:28 - same photo url here
199:29 - and also for the title instead of this
199:32 - i'm going to say user.display name
199:33 - so this would actually be your google
199:35 - name so display name boom
199:36 - we have the name of the user logged in
199:39 - that works really well
199:40 - and actually we'll go ahead and pop the
199:42 - user into the sidebar
199:44 - the next place we're going to need it is
199:45 - inside the message
199:47 - sender.js right so the message sender
199:50 - message
199:51 - sender.js so this would actually be
199:54 - oops this would actually be and did
200:00 - message ender would be here so what we
200:01 - need to do again is grab the user
200:04 - so let's go ahead over here and pop it
200:07 - in here and then what we're going to do
200:08 - is we're going to
200:09 - import then necessary imports so let's
200:12 - go up here boom
200:14 - done and then we are going to actually
200:16 - go inside and replace
200:18 - the things that we need to replace the
200:19 - avatar here would be source
200:21 - equals user dot photo
200:25 - url that would be the user's image
200:28 - the next place that we might have want
200:30 - to have it is where we say
200:32 - we have all of this stuff and then the
200:34 - input what's on your mind
200:35 - right so where it says what's on your
200:37 - mind let's actually go ahead and pop the
200:38 - user's name in so you'll say what's on
200:40 - your mind sunny sanger what's on your
200:41 - night uh what's on your mind frankie
200:43 - it's a cherry on the top i love it yeah
200:45 - you see all these little customizations
200:47 - actually add to the entire user
200:49 - experience
200:50 - you know so with that said you guys are
200:54 - 196
200:55 - donations yeah i know man it's insane
200:58 - right what
200:59 - i'm insane right here i think you guys
201:02 - so
201:03 - down here crazy dude
201:06 - everybody's going crazy over facebook
201:07 - man wow it's looking freaking
201:10 - phenomenal and it's a giant build right
201:12 - sunny was talking about it and he's like
201:14 - he there's a user authentication on this
201:17 - one
201:18 - yeah login log out the look of it is
201:21 - pure
201:21 - like the new facebook look with the
201:23 - regular so
201:25 - it looked great i made an instagram post
201:26 - on it it's a pretty nice
201:28 - that's awesome dude yeah like oh you
201:30 - guys still got 449 people yo guys that
201:34 - is fantastic
201:35 - smash the like button if you guys are
201:36 - here if you guys like my new haircut
201:39 - and subscribe to the damn channel we
201:40 - love your face and
201:42 - break the 200 donations and let's keep
201:45 - going
201:46 - that's it let's do it
201:50 - i think this is a good question man uh
201:52 - ron dreyambani
201:53 - asks how how you can maintain the user
201:57 - logged in
201:57 - even if we refresh the page right so
202:00 - when you're using
202:01 - um the google authentication login you
202:04 - actually have to use the
202:06 - token to keep the persistence of the
202:08 - user but
202:09 - we don't cover that in this build right
202:12 - we don't cover that in this build
202:14 - because that's going to add to the build
202:15 - time and there's already quite a lot we
202:16 - need to do still
202:18 - but if you're using the username and
202:19 - password it will by default keep
202:21 - persistence
202:22 - so if you're using the username and
202:23 - password authentication with firebase it
202:25 - will by default do that for you so
202:27 - just a top tip there um and that will
202:30 - actually help you out
202:30 - we just got another donation dude we
202:33 - just crossed the 200
202:34 - mark hey thanks to deepak
202:38 - thank you guys so much deepak this is i
202:40 - think your third donation today look at
202:42 - this
202:42 - somebody somebody play the goddamn
202:46 - airhorn
202:48 - [Music]
202:51 - nice that's insane man wow
202:54 - deepak is super super active i love you
202:56 - man thank you appreciate it
202:58 - that's insane guys that's the oh my god
203:01 - i thought whatsapp status king was
203:02 - google
203:03 - [Laughter]
203:07 - because i was like oh [ __ ] google just
203:08 - sent that to chat
203:10 - nice so you can see now at the top guys
203:14 - we've got the
203:15 - um the user's image the user's name the
203:19 - user's image the user's name
203:20 - and even says what's on your mind with
203:22 - the name right so this is super personal
203:24 - to what you're doing right
203:26 - now the next thing we're going to do is
203:28 - we need to actually go ahead and
203:30 - set up the um we need to actually go
203:33 - ahead and do the firebase instance so
203:35 - this is where we actually
203:37 - uh connect the database to the build
203:39 - right
203:41 - so um frankie can you hear me or is it
203:44 - going a bit weird
203:45 - yeah i can hear you okay fine cool nice
203:48 - so now we're gonna get everything to the
203:50 - database now right yeah yeah now we're
203:52 - gonna push everything
203:53 - and so now we're gonna basically we set
203:55 - up the firestore database earlier
203:56 - and all we're going to do at this point
203:58 - is basically go ahead and
204:00 - set up our collection so now what we're
204:02 - going to do is you can see
204:03 - previously what we've done is inside of
204:06 - the feed
204:07 - what we were doing is we were rendering
204:09 - out like these manually typed
204:11 - posts right so what we're going to do is
204:13 - we're going to create a collection of
204:14 - posts so this is just like a nosql db so
204:17 - just like you're doing mongodb
204:18 - you have a collection of posts in this
204:20 - case and then the document itself the
204:22 - first one is going to be the post itself
204:24 - so we're going to have a profile
204:26 - pic and that profile pic let's go ahead
204:28 - and
204:29 - grab this one so let's go ahead and do
204:31 - this and then the next one is a message
204:34 - and i'm gonna say i am from the
204:37 - database yeah wow
204:40 - wow and then then we're gonna have
204:44 - and then we're gonna have a timestamp
204:46 - and i'm gonna change the timestamp here
204:48 - to be
204:48 - the today's date there we go uh and then
204:51 - i'm gonna have
204:52 - a username so the username in this case
204:55 - is going to be
204:57 - let's just do uh this is anger or
204:59 - something
205:00 - there we go and then the uh
205:03 - image is going to be let's go ahead and
205:06 - add the image that we have right now
205:09 - there we go so
205:12 - awesome so that should actually
205:15 - yeah ticktech asks does ads display and
205:19 - clone
205:21 - uh no thankfully not yeah this is an ad
205:24 - free build
205:26 - yeah nice so i'm gonna go ahead and
205:30 - save this so this will actually add it
205:32 - into the database so imagine think of it
205:34 - this way a collection
205:35 - is just like an array of uh objects in
205:38 - this case we have
205:39 - each document so if i added more here it
205:41 - would each would resemble a post right
205:44 - now we want to pull this in so the way
205:46 - we pull this in
205:47 - is we just set up the database before uh
205:51 - previously inside of the
205:55 - inside of
205:59 - we set up the database previously inside
206:01 - of our local firebase file so we
206:03 - actually pull that in
206:04 - like so and then what we need to do is
206:06 - we need some memory so we need to
206:07 - actually go ahead and say let's keep
206:09 - track of the post so let's create a
206:10 - variable to keep track and let's go
206:12 - ahead and create a setter
206:13 - called set posts and we're gonna set up
206:16 - this piece of state and we're going to
206:17 - give it an empty array as its default
206:19 - value
206:20 - the first thing i'm going to do is
206:22 - import this right now so i'm going to
206:23 - import the use state
206:26 - from react there we go and then what we
206:28 - need to do is we need to run a code
206:29 - run a piece of code when the feed
206:31 - actually loads but we only want to run
206:33 - it once
206:34 - so what we do to do that is use a use
206:36 - effect hook
206:37 - so this is a very powerful piece of code
206:39 - and what this does is by putting
206:41 - empty this is what we where we put
206:43 - dependencies by
206:44 - keeping this bracket empty what it does
206:47 - is it only runs the code
206:49 - once when the feed component loads so i
206:51 - here i say db
206:53 - dot collection and what this is doing is
206:55 - it's actually accessing this collection
206:57 - right here
206:58 - so posts and then what we do is we say
207:01 - on
207:01 - snapshot and snapshot is basically like
207:05 - it's a real time snapshot which means
207:07 - that when basically
207:09 - anything is updated added uh changed
207:12 - anything inside this collection it will
207:15 - give us the real time
207:17 - uh sort of snapshot or like imagine
207:19 - you've got a camera
207:20 - take a picture of it at that real time
207:21 - point and then actually go ahead and
207:23 - pull it into your code
207:24 - right so at this point what we're going
207:26 - to say we're going to say when you get
207:27 - that snapshot
207:28 - update the posts so set the posts to
207:31 - whatever the snapshot is dot docs
207:33 - so this is all of you at this point
207:35 - you'll get an array of docs you get an
207:37 - array of docs here
207:38 - snapshot.docs and then we're going to
207:40 - say don't map through every single one
207:43 - right map through every single one and
207:45 - for each dock i want to return
207:46 - a custom object with an id which is the
207:49 - document id
207:51 - so this this is the id the unique id
207:53 - here and some data and the data is going
207:56 - to be
207:57 - the doc data and doc.data is essentially
208:01 - all doc.data is is this
208:02 - this stuff right here so all i did here
208:05 - guys was i basically
208:07 - pulled in all right so let's go ahead
208:09 - and make this a little bit bigger at
208:11 - this point so you can see that
208:12 - so what i did here is i actually pulled
208:14 - in everything
208:16 - from here so it's mapped this is a
208:18 - real-time connection
208:19 - to the database in three lines of code
208:22 - there's a real-time connection and it
208:24 - maps to our state
208:25 - right so it actually maps to the state
208:27 - it's extremely performant
208:29 - and it works really really well so with
208:31 - that said now what we're gonna do
208:34 - is we are going to actually render those
208:37 - posts so right now
208:38 - we can see we've got two posts here but
208:40 - i'm going to print the donation
208:43 - man super active navin thank you so much
208:46 - man
208:47 - we really appreciate you man we see you
208:48 - on every live stream you know stick
208:50 - through it
208:51 - actually apply all of these you know
208:53 - projects to your portfolio man
208:55 - don't just you know be watching it's
208:56 - cool if you're watching it's cool if
208:57 - you're enjoying the content but
208:58 - ultimately that's where you're going to
208:59 - get the most value out of this so that's
209:01 - amazing thank you so much 100 make sure
209:05 - you definitely go ahead and do that yeah
209:07 - and sunny every time that we make a post
209:09 - then it gets fed to the database just
209:11 - automatically pretty much
209:13 - not yet we haven't done that but yeah no
209:15 - actually yes if i manually added a post
209:17 - here
209:18 - then with the snapshot would fire off
209:20 - and it would actually pull
209:22 - uh refresh our posts variable with all
209:25 - of this information right
209:27 - so what we need to do is we actually
209:28 - need to show that on the screen so
209:30 - rather than having this hard-coded stuff
209:31 - right here
209:33 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to say
209:36 - posts.map so posts oops
209:40 - posts so map through every single post
209:45 - map through every single post and return
209:47 - the following so map through oops it
209:48 - should be an arrow
209:51 - map thing right through every single
209:52 - post and return the following so
209:54 - i'm basically gonna say uh
209:57 - get the following so return a post
210:01 - uh component where
210:04 - we have the following so each of these
210:06 - things right each of these things right
210:08 - here
210:09 - is going to be post
210:13 - dot profile picture poster id
210:16 - the key here is so keys are necessary
210:18 - for
210:19 - efficient react rendering so in this
210:22 - case we're using the unique
210:23 - id here and we're passing that as a key
210:27 - if you want to know more about keys i'd
210:28 - recommend reading up on react keys for
210:30 - performance rendering
210:31 - but then here you've got the profile
210:33 - picture message timestamp username and
210:34 - what this is doing guys this is just
210:36 - mapping to the post
210:38 - image post message post profile picture
210:40 - post timestamp post username
210:42 - and what we should see now is that if
210:44 - we've done this correctly
210:47 - let's go ahead and make sure the correct
210:48 - everything's imported
210:50 - uh in the nice way there we go we should
210:52 - see now
210:53 - a message once we log in that it there's
210:56 - a
210:56 - there's a post on our feed that actually
210:59 - yeah let's remove the naveen comment
211:01 - because of the code
211:02 - oh yeah oops i actually got that yeah
211:04 - thank you
211:06 - yeah thanks to kazi he actually pointed
211:08 - it out from all the way from the bean
211:09 - bag
211:09 - hey let's go oh nice
211:14 - so yeah there we go uh so now what we're
211:17 - going to do guys
211:18 - is we are going to sign in so let's go
211:20 - ahead and sign
211:21 - in and what we should see
211:26 - yes once we sign in the post that we is
211:28 - actually rendered on the screen is going
211:30 - to be
211:30 - fetched from our firebase database
211:34 - and then it's going to be rendered on
211:36 - the screen so it's actually going to get
211:37 - a snapshot so we should see it pop up
211:39 - here
211:39 - if we've done everything correct um
211:42 - okay so see so we've something happened
211:45 - but it didn't work as we expected it
211:47 - right
211:48 - so something almost say almost did what
211:50 - we wanted so let's fix that let's find
211:52 - out why
211:52 - it didn't do what we wanted so let's go
211:54 - ahead and check out so
211:56 - here what i'm going to do is jump into
211:59 - post
212:01 - and we've got profile picture image so
212:03 - you can see here we're not actually
212:04 - using the time stamp
212:05 - so here's a little hack for you guys
212:07 - whenever you have a timestamp
212:09 - and you kind of need to pass it and show
212:12 - the actual date
212:13 - just use this snippet of code right here
212:15 - right it'll save you a bunch of headache
212:18 - you basically say new date you pass that
212:20 - timestamp that comes from firebase
212:22 - use optional chaining because it will
212:24 - defend it against if in case it's broken
212:26 - you say to date which is something that
212:28 - firebase gives us and then you say two
212:30 - utc string
212:31 - and this will actually render out a
212:32 - readable date so that's actually a
212:34 - little hack for you guys
212:36 - and then here what we're going to do is
212:38 - see you see it showed something but it
212:40 - doesn't
212:40 - show correctly right so it's a bit
212:42 - strange so the username
212:44 - is being passed in let's check out
212:47 - what's happening here
212:48 - post.username let's check in here we did
212:51 - post.username okay
212:53 - so this should be pulling in image post
212:56 - or image
212:57 - there we go don't mean to interrupt you
213:00 - man but guess
213:01 - what my bro we just crossed the 2.3
213:04 - k likes oh
213:07 - dude that's insane oh man you guys are

213:16 - insane in just three hours and 30
213:18 - minutes we reached
213:19 - 2 304 likes 200 in chat donations
213:23 - and 36 play 36 000 playbacks wow insane
213:27 - guys

213:36 - having fun all around
213:37 - thank you yeah honestly amazing and
213:40 - with that said i just figured out why
213:43 - the data wasn't rendering guys
213:44 - because exactly
213:48 - where's the thank you post because he's
213:49 - asking instagram
213:52 - 66. i know let's go i need i need that
213:56 - big thank you post coming dude
213:58 - nice so now guys inside of profile pic
214:02 - message timestamp username image because
214:04 - these are all pulled in right i pulled
214:06 - that inside of a data
214:08 - object which means that here i need to
214:10 - say post
214:11 - dot data dot
214:16 - image.profilebit.message.timestamp.username.image
214:17 - there we go
214:18 - now if i go back here what we're going
214:20 - to do is we're going to have to
214:21 - uh let's login so let's go ahead and log
214:24 - in
214:26 - my new andreas actually just said just
214:29 - join the family you guys are awesome
214:31 - nice dude hey thank you so much man
214:35 - we really appreciate you love it it's a
214:38 - family at the end of the day
214:39 - you know we're all here for one reason
214:41 - we're all here to learn we're all here
214:43 - to implement
214:44 - you know just theory isn't enough and
214:47 - really coding alone isn't enough either
214:49 - man get people around you that code
214:51 - and we're here for you if that's what
214:53 - you need oh
214:55 - damn frankie checked out oh i didn't
214:57 - save it damn it i didn't save the
214:59 - oh man okay so let me go ahead and save
215:01 - this let me go ahead and save this
215:03 - sister's
215:04 - do a refresh but basically it is pulling
215:06 - from the database now
215:08 - so let's go ahead and see so soon as
215:10 - soon as we sign in now
215:12 - if we see a message which says i'm from
215:15 - the database with a correct time stamp
215:18 - then the air horns are going to go off
215:19 - because this shit's about to get real
215:20 - because it's working
215:22 - right ready let's go
215:28 - from the database wow
215:34 - nice so you see it works guys it does
215:37 - exactly what we want
215:39 - now what we're going to do is we're also
215:41 - going to actually go ahead and add an
215:43 - additional line here
215:44 - so we want to actually order those posts
215:46 - by
215:47 - we're going to do order by
215:51 - i think it's ordered by yeah exactly
215:53 - we're going to do order by timestamp
215:56 - and we're going to do descending so the
215:57 - the most recent ones come to the top
216:00 - in this case right so that's awesome
216:04 - now what we're going to do is we are
216:06 - going to
216:07 - actually go ahead and add the
216:09 - functionality so that when we are
216:12 - when we type into the message sender
216:14 - field
216:15 - so the message sender field you see here
216:18 - when we actually hit the submit
216:20 - so let me go ahead and log into the
216:22 - actual uh deployed version
216:24 - so we can actually get this on the
216:25 - screen and it doesn't keep refreshing
216:27 - let's go ahead and login
216:36 - so now you can see what we're going to
216:37 - do our goal is right now is that when i
216:40 - type in here so like abc or something
216:42 - like that or like yo
216:43 - as soon as we hit enter and and we pass
216:45 - in maybe an image url
216:46 - it's going to push so remember
216:48 - previously i actually manually added
216:50 - this document right i manually added
216:52 - this stuff now we're going to
216:53 - programmatically do it right so it's
216:55 - going to actually programmatically
216:57 - push that information into the database
217:00 - and how do we do that we basically go
217:02 - ahead and say
217:03 - this so firstly we need to import two
217:05 - things we need to import the db
217:06 - and we're going to need to import uh
217:09 - firebase from firebase so this is from
217:11 - our local firebase this is from the
217:12 - firebase
217:13 - uh itself module itself and then here
217:16 - what we're going to say is when we hit
217:18 - the submit so when we hit the enter key
217:19 - we're going to go to the collection
217:21 - posts so we're going to go to the
217:23 - collection post
217:24 - and all you need to do guys is actually
217:25 - go ahead and say add
217:27 - and we're going to add an object and the
217:29 - message
217:31 - itself so the message inside so this
217:32 - message right here
217:34 - we're basically going to map it to our
217:36 - input
217:37 - then we're going to say the timestamp so
217:39 - the timestamp is a very clever part here
217:41 - right we say firebase
217:42 - so we don't want to use our local
217:45 - timestamps because
217:47 - frankie's timestamp is going to be
217:48 - different to mine because he's in la
217:50 - right now
217:50 - and i am in london right now right so
217:53 - our timestamps can be off
217:54 - so instead we're going to use the one
217:56 - that exists inside of firestore so we
217:58 - say
218:00 - firebase.firestore.filledvalue
218:02 - and then we say server timestamp so
218:04 - you're going to use the one that's on
218:05 - the server
218:06 - right now and that would mean that
218:08 - everyone say frankie pushes a message
218:10 - and i
218:10 - push a message it's going to be actually
218:14 - um it's going to be actually sort of
218:18 - at the uh they're going to be the same
218:20 - time right and then it gets rendered
218:21 - locally based on our machines or our
218:23 - browsers
218:24 - which is what we want so the next thing
218:26 - we're going to do is profile
218:27 - pic and here we're going to actually use
218:29 - the user's image so we're going to say
218:31 - user.photo url
218:34 - so that would actually mean that the
218:35 - user's image gets saved there as well
218:37 - and then we're going to add two more
218:38 - things we're gonna say the
218:40 - the uh the username should be the user's
218:43 - display name
218:44 - and the image should be the image url
218:47 - which is inside of that input field so
218:49 - the image url is
218:50 - this one and the input field is this one
218:54 - so if we did everything correctly
218:57 - right when we start when we type into
219:00 - this box and when we sort of enter
219:02 - it maybe an image url here and i click
219:04 - enter that should push into the database
219:07 - and then what i explained earlier was
219:09 - inside of feed.js
219:10 - this is a this is this snapshot always
219:13 - listens to any change
219:14 - and then it re-renders based on if it
219:16 - gets that change right so if we did this
219:18 - correctly and if
219:19 - i say it's true then everything should
219:22 - be
219:22 - working at this point so let's go ahead
219:24 - and sign in
219:26 - so this is pretty exciting stuff so
219:28 - let's go ahead and actually get a
219:29 - picture for this
219:30 - let's go ahead and get something like a
219:32 - let's do a funny
219:34 - gif let's see what funny gif comes up
219:36 - oops phooni
219:38 - let's go ahead and this like baboon is
219:40 - gonna come on
219:41 - right it's a low res baboon though so
219:44 - let's go ahead and drop this
219:46 - now let's do this but let's go so copy
219:49 - image address
219:50 - and then what we're going to do is so
219:53 - we're going to go ahead and do something
219:55 - that's language
219:57 - i love when he gives i know right
220:01 - so now we should log in so you see it's
220:04 - insane like the actual functionality of
220:05 - this app is pretty cool like when we see
220:07 - it
220:07 - so now our messages should load here
220:09 - awesome and then we should say something
220:11 - like
220:12 - yo it works yeah now
220:16 - i know what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna
220:17 - pass that gif in here and now
220:19 - what we should see is this image this is
220:22 - i'm logged in as my account right now
220:23 - so if i push if i hit enter now we
220:25 - should see a message pop in here
220:28 - with that image a gif and it should see
220:30 - even have my correct image and
220:31 - everything
220:33 - boom dude damn let's go
220:37 - oh my god gives coming out
220:40 - that's insane that's insane dude and
220:43 - look at that it was instant there was no
220:45 - refresh no nothing
220:46 - the date eventually sort of loaded in
220:48 - there you can see it works
220:50 - everything i love that dope dude and it
220:52 - works and this would actually work now
220:54 - even if i engrocked this and shared it
220:56 - with frankie it would actually work
220:57 - everything would actually go ahead and
220:59 - work in the way that we expect it to and
221:00 - it also supports
221:02 - without so even without an
221:05 - image this works and then we can do like
221:08 - a rocket emoji
221:12 - yeah so even if i do this it's able to
221:14 - just pull any image or give
221:16 - from the from the web right it doesn't
221:18 - actually have to be a jpeg or
221:20 - maybe or an svg notice it can do a gif
221:23 - so like it like for example
221:29 - that's how i'm that's how i am right now
221:31 - that's how i'm feeling
221:32 - yeah it's like oh my god it works
221:34 - exactly
221:35 - let's go hey
221:43 - [Applause]
221:44 - [Music]
221:46 - guys if that made you laugh smash the
221:48 - thumbs up button
221:49 - oh man so we've got the little dog sort
221:53 - of like super happy right now
221:55 - so you can see guys that's a real-time
221:58 - database and everything's working at
222:00 - that point right so we have a real-time
222:01 - database
222:02 - we have um we have authentication we
222:06 - have everything in that front and this
222:08 - is pulling in here we have react
222:09 - context api we have a beautiful looking
222:12 - design right here
222:13 - we even have a lovely little
222:16 - embed over here on the right so this is
222:18 - a really functional app right now that
222:20 - we've got
222:21 - you see it's very responsive as we pull
222:23 - in we get that lovely responsiveness and
222:26 - that behavior that we expect um
222:29 - so this is really really awesome and we
222:31 - have some nice little hover effects we
222:32 - have some hover effects over here
222:34 - everything has been accounted for in the
222:36 - way that we expect it to be
222:38 - and the functionality works guys right
222:40 - wow so
222:41 - really really powerful exactly really
222:44 - really powerful and also guys we're
222:46 - going to make it so that we're going to
222:48 - protect our
222:49 - uh our app here we're going to say if
222:51 - the input
222:54 - if the input actually we're going to
222:55 - leave that one we'll leave that let's
222:56 - keep it as that
222:57 - we'll keep it as that that's good so
223:00 - so with that said now what we're going
223:03 - to do
223:04 - is i think at this point frankie
223:07 - we just reached the deployment phase
223:10 - dude
223:11 - oh my god my favorite who's ready for
223:14 - deployment
223:15 - drop it in the comments below if you're
223:16 - pumped as nas would say
223:18 - exactly guys let us know if you're
223:21 - pumped for this deployment
223:23 - like and literally let us know if you
223:24 - want to actually go ahead and access
223:26 - this app so we're only going to deploy
223:28 - it if we hear
223:29 - if we hear this from you guys so we're
223:30 - going to show you how to go ahead and do
223:32 - this and how to actually go ahead and
223:34 - deploy this
223:35 - um but let's go ahead and prep
223:37 - everything in the meantime right so
223:39 - let's go ahead and set everything up
223:41 - to you to make this work so we actually
223:44 - set everything up in firestore
223:46 - previously over here
223:47 - so what you're going to need to do is
223:49 - open up your terminal
223:50 - and inside your terminal what you're
223:52 - going to want to do is just go ahead and
223:54 - keep the app open over here
223:56 - hey we've got people saying yes please
223:57 - deploy let's go
223:59 - go live nice
224:03 - awesome right so hey we got so we got
224:06 - everyone getting pumped up for this
224:07 - right so now what you want to do is you
224:08 - want to do
224:09 - sudo mpmi dash g
224:12 - install firebase tools right so this
224:15 - line right here is going to install
224:18 - uh i don't know if they can see that
224:19 - actually frankie um i
224:21 - i can let me see oh they might not be
224:24 - able to actually
224:25 - yeah i've just made it so that you guys
224:26 - can see this right now so
224:29 - let's go ahead and there we go nice so
224:32 - you can see so this command is is
224:34 - important and this will do is you're
224:35 - gonna have to enter your password
224:37 - i can't take that dog seriously dude so
224:41 - staring right at your soul he is he's
224:43 - like he's like
224:44 - that dude that dog is ready to deploy
224:46 - guys
224:51 - so once that's ready now what we're
224:53 - going to do is we're going to say
224:54 - firebase i'm going to log out quickly
224:55 - firebase because i need to log into
224:57 - kazi's
224:58 - account because that's the one that we
224:59 - set this up on so let's go ahead and log
225:01 - out so i'm gonna do firebase
225:03 - login and what will happen is so you
225:06 - guys are gonna need to do firebase login
225:07 - when you come to this step
225:09 - click on y if you want and then this
225:10 - will pop up
225:12 - and now all you need to do is click on
225:14 - uh the appropriate account
225:16 - click allow and it will actually
225:18 - redirect you and it will log you in so
225:20 - that's dope
225:21 - close that you go back hey
225:26 - [Music]
225:37 - and now the thing is about to be
225:39 - deployed and dark thank you for 14
225:42 - czar yeah awesome dude
225:46 - nice so the next important step that we
225:49 - need to do before we go
225:50 - live guys is we need to do firebase init
225:53 - right
225:53 - so this is how we essentially set
225:55 - everything up to go ahead and deploy the
225:57 - app
225:58 - so this step now you'll get this uh
226:01 - pop-ups you need to go down with the
226:02 - arrow keys
226:04 - tap hit the space bar on hosting hit
226:08 - enter
226:08 - and then you want to click on use an
226:10 - existing project and then here you want
226:12 - to go down
226:13 - and find the build so we're doing the
226:15 - facebook clone today
226:17 - so let's go ahead and do that and then
226:18 - what do you want to use as your public
226:20 - directory this is very important guys
226:22 - you're going to type in
226:23 - build right so here you want to type in
226:26 - build so i'm just going to make this a
226:27 - bit bigger for you guys
226:28 - so you can see this so here
226:32 - you want to type in build right so let
226:34 - me go ahead and type this in so
226:36 - build build build there we go build
226:39 - that's very important and then where it
226:40 - says configure as a single page app you
226:43 - want to type in
226:44 - y for yes because react is a single page
226:46 - app
226:47 - now once we do this we need to go ahead
226:50 - and do
226:50 - mpm run build right and this will
226:54 - actually go ahead and create an
226:55 - optimized production build so what this
226:56 - will do is it will actually go ahead
226:58 - strip all of the developer tools out
227:02 - of the react build and it will push
227:05 - everything like a really streamlined
227:07 - version
227:08 - into the build folder right so we'll go
227:11 - ahead and make a very
227:12 - fast efficient version go into the build
227:15 - folder
227:16 - and then once that's done we can
227:17 - actually do firebase deploy and that
227:19 - will actually go ahead and
227:21 - push that build bundle we call it so
227:24 - it's called a bundle when it gets into
227:25 - that really
227:26 - optimized state we can actually push it
227:28 - and then that'll go and it'll fly out
227:30 - into the web
227:31 - so now while this is happening uh
227:34 - frankie maybe let's go ahead and answer
227:36 - some questions
227:37 - and we can keep the chat going
227:40 - alexandros what's up man we always see
227:43 - you here with your plus
227:44 - comments
227:48 - everywhere even on instagram when he
227:49 - messages me there's a plus sign in the
227:52 - store
227:52 - i'm always i'm almost wondering if he
227:54 - somehow like is typing this from the
227:56 - command line
227:57 - yeah right it makes me think that is he
227:59 - a bot is he a real person
228:01 - what's up alexandros i've seen his
228:03 - instagram page
228:04 - that's awesome dude you're always
228:05 - following that's i love it we like i
228:07 - said guys we remember
228:09 - every one of you that stick around
228:10 - through different live streams
228:12 - we know you by name so you know if you
228:15 - do some funny things we'll call you out
228:16 - so exactly you're sure to behave well on
228:18 - everything that's an ugly dog
228:23 - it's like a corrupt politician in the
228:25 - body of a dog
228:30 - he's just waiting for us to deploy like
228:33 - yo james hampton says i recently
228:36 - graduated from a coding bootcamp and
228:38 - have learned
228:38 - more with react watching your videos
228:40 - than i did the entire eight weeks in the
228:42 - camp awesome stuff
228:44 - let's go that's awesome dude
228:50 - i know dude that's insane
228:57 - guys here yeah that's where the comment
228:59 - is nice it's still
229:00 - i don't know why it takes a while
229:02 - whenever we're live it takes a while but
229:03 - it shouldn't take you guys this long
229:04 - when it does this
229:06 - um let's see let's let's take more a
229:09 - little bit more questions somebody says
229:11 - can you
229:11 - can you contact sidebar facebook please
229:14 - what does that mean guys write
229:17 - intelligent questions please
229:19 - oh we just got the uh so we this is what
229:22 - you guys will get once the build
229:24 - is done right so now you see inside the
229:26 - build you'll get this static folder and
229:28 - everything is built in
229:29 - inside of it so you don't want to touch
229:30 - the build photo right but at this point
229:32 - it's very important to know if you make
229:34 - any change to your code now you're going
229:36 - to have to run npm run build again
229:38 - because it only builds that that sort of
229:40 - optimized bundle at that point in time
229:42 - so now with that done you want to go
229:44 - ahead and do
229:45 - firebase deploy so i'm gonna i'm gonna
229:48 - wait for it i'm gonna queue it up
229:50 - now frankie should we do this causey
229:52 - should we do this
229:54 - let's do a countdown guys let's go yeah

Cleaned transcript:

how's it going guys yo so today like you guys always know we're dropping fire content almost every day we try to deconstruct the top tech companies right now in the world and we're showing you how to build them so it's insane you know we got facebook for you sunny's going to teach you a little bit more about what's going on in the back and the you know everything in the back scenes so tell me a little bit about that sonny yeah so today guys we have a huge build for you guys so we actually went ahead and built the facebook clone so this is the actual facebook phone that we went ahead and built so let's go ahead and look at the actual facebook so this is the actual facebook that uh this actually built in react so obviously facebook are the creators of react they went ahead and rebooked their entire website with um with react so um here you go here's the actual facebook build and you've got the header the sidebar the middle feed and these stories and we went ahead and rebuilt it in a similar fashion and frankie what do you think of this build man it is insane one of the best builds we've seen to date sunny said he busted it out in about three hours and a half of intense work so i mean i told them that's probably like six to seven hours of somebody else's time but you guys know this is papa react here so he's bringing you great builds so that you can put them on your portfolio and actually learn everything that goes behind them as well exactly guys we've done all this for you guys and we are super pumped and i'm so happy to have frankie on today's session as well so another killer session with frankie let's go ahead and d like break down the app a little bit so we've got uh you can see over here we've got the nice little sort of header component at the top we went ahead and built that we've got a nice little sidebar and bear in mind guys this is all responsive we have a lovely little stories which is actually got a very nice little hover functionality you guys can see and if we go ahead and type in here so let's go ahead and say hey guys let's go ahead and say hey guys what's going on what's going on and i go ahead and hit enter boom we've got nice little animations there too which is really really clean really really nice and we can also support images here guys so i'm going to go ahead and quickly find an image so let's go ahead and quickly find a programming image one second guys let's go ahead and find an image and let's see if the image uploading also works and this is the demo gods against us right now so hopefully this this should work but if we go ahead and write a message like what's up guys what's up guys and then i go ahead and drop an image url over here and i hit enter boom check that out guys even supports images so that's super fast yeah super fast no response no um uh refresh you've got some nice ui elements at the top and you've got this lovely little sidebar here which is actually connected to the clever programmer page this is the actual facebook feed pulling in and guys we took it another step further and we went ahead and did something extra for you guys so we actually went ahead and added authentication to this build so if we refresh the page you can see we've got this nice facebook login page so if we go ahead and click that it will actually pop up and we're using google authentication to handle it so let's go ahead and log into my gmail account so it will actually go ahead log into google and boom we actually pause our information uses it in a bunch of different places as you can see and that's it guys we're going to be building this today let us know if you're pumped and drop a thumbs up if you are excited for this damn this is beautiful man scroll down a little bit i see that nas drop the comment and stuff right because hey people some of the people in the in the actual team were testing out this app you know to make sure that it does work and it has functionalities just like someone just showed you but yeah we were having some fun with that yeah everyone's like damn it's working dope dudes so sonny what are gonna be the tech everything tech stack all the things that we're gonna use for this build yeah good question frankie so let's go ahead and jump in and let's break down this build in terms of what tech we're going to be using so let's go ahead ahead and have a look so we have react oh damn bro donation thank you frank just dropped a tech programmer no today's my birthday wow happy birthday man happy birthday dude yeah thank you so much that's it guys we got the energy flying and we just hit 680 concurrent viewers at the moment so that's insane we love and appreciate you guys and we are super pumped to be here today so let's carry on with this breakdown guys so we have this is the tech that is going to be used in today's facebook clone build so we have react obviously powering everything so react the irony here is react was built by facebook and we are now building a facebook group with react so pretty cool we're going to be using react hooks so we're going to keep everything up today hey somebody's actually jumped in here guys please keep this clean otherwise i'm gonna have to check take it off the screen um so make sure you keep this thing clean but you guys this shows you it's a realtime functionality going on um so we've got the react context api so if anyone's wanting to learn the redux pattern then make sure you stick around because we will be showing you how to use the react context api and in particular we're going to be capturing the user when they log in with that uh with that api so that's going to be cool also material ui is going to be used to go ahead and capture all of these so all of these icons that you see over here hey frankie check this out we've got people dropping uh things right in there nice so we've got all of these icons all of these different elements like these avatars we use material ui to go ahead and power that we're going to be using flexbox to make things very responsive to get everything in this realtime fashion we are going to be using the firestore database which is a realtime database provided by firebase and we're also going to be using firebase hosting which is how i actually got this thing deployed so that's awesome uh and yeah and we're going to be using google's authentication to go ahead and power the entire thing so that's pretty exciting we just got another donation exactly what i was going to say pablo bless thank you so much man he says thank you guys so much you are the best nice awesome thank you so much i know that a lot of people ask actually ask about authentication it's a great thing to actually add to your portfolio you know a lot of companies want to know that you're able to make authentication systems so we got you exactly we got you yeah we got some nice funny little gifts being popped in right here nice also guys actually we also added one more thing we added a little bonus for you guys we added a react flip move and what this does is i think it's called flip move it gives you that nice animation so if i go ahead oh so frank just typed in if i go ahead and say yo like as soon as i hit enter here guys you see how it pops in all smooth like we've got that working everything works super clean uh so we're gonna go ahead and show you guys frankie what'd you say should we jump into this build let's go right ahead i'm just taking an instagram story right now make sure to tag us guys if you're enjoying this build our instagram handles are on our actual picture on the photo you guys see so make sure to tag us and we'll make sure to follow up with you exactly make sure you guys go ahead and tag me and frankie we love to have a conversation with you guys afterwards and it's super cool because we'd see more than a number when we see you guys go ahead and involve us like that so nice let's go ahead and start this build frankie so let's go nice let's do it so the first thing someone i think nice dude i'm not the only one getting a clean fade so gonna be some exciting stuff like that exactly so right so with that said guys we're gonna actually go ahead and i'm going to just hide this window just for now in case something doji pops up so right now guys what you want to do is we're going to open up our terminal and the first thing that we're going to do is go ahead and use mpx create react app so create react app and we're going to call the app let's just call it the facebook clone so fb clone right now that's going to go ahead and use the create react app tool to go ahead and set up a react starter template so this is what we use in every single one of our builds and it's going to allow you to get started off in a very nice and quick way while that happens let's go ahead and donation by the show while that happens thank you so much man we see all you guys we remember all you guys so thank you for being here for multiple streams michelle i know that's a familiar face thank you man nice i love seeing people like that you know who come back to the thing that's not that's nice dude um awesome let's go ahead and actually check someone got sonny is a bot who makes these amazing bills daily and never gets tired guys you do get tired you know but it's awesome we do this for you guys and we love it right frankie yep after practice and practice it just ingrains in you and this is why sonny is such a master with react and him doing these builds daily is just building up his skill set even more and more so imagine in the future guys exactly guys and that's what we're trying to show you guys even if you get stuck or you feel like it's a bit tricky just go ahead and build it alongside us and pattern recognition with every video you're going to get a little bit better right so let's go ahead and actually set up firebase while we wait for this so firebase is a suite of tools provided by google and what can you do with firebase frankie so firebase lets you host all the data that you want inside of google's is it firestore yeah it's all google's ecosystem so the cool thing about it is that you don't need a sql database to run all these things and if you're doing anything you know kind of like personal projects firebase has has you handled you don't need more than that honestly exactly so with firebase you can have a realtime database you can have a uh you can host the app you can do a bunch of machine learning cool stuff and things like that with it so it's basically just a set of tools that we're going to use but we're actually going to be using the database and the hosting capabilities so the first thing you do is click on create a project and go inside and type in let's just type in facebook clone like this go ahead and click continue and then you want to click on so we're actually going to enable google analytics for this project let's go ahead and do clever programmer you don't need to enable google analytics as an extra step frankly we just hit over 820 concurrent viewers wow let's get that to 1 000 guys thank you all for being here this is awesome man can i see that michael jones just dropped on the comments he says tomorrow build a world clone with react for beginners hey nice somebody like that after all of this somebody just says i have maxed out my firebase well gmail accounts are free guys so what i'm going to say is create another gmail account and add another set of apps to that um there we go awesome right so there we have it guys on the left side you can see down here where it says cd uh firebase clone it says happy hacking so once you get that message very important step you want to make sure you cd into the correct folder uh we're using oh my zsh that's why it looks a little bit different so if you're not using that i recommend you go ahead and check it out um so go ahead and do that and then with that said guys we're going to go ahead and do mpm start and mpm start will go ahead and spin up the app for us on localhost 3000 so if you've done this correctly and everything was done in a nice oh damn frankie check out the donation we just drove amazing kenny hank thank you so much man hi guys awesome work there's there's a way to get the source code after every session yep so we're gonna be dropping the github repository on the description below after the actual builds exactly stay tuned for that we'll be dropping it in the and the link will be in the description afterwards we've got another one from vinayak and nirvani he didn't leave a message he just dropped two pounds thank you so much dude amazing stuff and another one by stealth destroy holy crap dude thank you so much just giving donations and leaving like bosses love it thank you guys we appreciate it nice thank you guys awesome uh somebody goes i hope clever programmer will clone up work soon yeah we will be probably we can clone that that'll be that'll be fun yeah nice right so now guys what we're gonna do is we have if you get to this screen then it's a very good starting point right so with that said you want to go inside your folders you will get see this new folder at the top stitch which says facebook clone click inside of source and we want to do a clean up process so this is what we do in every at the start of every single build and what we do is we go ahead and delete the app.test.js delete the logo.svg and delete the setup test.js you want to go ahead and get rid of those files because we don't actually need those files so let's go ahead and do that move to trash done let's go ahead and close this one for now as well actually we can save this and close it there we go and then why is that why is that done all the time in the beginning of the builds why do we yes yeah because as you guys know i'm a super beginner in coding so i'm gonna try to you know ask a few questions here from a beginner's standpoint hopefully sonny can answer them and give you guys a little bit of insights with that yeah good question so the reason why we do that is because we don't actually want anything on our on our build initially we want like a clean like canvas imagine you're about to paint something you don't want anything on your canvas right you want it to be completely clean so that's why we go ahead and delete those files and then we actually want to go here delete this and do like a h1 which says let's build the facebook clone the facebook clone and let's go ahead and change this to an a because we will be using something called the bem naming convention so this is a css naming convention if you guys don't know what this is i recommend you learn it because we do this in every build and it helps you build your apps and scale up so we're going to also delete the logo save the file and with that said you should see the following so now if we make this full screen you can see i've because initially if it would be like this right it would have kept away and it's this would be centered so what you want to do is two steps you want to make this a lowercase a then you also want to go over to app.css and what we like to do guys is we want to get rid of all of the styling right so app.css go ahead and delete everything so delete everything inside of app.css open up your files again and go to index.css and can you guys see this like imaginary sort of spacing that they add at the top so there's like this this is margin at the top right so this margin over here we want to get rid of that so what we're going to do to get rid of that is we're going to go here and we're going to say exclamation um sorry asterix and then we're going to say margin 0. and this will make sure that we don't see any invisible sort of any invisible sort of margins being added to our build so with that said we actually go ahead and get a clean slate we get a clean canvas and this is going to be the start point of the app so if you reach this point that is awesome guys you can give yourselves a a nice pat on the back frankie just shut off the air horns because because nice we have 800 people guys 800 people watching this is awesome amazing yeah now we're up to 658 likes thank you guys so much about to reach the 700 mark please leave a thumbs up if you guys are enjoying this build we love you yeah exactly all we ask guys is you smash the thumbs up if you're excited for today's build nice um so the first step we're also going to do is we just set up firebase right so we did this whole step right here we're going to click on continue wait until this loads up and then you want to click this little web icon over here so you want to click that type in the facebook clone and you also want to tick this little option right here click on register app and then once you get to this point you can pretty much go ahead and click on next we don't need to worry about that step here we will need this but we will do this afterwards and then we can click continue to console now once that's done guys you want to go to this little cog over here click on project settings and then scroll down to here where it says firebase sdk snippet click on the config so click on this button right here and then you basically want to grab this config over here so you want to click this little copy button so to copy it or you can just grab it like this and command c and then you want to basically go ahead and do the following so go ahead in your source folder and create a file called firebase.js right and what i want you guys to do is just go ahead and paste that config inside of there and the reason being is because we are going to be needing this file and this config file to actually go ahead and set everything up later on so i actually saw a good question that i wanted to pin um it was actually from somebody called code with ven he says sonny please i got a question is it safe to put your firebase config on the front end so he's actually talking about this config right here guys it's actually a very good question and it is safe it is safe i know we're used to thinking about like oh you should hide your config but it's completely safe to do it firebase do you have some protective security measures in place so it's actually safe to go ahead and share that that's why we're not hiding it um oh just got a donation theta 45 finance damn beautiful man he says can't believe this is free wish i had this when i was younger i i wish the same thing man you know that's really why we're making these builds you know even sunny even qazi says this say this all the time you know we wish this was out for us when we were younger so that's really the reason why we're doing it for you guys now yeah exactly i know and it's so true like guys i wish wish there was like this level of tutorials on the internet when i was learning to code and like frankie can vouch for me as well like it's it's just like a game changer in terms of space and it's just boring watching like you know reading those text tutorials so we like to see something and build something so yeah that's why energy exactly the best thing is that it's for free so really put it in your portfolio guys put in the work exactly and also guys just wanted to mention before we actually go ahead and carry on is that firstly we just hit over 900 viewers concurrently so that's insane we love you guys and also if you're enjoying this content guys make sure you go ahead and pause the chat pause the video right now or and go to the description we are offering a free one uh one hour training so it's a free webinar where we actually teach you the top three mistakes to avoid when let's go ahead and drop it on the screen the top three mistakes to avoid when becoming a javascript developer is completely free and there there's a link in the description go sign up for that now and then let's carry on the video that's nice beautiful and we got a donation by stealth destroy thank you so much what did he say lazy load and right panel great job live builds kudos awesome dude thank you so much nice man dude i think we might break a thousand views this is insane nice yeah i will we broke the 800 likes man oh my god we surpassed the 700 we're now at 816 818 thank you let's go nice dude let's go on to this build let's go so what we're going to do at this point so we have our config file set so the first thing that i like to do guys is actually sort of mask out the app right so let's go ahead and look at the sort of so this is the facebook clone app right here so let's go ahead and quickly sign in so we can go ahead and see it so this is the build that we deployed earlier so i'm just going to sign in and then we're going to use this to mask out what we're going to build in our app all right so as you can see we have a few things inside the actual app so let's go ahead and make it a little bit bigger and let's go ahead and make this more so we have the header component right so we have this header component up here so this thing right here and what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and just mask it out so down here i'm going to go ahead and say the header component oh another donation go ahead frankie what did i say okay it says capti saying awesome work guys any thoughts on electron gis js um electron i think uh what you use to make desktop apps with react right so i mean it's it's awesome awesome uh like it's an awesome sort of thing to use if you're gonna i think slack was actually built using electron so it's very very promising um in terms of what i think of it i mean i guess we're just gonna have to try and we're gonna have to start building some stuff with it to go ahead and get a better insight but yeah it's definitely promising i know a lot of big companies use electron js especially you know right now tech companies that are very you know uh what is the word prestigious or whatever they do use electron js on their stack but we might visit it on a later note and we also got another donation by shubham at deb thank you so much man 40 indian rupees appreciate you it says hi sonny sir i'm software developer hey probably see you dude exactly and guys we have over 900 software developers in this chat right now because every single one of you guys are here right now i'm going to call you guys you guys are software developers if you're here this is the start of your journey nice donation oh my god great job guys thank you so much man i appreciate you raining donations today you guys are bringing in so much love nice dude so we've got that header component that we spoke about and then we essentially have everything underneath right so everything underneath is essentially damn it guys don't do this don't spam the chat yeah i have to block it and not even share with you guys if you guys start doing that because it doesn't make it easy for us to share if you guys do that so please keep it clean we're all trying to learn exactly guys please keep that stuff clean so now what we're going to do is we're going to actually go ahead and this would be the app body so we're going to have a section called app body so this is going to say app body like so and then inside the app body we're going to have a few components right so we're going to have the sidebar right we're going to have the feed right so we have the sidebar on the on the left side here so this stuff right here is the sidebar we have the feed in the center right and the feed consists of a bunch of different things it has this like lovely little stories part as this message component and then it has the rest of them posts down here and then we have the widgets on the right okay so we have this widgets section over here so over here we pretty much have this live feed which comes from cleverprogrammer facebook itself so that will be on the right so widgets and so you're using facebook api for this then um so the stuff that you actually go ahead and see on the right we're actually using uh let me go ahead and make this full screen so the stuff that you got you saw on the right was actually using something called an iframe so it's actually an embed from facebook itself and they provide that and you can go ahead and use that for free so we're going to show you yeah we're going to show you guys how to go ahead and do that awesome so with that said we are going to go ahead and start this thing so let's go let's go to the the app and the first thing we're going to do guys is build the header component because the header components a very visual component it'll be very easy to see what we're doing so this thing right over here at the top right so the first thing we're going to do is we're actually going to go ahead and go to our files and we're going to create a header dot js component like so and then inside of here we're going to do rfce and you see we get this nice little snippet which builds out the component for us if you want to know how we get that go over to the extensions here and type in es7 and it's actually the first one it's a very popular library it's called es7 react redux graphql snippets and it's this one with 1.7 million downloads you want to make sure that you go ahead and download that and it will allow you to get those little snippets that we're doing throughout our builds so that's nice and now with that said we want to every time we create a new component we're going to go ahead give it a class name so like this it's going to say header and we're also going to go ahead and do the following we're going to say import header dot css and what we need to do then is go ahead and create the appropriate css file like so and that's going to be a step that we repeat we rinse and repeat that step guys so we're going to keep on doing that step over and over whenever we need to create a component so get very fast doing that save you a lot of time we just got another donation frankie wow dot net sean what's up microsoft teams slack even your vs code is based on electron wow so all of those technologies use electron thank you for the information man appreciate it nice wow oh damn i didn't know vs code was built in electron apparently that's nice insane that's awesome damn dude so we're coding in react which elektron uses oh man it's just this is some inception right now inception yeah yeah we just got another donation another copyright would be happy yeah another donation yeah suraj thank you so much man he says you guys are awesome good going on awesome another one dude by anker gupta wow this is so much same thank you where we are in the chat donations right now we're at we just crossed 30 dollars in chat donations thank you we appreciate it that's insane thank you guys awesome so let's go ahead and build that header component so the first thing we're going to do is go over to the header component itself and we need to go ahead and build it out so the header is actually split into three different areas right so we have the sort of center we have the left and we have the right right got another donation thank you so much frankie go ahead and read that one out while i annotate md he says you guys are building the project that i wanted to see learn a lot from you thank you thank you so much man i know that you know facebook new version hasn't been gone hasn't been out for a long time so it's even that much more surprising you know i myself don't even use a new ui as of now but you know maybe after this build i'll start using it exactly dude exactly so oh it's another donation holy crap it's raining donations dude fun with sanji thank you dude appreciate you nice [ __ ] so the header component guys is split into three different and another one damn dude don't let us code yeah i always wanted to work on a potential startup idea sonny inspired me thank you guys wow oh man thank you dude i love seeing stuff like that the whole team is we were involved in a startup too right yeah so i actually was involved in yeah i actually have worked for a couple of stops and i had my own startup for a while and i actually teach a bunch of this inside of the profit javascript course link in the description and we actually go ahead and talk about all of those things talk about the experiences that i ran into and all those things and how you guys can sort of skip that headache and just become streamlined into sort of doing well and succeeding in what you're doing so yeah really interesting stuff right there that'll be awesome dude talk about that yes so guys jumping back to the code so the header component we split it into these three areas we had header left header middle and header right so this is what you want to do when you essentially go ahead and um oh damn it dude some people are like blocking this in the chat there we go guys it's gonna i'm telling you it's gonna get it's gonna get spammed or i might just take the website down if that happens so let's keep the chat clean nice so here what we're gonna do is we're gonna do a header left so we're gonna do header left like so and then we're gonna have a header middle so div header oops header middle and if the reason why i'm typing this way is because this is the bem convention so it's inside the header component and we're using the middle element the left element and we also need to do the right element so we're going to say div dot header right so as such right and if you're wondering how i'm doing these shortcuts it's using something called emmet so emma is something another donation wow says is php still relevant is facebook still run on php do you want to answer that frankie um so it used to use php once it begun but now it's using react so they developed react out of you know solving their own problems and they brought the world with this amazing library and now we're using it to build facebook itself exactly guys yeah so they actually the app that we showed you earlier which was built by facebook themselves they revamped the entire app in with using react um so some of their pages might be using php still so there is still a chance that some of their pages are using php but i wouldn't say it's the relevant thing that you should focus your time on focus your time on javascript react that's going to bring you the most value we have another amazing donation by dover keen and what do they say frankie it says is there a react native coming soon coming someday soon yes dude we have react native content coming soon you know how we do it we listen guys i love i love mobile development man and hybrid when i learned about hybrid development i was like whoa that was what that was that was the thing that was missing from the industry and now you know you can use react to even build this using react native so that's amazing and beautiful you guys are going to be seeing that in the future no doubt exactly and then you can actually deploy your apps onto the app store and we can see who who gets the most popularity that'll be awesome to see nice dude with just under a thousand viewers this is insane oh my god oh let's go so much we just got another donation now he says sandy mena he said he's sending a dop 500 i don't know what dop is if you guys know what currency is dropped in the comments he says guys you have the best content thank you man so much we are at 51 in chat donations at the moment insane thank you so much guys thank you so so much i saw somebody was asking a question about why we have the underscores that is known as the bem naming convention just to clarify for those of you who missed that so we have these three sections header left header middle and header right uh what we're going to do is we're going to drop an image into the top so the image is going to be the actual facebook logo so this is the facebook logo right here so you can go ahead and just copy that and if we go ahead and refresh our page we should actually see oh we're actually pulling in our components so we built this header component but we actually need to go ahead and use it so we can get rid of this uh annotation we can just do the following we say this and guys shortcut for you if you go to the end of the header text and you actually press command control spacebar you get the auto import ability so that doesn't always work but if you can get that working it's a very nice little shortcut frankie we just hit over a thousand viewers dude whoa in a thousand likes at the same time they're saying d.o.p is dominican pesos thank you guys so much appreciate you guys very on top of it love it yeah i was in the dominican before lockdown so that that's awesome thank you so much dude nice so let's go ahead and you can see that's huge right now right so we actually don't want to have this massive image so let's go ahead and make that a little smaller so it's a bit easier to work with and the way we're going to do that is we're going to go ahead i'm just going to make this a little bit bigger at the moment so i can see a bit more of what i'm doing so let's go ahead and actually style this a bit so what we're going to do is we're going to go to that image and we're going to target it and we're going to say inside of the header left so let's go to our header.css and we're going to say inside of header left like so inside a header left inside of the image we're going to say give it a height of 40 pixels so a height of 48 pixels and as soon as we save that you'll see that the facebook logo then shrinks a huge amount so that's going to allow us to actually go ahead and see it in a much more easier way is that some sort of standard like 40 pixels for logos no no no i actually just went ahead and matched it to a close sort of comparison to what they have on their site beautiful yeah so a lot of this is done using the inspect tool and checking what they're using and things like that um nice so that's the header left uh we also have a search icon right so the search icon that you guys see at the top left inside of the facebook clone that up here on this top thing right here so we're actually going to go ahead and build a custom search icon search yeah search field for ourselves and in order to do that we're going to need material ui library to get all of these funky icons that you see over here and even these side ones and the way we do that guys is as i go over to the website frank you want to explain quickly what material ui actually is awesome so material ui is a library for css and the cool thing about it is that it's one of the most popular css libraries um i think bootstrap is one as well right and so the cool thing about it is that it brings really really pristine really nice and clean icons that developers can use so you can just go to their website just like sunny is doing right now and he's actually getting the snippets of code and then you can start using them on your projects really just like that exactly exactly guys so this is going to give you a bunch of components a bunch of styling layout components as well as a really really useful icon library which is what we're pretty much going to be using it for today but what you need to do is go ahead and install the core so the first thing we're going to do is go ahead pop open our terminal and what i like to do guys is actually open up a second terminal so you don't actually close your running instance of react so we actually got that running on the first terminal go ahead and make sure you're inside the directory so do facebook clone get inside there uh oh damn dude check out check out the donation man check out the albert donation hey sonny you have become a father figure to me dude i mean i mean i'm 25 i'm 25. i'm a young dad let's go let's go baby i'll let me know son yeah i'll let madman know we have we have children already you guys can adopt them yeah yeah exactly that's awesome dude hernan gimenez actually just joined us a few minutes ago as well that's awesome dude if you're watching let us know that's insane dude thank you so much fernand nice so what we're going to do now is we're going to go over to this and we're going to say mpmi and we're going to do npm install oh sorry i've already done that so let's go ahead and cancel that command let's do npm install material i ui core and then what i want you guys to do is go to the search bar type in icons go down here and what you'll see is you'll get this other command right so you're going to wait until the first one is finished and once that's done we're going to go ahead and do npm install material ui icons so let's go ahead and wait for that till that's done um and what i want to tell you guys is so we need to run this command once this is finished installing so we just added the core there and we're going to do this material ui icons and while that's installing guys make sure you click this you can where it says you can search the full list of these icons so click that and let's go ahead and check it so now you get this very very nice like sort of search so this icon search tool right and here if i go ahead and type in search for example you get like a nice little search icon click it and you get the import code for it so that's how we actually go ahead and get a lot of our icons we go ahead and use this tool and it will actually go ahead and give us the code to pull that into our project look at this sonny yeah aditya burma says man you changed my life i got a job after you're completing your projects also i'm teaching react js for free and already got two students anyone can email me at aditya burma821845 gmail.com that's on the chat wow man you got a job dude i'm just trying to find that where is that holy crap beautiful it's a little bit up it's just one of the comments but amazing man we're so proud of you guys this is the power of these builds this is the power of taking action building them and putting them on your portfolio not only that but also applying to jobs using them so yeah test out your abilities to test out your skills i mean we're providing this for you guys but there's only so much we can do for you and you know we love it when we hear and listen to all of your guys's stories i'm so pumped from you aditya thank you so much man thank you for sharing that's insane we love you guys and massively appreciate you sharing that thank you so much dude closer to our goal of 5 000 developers this year so that's another one to the list thank you guys so much i know right we need to keep a solid track of this dude because it's insane like every single live stream hearing people get jobs it's it's just mindblowing guys um yeah so keep it coming we love that positivity nice so this is the so we just installed the icons right and this is the search tool that is which is how we actually go ahead and get it so with that said let's hop back over to our local host over here so let's go back to our local host and inside the middle div what we're going to do is we're going to actually know inside the header left div we're going to go ahead and add a second div called header input and this is going to be responsible for actually having all of this stuff involved around that input field so we're going to have a search icon and an input field so search icon and an input field go ahead and save that and here if we actually see it says search icon is not defined so if i go ahead and i need to actually import this so let's go ahead and import this into our project so we can say go to the top and you can say import search icon for material ui once we save that another donation sunil 100 indian rupees thank you so much angular reactor view and please make a video on javascript basic and advanced yo we do have a javascript basic and advanced course on youtube right now it is seven hours long check out the channel and angular reactor view what do you think sonny i will definitely tell you react guys and it's not just because i couldn't react i have tried the others view is pretty good don't get me wrong angular i wouldn't i wouldn't really go down that route but react is the one to go for guys it's the most wanted language right now it is the highest paying language as well out of the three frameworks make sure you go ahead and use that and guys we will also be dropping so frankie just mentioned the seven hour video that we have on javascript we'll also be dropping a very very long one for react also at some point 12 hours yeah about 12 hours and it's going to be all the builds condensed it's going to be your ultimate guide to becoming a react developer so if you're pumped for that what can they do frankie they can go ahead and smash that like button and make sure that it turns blue thank you guys so much and if you guys want to learn even more on how to become a javascript developer hit the link in the description below it's going to show you to a onehour training where we're going to show you exactly just that and also we just got another donation by karuna thank you so much we appreciate you it's 40 indian rupees thank you and she has a little funny chicken saying hey you hey awesome dude love that thank you so much karuna nice so with that said guys we're gonna go ahead and carry on so we've got the search icon the input text and you can see this isn't looking too great at the moment but we're gonna style this we're gonna make it look really nice at the end uh we've got another donation by sunil bahira he says one video on react server side rendering oh that's actually really interesting dude i can't actually pin it for some reason um but that's a really really interesting one uh we will we will actually consider doing that so i'm going to go ahead and pop it on the screen so you can see one video on react server side rendering um so next js or something like that we can actually probably go ahead and do something like that that'll be awesome yeah so we're going to go ahead and inside the center now inside the center so the center is where we have all of these icons right so we have all these icons right here and what we're going to do is we're going to actually for each of those icons i'm going to go ahead and create a div and i'm going to say each of those divs are going to be header underscore underscore option so they're going to be each of them is going to be an option and inside of it it's going to have an icon so in this top one we're going to have something called the home icon so let's go ahead and import that so the way we write that is as such we say home icon font size is large and i'm just going to go ahead and pull in a bunch of these icons right now for you guys so there we go i just pulled in a few icons so we can use them later on but you can see now we just actually went ahead and pulled in this little lovely icon right here so sagar dumbbell thank you so much just dropped another donation appreciate that dude thank you so much man we appreciate that you guys are going crazy with the donations thank you guys so much man yeah this is awesome this is really awesome so we added we added the search loop thing on on the the what is it called the magnifying glass and then the actual home icon as well right exactly exactly that so we added that and then we added the uh magnifying glass and then we added the home icon right so you can see we're going to follow this convention so i'm going to go ahead and copy this and you see now we've got another div with the class name of header option let's go ahead and drop that down and here where we've got the home icon i'm going to change this one to a flag icon and the flag icon will simply represent this flag right here okay so this flag that you see right here that will be this one over here so i'm going to go up to the top and i'm going to go ahead and import that and we actually did import that earlier with this line of code right here so going back down save the file and you should be able to now see a flag pop in so i've actually got a snippet of code which will save us a little bit of time and i've done this for the remainder of these uh icons so there's three more icons that we do this for and they are as such there's a supervised user circle icon honestly these names i actually don't know these names where why they call them this but this is the names that you're gonna have to import and the import code is here for them so this will go ahead and pull in the required dependencies that you guys will need now with that said we are going to go ahead and finish and chuck the remainder of the stuff inside of header right so we're basically positioning ourselves at this point so we're putting all the stuff on the page and then we've got we're giving everything appropriate class names and then we're going to go ahead and add some nice little css to this so on the app we can see we've got this top section where it has here on the here we have the um let's go ahead and make it a little bigger so we have the info so this i'm going to actually sort of containerize this a little bit and i'm going to have it so that this is actually a container of its own and this one we're going to call the header info and then we're just going to list out the rest of these icons so each one of these ones is an icon so you've got one two three four different icons over here so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go over here back to our app and we're gonna go ahead and create a div which says header info so div header info as such and inside this one we're going to have two things we're going to have an avatar component so the avatar component is one of my favorite components it saves you a bunch of headache from whenever you need an avatar inside of your app so that little circle profile picture that you always need inside of apps to get it you just need to do this import and then you can actually go ahead and just use it as such and it just takes a source but right now we don't have a source so i'm just gonna it has this nice little placeholder in the meantime and then what we're going to do is we're going to have a h4 right so underneath it we're going to have a h4 and this one is just going to say for example let's just say right now it says sunny sanger like this right or for now let's just chuck in the insta handle so there we go this is anger nice so it doesn't go too long there we go and now we have that in place and we're going to add those icons right so we have icons like the add icon we have the ad icon the forum icon so all those icons i showed you guys previously basically notice how when i click them they're actually clickable buttons and the way we do that is we actually use a component called icon button and the icon button component is actually an awesome component it's got another donation thank you so much and meet kumar that's it appreciate that dude thank you so much man we really love you guys that's insane dude thank you so we've got another donation there and then we're going to basically go ahead and pop in the following so the way we do it is we pull in the icon button component and then we just wrap that around the add icon component so we're going to go ahead and add import these two extra imports at the top so we need the avatar and the icon button um so we need the following so let's go ahead and pull this in so at the top of the file we're going to go ahead and drop this import right here so there we go there we go we actually impose the rest of the dependencies that we need so awesome so for you to use all of those icons you first have to import them make sure you remember about that guys something is not functioning it's probably that if it's your icons related to that exactly and you'll get an error on the screen if that happens so make sure you keep an eye out for that so now i'm going to go ahead and pop a snippet in right here so these are the rest of the icons and you can see when we do that now you can see they're clickable elements so you see we've got clickable little beautiful icons right here but this entire thing does not look like a header right now okay so we're going to make it look like a header and the first thing we're going to do is make sure you've given the appropriate class name so we've got header header left header input in the middle you see all of these class names are actually very important for the next step we're going to go ahead and get rid of the h1 which says let's build a facebook clone because we don't want that let's click save and let's go ahead and start this so inside of the header what i'm going to go ahead and do now is target the header and this bit i love right because as we do this next step you can actually dynamically see everything pop out on the screen right which is a really really nice thing so a lot of people are saying will the video be recorded and uploaded yes all our videos are uploaded straight away afterwards and you guys can watch them back at your own pace so if you have to go you have to watch anything make sure you smash the thumbs up button and come back a different time so what we're going to do now is we're going to add a display let's add a little bit of let's add a display flex first so let's go ahead and do this display flex and this will go ahead and make everything go into a row so now we've got the header left the header center and the header right in a row now that's why it's dropped like that and then what we need to do is add a bit of padding so i'm going to say 15 pixels and what this does guys is it adds 15 on the top and bottom and it adds uh 20 on the left and right oh we just got a nice donation wow daniel bastos a hug from brazil thank you guys so much i know a lot of you guys are from brazil a lot of them are from spanishspeaking country so hola como estantos mucho gusto gracias por estara and thank you damn dude that's insane a bit of spanish for y'all qazi just dropped a message he goes you guys live right now uh maybe i think i think we're live yeah i think i think yeah i think we're live i think we're doing pretty good right now we're live nice so we added a little bit of padding and then what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and add in the following so we're going to say justify content space between so this should actually push all the elements apart from each other so let's go ahead and save and you can see it pushes all of the elements away from each other oh we also got another donation from nishan patel he goes you guys are doing a superb job helping so many people learn new skills thank you dude appreciate that massively that's awesome dude thank you man really really appreciate you nishant love it yeah this is awesome dude uh and my comments have finally come back in so i can see nice so now what we're also going to do guys is we're going to make the top uh sticky which means that so let's go back to the upright oh oops okay that's bad somebody guys please don't post in uh things like that in the chat let's go ahead and just do see yeah guys keep it clean come on yeah we are all learning here we want to show you guys the real demo but we're going to have to bring it down if you guys are not you know being respectful for everybody's teachings exactly guys let's go ahead and keep it clean so right now for the app we have this um where is it i'm talking about we have the yeah so the actual top bar sticks to the top of the page right so we want to also do that so we're going to do position sticky and set a background color of white and a z index of 100 so it never gets overwritten by any other component so let's go ahead and do this nice and then with that said we're going gonna go ahead and add a top of zero and also we're gonna add a box shadow so it floats right so it's gonna float from the top of the page so as soon as i add that now you can see that it has this nice little flow it's very subtle but it's a little flow and what we're gonna do now is for the left side we're going to basically go ahead and add the following we're going to say display flex on the header left which means that the logo should go in line with the uh search input field so let's go ahead and do that nice and then we are going to target the header input so we're going to go ahead and target that header input that we're sort of looking at and here i'm going to go ahead and do display flex align item center so save that and you can see what this does is it basically aligns that centrally on the vertical axis right so it's going to align it centrally on the vertical axis i'm going to then give that input a background color of uh it's like an off sort of gray that's the one that i have on the app i'm going to give a padding of 10 pixels and a margin left let's go ahead and do that nice and then i'm going to give a border radius of 999 pixels which gives you a perfect oval so you can go ahead and do that uh and at this point guys we should actually be good to move on to the next step so let's go ahead and make it 33 for now until it gets bigger otherwise it's good we're at one two three four likes let's go one thousand two hundred and thirty four likes that's amazing oh but i love that number that's so much we really appreciate that we're also at sixty dollar chat donation so we wouldn't be here with you guys really appreciate it smash the like button if you guys are enjoying this it's going to be exactly massively massive we appreciate you guys awesome so um with that we're basically going to go ahead and we've styled the input so we went ahead and added a bunch of styling to the input container um the header input so we're going to make that back to 999. save that again and here what we're going to do is go down and now so that's the header input container but you see the actual input inside if we go ahead and target the actual input so what we're talking about here is the actual input inside of header input we actually need to go ahead and target that and we're going to say border none so this will actually go ahead and get rid of this little border we're also going to say background color is transparent so this will mean it will blend in with the background and then outline width of zero we'll actually go ahead and get rid of this little blue sort of that we see right here we've got another lovely donation by shriver srivats star payatti he says can you please create react.js tutorial for beginners that's something which i'm actually i'm actually thinking of doing soon actually yeah that would be dope yeah i think on that yeah teaching you guys from completely scratch to taking you to building facebook and we're going to be doing that in the next weeks stay tuned guys yeah so keep tuned for that guys nice so oh damn kenny hey let's go dude i think i recognize this guy yeah yeah guys there is a way to selforganize my files into react component or pages and best practices maybe a course in the future live thanks a lot nice so kenny hank to answer your question uh to organize your files into your react components or pages that's actually firstly you answered your question right there so i would actually start by just organizing it into so i have a components folder and have a pages folder and then if you have a react router i would have some routing and depending on what pages you have have the pages in that photo and then all the reusable com components have inside of a components folder so start with that as for best practices there's so many things to cover here we try and cover a lot of best practice practices through our builds like the bem naming convention but i would highly recommend dude if you are interested in all of these things definitely go ahead and check out the course because i have live coaching calls every single tuesday where we do talk about all of the best practices every single thing that you could possibly ask you can ask inside of that um so honestly definitely make sure you check that out but thank you so much description below yep thank you so much man i appreciate you and then also supra dropped the 40 40 indian rupees donation thank you so much yeah he asks do we have any framework for easy css without code yes so there is actually tailwind css which is actually a big css framework out right now we're actually going to be dropping some content on that soon i haven't played with it too much but i know it's hot right now yeah so there's a lot of people doing that amazing i also know that if you're a designer you can use figma and i actually talked about that in my other video top seven tools that all developers should use so figma is amazing because if you're a designer you can just literally design drag and drop design there and then on the on the actual side it gives you the css and html codes so you can design something by drag and drop functionalities and then add them to your you know coding environment by getting the css portion of it that's really good point dude because uh i actually use that in a lot of professional environments where designer would give me the designs and the css is attached with things like figma so that's really really powerful yeah nice dope so we have styled the input so as soon as i save this notice how this is going to change right so we save it boom it gets rid of that that sort of uh stuff that problem that we had now right now obviously this is not ideal we don't want it to be this oval right here so what we need to do is we need to go down to the header center and we basically need to make that display flex because right now what it's doing is it's pulling this entire container down and we want everything here to be inside of a row as opposed to going up vertically so as soon as i save this we should see um we should see everything go into a row and let's double check why that hasn't happened let's go ahead and do headers oh this should be header center there we go header center and we save that guys and you'll see it all goes into a nice row there we go and then what we're going to do is we're going to say header option and here guys material ui gives um all of the all of its sort of icons this class right here by default so to target it we're saying inside of header option which is each one of these is inside its own header option container change the color to gray so as soon as i save that boom changes the color to gray and now we want it so that when we hover over those options so let's go ahead and add this in we hover over those options the icons will turn into the facebook blue so now you can see as i hover over it we get this nice blue effect so you see it changes into blue as seen there so that's a really nice little addon there then what we're going to do is for each of those header options i'm going to apply the following styles so i'm going to say display flex uh align item centrally padding of zero pixels uh on the top and bottom 30 on the left and right and change the cursor to a pointer so right now it's as you can see it's the normal mouse but we want to become that little finger so if we save it it should actually makes it into this very nice layout so we can see this right here and you can see at this point this changes to a sort of very nice layout at the top right now we also want to have some hover functionality for that middle so when we hover over it i want it to become very nice in terms of i want it to sort of show a kind of a background color difference a border radius around that align it essentially padding and border bomb so let's go ahead and do that and you can see now we get this lovely little effect right beautiful so now we're starting to see like like the the one that you were building back then exactly with the original build so it starts to come together quite nice um so let's make this a little bit bigger there we go and the next step guys is we're going to go ahead and target the header info so the header info is the text portion over here so header info when i say that i'm referring to literally just this portion so these two things are inside of header info so let's go ahead and do the following so we're going to say inside of header info display flex align item center which means that this will drop next to this as soon as i hit save and boom that's that's exactly what happened then we have a h4 tag so this one right here i'm going to space it a little bit by saying margin left so let's go ahead and do that we say margin left so it's not right next to it and then header right to get everything in these correct line we do display flex and boom look at that it just tied everything up together neatly and now we have hover functionality we have this search field over here and we also have this lovely sort of clickable elements over here which is awesome right so that looks very very clean uh and what i would say guys is as for the half screen size what we we're not going to be covering in this build but you could use media queries at this point to then further enhance this and show as it gets extremely smaller damn dude wow chris connor amazing thank you man thank you so much he's saying any recommendations for showing off ios slash android apps on web portfolio yes dude i actually have a really nice one so i would say is go ahead create yourself a portfolio you can build that in react and launch it on something like firebase go ahead and use your react skills to go ahead and learn react native and what i would say is build some maps with react native and you can actually go ahead and put those you could either launch them in the app store or you can possibly maybe i think there is a way i'm not entirely i can't remember off top of my but there's a way of actually showing like a demo or dude i would actually have a gif maybe of like showing your app on your web portfolio and you can actually have the source code to that app if you don't mind sharing it and yeah that's a really good way of doing it and that will actually give proof that you can actually use react native as well as react so you're not only a web developer but you're also now a mobile native app developer yeah yep yep guys don't forget always put your demo on your portfolio don't only put the picture of your build because once you start seeing the demo how it functions and everything it's just another level to your portfolio because i've seen so many portfolios with just the images it takes off so much takes away so much from the actual build that you made so you put in a lot of energy to that make sure that you show it on a demo exactly and i mean like whenever i see somebody's portfolio and it's just text and it's just images like you want to make sure you have it like a very juicy image and if you can maybe have an animated gif which shows quickly running through the app that's a lot nicer than sort of just doing it as opposed to just seeing some text so awesome thank you so much chris chris connor really really appreciate that donation nice so with that said now what we're going to do is we are going to go over and that's actually for this portion so what we saw is the um initial icon has a nice sort of uh you see this underline to it right so this is like an active state so what we do is in bem we can actually name it so we have this sort of active naming convention so whenever you have a it's called block element so this is the block the header component the element is option and then you can have something called a modifier so in this case we're going to add a class name to the first one we're going to call it header option dash dash active so this is basically saying this is the active button and what we can then do is go to our css and we can target it and we can say do the following we can say for the active container target the material ui icon change the color of that icon to blue and that's becomes active then we're also going to say target the actual container itself so the active container and give it a border bottom a four pixels solid and it's going to be the facebook blue and boom there you go you get that lovely little icon right there beautiful gives it a completely different experience yeah so that's awesome dude like that's looking really really clean we also need to go ahead and add something so like a little nice little placeholder at the top so it says search facebook right so i'm gonna go ahead and add that in now so that one's gonna say let's go ahead and do the following so we're going to say search where is it gone here placeholder and this one we just give it a string which we say search facebook awesome save that and there we go so somebody says why don't you guys use sass so honestly dude like my opinion against sas is things become super nested uh and what happens is when you get nested code it becomes just it just becomes ugly like in my opinion it becomes super ugly it becomes like very very hard to read that code and you want to stay away from stuff like that sas is a very very good library but it's misused that's the problem with the bam very simple and it's very easy to go ahead and use and it's also you don't have to set anything up with them it's just a convention that you follow it's very easy for everyone else to sort of follow that alongside all right so nice so with that said let's jump on and carry on so i love it man because honestly it's such a beginner you know problem when you're starting off you don't know what to name classes or components or anything and then you're just kind of doing it randomly and if you have something like bem you know the bam what is it called the bam um naming convention i guess naming convention yeah that really does help you it grounds you and lets you follow you know something structured so it gives structure to your code exactly it's going to give structure to your code it's going to look super clean guys um awesome so with that said let's go ahead and we added that active icon state so that's really nice and now you guys can see we've done that so what we're going to do now is go back to app.js so we're going to go back to our markdown so this is a good idea guys when you're sort of uh let me share the screen there we go so we're going to go back to our code and i'm going to get rid of this comment there we go nice so here this commenting actually helps us see um what we're gonna be building next so here i said app body so let's go ahead and create a div so everything under the header we consider as the body right so we're gonna say dev app body like so and then we're basically going to shift all of this stuff inside of the app body and the reason why is this will help us with styling later on so we have that now and then we need to build out these three things so let's go ahead and build them out so the first one is the sidebar so the sidebar as such and what we're going to do now is firstly go ahead pop open our file editor do sidebar.js use our very nice little trick called rfce so that's es7 snippets in the extensions and then here we're going to say class name equals sidebar and then we're going to import a sidebar.css like so boom and we have that there now what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and pop in the sidebar.css and that will actually allow us to sort of style this component in a very nice way so somebody asks why don't you use bootstrap with react guys what do you think sonny so bootstrap's very good if you're i would say if you're learning to use bootstrap it's very good for quick turnaround time so the reason being is oh we also got a juicy donation there i'll mention that in a sec so um bootstrap's very good if you have like a lot of clients and you just need to get work out uh it's very good but you have two problems with bootstrap in my opinion one i tend to wrestle with it when i'm using flexbox um and i just prefer to just use straight up flexbox i get the exact design i want as opposed to like near the design that i want so that's my first opinion and also the second thing is uh bootstrap kind of has a look to it like i i know when a website's built with bootstrap whereas if you built it with just pure flexbox it has like a custom clean finish to it so that's my personal take on it what's your idea on that frankie i honestly don't know much about bootstrap but i really like the minimalistic style of the material ui icons and then just you know being able to customize the css how you want it always gives it another another feel to your website i feel like it makes it more personalized so i really really dig that for sure definitely definitely and we got a juicy donation like you said from beatrice to sarah or tahereh and she drops five euros thank you so much she says hi guys amazing work could you guys tell me if this was possible to do with angular why should i choose react over angular all the success for you thank you so much betrays what's your take on this sonny so yes you can definitely build it in angular so these are all just sort of uh angular's a framework react is a library but you can build it definitely with my now react is much easier to learn it's much lighter weight so it's also very performant it's very fast your entry into getting into a react sort of career is much easier than an angular in my opinion also i would recommend it because the job market is higher right now in react the demand is higher in react and the overall average salary is higher in react so there's a lot of pros if you if you're looking into sort of separate yourself from the tech for a sec and look at the opportunities involved you have a lot of things going for you right now if you choose to dive into react yep and i feel like that should be one of your main you know driver for your decisions what's going out there in the world right now what do people need what technologies are used the most and also what's easy for you to implement and learn so take all of that into account and guys we're at 1373 comments wow we're about to reach 1500 sorry likes in this video that is insane guys thank you so much we're at eighty nine dollars in chat donations so amazing thank you guys for sticking on amazing guys and if you're enjoying the content literally just smash the thumbs up button help get this video out to as many people as possible share it if you're watching it right now tag me in frankie on our instagram handles and let's carry on killing these guys so what we're going to do now is we have the sidebar component so the sidebar component over here what we're going to do is so the sidebar just pretty much consists of a bunch of rows right so if we go ahead and open up our app so literally over here you can see it's just a bunch of rows so you can see we've got here a row here a row here or here another row they're just rows so we why don't we create a component that we can reuse uh and we're going to call this component the sidebar row because naturally that seems like a good name so let's go ahead and do sidebar row and we can pass in different props to this to make it to go ahead and customize it we just got a nice donation from tech aftab thank you dude appreciate that thank you so much man appreciate it awesome dude so the sidebar row yeah so we're going to go ahead and create that now so sidebar also to create we're going to go ahead and do the following we're going to say create a file sidebar row dot js boom do rfce for a little shortcut boom and you see these guys these little shortcuts save you a bunch of time guys like otherwise this would take ages to slowly write this out and do all these little things and then here i'm going to do import sidebar row.css and which means we have to create that file so let's go ahead and create that so this builds quite intense today guys we've got a lot of stuff going on um and we have so much content coming in this build so we have react context api we have authentication we have deployment oh it gets more and more exciting long list let's go yeah it's insane nice so we have the sidebar row here so let's go ahead and pull that in to our sidebar right so let's go here do the following auto import it from sidebar row save the file and we should see now if we go ahead into our sidebar and say i am a row so let's just make a p tag and let's just say row and what we can do now is if we repeat this a few times we should be able to see it should say and i think what's happening is it's actually maybe not showing it so we can see sidebar row sidebar let's go ahead so i think right now it's because this is because we actually oh okay yep we don't actually show the sidebar so we need to go ahead and auto import the sidebar save it and now it should show the site but there we go we've got the rose coming in beautiful yeah coming up clutch exactly guys coming in close guys you know like no matter how experienced you are with code sometimes you're just gonna forget to import a few things you know so always make sure to check that always always always so we're finished with the header now we're working on the side row and we also got another donation wow aurora thank you so much for the indian rupees appreciate you so much she says or he says do i need to make html css skills super for react so i'll let you in a little secret when i started learning react my css skills sucked dude wow i they my apps looked so ugly when i started learning react but i focused on learning react and that's what i'm going to tell you guys focus on learning react and sort of the fundamentals behind it that's going to be a lot more important and then guys follow these builds like honestly follow every single one of these builds watch how your css will naturally get better through pattern recognition right so you're just going to notice different things you're going to see oh i see that's how flexbox works and before you know it things will start to sort of stick and you'll start to get better at css yeah ultimately it's you know the when you implement those practices so you're working on react and you're trying to make you know maybe the text blue or you're trying to make a sidebar or something like that then that's how you're going to pick up css by actually implementing by actually putting in that knowledge to work other than that if you're trying to learn the language of css man you're going to get confused it's more about learning where it goes and how to apply it exactly at least exactly that 100 i couldn't agree more guys like exactly what frankie said and remember that pattern recognition is so powerful that's going to really be a game changer so with that said the sidebar row component so let's go to the sidebar row component so inside of sidebar inside of the sidebar row now sidebar row can take a bunch of props so this is how we receive props inside of react now props what are they we can pretty much pass in different attributes so here if i passed in a title which said something like let's just say this one could be for example pages so at the top over here we have something like this where it says pages oh we just got another donation thank you very much that's a south african rant by dash oh nice say sonny he says it's because of guys like you we developers grow big thanks i love that that's amazing that makes our hearts so warm thank you man so much we're trying to build 5000 developers trying to get them to get a job this year so you guys putting all of these projects in your portfolio applying to jobs are really helping us on that goal and we're here for you guys thank you yeah really really appreciate that dude and we love it like those comments just keep us going you know they keep the energy up they keep pushing us exactly love that so well here we have a title prop so here we would have pages friends messenger so yeah let's go ahead and implement that so just say something like pages um and then let's go ahead and pop in another one here so let's go like title equals uh friends so friends like such boom save it and now if we save this we should be able to see so the props instead of saying row what we could do is we could say props dot title and if we save that now over here we should actually see that we've got pages and friends so you see the ones where it's passed in it's rendering those and it shows that this has passed through as a prop what we can do to make this neater is we can destructure this so this is es6 and we can basically pull out the title at this point so we no longer need to say props we could just pull it out of here and say title and that will still work so you see everything still works and yeah so what we're going to do is we're also going to upgrade this component so it accepts a few more things uh and we're going to change it to include the following so the we're going to have a source an icon and a title and i'll explain what these do so source icon and title so here you can see that we use for the top component over here we have um so for this one we have essentially so this component here we have an avatar so for the source it's going to be the user's image right so we can either pass that in or we can pass in an icon so if you pass in an icon it will come through like this so we're going to make our component extremely reasonable we also got another donation from enough aurora dude it's amazing like this kind of reading them i know it's like the third time he dropped something on this yeah on this specific live stream that's insane thank you so much manov we're also at 96 dollars in donations guys hey let's go guys 100 mark that's going to be our 11th time or 12th time actually breaking the 100 mark if you guys help us out with that wow we just got another donation another one hey caledon would say says gorov gorov says how to shift from angular to react love you guys my honest opinion dude is just start if you've done angular honestly when you start you'll be you'll be so amazed because you'll be like oh my god i didn't realize because angela has such a steep learning curve it's a framework so you have to do every single thing as they tell you to do it whereas react you only use things as you need it so as you need things you then you use it right so it's a lot easier to get into it my honest opinion follow these live streams literally you can go through every single live stream and you'll just get better and better and better and you'll pick up react by doing these live streams one hundred percent damn another donation frankie go ahead and drop down oh deepak you helped us pass the one hundred dollar mark on hey so much let's go he says appreciate your work are you planning to do more projects than node.js in the future yes my man we definitely are so thank you so much for your donation just stay tuned stay tuned give us some time you know we gotta sleep we gotta plan we gotta eat all of that we're humans too but we're here for you guys and gonna provide you with that much more value actually got some exciting news for you guys so a lot of you guys have been asking about the man stack so you want the man stack you're like yo sometimes you drop a video on monster carsey frankie let us know about mersack so we listened to you guys we stayed up last night and we've done an immense amount of planning and we have three banger videos for you guys next week scheduled scheduled exactly and we are building the tick tock clone the tinder clone and the whatsapp clone all using the man stack so if you guys are excited drop some fire in the comments and smash the thumbs up button because we have that coming for you guys drop some freaking fire in the comments guys we're at 148 likes we need 12 more likes to reach the 1.5 k mark thank you guys so much everybody's asking about mern mern is so hot right now a lot of companies are looking for mern stack developers and we're going to teach you just that thanks to sunny and thanks to also david who's going to be helping you with those builds exactly you guys are going to meet david he's an amazing developer on pwj and he's going to be doing those builds with me so that'll be awesome and also thank you to vinot vino for another super chat let's go dude it's funny because david was a pwj student so he was a prophet with javascript student he was a watcher just like you guys he decided to join the program now his skills are to a great great level he's a he's an awesome developer and now he's going to be working hand in hand with sunny so he was from our community and now he's going to be bringing value to you guys as well exactly and guys i have had the privilege to see like a lot of these guys go from absolute like in their beginner stages just to like frankie so how quickly have these guys turned into the developers like that they're doing stuff it's insane in a few months probably like three two months yeah something like that and now they're building crazy apps they're doing all this stuff like literally we jump on things it's insane like and you guys can be a part of that community as well so that's profit with javascript link is in the description and if you're on the fence with that free training guys there's a free training in the description so just sign up to that while you wait look at all that fire in the chats that's amazing and yeah for any of you that don't know shubham dropped it in the comments mirn is [ __ ] express react and node all put together into one text tag so we're going to be teaching all of that to you exactly so there's going to be some intense videos so make sure you get your sleep for those videos because it's going to be some exciting week next week that's awesome let's jump back into the build so we were working on the sidebar row so the sidebar row over here so let's go ahead and pull this out right now so the sidebar row let's go ahead and check this out so sidebarrow we have a few things that we want to pop in here so we want to say if there is a source so if we pass in the source prop then we're going to render out an avatar with the source being used as the source that we pop in uh so we need to go ahead and import the avatars which is this import statement over here and then we're going to say if you pass in an icon then we're going to then only then are we going to render out the icon right and this icon right here is not imported it's actually passed through as a prop right so whenever you pass a component as a prop so if many of you might have not realized that you could do that you can actually pass a component as a prop but you have to use a capital letter otherwise it won't work if i change this to a lowercase i it will actually break so if i go ahead and do this it doesn't work you see it changes the color and that actually breaks everything from working so it's a convention inside of reactor capital i which is why also all of our file names are using their components have capital letters so something to to know if you didn't know that so yash kendall says are using redux for this we're using the react context api and we're going to be using that in today's build so keep tuning stay tuned and smash the thumbs up if you're excited for that so so now what we're going to do is we have a rather than a p tag i'm going to use a h4 wait hold on whoa 1550 likes on this video insane guys oh my god thank you so much cp family clever programmer family damn you guys surprised us every freaking live stream thank you so much and it's just growing seriously dude like it's actually insane down nice so let's go ahead and we've got these three things in here right now so these three different things so what we're gonna do is we're gonna actually go ahead and pass in a bunch of props so we actually have some they data available for us so let's go ahead and do that so let's go to our sidebar over here and let's go ahead and pass in some dummy props so here we have a bunch of icons being passed in so we need to import those so let's go ahead and do that let's import those at the top and then you can see here so this one right here we actually don't have a source so we don't have this yet and we don't have the user's display name yet so at this point i'm just going to say the user is sonny sanger and the source let's go ahead and i've actually got a image on google so let's go ahead and do sony saying uh i'm going to grab this image quickly so we can just see boom we can copy the image address and then i'll come back to the app there we go and here we can do this so that's just an image right there and what this will do guys is it says expand more outline is not defined so we need to go ahead and import that as well boom like so and what this will do now is it should pop out those sidebar components onto the page so if we save this we refresh we should see those components pop in um there's a little bit of a delay there but it should pop in any second so once that's done what we're going to do is we're going to actually go to our sidebar row and we're going to start styling this thing so let's go to our sidebar row.css and let's go ahead and see first you'll see why that's not actually working maybe it's compiling there we go it's compiling sometimes it gets held up it's completely fine if it does that just carry on developing um and you can come back to it when it works so we go to our sidebar row.css and here what i'm going to do is i'm going to say displayflex so what you can do when this happens guys you can press con control c npm start so that will cancel that and it will rerun it again right so i'll rerun it again and that should kickstart it again so that sometimes helps if it gets stuck beautiful what is that shortcut that you use to you know go to choose you know like sidebar row css and all of that to search on it good shot that's command p so command p pops open this such and if you do command p command p again you see you can go back to your previous file which is really handy and if you keep tapping it you can go down a file which is awesome and then you can actually type in there so if i want the sidebar row then i can just go down and hit enter so that's how i navigate really quick beautiful yeah that's really really cool um so i'm not sure why this is okay there we go we're back people are saying some path is saying next mark zuckerberg is sunny hey not too far off nice dude yeah hopefully i mean we'll see hopefully we get that zuckerberg paycheck yeah let's go nice so now guys you see it looks like this which is not exactly how we want the app to look right so what we're going to do is we're going to target the sidebar row and we're basically going to go ahead and add the following display flex align item center padding at 10 pixels and change it to a cursor pointer so the minute we do that you see everything goes into a nice little view there and we pretty much get this pointer uh cursor which looks a lot cleaner all right then what we're going to do is we want so when we hover over it the background color is going to go light gray and a border radius of 10 pixels is applied so if we do that now you can see we get that border radius you can see it's a very subtle border radius at the end and you get that hovering over effect the next thing we're going to do is target that h4 which is the text inside we're going to say margin left of 20 pixels so now it no longer pushes next to it i'm going to say a font weight of 600 so it changes the boldness of that and then we are going to change the color of the icons and the size of the icon so to do that we're going to go inside the sidebar we'll say the direct child remember this is what the icons get given as a class name by default we're going to change the font size to extra extra large and we're going to color the facebook blue and with that look at that looks really really slick and we've got a nice looking um we've got a nice looking sidebar component so responsive i love it yeah it's really really clean right um i just want to address this one as well so uh nitin thank you so much he says sunny is react probably makes things look so easy honestly dude i really appreciate that but trust me there was a point in time where like i was also in a i was also a beginner and i was learning and i was very you know like very sort of stuck and things like that and also somebody else just said no bugs in your builds as good uh as a good as a developer it feels so good oh awesome so he's i think he means when he's following along but guys i'll tell you when i'm actually prepping the build i do run into a gazillion bugs so like if you run into bugs as well it's completely normal obviously we do prepare in advance so the live streams can be super super uh seamless but it's a normal thing to get stuck right it's another thing to get stuck just don't quit do not quit isn't that right frankie like that persistence yeah it's the best way to learn man from your mistakes from other people's mistakes like i mentioned on the last live stream it is true bugs are gonna bugs are gonna be your greatest teachers probably most likely and yeah i love seeing faces familiar faces like the greatest ever thank you man for being here i love it you're always on the live streams man bringing in the positivity that's really what we want from you guys and we're going to teach you all that we know thank you so much exactly thank you so much guys awesome so let's go and continue on so we have the sidebar row completed now the sidebar itself is actually complete which means that we can go ahead back to app.js and we can get rid of our little annotation nice so what we're going to do now is we're actually going to go ahead and add in the feed right so the feed now the feed is the juicy part it's pretty much where we have all of so everything inside of the center of the page is the feed so uh every oops everything inside of the center of the page so everything you see here is the feed so this middle component is the feed and that's where we're going to pretty much have all of this component sitting right now right so and you can also see oh damn it's got me and frankie come up in the uh the little widget that we built somebody asked somebody asked if if it gates if that specific sidebar gets updated what are we calling that right sidebar sony uh yeah so this is the widgets yeah the right type yeah exactly so yep sunny says that we use iframes for that right sony yeah so this is actually an iframe and it's pulling the information uh live from facebook so that's actually working dynamically yeah yep that's the real clever programmer website that's where it's getting that information that's awesome man exactly yeah really really cool nice so now what we're going to do is we're going to actually go ahead and make this perfect size there we go and we are going to go ahead and build out the feed component so let's go ahead and do that so what we need to do is create the feed.js so feed.js do rfce save like that class name of feed so let's go ahead and do class name of feed and let's go ahead and import so to import feed.css like such right so that's awesome and then we also need to create the feed.css file oopsfeed.css like so and now we have the import at the top and we can pretty much start building out the feed so the feed let's go ahead and check out so the feed what we have here is we have a few things right so let's go ahead and do our tactic that we like doing uh where we pretty much mask things out right so in this middle section we have this beautiful story real like this this story rail that we see at the top right so this story rail right here pretty much is what we're gonna write here so that's going to be its own component so this one is going to be called the story real right and the next component underneath that is going to be what we call the message sender component right and thank you saeed imran for another super chat awesome dude and oh wow oh nice check this out again wow thank you so much man he says this is for frankie to capture senior deb chair hey let's go man this chair is awesome i'm still getting used to it i don't know about this pillow but it's it's pretty good man at least um i get my back straight so do you guys so much it's like you guys got paired up and dropping the donation at the same time we love that thank you yeah yeah exactly i love it's weird how that happens right like everyone everyone always doubles yeah yeah it's insane all right so then we're gonna have the message sender component so the message sender component i'm referring to this so that's we're gonna call that the message sender um yeah so let's go ahead and build out the so firstly it's complaining now because it's saying feed is not defined so let's go back into oh i just don't want to save that one let's go back into app.js and let's go ahead and import this so import feed from feed so there we go uh back into feed save this file and this hide so we clean things up so here we're going to basically have a story real component so this is going to be something like this it's going to say story real like so and we save it and now it's going to freak out because it's like oh well we don't have a story real component so storyrod.js we need to create once we go in here rfce do it like this and then we're going to go ahead and create a class name so a class name of story real remember naming convention camel casing right here and then we're going to do import story rail so story real like so dot css save it create the css file so story real.css boom we have it and then we're back so now we have this stuff ready to go so the story rail pretty much consists of you can imagine right so where we have that story real we have several oops i always do that by mistake we have several uh stories inside of it so you guessed it these are also components these are going to be story components and we're just gonna pass in props and we're gonna render it out differently based on which prop we pass in so you see like this is the beauty behind react guys like it's it's why react is so powerful it's why i love react it's why like i just just don't waste your time letting anything else just spend it you learning reacting it's just so powerful how we're going to do this so the goal here is to have essentially a few different stories like so um syed imran just dropped another donation nice dude wow i've just learned html csc i mean i think he means css js what's next react is next bro go ahead and follow these tutorials man i think that's the next step for you for sure yeah 100 reacted react nice and thank you for the donation again thank you bro all right so we're going to have this story component several times and we're going to pass in different props right so now what i'm going to do is create a story.js so story.js rfce and boom we get that and here i'm going to say class name of story so like so and at the top we're going to say import story.css story.css which means you guessed it we have to create the story.css file right so you see once you get faster doing that it becomes very quick to do that step right and that's going to be something which you do want to get speed up use things like snippets to make it faster those tasks we don't want to spend too much time on when to spend time on the juicy stuff right so let's go into the story now the story is going to have the props passed in at this point here right now we're going to destructure this prop these props at this point and we're going to pull a few things right so we're going to pull we have an image here so we have the actual image so you see the background image that's going to be an image so we're going to have that so we're going to say image then we actually go ahead and we have a two things we have this uh sort of profile picture so this one right here right this profile picture right here we're going to have and then we also have some text right so you see where it says sunny sang you see where it says rafikaze where it says frankie aaron bernard and nars um so we're pretty much going to pass that in as another thing here so for the profile picture we're going to call it profile source right so i mean don't hate me the name was in a rush but we're going to call it proposals and then this one is title uh and another beautiful donation from aditya pawa awesome again wow that's really seems like it's the same people dropping donations thank you guys so much man i really really mad it feels so great to see familiar faces dropping in donations multiple times it just shows us how grateful you guys are and really we're so grateful for being able to share this with you guys as well thank you so much yeah honestly definitely like it's huge guys uh i just wanted to ask frankie where are we at with the the donations right now so chat donations right now we're at 106 thank you so much damn and guess what our likes are at 1 659 so smash that like button let's get to 1 700. this is one of our most liked builds as far damn that's love that dude love that let's keep this energy going guys so we have the story which takes three props it has image it has profile source and title so we're gonna have a few things inside of here right we're gonna have an avatar and the avatar is gonna be the avatar that you see on the right and that's going to take you guessed it here's the source but we're going to use the profile source as the input for that avatar so that should actually go ahead and pop in the person's picture so there we go and then we're going to have a h4 which is going to have the title that we pass in right now for the background image so for this background image what we're going to do is and also to make this very easy to understand and see what we're going to do is where we have the story real let's go ahead and actually just render out a few of these components so let's go ahead and go back to our story realm and now what i've done here guys i've saved you a bunch of hassle and i've gone ahead and i've just created a few component calls here with the correct props so i'm going to quickly make this full screen for a second so you guys can go ahead and pause the video and look at these so you guys can see that we also need to import the story there we go and i'm going to go ahead and pop that back to the side and basically these are some dummy props i've gone ahead and and sort of put out to save you a bit of time now we have that let's go back into uh it says inside of feed the story row is not defined so we need to import that boom save it and then it should start working again there we go so now the story we can see okay nice we can see each of the different uh each of us we've got sunny me frankie obviously we've got me quasi frankie aaron and nars right now for the background of the div i actually want to set that as the image that we pass in right so i want to actually i actually want to make that uh the image that we passed in yeah i know i just read that yeah me too i saw frank saying don't scroll down i think we made non nonsuitable for workbook by mistake damn it guys keep it clean we don't want to bring it bring that website down because of you guys everybody wants to learn we want to see it you know function so keep it clean guys exactly keep that clean guys um so at the div at this point so for the div what we're going to do is we are going to go inside and it's it's also funny that sunny for my picture he put jeff bezos because i'm freaking bald as well he said he couldn't look at my he couldn't find my picture i was like yeah i'm probably rich you know i didn't even realize until uh sheila pointed it out that he was both because i didn't actually pick it because he was well i was like yo here's a badass like that because i couldn't find a picture of frankie and i just thought about that jeff bezos is a badass then i realized subconscious yeah oh man so now guys we're going to use something called an inline style so you can start with css but you can also style inline and here what you do is you pass in an object in your jsx like this and you would do background image so it's not usually we're used to something like this but in when you do it this way you do it in a camel casing fashion and here we're going to use backticks i'm going to say go to a url and that url is going to be the image that we pass in right so with that said now this should actually set the background image of this div so each of these divs to the image that we passed in so if i save that now we should see we should see the background images you see that nice we actually get the background images uh pop in so we're gonna make this look like what we see in the react app so this right we're gonna make it even with the hover functionality so you're gonna see how we can go from that to that which is just some css changes so hopping into the story.css the first thing we're going to do is also for this avatar what we're going to do is we're going to give it a class name of story under squad underscore avatar to make it easier to target that yes we can target the uh class that material ui gives it but it's kind of easier to do it this way so we're going to go ahead and save and then we're going to go inside inside of story.css like so inside of here now what we're going to do inside of here is we're going to go and do the following so this is a few rules so get ready for this one guys so the first one is we're going to say target the story containers the outer container and we're first going to do position relative so that way when we do absolute positioning with the child components they're going to be relative to this parent so that's something which is very important and you should check it out a few people are saying styled components yes we will actually be using style components in some future builds because i love style components as well and i do use them in some of my builds so the first thing we're going to do is background position center center background size cover background repeat no repeat so what this will do is it should center the images now you see some of them are being repeated now so if i save this we should go ahead and see that it doesn't happen anymore it doesn't repeat it just kind of it still looks weird but we're going to go ahead and fix that with a width and a height so let's go ahead and drop in a width and a height of 120 pixels 200 uh height there we go so now you can see that sort of card dimension coming into play then what we're going to do is we're going to add a box shadow so box shadow will give it that nice 3d effect so let's go ahead and add that in and now you can see guys i'm seeing that there's a little bit of flashes on sonny's screen right now am i the only one looking at that or can you guys see it also just just so we know thank you just drop it in the comments below if you guys are experiencing that it's not something too overwhelming but i just figured it out let me know oh yeah i can see that actually uh maybe let me go ahead and go back to the screen so let's see if that works so maybe that's better yeah nice but if that does happen guys i would apologize for that i'm not sure why that's happening um we'll try to we'll try our best to fix it for sure and guys we just crap we just crossed 1 700 likes on this video let's go there's so many people hey some people are saying i see the flashing too we can see it we can see it awesome yeah we'll try to get that fixed for you guys we just got another discount dude another sorry a donation it says is there any student discount for profit with javascript course how old is the content of the course so thank you an answer yep so discounts for students no man right now we don't and that's really for a reason too man it's it's it is an investment it will be an investment on your part because you're investing in yourself and ultimately you know that's the best thing that you can do if you're starting off with your career and really with your life it is really a shortcut so it's going to be very worth it man the old the age of the course is very very recent we started developing it in late december 2019 to this point we're still putting in new modules so nas just finished uh what was it a google chrome extension i think like last week so he's about to shoot that so it's still in development just because new technologies are arising and everything it is very very relevant and it's top of the line so it is completely worth it thank you so much for your donation man yeah exactly and guys what i will say is the price right now is actually discounted for everyone so the price you're seeing right now is going to be only a limited price very soon we're going to have a challenge we're going to be doing a react challenge and once we do that challenge guys the price goes up and it stays up so once that price goes up guys it does not come back down again all right so we like if you if what i would say is go ahead and check out that price right now and make sure if you're on the fence just remember that it will go up in in maybe in like three weeks time two weeks time so don't miss out because once it goes back uh up you're not going to get it back at the price you're seeing it at now yeah man you don't want it to go up if you don't have the money right now tell your mom tell your friends tell your father tell everybody anybody you know that can help you with your development that's going to completely you know help your life it's going to be completely worth it for you and actually frank says sonny's crushing it crushing the code too hard the monitor can't keep up hey anymore so i think we got rid of that yeah see it's funny because when i stop coding it's like whoa we can breathe nice so there we go so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and do this so border radius of 10 pixels margin right 10 pixels and this right here so this will actually change it to a pointer cursor so we get that and then this will actually prepare it so that we get that nice animation in a second so to get that animation what we do is we add the following we say story hover like so right we do this now what this does guys is can you see it actually hovers as i hover over it grows and this is scaling to seven percent bigger so this is one and seven percent so it's like seven percent scale so that's what we do when we do this now the transition here is saying make that transform last 100 milliseconds and ease in the transition so here you can see that we get a very nice ease in transition effect so that's going to be another donation dude and amazing dude we're at 114 in chat donations right now thank you so much carlos he says your streams make me not get afraid to clone big websites muchas gracias thank you so much man we really appreciate that 50 mexican pesos thank you that's dope dude yo like that man spanish is so sick i think it's the coolest language it just sounds cool he said yeah i love it it's kind of it's kind of a sexy language and also if you know spanish you can also learn portuguese really easily a little bit of french italian too so all of those romance languages thank you thank you that's nice dude right the next thing we're going to do is target the avatar right so that little avatar that we see we're going to do margin 10 pixels and we're going to do a border around it which is like the little blue border and then the final thing to style here is that h4 tag inside of it right so we're going to go ahead and make it absolute positioning but because we set the parent to relative it's going to be absolute within the parent container so we're going to say bottom and left of 20 pixels and then the color will be white so now you can see we've got this nice effect right we've got this nice finished little effect and you can see guys this is actually looking a lot like the actual app it's just the layout it's different yeah it looks beautiful it looked it looked super big once you when you implemented it at first but now that you fix this it looks just like the facebook app it's amazing and also pranav left another donation of 40 indian rupees thank you so much man he says waiting for mern whatsapp clone keep it up thank you man yeah stay tuned for that sonny and david are going to kill it next week with those builds and yeah you're going to learn a lot from it the mern stack the most right now demanded stack for us so exactly thank you awesome that is all coming next week so exciting stuff for you guys so with that said we have the story pretty much done so now we're gonna go into our story reel and we're gonna go ahead and style this so it looks the way we want it to look so what we're going to do here is we're going to go over to our story real.css and all we need to do here is very simple actually guys we just need to do a story roll um over here we need to do story real and what we do is display flex right so as soon as i hit save on that boom it goes into a row so you see that we get a nice little row going on right and then what we want to do is we're going to go ahead and do the following so each of these should also have a little margin next to them so we're going to go ahead and say each of the stories should have a little margin next to them actually we got rid of that sorry we don't need to we just need to say display flex there we go happy days nice so with that said now we have the sidebar and we have this right here now obviously this doesn't look this doesn't look right because everything's sort of like positioned incorrectly so let's go back to our app.css and we're going to make some tweaks over here so that we get the positioning correct as we want it so if we go back to app.js we notice that everything is inside of app body we have the sidebar the feed and the widgets so everything that you see here in terms of the fill full build you have these three sections you have the um oops not that one sorry we have this over here so we have the um the sidebar the feed and these widgets right so these are very very important to take note of right now so we have those things inside here and what we're going to do is we're going to style it so they actually sit next to each other so right now they're obviously stacking on top of each other because inside of our body by default it's uh by default it's um it's display block okay now let's go ahead and go to app.css and let's go ahead and do the following we're going to say app body app body and we're going to say display flex right so display flex like this save it boom and you should be able to see now that boom it goes next to it right so we actually get that nice behavior right there so it goes very nicely like that we're also going to make the background of the app turn to the gray that facebook has so if we do that and then the header had a background of white so you should actually stick out so now you can see however big the app is it will show us the background of it and what we could do for now just to make sure that we can see the entire app covered is we can say a height of 100 view height and we can get rid of this afterwards so there we go so you can see we've got that looking pretty sweet now what we're going to do to continue on with that is we're going to make this a little bit bigger so we can see it the entire thing there we go we're going to go ahead and jump into so that's that component done for now which is clean what we're going to now do is actually have it so that let's go ahead and check something quickly so where did we render these story rows inside of feed so in feed and what we're going to do guys is feed let's go ahead and start feed a little bit as well because feed we should actually have some padding and stuff like that because right now it's kind of scrunched up to the top right so the feed i want it to have precedence i want to say flex 1 so it should try and take up as much room as it possibly can i'm then going to add some padding i'm going to say 30 pixels on the top and bottom 150 on the left and right then we'll say display flex so anything any child inside of it should now go into a column flex direction and then we're going to say justify content seller align items center so as soon as we save that not this page sorry oops now we should actually see that it spaces things out a little bit so that's a lot cleaner and it looks a lot better in that sense so we actually get this at the moment um and it looks a bit strange for now because i think we haven't done the sidebar all right so i need to go ahead and also start the sidebar and for the sidebar i'm just going to do a flex of 0.33 and i'm going to say padding of 25 pixels and this right here 10 pixels all right so right now it's aligning center because it only has this one child but once we put more children in it it will align it centrally like such right so that's why we see it like this but for now it's actually looking pretty clean like it's doing pretty good right so amazing yeah yeah so everything's looking pretty clean and now what we're going to do guys is we are going to go to the i'm going to get rid of this comment so the comments actually help you figure out and actually help me even figure out what we're doing next so message sender is next so what we're going to do is inside a feed let's go ahead and check out so message sender refers to this right here guys so this part right here so this component right here oops that was horrible talk about this one here yeah so this right here is the message sender component and this is going to be responsible for how you essentially push some messages out onto the platform so let's go ahead and do message pretty much make posts huh yeah exactly here's how you're gonna post things so let's go ahead and create that file so message sender message oops message sender.js boom rfce go ahead and do this rfce like so let's go ahead and do oops div give it a class name of message sender so message sender like that let's go ahead and do import message sender.css like so and now inside of here what we're going to do is we are going to have a few things so this one actually is broken down quite into a sort of complicated sort of more complicated structure so here we have a few things that we need to take note of right we have the let's go ahead and make this smaller so we have a few things we have the header top so this is the header top and then we have the header bottom and then inside of here we have a few things that we're going to do with containers that allow us to achieve this design right so what we're going to do is we're going to draft it out here so we're going to create a div and this the first div is going to be message sender underscore top so it's going to be the top section and then the next one is going to be message sender dot bottom so message sender bottom so it's gonna be the bottom stuff over there now inside the top we're gonna have a few things we're gonna first have an avatar so it's gonna have an avatar so this is gonna refer to the avatar that you see on the right right so this is actually gonna refer to this avatar right here so this one right here and then we're going to be able to call that same avatar from the beginning right when you put it in the header to begin with yes so that avatar is the same component right now we're not actually passing in and we got somebody here guys who is this guy oh oh my god fresh bro look at that looking fresh nice bro you want to take over i don't have to take whatever you guys can keep new a special guest here cazzy looking clean looking 10 years younger nice rough good boy looking fresh yeah yeah he's saying he's not the only one with a clean cut today oh yeah let's go nice bro let's go i'll be here tomorrow you know yep so kazzy's gonna be here tomorrow for tomorrow's live stream and that's gonna be what builds sunny uh i am not wait tomorrow they're not doing anything i think tomorrow's you bro oh yeah actually so stay tuned guys i was trying to you know push him to go live tomorrow because you guys are missing him so much but yeah you'll have me don't worry about that nice dope dude you'll be sitting with me yeah you were working with the avatar honestly yeah so we're working with the avatar component so we had over here the avatar component and that is let's go ahead oh i didn't actually make you guys full screen there we go guys how you know you can see kazi then nice so let's go ahead and carry on so we had the uh message sender component so we've split that up into message top message bottom now for the this section right here so we're going to actually assume that this whole thing by the way like we have hit over 114 dollars in revenue that is insane yeah 23 000 views so thank you guys so much for that that is absolutely epic frank says how's it looking nice sharing appreciate it insane dude insane so much nice so here guys this is we're gonna actually wrap inside of a form so over here we're gonna say form and this form we don't have an action here so it's just a form and here we have two input fields so i'm gonna say input one like so and input two right and the first one is going to be the so it's gonna have a placeholder of just which says what's on your mind right so the first one's gonna say what's on your mind so it's gonna have a placeholder and that's what they say on the actual facebook one so it says what's on your mind boom like so save it and there we go let's go ahead and import the avatar as well so we've got that at the top and then the bottom ones we can go ahead and remove this input type because by default it is typed text so we can go ahead and get rid of that and now here guys we're going to go ahead and give this one a class name as well so the first one we're going to go ahead and say this has a class name of message sender input the second one we're going to give it a placeholder which says image url which is optional so this one's going to be for the image url and the first one is going to be for the actual message that you're sending right so once we have that in place we're then going to have a hidden button right so this is actually i'll explain why we have this afterwards but this hidden button is crucial now we're going to this is going to fire off a handle submit function so i'm going to say const handle submit takes an event and so anytime you have some kind of on click it actually gives you something called an event so here it's going to be e and we don't want it to refresh when we submit so we're going to say e dot prevent default like that and this will actually trigger this function when we click and also guys by making it type submit it means that when we're inside of this function so if i type something and i hit enter it actually submits the form right so it actually submits the form and that triggers this function right here so how so if you literally with the on click event when you submit it's going to show it right there because of the line that you just added right the e dot prevent default so if you couldn't add that line then it would refresh or how would that work so yes if i actually got rid of this sign for a sec so let's go ahead and do this and let's go back to our one so it says message for sender not just go to feed oh oops feed let's go ahead and fix this import message sender we need to import that into our app so let's go save it and if we refresh we should see now that we have a very ugly looking input and it says cannot resolve message sender.css i need to create that file i forgot to do that messages.css boom and now this will actually should pull it in so we should see the file come in there we go so we've got the avatar and what's on your mind so now if i type in here type in here and i hit enter it refreshes you see that so you see at the top isn't here i see the it refreshes now we don't want that and we actually hate refreshing so we by putting e dot prevent default it's preventing the default behavior so now when we do it we should notice that if i type i type and i hit enter i don't even have to go to that button if i just type enter now it's not actually going to do it so it stops that default behavior from happening right beautiful so the next section is the bottom message center bottoms uh part right so here we're gonna have a few things we're gonna have three options right and each of these options are gonna refer to this live video photo video and feeling an activity so we're gonna go ahead and create that we're gonna say dev dot message sender message sender option like this right it's gonna be the first one guys we just crossed one thousand eight hundred likes on this video let's go okay likes that's insane 1 800 likes wow that's 1800 people clicking the button until it turns blue that's insane hopefully we can reach the 2k mark but thank you guys so much yeah that's insane dude like if i think we will break 2k i think you guys can help us do that if you're enjoying the video all we ask is that you smash that thumbs up button and share with others as well so we can all exactly share with others tag us in your instagram stories our links are right here dope nice with that said guys we are gonna inside of the option so the first option is gonna consist of a video camera icon so it's the video camera icon is this one right here material ui and a h3 tag which says live video so let's go ahead and import the video camera icon uh i'm going to actually import all three so we have three icons up here i'm going to go ahead and drop them in here so video cam icon photo library icon and the insert emoticon icon so we have the first one here and this one is actually going to go ahead and pop in the following for us you see we get the icon and we get live video now that's going to give us that the second one is going to be the photo and video and notice guys so i'm actually also passing in an inline style which changes the color of the icon to red and this one the color of the icon to green so i like to mix it up no i don't always like to use direct css i'd like to show you guys a mix of inline styling as well so that way you guys can learn that in case you didn't know how to do that the next one is the photo and video one as well and then we're going to have the last one which is feeling an activity just go ahead and drop that in over here so save and we still have we still also have over half a thousand people watching this video guys so live right now it's just mind mindblowing like to think that there's that many people right now that's like a little stadium of people like insane literally imagine all of those people in a room that would be insane like it's insane right is it proper crazy to really look into live events that's crazy and yeah these icons like the live icon then the photo icon and the smiley face icon are all those material ui icons or what yeah they are material ui icons because yeah they really look they look very legit does facebook use the exact same ones because yeah so so they don't use the exact but they're very similar and a lot of them are actually a lot of them are actually the exact ones yeah all right so it's really really good um nice so dj frankie from kenya says you guys are amazing picking lots of tricks up from the stream awesome dude very very glad that you're getting value from this keep stay tuned guys because we get very very juicy soon so we're going to have the realtime database implementation we're going to have react context api we are going to have a firebase deployment there's so much stuff coming out certification as well yeah and user authentication so like how we're going to get through this like stay tuned and you'll figure it out right so let's carry on going so we've got message sender so message sender dot css now what i'm going to do here is go to our message center dot css and the first thing i'm going to do is apply the following styles so i'm going to say to the overall container i'm going to do display flex margin top 30. effects direction should be column so all of the children get stacked up i'm going to give it a background color of white border radius of 15 so you get this nice rounded effect box shadow which gives it this floating card effect and a width of 100 so it takes up the full width of the screen uh or full width of its parent container the next thing we're going to do is that top section right so we're going to go ahead and start start that top section we're going to say display flex which pushes the avatar in line with the rest of them we're then going to do border bottom one pixel solid so that gives it this little break uh here padding bottom gives it a little bit of spacing at the bottom and the padding around it 15 pixels awesome so we can actually go ahead and get rid of this one if we do that nice so with that said we can then go ahead and target that form so i want that form to actually go ahead and take up all of the room it possibly can and i want it to then be display flex as well so that will help us with the next part which is actually going inside the form and targeting the input container so we go inside the form and we target the input container and here we say outline width of zero and what this does guys is you see this little blue outline it goes ahead and gets rid of that right so it goes ahead and gets rid of that and then we're going to say border none so it should get rid of that and we're going to say padding 5 pixels margin zero left and right um i think it's zero top and bottom ten left and right border radius rounded so it's like a perfect oval and then a background color so if we go ahead and do that we get boom we get these nice little you see that it's very very clean very very nice um and also i want to add this this is bugging me it says what's on your mind question mark it's a little subtle things guys so that really drives me crazy for us says for us khan got landed randomly on your live it's amazing i always wanted that type of content you guys rock wow man it's it's insane thank you so much for us you know it's this type of content is i love it because i feel like it's very easy to digest even when sunny is going through tutorials that might seem so complicated for many people we try to make it the most easiest for you guys to engage and actually you know finish out the whole build which is really the end point that we want to get you guys to exactly exactly and we're just really glad that you guys are enjoying it because we'll keep it coming we'll definitely keep it coming guys if you're enjoying this nice so we added that net that portion this which is the input right so the next thing that we are going to do is actually go ahead and add in the following we're going to say target the button inside of that form and do display none so you see the hidden submit we don't actually want to show that submit button so it's very simple and there's a reason being because you just wanna it's a very intuitive experience right when you go here and you say what's on your mind and you just type in like hey uh i'm good or something or like hey uh i'm pumped or something like that it pumped and you hit enter you just want it to work we don't want to go to a button click here you just want to have some natural behavior hey what's in your mind um hitting the gym or something like that right here in the gym and you just say enter boom sends it off right we don't actually want that little button so what we do is we hide the button but it keeps the functionality and acts as a submit so when you hit enter key it actually triggers the button and then what we're going to do is change the whole experience of everything because yeah man you don't want to be hitting submit every time it's like you want to do you know everybody cares about their time it's the most valuable assets that we have and if really your design is made in a way so that you can you know share that with others and actually make it so that it's it's important for your design and your users then that's going to take your whole build the next level so that's great nice and dude i love this comment so jurgen hector actually said though i only know javascript fundamentals and i haven't started any type of react.js this tutorial isn't very complicated to understand that's what we're going for like that's exactly what we're going for that exact sort of thing right um what i always say to people so i always get a question of when should i learn react or when should i start my journey with react just start as soon as possible because like like jordan said yeah just start right now and just literally start by following along with the tutorials follow along with the builds and guys before you know it these things come like everything will come to you in the natural place right so very very important stuff we're at 1878 likes let's go what is it 22 more likes to get to 1 900 likes guys help us out with a thumbs up if you guys are still here for those of you who are just jumping in right now we're building facebook literally building facebook so you guys can see so like that video let's get to 1 900 guys thank you so much exactly nice awesome dude so let's go ahead and the next thing we're going to do is actually go ahead and target the message sender input now this is the input which says what's on your mind i gave it a class name and i'm going to say flex one which will push everything else it'll try and take up as much room as possible because this is an optional field this is the main field so that's how why i chose to do that in that way now the actual facebook doesn't have this image url optional we added that because it actually simplifies how you can have the image functionality without the sort of file picker yep i like this comment says the submit button is useful for mobile devices you can make it disappear in desktop screens what do you think nice yeah so submit so very s is true yes it's a good point so the submit button is actually useful in mobile devices but um yes that's true actually very true good point so if you are going to be doing it that way what you could do is you could use something called a css media query and that will actually you can then conditionally render this component based on the screen size so it's very simple to do that um and you can actually go ahead and i think it's it's literally written something like this it'll be something like at media and you say when there's a max width or something like this you do win this max width of like a 1200 pixels then you would apply this raw and you would basically say show or like a visible or something right that's how you do that and that would say that that's amazing yeah so that's that's called a media query and that's what you'll be able to do and i actually need to move the comment so there we go and yo what's up logan how's it going man he says hey guys how's it going bill looks sick hey we got logan's profit with javascript he's part of the the clever programmer community as well so what's up man stay tuned guys moving on with the build nice he goes the facebook stories makes this build pop off yeah awesome do you agree yeah that was a fun thing to build nice um somebody said if only we can click the like button many times use your ipad use your phone use different gmail accounts get that like yeah your brotherinlaw tell your sister exactly the video nice oh my god we're at 1 900 likes on this video guys man holy crap 2 000 people liking it amazing and we're also good chat donations thank you so much sonny you're killing it man i'm glad hey cheers bro it's been amazing going on our live streams together and guys we'll have many more of these coming up so i love going live with frankie it's always fun nice so let's go so we've got the message sender bottom next so let's go ahead and give that a display flex which means that all of the children including the live video photo video and filling activity should go into a row right so there we go goes into a row and space evenly with justify content and then what we're going to say is for each of the options i'm going to apply the following all right so let's go down here let's go ahead and do the following so we're going to say padding at 20 pixels display flex which means that the icons now aren't sitting on top but they're in a row with them a line item center which means that these are central to the actual um icon itself the color is great and margin of 5 pixels which is awesome and then we're going to talk about you off sonny but i we just got a really really cool comment right here by abishek he says hey sonny thanks for so much hard work you guys are putting i have built more than three clones so far whenever i see video notification from you guys it gives me boosts to do more coding wow three builds man that's insane hopefully they're on your portfolio man hopefully you know you don't just keep them on your computer or anything share them with people actually even teach people and then if you're enjoying this guys share this with others as well we're at 1937 likes let's reach 2k thank you so much guys that's awesome dude and exactly like if we if we can motivate you that's insane like and he's done three of the bills which is insane keep it up abhishek saying and also i think i've seen uh a tag on instagram uh where you tagged us in it so like if that was you then awesome dude keep doing that and it's cool to see your work nice so um oh nice niraj bowada it says interesting live i'm here since the start thanks a lot for the live awesome dude glad you're still watching that's amazing nice let's go so we've got the message sender option at the bottom and then what we're going to do is we're going to target the text and that text is a h3 tag i'm going to say font size is medium i'm also going to push a margin left of 10 pixels which would push it away from the icon the next thing i want to do is also add a hover so right now when we hover over it then nothing actually happens so i'm going to go ahead and do this so we're going to hover over and you'll get a nice little gray hover effect now as a natural ui element what we should be doing here is for that element we should do a cursor pointer so if i save this now now it has that pointer element which is a lot cleaner than if we didn't do it without right so that's a lot better to do it in that way says having no idea about react.jso still able to follow all that you're doing and it's just amazing that's what we're talking about that's exactly the kind of style we're going for even if you haven't coded before um so core says i joined late is it too late it's never too late to carry on burning you can literally jump in now and you'll be learning something new we still have the react context api the realtime database all of those juicy things coming up so stay tuned yep yep never mind and also really you know most people think that they don't take the psychological or the fun aspect of coding to be an important part of it an important role that's really what makes most people you know stop in their journey as to become programmers and that's really what we want to share with you guys you can have fun you can have fun with your friends engage crack some jokes while you're coding that's actually going to make your journey go the long term so never forget that guys that's why we do it we teach you guys in this way and it's just you know pretty much two two buddies here hanging out and coding and teaching you guys on the on the path so yep exactly that literally it's just two bodies teaching you guys how to code that's how we like to think of it nice dope so let's go ahead and carry on so now we've got message sender let's go ahead and check it out so we've done so pretty much at this point message sender itself is functionally complete but we need to do two things we need to keep track of the input so right now when i type we don't actually track this in the state we don't actually do anything with that in the state so now what i need to do is go ahead and introduce two pieces of state so stay inside of react is essentially how we write a react variable so in this case we're going to have one to keep track of the input the input so here we say the actual variable name is called input and then we have a modifier or a setter function called set whatever the variable is called so in this case is set input and now what we're going to do is we're going to use the use state hook because this is a functional component damn dude we just got a massive donation jessica apollinar thank you so much 100 mexican pesos cn pesos i love it as usual all of you guys never disappoint me i have no words to thank you i work as front end dev and i've been learning a lot of new stuff you're amazing thank you so much jessica we've seen jessica before right she's dropped a lot of donations before she's always coming up and showing up in these uh in these live streams so we massively massively appreciate you jessica and that's awesome she actually works as a front end dev and she's still learning so like guys these cater for anyone who's starting out on coding even if you're an experienced developer we have people like frank logan who's in the in the chat right now who are experienced developers and they are actually still learning and continuing on that journey so even i by doing these builds i'm learning so make sure you guys are always upgrading going that next step and keep staying tuned and have this positive energy like jessica that's awesome thank you so much never stop learning guys thank you so much jessica what part of mexico are you from drop it in the chat we want to know and also we're at 1969 likes 30 likes away 31 likes away from 2 000. oh my god i'm so excited thank you guys so much 119 in chat donations dude wow that's insane love that dude nice and we still have over half a thousand people holy crap this is so dope once you say like that it sounds like whoa yeah it's insane because we just see a number and we kind of get used to the number when you think about it it's like yeah this is crazy right that's true so we've got this input set input and by default it's going to have an empty value as its initial piece of state we need to then import it from a react so what we need to do is go here and say use state and that will import it from react we saved that file and then we go down here and what we need to do is this is a very slick way of implementing this so here is where we have the input field that we want to map to our state right so we're going to go ahead and do a value of the input field it's mapped to our input and the input is the actual um the the key the variable that i've named it here now notice when i type so actually we need to go to the actual app sorry notice when i type so let's go ahead and do this notice when i type it doesn't let me type in so i'm actually banging away at the keyboard right now i need to actually add something called an on change and on change will fire off an event every time i uh i start to type and what we're going to do is we're going to set the input to e.target.value which is essentially what i just typed right so it's a very like sort of weird thing but that's exactly exactly what you're just typing in uh forehand kureshi says top quality content amazing delivery content quality sorry react is super cool especially when it's taught this way hats off to you guys i appreciate that dude massively appreciate that thank you papa react hey that's it papa frank nice so we've done that for the input fold and now when i type it works you see that so everything's good on that front we're going to do the same thing for the second one and we're going to give this one just a simple we're going to say image url right set image url there we go and for this one we're going to do the same thing we're going to say value equals image url so value equals image url and then we're going to say on change when we start typing in it fires off an event because it's an arrow function we're going to say set the image url to become e.target.value which is essentially what we just typed in now to test that everything is working and that we haven't broken everything we can go here to the image url and we can start typing in and it works so everything is hooked up correctly justin phillips says you guys make programming so damn easy and fun love that dude that's what we're going for oh man you guys keep us pumped man thank you so much appreciate exactly 1994 likes guys oh my god six likes away from 2000 let's freaking go that's insane dude that's awesome dude we're about to break 2k likes 1995 that's when i was born exactly 2 000 likes hey let's go insane thank you guys so much guys if you were here when we just broke 2 000 likes shoot and story and tag me and uh frankie and let us know that you were here at this moment when we just broke 2 000 likes that's insane guys thank you so much on instagram guys thank you so much that's insane yeah thank you all right so what we were working on is the we actually just went ahead and finished the message sender right so we did that and what we're going to do is also when we type in what we're going to do is naturally that behavior of when we sort of enter something is in what what we would do when we enter is we'll do some some clever database stuff right here so we'll say some clever db stuff over here but then what we would do is we would want to reset the um reset the values inside of this so now what we should see is when we type in so let's go ahead and type in so we can see type in here and we can go here and type in here and if i hit enter boom it resets the fields which is really clean very very nice right so now what we're going to do is sub courses should i show these projects on my resume yes 100 show them on your resume uh it will help you get a job and a lot of people are actually getting jobs with these resumes and we've seen it so make sure you go ahead and do that so now what we're going to do is we're going to go back to our feed component so feed.js and here what we're going to do is we are going to this checkout feed here we actually have the post next right so the post is the interesting component that we are which we know facebook for is how you can post content onto your feed and what we're going to do is just keep it simple right now we're going to go ahead and do this we're going to say feed dot uh sort of feed yeah there we go and the feed oh sorry no feed sorry post post there we go and let's go ahead and create that component so post dot js as such we do rfce boom we see that we do class names let's go ahead and do class name equals post and we need to go ahead and import the css files import post.css go ahead and create that file so post.css and now what we're going to do is and somebody actually just said it's it's really it's really cute that you guys enjoy and appreciate every little like and support guys we we see every single donation every single thumbs up everything that you guys give us in terms of support we see every single thing and and knows one thing is bigger than another like we really massively appreciate any support that you guys show us isn't that right frankie like it never changes for us like when we that's one thing which got us to this position and it's something we'll never let on to let hold of yeah it's true man like that's what i talk with cause a lot of times you have to be humble in your life because once you have that level of humility to yourself that you can enjoy every small win then you're gonna be able to recognize bigger opportunities because once that you're in that that mind zone of thinking like oh i'm too good like sonny can think he's too good but no he's a very humble guy and he's always sharing everything with you guys he doesn't think he's like the best or anything that's what's going to get you to the next next levels and we just got another donation by faraz khan thank you so much man and he says recently working with react and d3js have basic knowledge knowledge of react following your session will make me pro soon hell yeah awesome lots of stuffs you guys are amazing thank you nice man d3.js is a really nice way of handling data is in that i think it's number crunching pretty much so it's whenever you're handing numbers or sort of graphs you can use d3.js i think that's what you're using it for uh but that's awesome yeah really really nice uh somebody says man maybe mark zuckerberg is watching this live dude can you actually imagine mark zuckerberg saw this live like it would be so funny huh i mean i could man who knows like yeah that was in facebook and somebody was building out to be like damn these guys are pretty lit you know yeah imagine him dropping a donation that'd be insane exactly like hey this is mark here this is a hundred million dollars you know just a small token of appreciation nice it's what was in my pocket exactly yeah nice so we'll go ahead and we import that component which is the post right so we're gonna just uh sort of exaggerate and drop like three posts and each post is going to have a few things it's going to have let's go ahead and open up our post it's going to have uh let's go ahead this is where we get the props so we're going to destructure the props and we're going to get a few things we get the profile picture the image the username the timestamp and a message from our from what we expect so i'm gonna go here and do this and then what we're gonna do is we are gonna go inside of here and the post consists of a few things right so let's go ahead ahead and look at this main app so right now we actually haven't got the post here but we're going to go ahead and create it for you guys so the post has a few sections so the first one is the top so we're going to say post top just like we did before and inside of the post op we have uh we have an avatar and we have some text right so i'm going to go ahead and drop that in so we just got two dollars which says global persistent to keep log in on refresh please um so today thank you so much firstly for the donation so persistent login is by default when you do a username and password logins with firebase authentication but when you're using google authentication it doesn't persist you're right so we are we haven't actually covered that in this in today's world um but we will show that in a different build um it's a little bit of work to do that and i think we have a lot of stuff we still need to build so we're going to try and get that squeezed in instead of getting the uh persistence yeah thank you thank you so much appreciate it man thanks dude so now what we're going to do is here is the avatar that we're going to be popping in the avatar by default we'll take the profile picture prop then we have the um times so we're going to go ahead and remove this for now sorry so we're going to have a p tag so let's go ahead and drop this out the p tag here will say the time so it will say something like uh i'm just going to say a timestamp goes here right and then here we have the username prop so it's a h3 tag and so forth so the avatar is not defined so we need to go ahead and import that so i'm going to go ahead and do our little smart import trick that pulls it in at the top nice so once we have that we can see that we've got three posts we've got timestamp timestamp and an avatar so it doesn't look too great at the moment but we're getting there uh we're gonna have a bottom section so let's go ahead and add a another div which says post bottom uh such there we go and then this one is going to have the message itself which sits inside so this one will have a p tag which has the message itself so this would be the post message inside of that underneath the post if we're actually going to have another div which says post underscore image and this will be the actual image that shows up right so this would be the actual image like that um and then this will have uh and this will have actually a image tag which will take the image which comes this through as a prop up here so that that's where it comes in like that uh we just got another one oh damn from priyank again again thank you so much man yes dude you guys are so humble and amazing thank you thank you man so so much so much we really do appreciate every little thing yeah whoa whoa thanks to william cruz we know what chf means and that means i think it's uh swiss wiz franks right yeah yeah five five swiss francs that's awesome so much appreciation thank you sonny you think you can um can we see like what the code is connected to on the real build so right now you're doing the message and then you're doing the image right yeah that's what we're writing right now so where would that be uh so this right now is actually so the reason being is i think the database went uh i think it didn't go down but i think seriously yeah it might have got pulled yeah so let's go ahead and quickly try and log in if we can't then and somebody says the image is flickering right so yeah this is i don't know why that's happening guys but it's a very small problem uh that we can't really get around while we're live so i'm sorry about that but yeah it should be fine for sure but yeah what i'm going to do frankie is i'm actually going to pass in some dummy there so we can actually see the component as we do it nice sounds amazing yeah i think that'll be that'll clear out a lot of people's doubts views and also know exactly where we're at right now awesome so let's go ahead and actually do that right now so inside the feed where we have the post what we're going to do is i'm actually going to go ahead and pop that in right now so we have a feed and this will actually take in a bunch of props so let's go ahead and do the following so for a post you can have a bunch of different props so in this case we're going to have let's replace this so the id we can ignore that for now the profile picture let's go ahead and grab a profile picture so i've got one over here so copy image let's do this save the message will say wow this works i'm like wow this works the timestamp let's just go ahead and say like um this is a timestamp just for very like like very obvious reasons and then they're here we'll just say the username the student the instagram handle says do ssango or something the image uh here for the image we're actually gonna go ahead and grab an image just go to google images i'm gonna quickly pop it off camera for a sec so let's go ahead and google image because we never know what pops up on google images um let's just type in code i'm gonna grab a picture real quick for you guys so let's go ahead and use this one awesome boom boom boom and then here i'm going to go ahead and pop that back in right here so there we go now in this video it was fast yeah so that's it so we have like a we have a post here and i'm going to go ahead and post another one um so we have two posts and this one the second one is not going to have an image the first one is going to have an image so we can see two examples of how that will work yeah and then well that's a good idea frankie actually that you said that because then we they'll be able to get a very visual representation of what's going on nice that's awesome i see that mohamed asks what roadmap should be in one's mind and what list of things should one plan out like documentation class diagram and dfd are these necessary before actually writing codes for project um i can't actually see that uh so just say that again yep he says what roadmap should be in one's mind and what list of things should one plan out like documentation class diagram and dfd are these necessary before coding so honestly guys this is what you learn at like university where they're like oh you're gonna need class diagrams dfdes and this and that like truthfully screw all of that stuff like screw all of that yeah take it from a developer who's been coding a long time like honestly like it's only when you get into very like technical discussions and things like that if you've got a bunch of you developers sitting around and you need to break down a really complicated problem then maybe you might introduce diagram but even then it's kind of like a custom diagram it's not like a class diagram or dfds honestly i would say just start coding these projects right it's like start coding these projects start doing actual practical handson coding but truth be told guys yeah don't worry about all that stuff i remember because i used to do this stuff uh i used to like draw diagrams and all that and you just waste time if i'm honest like so don't bother wasting your time we got another oh we got another donation dude wow hdk with 100 indian rupees thank you so much man he says awesome content kudos to the team hey that's cp team the cp family thank you guys so much no i appreciate you all awesome dude thank you so much the greatest ever says screw all of that with british accent you know hey and guys and this is living proof so frank's a developer inside of pwj right now and he's had he has over 10 years of experience he just signed a sixfigure client right so sonos the company that do the amazing speakers frank is working with them right now and it says just he says just push to production no diagrams exactly guys just do it like when you make the mistake you'll learn but doing all these diagrams and stuff like that you're just wasting time so just start and do the thing as it happens right yeah like she already both says just do it just exactly you know he he actually had a point he actually was talking about code you guys didn't know yeah exactly now you know yeah so let's go ahead and actually style this right now so this stuff right here let's go ahead and make this look a little nicer so what we're going to go ahead and do now is i'll make this a bit smaller so you guys can see that um what we're going to do now is we're going to go to post.css and inside of post.css let's go ahead and drop it here suppose to css the first thing i'm going to do is do the following so i'm going to say a width of 100 a margin top of 15 pixels border radius 15 pixels background color white and a box shadow so you can see now there's a very subtle box shadow but you can see this image is messing everything up right so this image is messing everything up this is inside of a container called post image so we're going to directly attack the child and say it only should be a width of 100 of what the parent container is and immediately that pulls everything in all right so immediately that's going to pour everything in and it still saves the day a bit right so the next thing we're going to do is we're going to target the post top so let's go over to the post top and we're going to say display flex position relative so that way all the children inside of this container if we do absolute positioning they'll be relative to this parent container and then we're going to say align item center to keep everything on the vertical axis we're going to say padding of 15 pixels we also have a very good comment here by one of our own students david jonathan he said it's quite unfortunate some clients waste development time on it yes it's true they do waste a lot of time doing this stuff like the diagrams and stuff like that um but it's actually um it's a it's a it's a good point and david jones is actually doing very well right now and he's inside of bw speaking with him on one of the coaching calls so that is awesome to hear from you dude uh nice so the next thing we're going to do is for the avatar so the actual image i'm going to give it a margin right so that way it doesn't touch the text so we pop that in and it pushes the text away a little bit next thing we're going to do is add a h3 so i'm going to go ahead and do this so h3 font size medium and that will drop the text to make it a little bit smaller we're going to target that timestamp underneath which is a p tag a p tag sorry inside and that's going to be small and it's going to be great so that's became gray underneath there um awesome samet angelica says i recently did a netflix con and i received yeah and i received an amazing response on linkedin i think i actually might have seen this one um and you guys i feel more and more confident every single day credit goes to you guys thank you that's so awesome dude reading stuff like freaking awesome man yeah those projects are going to build up your confidence guys the more that you build the more confident that you'll get and also linkedin is an awesome platform to share to meet new developers and yeah like i said share your projects so sumeet yeah i think we actually saw that man that's amazing if you guys do use linkedin follow clever programmer so you can see what we're up to yusuf is the one that's actually posting there a lot so thank you guys so much exactly naveen just dropped a good question he says hey any clone with google authentication dude you are in the right place today we are doing today we are doing google authentication so you're in the right place my friend uh and also is esau mirai maurice says what do you think about style components and how to know when to use them a quick thought on this because i do like start components they're very powerful because they allow you to combine props with css in an easy manner that's all i'm going to say at this point but definitely go ahead and play with them if you have heard of them before and we'll start using them yeah we're at 2 2093 likes let's freaking go almost 2 100. wow that's insane guys and 131 dollars in chat donations that's going to be more thankful that's amazing thank you guys love that nice and the build is looking really clean with the with the new image precise man i love it yeah it makes it very very simple to follow makes it very very nice for the bottom half of the image now where the text is we're going to add a little bit of padding we're going to say margin top of 10 pixels margin bottom 10 pixels and padding 15 pixels 25 so top and bottom and left and right and we go ahead and do that and it pops in like this so you're starting to look very clean as we do this now the next thing we want to do is add those buttons that you see underneath so before we actually had some buttons under here which were like the like button the share button those sort of things right so how do we go ahead and do that so i'm going to create a div underneath here and i'm going to say div dot post options like this and each option is going to have its own div so we're going to say div post option so singular is going to be each of the individual ones right so the first one we're going to have is a thumbs up icon with a p tag which says like just go ahead and save that and this thumbs up icon let's go ahead and import that i'm going to import a bunch of things at the top so i'm going to go ahead and do this go ahead and do boom as such and also the account circle icon let's go ahead and do this so i've just imported a few different imports at the top there we go and this one actually you can see we get the like button right so you get a like button at the bottom so i'm going to do the same thing for the comment share and for the account button so i'm going to go ahead and just drop those in underneath here so these are the same things but for different icons and different pieces of text and the last one has a downward carrot icon so there you go and what we're going to do now is we're going to style it so each one had a post option and the outer one was post options so for the outer post options what i'm going to do is i'm going to say post options padding top of 10 pixels border top of a one pixel light gray which give it that light grey at the top and then display flex which meant that it went into a row justify the content to space them evenly so as it resizes it'll be even font size medium color gray cursor pointer so we get this nice hover effect and then the padding of 15 pixels so that's very clean and then for each of the attention sorry about that pay attention to the small details like that like the border top the light gray color of it sometimes like we don't pick up these little details but it what it's what makes an image stand out on your app so you know don't forget those little details it's going to take it to the next level for you exactly they're going to be really really important points guys i realized that i might have put the camera over a little bit on the side so i've just moved that now um yeah these little things are very very important guys so make sure you don't miss those um nice so now what we're going to do is for we want it so that it has a hover effect so when we hover over the option itself uh it's not so sorry for the first thing we're going to do is actually target each of those options and we want to center those things right because right now the icons are slightly off so we're going to do display flex align item center justify center padding 5 pixels and flex 1 so that they try and use up the entire container there we go and then we're going to target that text and we're going to push it slightly away from the icon so that's the p tag we give it a margin left that pushes the text slightly away and then we want a nice hover effect so let's go ahead and add the hover effect right like this so it gives it a hover effect and now if i hover over it you get this nice little hover oh it looks so clean now it looks like individual blocks of post super clean right yeah really really nice and now if we go back to our app.css and we can get rid of that height 100 view height which was stopping it from showing before because now we have an app which is long enough to show the rest of that bro look at this praharsh says wonderful stuff guys this is my fifth build fifth build loving it so much it's 2 a.m right now and it's third day in a row wow oh it's amazing man thank you so much for sharing appreciate you exactly and that summer there guys will pay off so keep on coming up keep on showing up that's awesome someone says well here is 5 30. esl maurice oh nice and says it's crazy to see that you guys are from just different parts of the world it like it's just seeing what we're doing and the fact is that me and frankie have never actually met in person which is insane and we're doing this stuff like so yeah we've got some insane missions yeah we will we'll meet soon dude definitely nice yeah for me for me it's 1 30 p.m at pst time and then sunny is in what time is it for you 9 30 p.m bst right pretty yeah nice man so it's late at night for you and yeah we're here we're all getting connected together at the same time learning react let's go exactly let's go guys nice so um the next portion that we're going to actually do is the widget right now the widget is actually it's pretty interesting because the widget is actually easier than we think to build this part so let's go to app.js and here we had the widget portion which was the right side of the app so when we talk about the widget we're actually referring to this part right here so this actually it's very very nice sort of widget that we can scroll down and see right that one right there so in order to do that what we're going to do now is actually go ahead and do the following so and what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to swap the position that they're in reason being is that so that way everyone can actually go ahead and see the widget that we're building on this side right so here we have the widgets right so i'm going to go ahead and create the widgets component so the widgets component and we're going to basically go ahead and do widgets.js oops that should be widgets rename widgets there we go rfce wait for it boom there we go and then we do move our screen to the left side bottom left side uh yeah i've actually moved us into the center okay you think that looks better oh we can oh yeah we can actually yeah we can move it there that's good i think it might yeah i think it might look a little bit cleaner because of a lot of things going on in the center yeah there we go nice that's better so so now we have div class name equals um widgets there we go widgets and then i'm going to create a import so i'm going to say import widgets.css like so there we go and then for the widgets guys so this is actually um an iframe so the way we got this is i think you can actually go ahead and uh it's an iframe that we got from facebook themselves and it links to the clever programmer page and this is something which is available on facebook i won't show you guys it but all you have to do is pretty much type in facebook embed and you'll be able to see that and suddenly what is the knife frame because i didn't know that before going into this call so an iframe is simply basically imagine like you had another tab open right and you had a website on that tab but imagine you're basically just rendering that just in a portion of your web page so it's like in some sense like an embedding another web page into your page right so that's the way that's essentially what we're doing so in this case where we have it like this is our feed we're going to render it here right on the right so what i'm going to do is now is i'm going to pop in the iframe so this is actually got a width of 340 a height of 100 and then here inside the actual uh parameters we're changing the width of 340 and the height of 1500 right so it actually gets a high sort of some height to it i'm also going to change the style here so it's going to be border none overflow hidden um and then this stuff you can keep uh as it is right but you guys can pretty much go ahead and copy that and it will work for you guys um and then what we're going to do is easy wow that's crazy yeah that's literally it and then we go here we all we need to do is go ahead and import our widgets so be careful because it actually does import the wrong widget when you do it that way so we want to make sure we import our local widget not material ui widget do that and if we refresh we should see now it says widgets.css does not exist so we need to create widgets dot cs i don't even think we do we use widgets.css but let's stick to the convention and now boom dude there we go whoa there we go let's go connected to the real clever programmer facebook page if you go to the check the facebook page you go check it out you're gonna you're gonna see that it's exactly these posts and you can see us live right there at that moment so that's exactly that's awesome dude nice check that out guys so that's the actual website right now um it looks super clean and you can see like look it's very responsive and you can actually scroll down this thing and you can actually see everything like this that's going on right now in facebook so this is a very nice enhancement that we added as a little sort of last minute i do it's very nice to have even in twitter clone we actually added a sort of a widget to the right side i thought it's a very nice addition so in this case that's a nice little addon to this great skill to to have honestly i feel like it's going to look so good if you guys apply that in different projects it it really adds so much more spice to that project and something here from who said this oh yeah so the leroy fernandez says what are the upcoming mern stacks builds about so son you want to take that yeah so we have three big builds coming guys we have the tinder the tick tock so in in the correct order we have the tiktok clone we have the tinder clone and then we have the whatsapp clone all when that are going to be built using the man stack and that is on wednesday thursday and friday respectively mind blown this is gonna be a stay tuned guys that's gonna be insane man that's gonna be a lot of fun david and sunny are gonna kill it for you guys and make sure to if you already did one of those you know builds make sure to add those extra functionalities or learn how to build it in the mern stack yep exactly guys make sure you do that and also guys please don't spam the chat because you're not going to get hurt if you do that i'm just going to block you so yep so don't do that yeah let's keep it to learn here we're at 2141 likes by the way that is nice let's go crush 2 200 likes guys thank you so much and 131 dollars in chat revenue man holy crap insane insane logan says i really need those man stack builds definitely we will bring that in yeah 100 so so with that said let's carry on strong guys so here we have the app and what we're going to do now is we are going to go ahead and actually build in the database functionality portion of the app so let's go ahead and actually build out the database part of the app right so what we're going to do now is i think the first step what we should do actually maybe is actually do the login let's do the login part first and then we'll do the the realtime database right so the login what we're going to do now is we're going to assume so to actually have the login we need to have some kind of user in this state right so we're going to say if there was some kind of user so imagine let's just do a very simple example so imagine there's a user right if the user was no then here what i would say is i would say right if there is no user then render the login page so render a login page so in this case let's just do a very simple h1 which says i am a login right otherwise render out the rest of the app otherwise render out the rest of the app so otherwise render out all of this stuff so that's how i would sort of at a very simple level approach this so this is freaking out because yeah whenever you have sibling uh components like this you have to wrap it in either a div or a fragment so this is a jsx fragment and that will fix that error so now what this will say is there is no user user is no right so if we refresh the web page it should actually say a login right and then once we like we went through our login that's just like our sort of login process then what would happen is it would render the rest of the app so in this case um i think it's maybe freaking out because i've used a normal variable okay yeah so you see we don't have a user but let's say i logged in and the user was just to say very simple level sunny right so now when we was if we had to refresh the webpage it would actually show the app so you're essentially logged in right so at a very simple level that's what we're about to do right so uh somebody says that you're about to do redux anytime in the future we're going to be using the react context api today so make sure you uh stay tuned for that pavan kumar whoa oh my god oh no you didn't bro oh my god oh my god with a 50 donation wow holy crap given so much to us as in value from you know the community donations helping other students out man thank you so much frank we really do appreciate you we got the same name by the way amen i resonate thank you and he says read that out sonny yeah he says oh my god just got the first huge deposit in the bank from the client they sent a speaker device and the new macbook pro all because sonny made an awesome clone of spotify so i could show it to the client i wanted to share this win hustle oh my god damn dude a brand new macbook pro oh my god and then the speakers i love the sonos speakers man yeah them speakers are insane and they're actually like they're pricey speakers dude they're really really good speakers yeah that's awesome dude frank oh man you're crushing it dude and i'm so it makes me like it's such a warm feeling when you said like it came from the spotify clone like man like honestly it makes all of this worth it yeah that was a fun bird dude oh man that's insane thank you so much frank damn dude that's a huge win thank you so much man i'm glad you have the money to bank too that that always is you know once that happens you know it's real before that you're always kind of like i don't know if it might happen but that makes it solid thank you bro exactly appreciate you solid stuff dude that's insane keep crushing dude keep crushing where we are frankie with the donations in right now damn now we're at 181 dollars holy we're making a fulltime job out of this that's insane dude 155 likes as well oh my god let's do it guys let's do it so now we are going to i'm going to move our image over to the right now so that's about there we go so now we're going to actually rather than saying h1 login i'm going to actually do a login component oh damn dude if fosu just dropped another five pound donation thank you so much that's amazing he says can't help it guys this is dope would you consider doing something with next js or strap js strap ijs at some point so i think it's a strappy js at some point on xjs yeah so 100 did yes the next gs i've used a previous job it is definitely um something which which uh is definitely tricky when you're picking it up for the first time so i would be more than glad to sort of go through this also to improve my knowledge on it so that'll be that'll be fun um so yeah dude it felt so 100 thank you so much for that donation and sg707 texas i'm sure uh wait no it wasn't that one they'll say tara slim says brother your haircut is fresher than this code [Laughter] yes nice thank you ifosa awesome dude so let's go ahead and create the login.js component and what we do is rfce and there's a bit of setup that we need to do at this point so i'm going to go ahead and create the class name class name of login so there we go and here i'm going to do import and i'm going to do login.css boom save that there we go and now what i'm going to do is uh did i create the login.css i don't even know login.css there we go all right so with that said now what we're going to do is we are going to go over to uh create this login component so the login component is fairly simple it's just gonna have a few things it's gonna have um a a container which says a login logo and this one is gonna essentially just have so if we go back to the actual uh build itself when we refresh we will have a container and this will have login logo and this one will have two images inside of it so they're gonna have the those facebook images so it's gonna have two images you have the facebook logo and then the facebook text logo and then we have a material ui button which has a sign in right so we're gonna have underneath that we're gonna have a material ui button which says type submit and so we on click sign in so it's going to fire off a function called sign in which means that we have to create that function so at this point i'm going to go here and i'm going to say const sign in so consign in equals and we're going to do an arrow function and this arrow function is going to basically do some clever signin stuff right so that should do that now this is what we want it to look like how does it look right now let's go ahead and check it out so let's force our app to render there by changing the user to null right so let's go ahead and do that and if we refresh this now it should go ahead and force the user to go to our new login component and this might fail actually because we haven't imported login there we go i thought so so we have to do that and we should see now it says button is not defined now so inside of here we need to import the material ui button there we go and we do that and that should go ahead and pull it in so there we go so you can see these are huge right now it's got a tiny button and then the massive one uh massive logos over here so let's go ahead and style this so it gets it doesn't look like this horrible stuff right now and the way we're gonna do that is i'm going to first go ahead and target that that image because with the image like that we can't actually see anything so i'm going to target the div i'm going to go inside the login container the first div the image and i'm going to say object fit contain to keep the aspect ratio and a height of 150 to bring everything smaller that will immediately pour everything quite neatly in right the next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to go inside the first div and what i mean by the first div is is pretty much essentially the the container which contains those images display flex direction column that will actually go ahead and change it and now guys you see this is at the top of the page there's a neat trick to getting anything centered in vertically and horizontally and the way you do that is you pretty much go ahead and do you target the overall logging container you do display grid place item center and a height of 100 view height and it gets this really nice centering right the next thing we want to do is target that button so that button looks really nasty right now so we're going to target we're going to say width of 300 pixels give it the facebook color and give it the uh sort of a white sort of background and font weight a little bit heavier but you see when we hover over it by default the hover functionality is is nasty we don't want it to change to that color we want to instead add our own colors so let's go ahead and add that here we're going to say add this color add a white background color and add the text to go blue when you do that so we save this now and we do this uh oops i've actually gone ahead and broke something there so i need to actually change this to be this right here there we go and now there we go so you see it's got a very nice ui to it and when we click it look at that you get a nice ripple blue ripple effect beautiful yeah i see right so what we can do now is we need to actually go ahead and that firebase file that we created earlier we're going to go into that file so we're going to go into that firebase file that we created earlier this one right here and what we need to do is we need to bring firebase into our project so let's go to our terminal and we need to do mpmi mpmi firebase and this will actually go ahead and install firebase into our project right it's going to install firebase into the project and then what we can do is we can start coding it while it's doing that so at the top of the file we're going to say import firebase from firebase and this will pull firebase modules into the firebase firebase variable and then we have a few lines so the first one is we need to initialize the app so this is the key that we got earlier this is our config file and all we need to do to connect our front end our react front end to our firebase back end is this where we say firebase equals firebase.initialize app with that firebase config so you just literally pass in the object right here and that will actually connect everything together and now what we're going to do is we are going to get access to the database so we're going to go ahead and do this we're going to say cons db equals firebase app so the one that we just initialized access firestore and before while we do this guys let's go ahead and go over to firestore and set this up so oh that's a bug on their side uh so we're going to go over to firestore and here guys we go into firestore we scroll to the top we say create database this is on firebase and what i'm going to do is they got a buggy website right now and we go to start test mode next we don't care what location it's in we click enable and this will actually go ahead and build us a realtime database on the backend for us so while that's doing that we're going to go back to our code and we basically use this and this variable will be what we use to essentially go ahead and handle our database stuff the next step is setting up our authentication so here we do const auth equals firebase so the actual firebase module dot auth and this one uh is actually going to allow us this auth is going to allow us to do things like logging in signing in and search etc now what we need to do is we need to go over to this tab over here so it says authentication so if i make this full thing you can see authentication go to sign in method and i want you guys to turn on google sign in so here click on enable and then you need to set a project support email so go here and let's just go ahead and click save and this will actually go ahead and enable the google login right so this is google logging in like this is google login service so what we're going to do then is we're going to go back to our code and what we need to do now is is actually tell the provider and then we need to actually get something called a provider right now firebase gives this in a very nice format we say equals new firebase.auth.google.provider and this will actually tell google this will tell firebase that we want the google login service now to access this stuff outside of the um outside of the file i'm gonna have two exports i'm gonna have one which is a explicit export which is auth and provider and then i'm going to have a default export which is a db because we're going to use a db in more circumstances where as compared to the other two so with that said let's go what i like about this build is that you know we're using react react is made by facebook backend we're using firebase and that is made by google and then we're using google authentication too so we're using a lot of the google's ecosystem on the back and then we're also using react which is facebook on the front so that's it's an amazing way for them to all come together yeah exactly it comes together so nice especially when we deploy it it's like it's really yeah it really really ties in together nice so the next step now is i'm going to actually move our image a little bit so we can see the signin button there we go nice so now what we're going to do is inside of our login.js we're going to have it so when we click sign in so to do the sign in stuff you would think we have to do stuff with tokens we have to mess around with all this other weird stuff and all that right but we don't all we have to do is we have to import auth and provider from firebase and this is our local firebase so author provider from our local firebase and then what we say is we just say literally we say auth dot sign in with pop up so sign in with pop up and you can see it pops up for us and then i'm going to use the provider that we just set up so the google one that we just saw and i will say once that comes back then get the result so whatever the result was and go ahead and basically let's just console.log the result for now where it says console.log the result and i also want to do something i'll say if there was any error for whatever reason i want you to go ahead and alert on screen the error message so they usually come back with some kind of message we can do that now frankie do you reckon that was it like do you think that's too easy or do you reckon like it's there must be more steps right like that's kind of like i mean they're i don't know man to me that was really easy i feel like you know there might be something missing but i don't know you tell me i mean it is insane because like we literally we click this button now and boom oh wait no this is the this is not this is not the local this is the local we're here and let's go ahead and actually hook this button up to our on click so we need to refresh so yeah this will actually uh oh so somebody said you've got to blow the air horn so if this goes in right now oh we just got uh an ars what is ars i'm not sure christian david dropped 100 ars currency let's see what that is that is argentinian peso argentine peso peso thank you so much man really really appreciate you really appreciate that he says why are we acting not vue.js sorry if you already answered this one thanks great content three points one the entry uh entry to react is much easier than any other sort of uh library or framework in my opinion two is the most wanted and in demand language at the moment and three it's just such a badass library like right now we're doing we're gonna be covering the mern stack we're gonna be covering we actually i mean we need a little like abbreviation for what we do like in terms of firebase that kind of stack i think we should get something trending um because like we have an amazing stack right here that we we build some really powerful apps off but yeah the main reason is it's super powerful the entry into it is very simple and it is the the mo in most the most wanted and in demand library out at the moment and that includes with frameworks as well so yeah 100 definitely go and learn it nice so let's go ahead and click sign in and boom we get our little google sign in let's see if it works and what i'm gonna what i'm gonna do is while that's loading i'm gonna open the inspector on the uh on chrome oh look at that dope right damn damn dude so just by pulling the provider that you had made on that other what was it was it the okay i don't remember what file it was yeah the firebase js one right you are pulling that provider to the actual the authentication on that other page what is it uh so we're doing it over here in this one so in the login one okay and so that's what's being pulled and that's why it works just by signing in with popup and then provider right because you can choose different ways for that provider to appear okay on the page it can be a popup like this that's amazing man it's really just like clean how they do all of this like and then even when we click this now so no it's keep an eye down here right when we do sign in let's go ahead and make this a little bit bigger but it should redirect back to the page and it will actually go ahead and console.log the user so this is the user guys so if i go ahead and click the user you can see it has my email it says my display name it even has a photo url so this photo is actually a picture of me wow that's insane so this is all my google like sort of like user authentication stuff like this which is insane right like it's really really crazy that we just did this that like uh and also sg707 actually gave a really good answer he says honestly it really doesn't matter which library he goes just learn the tech that can get you into the company you want really good way of putting it so true man and also i love the way that you every time you implement something sunny you test it out right away so i think that's amazing and it helps with the speed of your builds and also just saves you a lot of headaches at the end of the day too 100 dude like that's the main thing that we want right like we want to test everything we do it as we do it so now we have a problem though like we get the user at this point so essentially inside of here if i do result.user we actually have the user at this point now how do i then use the user at app.js right so how can i actually get the user here and i don't want to do prop drilling i don't want to have a piece of state and pass it down here and there so now we're going to introduce something called the react context api right now bro don't want to don't want to distract you but we're at and ninety 2195 likes man two hundred that's insane guys thank you so much we're also at 189 dollars in chat donations whoa man 200 almost for this build in this build in this moment oh my god thank you guys so much that's insane that is insane guys and they love us oh it just broke 2 200. hey you guys for listening paying attention smashing that like button we really really appreciate you exactly guys we love you guys and we massively appreciate you watching and being here supporting us when we drop this value to you guys we just got another donation by ethical whatever uh dropping in hey 40 rupee that's awesome dude thank you so much nice so guys with that said let's continue on strong so we have the login right here now we basically need a way to keep track of the user throughout the app regardless of what component we're in right so essentially imagine like we have our entire app so let's just say this is the entire app what we kind of want is something like that kind of wraps oops some we want something that essentially wraps everything right so it kind of wraps all of the stuff uh we just got another donation dude from the goblin 306 you're doing a great job my knowledge increases thank you dude that's awesome almost man i appreciate that yes poland slothy is the is the actual currency for that so from poland i love it man thank you so much awesome dude so now what we're gonna do guys is essentially what we have here is we're gonna wrap the entire app with something that i like to refer to as somewhat of a data layer right so this is a data layer and this is what we refer to as either redux or in this case we're going to be using the react context api so they're two different things redux in the react context api but there's the same pattern so if you learn react context api you can use redux very very easily right the same pattern basically sunny what are you yeah were you gonna explain that what do you what do you see as a dif uh so the it's it's mainly the implementation effort so redux is extremely powerful but it's very it's much more difficult to implement react context api is extremely easy to implement uh but they both use the same pattern so there is overlap right so there's lovely overlap there and also context api is really i mean like you can do everything you can do in redux uh without the sort of plugins and stuff like that but yeah really really powerful stuff so with this said when we push things inside of this data layer whether we need it inside of the header component whether we need it inside the sidebar component inside of the widgets or inside of any of the children components so imagine inside of widgets we had another use case so you see like it could be no matter how many levels deep inside of a component you go you can actually use anything that we push into this data layer all right so when we log in so every time so imagine when we log in in the login page we push the user into the data layer yeah into the data layer so we push the user into there and then basically what happens is once they're inside the data there we can access them inside of any component and we also dropped a really really good video about all of this stuff guys so with that said you guys can actually go ahead and check this out um you can go ahead and check all of this stuff out inside of that video but we're actually going to move what is it called it's called something like the missing explanation for redux right we got it on our channel exactly it's like the missing explanation for redux and that's actually a really awesome video and it will take you through everything that you may be unaware of or unsure about when it comes to this stuff but we're going to move fairly fast through this part so what we're going to do now is we're going to essentially have something called a state provider which is what we sort of assume is the data layer essentially so state provider dot js and inside of here guys honestly at this point i want you guys you can copy and this will be pattern recognition uh i want you to watch that video afterwards and it will explain but i'm going to quickly run through a breakdown of what this code is so at the top we have our imports we're importing the context api stuff we're importing the user reducer and the use context hooks this is essentially preparing the data layer so right here we're essentially preparing the data layer the next line is essentially something what we call a higher order component and we're going to be using this to essentially wrap our app so the main purpose of this block here is it allows us to have something called a state provider and we basically just wrap the app inside of the state provider and it provides that sort of data layer functionality now whenever we want to pull something from the data layer we use this use state value hook right so a nutshell that's what we're doing so you guys can copy that code and then what we're going to do is we need to introduce something called a reducer so reducer.js right now reducer.js i'm going to keep coming back to this file um but and then not sure what i'm going to do is i'm going to drop the code in right now and explain it so this is the initial state of the reducer so this is what the data layer initially looks like so right now when we start off we're going to have a user which isn't logged in and then no we then have somebody some actions right we then have some actions and basically what these actions are is imagine we had a data like when we have that data there you can dispatch actions into the data there so and then what we do is inside the reducer we listen to it so we say if you just received an action for example the set user action then what we want to do is we want to return what the what the new data layer will look like so we're saying return whatever it currently looks like but change the user to whatever we passed in as a user payload inside of the action that we dispatched and then if we don't listen to the certain action we can return the state now this may be confusing it may be sort of uh a bit like sort of abstracted but you want to go ahead and check out that video we explain it and break it down really nicely but the main thing is guys again just look at how we use this that's the main thing that i want you guys to focus on right so let's go to index.js let's go over to index.js and inside of here what we're going to do is we're going to have we here we have the app and we're literally going to wrap the app inside of the state provider component right so we're literally wrapping the app inside of the state provider components you see it's actually wrapped inside of the state provider and then we're going to import the state provider from the state provider file and we're also going to import the reducer and the initial state from that reducer file that we just created now those three steps right those three steps are honestly so somebody says personally redux state management seems more logical than the context api honestly it's the same pattern it's actually the same pattern you're dispatching things into the uh reducer and you're dispatching actions the reducer listens to them it's the exact same as what we do inside of um inside of redux so it's essentially like somebody said it's like a global state right it's like a global store so that's how you prepare the data layer now how do we use it so let's go back to our login uh login.js so login.js let's go back to login.js and where we have this console.log we don't just want to console.log here but instead what i want to do is i actually want to dispatch so what we're going to need to do is first thing we need to use this very powerful hook so the use state value and remember that was the hook that we built inside of the state provider which allows us to pull information from the um the data layer so this gives us two things it gives us the state and the dispatch dispatch is like a gun that we can use to shoot into data and it allows us to shoot different actions we need to import these two things we need to import this the use state value hook and the action types and then what we can do is we can say when we get back the login we can say dispatch right we say dispatch and then what we can do is we can say dispatch the type and the type that we're going to use is we defined it inside of the action types dot set users we're saying set to the user and then we're passing the user as the whatever we got back as a response the the user object now what this does is it pushes that into the data layer so now we have the user inside of the data layer why is this so powerful because now inside of app.js what we can do here is we can actually go inside of app.js and do the following so now we can say go ahead and don't use some basic thing like that we're going to go ahead and say remember this first one was the state right it was what the store looks like it's what that data layer looks like so we're going to destructure and say go and get the user out of it and we need to import the use state value so we need to go ahead and grab that import use state value there we go and save and now what happens is we should actually be able to test this phone and this will work right it's funny man amman jain says sunny i can literally listen to this as if they were a podcast solid comes that's insane i love that man that's really awesome to hear that yeah well working on the walking on the park or something you can be listening to this yeah that's amazing dude nice so now what we're gonna do is we have the login page we're gonna click the sign in button and this popup pops up like we see and then what's going to happen is we are going to click a login thank you very much to latvia says sunny you're great and anna says you're great guys awesome thank you so much we appreciate you we're going to click the login and notice what happens now so i'm going to quickly explain what happens so as soon as i click this we're going to actually go ahead and so let's go ahead we're going to sign in we'll get back a result right that result if we log in successfully we'll have a result.user what we're going to do is we're going to dispatch the user into the data layer right which means that the user now exists inside of that data layer then what we're going to do is we're going to actually map it inside of app.js and we're going to say if there is a user then we're going to we should see the app actually load out so now if i log in if everything went well we should see the upload hey there we go wow it looks amazing man it looks clean so we actually got the app loading right now we there's a few areas where we actually want to use that information so we want to pull the user profile image here we're going to pull the name here we want to pull the name and image here and pull the name and image here so i'm going to run through the app now and actually go ahead and do those things so the first one is inside of header so inside of header.js let's go in and actually go ahead and grab the so i'm going to go ahead and pull the information for the user from the the store let's go ahead and do the appropriate import like so and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to say where we have the avatar so for example on down here we have the user's avatar right now we don't have a source so the source for this would actually be the user dot photo url and this is actually the picture of your google account so we actually be able to use your google account picture here and then for the h4 what we can say is this one should be the user.displayname so this should be the user.displayname if i save that now once we log in in the header we should see the photo url and display name i'm not going to do it just yet i'm going to do this all in one so you actually see all this stuff come into play in one go then we're going to have the sidebar.js so let's go over to the sidebar.js boom and inside of sidebar.js right now we have a set value here so again all i do is i pull it from the data layer so you can see the power here is immense because all we do is we just pull the user from wherever we need it once it's pushed inside the data layer right so now what i'm going to do is i'm here i'm going to go ahead and oh we just got five canadian dollars dude damn that's insane salman he says matt clone yet again thank you for everyone it's annoying from everyone it's annoying how i don't know which clone to work on next y'all got to slow down low love you guys hey we love that dude it's amazing thank you so much man we're at 186 so we're four dollars away from breaking that 200 donation mark thank you guys so much we really appreciate this it's fun let's continue on let's get that energy up guys let's go exactly guys almost broke 200 damn we love you guys that's insane love love to see that right so now where we have the um so rather than having this source right here we are going to go ahead and do user.photo url so we want to use the same photo url here and also for the title instead of this i'm going to say user.display name so this would actually be your google name so display name boom we have the name of the user logged in that works really well and actually we'll go ahead and pop the user into the sidebar the next place we're going to need it is inside the message sender.js right so the message sender message sender.js so this would actually be oops this would actually be and did message ender would be here so what we need to do again is grab the user so let's go ahead over here and pop it in here and then what we're going to do is we're going to import then necessary imports so let's go up here boom done and then we are going to actually go inside and replace the things that we need to replace the avatar here would be source equals user dot photo url that would be the user's image the next place that we might have want to have it is where we say we have all of this stuff and then the input what's on your mind right so where it says what's on your mind let's actually go ahead and pop the user's name in so you'll say what's on your mind sunny sanger what's on your night uh what's on your mind frankie it's a cherry on the top i love it yeah you see all these little customizations actually add to the entire user experience you know so with that said you guys are 196 donations yeah i know man it's insane right what i'm insane right here i think you guys so down here crazy dude everybody's going crazy over facebook man wow it's looking freaking phenomenal and it's a giant build right sunny was talking about it and he's like he there's a user authentication on this one yeah login log out the look of it is pure like the new facebook look with the regular so it looked great i made an instagram post on it it's a pretty nice that's awesome dude yeah like oh you guys still got 449 people yo guys that is fantastic smash the like button if you guys are here if you guys like my new haircut and subscribe to the damn channel we love your face and break the 200 donations and let's keep going that's it let's do it i think this is a good question man uh ron dreyambani asks how how you can maintain the user logged in even if we refresh the page right so when you're using um the google authentication login you actually have to use the token to keep the persistence of the user but we don't cover that in this build right we don't cover that in this build because that's going to add to the build time and there's already quite a lot we need to do still but if you're using the username and password it will by default keep persistence so if you're using the username and password authentication with firebase it will by default do that for you so just a top tip there um and that will actually help you out we just got another donation dude we just crossed the 200 mark hey thanks to deepak thank you guys so much deepak this is i think your third donation today look at this somebody somebody play the goddamn airhorn nice that's insane man wow deepak is super super active i love you man thank you appreciate it that's insane guys that's the oh my god i thought whatsapp status king was google [Laughter] because i was like oh [ __ ] google just sent that to chat nice so you can see now at the top guys we've got the um the user's image the user's name the user's image the user's name and even says what's on your mind with the name right so this is super personal to what you're doing right now the next thing we're going to do is we need to actually go ahead and set up the um we need to actually go ahead and do the firebase instance so this is where we actually uh connect the database to the build right so um frankie can you hear me or is it going a bit weird yeah i can hear you okay fine cool nice so now we're gonna get everything to the database now right yeah yeah now we're gonna push everything and so now we're gonna basically we set up the firestore database earlier and all we're going to do at this point is basically go ahead and set up our collection so now what we're going to do is you can see previously what we've done is inside of the feed what we were doing is we were rendering out like these manually typed posts right so what we're going to do is we're going to create a collection of posts so this is just like a nosql db so just like you're doing mongodb you have a collection of posts in this case and then the document itself the first one is going to be the post itself so we're going to have a profile pic and that profile pic let's go ahead and grab this one so let's go ahead and do this and then the next one is a message and i'm gonna say i am from the database yeah wow wow and then then we're gonna have and then we're gonna have a timestamp and i'm gonna change the timestamp here to be the today's date there we go uh and then i'm gonna have a username so the username in this case is going to be let's just do uh this is anger or something there we go and then the uh image is going to be let's go ahead and add the image that we have right now there we go so awesome so that should actually yeah ticktech asks does ads display and clone uh no thankfully not yeah this is an ad free build yeah nice so i'm gonna go ahead and save this so this will actually add it into the database so imagine think of it this way a collection is just like an array of uh objects in this case we have each document so if i added more here it would each would resemble a post right now we want to pull this in so the way we pull this in is we just set up the database before uh previously inside of the inside of we set up the database previously inside of our local firebase file so we actually pull that in like so and then what we need to do is we need some memory so we need to actually go ahead and say let's keep track of the post so let's create a variable to keep track and let's go ahead and create a setter called set posts and we're gonna set up this piece of state and we're going to give it an empty array as its default value the first thing i'm going to do is import this right now so i'm going to import the use state from react there we go and then what we need to do is we need to run a code run a piece of code when the feed actually loads but we only want to run it once so what we do to do that is use a use effect hook so this is a very powerful piece of code and what this does is by putting empty this is what we where we put dependencies by keeping this bracket empty what it does is it only runs the code once when the feed component loads so i here i say db dot collection and what this is doing is it's actually accessing this collection right here so posts and then what we do is we say on snapshot and snapshot is basically like it's a real time snapshot which means that when basically anything is updated added uh changed anything inside this collection it will give us the real time uh sort of snapshot or like imagine you've got a camera take a picture of it at that real time point and then actually go ahead and pull it into your code right so at this point what we're going to say we're going to say when you get that snapshot update the posts so set the posts to whatever the snapshot is dot docs so this is all of you at this point you'll get an array of docs you get an array of docs here snapshot.docs and then we're going to say don't map through every single one right map through every single one and for each dock i want to return a custom object with an id which is the document id so this this is the id the unique id here and some data and the data is going to be the doc data and doc.data is essentially all doc.data is is this this stuff right here so all i did here guys was i basically pulled in all right so let's go ahead and make this a little bit bigger at this point so you can see that so what i did here is i actually pulled in everything from here so it's mapped this is a realtime connection to the database in three lines of code there's a realtime connection and it maps to our state right so it actually maps to the state it's extremely performant and it works really really well so with that said now what we're gonna do is we are going to actually render those posts so right now we can see we've got two posts here but i'm going to print the donation man super active navin thank you so much man we really appreciate you man we see you on every live stream you know stick through it actually apply all of these you know projects to your portfolio man don't just you know be watching it's cool if you're watching it's cool if you're enjoying the content but ultimately that's where you're going to get the most value out of this so that's amazing thank you so much 100 make sure you definitely go ahead and do that yeah and sunny every time that we make a post then it gets fed to the database just automatically pretty much not yet we haven't done that but yeah no actually yes if i manually added a post here then with the snapshot would fire off and it would actually pull uh refresh our posts variable with all of this information right so what we need to do is we actually need to show that on the screen so rather than having this hardcoded stuff right here what i'm going to do is i'm going to say posts.map so posts oops posts so map through every single post map through every single post and return the following so map through oops it should be an arrow map thing right through every single post and return the following so i'm basically gonna say uh get the following so return a post uh component where we have the following so each of these things right each of these things right here is going to be post dot profile picture poster id the key here is so keys are necessary for efficient react rendering so in this case we're using the unique id here and we're passing that as a key if you want to know more about keys i'd recommend reading up on react keys for performance rendering but then here you've got the profile picture message timestamp username and what this is doing guys this is just mapping to the post image post message post profile picture post timestamp post username and what we should see now is that if we've done this correctly let's go ahead and make sure the correct everything's imported uh in the nice way there we go we should see now a message once we log in that it there's a there's a post on our feed that actually yeah let's remove the naveen comment because of the code oh yeah oops i actually got that yeah thank you yeah thanks to kazi he actually pointed it out from all the way from the bean bag hey let's go oh nice so yeah there we go uh so now what we're going to do guys is we are going to sign in so let's go ahead and sign in and what we should see yes once we sign in the post that we is actually rendered on the screen is going to be fetched from our firebase database and then it's going to be rendered on the screen so it's actually going to get a snapshot so we should see it pop up here if we've done everything correct um okay so see so we've something happened but it didn't work as we expected it right so something almost say almost did what we wanted so let's fix that let's find out why it didn't do what we wanted so let's go ahead and check out so here what i'm going to do is jump into post and we've got profile picture image so you can see here we're not actually using the time stamp so here's a little hack for you guys whenever you have a timestamp and you kind of need to pass it and show the actual date just use this snippet of code right here right it'll save you a bunch of headache you basically say new date you pass that timestamp that comes from firebase use optional chaining because it will defend it against if in case it's broken you say to date which is something that firebase gives us and then you say two utc string and this will actually render out a readable date so that's actually a little hack for you guys and then here what we're going to do is see you see it showed something but it doesn't show correctly right so it's a bit strange so the username is being passed in let's check out what's happening here post.username let's check in here we did post.username okay so this should be pulling in image post or image there we go don't mean to interrupt you man but guess what my bro we just crossed the 2.3 k likes oh dude that's insane oh man you guys are amazing 36 000 playbacks what insane in just three hours and 30 minutes we reached 2 304 likes 200 in chat donations and 36 play 36 000 playbacks wow insane guys thank you so much cp family we would never be able to do this without you guys thank you so much for sticking around building these builds with us and just having fun all around thank you yeah honestly amazing and with that said i just figured out why the data wasn't rendering guys because exactly where's the thank you post because he's asking instagram 66. i know let's go i need i need that big thank you post coming dude nice so now guys inside of profile pic message timestamp username image because these are all pulled in right i pulled that inside of a data object which means that here i need to say post dot data dot image.profilebit.message.timestamp.username.image there we go now if i go back here what we're going to do is we're going to have to uh let's login so let's go ahead and log in my new andreas actually just said just join the family you guys are awesome nice dude hey thank you so much man we really appreciate you love it it's a family at the end of the day you know we're all here for one reason we're all here to learn we're all here to implement you know just theory isn't enough and really coding alone isn't enough either man get people around you that code and we're here for you if that's what you need oh damn frankie checked out oh i didn't save it damn it i didn't save the oh man okay so let me go ahead and save this let me go ahead and save this sister's do a refresh but basically it is pulling from the database now so let's go ahead and see so soon as soon as we sign in now if we see a message which says i'm from the database with a correct time stamp then the air horns are going to go off because this shit's about to get real because it's working right ready let's go from the database wow nice so you see it works guys it does exactly what we want now what we're going to do is we're also going to actually go ahead and add an additional line here so we want to actually order those posts by we're going to do order by i think it's ordered by yeah exactly we're going to do order by timestamp and we're going to do descending so the the most recent ones come to the top in this case right so that's awesome now what we're going to do is we are going to actually go ahead and add the functionality so that when we are when we type into the message sender field so the message sender field you see here when we actually hit the submit so let me go ahead and log into the actual uh deployed version so we can actually get this on the screen and it doesn't keep refreshing let's go ahead and login so now you can see what we're going to do our goal is right now is that when i type in here so like abc or something like that or like yo as soon as we hit enter and and we pass in maybe an image url it's going to push so remember previously i actually manually added this document right i manually added this stuff now we're going to programmatically do it right so it's going to actually programmatically push that information into the database and how do we do that we basically go ahead and say this so firstly we need to import two things we need to import the db and we're going to need to import uh firebase from firebase so this is from our local firebase this is from the firebase uh itself module itself and then here what we're going to say is when we hit the submit so when we hit the enter key we're going to go to the collection posts so we're going to go to the collection post and all you need to do guys is actually go ahead and say add and we're going to add an object and the message itself so the message inside so this message right here we're basically going to map it to our input then we're going to say the timestamp so the timestamp is a very clever part here right we say firebase so we don't want to use our local timestamps because frankie's timestamp is going to be different to mine because he's in la right now and i am in london right now right so our timestamps can be off so instead we're going to use the one that exists inside of firestore so we say firebase.firestore.filledvalue and then we say server timestamp so you're going to use the one that's on the server right now and that would mean that everyone say frankie pushes a message and i push a message it's going to be actually um it's going to be actually sort of at the uh they're going to be the same time right and then it gets rendered locally based on our machines or our browsers which is what we want so the next thing we're going to do is profile pic and here we're going to actually use the user's image so we're going to say user.photo url so that would actually mean that the user's image gets saved there as well and then we're going to add two more things we're gonna say the the uh the username should be the user's display name and the image should be the image url which is inside of that input field so the image url is this one and the input field is this one so if we did everything correctly right when we start when we type into this box and when we sort of enter it maybe an image url here and i click enter that should push into the database and then what i explained earlier was inside of feed.js this is a this is this snapshot always listens to any change and then it rerenders based on if it gets that change right so if we did this correctly and if i say it's true then everything should be working at this point so let's go ahead and sign in so this is pretty exciting stuff so let's go ahead and actually get a picture for this let's go ahead and get something like a let's do a funny gif let's see what funny gif comes up oops phooni let's go ahead and this like baboon is gonna come on right it's a low res baboon though so let's go ahead and drop this now let's do this but let's go so copy image address and then what we're going to do is so we're going to go ahead and do something that's language i love when he gives i know right so now we should log in so you see it's insane like the actual functionality of this app is pretty cool like when we see it so now our messages should load here awesome and then we should say something like yo it works yeah now i know what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna pass that gif in here and now what we should see is this image this is i'm logged in as my account right now so if i push if i hit enter now we should see a message pop in here with that image a gif and it should see even have my correct image and everything boom dude damn let's go oh my god gives coming out that's insane that's insane dude and look at that it was instant there was no refresh no nothing the date eventually sort of loaded in there you can see it works everything i love that dope dude and it works and this would actually work now even if i engrocked this and shared it with frankie it would actually work everything would actually go ahead and work in the way that we expect it to and it also supports without so even without an image this works and then we can do like a rocket emoji yeah so even if i do this it's able to just pull any image or give from the from the web right it doesn't actually have to be a jpeg or maybe or an svg notice it can do a gif so like it like for example that's how i'm that's how i am right now that's how i'm feeling yeah it's like oh my god it works exactly let's go hey guys if that made you laugh smash the thumbs up button oh man so we've got the little dog sort of like super happy right now so you can see guys that's a realtime database and everything's working at that point right so we have a realtime database we have um we have authentication we have everything in that front and this is pulling in here we have react context api we have a beautiful looking design right here we even have a lovely little embed over here on the right so this is a really functional app right now that we've got you see it's very responsive as we pull in we get that lovely responsiveness and that behavior that we expect um so this is really really awesome and we have some nice little hover effects we have some hover effects over here everything has been accounted for in the way that we expect it to be and the functionality works guys right wow so really really powerful exactly really really powerful and also guys we're going to make it so that we're going to protect our uh our app here we're going to say if the input if the input actually we're going to leave that one we'll leave that let's keep it as that we'll keep it as that that's good so so with that said now what we're going to do is i think at this point frankie we just reached the deployment phase dude oh my god my favorite who's ready for deployment drop it in the comments below if you're pumped as nas would say exactly guys let us know if you're pumped for this deployment like and literally let us know if you want to actually go ahead and access this app so we're only going to deploy it if we hear if we hear this from you guys so we're going to show you how to go ahead and do this and how to actually go ahead and deploy this um but let's go ahead and prep everything in the meantime right so let's go ahead and set everything up to you to make this work so we actually set everything up in firestore previously over here so what you're going to need to do is open up your terminal and inside your terminal what you're going to want to do is just go ahead and keep the app open over here hey we've got people saying yes please deploy let's go go live nice awesome right so hey we got so we got everyone getting pumped up for this right so now what you want to do is you want to do sudo mpmi dash g install firebase tools right so this line right here is going to install uh i don't know if they can see that actually frankie um i i can let me see oh they might not be able to actually yeah i've just made it so that you guys can see this right now so let's go ahead and there we go nice so you can see so this command is is important and this will do is you're gonna have to enter your password i can't take that dog seriously dude so staring right at your soul he is he's like he's like that dude that dog is ready to deploy guys so once that's ready now what we're going to do is we're going to say firebase i'm going to log out quickly firebase because i need to log into kazi's account because that's the one that we set this up on so let's go ahead and log out so i'm gonna do firebase login and what will happen is so you guys are gonna need to do firebase login when you come to this step click on y if you want and then this will pop up and now all you need to do is click on uh the appropriate account click allow and it will actually redirect you and it will log you in so that's dope close that you go back hey and now the thing is about to be deployed and dark thank you for 14 czar yeah awesome dude nice so the next important step that we need to do before we go live guys is we need to do firebase init right so this is how we essentially set everything up to go ahead and deploy the app so this step now you'll get this uh popups you need to go down with the arrow keys tap hit the space bar on hosting hit enter and then you want to click on use an existing project and then here you want to go down and find the build so we're doing the facebook clone today so let's go ahead and do that and then what do you want to use as your public directory this is very important guys you're going to type in build right so here you want to type in build so i'm just going to make this a bit bigger for you guys so you can see this so here you want to type in build right so let me go ahead and type this in so build build build there we go build that's very important and then where it says configure as a single page app you want to type in y for yes because react is a single page app now once we do this we need to go ahead and do mpm run build right and this will actually go ahead and create an optimized production build so what this will do is it will actually go ahead strip all of the developer tools out of the react build and it will push everything like a really streamlined version into the build folder right so we'll go ahead and make a very fast efficient version go into the build folder and then once that's done we can actually do firebase deploy and that will actually go ahead and push that build bundle we call it so it's called a bundle when it gets into that really optimized state we can actually push it and then that'll go and it'll fly out into the web so now while this is happening uh frankie maybe let's go ahead and answer some questions and we can keep the chat going alexandros what's up man we always see you here with your plus comments everywhere even on instagram when he messages me there's a plus sign in the store i'm always i'm almost wondering if he somehow like is typing this from the command line yeah right it makes me think that is he a bot is he a real person what's up alexandros i've seen his instagram page that's awesome dude you're always following that's i love it we like i said guys we remember every one of you that stick around through different live streams we know you by name so you know if you do some funny things we'll call you out so exactly you're sure to behave well on everything that's an ugly dog it's like a corrupt politician in the body of a dog he's just waiting for us to deploy like yo james hampton says i recently graduated from a coding bootcamp and have learned more with react watching your videos than i did the entire eight weeks in the camp awesome stuff let's go that's awesome dude i know dude that's insane guys here yeah that's where the comment is nice it's still i don't know why it takes a while whenever we're live it takes a while but it shouldn't take you guys this long when it does this um let's see let's let's take more a little bit more questions somebody says can you can you contact sidebar facebook please what does that mean guys write intelligent questions please oh we just got the uh so we this is what you guys will get once the build is done right so now you see inside the build you'll get this static folder and everything is built in inside of it so you don't want to touch the build photo right but at this point it's very important to know if you make any change to your code now you're going to have to run
