00:00 - hey guys what's up how's it going this
00:01 - is Kazi from clever programmer calm in
00:04 - this video what I want to talk about is
00:06 - I get this question a lot like how much
00:10 - should I call it every day and also
00:12 - where should I go to practice coding so
00:15 - in this video I'm going to try to tackle
00:17 - both of those concepts so without any
00:20 - further ado let's jump right into it
00:24 - [Music]
00:33 - [Applause]
00:34 - first of all let's start off with where
00:37 - you should be going to code so a lot of
00:40 - you guys get hung up on what resources
00:42 - to use what to code about it's sometimes
00:45 - a very confusing thing and I get it so
00:47 - I'll give you a few few resources here
00:50 - all right
00:51 - one of the resources you could try is
00:52 - hacker rank comm another resource is
00:56 - project Euler okay and these are two
01:00 - good resources start off with another
01:02 - resource is code fight comm all three of
01:05 - these resources are fantastic to just
01:07 - practice coding exercises when you go to
01:10 - these websites try to do the easy
01:12 - exercises first so this should give you
01:16 - a good basis of where should you go to
01:17 - practice doing coding exercises and
01:20 - maybe even coding projects now the
01:23 - different question is what should you do
01:25 - about when it comes to how long should
01:28 - you be coding every day that's the
01:29 - second question that I get very
01:31 - frequently in terms of the length
01:33 - there's no one good time but just make
01:36 - it a goal to try to say you know code
01:38 - one hour a day I get it you're busy you
01:41 - probably already have a job you're doing
01:42 - things in your life now that you know
01:44 - makes it a little bit more difficult so
01:46 - if you can make even half hour one hour
01:48 - stick with that and just practice it
01:50 - right it's okay to set a bigger crazier
01:52 - more obsessive goal if you fail it
01:55 - that's okay just reduce your time if you
01:56 - can't keep up with it but in the start I
01:58 - try to set up some kind of crazy goal
02:00 - like for example when I started I set up
02:02 - my goal to be 18 hours a day I was in
02:05 - doing 18 hours but I was doing 16 hours
02:07 - or 15 hours a day coding so um you know
02:11 - I had no life but you probably have a
02:14 - life you have a wife a girlfriend or
02:17 - maybe you're just a college student and
02:19 - you got things going on or you have a
02:21 - job whatever it is right you're busy and
02:22 - you don't have all the time in the world
02:24 - so when you have less time you know just
02:28 - go okay I'm going to spend one and a
02:29 - half hour 1 hour and I promise you have
02:31 - one or two hours right let's be honest
02:33 - like what do you do you have a job then
02:35 - you come home armed maybe you have some
02:39 - time that spent commuting maybe you have
02:41 - to study a little bit but if
02:42 - take away all the time your sleeping
02:44 - time all that you still always have 4 to
02:46 - 5 hours left so instead of you know
02:48 - going oh I just need to watch some
02:49 - Netflix or Channel or I just need to
02:52 - watch some Game of Thrones no you don't
02:54 - have to do that right it's not like if
02:57 - you don't do that your energy reserves
02:59 - just get like used up you know energy is
03:02 - not one of those things that can get
03:03 - used up energy is unlimited that's one
03:06 - of your resources that you can exploit
03:07 - and take advantage of that Gary Vee said
03:09 - Hustle is the most controllable aspect
03:11 - of your life right so and Grant Cardone
03:14 - says something similar like you don't
03:15 - run out of energy
03:17 - there's no such thing right and Grant
03:20 - Cardone and I also say this you're not
03:22 - tired
03:23 - you're uninspired right that's really
03:25 - what it is so focus on just doing the
03:30 - things that move you forward and you'll
03:31 - find that you'll be tapping into this
03:33 - reserve of energy that you didn't even
03:35 - know you had right you come from your
03:36 - job you're exhausted but it's you're
03:39 - really exhausted a lot of times of a
03:41 - life of mediocrity you're not exhausted
03:44 - of all the things that you're doing
03:45 - because think about it sometimes you go
03:47 - on this awesome vacation and you have
03:48 - all this stuff planned out right in the
03:51 - same day you'll go ski lifting you'll go
03:53 - to the pool you'll go like see some
03:55 - Museum I don't know you'll do like 50
03:57 - different things if you were that tired
04:00 - you wouldn't be able to do all of that
04:01 - right how come you sit at your desk at
04:04 - your job for eight hours and you come
04:05 - home and tired that doesn't even make
04:06 - any sense how could you be tired of just
04:08 - sitting on a desk or you know doing
04:10 - something random where you're sitting
04:12 - most of the times so being tired as a
04:16 - myth you just need to replace
04:18 - that's how you find time you need to
04:20 - replace the fun things that you think
04:22 - you need to do to free yourself up you
04:25 - don't have to do them and instead and
04:27 - you know I'm not trying to speak from
04:29 - just like high moral ground I was in
04:31 - that same exact spot where I would um
04:34 - you know watch to all those things and I
04:37 - would just like lay in my bed and you
04:38 - know blow okay I gotta watch chess or I
04:40 - gotta watch Game of Thrones or I gotta
04:42 - watch house of cards or narcos or
04:44 - whatever just replace all that or
04:47 - replace some of it with coding okay and
04:50 - it could be thirty minutes or an hour
04:52 - try to shoot for a higher goal I'm not
04:54 - big on making goals really
04:56 - small because when they're so small they
04:58 - don't get you excited so you're going to
05:00 - underestimate the work you need to do to
05:02 - improve so overestimate your goals set
05:07 - something that is exciting right if you
05:09 - do one out half hour a day sure you
05:11 - could become a really good developer in
05:13 - one or two years but how about you go
05:14 - I'll try to do two or three hours a day
05:17 - now you can become a pretty decent
05:19 - developer in two to three months and you
05:21 - can be actually looking to get
05:22 - internships and local or junior
05:25 - developer jobs something is starting
05:26 - three to four months so set a bigger
05:29 - goal spend more time learning the things
05:33 - that you need to do and that's how
05:35 - you'll get more time right just use that
05:37 - time you use on Netflix to use for
05:39 - coding when you get home and that should
05:42 - be something that hopefully excites you
05:43 - and gets you going okay so I gave you
05:47 - places where you can go go to code I've
05:49 - told you how long you should be coding
05:51 - for and I've also told you how you can
05:54 - find that extra time that you think that
05:56 - you don't have okay so with that let me
06:00 - know in the comments below you know make
06:02 - a commitment in the comments below I
06:03 - want you to say hey Kathy yes I'm going
06:06 - to be committing one to two hours a day
06:07 - to improve because if you don't do it
06:10 - and you just sit on your ass and you
06:11 - should watch this video it's not going
06:12 - to do anything right I you could sit and
06:15 - consume all my content but you're not
06:16 - putting in action you're not getting any
06:17 - further so I want you to make a comment
06:19 - make a commitment to me right now that
06:22 - this is something that you're going to
06:23 - be acting on and I will check in with
06:27 - you and everybody from the clever
06:28 - programmer community is here and they
06:30 - will check in with you as well so please
06:31 - do that and I want you to start doing
06:34 - this right away okay that's it for this
06:36 - video thank you so much for watching as
06:38 - always I love your faces off and I'll
06:40 - see you in the next video
06:44 - [Music]
