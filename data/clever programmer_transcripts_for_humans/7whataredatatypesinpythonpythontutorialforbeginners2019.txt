00:00 - - Hey, whats up guys,
00:02 - Aaron here from Clever Programmer,
00:03 - and today I just wanna make
a really, really quick video,
00:06 - about primitive data types in Python.
00:08 - So let's get started.
00:09 - (lovely hiphop music beats)
00:15 - Alright, so primitive data types,
00:17 - what the heck does that even mean?
00:18 - So, first of all, there's
a thing called data types
00:21 - in Python, which is just a way,
00:24 - that the computer can understand data.
00:25 - So there's different types of
data that the computer needs,
00:27 - like it needs numbers for math,
00:28 - it needs sentences to display
results to the screen,
00:31 - and it needs a couple other things,
00:32 - like there's a long list,
00:33 - but, there are four primitive data types,
00:36 - that I wanna go over,
00:37 - okay, four that come packaged
with Python, immediately.
00:40 - They're called primitive because
they're the most primitive,
00:43 - like elementary, base
level kind of data types
00:46 - that you can use, like
literally just numbers,
00:48 - like the number one, the
number two, the number 3.5,
00:51 - or the word 'hello' or
something like that,
00:53 - just something very, very basic,
00:54 - there's not like a crazy
amount of stuff in there, okay?
00:58 - And then now one more called Boolean,
01:00 - which sounds really weird,
sounds kind of funny,
01:01 - Boolean, b-o-o-le-a-n,
01:03 - but let me just type
these out, so you can see.
01:05 - So there are, first of
all, there's numbers,
01:08 - I said there's four
types, so there's numbers,
01:10 - this is actually split
into integers, okay?
01:13 - Then there's floats, which is just short
01:15 - for floating point numbers,
01:17 - and floating point numbers
are just decimal numbers,
01:19 - because of the decimal
point floats around,
01:21 - that's why they're called
floats, a little bit weird,
01:23 - and then there are strings,
which are just sentences, okay?
01:27 - And then, then there are Booleans,
01:30 - which are just a yes, no
kind of thing, true or false.
01:33 - So those are the four
primitive data types,
01:35 - I'm just gonna go over this,
so integers are gonna be,
01:36 - one, two, three, four, five,
01:38 - you can just start doing math of these,
01:40 - like one plus one equals two and whatnot,
01:42 - your floating numbers,
so this is like 2.5,
01:45 - negative 0.3778,
01:47 - like numbers like those, like
very, very exact numbers,
01:51 - and then you have strings,
01:52 - so strings are sets of
just like sentences,
01:55 - but they're always enclosed
in quotation marks,
01:58 - that's all you need to
know for right now, okay?
01:59 - Quotation marks, so you have like,
02:02 - "yo, how's it going," like
that, just as sentence,
02:07 - but it's enclosed in quotation marks,
02:09 - so, it's a little bit the
distinction little weird,
02:11 - I'm actually gonna have a video
that explains strings more,
02:14 - but, if you have "4" like
this, this is not a number,
02:18 - this is a string, okay?
02:20 - So, this is a string,
that's what you've to know,
02:22 - it has double quotation marks,
or single quotation marks,
02:25 - it's just a string, that's
all you need to know,
02:27 - when you're actually
coding on the computer,
02:29 - just know, those are strings,
02:30 - and then Booleans, last
are just like this,
02:32 - you only have two options,
true and false, just like that,
02:37 - and now what these are,
is they just evaluate to,
02:41 - or that, that was a big word,
02:43 - well, what they are is, it
just allows us to be like,
02:45 - okay, should I run this chunk of code?
02:47 - Yes or no?
02:48 - Should I run this chunk of code?
02:49 - Yes or no?
02:50 - And that's why Boolean, you
need a yes no kind of scheme,
02:52 - in coding, instead of just numbers, okay?
02:55 - So that's all everything.
02:56 - So a string can be anything you want,
02:57 - floats can be every number that exists,
02:59 - integers, every number that exists,
03:01 - but Booleans can only
be true or false, okay?
03:03 - And these are the four main
primitive data types in Python,
03:06 - that's it for this video guys,
03:07 - I'll be going into more detail on Python,
03:09 - in the next few videos,
but thank you for watching,
03:12 - and yeah, stay tuned,
I'll see you next time.
