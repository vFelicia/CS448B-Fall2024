04:37 - different things right we just start up
04:39 - first is the react Redux application
04:42 - right
04:43 - this is the code as you can see nothing
04:45 - crazy we have the home page the header
04:47 - page the section page this is our goal
04:49 - in terms of where we need to get to
04:51 - um but for now a few things let's go and

04:58 - situation
05:00 - um just open up your what is it called
05:01 - my computer whatever it has to be and
05:03 - let's go ahead and create a new folder
05:05 - I'm going to open up a new folder inside
05:07 - where well inside pretty much something
05:10 - called a terminal hopefully you guys can
05:13 - have that it's at the terminal right
05:15 - there beautiful and I'm going to zoom in
05:18 - so you can see it much better okay all
05:21 - right and let's go ahead and do the
05:23 - following thing for this you of course

05:58 - it's gonna go this until
06:02 - okay anyways
06:04 - I'm just you know passing time as it's
06:07 - kind of loading so as you can see it's
06:09 - creating the initial repository that you
06:11 - need right for for what well for
06:14 - basically for your application okay
06:17 - that's what it specifically needs
06:20 - somebody said hi my name is teslaco
06:22 - that's funny Happy hacking is what we
06:26 - currently have happy hacking beautiful
06:28 - it's exactly what we need to get to
06:30 - right that means our application has
06:32 - been complete not completed but it's
06:34 - installed all right
06:35 - uh once that you can go ahead and close
06:37 - this out no problem no problem and at
06:41 - this point let's go and go ahead and
06:43 - open up vs code I will do new window on
06:45 - my side I do not need this portion of
06:47 - this right here that portion goes
06:49 - somewhere else for me uh I could
06:52 - probably do it somewhere else let me go
06:53 - ahead
06:54 - I put this portion desktop too there we
06:56 - go all right beautiful all right so this
06:58 - is our views code let's open this up on
07:01 - the left hand side and put my testicle
07:02 - on the right hand side so it's a little
07:03 - bit better all right I like it as to
07:06 - file open
07:08 - file open beautiful go to GitHub and
07:12 - then go to Nas and then there's the
07:14 - Tesla code that we just opened up right
07:16 - so I will open up Tesla clone here okay
07:19 - beautiful all right so okay and let's
07:22 - see what we've got so far
07:25 - all right there's a Tesla car there you
07:26 - go beautiful
07:27 - um what do we have well to actually
07:29 - start this let's go right click this go
07:31 - ahead and open in the integrated
07:32 - terminal all right and what we will do
07:36 - is we'll do yarn what
07:38 - yarn start so we're going to use yarn
07:40 - this time because it's okay you can use
07:42 - both npm and yarn are both amazing so
07:45 - and yarn start oh
07:48 - that's going to start our application
07:51 - hope you guys can hear me all well yeah
07:53 - it's going to start our application uh
07:56 - this is not pretty cool this is actually
07:58 - live guys by the way this is I'm live I
08:00 - can see you I can see you right now in
08:01 - the comments if you say hi I say hi back
08:03 - to you as simple as that
08:06 - all right let's go ahead and do that the
08:08 - beautiful nice nice nice nice nice nice
08:10 - okay let's see let's see let's see
08:13 - okay all right so this is our webpage
08:17 - that we have right now this is not the
08:19 - technical don't you worry okay uh this
08:22 - is just a starter application that react
08:24 - usually comes with right
08:26 - um so at this point uh what are we going
08:30 - to do all right we need to erase some of
08:32 - this stuff let's go ahead and go to
08:34 - app.js right here and let's go to the
08:37 - header
08:39 - blah blah blah and let's remove this
08:40 - stuff honestly we don't need any of this
08:42 - stuff right here sayonara baby done
08:44 - you're away all right now we have a
08:47 - white screen which is pretty good too
08:48 - right we've got ourselves the white
08:49 - screen all right hit enter all good
08:52 - let's go to some index.css some of this
08:54 - stuff we don't need as well so we can
08:56 - remove some of this stuff which is just
08:58 - unnecessary too okay all right beautiful
09:01 - and so here we go now at this point a
09:04 - few things that we need to do as well is
09:08 - we need to divide this into application
09:11 - into a few different pieces correct and
09:14 - what kind of pieces would you divide
09:16 - this into well let's think about this
09:17 - right if I will if I have something like
09:20 - this right here's we have we have this
09:22 - application this might be like the whole
09:24 - app right so this is the whole app after
09:26 - that what do we have well we have the
09:28 - header right we have the header which is
09:29 - this one right this header might be
09:31 - divided into a few different parts as
09:32 - well we've got the logo we might have
09:35 - ourselves the menu like maybe we call it
09:37 - like the left menu icon or the left menu
09:40 - bar and then we have the right menu
09:42 - right there right underneath that we
09:44 - have the actual content or which is this
09:47 - we will call like a section right
09:49 - and now this section has a few different
09:51 - things right let's think about it okay
09:53 - well the first job is like this text
09:55 - component so this contains Like the
09:57 - Model S the order online and stuff like
09:59 - that right so that's we'll call the text
10:01 - component okay
10:03 - then what do we have we have a button
10:05 - component right here okay it's a button
10:07 - component that will contain the buttons
10:09 - like custom order existing delivery and
10:11 - so forth and our last one is going to be
10:13 - this really fancy bouncing don't
10:16 - bouncing bouncing
10:19 - bouncing uh Arrow okay
10:22 - um and that's pretty much it and our
10:24 - goal is to repeat these components so
10:25 - forth and so forth as you kind of go
10:27 - forward and so forth I see right there
10:29 - see right so that's pretty much it and
10:32 - as a repeat uh you know there's nothing
10:34 - else to it
10:36 - um and of course after that we'll figure
10:38 - out how to create the other Pages like a
10:40 - detail page and so forth okay
10:42 - all right beautiful
10:43 - um so let's go ahead and get started
10:47 - all right beautiful so as we said the
10:50 - first we need to create is going to be
10:51 - the header component and let's go ahead
10:53 - and do that so I will do Source new
10:56 - folder and I will say components on that
11:00 - component components uh commandantos
11:03 - componentos componentials okay let's go
11:06 - do a new file and we'll say header.js
11:09 - okay all right and I'm going to use
11:12 - something called react Snippets as you
11:14 - can see right here we have something
11:17 - called es7 react snippet so hopefully
11:18 - you guys can install that as well on
11:20 - your side
11:21 - um right if you install those don't have
11:23 - them go ahead and click install I
11:25 - already have them installed but what
11:26 - they will help me to do is if I go to
11:28 - ahead of that GS check this out all I
11:30 - gotta do is type it the following rfce
11:33 - done hit enter
11:35 - right like this is pretty cool what do
11:37 - we have ourselves well we have ourselves
11:39 - a function component that's what we had
11:41 - so ourselves right here okay and if I
11:43 - say header here right here right and
11:46 - then I'm going to import the header into
11:48 - app.js so let's do that right now so
11:51 - we'll go ahead and do import what import
11:53 - header from from what well a few things
11:57 - components so we'll have to hit the
11:59 - components folder slash header voila
12:02 - beautiful all right and we'll use the
12:05 - header now like so
12:07 - okay save that and let's go and see our
12:10 - new beautiful
12:13 - what is it our beautiful header
12:16 - component which is just pretty much just
12:18 - a head of text
12:19 - um let's actually make it much better
12:21 - right so here's what we can do now at
12:22 - this point guys is let's go ahead and go
12:24 - to indus.css and a few things I want to
12:27 - do is to change right
12:29 - um let's go ahead and Target everything
12:31 - right now right so again nothing crazy
12:33 - so far let's go and Target everything
12:35 - and the first thing I want to change I
12:37 - want to change the font family all right
12:40 - to make it more robotic It also says
12:42 - Rubik Rubik's Cube whatever's gonna be
12:44 - all right that's gonna be the first one
12:46 - let's go and change the color of also of
12:48 - this specific what of the specific
12:52 - um code of this webpage so this will
12:54 - apply to everything pretty much right
12:56 - this color will apply to every every any
12:58 - type of text right as you want to keep
13:00 - it consistent I'll give it a margin of
13:02 - zero so that there's all these headings
13:04 - do not have all these crazy margins
13:06 - which I don't like I give it a padding
13:07 - of zero as well
13:09 - okay good all right awesome and we're
13:12 - going to use something called something
13:13 - called border size oh no box sizing
13:15 - border box now for those of you who
13:17 - don't know what this is it's basically
13:19 - when you say the width of something it's
13:21 - going to include the padding
13:23 - within that div it's a little bit
13:26 - confusing but basically uh this will
13:28 - allow us to better control the width of
13:30 - the actual dips that's what that will
13:31 - allow us to do
13:33 - box sizing will say border box
13:35 - border Dash box
13:40 - there we go so I know I have a hard time
13:43 - typing sometimes guys so you can see
13:45 - all right let's go and focus on the body
13:48 - now so the body and we'll give it a
13:50 - width of what width of a hundred percent
13:52 - right here okay
13:54 - good and honestly that's pretty much it
13:58 - okay with 100 that's all I need so far
14:00 - okay good uh let's go back to our this
14:04 - okay you see our header now looks a
14:05 - little bit more different which is
14:06 - completely okay
14:08 - after the header what do we saving to
14:10 - create we need to create the actual home
14:13 - home page right so we have the home page
14:15 - and we have the header okay
14:17 - um let's create the home page now and
14:19 - components do a new file and we'll do
14:22 - home.js
14:25 - right
14:26 - all right and we'll do rfce again I love
14:29 - this one rfce and you got yourself a
14:32 - seat I don't know whatever
14:34 - all right uh same thing this one let's
14:37 - go ahead and do home okay we'll import
14:39 - inside app.js right here and so forth
14:44 - home Dash like this okay import it right
14:48 - here so import
14:50 - ante import home from what
14:55 - components
14:57 - componentos componentos
15:00 - component National home okay
15:03 - don't judge me
15:04 - [Music]
15:05 - all right good let's see what we got so
15:07 - far and we got ourselves a home
15:09 - components now I'm going to come with
15:10 - the header one for now just temporarily
15:12 - because I'm going to focus only on the
15:14 - home component right now okay
15:17 - and again I just want to make sure this
15:18 - is clear if you cannot follow along
15:20 - don't worry about it you know this is
15:22 - you know this will be available after
15:24 - you know the this is done so don't worry
15:26 - about if you cannot follow along just go
15:28 - ahead and review it again all right
15:29 - beautiful so the home component is there
15:31 - which I really really like
15:34 - um now let's focus on a few different
15:35 - things within the home component uh and
15:39 - let's go to home.js now for the styling
15:43 - we're going to use local style
15:44 - components and we need to install them
15:45 - first so go to your terminal let's go
15:48 - ahead and click Plus on it and we'll do
15:50 - yarn add
15:52 - and we'll do styled Dash style Dash
15:56 - components style Dash compo components
16:00 - there we go nope yarn oh yeah yeah but
16:04 - yarn add
16:06 - yarn there we go
16:11 - okay so it's going to go ahead and add
16:13 - the yard
16:14 - all right save that that's all good and
16:17 - we will now import import styled from
16:21 - what
16:23 - okay imports from styled Dash components
16:29 - good save that all right now for this
16:33 - component the first time we're going to
16:34 - create is something called the container
16:36 - component so we'll do is
16:37 - container no not container container
16:43 - okie dokie okie dokie container
16:47 - there we go container so that's going to
16:49 - be our first component that we'll do and
16:51 - with the container component let's go
16:53 - ahead is equal to style so this is
16:54 - basically will give us allow us to style
16:56 - the specific div right that's the power
16:59 - of style component instead of doing it
17:01 - inside CSS we do inside JavaScript and
17:04 - so it just makes things a lot easier for
17:05 - us right
17:06 - and now we'll do a height
17:09 - height of what 100 VH
17:12 - 100 VH
17:14 - good how are you guys doing by the way
17:16 - all doing good is everybody doing good
17:17 - everybody's still kind of on track with
17:19 - me if you guys are let me know let me
17:22 - know let me know let me see everybody's
17:24 - doing amazing
17:26 - somebody uh somebody says I like how Nas
17:28 - uses the different boxes to show us the
17:30 - different uh yeah different things
17:32 - that's amazing awesome thank you thank
17:33 - you
17:34 - I appreciate you guys all right so a
17:37 - height of 100 VH so let's go ahead and
17:38 - save that and let's look at what we have
17:40 - so far nothing okay it's kapusta it's
17:42 - pretty much nothing right now okay again
17:45 - what we're making right now is the what
17:47 - well we're making the component that's
17:49 - going to be this component right here so
17:51 - it's this whole component right which is
17:53 - this yellow component that's what we're
17:55 - working on right now right this whole
17:57 - yellow component that's the home.js okay
18:01 - um and within this home.js let's think
18:04 - about kind of well how are we going to
18:06 - create all these sections right we have
18:08 - this one section another one section
18:09 - another section and you can see the
18:12 - style of them was just pretty much the
18:13 - same you see they're pretty much the
18:15 - same right there so
18:17 - logically speaking what if you just
18:19 - create another carbonical section and
18:22 - that will allow us to reuse it every
18:24 - single time
18:25 - so if I right click on it let's do a new
18:27 - file and I say section
18:29 - section
18:31 - yes
18:33 - okay good yes and we'll do rfce here too
18:37 - and enter okay section is what we need
18:42 - to type in go to 100.js and let's import
18:44 - our first section so it's an import
18:47 - section
18:49 - from what from
18:52 - from what well because our current
18:54 - home.js inside the components folder we
18:57 - don't need anything else besides that
18:59 - right
19:01 - um we don't ask anything else besides
19:03 - that instead what we need is is just
19:06 - simply dot slash section like this right
19:10 - because we're already in the components
19:11 - folder
19:12 - okay let's go ahead and type in section
19:15 - to actually use it okay good beautiful
19:18 - all right awesome and then let's see
19:21 - what we've got so far nothing well we've
19:24 - got this section which is good
19:25 - all right in this section that GS now I
19:28 - promise now this is where the magic
19:30 - happens okay the magic happens now here
19:33 - all right okay
19:36 - so if we go to our section.js a few
19:38 - things that we need to really consider
19:40 - okay just how we consider this what do
19:42 - we say let's go ahead and create this
19:43 - text component first uh that's the first
19:45 - one but before even doing that I'm going
19:47 - to create a wrap so here's what I'll do
19:50 - I'm gonna create a wrap here
19:52 - right there wrap and that's going to be
19:54 - component we'll just call the wrap we
19:55 - can call the container whatever has to
19:57 - be and so forth all right let's import
19:59 - style components so import I'm going to
20:02 - use here we go import
20:06 - ante import installed styled from what
20:11 - from
20:13 - style Dash components
20:15 - okay good all right that's so good and
20:18 - then uh let's go ahead and create the
20:20 - wrap so const wrap is equal to what
20:22 - styled dot div okay
20:25 - start.dev now this is where again our
20:28 - fancy styled div component you know is
20:31 - gonna happen well they were almost at
20:32 - 496 likes if you can get us to 500 let's
20:37 - do that guys 500 likes they'll be
20:39 - amazing and I just want to also let you
20:40 - know guys by the way uh one really
20:42 - important thing down below what's gonna
20:45 - happen right now is we are we have a
20:47 - full-time Master bootcamp that we've
20:48 - launched a while ago and we have a new
20:50 - class starting in June and so there's a
20:52 - limited spots to go ahead and join and
20:55 - so we have a limited availability for
20:58 - new students to join um full stack
21:00 - Mastery we have a lot of students join
21:01 - full-time Mastery in the previous
21:02 - classes and it's been amazing so many
21:05 - positive results so many people getting
21:06 - jobs and so many people just getting
21:08 - results in general if yourself are
21:10 - interested in actually becoming a
21:12 - developer and you want something that
21:14 - will push you give you kind of a kind
21:15 - ability to give you some guidance give a
21:18 - give you proper guidance a proper road
21:20 - map like a full-on road map for six
21:22 - seven eight months right but you will
21:24 - stick with us the whole time you get
21:26 - mentored by Me by Kazi and the whole
21:28 - team here at clever programmer right
21:30 - like I said full story Master bootcamp
21:32 - is what we've created to help you do
21:34 - that
21:35 - um if you're interested go ahead we have
21:36 - a seat reservation down below to reserve
21:39 - your seat all it is is just a seat
21:41 - reservation and then we figure out all
21:43 - the financing leader this tells us
21:45 - you're serious and that's pretty pretty
21:47 - much it right like I said link is down
21:49 - below right but the most important part
21:51 - I just want to let you know not
21:52 - everybody gets in some people get denied
21:54 - unfortunately because you know you might
21:57 - not have either good energy or you may
21:58 - you might not be positive or you might
22:00 - just be you know not might not be a good
22:02 - fit so we look at a lot of different
22:04 - things for people to be able to join
22:06 - something like this it's a very much
22:09 - it's a very serious thing that we we um
22:12 - of course we take we take care take this
22:14 - very seriously of course
22:15 - so if you're interested come in there
22:17 - with good energy right put down a your
22:20 - sea reservation link down below and
22:22 - after that we'll get a call and then
22:24 - we'll figure out how to actually get you
22:26 - into the boot camp okay awesome that's
22:28 - pretty much it let's go ahead and
22:29 - continue on beautiful all right
22:31 - uh uh section okay
22:35 - what's gonna happen
22:36 - in this section uh the wrap is nothing
22:39 - nothing crazy the rep is going to be
22:40 - width of a hundred percent
22:42 - width of 100 V we'll call it VW VW it's
22:47 - like the car VW you know but that was my
22:49 - first car actually 100 VW which is the
22:51 - full view width right that's the full
22:53 - view width that's what it means okay
22:54 - then we'll give it a height as well
22:57 - and we'll give it a height of what of
22:59 - 100 VH right here
23:01 - 100 VH so 100 vertical height pretty
23:04 - much is what it says okay
23:06 - all right let's give the background
23:08 - color background of like orange just so
23:10 - you can see exactly what we are working
23:12 - with all right
23:14 - there we go right so this is all working
23:16 - right right the whole view with the
23:18 - whole view height okay all right
23:21 - um at this point let's go ahead and give
23:23 - it a background image and the background
23:24 - image should be this one right here now
23:26 - where you get this background image
23:28 - again what's going to happen is we have
23:30 - a Google drive folder with all the
23:33 - images down below right so if you all
23:35 - you have to do is just simply open this
23:37 - on this one up you open the Google drive
23:39 - folder the images folder and you put it
23:42 - inside your public folder like so so
23:44 - right now I have no images folder of
23:46 - course I can actually open it open up
23:49 - the Google drive folder inside my
23:52 - application let me go ahead and take a
23:54 - look at it where I can do that
23:56 - [Music]
23:57 - let me see where do I have it one second
24:00 - I think I have right here actually
24:04 - I have the images folder right here
24:08 - open and find wherever you'll find her
24:10 - there we go so I have my images folded
24:13 - right here right so this is the one that
24:15 - that you guys will get
24:17 - um if you go ahead and download the
24:19 - Google drive folder just go ahead and go
24:20 - description below download it from there
24:22 - and you'll be all good and then all you
24:24 - need to do is need to unzip it of course
24:26 - and then once you've got that just grab
24:28 - that and then drag it into the public
24:30 - folder right like like so just drag it
24:33 - in done right and now it's all in here
24:35 - right this is a lot of different stuff
24:36 - for you
24:38 - um you know between the model S the
24:40 - model 3 all these different images that
24:42 - you need to use okay so if you got that
24:44 - let me know down in the comments and
24:45 - then we'll make sure to take care of you
24:46 - okay beautiful all right
24:49 - uh let's continue on
24:53 - okay all right so when we do the
24:56 - background image well we have a
24:57 - background images called models.jpg so
24:59 - hopefully everybody was able to get
25:01 - those images like I said link is down in
25:03 - description below
25:04 - all right uh background image so far
25:07 - nothing's showing up which is completely
25:09 - fine I was going to remove this
25:11 - background noise I don't want that so
25:13 - hideous
25:14 - there we go
25:15 - um the image is actually there we just
25:17 - don't see it because we need to send out
25:19 - a vertically so we need to Center the
25:20 - actual background image and to do that
25:22 - what I like to say something like
25:24 - background Dash size
25:27 - is equal to cover
25:28 - not covered but covered boom you see now
25:31 - all of a sudden this becomes a very
25:33 - different image right there see
25:35 - okay now let's do at that point let's go
25:38 - inside this image the background image
25:39 - and to do that we'll do background
25:43 - um position so background
25:45 - background Dash position
25:48 - and we'll give it a center boom voila
25:53 - center right I'm acquisition back you
25:56 - know I I did this one
25:58 - back go round
26:03 - position there we go see now this car is
26:05 - pushed in the center which is exactly
26:06 - what we want to do then let's go ahead
26:09 - and make sure it does not repeat itself
26:10 - so we'll do background repeat now repeat
26:12 - so we'll do back round
26:15 - Dash repeat I will say no
26:19 - sorry about that repeat there we go
26:24 - now repeat but no repeat no right there
26:26 - no repeat all right so I'm not just
26:27 - going to change this point right if we
26:29 - still have ourselves everything we need
26:31 - to have and that's pretty pretty much it
26:32 - okay okay
26:34 - that's what I want you to focus on for
26:37 - now now let's go ahead and add in the
26:39 - text component stuff okay
26:41 - what we need to create of course is not
26:42 - going to be this text component which is
26:44 - right here and we're going to call
26:45 - something called like item text so item
26:47 - text
26:50 - okay and inside this item text a few
26:52 - things we need to go ahead and create is
26:54 - of course if we look at our Tesla clone
26:56 - what do we have we have a header
26:58 - and we have like a sub header and to
27:01 - make that happen here's what we'll do
27:02 - we'll do an H1 tag
27:04 - each one and this H1 will have the title
27:07 - for now let's just say the title will be
27:10 - Model S this is the one the title so
27:12 - model has for now this is temporary data
27:14 - placeholder data okay
27:16 - Model S okay beautiful and then uh we'll
27:19 - do another one that's going to be what
27:21 - the P tag
27:23 - P tag let's go ahead and remove that
27:26 - right
27:28 - the P tag and this one's gonna have
27:29 - order online for touches delivery right
27:32 - there
27:34 - boom it and I'll be honest with you it
27:37 - actually is touches delivery when I
27:38 - ordered the Tesla it's like it literally
27:40 - it was like Christmas morning I woke up
27:42 - in the morning and the car was there on
27:43 - my driveway it was pretty insane I will
27:45 - say like they bring it into you and you
27:47 - you don't have to do nothing you just
27:49 - sign and you sign in on your on your
27:51 - Tesla account and then you just say okay
27:53 - take delivery it's pretty cool I will
27:55 - say
27:56 - Okay order online for tattoos delivery
27:59 - all right and then once we got that
28:02 - let's go ahead and save this of course
28:04 - and we need to create the item text
28:05 - component here so we'll say const item
28:09 - text
28:10 - is equal to what styled
28:12 - right here
28:13 - styled
28:15 - dot div
28:16 - okay good all right and with this one uh
28:20 - what do we need to need to do nothing
28:21 - nothing too crazy we're going to give it
28:23 - some padding top so you can see you
28:25 - already have it here it's pretty good
28:26 - it's all we need so we'll do padding top
28:28 - Dash top and that will be 15 VH 15 VH V
28:33 - hush
28:38 - that's pretty funny okay and then we'll
28:41 - do text line Center because you know
28:43 - just to align the center technically
28:44 - already is centered but it's okay
28:46 - okay that's not Center there we go you
28:49 - see now Model S is right here right that
28:52 - part is done let's look at our next part
28:54 - that we need to figure out which is
28:55 - going to be the what that's going to be
28:57 - now the buttons right so that's going to
29:00 - be these buttons right here okay button
29:02 - group okay
29:03 - uh all right let's go ahead and create
29:05 - that component we'll create the
29:06 - component that will actually wrap these
29:08 - buttons right so uh the buttons that we
29:11 - need to go ahead and wrap are these
29:12 - buttons right here right so this is
29:14 - going to be the button group that we're
29:17 - going to create right now okay called
29:19 - the button group right button
29:23 - button
29:26 - sorry my horrible handwriting but I'm
29:27 - trying my best button group okay
29:30 - all right so say button button well I'd
29:33 - like to say button in Korean means bread
29:39 - you know button group and then there'll
29:42 - be a few bundles that we need to create
29:44 - inside here the one is going to be left
29:46 - button and then it's going to be a right
29:48 - button as well so we'll say left button
29:51 - button
29:53 - you like my accent and then the right
29:56 - button
29:57 - right button
29:59 - okay good and then of course all these
30:01 - buttons will have a few different uh
30:03 - there'll be one it's gonna be custom
30:05 - order so let's go ahead and do the
30:06 - custom order one
30:09 - so this could be custom order
30:11 - no I'm not I know what that was honestly
30:14 - custom order
30:17 - save that and the last one is going to
30:18 - be existing inventory
30:21 - existing
30:24 - existing inventory
30:27 - inventory
30:29 - inventory
30:30 - existing inventory that's the one that
30:32 - we're looking at okay beautiful all
30:35 - right existing inventory and let's see
30:37 - what we have so far
30:38 - um well that
30:40 - we need to create the actual components
30:42 - groups of course so we'll do that right
30:44 - now all right
30:46 - so we'll do the what we'll do const
30:49 - button group
30:51 - is equal to styled dot div
30:54 - uh that there for now okay
30:57 - uh nothing crazy so far let's go ahead
30:59 - and create the button the actual that
31:01 - button so we'll do const left button is
31:04 - equal to also style.div okay
31:07 - boom and now for the right button
31:11 - the right button we're going to now use
31:14 - the left button as a reference so what
31:17 - does that mean if I say right button
31:19 - put on is equal to as I've say style
31:22 - that divs can be styled button left
31:25 - button you see this love button why
31:28 - because this allows us to inherit all
31:29 - the CSS of the left button that's pretty
31:31 - much the reason okay
31:33 - now
31:35 - put the button group what are we going
31:36 - to do with the button group uh nothing
31:37 - too crazy so far
31:40 - um let's go ahead and actually focus on
31:41 - the left buttons that's what I want us
31:42 - to focus on right now specifically okay
31:45 - okay so left button all right
31:48 - um
31:49 - okay let's do the following
31:53 - let's see what happens here nothing oh
31:55 - we have some stuff we have custom order
31:56 - and stuff with that okay that's fine all
31:58 - right
31:59 - um for this specific section well here's
32:00 - we'll do we'll do background color of
32:02 - this left button
32:04 - is the following right background color
32:06 - is this color right here
32:08 - okay good
32:10 - that's the background color all right
32:15 - let's remove this stuff right here on
32:17 - this side that's the background color
32:18 - and then what do we need to do is let's
32:20 - do a height of 40 pixels
32:22 - height height
32:25 - of what 40 pixels okay
32:28 - and then we'll give it a width of 206
32:30 - pixels width
32:32 - of 200 256 pixels
32:36 - okay good
32:37 - all right save that
32:39 - okay show is all good and let's see what
32:41 - we have so far and so far like it's just
32:42 - it's nasty right so but it's okay don't
32:44 - worry about it right and then what we'll
32:46 - do is we'll give it a color so color of
32:48 - white so white okay now yeah white so
32:52 - that's gonna be the text color
32:54 - so you can see now we have the text
32:55 - color right here that's a white text
32:56 - color okay now these are two divs and
32:59 - let's go ahead and Center them in the
33:00 - center right so the mini will do display
33:02 - Flex on them
33:03 - Flex it always likes it ah
33:07 - display facts
33:10 - and then we'll do what uh we'll do
33:13 - Justified content to Center horizontally
33:16 - right horizontally means Justified
33:17 - content Center
33:19 - so we'll do justify
33:23 - let's go ahead and do it this way
33:24 - justify
33:28 - content that's gonna be Center
33:30 - good all right and then we'll do online
33:33 - item Center as well
33:35 - all right
33:37 - items Center as well okay good
33:41 - okay now what do we have so far right
33:43 - justify content online items Center okay
33:48 - um now these are two buttons right so
33:49 - let's go ahead now to make them more
33:51 - look like buttons let's go ahead and add
33:52 - a border radius so we'll do what border
33:55 - Dash radius
33:57 - right and that was going to be what
33:59 - let's go give it a 100 pixels
34:03 - oh would you look at that now we have
34:05 - something now we like to look at right
34:07 - uh it's going to get an opacity
34:10 - and it's going to be 0.85
34:13 - right
34:15 - okay so now we have an opacity that just
34:17 - kind of stays there which is pretty
34:18 - pretty cool okay all right then the next
34:21 - one is going to be what well uh let's do
34:23 - text transform make sure it's all up
34:26 - okay so text transform
34:30 - all uppercase
34:33 - okay
34:34 - nice that looks sick that looks amazing
34:37 - let's give the smaller font size as well
34:40 - so font Dash size
34:42 - it's gonna be watched that's pretty much
34:44 - just 12 pixels something's nothing crazy
34:46 - yeah there you go good good I like it I
34:48 - like it all right so that's that's the
34:49 - font size and then what
34:52 - um we need to stack that from left to
34:54 - right that's what we need to figure out
34:55 - how to do right how do you stack them
34:57 - from left to right that's the big
34:59 - question right so to do that uh well a
35:02 - few things we need to go the button
35:04 - group and say display Flex on this one
35:08 - boom
35:09 - boom right there you see right away we
35:12 - know what right away it Stacks from left
35:13 - to right that's what this display Flex
35:15 - allows allows us to do okay now how do
35:18 - we put this custom order this is that's
35:19 - the inventory kind of from more at the
35:21 - bottom that's the question I want us to
35:24 - ask right well this happens a few ways
35:27 - well because if we go to the wrap right
35:30 - the wrap controls what let me go ahead
35:32 - and remove this portion now at this
35:34 - point the wrap controls what controls
35:37 - this whole thing right this whole thing
35:40 - right
35:41 - this whole thing right and if I do
35:44 - display Flex on it I can actually push
35:46 - these away so that this goes all the way
35:49 - to the bottom
35:50 - right that's what my goal is right so on
35:53 - the wrap I'm going to say display Flex
35:57 - display
35:59 - I will say the flex
36:00 - Flex it Flex it Flex it Flex it don't
36:03 - forget it
36:05 - display Flex beautiful and then at that
36:08 - point what's going to happen is we'll do
36:10 - what Flex Direction column right so
36:13 - basic column means we're going to put it
36:15 - from top to bottom that's what that
36:18 - means okay
36:19 - nice Direction column
36:22 - there we go see now it's back to normal
36:24 - again now to actually fully make it work
36:28 - all I gotta do and actually push this to
36:30 - the bottom well I do something like
36:33 - um Justified content space between so
36:36 - justify content
36:39 - right and then space Dash
36:42 - between
36:44 - boom
36:46 - oh would you look at that it's like all
36:48 - the way over there you guys see that
36:50 - right there that is beautiful all right
36:53 - let's go ahead and do a line item Center
36:54 - to align it horizontally so interesting
36:57 - part is you need to know is justify
37:00 - content usually does alignment for
37:02 - horizontal section right so if you want
37:04 - to align something horizontally right
37:06 - that's what that's the content is for
37:07 - and usually align items is going to be a
37:09 - vertical alignment okay
37:11 - but when you switch the flex Direction
37:15 - it switches it flips now justify content
37:19 - is going to be for
37:21 - is going to be for this one is going to
37:23 - be for vertical alignment
37:26 - vertical and then align items now
37:32 - if I do center right here
37:35 - that's going to be for horizontal
37:37 - alignment whole horizontal
37:40 - you see what I mean so it flips when you
37:42 - do five Direction column you can see now
37:43 - the custom order they're actually they
37:45 - are actually properly aligned right
37:48 - now okay beautiful uh but I want us to
37:50 - focus on now is gonna be the the button
37:54 - group let's go ahead and take this
37:55 - button Google let's give it a margin
37:56 - bottom
37:59 - margin bottom
38:01 - margin bottom off uh about 30 pixels
38:07 - so it's kind of it's a little bit better
38:08 - now there too okay so I like that a lot
38:10 - better now right and what else do we
38:13 - have let's for these specific buttons
38:15 - let's give them what let's give them a
38:17 - cursor pointer as well so left button
38:18 - it's gonna be cursor
38:22 - cursor
38:23 - pointer okay save that all right so now
38:26 - there I can let me see Cur sir cursor
38:29 - okay save that I see I can it now exist
38:33 - as a cursor as well all right now a few
38:36 - things open passage is 0.5 that's all
38:38 - good opacity is good
38:40 - a few things I want to focus on
38:42 - um let's add this specific portion
38:44 - remember this one this this like
38:49 - well that is just simply an arrow that's
38:52 - all it is nothing too crazy
38:55 - um so to do that what we'll do is we'll
38:57 - create something called a down arrow
38:59 - as oh that's just an image right so
39:01 - here's we'll do we'll create it outside
39:03 - the button group and we'll say the
39:05 - following
39:08 - we'll say down
39:10 - Arrow
39:12 - like so source is equal to what source
39:15 - is going to be equal to images down here
39:17 - let's face G so we have to inside the
39:19 - images folder again if you want the link
39:21 - to it down below okay
39:24 - boom down arrow okay
39:28 - down arrow images down here right here
39:30 - is that defined again it's going to
39:32 - create that
39:34 - let's create that I need to create to
39:37 - create
39:39 - so we'll do here we'll do what const
39:43 - down arrow
39:46 - down arrow okay is equal to what is
39:48 - equal to styled dot image right there
39:51 - okay
39:52 - on this image a few things we need to go
39:54 - and create you'll do margin top
39:57 - margin Dash
39:59 - Dash margin Dash top that's going to be
40:03 - 20 pixels to give some spacing
40:05 - right and then I will give the height so
40:08 - a height
40:10 - oh height
40:12 - of what 40 pixels
40:15 - okay nice
40:17 - so it says styled style styled styled
40:21 - there we go
40:23 - all right so the arrow is now there the
40:25 - custom order is there so it's not the
40:27 - best solution as we need right so
40:30 - um don't worry we'll fix that in a
40:31 - second here
40:32 - okay so you can see what do we have now
40:34 - here's the issue this is now here and
40:36 - this is now here
40:38 - bad right because why because when we
40:40 - did justify content we did space between
40:42 - meaning it's going to create as much
40:43 - space in between every single component
40:45 - here right that's what space in between
40:47 - means right but how do we fix it well
40:50 - very simple by actually
40:53 - making this making this one component
40:56 - right right so for example
41:00 - if I say generous buttons
41:03 - if I give like this buttons
41:05 - okay check this out
41:08 - buttons
41:09 - okay boom
41:12 - what's gonna happen now what do you
41:14 - think
41:16 - oh new component correct yes yes yes yes
41:19 - that's going to create new components so
41:21 - called buttons we'll say const of
41:23 - buttons
41:24 - but is equal to style that div
41:28 - save that
41:30 - right there see you see what just
41:31 - happened right see this just became like
41:33 - this right see but they're beautiful
41:35 - right it's exactly what we need what we
41:37 - need for this for this right there right
41:38 - there see beautiful and let's go back to
41:41 - now our page application now
41:44 - um how did that happen well because this
41:47 - whole thing became one component that's
41:49 - what happened right this whole thing
41:50 - became one component and so this just
41:52 - pushed it down like this right
41:54 - all right uh up next let's go ahead and
41:58 - create a little margin between every
41:59 - single button so if I go to my left
42:02 - button I will do margin what I will go
42:05 - ahead and do the following which is
42:06 - margin I think we'll give it 20 pixels I
42:09 - think it's pretty good
42:11 - um either that or
42:13 - they only just maybe eight pixels see
42:15 - margin
42:16 - margin 8 pixels like this okay much
42:20 - better much better now I would like for
42:22 - this thing to hop
42:25 - so uh we're gonna make it hot how uh
42:28 - well we're going to create an animation
42:31 - we're going to create animation
42:33 - okay
42:34 - uh to do to make that happen here's
42:37 - animation it's going to be animation
42:38 - called animate down
42:40 - and if I go to my down arrow in here but
42:43 - right there check this out
42:45 - so right now nothing's happening because
42:46 - we have not created animation you see so
42:48 - it's just kind of like it's like meh
42:49 - right it's meh right now but don't you
42:52 - worry we got you okay don't you worry we
42:54 - got you
42:55 - um
42:56 - what I'm gonna do now at this point is
42:58 - very simple is I will go to innis.css
43:01 - right here
43:02 - and I'm going to create the animation
43:04 - myself
43:05 - right this is using keyframes right
43:08 - using keyframes is what it's going to do
43:10 - and I'm just going to copy and paste it
43:11 - here because I'm going to type it out
43:12 - all for you right and what these are is
43:15 - very simple here's what happened
43:17 - imagine like for example that you know
43:21 - uh so keyframes are like percentages of
43:23 - like uh of the actual
43:25 - um or the actual text or the deal for
43:27 - example right so at zero twenty percent
43:29 - you know nothing now at 40 we're going
43:31 - to translate
43:33 - translate basically five pixels up you
43:36 - see
43:37 - right there you see then at 60 I'm going
43:40 - to translate three pixels up now at 50
43:43 - we're going to translate to zero
43:46 - so that's what creates this up and down
43:48 - feeling so if I save this right now
43:51 - boom see that's what creates this upside
43:53 - down up up and down filling to do
43:56 - you see
43:58 - right that's okay the upper up and down
44:02 - kind of like feeling type and so forth
44:03 - right
44:04 - um this also creates a little bit of an
44:06 - issue with overflow as you can see right
44:08 - here so what I'm going to do is I'm
44:10 - going to give overflow hidden on this
44:11 - specific down arrow
44:13 - right here so this down arrow you see
44:16 - how it creates overflow well we can do
44:17 - fix that by just going a section right
44:20 - and I'm going to say overflow hidden
44:22 - overflow overflow X
44:26 - overflow Dash X is going to be hidden
44:31 - boom
44:33 - okay overflow overflow axis hidden let's
44:37 - see down arrow is that let's go ahead
44:39 - maybe fix it using what what can we use
44:42 - fix it using what
44:45 - if I maybe I remove this portion let's
44:48 - go and remove this
44:50 - okay I kind of like that I don't want
44:53 - that margin top it kind of pushes way
44:54 - too much all right so that's good
44:58 - overflow x hidden uh if I go to body
45:03 - let's go to index.css
45:05 - oh okay I need to also do overflow
45:09 - overflow Dash X
45:12 - it's gonna be hidden
45:14 - boom boom see to make sure we don't have
45:17 - the horizontal scroll bar that was there
45:19 - which would look hideous which I don't
45:20 - like all right so there you go so we got
45:22 - now our translation which is really good
45:24 - okay so we have a translation what's the
45:27 - next step we are going to work on and
45:29 - that's going to be let me see what you
45:30 - guys are saying something is awesome
45:33 - that's awesome sweet uh SCS is the way
45:37 - to go yes we'll actually go into scss at
45:39 - some point as well on this channel too
45:40 - uh are you building that using react yes
45:43 - I am change my Butters are not all the
45:45 - way down there what you put but yeah so
45:48 - now they're all down sweet now it's all
45:50 - good
45:51 - now it's all good now it's all good okay
45:53 - sweet all right everybody still with me
45:55 - everybody's still with me yeah beautiful
45:57 - of course you are because you guys are
46:00 - amazing that's all I can say to you all
46:02 - right and again guys let's go and hit
46:03 - that like button smash that like button
46:04 - to help us out with the YouTube
46:05 - algorithm that's it that really we're at
46:09 - 673 likes let's get to 800 that'll be
46:11 - great all right
46:13 - um all right so we got that portion look
46:16 - at this let's go and change up this
46:17 - button now the existing delivery button
46:19 - because it actually is different here
46:22 - um pretty simple
46:23 - because we go to our
46:26 - section.js here's our button
46:30 - all we gotta do is just change the
46:32 - button color so the right button instead
46:34 - of doing here nothing
46:37 - the right button will be the following
46:39 - the right button will be back on color
46:40 - of white
46:44 - background doesn't mean white
46:49 - boom oh let's go I mean we're gonna give
46:52 - the opacity to opacity
46:55 - right 0.65.65
47:00 - there we go
47:02 - okay and that will give the color of the
47:04 - text it's gonna be more of a darker side
47:06 - colors will be black
47:10 - there we go nice you see there you go
47:13 - now we got these two buttons and they
47:14 - look pretty good look at that look at
47:16 - that that's it that's all we just did we
47:18 - just did everything we need to do look
47:20 - at this huh how cool is that huh awesome
47:23 - all right so we're almost there now if
47:26 - you check this out all we gotta do now
47:27 - this one is just replicate the same
47:28 - situation right so if I go ahead and go
47:31 - to sections now
47:32 - apologize if I copy this section and
47:35 - paste everywhere
47:38 - all right if I paste this section
47:40 - check this out what's going to happen
47:43 - we have more section of the same
47:44 - sections
47:45 - there you go
47:46 - that's it now I want us to really figure
47:49 - out the one is like for example if I go
47:51 - small you see how the custom order just
47:54 - kind of like goes outside the boundary
47:56 - we can fix that too actually we can fix
47:58 - that very easily using like media
48:00 - queries right so
48:02 - so basically what we can do is on uh let
48:06 - me go ahead and take a look at it go to
48:07 - section here
48:08 - you see button this button group right
48:11 - here
48:12 - this button group
48:14 - is it's actually a flash Direction row
48:17 - but if I would go ahead on the media
48:19 - which is what I can do
48:21 - I can do media width like this so
48:24 - on the max with basically four four like
48:28 - small uh Max width of 768 pixels those
48:32 - are like small um screens I do flash
48:34 - actually column and so they go into
48:36 - column basically meaning from top to
48:39 - bottom like this all right so to this
48:41 - side you see that just happened look at
48:42 - there
48:43 - you see
48:47 - right and how this happened because when
48:50 - the width becomes 768 pixels you see
48:54 - it applies this right here CSS flag
48:58 - Direction column that's what allows us
48:59 - to do this and that's it there's nothing
49:01 - crazier than that honestly all right so
49:03 - now
49:04 - here's the question now
49:06 - um how do we go ahead and make these
49:07 - Model S stuff and make have all this
49:09 - stuff working differently right because
49:10 - what we have right now is just open the
49:12 - list and of course we have model y by
49:14 - the way this is the one oh this is
49:15 - actually the one I have by the way such
49:16 - a beautiful card look at this oh so good
49:19 - Ah that's such a good car I love it the
49:24 - Special is in this blue color it's so
49:26 - good wouldn't you guys agree with me
49:27 - like in a blue color like that's my
49:29 - favorite color by the way yeah uh
49:32 - anyways uh let's go ahead and do the
49:33 - following we have all these sections
49:36 - right
49:36 - and they're all the same so the question
49:39 - is like how do we make them different
49:40 - right how do we make them different so
49:41 - they're all different I guess I can say
49:44 - um well we could just pass in something
49:45 - called props right and what are props
49:47 - props are like parameters for a function
49:49 - that's pretty much all it is it's a
49:51 - parameter for a function right so if we
49:54 - currently have the model S right and we
49:57 - have one section we can reuse this just
49:58 - change the title here
50:00 - so here's what I'll do
50:02 - I'll go to home or let's go I'll go to
50:04 - home here and for the section here look
50:07 - we'll pass in a few parameters it's just
50:09 - kind of like you're passing parameters
50:10 - for a function that's pretty much it
50:13 - inside here I will pass in two for three
50:15 - parameters so let's go ahead and do
50:16 - title okay not like this title is equal
50:19 - to what and this is going to be Model S
50:23 - right and then the description is all
50:26 - gonna be well pretty much you know
50:28 - delivery so the screen is going to be
50:30 - ordered online
50:32 - the description right here let me go
50:35 - ahead and make this beggar for you order
50:37 - online for touches the description
50:39 - after that let's go ahead and do what
50:41 - let's do background image
50:46 - background image that's with the model
50:48 - S1 then we'll do the left button text
50:53 - right we have a left button
50:56 - that's gonna be the custom order and
50:57 - then the right button text is going to
50:59 - be existing inventory
51:02 - there you go
51:04 - okay let's go ahead and comment this
51:07 - portion of four temporarily okay because
51:10 - I want to show you how we're going to do
51:11 - this so this gets passed into props if I
51:14 - go into the section itself
51:16 - let's go hang on the section itself okay
51:18 - and I have props here they're basically
51:21 - like parameters if I just click install
51:23 - login
51:25 - cancel the log prompts don't visit
51:28 - I'm gonna show you this for a second
51:29 - here so look props right clicked inspect
51:32 - element on this one
51:33 - and I will show it to you within the
51:35 - console right here good all it is is
51:39 - props just an object like that's all
51:41 - pretty much is and look at this all this
51:43 - stuff has been passed in right the
51:45 - background image the description the
51:47 - title and so forth and so now all I do
51:49 - is something like for example I'll do
51:50 - this
51:51 - under the following
51:53 - what I do I do props
51:56 - props that What DOT
51:59 - title
52:01 - all right I save that
52:03 - Raza title look at that
52:06 - look at that model S right here see that
52:09 - title like it was replaced by the actual
52:12 - title within the actual what the actual
52:14 - component right that's all we pretty
52:16 - much had to do
52:18 - okay now we can't even be smart about
52:20 - this by doing the following we can
52:22 - unpack this using something like this so
52:24 - I can do it like this
52:27 - title boom right there
52:31 - how cool is that okay okay how cool is
52:35 - that check this out so title is right
52:37 - there
52:38 - and I can replace this with title
52:40 - and all this done is this basically just
52:42 - unpacks this whole object this whole
52:44 - object has key and no key like
52:47 - background image and so forth but this
52:48 - right here is called unpacking and we're
52:50 - unpacking the object to include to
52:52 - actually just get the get the actual
52:54 - Keys that's that's all pretty much does
52:55 - all right so let's say let's go ahead
52:58 - and stop this for now good all right so
53:01 - we have that next one that we're going
53:03 - to unpack is which one that's a
53:04 - description
53:06 - good description which is which one
53:09 - comma description and we can use that
53:13 - here now
53:14 - boom boom
53:16 - description boom right there awesome you
53:20 - see again shows up right here okay
53:22 - beautiful just just the way we like it
53:25 - okay next step is going to be what the
53:27 - actual left button text so this is this
53:29 - one
53:30 - left button text right here
53:33 - that button text is going to be this one
53:36 - and then
53:37 - right there and then the right button
53:39 - text is going to be right here
53:42 - right button text
53:46 - so we'll use that as a prop as well okay
53:49 - right by text of course we do unpack
53:51 - them as well so we'll do what left
53:53 - button text
53:54 - copy that left button text right here
53:58 - comma right button text
54:02 - command C command V all right so we have
54:05 - unpacked all of these items inside here
54:07 - so if we save that right you can see you
54:09 - know still and nothing really changes
54:10 - but here's what we can change if I go to
54:13 - home and if I uncomment some of this
54:16 - stuff okay now I have three different
54:17 - sections what I can do is just change
54:20 - the actual data so here's what I can do
54:22 - here
54:23 - inside this one I can give it the
54:25 - following here's my data here
54:29 - boom
54:31 - this one is title model.p what model y p
54:34 - y model dot y That's the uh they asked
54:36 - the other one description order online
54:38 - background images now model Y image and
54:41 - then left button text custom order and
54:42 - same thing here so if I save this
54:47 - oh look at that you see model y
54:52 - has changed now one thing has not
54:55 - changed is the actual image and we'll
54:56 - focus that we'll we'll fix that in a
54:58 - second here next one let's do model
55:00 - three
55:02 - okay let's do model 3 now same thing you
55:04 - see so all we do is we're showing the
55:06 - props we're just passing different props
55:07 - and we're using the same HTML that's the
55:09 - coolest part about react.js
55:12 - good boom there we go save that let's
55:16 - see model three now again image does not
55:19 - change we'll change that in a little bit
55:20 - okay
55:22 - next one model X let's do the model X1
55:25 - Model X
55:26 - all right we'll do the following there
55:28 - so Model X
55:30 - okay
55:31 - Papa
55:34 - there we go
55:37 - okay model X all right same thing look
55:40 - at this model X you see it all just kind
55:43 - of works you know automatically no
55:44 - problem whatsoever now the one big thing
55:46 - we need to figure out is okay well how
55:48 - come the images are not showing well in
55:51 - the section because the image is the
55:52 - same right the image is which image it's
55:55 - uh it's this image right here that's a
55:56 - background image right
55:58 - um to fix that it's pretty simple
55:59 - actually
56:01 - let's go ahead and go to the home.js and
56:04 - inside actually let's go to section.js
56:05 - my bad section
56:08 - and we need to pass in the actual
56:11 - background image you see we pass on this
56:12 - background image let's go ahead and copy
56:14 - this background image go to section
56:17 - and we'll go ahead and unpack this right
56:19 - here
56:20 - comma unpack it
56:22 - right here unpack it
56:24 - so now we have it you know we can
56:25 - actually have it inside our component
56:27 - and we need to use it somehow actually
56:30 - okay how do we use it well we use it by
56:33 - actually passing in
56:34 - um well passing an actual component or a
56:37 - prop into a style component because you
56:39 - can do that too
56:40 - serious audio
56:41 - BG background image background emit
56:45 - background image and we'll say what
56:47 - equal
56:49 - boom
56:50 - right BG image they could have
56:52 - background image
56:53 - that's all and now all we do is inside
56:56 - what
56:58 - is inside our actual what our actual BG
57:02 - image will wrap see how we have the wrap
57:04 - here
57:05 - basically instead of doing this here's
57:07 - what we'll do in this case
57:09 - do like this we'll say
57:12 - background image
57:15 - back on this image okay
57:18 - let me just do it properly so you guys
57:20 - can have it so right here background
57:22 - image okay and instead of doing like
57:24 - this I'll do like this
57:27 - okay props so we can actually get props
57:31 - inside style components we'll do props
57:34 - okay
57:36 - and after props what are we gonna say
57:39 - check this out
57:42 - okay
57:45 - we'll give a URL here so say URL
57:50 - that I actually will do like this we'll
57:52 - say URL
57:54 - and we'll be
57:56 - uh Dash images
57:59 - Dash
58:01 - Dash the actual prop that we just passed
58:04 - in
58:05 - Dash what
58:06 - that's what
58:08 - huh

58:21 - perhaps.what
58:24 - WG image right there after BG image
58:28 - WG image
58:30 - okay

58:38 - good
58:40 - okay
58:42 - let's see let's see let's see and then
58:43 - we of course I think I think we need to
58:44 - close it as well let me go ahead and
58:45 - make sure it's all good so that's all
58:47 - good that must be all good URL is right
58:50 - here that's the URL
58:52 - icon image
58:54 - yeah I don't think that's an issue all
58:56 - right let's go and say this
58:59 - background image okay
59:02 - cool
59:03 - now you're ready let's see if it
59:05 - actually changes anything so what's
59:06 - gonna happen here we pass in the
59:08 - background image here

59:13 - that gets passed into the rap style
59:15 - component
59:16 - right there see VG image
59:18 - then that gets back to the prop so we
59:20 - have we get props from the actual style

62:33 - now button and then because we only have
62:35 - one button here this created one issue
62:37 - well the fact that this channel button
62:39 - is on the center which of course is bad
62:41 - so how do we fix that
62:43 - pretty simple
62:44 - if I now go to my section.js

72:50 - um what does it have well we've got
72:53 - ourselves what
72:54 - Model S model 3 Model X model y that's
72:57 - what it has okay
72:59 - that's what it's got to make that happen
73:02 - let's go ahead and do this
73:05 - okay in the menu
73:07 - let's give it a P tag
73:10 - p-tech and inside that that will be an
73:12 - ATAC ref is equal to currently nothing

74:14 - awesome
74:15 - all right let's see what happens now
74:17 - okay there we go okay
74:19 - um so what happens here is you can see
74:22 - we have the a tag which kind of makes it
74:24 - you know has underline looking very much
74:26 - easily fix that by going inside the
74:28 - index.css
74:31 - boom let's keep the a tank so let's
74:33 - target all a tag
74:35 - A-Tech and we'll do text transformation
74:38 - or text transform none
74:41 - what does that mean oh text equation not
74:43 - so text decoration
74:45 - because by default it's underlined
74:48 - where is it right here that's the
74:50 - default one but instead we'll just say
74:51 - what none
74:53 - so if I save that see it's gone
74:56 - nice beautiful
74:58 - all right next one is in the menu you
75:01 - see how they're kind of like one on one
75:03 - one on top of each other we can fix that
75:05 - also by using display Flex

75:13 - the following it's just a split flexion

75:51 - give it maybe some spacing I would say
75:52 - so as well
75:54 - uh and to do that let's go ahead and
75:56 - Target the actual uh
75:59 - uh let's see uh P within this here

76:32 - that now workout types decoration text
76:35 - transform actually text Transformer bet
76:37 - transform
76:39 - there we go Model S models three
76:41 - beautiful nice
76:44 - and then let's go ahead and give some
76:46 - padding so for every single Pita I will
76:48 - give a padding so padding
76:50 - padding is going to be zero
76:54 - 10 pixels zero this in this case means
76:56 - top and bottom so basically top about a
76:58 - zero left and right is 10 pixels that's
77:01 - what that means
77:02 - oh my Daisy
77:05 - right there see
77:07 - oh let's also do flags for app Flex
77:10 - um
77:11 - rap let's do no rap
77:16 - all right to make sure there's not
77:18 - wrapped because I like the fact that
77:19 - it's wrapping like you know and so forth
77:22 - um I think it's just no rap like this I
77:23 - feel like that
77:26 - ah Maybe I'm Wrong anyways so here's
77:29 - what we got so far which is pretty good
77:30 - all right
77:32 - um a few different things I want us to
77:34 - focus on as well
77:38 - what we're going to do is we're going to
77:40 - make this menu basically a full width so
77:41 - Flex one so but given a flex one we're
77:44 - giving a full kind of weight
77:47 - Flex one and then if I say something
77:49 - like this for example if I say just the
77:50 - content Center check this out justify
77:52 - content
77:57 - boom no Justified content
78:04 - what happens here
78:06 - no nothing uh
78:09 - justify content align item Center
78:14 - let me see here container display Flex
78:17 - let me make sure it's all good
78:23 - why is it not doing so justify content
78:27 - Center that's one
78:31 - why is it not because here's the goal I
78:33 - wanted to also fully be the full width
78:36 - here so if I do inspect element let's
78:37 - see what happens Happening Here Right
78:39 - Now
78:39 - okay we have this all it's actually not
78:41 - the full width it's unfortunate
78:44 - it's actually because this is not the
78:46 - forward oh so you see this right here
78:48 - this is why inspectile is so important
78:50 - sometimes guys you see the full header
78:52 - is not the full width of the actual page
78:54 - now to make that happen it's pretty easy
78:55 - actually check this one out
78:58 - check this one out so to make that
78:59 - happen all we have to do is the
79:01 - following
79:04 - um is we give it right here so this
79:06 - container you see this container the
79:08 - header is I do the following I say top
79:11 - zero
79:12 - right that will stick it to the to the
79:14 - zero to the top okay that's love zero
79:17 - will stick it to the left
79:19 - okay now right zero it will stick it to
79:23 - the right meaning it will expand you see
79:26 - right there it says what happened it
79:27 - will expand the header with the full
79:29 - width
79:30 - after just happened you see that right
79:32 - there the header is the full width how
79:35 - cool is that right how cool is that
79:37 - so that's what just happened so now we
79:39 - have these specific models okay great
79:41 - the last the next thing you need to work
79:43 - on is going to be what well uh that's
79:46 - gonna be uh
79:48 - this shop Tesla account let's go ahead
79:50 - and make that one happen too so that's
79:52 - pretty easy as well and again some of
79:54 - this stuff is also going to be like
79:55 - we'll change it up later on to make sure
79:57 - it's actually like you know the menu is
79:59 - right so now we'll do the right menu
80:05 - all right menu
80:06 - right menu
80:08 - okay
80:10 - and inside the right menu there'll be a
80:12 - few different things we'll have first it
80:14 - will have a schref
80:17 - is equal to what I'm gonna go ahead and
80:19 - actually
80:20 - um
80:22 - I think this shouldn't be P I think we
80:24 - should remove this stuff I think there
80:25 - should be just a tags honestly
80:31 - that's something you hear same thing
80:33 - with this
80:34 - boom remove this just so we have an
80:36 - attack there's no reason to have all
80:37 - these P tags so it just will consistent
80:39 - throughout the whole thing okay and you
80:40 - can use command D to make sure it's all
80:42 - consistent okay
80:43 - so a schref and then it's gonna be in
80:46 - the same course and this will be a shop
80:50 - okay
80:52 - okay next one's gonna be a schref
80:56 - a
80:57 - Shroff is going to be equal to what
81:01 - is equal to
81:03 - href is equal to which one which is
81:06 - actually Tesla account so
81:08 - let's go ahead and do that we'll be uh
81:11 - Tesla
81:13 - account
81:15 - good good good and the last thing we
81:17 - need to do is we need an icon that's
81:19 - like a burger icon right here so we'll
81:21 - do that in a second here
81:23 - but first i'm going to focus on the
81:24 - right menu That's What I want to focus
81:26 - on for a second here okay
81:27 - so let's do right menu
81:29 - so save that of course we don't that
81:33 - does not not defined right now so that's
81:35 - not a problem whatsoever so we'll do
81:37 - menus this menu
81:39 - okay
81:41 - so we'll do a tag here instead of P make
81:44 - sure you're targeting a tag now at this
81:45 - point you see okay good
81:48 - all right let's go ahead and do const
81:50 - right
81:51 - menu is equal to what style dot div
81:56 - that's all it is
81:57 - okay
81:59 - um let's see here right menu is not
82:02 - defined yes it is you just need to
82:03 - refresh it
82:05 - there we go all right same thing we can
82:07 - do also the same thing on this one and
82:09 - also Target the actual individual what
82:11 - the individual a tags using something
82:13 - like this
82:16 - boom you see
82:20 - save it hey let's go beautiful all right
82:23 - so that's that's pretty good I kind of
82:26 - like that so let's find ways for 100
82:27 - text transform uppercase on the right
82:30 - menu padding let's go the only thing I
82:32 - will remove probably is going to be like
82:34 - the the padding
82:37 - and I'll set up to do margin margin
82:40 - right
82:42 - 10 pixels
82:44 - so now the shop that's a kind of more
82:46 - closer that's something I'll do at this
82:48 - point and then let's go ahead and remove
82:49 - this don't need this
82:51 - okay good I like that
82:53 - um the only thing it's pretty much we
82:55 - need to do is let's see let's see let's
82:57 - see it's going to be that the little uh
83:00 - hamburger menu that's what it's called
83:01 - so if I go to my Tesla account you see
83:04 - there's a hamburger menu we can fix that
83:06 - so we can actually make that work it's
83:07 - pretty cool check this one out
83:09 - to make this one work it's it kind of
83:12 - works like this
83:13 - um we're gonna use material UI so

88:14 - this is sick this is amazing
88:18 - so proud about one thing I want to
88:19 - change you see how this model actually
88:21 - gets squished well we're gonna make the
88:23 - change that you know whenever you get to
88:25 - a small screen you just remove it now to
88:27 - remove it again
88:29 - how do we do the last time we're also
88:31 - going to use a media query it's just how
88:33 - we did the last time right and with
88:35 - media queries it's pretty simple you
88:37 - just do like this
88:38 - try this out so on the menu group
88:41 - and the menu on the menu right here so
88:43 - we'll say what media
88:45 - again Max with RS 768 pixels meaning
88:49 - basically when we get to 768 pixels

88:55 - full thing so save that boom right there
88:57 - see
88:58 - oh let's go boom now What's Happening
89:01 - Here you see that shop Tesla account for
89:03 - some reason is doing this thing where
89:05 - it's like going all the way to the left
89:07 - hand side and we can fix that by what go
89:10 - into the container and currently we say
89:12 - align item Center but to make them space
89:16 - out we say justify content
89:20 - content and then we'll just space
89:21 - between that's it
89:25 - beat win
89:28 - there we go look at that oh oh oh oh
89:31 - yeah there we go so beautiful

89:54 - this page it has like this really slick
89:57 - animation
89:59 - and it's pretty cool I kind of like it
90:01 - you guys want to install the animation I
90:03 - think so too
90:04 - so how do we make this animation works
90:05 - it's gonna usually called react reveal
90:07 - check this out react
90:10 - reveal and all this is just a module
90:14 - it's basically just a module for react
90:17 - uh for animation Library you see
90:20 - look at this
90:23 - pretty much anything you want I mean we
90:25 - can even use different effects if you if
90:27 - you wanted to there's a zoom effect and
90:29 - so to create actually add a fade effect
90:31 - it's pretty simple you just you know you
90:34 - install react reveal like so right and
90:37 - then you do what then you do basically
90:40 - you add
90:41 - not zoom but you do see where's the fade
90:43 - I want to do Fade
90:45 - home fade fate fate fate fade effect
90:48 - there we go with their fade left you
90:50 - know you just give the Fate that's
90:51 - pretty much it that's it see that's all
90:53 - happens so let's go ahead and make that
90:55 - one work that's pretty cool
90:57 - um if I have my Model S here no matter
91:00 - why
91:01 - yeah that's cool all right so open up in
91:06 - terminal
91:09 - right here and let's do yarn add
91:12 - yarn
91:14 - add and what
91:17 - react reveal
91:19 - let's see one more time tutorials
91:21 - instructions react reveal right here
91:25 - react reveal so you want to add react
91:27 - reveal boom
91:28 - adding that to the react good good good
91:31 - beautiful
91:36 - nice okay
91:38 - all right now that that's happening
91:41 - oh it's gonna happen now at this point
91:42 - let's go back to our react reveal let's
91:44 - go into the fade effect
91:46 - we need to import the fade right here so
91:48 - import fade
91:50 - okay let's go and import fade here um
91:53 - this is the the let's go ahead this
91:55 - needs to be done on this section
91:56 - so import fade here
91:59 - two two two two
92:01 - boom and all we need to do is now just
92:04 - basically
92:05 - you know
92:06 - group the fade of what you wanted to
92:08 - fade it's as simple as that right so
92:10 - here's what I'll do on the item text I
92:12 - will say the following
92:14 - I will say fade
92:17 - where is it is it I will say here fade
92:22 - it I'm so faded fade bottom from the
92:25 - bottom

92:36 - oh how good is this check this one out
92:41 - guys all right I like that next let's go
92:44 - ahead and do around the bun group right
92:46 - here
92:47 - so do the following so we'll do Fade
92:50 - same thing also bottom
92:54 - boom
92:56 - Tata
92:59 - oh
93:01 - God oh yeah oh you oh so good so good so

93:24 - come here come on give me a break come
93:26 - on how good is this huh how good does
93:28 - this look I mean if you're not great I
93:31 - don't know what's going on with you
93:33 - you know so
93:37 - I'm getting very close Okay the next
93:39 - thing I want to start working on a work
93:40 - on is gonna be what is going to be the
93:42 - actual
93:43 - um
93:44 - kind of sidebar right so the sidebar
93:46 - that kind of comes up from here when I
93:48 - click on this we need to have a sidebar
93:50 - that comes up on the right hand side
93:51 - okay
93:52 - um so let's make that one happen
93:55 - sidebar is what's called a burger nav
93:57 - menu and for now let's go just let's go
94:00 - ahead and just create a program menu and
94:02 - that will be done so the hair.js right
94:04 - there
94:06 - so let's do this so Burger
94:10 - nav
94:12 - okay and this one will just have a bunch
94:16 - of like for example like items so here
94:18 - are the items that they should look like
94:19 - so we'll create a few items like this
94:21 - for example we'll say we'll use uh a
94:23 - Light Element so we'll say Li
94:26 - like this and we'll give an attack so
94:28 - we'll say a
94:30 - a schref is equal to nothing so far
94:34 - okay nothing so far but inside there for
94:37 - example we have things like existing
94:39 - inventory
94:41 - inventory right we also thinks that it's
94:44 - going to copy this right here so command
94:46 - C command V commit uh command V Command
94:49 - right uh we have a few different things
94:52 - that we're gonna say so invest in this
94:53 - inventory we have used inventory
94:55 - right so for example use inventory we
94:59 - have for example trade in
95:01 - right trade uh trade Dash in
95:07 - you know and so forth and so forth let's
95:09 - go ahead and maybe modify some of these
95:10 - right here maybe oh the Cyber truck
95:13 - who's excited for that one
95:15 - cyber
95:17 - truck right here
95:19 - there's maybe The Roaster that's gonna
95:21 - be pretty cool one too
95:25 - right there and so what we're building
95:27 - right now is pretty much the following
95:28 - right if we're building this menu
95:30 - boom this menu on the right hand side
95:32 - that's our building right there oh this
95:35 - one on the right hand side everything
95:36 - else will build now we just need to go
95:38 - and focus on that one okay
95:40 - uh you can see these were the model X
95:41 - use inventory that's just pretty much
95:43 - those items right there all right
95:44 - awesome sweet so we got that portion
95:46 - that's all good
95:48 - um and the burger nav of course not
95:50 - existing right now so we need to create
95:51 - that so let's say const const what const
95:57 - Burger nav
96:00 - Burger now is equal to what Burger nav
96:03 - is equal to
96:05 - style dot div
96:08 - Tata right there all right oh that looks
96:13 - hideous
96:14 - don't worry about it guys okay so don't
96:16 - worry about this so the Burger now right
96:19 - now uh let's go ahead and do the
96:21 - following we'll just put it on top of
96:22 - everything else that's that's kind of
96:24 - needed all right
96:26 - um so for one it's gonna be position
96:29 - fixed so position
96:33 - fixed why because it's always in the top
96:37 - no matter what
96:38 - right it's always going to be where on
96:40 - the right hand side right always going
96:42 - to be here no matter what page you're on
96:44 - okay
96:45 - so business fixed now where I'm going to
96:48 - say top zero right I'm going to say
96:50 - bottoms here to stretch it only the
96:52 - bottom
96:53 - and then I'm going to say write zero
96:57 - that will take it all the way to the
96:58 - right hand side
96:59 - boom okay so now it's on the right hand
97:02 - zero good next all right
97:05 - at this point let's go into background
97:06 - color
97:08 - back background
97:12 - white
97:14 - nice you see so it's kind of getting
97:16 - there a little bit all right so it's
97:18 - background white let's give it a width
97:21 - width of 300 pixels
97:24 - good
97:26 - nice okay I like it good good let's also
97:29 - give it a z index because obviously it's
97:30 - like kind of like I think it's kind of
97:32 - like
97:33 - the index so the Z index is like 10 100.
97:39 - [Music]
97:41 - let's see
97:42 - is it 100
97:43 - um I think it's because in that case we
97:46 - need to go ahead and make everything
97:47 - else is the index of smaller that's what
97:50 - we need to do in that case so that means
97:52 - that everything else oh man that's a lot
97:57 - gosh darn it okay so the whole section
97:59 - now
98:00 - let's do this let's go to section how
98:03 - and this right here will say Z index
98:09 - index of 10 let's just say
98:14 - will that change anything
98:16 - because I want this to be on top
98:19 - you see what I mean I want it to be on
98:21 - top is what I'm trying to get to
98:23 - let's think about it here
98:29 - the index 10 that's going to be maybe
98:32 - negative one
98:37 - negative one no that's not it the index
98:40 - of
98:41 - let's just say the index of 10
98:45 - . so what's what's being overwritten so
98:47 - let's see
98:50 - okay let's see let's see let's see let's
98:52 - see so ball for one is the item text so
98:54 - I think we need to focus on item text
98:56 - here so let's do
98:58 - item text let's do this one it's going
99:01 - to be Z index
99:03 - it's gonna be 10.
99:06 - come on give me something
99:11 - um
99:14 - so item tax C next minus one
99:21 - does that mean the home just had needs
99:22 - to have a smaller Z index I'm just
99:24 - trying to think here guys what do you
99:24 - guys think here so home maybe this is
99:27 - going to be easy index of 10 maybe
99:32 - no
99:33 - did not change nothing okay let's see
99:37 - how do we go ahead and make sure that
99:38 - this kind of works the way I wanted to
99:40 - so Z index of 10 what do you guys think
99:41 - have any suggestions
99:43 - and we have any suggestions
99:46 - some said refresh
99:48 - no
99:51 - home 10 it's Max but do 10 for sidebar
99:55 - okay so for sidebar let's try that for
99:57 - the header for the whole Burger nav
100:01 - let's try that
100:03 - I mean I can't do anything like
100:08 - let's see still not nothing
100:23 - [Music]
100:25 - how do we fix the Z index issue
100:30 - the index of let's try this the Innes of
100:33 - 16.
100:36 - I'm just thinking here let's see easy
100:38 - index
100:44 - oh maybe it's this so it contains really
100:47 - let's see if I go to here and I say this
100:50 - container is z index of one
100:55 - oh what the heck
100:58 - oh that makes sense
101:02 - oh so we actually so it was competing
101:06 - the weight was competing not with
101:08 - everything else it was actually
101:10 - competing with the actual header which
101:13 - is the container which is above it
101:15 - because this remember this broken app is
101:17 - within this so in order to have this
101:20 - show up above this the container I'm
101:23 - going to give this a small Z index and
101:25 - give this one a z next like 16 they say
101:27 - okay that makes sense okay so there we
101:29 - go all right so cool we kind of got that
101:31 - that's pretty awesome
101:33 - I kind of like that won't you agree okay
101:36 - so now let's go ahead and focus on
101:40 - we have the index
101:44 - okay let's do the burger now and
101:47 - top zero width that's good that's good
101:49 - now okay let's go and remove this list
101:52 - out because it's horrible Let's test
101:54 - Style
101:55 - it'll be none
101:57 - okay good
101:59 - next
102:02 - let's do padding 20 pixels
102:06 - to give it some padding all around
102:09 - good
102:10 - nice nice nice nice nice nice
102:16 - okay
102:17 - 20 pixels then let's go ahead and do the
102:20 - following then we'll do a background no
102:24 - no no
102:26 - so the list style is kind of like not
102:28 - the way I wanted to because
102:30 - why because it's centered which is not
102:33 - what I like so to make that work I just
102:36 - do display Flex on this one
102:39 - this place of display Flex on this puppy
102:41 - there you go
102:43 - good and then we'll do fly version
102:44 - column
102:50 - good
102:52 - ah it's still okay don't worry and then
102:55 - uh we'll do what to flex
102:58 - um
102:59 - justify content
103:01 - justify content
103:05 - a flex
103:08 - start
103:09 - good oh like this
103:13 - let's justify content like really come
103:16 - on
103:17 - really nothing is a text online
103:21 - text align
103:24 - what
103:25 - start
103:27 - okay never mind you don't need this
103:29 - livestretation column that case
103:31 - I mean that could still be useful
103:33 - actually oh we don't need this one
103:36 - so attacks the line start which is good
103:38 - which I like okay uh let's see where are
103:40 - we at so on this one we have model three
103:43 - Model S okay I like that so now let's go
103:46 - ahead and focus on each line so Li
103:50 - okay so a lie on this one we'll do the
103:54 - following and this all I will do
103:57 - so we'll have padding top and bottom
103:59 - padding 15 pixels for every single one
104:01 - and then left and right is gonna be zero
104:03 - for now
104:04 - okay and we'll give it a border bottom
104:09 - boom right there good
104:12 - okay good and then we'll give it an a
104:14 - tag so on the let's go ahead and see
104:18 - let's see now oh let's go that looks
104:21 - good that looks good okay I like it I
104:23 - like it I like it let's go ahead and
104:25 - give it and the e-tag let's just give it
104:28 - a more of a font weight so we'll do font
104:31 - weight
104:32 - wait
104:35 - font weight
104:37 - by the way we're almost at a thousand
104:39 - likes guys come on let's get this party
104:42 - started fund weight 600 good
104:46 - a let's go now of course now the thing
104:49 - we need to work on is how do you
104:51 - actually make it work so that it
104:52 - actually shows up properly you know what
104:53 - I mean because right now
104:54 - it's just kind of there right so right
104:56 - now it's just kind of there
104:58 - um yeah it's top right bottom zero you
105:01 - know and we just hide it somehow so how
105:03 - do we hide it well for one let's go
105:05 - ahead and add an x button so in a
105:07 - material UI icons
105:10 - let's go and find material icons let's
105:12 - do material
105:15 - UI icons
105:17 - material
105:21 - and let's find an x button
105:26 - X
105:31 - there we go close okay good exactly what
105:35 - we want So Close icon
105:37 - all right
105:40 - like oh look how good this look guys oh
105:43 - my God it's so good okay let's go ahead
105:45 - and input our close button here
105:48 - okay
105:49 - so inside the burger nav we'll create
105:51 - we'll actually go ahead and do this
105:52 - close button right here oops oops so
105:56 - we'll do
105:58 - um
105:59 - we'll do what Custom Clothes so we'll
106:02 - say this custom close custom close so
106:04 - it's going to create a custom close
106:06 - button and how we're gonna do that well
106:07 - by using stock components so let's go
106:10 - here
106:12 - const custom
106:15 - close is equal to what styled
106:20 - no
106:23 - start what
106:26 - you see style close icon
106:31 - right there
106:34 - [Music]
106:36 - there we go close icon
106:48 - nice okay good good I like it okay uh
106:51 - allowed me to actually make sure this
106:53 - one gets aligned not there but actually
106:56 - somewhere else so to do this one we'll
106:59 - do let's see let's see let's see just
107:01 - kind of thinking here and this one
107:04 - um
107:05 - we need to wrap it in that case so let's
107:07 - do
107:09 - we'll create a closed wrapper
107:11 - clothes wrapper
107:15 - because we need to actually shift this
107:17 - to the right hand side right so if I go
107:18 - ahead and do it this way
107:20 - so again this is Bishop to here right we
107:22 - need to put that here in order to shift
107:24 - that properly how is it going to work
107:26 - well to shift it properly right I'm
107:29 - going to create a div around it a
107:30 - wrapper and then display Flex it and put
107:33 - it here that's I'm going to create it
107:35 - okay just so you know and that's a
107:36 - pretty good way of doing this kind of
107:37 - stuff right
107:38 - so just so you know custom close
107:41 - okay so if you want to like align
107:43 - something remember this rule wrap it if
107:47 - you want to align something wrap it you
107:49 - need to there's always needs to be a
107:50 - parent wrapper in order to align
107:52 - something vertically horizontally left
107:54 - right whatever it might have to be right
107:57 - okay close wrapper let's go ahead and
107:59 - create that color wrap right here
108:02 - okay so close wrapper so const
108:05 - close
108:07 - wrapper
108:08 - is equal to styled dot div
108:12 - now look at this one now you see check
108:14 - this one out okay all I do at this point
108:17 - is very simple I say the following I say
108:19 - display Flex
108:22 - flex and here's what I do
108:26 - check this one out okay let's play flex
108:28 - and we'll say
108:30 - um
108:31 - justify content
108:36 - content what Flex end
108:41 - boom right there see
108:43 - just as simple as that that's it and now
108:45 - that's there okay next up let's go ahead
108:47 - and do the following we'll do
108:49 - um let's do on the actual custom close
108:51 - we'll do what cursor pointer
108:56 - pointer save that nice
109:00 - right there there we go beautiful
109:01 - beautiful good good good good good good
109:06 - awesome sweet look at this oh my gosh
109:10 - this looks good guys this looks so good
109:12 - all right who's still with me you guys
109:14 - still with me I hope so let's go
109:17 - all right all right so we got this
109:19 - portion now we need to figure out how do
109:21 - we close it well we're going to use use
109:22 - state to make sure that we understand
109:24 - when is there when there is a closing
109:26 - factor or when there's an open Factor
109:28 - right so
109:30 - for example
109:33 - [Music]
109:34 - um
109:35 - let's go and do this let's use your
109:37 - state to figure out when I click on this
109:40 - I'm going to trigger a you state to say
109:43 - Hey you know close it right
109:46 - if I open it I'm going to say that we
109:48 - have an open State now that's what's
109:50 - going to happen now okay
109:51 - so let's do this
109:53 - I'm going to say you stay it's going to
109:54 - open import you state here
109:58 - you state beautiful okay
110:02 - all right nice nice nice nice and at
110:05 - this point you as few a few very simple
110:06 - things okay
110:08 - this is so clean guys by the way such
110:10 - such a such clean code which I really
110:12 - love by the way all right so we have you
110:14 - state and the side here is the following
110:17 - boom and we'll do const here I'm going
110:20 - to create our use state so we'll say
110:22 - Burger uh status of a burger
110:25 - I'll say open
110:28 - Burger open
110:30 - or set
110:34 - I'll just say Burger status I think it's
110:36 - good I kind of like that one
110:38 - status right there and with a sad Burger
110:42 - status a burger
110:44 - Stat or this right there it's equal to
110:47 - what use
110:48 - State and this will set it to false
110:51 - so we're now right now it's actually
110:53 - closed
110:54 - so story status is closed
110:56 - but there right so that's what's gonna
110:58 - happen Okay so recess is closed now
111:01 - how do you go ahead and make sure that
111:03 - you know that this stuff is actually
111:05 - closed or open well very simple is
111:09 - what we can do is the following so look
111:11 - at this on the burger nav I'm going to
111:12 - pass an error wrapper here I'll pass in
111:14 - a parameter here and this can be show is
111:16 - equal to the status of the burger status
111:18 - say Burger status
111:20 - Burger status right there
111:24 - I guess that is inside the burger now
111:27 - Burger now all I'm going to do is
111:30 - check this one out
111:33 - I'm going to say for example here
111:37 - um
111:39 - if we have so look at this one
111:41 - I'm going to transform it so I'm going
111:43 - to say transform
111:46 - check this one out transform
111:48 - okay
111:49 - I'm going to look at the props or props
111:51 - like so
111:53 - what about this I've done before and
111:55 - basically here's what we'll say if
111:58 - if it says prop star show
112:02 - perhaps.show
112:04 - right it basically says perhaps a show
112:06 - we're going to do what
112:09 - transform you know nothing so here's
112:12 - what we'll do we'll do even says
112:14 - props.show we'll just make it you know
112:17 - show basically
112:19 - um translate x0 so here's what we'll do
112:21 - so Translate
112:24 - translate X
112:26 - it would need to be like this right here
112:30 - translate X
112:32 - 0. and what does that do so if I go to
112:35 - translate X
112:36 - go ahead and do it this way
112:39 - otherwise
112:41 - we'll do translate x 100 percent
112:44 - Translate
112:47 - X
112:49 - 100 percent
112:50 - okay okay
112:52 - let's see so right now it's false okay
112:56 - oh now it's false Okay so
112:59 - what just happened let me see and make
113:01 - sure it's all good let me see I think I
113:03 - need to actually
113:06 - hey let's go so now now look you see so
113:10 - right now translate X basically if it's
113:12 - show we have translate x0 so translate x
113:14 - what does that what does that pretty
113:16 - much do
113:17 - um Let Me Go and show it to you
113:20 - Tran this is late X
113:25 - right here
113:27 - look at this one guys this is pretty
113:29 - cool right
113:31 - so I can move something basically
113:36 - so right here for example I can
113:38 - translate x 10 pixels I'm gonna
113:40 - translate 10 pixels to the right hand
113:41 - side
113:42 - right and so
113:45 - what's going to happen is
113:48 - is the following
113:55 - if I go ahead and actually
113:58 - if I do for example if I do show and I
114:00 - say here a hundred percent
114:04 - boom let's go and see this see this see
114:09 - this
114:11 - prop Style Show isn't working at all
114:13 - let's see am I missing something
114:16 - um probably show should be false if it's
114:19 - false I think it should be translate
114:20 - zero yes yes yes yes yes
114:23 - there you go so let's get this out
114:26 - so this will do if props that show
114:28 - basically you could not proper show is
114:30 - false right now of course
114:31 - so what's going to happen is it's going
114:32 - to translate what zero it won't move it
114:35 - at all right
114:37 - right so that's gonna happen if it's
114:39 - false it won't move it at all that's
114:42 - that's that's that's kind of what
114:43 - happened of course but we need to say
114:45 - this if it's false what happens actually
114:47 - if it's true if it's if we say
114:48 - props.show right
114:51 - then we actually need to move it not
114:53 - nothing because basically we do nothing
114:55 - right so if it's true we don't do
114:57 - nothing to this right this stays the way
114:59 - you should be
115:01 - right but the second is false
115:04 - this is false we need to move to the
115:07 - right hand side it's full width right
115:10 - here see that's why he shows it that way
115:11 - now check this out
115:13 - what we can do now at this point is we
115:16 - can have another click so when I go
115:18 - ahead and I click open so this com
115:20 - unclick button so unclick unclick is
115:23 - equal to what
115:25 - right I'm gonna say uh
115:30 - right well I'm gonna say what I'm going
115:33 - to do the following
115:35 - I'm gonna say sadbroker status
115:38 - to true
115:41 - that is too true
115:44 - so set it to true
115:46 - okay
115:47 - true so means if I click on this on you
115:49 - icon set the progress status to be true
115:51 - minions mini open so let's try this for
115:53 - now oh look at that see that means open
115:57 - right there
115:58 - how cool is that so that means open okay
116:00 - now close is now work right now because
116:01 - of course close is nothing right so now
116:03 - to actually change that to make that
116:04 - fully happen what to do on the on the
116:08 - click of this one
116:10 - what we're going to say is equal to
116:14 - what
116:15 - boom boom will say what
116:18 - status
116:22 - what cyberger status to what
116:25 - to
116:28 - false there we go look at this now right

117:20 - this out you see this transform
117:22 - all I do is look
117:25 - transition I say the following
117:26 - transition
117:29 - transition
117:31 - and I do what on the transform Factor
117:37 - Traditions form and I will say what 0.2
117:40 - seconds
117:42 - and I'm going to say ease in
117:44 - right
117:46 - now your wife it is my friend are you
117:48 - ready for the reveal
117:52 - all right oh
117:56 - foreign
117:57 - look at that boom boom boom boom boom
118:02 - I kind of want to make it even better
118:04 - though I kind of want to make it look
118:05 - even better let me see
118:07 - let's see I want to say ease in ease out
118:11 - I wouldn't say easing ease dash out
118:16 - I don't like that better
118:18 - knock here
118:20 - oh that's not it hold on um
118:24 - let's see
118:28 - there we go much better I like
118:31 - oh let's go that looks so good how cool
118:35 - is that guys let's go ahead and give us
118:38 - a thumbs up for the following and we're
118:41 - at a thousand likes you guys are amazing
118:44 - as always just want to say
118:46 - something easy now thank you
118:48 - hey let's go oh
118:54 - how cool is that
118:57 - beautiful it looks so good
119:02 - okay now let's go ahead and actually add
119:04 - something to this right we're gonna add
119:06 - some Redux to this all right but pretty
119:07 - much look at this we're almost pretty
119:09 - much done we're so close to finishing
119:10 - this a Tesla clone uh it's so clean the
119:13 - coat is clean that's the really cool
119:15 - part about this all right
119:17 - um a few things now we're going to do is
119:19 - the following let's go ahead and add
119:22 - some data to it about like our cars
119:24 - right so as you can see here
119:26 - we have for example you know we might
119:28 - have cars for example car titles so here
119:30 - for example Model S and so forth right
119:32 - Model S model 3 Model Model Y and and so
119:36 - forth now
119:37 - let's go ahead and create uh our Redux
119:40 - store that will contain the cars that we
119:43 - will be using here okay we'll be using
119:45 - here so here's what we'll do
119:48 - let's go ahead and look at the Redix the
119:50 - component that we need to create so
119:51 - let's go features and the one that we
119:53 - have currently is like a weird one
119:55 - that's like a counter feature we don't
119:56 - need that one at all so we can actually
119:58 - fix that one but that's the hand side we
120:01 - can't fix that one um don't need the
120:03 - counter instead of go ahead and create
120:04 - new folder on the features folder
120:07 - and let's call it for example car slice
120:11 - car slice right there okay counter you
120:15 - can remove that one so let's go ahead
120:16 - right click
120:18 - um delete
120:21 - move to trash
120:23 - now we only just have car slice because
120:25 - that's the only thing we need so inside
120:26 - the car so it's gonna create a new file
120:27 - and
120:30 - what
120:31 - actually no Let's do let's see uh let's
120:34 - rename this to car
120:37 - rename this to car not car slice car and
120:40 - inside here we'll create new file called
120:42 - car slice car
120:44 - slice.js
120:46 - beautiful okay all right let's go to our
120:49 - app go to store and I've removed this
120:51 - counter reducer because we don't need
120:52 - that one okay
120:53 - okay good
120:55 - on the counter slice
120:58 - on the car slice
121:00 - all right we need to of course import
121:01 - Redux toolkit so let's go ahead and read
121:04 - the import Redux toolkit for create
121:07 - slice and what slice is basically in
121:10 - Redux is Imagine remix is like this
121:12 - whole state of data that you have right
121:14 - imagine Redux is like for example you
121:16 - know where this is this whole state
121:18 - right and a slice is just one smaller
121:20 - state right one small one piece of a
121:22 - state so in our case our slice will be
121:25 - for example just car for now and that's
121:26 - why it's called slices right it's like a
121:29 - slight slice of pizza right and every
121:31 - single for example when you're trying to
121:33 - save data in the global state of the
121:35 - whole website right you might have a car
121:37 - slice you might have an inventory slice
121:39 - who know for example right inventory you
121:41 - know and so forth and so forth and all
121:43 - that is just data shared across all your
121:46 - web pages websites all your pages on
121:49 - your site that's pretty much it okay so
121:52 - let me create a slice that's what's
121:53 - Happening Here
121:54 - all right beautiful
121:56 - let's go ahead and go next the next one
121:58 - we'll go ahead and do is we've got the
122:00 - car sliced that's great
122:02 - um
122:03 - let's
122:05 - create the initial state so we'll do
122:06 - const initial
122:09 - State and we'll give it a few cards so
122:11 - we'll say
122:13 - um cars
122:17 - I'm giving the cars right here
122:19 - and this will be actually an array of
122:22 - objects X just actually just honestly
122:24 - just an array of cards so say for
122:26 - example model which one
122:29 - what do we have Model S model 3 right
122:35 - Model S model 3 Model X model y so Model
122:38 - S
122:40 - Model S
122:42 - model three
122:45 - okay
122:46 - Model X
122:50 - Model X
122:52 - and then model y
122:56 - oh
122:58 - model y there we go
123:01 - all right so we got ourselves the cars
123:05 - okay
123:07 - um let's go ahead and now get this car
123:09 - so to create the actual slice we'll do
123:12 - const
123:14 - car slice
123:17 - car slice
123:19 - is equal to what's going to create the
123:20 - slides right we're creating a slice of
123:22 - pizza right create slice
123:24 - right there and that takes a few
123:26 - different things the amount we're going
123:27 - to name it as name the slice right there
123:29 - this could be car for now
123:31 - okay and then we'll give an initial
123:34 - state
123:36 - and
123:37 - initial
123:39 - state right there okay and then we'll
123:41 - give a few reduces now we don't need any
123:43 - reduces at this point right because our
123:44 - goal right now is just to get the cars
123:46 - that's it so we don't need anything like
123:48 - that of that sort that's way too
123:49 - complicated
123:50 - instead but instead will what we will
123:52 - however do is we'll get the cards
123:54 - themselves so we'll say export const
123:57 - and the trajectory or how usually you do
124:01 - it inside slices inside windows toolkit
124:03 - is you for example do select so it's
124:05 - like selecting a piece of object
124:07 - selecting a piece of data so in that
124:09 - case I'm selecting cars right here okay
124:12 - is equal to what is equal to state
124:16 - it's a good State and then it's gonna
124:18 - return to me
124:20 - let's turn to be the state
124:23 - that car the car is the name of the
124:25 - slides right here dot cars that's it and
124:29 - that's going to be this right here
124:29 - that's with this whole array that's
124:31 - pretty much it okay so this right here
124:33 - is mapping directly to this right here
124:37 - and Select Cars will have that for us
124:39 - that's it
124:40 - and of course we're going to export now
124:43 - default
124:46 - uh we could ask for the reducer because
124:48 - we need to actually export some kind of
124:50 - reducer even though it's empty default
124:52 - and we'll say car slice
124:54 - dot reducer
124:58 - beautiful nice all right once we've got
125:00 - that we need to actually import this so
125:02 - let's go ahead and go to store and we'll
125:05 - do import
125:10 - and this will be the car reducer so
125:12 - we'll say car
125:14 - car reducer
125:16 - right here
125:17 - from what
125:19 - okay when you go back then we need to go
125:22 - into features let me go ahead let me see
125:24 - this I need to go back let me go into
125:26 - features right here after that we need
125:29 - to go into the car right there
125:31 - car let me go car slice beautiful right
125:35 - there and so inside of this kind of
125:37 - reducer we just change it to car reducer
125:39 - car is going to be car reducer right
125:41 - there right
125:42 - so that's pretty much all you have to do
125:45 - on the Redux reducer side okay so just
125:47 - keep that in mind always okay guys uh
125:50 - you know the store you you tell what
125:52 - producers you have okay the slice is
125:55 - basically every individual reducer you
125:57 - can see right individual slice and this
125:58 - contains the actions and I'm not gonna
126:00 - go into go deep into redex of course
126:02 - that there will be another video of
126:04 - itself
126:05 - um but
126:07 - it Redux there's always a few different
126:08 - things we also have we always have the
126:10 - initial State that's a state that you
126:12 - will have when you initially start the
126:13 - application and you will have reducers
126:15 - and reduce strategies just functions you
126:17 - can use to manipulate the state
126:19 - maybe you have a function that will add
126:21 - a new car you know or something
126:23 - something else so that's what kind of
126:25 - the Redux reducer is there for right
126:27 - there's also actions but we'll talk
126:30 - about those later most important thing
126:32 - is the fact that we have Select Cars
126:34 - which will get us the cars individually
126:36 - okay nice okay so all right at this
126:40 - point we are pretty much almost done
126:42 - let's go to home.js and what we need to
126:45 - do is the following
126:47 - it's got a section here section here uh
126:50 - no actually not here
126:55 - header right here
126:56 - we're going to import our
126:59 - car slice so so let's go import
127:04 - okay I will say Select Cars right this
127:06 - will get us the actual car select
127:08 - cars
127:11 - from
127:13 - from what
127:14 - from
127:17 - features right here slash car slash car
127:22 - slice good
127:24 - and we need to actually import your
127:26 - selector so in order to select something
127:28 - that usually something called use
127:29 - selector which is a hook which is a
127:31 - react hook right here
127:33 - oh God
127:35 - right here
127:36 - so you selector and then we're going to
127:38 - select the actual card so we'll say
127:40 - const cars
127:42 - is equal to what use selector
127:46 - from what
127:48 - well Select Cars
127:51 - boom done you see that's it right we've
127:54 - started the cars from the actual you
127:56 - selector right so if we're in a consult
127:58 - login let's go to consult a load the
127:59 - cars
128:03 - cars okay
128:05 - console login right now let's go ahead
128:07 - and right click inspect them on this one
128:10 - console
128:12 - uh
128:16 - let's go ahead and see how this works
128:19 - out let's go ahead and refresh it
128:21 - says Legacy Collins API has been
128:24 - detected within the strict mode tree
128:25 - don't worry about this one but look at
128:27 - this here it is Model S model 3 Model X
128:30 - model y beautiful that's all we need to
128:31 - Do's I see this is some fade stuff we
128:34 - don't need to do this one should
128:36 - mitigate to the new version the old API
128:37 - will be 24 that's fine right so right
128:40 - there here's our array and now all we do
128:43 - is for example for this which so now
128:46 - here as we'll do if cars
128:50 - cars and
128:53 - and cars dot map
128:58 - right
129:00 - gonna get the individual car
129:04 - and then we're gonna get the index
129:10 - boom done
129:12 - all right
129:14 - and took automatic index and then that's
129:17 - going to give us what
129:23 - okay good so then I will go ahead and do
129:26 - a Shroff
129:29 - Doom
129:31 - right here
129:33 - I will give it some kind of a thing like
129:36 - this
129:39 - okay
129:40 - that closes that beautiful there we go
129:43 - so Model S okay now check this out all
129:45 - we gotta do now at this point is just be
129:47 - give it a car
129:51 - oops car
129:53 - and I can remove this now
129:56 - done
129:58 - so now let's see
130:01 - oh let's go another thing we want to
130:05 - figure out is give the key so because if
130:08 - I right click the Spectrum on this one
130:10 - go to console here see it says each
130:13 - child in the list should have a unique
130:14 - key the reason why they do that is
130:15 - because
130:16 - um react actually tracks individual
130:19 - Child by the key so let's say any
130:21 - changes happened it will not work to
130:23 - make those changes I'm curious about
130:24 - using the index like this
130:27 - right there see
130:29 - so if I inspect them by now
130:31 - okay the console and let's go ahead I
130:34 - refresh this again
130:35 - see the child is no longer that issue is
130:38 - no longer there beautiful let's remove
130:40 - this console of cars guys we're almost
130:42 - done so close to being done and
130:45 - finishing up this Tesla clone that is
130:49 - pretty pretty insane I will say all
130:51 - right and the next thing I'm going to do
130:52 - is we'll do the same thing with this
130:54 - specific situation here with this cars
130:57 - and I'll put in here
131:00 - cars are map but in my case I'm going to
131:02 - use it like this
131:05 - boom
131:06 - and this will be the actual car itself
131:09 - car right there and again a lie and I'm
131:12 - going to give it a key is equal to the
131:14 - actual index
131:16 - boom boom boom boom boom
131:19 - don't need any of this stuff
131:22 - boom right here that's it that's it and
131:25 - so this is gonna be that let's go ahead
131:27 - and take a look at that one so cars.map
131:29 - so let's go see
131:32 - oh oh would you look at that oh
131:36 - guys look at what we have got for
131:40 - ourselves let's go ahead and do add
131:43 - and that's gonna be uh Redux for cars
131:47 - right there
131:49 - good yes good
131:51 - be a look at what we have got for
131:56 - ourselves oh my God look at that guys
132:00 - look at this Model S model three we have
132:04 - some beautiful animations look at that
132:06 - oh my God
132:09 - accessories all this stuff and if you
132:12 - compare it to an actual Tesla page I
132:14 - mean let's go ahead and take a look at
132:15 - the Tesla page actual Tesla page
132:18 - let's take a look at it here look at
132:21 - that like what like okay just compare it
132:24 - here
132:25 - like hold on look look like what guys do
132:30 - you see the magic that we have just done
132:35 - like can you tell the difference I mean
132:37 - yes we have this fancy feature like the
132:39 - scrolling feature we can work on that
132:40 - later but look
132:43 - it's there
132:45 - I actually hate I actually hate this
132:46 - kind of um features of like where they
132:49 - you know they don't allow you to scroll
132:51 - I hate that oh let's go look at oh my
132:55 - God how good is this guys this is So
133:00 - Fresh So Clean You Know It uh guys that

135:18 - set it right there that's all you gotta
135:19 - do okay that's pretty much it guys and
135:22 - look at this by the way I don't know if

137:36 - making this full screen this is a
137:39 - beautiful uh that we we're going to
137:41 - build we're going to use Firebase we're
137:42 - going to use Redux we're going to use
137:45 - reactor Dom we're going to use let me
137:47 - see what else are we going to use we're
137:49 - going to use things like you know a
137:51 - react slick to be able to create this
137:53 - slick animation right here right uh so
137:56 - many different things we're going to use
137:57 - style components all is going to be used
137:59 - here okay
138:00 - and of course we're gonna be using vs
138:02 - code for to be able to build this look
138:04 - at all these animations if I go ahead
138:07 - and click on this I can sign out
138:08 - beautiful and then I can click login to
138:11 - log in again with my this is by the way
138:13 - using Firebase authentication so I can
138:15 - log in like this but oh we're set we're
138:19 - set hello YouTube Hello everybody I hope
138:22 - you guys are doing great all right so
138:23 - let's go actually get this party started
138:26 - let's get it straight into it
138:28 - um so a few things we need to do to go
138:30 - ahead and get the start like I said this
138:32 - is going to be a very detailed build we
138:34 - might split this up into two parts but
138:36 - this is how we're going to do it all
138:38 - right beautiful all right okay so now at
138:41 - this point what we need to do is the
138:43 - first things first is let's go ahead and
138:45 - build out our actual project by starting
138:47 - up a you know project using react so the
138:50 - opportunity to do of course for this you
138:52 - need a node.js so the first thing you
138:53 - need to do is you need to install
138:54 - node.js hopefully you have that by now
138:57 - so node.js right here
138:59 - very very important right that's gonna
139:01 - be what you need that's node.js all
139:03 - right so make sure you install the
139:04 - recommended version okay once you've got
139:06 - that of course you need to install
139:08 - pretty much this we use code and once
139:10 - you're done with that you're pretty much
139:11 - all set okay
139:12 - all right sweet sweet so let's go ahead
139:15 - and open up our finder or uh something
139:17 - where we go ahead and actually open up a
139:19 - folder I'm gonna go ahead new finder
139:21 - here new finder uh
139:24 - new finder window
139:25 - hopefully I can find it here where's my
139:28 - viewfinder window right there all right
139:30 - and now we'll go have a GitHub folder
139:32 - here right here and this is called Nas
139:34 - and I'm going to do new Services New
139:36 - terminal at folder so I'm going to open
139:38 - up a new terminal folder if you're in
139:40 - Windows you might have to do it
139:41 - differently you might have to use your
139:42 - terminal kind of like on windows so what
139:46 - I will do on this point is I will say
139:47 - type in MPX create
139:50 - create I'm gonna go ahead and make this
139:52 - a little bit bigger so you can you can
139:53 - all see it npx
139:56 - npx create
139:59 - dash dash react
140:02 - react Dash app dash dash template
140:07 - Redux right so we're going to use Redux
140:10 - for this specific application note so
140:11 - npx create react app dash dash template
140:15 - Redux is what you need to do so click
140:17 - enter on this one
140:21 - to see all options please specify the
140:23 - project I need to okay so the issue is
140:26 - are you specify the project name here so
140:28 - NPS queer react app and we're going to
140:30 - call it Disney Disney Plus
140:33 - Dash clone right here so npx career
140:37 - react app Disney plus clone dash dash
140:39 - template Redux hit enter all right
140:42 - that's all going doing so what's
140:43 - happening here is very simple guys okay
140:45 - what's going on is basically it's
140:47 - building all the scripts it's building
140:49 - it's initializing a the first project
140:51 - for us uh in order to be able to do
140:53 - something like this and of course hello
140:55 - YouTube Hello everybody I see all of you
140:57 - guys well we have a 20 donation from on

141:24 - actually joined our boot camp and he was
141:26 - able to make a lot of a basically a
141:29 - Sunday key job and then make up more
141:31 - money from other jobs as well so pretty
141:32 - pretty insane
141:34 - all right now at this point that's
141:36 - that's it so what we've done here is
141:38 - we've created our project it was happy
141:40 - hacking once it says happy hacking
141:42 - you're pretty much done okay I'm gonna
141:44 - put up some music here so we can all be
141:46 - listening to a little bit of music while
141:47 - we're coding all right so happy hacking
141:50 - beautiful all right at this point what
141:53 - we need to do is you see how it created
141:54 - this folder called Disney plus clone
141:56 - right here and all we need to do is very
141:59 - simple we need to go ahead and open this
142:01 - up and we use code all right so let me
142:03 - put this use code on here on the right
142:05 - hand side and of course hopefully you
142:07 - can do this by your with by yourself as
142:09 - well
142:10 - that that
142:11 - all right I'm gonna open up a new new
142:15 - window with vs code there we go
142:17 - beautiful that's the new window just
142:20 - opened up I will do file open
142:23 - and then go to my ticket hub go to NAS
142:26 - here and then the one that we just did
142:28 - is what the Disney plus clone that's the
142:30 - one that we just opened up so let's go
142:31 - ahead and do that right now beautiful
142:32 - all right sweet all right and here's
142:35 - what we got now so right this is the
142:37 - project that we start out with with or
142:39 - basically react GS you can see we have
142:41 - source and there's a few files that you
142:43 - need to pay attention to the the one
142:45 - file that you need to really really pay
142:46 - attention to is kind of like uh well
142:49 - this one right here is we have app.js
142:51 - that's kind of like your main file right
142:53 - here and what we can do is if we do go
142:55 - ahead and do let's do right click on the
142:58 - yarn.lock and then say open inside
143:00 - integrate terminal right here and then
143:03 - do npm npm start boom
143:07 - npm starts to click npm Start beautiful
143:09 - that will start up your project guys
143:12 - okay
143:13 - that will set up your project and now at
143:15 - this point you should see it right here
143:17 - oh let's go this is our first react JS
143:22 - project reactor JS project okay of
143:27 - course you can click you can hit plus
143:28 - right here to add add it you can hit
143:30 - minus and the way it's working it's
143:33 - working with Redux is because we're able
143:35 - to for example click plus and minus with
143:37 - Redux right and Redux is a way to roster
143:40 - Save State and we'll talk about how
143:42 - that's done later on a little bit okay
143:44 - so subtract number three two one Z and
143:47 - so forth that's pretty awesome all right
143:49 - so this is our first project right here
143:51 - and what we need to do is very simple at
143:52 - this point is let's do some cleanup okay
143:54 - that's part one
143:56 - all right in terms of cleanup let me go
143:58 - ahead and make this right here uh at
144:00 - that JS don't really need anything here
144:02 - now just remove that
144:04 - sign out of baby let's go that's done
144:06 - all right save that that's what I'm
144:08 - talking about all right okay that's what
144:12 - I'm talking about so we don't need that
144:14 - all right so now it's clean right and I
144:16 - can type with whatever whatever I want
144:17 - in here so I'll say hello
144:19 - boom right if I say hello okay so really
144:22 - just anything I kind of want all right
144:24 - A5 for example look at these other
144:26 - things uh we have 300 views 300 people
144:29 - on YouTube Hold up what's up what's up
144:31 - what's up amazing to have all of you
144:32 - guys here as always as always okay
144:35 - beautiful hello hello hello great travel
144:38 - creation always helps me somebody
144:39 - somebody said
144:40 - all right so that's if I say hello here
144:43 - you can see we have hello on here next
144:44 - up let's go and clean up some CSS here
144:47 - um at that CSS just command a don't need
144:51 - none of this all right save it don't
144:53 - need none of this it's all I'm not going
144:55 - to say useless but it's unnecessary for
144:58 - us okay so that's done uh test.gs don't
145:01 - need any of this do remove delete this
145:03 - one right here too
145:05 - move to trash okay do not need that okay
145:08 - uh next thing logo you see this logo
145:10 - import logo from logo SVG don't need
145:12 - this either boom right here okay do not
145:16 - need that okay and that's pretty much it
145:19 - next up let me see next up let me see uh
145:25 - I will go ahead and do the following is
145:28 - let me go ahead and do this so we have
145:30 - that next up let's put you see how we
145:32 - have this counter we don't need this
145:33 - counter as well so that's not too more
145:35 - important local SVG remove this one
145:37 - unnecessary
145:39 - all right and now we have a pretty clean
145:42 - clean app now what I want to do is let's
145:44 - go ahead and create components all right
145:46 - I'm going to create new folder here I'm
145:47 - going to create a components folder
145:49 - right so the reason why we like to do
145:51 - that is because just it makes things so
145:53 - much simpler right so and just create a
145:55 - components folder and that's over all of
145:57 - your components will live now let's
146:00 - really think about how are we going to
146:02 - build this application right this
146:06 - application contains a lot of different
146:07 - aspects all right let's think about what
146:10 - it needs for us to actually build this
146:13 - um a few things as you can see here that
146:15 - part one is we kind of have the header
146:17 - right here
146:18 - that's part one and I'll always like to
146:20 - think about the structure of you know
146:22 - anything that I'm building so for
146:24 - example
146:25 - um if I do this so this right here is my
146:29 - header okay so I know that I need to
146:31 - build a header that's part one part two
146:33 - I need to go ahead and build a slider
146:35 - that's going to be another component I
146:36 - need to go ahead and create okay that's
146:38 - part two
146:39 - part three is I'm going to basically
146:41 - then build up this right here this
146:44 - viewer it's called a viewer right that's
146:47 - going to be what we will do with that so
146:49 - that's another component after that what
146:52 - we'll go ahead and do is we'll build
146:54 - this movies list that's going to be a
146:57 - third component and so what now has
147:01 - happened is we've just divided our
147:04 - application into multiple components
147:07 - right and this is how every single app
147:10 - works or basically on you know uh that's
147:14 - how every single app kind of works you
147:16 - know when we're going to build it in
147:18 - react.js honestly any app you're going
147:21 - to build online
147:24 - so let's see it
147:26 - so these are the coupons we want to
147:28 - build let's actually go ahead and build
147:29 - them right here now we know there's
147:32 - multiple Pages for here inside the
147:33 - app.js we'll create a component called
147:36 - header right here
147:39 - and this looks like a div but really
147:42 - it's kind of like it's a component so
147:44 - pretty much it is a div but it's a div
147:47 - that contains another component and what
147:49 - I will do is I will create a file inside
147:51 - click the components folder and I will
147:53 - say header.js
147:55 - that JS boom right there
147:57 - then what I'm going to do is I'm going
147:58 - to use the es7 code Snippets which
148:01 - hopefully you have when you install
148:02 - extensions which is this one right here
148:05 - you see esm react code Snippets
148:07 - right there right see esm red code
148:09 - Snippets right here hopefully you
148:11 - install that at this point and once
148:14 - you've done that if I click on here.js
148:16 - which is the one the file I created I
148:19 - will do rfce
148:23 - right and you can see this is our app.js
148:25 - so we have the header component inside
148:27 - here
148:28 - now that we've done that let's type in
148:30 - header in here so save that go to app.js
148:34 - and what's going to happen now at this
148:36 - point is well
148:38 - we need to import the header so I'm
148:40 - going to say import
148:41 - header from
148:44 - from what well from components folder
148:47 - from the components folder so I will do
148:49 - like this components Dash header done
148:53 - components Dash header okay I will go
148:56 - ahead and save this now at this point
148:57 - all right and once I've done that if if
149:00 - I look at my app look at that it says
149:03 - header right there
149:04 - had it right that is the header
149:07 - right so we've just created the header
149:09 - component using this okay all right
149:12 - beautiful now let's go to head.js and
149:15 - inside here we're going to use style
149:16 - component now what style components are
149:18 - basically CSS within JavaScript all
149:22 - right let's try this out
149:25 - um to use style components what I'm
149:27 - going to do is actually install them
149:29 - first so let's go ahead and do do Plus
149:30 - on our integrate terminal right here now
149:34 - we'll do the following npm install
149:37 - styled Dash components
149:41 - style Dash componentials done
149:45 - beautiful awesome
149:49 - style Dash components okay so this
149:51 - installed it is installed the components
149:53 - okay that's awesome there we go
149:56 - beautiful that's amazing and then what
149:59 - are we going to do now this point is we
150:01 - need to import it now right so I'm going
150:03 - to import styled
150:05 - from
150:08 - styled
150:10 - styled Dash comp styled
150:15 - Dash components
150:18 - beautiful awesome import style from the
150:20 - side dish components save that save that
150:24 - and look here's what we can do now check
150:25 - this out remember how we had this deal
150:27 - right remember this dip well I can
150:29 - replace this deal with it with actually
150:30 - a basically like a style component so
150:33 - check this out container
150:36 - our name is to container
150:39 - like so right to literally container
150:42 - right here
150:44 - right and you see it says container is
150:47 - not defined no problem whatsoever we'll
150:49 - fix it in a second here so I'm going to
150:51 - say now this point the following const
150:54 - container
150:56 - container is equal to styled dot div so
151:00 - really we're creating a div with
151:02 - JavaScript you see instead of saying div
151:05 - here we're saying container so we name
151:07 - it whatever we want but then we create a
151:09 - style.dip now check this out what can we
151:11 - do with that well a few things we can
151:13 - give it a height so let's give it a
151:15 - height for example let's give it a
151:16 - height
151:17 - height of let's say for example 70
151:19 - pixels
151:21 - 70 pixels okay save that all right and
151:25 - then let's get the background color so
151:27 - I'm gonna say background
151:29 - background color and I'm going to give
151:31 - it this color right here and you know I
151:33 - want you guys to copy this as well by
151:34 - yourself okay so this is 0 9 0 b 1 3
151:38 - that's hashtag right there all right
151:40 - save that beautiful and so for look at
151:43 - this right here boom
151:45 - look the header is created is pretty
151:48 - much created
151:49 - you see
151:51 - the header is now created right here
151:54 - which directly maps to just this
151:56 - container that's all all we literally
151:59 - had to do
152:00 - that's all we had to do right that's all
152:03 - we had to do okay beautiful all right
152:06 - next up once we've done that so that's
152:08 - in the background color right all right
152:11 - so let's go ahead and save this
152:13 - background color so that's in the header
152:15 - okay beautiful next up is the format
152:18 - it's going to now create another
152:19 - component called home
152:21 - now what is the home well the home will
152:24 - be this portion which is
152:27 - this whole thing right well called home
152:30 - component right right why we're going to
152:32 - call home component what do you think
152:34 - we're going why do you think we're going
152:35 - to call the Home component like let me
152:37 - know in the comments below right it's
152:39 - because we have multiple Pages we have a
152:42 - home page we have a you know a login
152:45 - page and we have a detail page when I
152:48 - click on a detail I have a detail page
152:50 - as well and so that's what we're going
152:52 - to call home
152:53 - inside components new file let's create
152:55 - home home.gs
152:58 - boom right there beautiful beautiful
153:01 - beautiful beautiful so that's that's our
153:03 - home.js let's do rfce again and again if
153:06 - you don't have RFC just kind of copy
153:08 - this portion right here to your terminal
153:11 - uh to enter your vs code okay and that's
153:14 - going to call this home
153:16 - boom right there awesome
153:18 - Okay add that GS let's import home of
153:21 - course we need to import it the cool
153:23 - thing about react.js is you can Import
153:25 - and Export things right just kind of how
153:26 - you you Import and Export with you know
153:28 - with trucks and you know in real life
153:30 - it's the same thing we can export just
153:33 - how you see if you go to home.gs you see
153:35 - you export a function or a component
153:38 - right you export it right here and then
153:40 - inside app.js we import it so I'm going
153:42 - to say here home
153:45 - from
153:47 - pom pom
153:48 - components
153:50 - Dash what which one do you think would
153:52 - do home right that's the one we're going
153:55 - to create beautiful
153:57 - all right next thing we're going to do
153:59 - is put the home inside here
154:02 - boom right there
154:04 - all right all right beautiful so let's
154:06 - go ahead and save this one
154:08 - all right I like it I like it I like it
154:10 - and if you go to home.js we'll call it
154:12 - home so really if we go to our react app
154:14 - boom we have home right here right now
154:16 - bars here home is here awesome all right
154:19 - so part one let's focus on just the
154:23 - header for now right our goal is to get
154:25 - to a hair that looks pretty much just
154:27 - kind of like this
154:29 - pretty much just kind of like this right
154:30 - here okay let's go just kind of like
154:32 - this all right so what are we going to
154:34 - do inside here well a few things right
154:36 - let's go and divide this up into a few
154:37 - different things well we have here this
154:39 - is the everything about this the divs is
154:41 - we have this is a div this is an image
154:43 - and now we have a connect menu portion
154:46 - right here right and then we call this a
154:48 - nav menu and then this is going to be
154:50 - like um a profile image right here so
154:52 - pretty much we're thinking about three
154:54 - divs that we need to go ahead and create
154:55 - beautiful
154:57 - all right three dips let's think about
154:59 - this now inside here in terms of
155:01 - container I'm actually going to change
155:03 - this name to not be container about I
155:05 - want you just to be nav so nav and by
155:07 - the way to actually make it happen to
155:09 - the cell you see how I just added it at
155:11 - the same time here's a cool trick click
155:13 - command d
155:15 - in vs code or Ctrl D
155:17 - and it will select all these things
155:19 - automatically for you and you just
155:21 - change on the Fly
155:23 - see for example let me see see it
155:26 - changes everything in the flight
155:28 - how cool is that huh give me a thumbs up
155:30 - if you think if you think that's cool
155:31 - give me a thumbs up thinking that thing
155:33 - that if you think if you think that's
155:34 - awesome I think it's pretty cool yeah
155:36 - yeah yeah yeah yeah all right there we
155:38 - go beautiful beautiful sweet all right
155:41 - so now instead of doing style that div
155:43 - I'm going to do style.now so it's going
155:46 - to be navigation bar and that's just a
155:48 - little more user friendly with HTML5
155:49 - that's pretty much the reason why
155:52 - once we've done that let's go ahead and
155:54 - do the following
155:56 - um well let's go ahead and create our
155:58 - actual logo so I'm going to create a
155:59 - logo here
156:01 - logo again it's going also going to be
156:03 - style component source with a certain
156:05 - image no image just yet okay
156:07 - okay logo let's go ahead and do this
156:10 - const
156:11 - const logo
156:13 - right const logo style the image
156:16 - logo
156:19 - right there of equals oh styled dot
156:23 - image right there that's an image right
156:25 - again
156:26 - and again these quotes right here these
156:29 - quote this code are called template
156:31 - little pretty much or I call backticks
156:33 - and this is where we put our CSS inside
156:35 - here all right beautiful and then aside
156:37 - here we're going to give it a width of
156:39 - width of 80 pixels so width
156:42 - 80 pixels all right now with now with
156:46 - guys okay with
156:48 - I'm not the best uh you know I'm not the
156:52 - best typer I will say that with 80
156:54 - pixels okay
156:56 - all right so so we have the logo I can
156:58 - see there's nothing again does not show
157:00 - up on here but here's what we can do all
157:02 - right now let's go ahead and focus on
157:04 - the nav menu all right so we have the
157:06 - nav menu here
157:08 - nav menu let's create this other
157:10 - component now menu
157:16 - nav menu and we're going to create it
157:19 - into a div so it's the same thing here
157:20 - you see the cool thing about style
157:23 - components is that I'm creating CSS
157:25 - within the actual Javascript file I'll
157:27 - have to go back and forth between two
157:29 - files nav menu
157:31 - equals
157:33 - styled dot div done
157:36 - Zone
157:39 - done all right that's awesome okay no
157:43 - error so far now how do we go ahead and

162:04 - ahead and create the image all right so
162:06 - what what I need to do is this for the
162:08 - source it will actually be Dash images
162:11 - Dash logo Dash
162:15 - logo.svg Now where's it coming from
162:19 - you see images right here along with SVG
162:21 - directly from here
162:25 - from here right here okay that's where
162:27 - it's coming from all right all right
162:29 - let's go and save this one
162:31 - refresh boom right there we got the
162:33 - Disney plus logo just like that how cool
162:38 - is that right all right beautiful let's
162:40 - go ahead and maybe add some Panic to
162:41 - this you see how it's all the way on the
162:43 - top I don't like that instead what I'm
162:46 - going to do is I'm going to center it so
162:47 - to center it I'm actually going to focus
162:49 - on the main nav the nav is this whole
162:52 - div right here okay
162:54 - that's the whole nap and I'm going to
162:56 - tell a display Flex right so this
162:58 - play-fi is going to allow us to very
163:01 - easily to very easily
163:04 - very easily structure our code our
163:07 - structure our front end display flex and
163:10 - so save that see that puts it right
163:12 - there and I'm going to say align item
163:15 - Center
163:18 - item Center
163:20 - to Center vertically
163:22 - boom see now it's under vertical right
163:24 - here I'm going to give some padding
163:27 - I'm going to say petting 036 pixels
163:31 - all right pending zero through it now
163:32 - what is all this zero means top and
163:35 - bottom this means zero pixels for top
163:37 - and bottom 36 bit so this means left and
163:39 - right padding okay that means left and
163:42 - right padding okay that's what that
163:44 - means all right so let's go ahead and
163:46 - save that
163:47 - all right beautiful that looks so much
163:49 - better now guys check this out that
163:50 - looks so good all right I love that so
163:52 - logo is there let's now focus on the nav
163:55 - menu that one is a little bit going to
163:57 - be trickier okay
163:58 - and that menu will have a few things
164:00 - okay
164:01 - the first thing will be is every single
164:04 - icon here that you see right every
164:06 - single icon what it is is basically this
164:10 - right here is an a tag this is an a tag
164:12 - and inside here we have a logo and a
164:15 - span tag so let's take a look at this oh
164:18 - if I say here for example if I say oop
164:21 - let's go remove this for a second here
164:23 - boom I'm going to say a
164:27 - right I'm going to give it a that logo
164:30 - you see which is this image right here
164:32 - right this image right here I'm going to
164:34 - say here image
164:37 - source is equal to beautiful and let's
164:42 - do it go to images
164:45 - Dash home icon home Dash
164:49 - icon dot SVG
164:53 - done
164:54 - okay all right and then let's go ahead
164:56 - and do a span here
164:59 - all right
165:00 - and we'll give it home
165:02 - done
165:04 - so a tag home so if I say this let's see
165:06 - what this turns out to oh it looks so
165:09 - horrible that's okay no problem with
165:12 - Summer okay so you see the icon is there
165:14 - which is great but of course you know
165:15 - the fact that home page is here the
165:17 - homepage we don't really see that's
165:18 - mainly because of the color right we
165:19 - need to give it a color that's that's
165:21 - pretty much wide all right so a few
165:24 - things that I want you guys to think
165:25 - about is the following
165:27 - let's go ahead and focus on this home
165:29 - icon partially the Span needs to be
165:31 - color white so to make a color white we
165:35 - need to go to the following let's make
165:37 - the whole thing color white what I mean
165:39 - by that is let's go to index.css all
165:42 - right and this body let's give the full
165:45 - color to be white
165:47 - see this one white
165:50 - right it makes this homepage now white
165:51 - see right there it just showed up just
165:53 - like that just like that beautiful all
165:57 - right
165:59 - now let's make this icon be the left
166:03 - side of this home icon right how do we
166:06 - structure from being like this to being
166:07 - like this right that's the question well
166:10 - it's very simple it's all using display
166:11 - Flex so
166:13 - I'm going to go back to my header
166:17 - I'm going to back to my header.js okay
166:21 - JS and I will say the following
166:25 - where am I where am I where am I okay
166:27 - yes no menu so here what I'm gonna do
166:30 - display Flex
166:34 - Part One display Flex on this all right
166:36 - now that's not really change anything
166:38 - here right it's still home is like this
166:40 - uh instead what I will do the following
166:42 - I will say a here you see and then here
166:45 - I will say display facts again the a
166:47 - we're targeting this a tag that's the
166:49 - link tag right so a will say display
166:51 - Flex
166:54 - display Flex
166:55 - awesome save that boom you see now this
166:59 - icon all of a sudden now it's very
167:01 - different it's left to right instead of
167:02 - top to bottom just simple that all right
167:04 - so that's good
167:06 - let me kind of make this
167:08 - all right beautiful right there
167:10 - okay that's the blue flags then what I'm
167:13 - gonna do is I'm going to align this time
167:14 - so I'm say align items
167:16 - items
167:18 - Center save it done you see now this
167:21 - home icon is centered right here
167:22 - together with the icon itself okay next
167:24 - up let's go and add some padding to it
167:26 - some say padding
167:29 - padding 0 12 pixels and what this does
167:31 - is this is going to add Paddy on the
167:33 - left and the right hand side okay
167:36 - beautiful next up let's do the image
167:38 - let's go ahead and change this image
167:40 - because it's way too large right this is
167:42 - this is our this image logo so in size
167:45 - style components I'm going to say image
167:48 - now you may wondering now how the heck
167:50 - is like are we able to Target all these
167:52 - CSS like this well that's the power of
167:55 - style components what we can do is we
167:57 - can we can Target it basically our
168:00 - elements like a tree for example here
168:02 - we're targeting the attack within the
168:05 - nav menu div here we're targeting the
168:08 - image tag within the a tag you see so we
168:11 - can do that in style components
168:13 - right for images let's make the image
168:16 - here height
168:18 - of 20 pixels and whenever we give a
168:19 - height the the width changes
168:21 - automatically
168:22 - beautiful oh so much better so much
168:25 - better so much better all right so much
168:28 - better I like it so much more beautiful
168:29 - we got that portion let's now go to the
168:33 - uh the span tag okay so span
168:38 - okay and then here uh pretty much again
168:42 - nothing much let's change the font size
168:43 - here so we'll say font size not don't

169:13 - issues just speak out loud and I'll be
169:15 - able to resolve anything okay

169:23 - you see it changes a little bit there's
169:25 - a little bit of a difference now in
169:25 - terms of how it looks like which is

171:41 - series Dash icon let's go ahead and save
171:43 - that
171:45 - oh
171:47 - beautiful look at that oh
171:50 - oh that's so good oh
171:52 - let's go that's amazing guys that's
171:57 - amazing that's so good there we go look
171:59 - at that
172:01 - so that's our going to be our navigation
172:04 - menu now at this point now we're not
172:06 - done yet
172:07 - [Music]
172:14 - I gotta have some fun sometimes okay
172:17 - all right next up
172:19 - is going to be the user image profile
172:23 - all right so let me go ahead
172:25 - all right uh the next one is going to be
172:28 - this one right here which is this little
172:29 - literally this little small icon right
172:31 - here that's all we are going to do uh
172:34 - let me do this here and this this is
172:36 - going to be called the user image so
172:38 - here we'll say user
172:39 - user Imager
172:42 - right and so forth now with this image
172:45 - let's go ahead and go down here
172:48 - and we'll say const
172:50 - user image
172:52 - is equal to styled dot div
172:56 - oh no not that they're actually that
172:58 - image it's going to be an image type
173:00 - component you see so with style
173:01 - components you can have different type
173:03 - components images you can have spans we
173:06 - can have divs right now but basically
173:08 - any HTML component you can have you can
173:10 - have that with a style component all
173:12 - right
173:13 - now on the user image the image we're
173:16 - going to use for the time being is going
173:19 - to be just this one right here it's
173:20 - going to be you can use any image you
173:22 - want technically but I have this one
173:24 - right here and hopefully we can have a
173:27 - monitor David put in the chat
173:30 - there we go
173:32 - and that's going to be pretty that's
173:33 - actually my image it's actually me
173:35 - that's not
173:36 - all right let's see let's see how does
173:39 - it look like oh let's go let's me
173:42 - if you have your own picture use your
173:44 - own picture I highly recommend that you
173:46 - use a square picture that's gonna be
173:47 - very helpful very helpful to you okay
173:50 - all right so that's gonna be sick okay
173:53 - so do that now of course we're not done
173:55 - yet uh we need to do is let's go ahead
173:57 - and make this a little bit better well
174:00 - let's go ahead and set the way so check
174:02 - this out guys if I want to edit the
174:04 - style for this I hit command and click
174:06 - on this you see anomalous Styles check
174:09 - this out how cool is that out command
174:11 - click on the actual user image I think
174:13 - in Windows is control click I think so
174:15 - or Windows click I'm not sure try one of
174:18 - those so inside the user image I'm going
174:19 - to say width
174:21 - with 48 pixels
174:24 - okay height
174:27 - height also 48 pixels
174:31 - done save it all right now it's a bit
174:33 - smaller which is great and then I'm
174:35 - going to get a border radius
174:38 - borders radius
174:40 - of 50 now what that does is that gives
174:43 - it basically a circle that makes it into
174:45 - a circle because the Border radius
174:46 - basically as the Cur the beautiful most
174:48 - beautiful curvature on there on all the
174:50 - corners right you see right here fifty
174:52 - percent of the full image is going to be
174:54 - basically curved up that's what I mean
174:55 - next thing I'm going to make it to
174:57 - cursor pointer the reason why we do that
174:58 - is because it looks like or it feels
175:01 - like a you know a button
175:04 - the youth all right oh let's go all
175:08 - right last thing look at this you see
175:10 - how this icon is all at all with the
175:12 - left hand side well what I can do is I
175:14 - can actually expand the nav menu the nav
175:17 - menu right here to push this icon all
175:20 - the way to the right hand side by using
175:22 - what what do you guys think we can do
175:23 - here let me know what do you guys think
175:25 - put in the chat what do you guys think
175:26 - we can do to push this now menu
175:29 - right here all the way to the right hand
175:31 - side well that's very simple actually
175:35 - I can go to the nav menu and I can say
175:38 - the nav menu hey you know what let's
175:40 - give the flex of a one look at this
175:43 - nav menu I'm gonna say Flex
175:45 - one and what that does that's biscuit
175:48 - says look at this that says hey this
175:49 - name menu is the most important thing
175:51 - right and you want to explain to as much
175:53 - as possible and so that's what that what
175:55 - that does okay
175:57 - I'm going to give it a small margin left
175:59 - 20 pixels
176:01 - margin left
176:03 - modular 20 pixels
176:06 - is tomorrow ah
176:09 - margin Dash left
176:12 - I'm gonna give it 20 pixels
176:16 - 20 pixels right here uh 25 actually
176:20 - give some spacing and they'll add inside
176:22 - there you go just to give spacing and
176:24 - then the last I want to do is for each a
176:26 - tag I'm gonna give it a cursor pointer
176:34 - all right cursor pointer
176:37 - and what that does is going to make you
176:38 - like a hand there we go now it's a hand
176:40 - you see that right there now it's a hand
176:42 - okay but okay we're not done yet I also
176:45 - want to make this into a line item
176:47 - Center so this basically will here will
176:49 - Center it vertically so I'll line items
176:53 - [Music]
176:56 - might not change might not change a
176:58 - little bit just see that does not change
176:59 - much honestly right here
177:01 - it's beautiful right there all right so
177:02 - align them Center and that's looking
177:04 - pretty good wouldn't you say so what do
177:06 - you guys think let me know let me know
177:08 - in the comments below let me know in the
177:09 - chat what are you guys think so far
177:10 - that's looking really really good so far
177:13 - all right I like it next up
177:16 - all right next one let's go ahead and
177:18 - make that a beautiful animation that we
177:19 - have just this one
177:21 - so this is going to be really really
177:23 - cool the way we make this happen is
177:25 - really cool really cool all right
177:28 - Monique says beautiful I like it thank
177:30 - you money all right
177:32 - let's go and check up on YouTube here
177:34 - for a second here
177:35 - all right that's what I'm talking
177:37 - Nicholas says awesome sweet Flex ah you
177:41 - guys are amazing I like it nice bro
177:43 - Javier says nice bro
177:46 - all right all right now a few things
177:50 - that we need to make to make it kind of
177:52 - like uh you know
177:54 - to make that portion happen so
177:57 - um check this one out this is going to
177:59 - be like a really cool trick that maybe
178:01 - you have not learned before but
178:03 - inside the
178:06 - um here inside this span
178:08 - this pan here's what we can do
178:11 - we can use something called
178:14 - um after so what does it do right here
178:16 - I'm gonna say here I'm gonna say this
178:18 - this after
178:20 - now what this adds is this adds almost
178:23 - like a div this adds a div right here so
178:26 - I'm gonna say after I'm gonna give a
178:27 - content and I'll explain what again what
178:30 - it does in a second here content of
178:31 - empty string
178:33 - okay and I'm going to give it a height
178:36 - so
178:37 - imagine it like a normal div height of
178:40 - two pixels
178:41 - I have two pixels and I'm going to say
178:43 - background is white
178:46 - background
178:48 - is white
178:51 - okay and then what I'm going to do is
178:53 - I'm going to position okay well for now
178:55 - it's going to see what does that do and
178:58 - let's see refresh uh nothing so much
179:01 - because we need to give the width so
179:02 - let's give the actually give the Contour
179:04 - like hello jello
179:08 - see there you go there it is right here
179:09 - it's called Jello see and it's back on
179:12 - color white if I remove this black and
179:14 - color white
179:16 - Jello now what it does if I when it's
179:19 - back download on this one
179:23 - here's what it does
179:24 - is it adds a div after the ending of
179:28 - everything so check this out if I go to
179:30 - span you see there's home and then
179:32 - there's a after imagine this after
179:34 - almost like a div
179:37 - like a div
179:39 - you see and it has the content Jello and
179:42 - a height of two pixels
179:43 - and with that we can actually be very
179:46 - very very useful we can actually be very
179:49 - smart with that let's go and save this
179:52 - beautiful all right let's go and do that
179:54 - save that all right and of course we
179:58 - don't need Jello at this point right no
180:00 - I mean unless you guys like jello who
180:02 - like jello here anybody likes Jello here
180:03 - I like jello I'm a big fan of jello I
180:06 - love Jello it's my favorite favorite
180:07 - type of food okay love jello
180:11 - all right beautiful there we go that's
180:15 - what I'm talking about
180:16 - so let's go ahead and do the following
180:18 - now so how am I going to position this
180:21 - you see how this position inside here
180:23 - especially at the bottom
180:25 - how do we make that work well let's
180:27 - think about it I'm going to use
180:29 - something called position absolute so
180:31 - here's what I'll do I'll do position
180:32 - absolute
180:35 - absolute
180:37 - absolute right here
180:39 - and I'll give a top of zero
180:43 - of zero and I was playing well how that
180:46 - works out a little bit top left
180:48 - of zero
180:50 - right of zero
180:54 - and then bottom
180:57 - is actually going to be minus six pixels
181:00 - so why mine is not you might be asking
181:02 - well a few reasons why
181:05 - save this
181:07 - as you can see right there it's still
181:08 - not show now because why we need to give
181:11 - it if you're going to position absolute
181:13 - something it needs to be positioned to
181:16 - what to a relative object
181:19 - well let's make the same the the span
181:22 - position relative and so you have to
181:23 - give it a parent to cling on to
181:27 - right
181:29 - so let's go ahead and save that position
181:31 - relative content High 20 pixels okay
181:34 - okay okay opacity of one background
181:38 - color white
181:40 - all right let's go and refresh this
181:43 - still not there let me see make sure
181:44 - it's all out it's all good let me see
181:46 - inspect that one and this one
181:52 - home
181:54 - oh because I did not put this correctly
181:58 - there you go
182:00 - boom
182:01 - right there you see now it's at the top
182:05 - okay it's at the top or why because I do
182:08 - I though this top zero don't need this
182:10 - remove this one
182:12 - type zero boo now to the bottom you see
182:14 - that right there look now it's at the
182:16 - bottom so we have this line here that
182:18 - was created how well we said that okay
182:21 - you have this div right here
182:24 - it's called a span okay we have this div
182:26 - and we said hey you know what let's all
182:28 - let's go ahead and create another div
182:30 - we're using after but let's make that
182:32 - div which is this one right here let's
182:35 - make the small div let's give it a
182:37 - height of two pixels
182:39 - a backup color of white unless absolute
182:42 - position it to the left where there's no
182:44 - space to left there's no space to the
182:46 - right and from the bottom it's like for
182:48 - example wait
182:50 - from the left create no spacing from the
182:52 - right there's no spacing and then from
182:54 - the bottom there's only
182:57 - negative six pixels meaning it will push
183:00 - it down it will actually push down the
183:02 - div below this band component
183:06 - that's really cool part you need to
183:07 - understand
183:09 - right it will push down below this Bank
183:11 - opponent okay let's go ahead and
183:12 - continue on all right awesome sweet
183:15 - sweet sweet you guys still good yes yes
183:17 - yes yes yes beautiful beautiful all
183:19 - right all right Derek I think you're
183:21 - still good Alex you're still a little
183:22 - good Jared I think look you're still
183:24 - good as well beautiful Leonard as well
183:27 - and same as Christian all right sweet
183:29 - sweet all right all right now the way we
183:32 - need to start out now of course when we
183:34 - go ahead and build stuff like this of
183:36 - course you see how that does not show up
183:38 - until until we actually do something
183:40 - about it right until we hover over it so
183:42 - how do we make that happen well
183:45 - um very simple very simple let's do
183:47 - initially we're going to give the
183:48 - passive zero
183:49 - passive zero
183:52 - opacity of zero
183:55 - and then we'll do transform skill X zero
183:59 - so what does this do
184:02 - scale x0 basically is going to scale the
184:05 - I'm going to go ahead and comments will
184:07 - pass it here for a second so it's going
184:09 - to scale the div to zero if I do 0.5
184:12 - it's going to make it 0.5 you see that
184:15 - right there 0.5 the simple as that right
184:19 - all right if I make it for example 1
184:22 - dance can be the full thing right there
184:25 - see
184:26 - but if I do zero it's going to make it
184:28 - zero okay now in our case I'm going to
184:30 - make a zero and also passes zero and
184:32 - then well here's what we'll do on the
184:34 - hover of span
184:36 - on the hover actually of the whole a tag
184:39 - which is inside here look at this I'll
184:41 - do the following this this this will say
184:43 - hover
184:45 - boom voila I will do spin
184:49 - after right
184:53 - right and the hover of this of this
184:54 - spent after was a transform
184:59 - transform scale
185:03 - X
185:04 - into one so we go from zero
185:07 - to one scale basically from zero width
185:11 - to the full 100 width that's what that
185:14 - means
185:15 - and then I'm going to give opacity
185:17 - of one
185:20 - for that all right let's try it
185:23 - let's try it oh oh does not work that's
185:25 - okay that's okay because we need to give
185:28 - it a transform from what to what so
185:30 - check this out I need to give this
185:33 - transform origin from left to the center
185:38 - let's try refresh again oh two two two
185:41 - that's not really happening here let's
185:43 - go ahead and see what's going on here so
185:44 - we have a tag that's on here on the
185:48 - hover of that
185:50 - ban we're calling the span which is that
185:53 - one
185:54 - right after
185:57 - transform
186:00 - transform scale X
186:04 - one oh right here right there that's the
186:07 - one
186:08 - boom boom boom boom look at that see
186:11 - boom boom boom so it shows up on the
186:14 - hover you see opacity wanna transfer
186:16 - scale works one but let's make it even
186:18 - beautiful beautiful look at this
186:21 - all right
186:22 - I'm going to add a transition
186:26 - and hear the transition this is a
186:28 - special transition and this says
186:29 - transition everything all all attributes
186:31 - at 250 milliseconds and this is a
186:34 - special type of tradition right this
186:36 - right here basically says what type of a
186:38 - transition there's like a linear
186:40 - transition this is this right here
186:42 - number has a special temperature it may
186:44 - be for example a month then maybe you
186:45 - can put it down the chat in the zoom in
186:48 - this specific text right here right
186:49 - cubic bizire cubic bizarre right here
186:53 - all right
186:54 - so it's a really cool transition that if
186:57 - I now apply this
186:59 - oh oh oh let's go let's go
187:04 - boom boom boom boom boom boom
187:10 - look at that guys
187:14 - how cool
187:16 - is that
187:18 - look at that
187:23 - how cool is that what do you guys think
187:24 - huh that's pretty awesome what you think
187:26 - so that's pretty awesome you can
187:28 - actually have this like I said it's this
187:29 - one right here pubic desire right a
187:33 - little bit desire
187:34 - use that one you can do linear as well
187:36 - but ah you can do linear but we don't
187:38 - want that that's not not not too much
187:40 - fun all right so save that
187:43 - and that's it our header now at this
187:46 - point is officially done that's it it's
187:49 - done done so that's it comprende all
187:52 - right all right so that's all good
187:55 - Hatter is finished okay header is
187:58 - finished and let's go ahead and go to
188:00 - here a git and I'm going to actually
188:01 - save it so I'm going to say add header
188:03 - so I'm going to save this inside the git
188:05 - and I want you guys to get used to doing
188:07 - stuff with this as well so add header
188:09 - that's going to save it into our get all
188:12 - right and that's it we don't have to
188:14 - worry about anything else at this point
188:16 - besides that
188:20 - that looks so good by the way that looks
188:22 - so great that looks so good well don't
188:24 - you guys think it looks awesome raise
188:25 - your hand I think this looks amazing
188:27 - yeah and it's the way it's done is very
188:30 - intricate too it's all using CSS you see
188:32 - right this transform origin is saying
188:34 - hey go from the left corner to the
188:36 - center right here you see kind of uh
188:38 - from left corner to the center that's
188:40 - the same the transition say transition
188:41 - all of this and the transform says scale
188:44 - it from zero to one
188:47 - that's it that's all I'm saying that's
188:49 - as simple as that all right
188:52 - let me see now disappointing YouTube we
188:55 - have 356 people on YouTube let's go 423
188:58 - people on YouTube that is beautiful
188:59 - amazing amazing excited to see all of
189:02 - you wow wow that's actually pretty great
189:04 - all right so that's what we have this at
189:07 - this point okay
189:08 - I know everybody looks yeah it's amazing
189:10 - that's cool that's cool it's cool I like
189:12 - it okay so that's part one let's now
189:14 - look at the home page okay
189:17 - the home page now let me go ahead and
189:18 - focus put this on the right hand side
189:20 - and put it more on the right hand side
189:22 - all right home page is done check mark
189:25 - all right next up
189:27 - let oh header is done check mark next up
189:29 - is home page homepage is going to be a
189:31 - little bit more difficult but that's
189:33 - completely okay let's go to the home
189:34 - page all right
189:36 - um so the homepage will have a few
189:38 - things all right of course uh let's
189:40 - start out with a container here like we
189:42 - always like to do so let's go and import
189:43 - style components here import styled from
189:48 - from what style components Dash
189:52 - components all right sweet aimport stuff
189:55 - to the style components let's do the
189:57 - following so const container
190:01 - equal styled the what start that there
190:05 - for now oh actually no style domain so
190:07 - mean is actually a great it's a very
190:10 - HTML5 friendly basically it tells Google
190:13 - or any other browser that this is the
190:15 - main content right so it's the same
190:17 - thing as saying div except that uh you
190:19 - know underneath the hood Google likes to
190:22 - read that so that's why we say Main all
190:24 - right
190:25 - now for this one let's do the following
190:28 - for this one okay
190:30 - um a few things few things
190:35 - all right a few things we need to think
190:37 - about here uh first things first let's
190:40 - do a main height so we're going to do
190:42 - Min height
190:43 - main height here
190:46 - so what is the main height uh really is
190:48 - the following
190:50 - um
190:51 - remember how this height is 70 pixels
190:54 - so this right here is 70 pixels okay
190:56 - that's 70 pixels all right
190:58 - then that's mean that this will be what
191:01 - the rest correct so that this right here
191:03 - it means will be those will be the rest
191:05 - of the the height right so that's what
191:07 - that's what that means well
191:09 - to make that happen here's what we can
191:11 - do I can say calc
191:13 - so CSS can actually calculate stuff for
191:15 - you I can say a hundred VH that means a
191:19 - hundred vertical height 100 ago that's
191:22 - the full width from top to bottom of the
191:25 - view view height viewport that's the
191:28 - browser height
191:29 - minus 70 pixels right
191:33 - so that's the height
191:35 - main height is this full height
191:37 - beautiful we got that all right all
191:40 - right so we have that and then another
191:42 - padding to it
191:45 - padding
191:46 - padding and I'm gonna go to zero calc
191:49 - here
191:50 - and all this is saying is this is 3.5
191:52 - view uh vertical uh kind of view width
191:57 - 2.4 or 3.5 actually 3.5 view width
192:02 - plus five pixels that's just pretty much
192:04 - it's nothing too crazy just a very soft
192:05 - calculation so this means top bottom
192:09 - zero pixels left and right is this one
192:11 - right here
192:13 - sorry all right now how do we actually
192:15 - see this well it's very simple let's go
192:17 - ahead and actually add a background
192:18 - color here
192:19 - back on blue
192:21 - let's see our
192:23 - let's see background blue okay does not
192:26 - show up on there background color blue
192:29 - blue is that there or no let me see
192:31 - inspect element in this one
192:33 - um let's see inspect Alma here
192:35 - [Music]
192:36 - uh body
192:38 - root app
192:41 - Dave home
192:46 - oh here's why the reason why it's not
192:49 - working is because remember what we did
192:50 - here is we forgot to put the container
192:52 - so container is actually being used here
192:54 - instead of div
192:55 - container boom
192:59 - container nice I like oh that's cool
193:04 - let's remove this hideous color please
193:06 - I don't like that okay so so that's all
193:09 - good now with the color that we do want
193:11 - to use however is going to be like a
193:13 - home color a background color it's gonna
193:15 - be actually this color right here so
193:16 - what I want you guys to do to add a nice
193:18 - background color
193:20 - is that CSS here
193:22 - in the index.css here and let's go to
193:26 - body and do here background color right
193:30 - here hashtag zero four zero seven one
193:32 - four it's a nice color that we're going
193:34 - to use for the Disney plus clone okay
193:36 - that's that's ever see nothing too crazy
193:38 - just just a very simple one okay
193:41 - just about that all right beautiful all
193:43 - right next up so that's all good let's
193:45 - go ahead and go to
193:47 - home.gus all right I like it I like it
193:51 - like that
193:53 - I like it like taking it
193:57 - anyways guys all right let me see so
194:00 - that's all good next up is gonna be
194:02 - watch next up is going to be
194:04 - we need to now add the background image
194:08 - now if you look at our Disney plus clone
194:10 - make it a little bit bigger you see we
194:12 - have this background image that looks
194:14 - that's in here see this as I scroll you
194:17 - see it's there you see that as I scroll
194:20 - there's a background image in there you
194:22 - can have to look very close in here you
194:24 - see it's a background image
194:26 - so how do we make that work well
194:29 - um let's take a look at it
194:30 - what we're going to do is we're going to
194:32 - use this after before stuff that we
194:34 - talked about before okay before that's
194:37 - that's a fun that's a funny pun funny
194:39 - punners before
194:41 - all right done before and
194:45 - it basically will add a div before the
194:48 - container check this out I'm gonna say
194:50 - background
194:52 - background here now it's a URL boom done
194:56 - okay I'm gonna give it Dash images Dash
195:00 - images a dash home Dash background
195:06 - that what that PNG done okay now so
195:11 - that's the URL I'm gonna say
195:14 - Center
195:15 - that's the vertically Center
195:17 - horizontally centered right and then I'm
195:19 - going to say what
195:21 - um center dash
195:23 - where am I where am I right okay sender
195:26 - then I'm going to cover
195:31 - and then I'm going to say
195:33 - no repeat and fixed
195:36 - so no repeat means do not repeat this no
195:39 - repeat do not repeat repeat uh
195:43 - this image
195:45 - right and it can be a fixed image now
195:48 - how fixed we'll talk about that in a
195:49 - second here
195:50 - all right now it's still not there of
195:53 - course it's not here right you don't see
195:54 - you don't you only see oh that's not
195:56 - good right you still see only this no
195:59 - problem whatsoever right so let's do
196:01 - this
196:02 - right so again it's URL images whole
196:05 - background PNG Center Center cover no
196:08 - repeat fix no changes so far don't worry
196:11 - I'm gonna do content here
196:13 - check this out now content nothing just
196:16 - how I usually like to do it okay now
196:18 - again if I add content for example like
196:20 - y'all save that
196:23 - yo see it adds a before right there see
196:27 - let's go ahead and do it like this
196:29 - right there I think I'm going to
196:31 - position absolute that's the cool part
196:33 - position
196:36 - absolute
196:37 - right
196:39 - all right right and I'm going to say now
196:41 - the following top zero
196:45 - left zero
196:48 - zero then I'm going to say write zero
196:54 - right and then bottom
196:57 - uh
196:58 - bottom zero right save that
197:02 - now still nothing happens why because
197:05 - the following because we need to make it
197:07 - absolute to what I need to make this
197:09 - position
197:10 - relative
197:12 - save that
197:14 - all right save it let's see let's see
197:16 - position relative
197:17 - background is this content is this and
197:21 - fixed the Mississippi absolute
197:25 - refresh this
197:27 - um I don't really see the background
197:28 - image yeah there's no bueno let me see
197:30 - your L am I doing this right bottom zero
197:35 - I'm gonna say Z index
197:38 - minus one
197:44 - all right I don't see the background
197:46 - image just yet don't worry about that
197:47 - we'll make that happen a little bit here
197:50 - let's see I think it has to put this
197:52 - back on let me let me try this
197:57 - just for a second here
198:01 - boom boom boom boom boom boom
198:05 - okay so there was a little bit of mix up
198:08 - here so I guess I did it wrong in terms
198:11 - of how we set the background so here's
198:12 - what we'll do background URL right there
198:15 - images home background.png
198:18 - Center this horizontal vertical Center
198:20 - this is basically the type of
198:21 - positioning here right this is
198:23 - background position cover right I'm
198:26 - going to add a dash here
198:27 - so Dash
198:29 - cover
198:31 - and after that we say
198:33 - no repeat
198:35 - and then we say fixed okay so fix means
198:38 - basically fixed on the page so if I
198:40 - scroll if I scroll it will always be
198:42 - fixed on there okay that's what that
198:44 - means guys if I scroll it will always be
198:46 - fixed on there that's what that means
198:49 - look how good this looks already
198:51 - so good
198:53 - so good I like it that looks beautiful
198:56 - and again how does it work again right
198:58 - because if you think about this
199:01 - let's look at our rectangle here
199:03 - boom there's a rectangle right that's
199:06 - our home let me go ahead and forces here
199:08 - this right here is our home component
199:09 - you can see right then what we did is
199:12 - when we did before
199:14 - we added another div right there's no
199:19 - name for it right and we give it a
199:21 - content of nothing and we need position
199:23 - absolute top zero left zero right zero
199:26 - bottom zero meaning here's what that
199:27 - means that it's going to be 0 pixels
199:31 - from the left zero pixel from the top
199:33 - zero pixels from the bottom of this from
199:38 - the bottom right the zip is from the
199:40 - right so when you do that you stretch
199:43 - the whole div
199:45 - to the end of this dip like so oops to
199:49 - this right here that's what you do and
199:51 - so now we have this extra div that blue
199:53 - chip salute it will not move anywhere
199:55 - and it will be behind all content all
199:58 - the time
199:59 - because we give it a z index of minus
200:02 - one
200:03 - that's why okay so I want you guys to
200:05 - really think about that Z is a big deal
200:08 - this is 0 minus one you will later on if
200:10 - you will see when I add content to it
200:11 - like if I do for example if I forget
200:13 - this music let's remove this for a
200:14 - second here
200:17 - see the home was gone right if I do see
200:21 - them as one home is out there you see
200:23 - that's why that's what that's so
200:25 - important
200:26 - okay and honestly
200:29 - that's it
200:30 - you're done
200:32 - on this container home now of course no
200:33 - you're not pretty much done but this is
200:36 - looking now very good raise your hand if
200:38 - you're still with it are you still with
200:39 - me raise your hand yeah you guys still
200:41 - with me how beautiful is this turnout to
200:44 - be just within about what one hour at
200:47 - this point within one hour we've gone so
200:49 - far now exactly
200:52 - it's beautiful all right and on YouTube
200:53 - guys I know you guys are killing it as
200:55 - well it's a lot of fun all right so we
200:58 - got that portion we got this
201:01 - I like it I like it like that
201:05 - okay anyways all right
201:08 - um so now next portion is going to be
201:10 - the image slider which is gonna be oh
201:13 - this is gonna be so much fun you guys
201:15 - are you ready for the image slider
201:17 - oh that sucks it's gonna be a fun one
201:19 - it's gonna be a fun one because I know
201:20 - you guys will be confused
201:23 - that's why that's why exactly why so but
201:26 - it's okay we'll we'll do this together
201:28 - don't worry about that so image slider
201:31 - so what are we going to use for this
201:32 - image lab well the first thing to do is
201:34 - we need to create the actual component
201:35 - so let's go ahead and do inside the
201:36 - components folder right click new file
201:38 - and we'll say what we'll say image
201:41 - image
201:43 - slider dot JS done all right let's do
201:47 - rfce to create our component all right
201:49 - and we'll say image slider here
201:54 - all right save that beautiful image
201:56 - slider and of course it's not here
201:58 - because we need to import it so let's go
202:00 - back to our home.js which is right here
202:03 - and let's import that right just how we
202:05 - always import we like to import so
202:06 - import
202:08 - what image image
202:10 - slider
202:12 - from what from
202:15 - from going to be from what is it guys
202:17 - what is it component what what is it
202:21 - well directly from here because our
202:23 - image slider is inside this folder
202:25 - components folder and our home page
202:26 - inside this folder so we'll say dot dash
202:28 - image slider
202:30 - save that let's go and create the
202:32 - component side here now so say image
202:34 - slider
202:36 - done all right
202:38 - boom image slide is right here all right
202:41 - so that's pretty good I'm pretty happy
202:43 - about that how that's turning out all
202:44 - right
202:45 - it's really really good actually I like
202:47 - that a lot all right so that's really
202:49 - cool so and now let's actually work
202:52 - inside the image slider let's go into
202:55 - here
202:56 - boom now we're inside here
202:58 - okay
203:00 - all right
203:01 - inside here a few things we need to do
203:03 - what we're going to use to do to do
203:05 - image slider is something called react
203:07 - slick check this out
203:10 - sorry let me get some water I'm dying
203:14 - out here
203:19 - oh yeah you know you guys don't
203:21 - want me to die right I hope so I hope
203:23 - not
203:25 - all right so there we go so it's called
203:28 - the react slick and it will give you
203:29 - some examples here
203:31 - but basically it's a react module that's
203:33 - been built for us to make beautiful
203:35 - sliders so right here reacts the
203:37 - documentation
203:38 - right there boom see you right there and
203:41 - this looks pretty much exactly the same
203:42 - as what we're trying to build and
203:43 - actually tells us how we need to build
203:45 - this there's a settings there's a
203:47 - component right here there's settings we
203:48 - need to give it and then we just return
203:50 - the div you can see we will use the
203:52 - slider component that's this one
203:55 - right that's like opponent and then
203:56 - we'll use it where we'll use it inside
203:58 - here right there
204:02 - right so that's how we need to do so the
204:03 - first thing for you to do is we need to
204:05 - install image slider and well to make
204:07 - that happens go back to here
204:09 - react slick all right
204:13 - all right so okay so npm install reacts
204:18 - like dash dash say let's go and copy
204:19 - that all right let's open up our
204:21 - terminal which we like to do by right
204:23 - clicking and then open an integrate
204:25 - terminal no problem right click on
204:26 - package.json or whatever you have to
204:28 - click right click on let's open up this
204:30 - okay so do npm install react slick dash
204:34 - dash save
204:35 - done hit enter okay that will install
204:38 - the react select module for you okay
204:39 - done that's all good we're not done yet
204:42 - though but now we need to do npm install
204:43 - slick Carousel this will install us the
204:46 - CSS we need to use so next one is going
204:48 - to be npm install slick here so that's
204:51 - next one
204:52 - and enter
204:54 - and look at this guys it literally has
204:57 - 746
204:59 - 000 weekly downloads this tells me that
205:02 - this is a good module to download no
205:05 - good no mods not good module to download
205:07 - basically it's very well supported
205:09 - that's what that tells me okay
205:11 - okay now what we do is we need to now
205:14 - import these CSS files here
205:16 - okay and need to import of course import
205:19 - the actual uh the actual as well slider
205:22 - so let's do that
205:24 - so here we'll say import import
205:29 - slider
205:30 - from
205:33 - react Dash slick
205:35 - fast slick all right save that right and
205:39 - then we'll do the following we'll save
205:40 - here
205:42 - or say lat settings
205:45 - ah don't let's not do that just yet
205:47 - actually I'll do that just yet get that
205:49 - for a second here and then we need to
205:50 - import the CSS files right here Imports
205:52 - like carousel right here so these ones
205:54 - are really really important so import
205:56 - and hopefully a monthly where you guys
205:58 - can take care of it maybe you guys can
205:59 - put in the chat something keep putting a
206:00 - chat hopefully uh Imports like carousels
206:02 - looks like that CSS right there that's
206:04 - the one that we need to use okay
206:06 - all right save that beautiful and we're
206:09 - not done yet so now at this point let's
206:11 - go ahead and use style components as
206:13 - well so let's go ahead and import style
206:14 - components of course we're we're
206:16 - currently here
206:18 - okay
206:20 - there so let's go ahead and do import
206:22 - style components
206:25 - import styled import styled
206:30 - styled from
206:32 - from what styled Dash components done
206:37 - stylish components
206:39 - all right so that's that's good and
206:41 - instead of doing uh div we're going to
206:43 - say carousel so command D just like both
206:46 - carousel
206:47 - done and let's create that stock
206:50 - component we'll say const carousel
206:53 - is equal to what not style that they
206:57 - have actually
206:58 - but check this out remember how we had
207:00 - to use slider remember how inside here
207:03 - we had to use slider component you see
207:06 - which came directly from here remember
207:08 - that
207:09 - well
207:10 - watch this
207:12 - I'm going to say styled slider
207:17 - basically instead of doing slider inside
207:20 - directly inside here
207:22 - I'm giving it a style component because
207:25 - then I can actually style it myself
207:27 - right that's the whole reason why
207:30 - that's the cool part about this so
207:32 - slider okay so that's there uh
207:35 - everything's gone everything's deleted
207:37 - that's okay don't worry there's a reason
207:39 - for it probably I know 100
207:41 - hopefully I think it's because the fact
207:44 - that we import a slider and we have not
207:46 - given it any uh settings yet so don't
207:48 - worry about that so let's go ahead and
207:49 - quit some settings and we'll do let
207:51 - settings
207:53 - equals the following and there's a few
207:56 - times we can set there's like dots you
207:58 - know infinite true speed and so forth
208:00 - and first dots so that's the dots that
208:02 - will show up at the bottom so we'll say
208:03 - dots that's going to be true
208:06 - comma they will say infinite that's true
208:09 - basically you will infinitely should be
208:11 - able to infinite
208:14 - infinite that's going to be true as well
208:18 - all right then speed
208:20 - is going to be 500 that's 500
208:22 - milliseconds that's basically half a
208:24 - second okay slides to show one
208:28 - to show
208:30 - ah my bad it's gonna be one
208:34 - comma and then we're going to do uh
208:39 - uh slice to scroll how many slices go
208:42 - for scroll biscuit slides to scroll
208:47 - is going to be one as well okay an auto
208:51 - uh Auto
208:53 - play
208:54 - is going to be true
208:58 - boom so this is our settings okay I'll
209:01 - place it with the true let's get the
209:02 - things now to here now the way we do
209:04 - that is using something this is called
209:06 - destructuring you see how they do it
209:08 - here it's called destructuring that's
209:10 - what that that's what that does so say
209:12 - dot dot dot dot settings basically it's
209:15 - put it puts in basically all of these
209:19 - all of these settings directly into the
209:22 - carousel div as a as a basically as a
209:24 - what's it called a
209:27 - so save that why is my thing not working
209:30 - that's interesting right click it
209:32 - inspect almond where's my header where's
209:34 - everything it's not it's not there at
209:36 - all the help
209:39 - Carousel they're just going nuts on me
209:43 - let's go and Spike down below here
209:45 - body the root
209:48 - oh there's something happening here it's
209:49 - very interesting
209:50 - some they fail which are like oh
209:54 - slider
209:56 - but we are recording the div component
210:00 - type is invalid expect the string for
210:03 - built-in components of a class function
210:05 - react Dom
210:06 - defined but you likely forget to export
210:08 - your component from the file it's
210:09 - defined in or you might have mixed up a
210:11 - default or name view okay Imports
210:13 - interesting style import slider
210:17 - die right through rightly
210:20 - let me see slider import slider from
210:22 - Carousel slick
210:24 - see
210:25 - import slider
210:28 - make sure it's all good guys and on
210:30 - YouTube you guys have the same and you
210:32 - guys have the same issue
210:33 - is it just me
210:35 - maybe it's just me
210:38 - it's okay we'll be able to solve
210:40 - anything we put on mine too
210:42 - correct cons Carousel that's fine that's
210:45 - all good we imported it correctly which
210:48 - is correct right maybe it's because we
210:51 - need to have an actual div inside here
210:52 - let's try let's see this let me let me
210:54 - try this let me try this for a second
210:56 - okay
210:59 - boom
211:01 - let me try this for a second here
211:05 - one second I'm gonna do the rap as a
211:07 - style that div don't worry about it
211:08 - don't worry don't worry I got you guys
211:10 - so const wrap
211:14 - is equal to style dot div
211:19 - okay let's see okay so all right so the
211:22 - reason why it wasn't working looks like
211:24 - is all right so oh I know I know it's
211:28 - fine don't worry about it it's gonna fit
211:29 - your fix okay so the reason why it's
211:31 - working because when we put it into the
211:32 - slider right there's literally nothing
211:34 - here right there was nothing to slide
211:36 - and so it gives us errors right because
211:38 - it probably expects us to have some kind
211:40 - of a slider right it's some kind of uh
211:42 - the actual image inside here because if
211:44 - you look at here right
211:46 - we need to give it a div right a div to
211:49 - slide through so day of H1 or H3
211:51 - whatever might be right and so we're
211:53 - doing here is we're kind of did well to
211:54 - create a div what we're going to do is
211:56 - the following so let's go back to here
211:57 - right again it's going to be not going
212:00 - to work but we're going to create a wrap
212:02 - here a raptive so that's going to be
212:04 - it's just a normal div going to be a
212:06 - style component what should we create
212:07 - inside here constrap style.div okay
212:11 - then inside here we're going to create
212:13 - an image that's the images we were going
212:15 - to uh now that's going to show up
212:17 - basically so do the following so we'll
212:19 - say image here
212:20 - say image and we'll say source is equal
212:23 - to the following okay there's going to
212:25 - be Dash images
212:28 - Dash slider
212:33 - slider Dash badging
212:38 - that jpeg there you go and close it out
212:42 - all right so good that's image one and
212:46 - now I'm going to get another image let's
212:48 - go ahead and do another image
212:50 - there we go now we have ourselves a
212:53 - slider right I know it looks horrible I
212:55 - know it's like
212:57 - bad boom very bad right now would you
213:01 - think that's bad right right raise your
213:03 - hand that's that's bad right that's
213:04 - pretty bad yeah I'll agree with that
213:06 - yeah you guys want to make it better
213:07 - shall we make it better yeah she'll make
213:09 - it better I think so
213:10 - I think so all right
213:14 - uh this pretty much just requires a a
213:16 - little bit of CSS that's that's pretty
213:18 - much all it does it all requires okay
213:20 - um so let's go ahead and actually look
213:21 - at our CSS here I'm gonna put this here
213:24 - uh boom right here
213:27 - wrote that here
213:30 - all right so we're gonna focus on the
213:33 - curious so here let's do a margin top
213:34 - here for a second so margin top
213:37 - so margin Dash top
213:39 - is going to be 20 pixels
213:42 - boom
213:43 - all right that's gonna basically push a
213:45 - little bit oh they'll just go away the
213:46 - hell
213:47 - oh no this happened so save that
213:50 - so it pushes the slider over to the
213:51 - bottom which that's what I like to do
213:52 - that's what I kind of like right so I
213:54 - kind of wanted to put a little bit more
213:55 - to the towards the bottom okay all right
213:58 - okay all right awesome sweet so that's
214:01 - that all right and then what I want to
214:03 - do is well
214:05 - a few things
214:07 - um let's focus on the wrap here for a
214:08 - second here okay this wrap
214:10 - let's look at this image
214:13 - okay image let's focus on this image
214:16 - [Music]
214:17 - and with this image let's give the width
214:22 - width of a hundred percent
214:27 - and a height of a hundred percent
214:31 - okay boom right there see done so 100
214:35 - and now it's a lot lot better would you
214:39 - give me that one I would say so
214:42 - um next up for this one let's change
214:44 - this one to not be slider badging let's
214:46 - change it to be slider b b a badag
214:52 - but that that's actually inside the
214:53 - images folder but dag the jpeg
214:55 - all right establish we have now two
214:57 - different images you see right there but
214:59 - dag but that's funny
215:01 - but Doug
215:03 - that's funny all right on the image side
215:06 - um a few things I want to give it a
215:07 - little bit of a curvature here so let's
215:09 - do the following so a little bit of a
215:11 - curvature uh we're gonna do the
215:13 - following so I'm gonna say image and I'm
215:14 - gonna say border radius okay border
215:17 - radius
215:18 - board Dash radius
215:21 - radius of 4 pixels
215:23 - it's going to curve a little bit of that
215:26 - of that kind of like this image a little
215:27 - bit maybe you see it you see right there
215:29 - maybe you see that right there see that
215:31 - you see how it curve is it a little bit
215:33 - I see that curls are just a little bit
215:34 - right there
215:36 - just right there okay
215:38 - okay then I'm going to give it a box
215:40 - Shadow now I want you guys to copy this
215:42 - one okay this box shadow
215:44 - check this out
215:46 - okay right there so RGB biscuit that's
215:48 - basically where the color it's coming
215:49 - from to the character where it's going
215:51 - so it's very simple right RGB right here
215:53 - maybe uh David Romano maybe you guys can
215:55 - put in this box Shadow for everybody in
215:57 - the comments below is 0.6 pixel 30 30
215:59 - pixels minus 10 pixels maybe you guys
216:01 - you can put it it's basically just a box
216:03 - Shadow style that's all it is
216:06 - now I know it looks horrible right now
216:09 - it looks horrible now don't worry don't
216:11 - you worry at all okay so back shadow
216:15 - look at that oh that looks so good it
216:18 - looks so good all right I mean actually
216:20 - does not look good I'm sorry
216:21 - [Music]
216:24 - um does not look good at all actually so
216:26 - the reason why it does not look good at
216:28 - all because inside this right here this
216:31 - slick component it's called slick
216:33 - component we call it
216:35 - um we don't you see how in reality we're
216:38 - supposed to see all these other images
216:39 - you see all these other images on the
216:41 - right hand side and the left hand side
216:42 - you see that but we don't see that
216:44 - the reason being is because there's no
216:47 - overflow hidden on this dip
216:50 - overflow and biscuit on any overflow it
216:53 - hides the rest so to prevent that what
216:56 - we're going to do is the following so
216:57 - I'm going to say inside the carousel I'm
217:00 - going to Target the Slick list
217:02 - select Dash list
217:05 - and here I'm going to say overflow
217:09 - visible
217:12 - boom holy that made a big
217:15 - difference you see
217:17 - just like that look see overflow visible
217:19 - to overflow hidden right so before
217:22 - initially it was hidden by default that
217:25 - was inside their CSS that would they
217:26 - that they gave you
217:28 - see now it's visible
217:31 - visible
217:33 - visible
217:34 - done
217:35 - now it's visible
217:37 - okay
217:39 - right there so that's gonna be that but
217:41 - they're awesome sweet sweet sweet sweet
217:42 - sweet sweet oh that looks so good
217:46 - okay it looks so good look at that oh
217:48 - that's so
217:49 - guys how cool is that raise your hand
217:51 - with me if you're still with me yes yes
217:53 - yes everybody everybody
217:56 - beautiful I like it it's looking so good
218:00 - we're making such good progress I love
218:01 - it all right so that's overflow visible
218:04 - and then what we're going to do is a few
218:07 - things I'm I need to change up to make
218:08 - it even better okay let's give a small
218:10 - border uh so get a border I'm gonna say
218:13 - border four pixels here on this image
218:15 - I'm gonna say border 4 pixels
218:18 - solid
218:20 - right transparent now what does that
218:22 - mean transparent is the color
218:25 - you see it adds a small like just
218:27 - transparent color
218:29 - now again right here it's kind of like
218:31 - right here and don't worry we'll fix it
218:33 - kind of how it looks like again it looks
218:35 - a little bit odd right here I know don't
218:37 - worry about it we'll fix that in a
218:38 - second here
218:39 - I'll fix that a second here so it's
218:40 - gonna be a transparent border right
218:43 - um next thing
218:45 - let's do the following here
218:48 - um on the Carousel and the carousel so
218:51 - we have slick list and then we're going
218:53 - to add a color white on all these active
218:56 - buttons right so let's do the following
218:57 - to do that I'm going to say Li dot slick
219:02 - active so when there's an active button
219:05 - active
219:06 - button
219:08 - before right now how does this work out
219:10 - I will show you in a little bit here for
219:12 - a second here and I'm going to say color
219:14 - white
219:17 - white okay
219:21 - Ally it's like that's actually inside
219:23 - let me see the carousel
219:28 - okay I'm also going to do the following
219:30 - so I'm gonna say on every single button
219:32 - right here I'm gonna say UL
219:34 - Li button these are the basically the
219:37 - the next button
219:39 - right here and I'm gonna say like this
219:42 - before
219:46 - I'm gonna say here font size
219:51 - let's say font size I'm gonna increase
219:53 - the fonts decrease fans are just a
219:55 - little bit so font size 10 pixels right
219:57 - there okay I'm gonna say give it a color
220:00 - I mean you can be cool it can be just a
220:03 - white color
220:04 - right there so these buttons are here
220:06 - see
220:08 - see
220:09 - boom all right so but I'm gonna give
220:11 - this a more gentle color I don't like
220:13 - that actually too much
220:18 - I like this color right here
220:20 - this guy's a little more gentler I kind
220:21 - of like that a little a little better a
220:23 - little better
220:25 - okay
220:26 - so that's kind of that color white uh
220:29 - same thing with
220:30 - right there oh you see how it has like
220:33 - this white more of a more of a white
220:35 - look when on the active on the active
220:36 - button you see that right there
220:38 - see right there beautiful all right now
220:41 - you see how we have the next button but
220:43 - we don't have the previous button the
220:44 - reason why why is because of the Z index
220:47 - so if I do button here
220:49 - and I give it a z index of one
220:53 - a one
220:55 - check this out
220:57 - oh let's go you see right there that my
221:01 - friends is basically what we need right
221:04 - so that's that's pretty much that I'm
221:06 - going to zoom in on this let me see how
221:07 - does this look like what are you guys
221:09 - think so far
221:10 - it's working pretty good I think so too
221:13 - I think so too I like it I like it I
221:16 - like it I like it I like it like that
221:17 - all right that's looking pretty good I
221:20 - like the way it's going oh my God not
221:22 - save this I don't want that
221:24 - that's pretty pretty good and then the
221:27 - next thing we need to do is to make it
221:29 - work a little bit better is is the
221:32 - following so so check this out you see
221:35 - how here
221:36 - you see how that's like this border is
221:38 - within this image you see it's like a
221:40 - little bit better right that's kind of
221:42 - how I like it a lot better so what we'll
221:44 - do is this is called because of box
221:46 - sizing it's it's a bit a little weird
221:48 - but I want you guys to understand this a
221:50 - little bit here
221:51 - um it's all because of box signing
221:52 - border box so
221:54 - you see how these borders are on the
221:57 - outside here on the outside well to make
222:01 - them on the inside to make the biscuit
222:03 - included part of the whole image I'm
222:06 - going to go to app.css and I'm going to
222:08 - say everything that you have
222:11 - oops
222:12 - oops
222:13 - oops oops
222:15 - they have box size and board box save
222:17 - that boom see big difference look at
222:20 - that you see
222:21 - now what happens with this is basically
222:24 - it's telling for example uh border box
222:27 - when I say border box is 10 hit the
222:29 - content should contain the Border itself
222:31 - basically the width contains the Border
222:34 - that's what that means right and so
222:36 - that's way when I say with 100 right the
222:39 - width actually is contained within the
222:41 - Border that's what that means right
222:43 - that's what we can see the border which
222:44 - is much much better now and I like that
222:46 - a lot better honestly
222:47 - yeah oh let's go look at how good that
222:50 - looks guys that looks so so good
222:53 - oh my God it makes me happy
222:56 - all right let's go back to home.js let's
222:57 - go to image slider back to here we're
222:59 - not done yet we're almost done but not
223:01 - done yet almost there but we're not
223:03 - there we're so close but we're not there
223:06 - yet let's go
223:08 - uh the next thing
223:10 - um
223:11 - I want to give it a small hover effect
223:13 - so what do I mean by that on the hover
223:16 - of the image fully I want to change the
223:18 - small a few small things I'm going to be
223:20 - in here
223:21 - okay so I'm going to say hover
223:24 - I want to say hover
223:27 - hover and I'm gonna change the color the
223:30 - color of the board to be white so I'm
223:31 - gonna say border
223:33 - is going to be 4 pixels solid
223:36 - solid but this time the Border color is
223:40 - going to be this one
223:41 - right here
223:43 - oh we see this rgba 249 so it's almost
223:45 - like a white color with a little bit of
223:47 - transparency
223:48 - and then
223:49 - save that
223:51 - let's see
223:52 - oh let's go look at that right there see
223:55 - okay next thing let's give it a cursor
223:57 - point to the wrap
224:00 - cursor
224:02 - cursor pointer
224:04 - the wrap
224:06 - okay so when I hover it's like actually
224:08 - like a it's actually like a cursor right
224:09 - here you see it's good beautiful and
224:11 - then the last is give it a transition so
224:13 - the transition rate should be transition
224:15 - let's give it extra transition so we'll
224:17 - say transition duration
224:20 - [Music]
224:21 - oh look at that so much better you guys
224:25 - so so so much better that's so much
224:28 - better what do you guys think huh
224:30 - what do you guys think Hmm I like that
224:34 - so much better
224:36 - uh I need to fix this brush over here
224:37 - see this before I should be before in
224:40 - here
224:41 - okay
224:42 - there's the color white I'll refresh
224:44 - this oh let's go whoo
224:48 - beautiful beautiful
224:50 - and guys we have made ourselves a
224:54 - a carousel that's it the carousel is
224:57 - right there now you'll be wondering I
224:59 - want to ask you questions I may have a
225:00 - question do you raise your hand if you
225:02 - think you wanna you're wondering like
225:03 - how the heck does this work
225:06 - like imagine if you wonder how the hell
225:08 - does this work okay good so look so
225:11 - because this is actually part of this is
225:14 - within the actual what's it called This
225:16 - is within um
225:18 - um what am I say oh yeah we also need to
225:20 - fix this portion I need to fix this
225:22 - don't worry we'll fix this I got it
225:25 - we'll play this in a second okay here so
225:28 - if I right click on this
225:30 - inspect element
225:32 - let me put this here a little bit to the
225:34 - bottom here
225:36 - okay I'm gonna put it here uh this is
225:38 - the button here you see button see this
225:40 - button so what's gonna happen we have
225:42 - this you see here look align slick
225:44 - active so automatically basically
225:46 - JavaScript underneath the hood is adding
225:48 - a slick active class you see this to
225:51 - this Li bone forces here then it goes to
225:54 - here and so we're doing here we're
225:56 - targeting a CSS class called called Li
225:59 - slick active right there and then we're
226:02 - targeting the button now look at this
226:04 - see there's buttons you see this so
226:06 - button
226:07 - okay let me let me let me do auto play
226:10 - false for now so this stops here
226:13 - okay so it stops moving around right so
226:17 - you see here
226:18 - right there so button here
226:21 - so now this is a select active here I'm
226:23 - gonna say button and look
226:26 - before you see so a line slick active a
226:30 - button before and we've done this
226:33 - actually is done through the slit
226:34 - Carousel module right they do this
226:36 - themselves and look at that this before
226:39 - button has a color black
226:42 - what we did we said no make it color
226:45 - white
226:46 - that's what we did we overwrote
226:48 - overwrote the natural natural CSS that
226:52 - comes with react slick do you understand
226:55 - that raise your hand if you understand
226:56 - it with me yes do you see what I'm
226:59 - talking about do you see what I'm
227:00 - talking about yes we overwrote it
227:02 - but because by default by default the
227:05 - Slick active if you go to Slick active
227:07 - you go to that button they go to before
227:09 - so you select active button before by
227:12 - default it's just color black
227:14 - see here that's the default CSS that
227:17 - comes with the slick theme which is this
227:19 - one right here you see with this like
227:20 - theme CSS but we said no no no no no no
227:23 - no no no no no no no no no no no no no
227:25 - no no no no no no no no no no no no no
227:26 - we're gonna change ourselves that's what
227:28 - happened here

227:42 - too all right well that's honestly
227:43 - that's not that bad to fix so what we do
227:46 - is we need to go to actually index.css
227:48 - Js
227:49 - [Music]
227:53 - let's go home.js and all you need to do
227:55 - on the home.js is just say overflow
227:57 - hidden that's it so overflow
228:01 - here overflow
228:03 - inside the hollow.js Overflow Dash X

231:25 - that looks sick okay boom all right so
231:29 - that's that one and of course now if we
231:32 - go ahead to our racked app boom we have
231:34 - viewers right here you see of course
231:35 - that's not what we want to do but that's
231:37 - what we got so far understand comprende
231:39 - all good good
231:41 - all right let's now work inside the
231:43 - viewers.js file which is going to be
231:45 - pretty pretty simple it's not gonna be
231:46 - it's not gonna be anything too crazy or
231:47 - anything in terms of CSS uh you just
231:49 - learn some stuff so let's go ahead and
231:51 - do import style you know the drill guys
231:52 - import styled styled
231:55 - from what from stock components
232:00 - styled Dash components
232:03 - components save that awesome okay and
232:07 - let's go ahead and create the container
232:11 - oh
232:13 - oh
232:14 - container and let's go and create the
232:16 - the container component so I'll say
232:18 - container here so const
232:20 - const container is equal to styled dot
232:23 - div
232:25 - the div Denzel
232:28 - done Zone okay
232:29 - simple so all right now let's go ahead
232:32 - and do the following uh let's do at this
232:35 - point let's give us a padding for us so
232:37 - the container let's do padding
232:40 - padding
232:41 - let's do some stuff let's do container
232:43 - padding zero zero 26 pixels and what is
232:47 - this actually on about what is this 26
232:49 - pixels well if I go ahead and take a
232:50 - look at this here
232:52 - let's go and say this right click
232:53 - viewers
232:57 - come on
233:02 - good
233:03 - okay so this one here
233:06 - right there so 26 pixels means literally
233:08 - petting bottom 26 pixels that's the
233:12 - shortcut for this one right pending
233:13 - bottom 26 pixels that's what that means
233:16 - okay all right now okay so that's all
233:18 - good that's so good now let's go ahead
233:20 - and take a look at what we're going to
233:21 - put in here well this one is going to
233:23 - have a few things inside inside here
233:25 - actually no I need to be inside here
233:27 - container no actually it's not depending
233:30 - but my bad hold on that's not right hold
233:32 - on so this is right here
233:33 - actually let's do margin top my bad
233:35 - margin Dash top
233:38 - margin top and we'll say 30 pixels here
233:41 - okay that makes more sense right 30
233:43 - pixels that push-up pushes and more to
233:45 - the bottom
233:46 - um let's do the following now let's do
233:48 - um
233:50 - display grid so this would be really
233:53 - interesting now we're gonna go into grid
233:55 - now now what is this grid raise your
233:56 - hand if you know what grid is anybody
233:58 - know what grid is what is Grid or just
234:01 - yeah so what is grid so grid is
234:03 - basically it's kind of like Flex but it
234:05 - allows us to be very discreet it's like
234:07 - a it's it's a it's basically like a uh
234:11 - you know Flex on steroids that's what
234:12 - I'll call it you know that's what I'll
234:15 - call it and
234:16 - we'll give it a grid
234:18 - and we'll say here we'll say
234:21 - grid
234:23 - template columns so we'll have three so
234:26 - we have Falcon with template
234:28 - template columns
234:30 - columns
234:32 - and with query template columns well
234:35 - actually hey there before we do that let
234:37 - me go ahead and come with this portion
234:38 - out just so I can show it to you inside
234:39 - the container of course we do we need to
234:41 - have all these images right so we need
234:43 - to create the web so I'm going to say
234:44 - create wrap wrap for this one
234:47 - rap right so every single thing is going
234:51 - to be a wrap so this is gonna be your
234:52 - wrap that's gonna be a wrap it's gonna
234:54 - be individual dips right here that's
234:55 - what these are okay understand
234:56 - comprending good
234:58 - right wrap and every single rapper will
235:00 - have an image so it's an image
235:02 - image and we'll say source is equal to
235:05 - and it's going to be this one this is
235:07 - the image right here so hopefully maybe
235:09 - you guys see you guys know where to get
235:11 - it or maybe a month they can help you
235:13 - guys out and actually give you guys the
235:14 - image okay so images
235:16 - viewers Disney
235:18 - rap is undefined and we're able to find
235:20 - it right now so it's a const const wrap
235:23 - is equal to styled dot div
235:30 - that's what it's equal to okay
235:34 - Okay so style.div boom right there
235:37 - that's amazing okay and oh my God it
235:40 - looks so bad don't worry about it so
235:42 - let's go ahead and create a few of them
235:44 - okay so let's go ahead and do actually
235:45 - create five of them
235:47 - oh my God it looks so bad but two three
235:50 - four five okay
235:53 - all righty let's go look at this it
235:56 - looks horrible
235:56 - [Music]
235:58 - I know it's okay don't worry about it so
236:00 - now to fix that that's where Grizz gonna
236:03 - come in so let's go try this out so with
236:06 - grid and I'm gonna give it columns now
236:07 - so look at this great typical columns
236:09 - I'm going to say repeat
236:12 - so what this says create five columns so
236:15 - five
236:16 - comma min max and what this does is
236:20 - basically gives it a whip basically what
236:21 - is it what we should use well a minimum
236:23 - is zero basically about the 1fr simply
236:25 - means stretch it out as much as possible
236:27 - basically that's what one of our stands
236:29 - for
236:30 - okay
236:32 - boom all right okay now it's kind of
236:35 - like in line but it still looks horrible
236:37 - uh and so that's already to actually go
236:39 - to the wrap and actually fix that right
236:41 - because technically we have five grids
236:44 - if you look at it right look see one see
236:48 - five grits one two three four five you
236:51 - see it's there it's just a Disney the
236:53 - images are actually overflowing that's
236:54 - what's got going on right here so to fix
236:57 - that if we go to wrap and we'll say here
236:58 - image
237:00 - right I'm going to say a width of 100 so
237:03 - basically the image should take up 100
237:05 - 100 percent
237:07 - done okay oh boom right there awesome
237:10 - sweet right so I'm then going to say I'm
237:13 - going to say height of those 100 simply
237:15 - height 100 percent
237:17 - boom right then I'm gonna say object fit
237:21 - so rjfit means hey fit up the object as
237:23 - much as possible so object fit cover so
237:25 - fitted the image as much as possible
237:28 - inside this div awesome
237:31 - and that's honestly pretty much it now
237:33 - for this wrap let's give it some stuff
237:35 - let's give this this so we'll say here
237:37 - uh border let's give it a border and the
237:39 - Border will be look like a little bit
237:41 - like this kind of it's a very light
237:42 - border
237:43 - look three pixel solid
237:46 - rgba that's the RGB I want you guys to
237:48 - use right 249 249 and 0.1 so guys it's a
237:51 - very light border let's go save that
237:54 - Okay order is it not showing up
237:57 - let's see
237:59 - not sure not but just completely okay
238:03 - border oh that didn't real right we have
238:05 - border
238:06 - let's see border zero pixels oh solid
238:09 - solid right there awesome so that looks
238:12 - great so we have one two three four five
238:16 - things that we have okay now of course
238:18 - let's add some border radius to this one
238:20 - I'm gonna say border radius
238:22 - border Dash radius
238:24 - radius and let's give it a 10 pixel
238:26 - radius
238:27 - nice oh looks so much better now now it
238:31 - still looks pretty bad I don't like it
238:32 - did you guys agree with me this would
238:34 - you guys agree that it needs some
238:36 - spacing in between like in between every
238:37 - single column would you guys agree with
238:39 - me in that one should we add some
238:41 - spacing yeah beautiful all right
238:43 - beautiful so to do that we're gonna use
238:46 - a gap
238:47 - we're going to use something called Gap
238:48 - so check this out
238:50 - okay let's use grid Gap grid Dash Gap
238:56 - and I will say 25 pixels
238:59 - boom
239:00 - oh look at that so grid Gap is a very
239:04 - useful tool okay it's a very useful way
239:08 - to add a gap between every single grid
239:10 - item
239:12 - oh boom see so simple so simple right
239:15 - and now let's go ahead maybe add some uh
239:19 - let's get add some padding inside this
239:22 - container so we'll say padding
239:24 - let's say 30 pixels
239:27 - zero
239:28 - then we'll say 26 pixels
239:33 - boom so push it over the bottom so
239:34 - basically if you inspect down but on
239:36 - this one if I go ahead and go look at
239:38 - this specific padding you see this
239:40 - literally just means it's very simple
239:42 - padding top is 30 pixels petting your
239:44 - right is zero putting left to zero and
239:46 - then painting bottom is 26 but this is
239:48 - means Top This is bottom this right here
239:51 - stands for left and right that's what
239:53 - that means okay all right beautiful
239:56 - all right so that's that now let's go
239:59 - ahead and give it a box shadow
240:01 - okay I'm gonna get a box shot it looks a
240:04 - little bit kind of like this
240:06 - right there so again you can copy this
240:09 - as well hopefully maybe uh David and
240:11 - them can put it for you guys in the
240:13 - comments or maybe he'll push you guys in
240:15 - the comments in there there's a bachelor
240:16 - just kind of copy it for yourself here
240:19 - all right so that's that so it gives it
240:21 - you see that gives it that boxer which
240:22 - is really good by the way which looks so
240:23 - good which I like a lot actually it's a
240:25 - very light back Shadow okay and then
240:28 - let's do an hover effect so on the hover
240:30 - I actually want to make it bigger so
240:31 - let's do on the hover
240:34 - now by the way
240:36 - do you know what this does what does
240:39 - this do do I might raise your hand if
240:40 - you know what this does
240:41 - raise your hand if you don't know what
240:43 - this does
240:45 - so this actually basically concatenates
240:48 - the hover to the parent which is the
240:51 - wrap
240:52 - it's kind of like doing it's kind of
240:53 - like doing for example wrap wrap
240:57 - hover that's what it's doing so
240:59 - basically this is concatenating hover to
241:02 - the wrap that's what it's doing just so
241:04 - you guys know okay
241:06 - all right on the hover let's go and
241:09 - change up the temperature let's do scale
241:12 - it so let's go ahead and scale it in the
241:13 - X and Y Direction so transform scale so
241:16 - scale just simply means make it bigger
241:17 - okay and then we'll change the Border
241:19 - color to be a little more different as
241:21 - well
241:22 - yes
241:23 - boom okay so now if I say this boom you
241:27 - see it's a little bit different now but
241:29 - of course we can make it better let's
241:30 - add a cursive point in this one
241:34 - cursor pointer
241:36 - pointer save that okay now now to cursor
241:40 - pointer which I like a lot awesome sweet
241:42 - God it looks so good guys it looks so
241:44 - awesome I love it all right that's
241:46 - cursor pointer and then what I want to
241:48 - do is I want to go ahead and change up
241:50 - the box Shadow here as well just a
241:53 - little bit
241:54 - foreign
241:59 - box just a little bit here not not not
242:01 - too much so it becomes a big it becomes
242:04 - a bigger box Shadow but to make this
242:06 - actually cleaner we're going to give it
242:08 - a transition
242:10 - boom so this is transition everything
242:13 - with two by the way this number remember
242:17 - this number I want you guys to remember
242:18 - this this is a big number here this
242:20 - number is actually used in a lot of
242:22 - transitions this is if you if you give
242:24 - it to if you give it a number higher
242:26 - than this it became becomes too slow if
242:29 - you give it a number less than this it
242:31 - becomes sometimes too fast so actually
242:33 - this number is actually used by a lot of
242:35 - developers this number 250 milliseconds
242:37 - so just keep this one in mind okay
242:39 - and this is the choose that you want to
242:41 - use right here cubic bizire desire all
242:45 - right save that and look now look at
242:47 - this you guys ready for this you guys
242:48 - ready

243:16 - much that for you so look we finished
243:19 - the views but of course let's go ahead
243:20 - and change up these images so they're a
243:21 - little bit better

244:48 - focus on
244:49 - okay uh let's do that so let's go ahead
244:52 - and go to our vs code here let's do add
244:56 - again I want you guys to understand this
244:57 - one so add viewers
245:00 - right here let's go and add this to git
245:02 - commit
245:03 - again hopefully you guys used your git
245:06 - commit properly
245:08 - all right all right so let's go ahead
245:10 - and uh create new component let's do
245:12 - this one should be called uh movies
245:16 - Dot movies.js
245:19 - all right so rfce you know the drill
245:22 - okay
245:24 - boom create the movies let's call it
245:27 - movies
245:28 - movies awesome sweet so that's going to
245:32 - be a movie here
245:33 - all right so that's movies here all
245:35 - right save that and let's go now to uh
245:39 - let's import this into the home page
245:41 - okay so let's do back to the home page
245:44 - by the home page and let's import it so
245:47 - we'll say import
245:51 - um movies
245:52 - from what from movies
245:57 - all right that's the next one we're
245:59 - gonna create right right there and let's
246:01 - go ahead and use that one so we'll say
246:02 - movies here
246:05 - okay beautiful beautiful beautiful
246:07 - movies all right sweet I like it all
246:10 - right so I like it like that um
246:14 - that's amazing
246:17 - okay so just like music right here so
246:19 - movies that's all good let's go ahead
246:21 - and go now to the movies let's focus on
246:22 - that one so let's go ahead and save this
246:24 - and boom now we have we can see we have
246:26 - the moves right here so we create a
246:28 - component that's exactly what we need to
246:30 - do all right now this component is gonna
246:32 - be again not that hard of a component as
246:34 - well
246:35 - um let's go ahead and do our normal
246:36 - thing we'd like to do which is import
246:38 - style so I'm going to use style
246:39 - components of course import Stout from
246:42 - where import styled from
246:44 - from style Dash components
246:48 - stylish components components okay and
246:52 - then instead of doing return dip we'll
246:54 - do containers so we'll say
246:57 - container
246:58 - let's go all right at the bottom we have
247:01 - const container so let's do the
247:03 - following const container is equal to
247:06 - what styled
247:08 - dot dip
247:14 - okay
247:17 - okay so that's good all right nothing
247:19 - too crazy here uh let's get a little bit
247:21 - of padding here and this Penny what do
247:22 - you guys think this this penny is gonna
247:23 - be bottom padding so don't worry about
247:24 - so much about that one right all right
247:26 - uh next one is let's do H4 so we'll do
247:29 - an H4 here
247:30 - H4 let's do so this is gonna be a H4
247:34 - heading let's do here recommend
247:38 - recommended
247:40 - for you
247:44 - oh no that's not what I want save that
247:47 - oh let's go that's beautiful it looks
247:50 - great that looks great I like that I
247:52 - like it like that
247:56 - I like it okay beautiful I like it it's
247:59 - a little bit big I feel like no I feel
248:00 - like it's a little bit bigger than what
248:02 - I like it will like to be but it's okay
248:03 - we'll fix that later don't worry about
248:04 - that recommended recommended by for you
248:08 - that's okay so next up let's go ahead
248:12 - um and create our content so as you know
248:15 - why our content is actually going to be
248:17 - here
248:18 - that this is our content right that's
248:19 - our content and that's going to continue
248:21 - the movie so to do that what we'll do is
248:23 - to create a Content component so look at
248:25 - a Content component right
248:27 - and the reason why we're doing this
248:29 - because it's going to make us to it's
248:30 - going to allow us to easily use a grid
248:32 - for example to wrap up our uh you know
248:35 - wrap up our list of stuff right so list
248:37 - of movies all right
248:39 - um okay let's go ahead and create a
248:41 - create a contact
248:43 - content is equal to style.div
248:46 - boom
248:50 - okay save that
248:53 - save that as good
248:54 - all right save that
248:58 - okay
249:01 - and it's all good right there beautiful
249:03 - so content styled dot edif that is
249:07 - pretty pretty awesome okay so let's do
249:09 - the following so now we'll do uh let's
249:11 - create for that content now every single
249:13 - movie just like how it was here is going
249:15 - to be a div as well see how this right
249:17 - here so every single movie here is also
249:20 - going to be a div and we're going to
249:21 - call it a wrap
249:23 - so let's do that here we'll say wrap
249:26 - wrap
249:28 - rap
249:29 - okay I will say here image source is
249:34 - equal to something well our image is
249:36 - going to be the following maybe
249:37 - hopefully maybe hopefully
249:39 - um
249:41 - maybe hopefully uh we can go on and
249:44 - comment this portion out for you guys or
249:46 - but this is going to be a temporary
249:47 - image that I'm going to use it's the is
249:50 - this image right here you see now maybe
249:53 - a month you guys can put it into the
249:55 - chat right here uh or put it into the
249:57 - the YouTube comments as well nothing
250:00 - nothing too much of a crazy solution
250:01 - situation but wraps undefined let's
250:03 - create a wrap right here
250:05 - constant wrap
250:08 - is equal to
250:10 - styled.div Boom
250:13 - all right save it all right this is the
250:15 - image we're going to use the Simpsons
250:17 - image for now now you can get it pretty
250:19 - much any anywhere you want right just go
250:21 - ahead and for example uh you know I'll
250:23 - copy image address I'll knock you I can
250:25 - put it to you guys in the chat I'm a cop
250:26 - yeah I can do it here for example I can
250:28 - put you guys in the chat and maybe for
250:30 - example
250:31 - [Music]
250:34 - let me see
250:36 - uh
250:38 - I've been putting two guys in the chat
250:39 - so you guys can all have it let me see
250:42 - that's the image we're going to use
250:47 - foreign
250:51 - and then maybe a month you can place
250:54 - that into the actual chat on YouTube
250:56 - That'll be amazing actually if you can
250:57 - do that that'll be very very helpful for
250:59 - so many people all right so if we have
251:02 - this let's do the same thing now but
251:03 - let's do multiple like multiple times
251:05 - let's do it like for example how many
251:08 - times do we need well we need it to be
251:09 - one two three four so four times
251:10 - actually so four times so we'll do the
251:12 - same thing we'll do four one two three
251:15 - four save that okay you can see right
251:17 - now it's horrible of course it makes
251:19 - sense right why it's horrible it's from
251:21 - left to right well to fix that again
251:23 - we're going to use grid to fix that
251:25 - right again let's do that so we're going
251:27 - to go on the content side and we're
251:29 - gonna say display
251:30 - display grid
251:33 - a grid okay I will say grid Dash Gap
251:39 - okay it was to be 25 pixels
251:41 - okay
251:43 - pixels and then here we'll say grid
251:46 - template columns so just how we've done
251:48 - different colors before we'll say the
251:50 - same thing here so grid Dash template
251:52 - Dash columns
251:55 - okay and we'll say repeat
251:58 - 4 comma min max
252:04 - right there zero comma one FR right so
252:07 - again same thing but just while
252:09 - repeating it four times
252:10 - boom look at that though so fast we've
252:14 - got our thing finished that's so great
252:16 - okay so that's amazing awesome
252:19 - all right so that's so good so now of
252:21 - course now we have the four cons which
252:23 - is um which is exactly what we want but
252:24 - just so now we need to fix the actual
252:26 - images themselves that's not an issue
252:27 - whatsoever so that means we go to wrap
252:30 - here
252:31 - and now on the image side
252:33 - just how we did it beforehand let's give
252:36 - it a width of a hundred percent
252:38 - little 100 that means it will fill up
252:41 - the full grid see what there see just
252:45 - like that it's fixed height of 100
252:46 - percent
252:49 - 100 percent
252:50 - there okay that stretches the image a
252:53 - little bit so to fix that we do object
252:56 - fit
252:58 - object Dash fit
253:01 - Dash fits could be covered
253:04 - boom see it just object Fitness it will
253:07 - cover up the image within a div okay so
253:10 - we'll it will stretch out as much as
253:12 - possible without while keeping the
253:14 - aspect ratio of the actual image okay
253:16 - beautiful so we got that next thing
253:18 - let's go ahead and focus on the wrap uh
253:21 - let's give it a border radius because I
253:22 - kind of want that so border radius
253:25 - there's also gonna be 10 pixels
253:28 - all right that's that's great that's
253:30 - amazing so I like that SN pixels and
253:33 - then you can see now I know that I know
253:35 - technically if we save this doesn't show
253:36 - 10 pixels don't worry about that we'll
253:38 - make you show a second if I do overflow
253:40 - hidden
253:42 - hidden then it will show it the Border
253:44 - radius
253:45 - bull you see you see what happens again
253:47 - because the image just goes outside the
253:49 - border right and so when we do overflow
253:51 - hidden well then it can continue inside
253:54 - the actual dip beautiful
253:56 - all right next thing let's go ahead and
253:58 - do it gets give the ER a border the
254:01 - board I'm going to use is this one
254:03 - so border three pixels solid rgba with
254:08 - this one right here right so feel free
254:10 - feel free to copy of this one maybe or
254:11 - maybe a month after David maybe you guys
254:13 - can go ahead and copy this one into into
254:14 - somebody some somewhere all right next
254:16 - up a box shadow
254:20 - that's this one boom so again feel free
254:23 - to copy this box shadow in here feel
254:26 - free to copy this to anywhere you want
254:28 - it to be okay
254:30 - hopefully you guys can see that
254:33 - all right so that's box Shadow and
254:36 - honestly that's that's pretty pretty
254:39 - pretty much it that's nothing more
254:41 - crazier than that that's that looks
254:42 - pretty pretty damn good wouldn't you
254:43 - guys say so
254:45 - I would say so
254:47 - I kind of like that actually it's pretty
254:49 - pretty good I like that a lot actually
254:51 - all right so now this point let's do the
254:54 - following here okay I'll do the
254:56 - following here so we have the box Shadow
254:58 - we have the Border we have all of that
255:00 - that's amazing that's awesome let me go
255:02 - ahead and wait wait wait wait wait wait
255:04 - wait wait wait wait wait wait wait what
255:05 - is this no that's good that's good
255:07 - that's good that's good okay next thing
255:10 - Let's do let's do a hover effect so on
255:12 - the hover again we're going to use this
255:14 - uh hover effect right here on the hover
255:16 - of this
255:16 - right boom right let's scale it a little
255:20 - bit a little bit just how we did it
255:21 - before previously
255:22 - transform scale
255:25 - okay save that
255:27 - boom and then let's do let's change the
255:29 - Border color of on this
255:32 - so on the hover of this all we do is we
255:34 - change the Border color to be this so
255:36 - basically it's a similar border color
255:38 - but it's a little more visible see it's
255:39 - a white white color that's what's gonna
255:41 - happen here so it's a white color that's
255:43 - a little more visible that's what's
255:44 - going to happen okay okay
255:48 - then we're going to change the box shell
255:49 - to be a little bit more prevalent as
255:51 - well
255:52 - all right
255:55 - that should be more a little more
255:57 - problems we'll do that
255:59 - to do
256:00 - let's go that's amazing I like that I
256:04 - like that and now see now boom boom boom
256:07 - boom boom boom boom boom boom now right
256:09 - there that's exactly what we want
256:13 - but of course
256:14 - um we don't see you way too much because
256:15 - we need to do Transition so to do a
256:17 - transition we're going to see you use
256:18 - the same transition we used before
256:21 - transition all 250 milliseconds cubic
256:25 - bizire desire it's funny desire so feel
256:28 - free to copy this for yourself right
256:29 - here transition all 250 milliseconds
256:32 - cubic zire 0.25 0.46 0.45 is
256:37 - 0.940 seconds
256:39 - right there
256:41 - okay save that
256:43 - save that oh look at that and let's do a
256:46 - cursor pointer
256:48 - cursor pointer
256:51 - to actually do that it's a cursor
256:53 - pointer
256:54 - oh oh oh oh
256:59 - look at that how cool is that huh dude
257:04 - that's pretty slick guys
257:08 - okay okay that's pretty pretty slick
257:11 - okay I love that that looks so good that
257:14 - looks so good guys all right looks so
257:17 - good look at that the Box shot look at
257:19 - the transition it's so great I love that
257:22 - all right all right so who's still
257:25 - whipping guys you guys still with me yes
257:26 - or no yes yes beautiful I love seeing
257:31 - all your beautiful faces that makes me
257:33 - so so happy all right so we got that
257:36 - portion let's go ahead and look at this
257:37 - if I go ahead and copy this portion this
257:40 - whole thing and I paste it multiple
257:42 - times
257:43 - basically I just create more Simpsons
257:47 - so I create more movies that's that's
257:48 - all I'm doing so that is what our goal
257:51 - was was to create actually just simply
257:52 - just create this all right
257:54 - and uh well the home page I will
257:58 - honestly say is
257:59 - um
258:01 - kaput
258:02 - I mean in terms of design of course the
258:05 - logic not so much there yet but your
258:07 - design it's kapu it's funny it's done
258:08 - right so what I want to focus on so
258:11 - that's awesome so we have that
258:13 - and of course if these images are
258:15 - actually going to be replaced later on
258:16 - by images that come from a database so
258:18 - that's we're gonna we're going to do
258:19 - that later on a little bit but I want to
258:22 - work on a detail page now so let's go
258:23 - and work on a detail page now okay
258:25 - um so detail page
258:28 - so I will save this and let's look at
258:30 - the detail page now the detail page is
258:32 - basically going to be another component
258:33 - so let's go ahead and do here new file
258:36 - here and we'll do
258:38 - detail
258:40 - .js
258:41 - okay JS so that's going to be the detail
258:44 - detail one that we use so let's go ahead
258:46 - and do this so the rfce
258:48 - rfce beautiful create the detail
258:51 - component inside here which is exactly
258:53 - what we need and this will be detail
258:56 - all right sweet all right now how do we
258:59 - go and switch up between detail Peach
259:01 - and the home page good question
259:03 - um well it's going to be very very
259:05 - simple uh we're going to use something
259:07 - called react router Dom so what we need
259:09 - to do is we need to go to app.js
259:11 - and you see how we have the header home
259:12 - so by default it's just simply just
259:15 - throwing the header and the home well we
259:17 - need to change that to be to change to
259:19 - something called react water down so if
259:20 - I'm going to go to if I go to react
259:22 - router Dom here
259:27 - okay
259:28 - right right here you see that's what we
259:30 - need to use so this is what we need to
259:32 - do is react router down so we need to
259:34 - install into install install react water
259:38 - Dom again let's right click it open an
259:41 - integrate terminal
259:42 - right amp you install react part down
259:45 - beautiful
259:50 - nice nice nice nice nice nice nice I
259:52 - like it I like it I like it that's
259:53 - awesome okay all right let me show this
259:59 - hungry
260:03 - it's a lot you know
260:05 - um
260:13 - whoa that's what I'm talking about
260:16 - go left oh go
260:25 - before okay
260:27 - all right
260:28 - so that's good
260:30 - um
260:31 - so
260:33 - we installed we have a react rather down
260:36 - now to actually use it
260:38 - to use it as you can see
260:41 - we need to go ahead and actually import
260:43 - it
260:44 - like so so browse the router and
260:46 - software so let's go ahead and import
260:47 - that
260:48 - so import and you guys can do that on
260:51 - yourself here
260:52 - right there
260:53 - so you need to import
260:56 - right here browser router
260:58 - switch route and Link now
261:01 - the way this works is very simple and
261:03 - I'll show it to you here in a second how
261:04 - this works but
261:06 - red water is pretty much
261:09 - going to wrap your whole application
261:11 - around a route around a router
261:14 - and so we go ahead and we got the router
261:18 - um hold on
261:21 - right here I'm gonna do this
261:24 - router so the whole application is going
261:26 - to be right around the router okay
261:29 - but the fall to every single route will
261:31 - have a header page correct yes correct
261:33 - right so by default
261:35 - everything will have the header page
261:37 - right
261:38 - then
261:39 - what's going to happen is then we'll
261:42 - have multiple routes where either the
261:45 - home page or the detail page changes you
261:47 - can see for example if I click on the
261:48 - detail page here right the header does
261:51 - not change
261:52 - but what does change is this portion
261:55 - right that changes right
261:57 - so that's what we will achieve with this
262:00 - if I go ahead and if I click on this I
262:03 - want to say here now I'm going to say
262:04 - switch
262:05 - switch
262:07 - so again that's coming from directly
262:08 - from here you see that switch
262:10 - switch
262:13 - and switch just means it means okay you
262:15 - turn on this switch this to it this
262:16 - switch or this switch that's all it
262:18 - means
262:19 - and then we will go ahead and do a route
262:22 - so route
262:25 - if we see there's a the path is detail
262:29 - detail
262:32 - if the path is detail we will use the
262:36 - detail page so let's go ahead and do
262:38 - that I'm going to say import detail
262:41 - component
262:43 - from where
262:45 - components right
262:47 - components slash what detail boom voila
262:52 - all right
262:54 - next up
262:55 - so then we do detail
262:58 - like so
263:00 - detail so that will biscuit on the route
263:02 - where the path is slash detail
263:06 - we'll give it a detailed page however if
263:08 - the route is a home page for example
263:11 - like this
263:13 - or the path is actually just just home
263:16 - right there right and then it will have
263:19 - the home one
263:21 - a v-home component
263:24 - I just want to see how this works
263:26 - it's very simple
263:28 - right very simple we have a router
263:30 - that's this
263:32 - right anything that's inside the router
263:34 - will always be visible right so for
263:36 - example the header here will always be
263:38 - visible
263:39 - anything inside the switch case will
263:41 - always change so for example if I have a
263:44 - route here with the path details a path
263:46 - is basically the URL path as this path
263:48 - okay if it's detailed we go to detail
263:51 - page if it's homepage path is slash it's
263:55 - the home page raise your hand that makes
263:56 - sense does that make sense yes or no
263:58 - comprende yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
264:00 - yes yes yes yes beautiful right that's
264:02 - going to be the home page
264:04 - and now let's go ahead and take a look
264:06 - at that
264:07 - all right
264:08 - so if I save this now technically I'm in
264:11 - the home page you see nothing really
264:13 - changed but if I go to slash detail
264:18 - boom we are on a detailed component you
264:23 - see the header still stays which is
264:25 - right here which is exactly we want to
264:27 - do right but the detail component which
264:30 - is this one
264:31 - says detail how sick is that what do you
264:35 - guys think you guys like that
264:37 - I think it's pretty cool
264:39 - all right so that's pretty cool so on
264:41 - the details now let's go ahead and focus
264:42 - on the detail page inside here well
264:45 - the detail page is a little bit longer
264:47 - than some other pages so here's what
264:49 - we'll do let's go ahead and do import
264:52 - styled
264:54 - from style components
264:57 - style Dash components
265:00 - okay
265:02 - so import style from style Dash
265:04 - components okay and a few things are
265:07 - going to happen here in the detail page
265:08 - of course let's go and make this a
265:10 - container as we like to do all the time
265:16 - so we'll say container
265:20 - container just like so
265:25 - all right beautiful not defined that's
265:27 - not a problem whatsoever so we say now
265:29 - const the phone will do the following so
265:32 - const container
265:34 - is equal to what
265:36 - oh is equal to style dot div
265:41 - right there
265:43 - okay start the div okay and this
265:46 - dialogue is going to be pretty pretty
265:48 - simple uh same thing we're gonna give it
265:51 - a Min height just how it did it for home
265:53 - so Min height
265:54 - I mean height
265:57 - [Music]
265:58 - I mean height I mean height is going to
266:01 - be calc a hundred vertical hey vertical
266:04 - height 100 VH minus 70 pixel step 70
266:07 - pixels basically that's the that's that
266:09 - top bar right there
266:11 - okay
266:12 - awesome and then we'll get also pattern
266:15 - just how we did we give a pattern to the
266:17 - homepage too so padding which is this
266:19 - one so zero calc 3.5 for ver no VW
266:24 - basically means
266:27 - um width so basically that's the
266:29 - viewport width so 3.5 viewport width
266:32 - right there ah right there beautiful see
266:35 - all right so that's all good now of
266:38 - course if you think about this what does
266:41 - this have let's think about what does
266:43 - this specific thing have well it has a
266:45 - few things
266:46 - in terms of components well we have this
266:49 - this is the main component correct but
266:51 - this component is actually has a
266:52 - background you see it has a background
266:53 - image right so we can call the
266:55 - background image and then we have this
266:57 - kind of like logo and then we have I
267:00 - like to think of it as like a roll so
267:02 - right see you see I always think of I
267:04 - see things as rows and columns this to
267:06 - me is a row that contains multiple
267:08 - columns column of one button another
267:11 - button third button and fourth button
267:14 - right then we have another row that has
267:17 - this then another row that has
267:20 - the description basically of the thing
267:22 - do you understand that yes or no right
267:25 - yes all good yes yes yes yes yes good
267:28 - awesome sweet so that's what that has
267:30 - okay
267:31 - all right now and we can simply just
267:33 - honestly based on look at what we just
267:35 - have you can see we can do it so the
267:36 - first we need to create is the
267:38 - background is the background component
267:40 - so let's create the background component
267:41 - so we'll say background
267:44 - background
267:47 - boom background component and we'll give
267:50 - it an image
267:51 - source is equal to the following right
267:54 - and maybe if a monthly maybe because can
267:56 - help me out and actually give them this
267:58 - image source
268:00 - and this image stores again you can use
268:02 - any image source you want but in my in
268:05 - my case I have this one which maybe I
268:07 - can give it to you guys in chat
268:09 - here I'll go take us in chat
268:13 - boom that's the image I use okay that's
268:16 - the image I used
268:17 - let's just basically just this image
268:19 - right here all right
268:22 - okay that's the image and then so that's
268:25 - going to be the component if I go ahead
268:26 - and save that okay we have an error says
268:28 - background is not defined so it's a
268:30 - const const background
268:35 - is equal to styled dot div
268:40 - style.div
268:41 - the first other dip beautiful
268:45 - okay oh let's go look at that I mean it
268:49 - looks horrible but it's still it's kind
268:50 - of there right
268:52 - now adjust how I did our background
268:55 - image we're going to position it also
268:57 - fixed to the whole page so as we'll do
268:59 - we'll do the position fixed
269:02 - position fixed you see
269:05 - boom change right here we'll say top
269:09 - zero
269:11 - top zero
269:13 - right we'll say left zero just how I
269:15 - would like to do it left zero bottom
269:18 - zero
269:19 - right and then what a right zero
269:23 - right zero
269:24 - okay
269:26 - okay boom right there right zero okay
269:28 - now again it looks a little bit odd here
269:30 - I can see that right right there don't
269:31 - worry about that we'll make it work
269:32 - don't worry and then here's what we'll
269:34 - do in that case right so and then
269:35 - position fix about position fix to what
269:37 - well position fix to the actual
269:39 - container so we'll say here position
269:41 - relative remember if you're doing
269:43 - position absolute position fixed you
269:46 - have to use position relative because it
269:48 - will fix it to the relative parent kind
269:51 - of like you have to have a parent kind
269:52 - of like that you know you will have a
269:54 - parent right so position
269:57 - relative
269:59 - save that right nothing really changes
270:02 - here in the in those terms but what does
270:04 - change is the following look at this I'm
270:06 - going to now Target the image itself
270:08 - image
270:10 - right and I'm going to say here the
270:13 - image here is with a hundred percent
270:18 - with a hundred percent
270:19 - good and height of what of 100 as well
270:25 - okay I know it got stretched out but
270:27 - don't worry because what we can do is we
270:28 - can say object fit
270:31 - object Dash fit
270:34 - is gonna be what cover
270:37 - I want you guys to look into that cover
270:39 - boom see
270:41 - oh Moly Moly now you can see it just
270:43 - covered the whole thing right which is
270:45 - don't worry about that don't you know
270:47 - um so to prevent that from covering the
270:50 - whole thing it's very it's as simple as
270:52 - well I'll just put a z index minus one
270:54 - on it so that's it look okay Z index
270:57 - minus one and now the header shows as
271:01 - well
271:02 - and yeah that's it's as simple as that
271:04 - nothing too crazy you have to you have
271:06 - to honestly do let's add some more let's
271:09 - add a small opacity to something opacity
271:12 - fast is 0.8
271:15 - oh so it's a little bit darker you see
271:17 - that a little bit darker and honestly
271:19 - that is that background image that is
271:21 - done comprende yes all good beautiful
271:24 - awesome sweet
271:26 - all right so I like that let's now go
271:28 - back to our what go back to our top and
271:32 - let's think about what else do we have
271:33 - well we also have this thing which is
271:35 - this which I like to call a title so so
271:38 - basically that's done now let's call
271:40 - let's you let's focus on this one
271:43 - right focusing down so that's going to
271:45 - be the title okay
271:47 - and we'll call it image title
271:54 - which title
271:55 - boom and we'll also give an image image
271:59 - source
272:00 - and I also have that source for now
272:02 - again this data will come later on from
272:04 - a database so don't worry about that
272:06 - okay then we're going to copy this image
272:08 - so you guys can all have it and I'll
272:10 - paste in the chat as well maybe a month
272:12 - a month after div you can paste it in
272:13 - the comments on YouTube as well that'd
272:15 - be awesome thank you
272:18 - okay I'm gonna paste it here
272:22 - boom okay all right so that's gonna be
272:25 - that all right let's go to our
272:27 - application here so it's the images are
272:28 - not defined of course we Define it in
272:30 - using style.div
272:32 - nothing crazy here let's do the
272:34 - following and we say what image title
272:37 - and
272:38 - no Define it first
272:45 - image title
272:48 - is equal to styled dot div
272:52 - done
272:53 - oh let's go that looks like I mean not
272:57 - that much but it's not bad again we can
273:00 - also use some really really cool things
273:02 - with that right so image Title Here
273:05 - we're going to give it a height
273:08 - of 30 VH
273:10 - protocol height
273:12 - okay right and don't worry about it
273:15 - we'll focusate on the image and then
273:17 - we'll we'll give the image so here's
273:19 - here's the thing with images give it a
273:21 - parent container
273:23 - and then on the image say with 100 and
273:26 - do object fit that is your recipe for
273:30 - any good image sizing
273:32 - give a parent container right a
273:34 - container to contain once you've done
273:37 - that on the image say with 100 100 and
273:41 - then give it an object fit that is your
273:44 - your go-to that should be your go-to
273:45 - okay
273:46 - so do image same thing with a hundred
273:50 - percent
273:52 - okay a height of a hundred percent
273:55 - yeah
273:57 - look at this object fixed this time the
273:59 - however contained
274:02 - right
274:04 - boom
274:06 - big difference huh much big difference
274:08 - much big difference right don't worry
274:10 - we'll make it a better even right now so
274:13 - as we'll do I'll do uh width of this one
274:16 - is going to be 35
274:18 - BW
274:21 - viewport with right there see that makes
274:23 - it even better and then we give it a
274:25 - minute let's go ahead and give it a Min
274:26 - height
274:27 - just in case
274:30 - main height
274:33 - main height of 170 pixels
274:38 - beautiful and then we'll do a main width
274:41 - of 200 pixels
274:46 - men with
274:48 - of 200 pixels
274:51 - all right so nothing created just has
274:54 - changed but all we know is that this is
274:55 - working this image is great right so
274:57 - let's uh we're getting very close to
274:59 - where we want to get to all right next
275:01 - up what we need to do is next up is we
275:04 - need to go ahead and focus on what
275:05 - that's going to be kind of like this
275:07 - content right here
275:09 - all this content right here I want to
275:10 - focus now on the controls
275:13 - you see this on the controls so let's go
275:15 - ahead and focus on the controls here so
275:18 - I want to say the following I'm going to
275:20 - say here
275:23 - controls let's go ahead and do ah
275:25 - controls right here I'm going to create
275:27 - the controls con so controls oh controls
275:31 - controls container
275:33 - boom controls and all that will simply
275:36 - do is very simple let's go ahead and
275:38 - that will contain the play button and
275:40 - stuff like that right so let's go ahead
275:41 - and install that div
275:44 - foreign
275:45 - controls
275:48 - const controls
275:51 - is equal to styled dot div
275:56 - okay and inside here it's very simple we
275:59 - have four buttons here one two three
276:01 - four okay one two three
276:04 - on that side it's very simple now at
276:07 - this point we need to create four
276:09 - buttons One's Gonna Be the play button
276:11 - so when you hear the play button
276:15 - okay got crushed on it then we do the
276:18 - trailer button
276:21 - trailer button
276:23 - okay and then we have the add button
276:26 - so let's go ahead and add that one too
276:29 - add button
276:32 - beautiful and then we have the group
276:34 - watch button
276:37 - oh watch
276:39 - button
276:43 - go watch button there we go awesome
276:45 - sweet
276:47 - so that's kind of that so group watch
276:49 - button is what we're focusing on right
276:50 - now at this point okay let's go ahead
276:52 - and create all these buttons right right
276:53 - so let's go ahead and do the bottom
276:55 - let's go to the bottom we don't need any
276:56 - of this just yet okay let's go to the
276:59 - bottom and we'll just go ahead and focus
277:01 - on the buttons himself so let's do the
277:03 - following so here we'll say const play
277:06 - button right is equal to styled
277:09 - dot div right that's that okay next
277:13 - one's gonna be which one next is going
277:15 - to be the trailer button so it's a const
277:17 - triller button
277:18 - foreign
277:24 - same thing here
277:26 - NASA is going to be const which one the
277:29 - add button
277:31 - right here and that's going to go to
277:33 - styled.div as well
277:35 - dot div boom nice last one is going to
277:39 - be the group watch button
277:42 - oop oops oopsie Daisy
277:48 - group watch
277:50 - button is equal to also style that div
277:54 - [Music]
277:56 - all right let's see what these now have
278:00 - inside okay so let's try this let's go
278:03 - and take a look at this nothing they
278:05 - have absolutely nothing but also we made
278:07 - it with small mistakes because this
278:08 - needs actually be a button so we need to
278:09 - go
278:12 - call this button
278:13 - not this but but you see button
278:16 - button button button okay so that's it
278:20 - we've got ourselves a bug that have
278:22 - nothing inside them right now but we'll
278:23 - fix that here in a little bit okay so
278:26 - let's go and take a look at the actual
278:27 - buttons on what we need to have inside
278:30 - them well the button will Purge part one
278:33 - the bodies will have uh kind of like
278:35 - things inside of it right so every
278:36 - single button
278:38 - well let's look at the play button first
278:40 - for example here
278:42 - so play button has what the play icon
278:43 - and the text play so we'll give it an
278:45 - image here so we'll do image
278:48 - image
278:49 - source is equal to
278:53 - equal to what is equal to Dash images
278:56 - okay Dash the play icon black button
279:01 - that we have actually inside our images
279:03 - which we downloaded by the way
279:05 - right here
279:06 - boom
279:08 - okay so that's the one we need to use
279:09 - okay that's gonna be our images inside
279:12 - the play button and then we need to go
279:14 - ahead and create a span
279:17 - and that's going to say play
279:20 - right there play as component
279:23 - capitalized so it's easier for us
279:25 - yeah let's look at this oh let's go it
279:28 - looks so bad but it's there
279:30 - right let's do the same thing with the
279:32 - trailer Button as well so we can focus
279:34 - on two at the same time okay
279:36 - so do the trailer button at the same
279:38 - time same thing with this one that's
279:40 - going to copy this image put it in the
279:42 - trailer button right but this time the
279:45 - trailer button is going to be play icon
279:48 - White
279:49 - not black but white
279:52 - this one
279:53 - hopefully you guys are still with me all
279:55 - right and then we have what then we have
279:57 - the span
279:59 - right now spinning so old it's just a
280:01 - wrapper and that will be what the
280:03 - Thriller button
280:05 - that's it okay all right so now we have
280:08 - two buttons you can see here one is
280:10 - trillion one is played they have
280:11 - different styling for them so that's
280:13 - what we need to what we need to focus on
280:14 - now at this point let's go let's go now
280:16 - to our play button and a few things that
280:20 - we need to focus on on the play button
280:22 - well
280:22 - a few things let's think about part one
280:25 - let's think about the Border radius
280:26 - right so we need to go ahead because it
280:27 - kind of looks horrible right now so do
280:29 - border radius
280:32 - radius right and let's give it four
280:35 - pixels body radius
280:37 - so it's a little bit cleaner and
280:39 - software so what it is four pixels and
280:42 - so forth okay next up let's change the
280:44 - font size of this so we'll do font size
280:45 - just a bit of a more of a font size
280:49 - okay all right so it's a little bit
280:51 - bigger now at the same time now you can
280:52 - see how these play buttons oh look let
280:54 - me go ahead and remove this portion
280:55 - right here we don't need that you see
280:57 - this butt play button so you see how
280:58 - they're not kind of like aligned aligned
281:00 - uh horizontal vertically correct so we
281:02 - can do this use display flag so it's in
281:04 - display Flex
281:06 - foreign
281:08 - tically align them
281:10 - okay oh don't worry about that don't
281:12 - worry about that that's fine
281:14 - and I will say here align items
281:18 - a line
281:20 - line a line
281:22 - with their items Center
281:25 - boom boom you see now the play button is
281:27 - aligned now let's go ahead and make sure
281:30 - that all of these but are aligned
281:32 - horizontally as well to do that we do go
281:34 - to controls and I say here display Flex
281:38 - display Flex
281:41 - flex and what do we say you see that
281:43 - puts them in a in a row by row fashion
281:46 - because by default the flex direction is
281:49 - rho not column you see and so we go that
281:52 - puts them into like the it's one row
281:53 - basically right into one row
281:56 - all right so that's good Flex direction
281:58 - is basically in the one row now let's go
282:00 - ahead and do the following for the play
282:01 - button let's give it a height
282:05 - let's go to height
282:07 - or 56 pixels
282:10 - all right so it's a little bit a little
282:13 - bit bigger okay and let's uh do the
282:16 - following let's go ahead and give a um
282:19 - let's think about this here for a second
282:21 - I will go ahead and actually say
282:24 - background color it's good just change
282:25 - the background color for this one so say
282:27 - background color
282:28 - I'll just do this boom
282:31 - so background color should be that now
282:34 - of course it's not that just yet let's
282:36 - go ahead and remove the Border
282:40 - border
282:41 - border can you see how we had the Border
282:43 - that's a hideous right now hey there we
282:46 - go so much better look at that so much
282:48 - better all right let's also add a little
282:51 - bit species on the left hand side and
282:52 - the right hand side and to do that all
282:53 - we do is we simply just do uh padding
282:56 - right so we do padding
282:59 - so padding
283:01 - zero pixels on the top or bottom and the
283:04 - butt on the left and right will do 24
283:06 - pixels
283:08 - simple as that right there see and now
283:11 - let's go ahead and add
283:13 - um uh let's add some margins so let's do
283:16 - margin right you see to make sure that
283:17 - it pushes this trailer one so we'll do a
283:19 - margin right here
283:21 - margin Dash right like this and we'll
283:24 - give it a 24 22 pixel margin oh
283:29 - boom done look at that it's already
283:31 - getting much much better than what we'll
283:33 - want to do let's also in terms of color
283:36 - the black color that's all good I like
283:38 - that uh let me think about what else do
283:40 - well so we think should we do let's add
283:42 - some lighter spacing let's change that
283:43 - up a little bit here as well so letter
283:46 - spacing just to space it out a little
283:47 - bit more
283:49 - spacing and we'll do 1.8 pixels
283:55 - right just spaces out just a bit more
283:57 - just more so it's yeah I like that a lot
283:59 - better actually yeah I like a lot better
284:01 - and that's good okay that's awesome and
284:04 - let's of course let's make it a cursor
284:05 - pointer too right so that means when I
284:07 - can click on it when I can hover over it
284:09 - because right now
284:10 - it's not a cursor pointer right so let's
284:12 - do cursor pointer
284:15 - cursor
284:16 - let's do a pointer boom
284:19 - all right oh something happened oh right
284:22 - here
284:23 - right there so now if I hold it see it's
284:25 - a cursor pointed now okay good so now
284:27 - we're not there yet okay not there yet I
284:29 - like that now let's go look at the back
284:31 - let's glue now let's think about the
284:32 - hover uh solution so on the hover of
284:35 - this we're going to use this again so on
284:36 - the hover of this on this whole button
284:38 - we're going to change the background
284:40 - color just a little bit right so here
284:44 - background
284:46 - see this
284:49 - boom so now oh boom boom boom you see it
284:52 - right there boom boom okay good so I
284:55 - like that that's amazing that's awesome
284:58 - now the same thing is gonna happen with
285:01 - the trailer button right with the
285:03 - trailer button now
285:05 - check this portion out the trailer
285:07 - button right has the same style as this
285:11 - except it changes a few things like for
285:14 - example the background color
285:15 - well check out what we can do we can
285:17 - actually import it we can actually use
285:19 - like for example it's kind of like
285:20 - polymorphism you know in classes but in
285:23 - our case we can actually kind of like
285:24 - import the style so I'll do styled
285:27 - play button look at this style play
285:29 - button
285:34 - see now it's the same great great great
285:36 - great way but all I gotta do if you need
285:39 - to know in order to change color all I
285:40 - do is the following I say background is
285:43 - going to be the following so it's the
285:44 - back is going to be a little bit more
285:45 - darker here
285:46 - foreign and we're almost done guys guys
285:49 - we're almost done for today by the way
285:51 - just want to let you guys know that
285:52 - almost done okay I like that let's do a
285:55 - little bit give it a little bit more of
285:56 - a border so I I like that too
286:00 - more of a border one pixel solid so kind
286:02 - of like a white border as well and let's
286:05 - go ahead and let's do the following
286:07 - let's do a color so let's go ahead and
286:09 - do more of a white color I guess like a
286:11 - more of a lighter white color
286:16 - boom look at that oh let's go now of
286:20 - course also I kind of want to if I go to
286:22 - here Ah that's fine that's great oh
286:25 - let's go guys how cool does that look
286:27 - now all right uh let's make sure this
286:30 - text text transform actually let's do
286:32 - text transform uppercase
286:35 - so make sure it's text transformed to
286:37 - make sure it's all applications text
286:39 - transform this form let's do uppercase
286:43 - to make sure it's all uppercase
286:46 - okay save that
286:48 - boom done
286:50 - holy man look at this guys that's so
286:53 - good okay so I like that so play Trilla
286:55 - that's all there I love that portion
286:57 - okay let me go let me go I'll call this
286:59 - close this out we have a few more ones
287:01 - which is going to be the add button so
287:03 - far let's go ahead and focus on the add
287:04 - button which looks a little bit more
287:05 - different right
287:07 - it has like it only has it's just one
287:09 - icon right so in the add button all
287:11 - we're going to do is just simply just an
287:13 - image so that's all we'll do so in the
287:15 - ad and the uh
287:17 - in uh the add button and all that will
287:21 - be is simply just like a background a
287:24 - background image let me let me think
287:25 - about this for a second here
287:35 - so in the app add list button uh it
287:39 - would just be like a plus that we need
287:40 - to go ahead and add and that's pretty
287:42 - much it so if you look at it here look
287:45 - at this inspect
287:49 - you see here
287:51 - we have this span
287:52 - span so it actually creates like a
287:54 - really interesting solution but I don't
287:57 - want to do it that way actually I
287:58 - actually want to do a little bit
287:59 - differently you see I'm going to just
288:01 - simply do a plus icon or just just
288:03 - simply just a plus that we're going to
288:05 - use inside our thing so look at this
288:07 - I'll see I will say here as I will say
288:09 - span
288:11 - I will say here span oops
288:14 - span
288:16 - plus right I know nothing crazy so far
288:20 - right but don't worry it's gonna happen
288:22 - right so to make this this one happen
288:25 - what's gonna happen is we're gonna give
288:26 - it a height and a width as well so let's
288:28 - go to the add button
288:32 - okay
288:33 - let's go ahead and give it a width
288:36 - all 44 pixels
288:38 - let's give it a height
288:41 - of 44 pixels
288:43 - okay good so that's that's awesome
288:45 - sweets that makes me that makes me happy
288:47 - next up uh let's go ahead and just how
288:50 - did it in the other one let's go ahead
288:52 - and do uh display Flex
288:56 - play Flex
288:59 - right okay and now let's focus on the
289:01 - span
289:02 - as you span here
289:05 - let's do spin and let's change the font
289:08 - size of this one to be more so font size
289:12 - this would be maybe 16 pixels 18 pixels
289:16 - let's see maybe maybe more what do you
289:19 - guys think 24 pixels 26 pixels
289:23 - yeah it's about that ah I would say 30.
289:26 - there we go much better right all right
289:29 - so display Flex we're gonna do now align
289:30 - item Center to align everything inside
289:33 - there horizontally or vertically align
289:35 - Center
289:38 - okay and then we'll do Justified Contest
289:40 - Center to do align it horizontal all
289:42 - right so justify content Center
289:44 - foreign
289:45 - justify
289:48 - content
289:50 - Justified that content is going to be
289:53 - Center
289:55 - done so that that's a very nicely
289:57 - centered uh so forth let's do border
289:59 - release to give it a nice circular
290:00 - border for this radius
290:03 - 50 of course
290:06 - nice look at that it's time to look a
290:08 - button right I like that all right so
290:11 - that's really cool that's really cool
290:12 - motor radius all right and let's go
290:14 - ahead and do a background let's do that
290:17 - let's do background let's give it a
290:19 - border actually border of white
290:22 - so border here is gonna be white
290:25 - okay so it's a white border that's
290:26 - awesome let's give it a different
290:28 - background color too a background color
290:30 - should be this as well
290:34 - done look at that right let's also do a
290:37 - color white
290:39 - color white on the actual span
290:44 - oh let's go look at that and then we'll
290:47 - do a cursor pointer on the actual full
290:49 - button so we'll do cursor
290:53 - cursor pointer
290:56 - boom right there and honestly that's
290:59 - that's pretty pretty much it we'll do
291:01 - here again there we go and then we'll do
291:04 - a margin right of 16 pixels to push the
291:06 - other button away so margin
291:10 - margin Dash right will be 16 pixels
291:15 - good so let's go ahead and save that
291:17 - all right save that all right it's going
291:20 - to refresh that beautiful oh it looks so
291:22 - good so good now you can see here that
291:24 - this button is not vertically aligned
291:27 - with all these other ones you see how
291:28 - it's kind of more the top versus more
291:30 - centered so how would we go ahead and do
291:32 - that to make sure it's fully centered
291:34 - well that's a very very simple solution
291:36 - honestly again display Flex
291:40 - so to do that we go to our parent which
291:42 - is the controls the controls controls
291:45 - the controls controls everything right
291:48 - so we go to controls errors and controls
291:50 - display flags and we do align items look
291:53 - at this
291:55 - Center and watch it boom you see this
291:59 - just became centered
292:00 - just like that it's so simple
292:02 - right so that's right there is going to
292:04 - be our plus plus button all right last
292:07 - button that we're going to focus on is
292:10 - going to be
292:12 - that's our button right there let me see
292:15 - right there last one is going to be the
292:17 - group watch button okay and I think it
292:19 - probably is the Sim similar button that
292:21 - we should use a music coupon button but
292:23 - this one's gonna have an image so let's
292:25 - try that right out
292:26 - so this one has an image right here so
292:29 - group watch button okay let's add an
292:31 - image here
292:33 - okay and we'll get a source is equal to
292:36 - okay is equal to what well we have a
292:39 - group icon that we can use
292:40 - right there
292:42 - so this is in your images folder if you
292:44 - downloaded it from the drive
292:47 - right there
292:50 - okay that's your image okay so that's
292:52 - good group watch button I like that
292:55 - that's awesome and again we'll do the
292:57 - same thing I think I think it's worth
292:59 - doing like the same thing which is also
293:01 - with 44 pixels and everything
293:02 - everything's pretty much uh you know
293:03 - similar so let's try that so we'll do I
293:07 - think we can probably let me see
293:10 - I can probably use styled
293:12 - actually this
293:14 - add button look at this guys
293:17 - I
293:18 - button oops no this other one
293:23 - okay so that's good all we need to do is
293:25 - just differentiate the color a little
293:27 - bit a little bit because you can see
293:28 - here
293:29 - it's a little more darker color here so
293:31 - we'll differentiate the color here just
293:33 - a little bit but giving it a darker a
293:37 - darker background color which is
293:39 - actually more of a more of a it's
293:41 - actually more of a background color
293:42 - black
293:44 - boom
293:46 - boom done done
293:49 - done
293:51 - that's it done look at that oh oh oh how
293:55 - good is that what do you guys think are
293:57 - you guys still with it yes or no
293:59 - we've got ourselves you see well very
294:01 - slowly we're turning out to have an
294:03 - amazing solution here an amazing product
294:06 - like you know little by little we have
294:08 - CSS going so far look at this guys
294:11 - all right look at all these CSS we just
294:13 - did all using style components that's
294:16 - pretty pretty epic I will say so all
294:18 - right and we're not too far off from
294:20 - actually being fully done right now we
294:21 - have a subtitle that I'm gonna do
294:23 - description
294:24 - and that's pretty pretty much it so
294:27 - let's go ahead and do that let's go
294:27 - finish this up let's finish it up with a
294:30 - button you guys
294:34 - oh oh

294:48 - talking about all right last thing that
294:50 - we go ahead I need to do is well it's
294:53 - the following okay so let's go ahead and
294:55 - take a look at it
294:56 - all right
294:59 - by the way how is Facebook doing how's

295:21 - need to hide anything I've got
295:22 - everything here I need
295:24 - fully all right all right let's go ahead
295:27 - and do one last thing here that we need
295:29 - to go ahead and do all right by the way
295:31 - guys on YouTube can we please get to
295:34 - a thousand likes is that possible can we
295:37 - get to a thousand likes on YouTube
295:38 - That'll be amazing those of you on Zoom

295:45 - you're still with me yes yes yes
295:46 - beautiful that's what I'm talking about
295:48 - all right
295:49 - next thing oh we need to kind of focus
295:52 - on is going to be now this detail page
295:55 - which is a list page right here I can
295:58 - actually just copy this for now
295:59 - temporarily I'm going to copy this and
296:01 - I'm going to call a subtitle here so
296:02 - let's go ahead and create a subtitle
296:04 - component so let's go ahead and do this
296:05 - so we'll do subtitle here actually not
296:08 - not inside the controls but actually
296:09 - it's outside of control so we'll do
296:10 - subtitle
296:12 - sub
296:14 - sub
296:16 - title
296:18 - okay
296:19 - I subtitle and that's going to contain
296:22 - the actual text which is this is
296:23 - temporary text okay placeholder text
296:25 - that's what that's all we know okay and
296:27 - then inside there we're going to create
296:29 - the description
296:33 - and I'll give you guys you know the
296:35 - actual text if you need text but you can
296:36 - put anything you want in there right you
296:38 - you don't even need just put anything
296:39 - you want let's just that's temporary
296:41 - until we actually get it from the
296:42 - database so for now just put anything
296:44 - you want in there okay
296:46 - so that's Shin okay all right let's
296:50 - go and copy this
296:53 - right boom done nothing too fancy like I
296:57 - said right nothing too fancy at all all
296:59 - right of course when if we go back to
297:01 - our application says something that's
297:02 - not defined that's the normal usual
297:04 - thing so what we need to do we need to
297:06 - Define it so we'll say the following so
297:07 - do style.div so const
297:11 - subtitle
297:14 - go ahead make sure you guys can see the
297:15 - top here
297:17 - subtitle
297:18 - is equal to styled dot div
297:22 - beautiful
297:24 - style that dip awesome sweet nice so
297:28 - let's start the dev and that's amazing
297:30 - let's do something with the same thing
297:31 - with description const
297:34 - ipation
297:36 - is equal to styled dot div as well
297:41 - all right all right Maddie's oh
297:45 - what just happened
297:46 - what happened description
297:49 - the heck
297:50 - I did not okay good wait holy moly I
297:54 - will not just kill the whole application
297:55 - with this that'd be funny if I did
297:57 - though all right so for the subtitle it
298:00 - shouldn't be anything too crazy let's go
298:02 - ahead and um change the color just be a
298:04 - little bit more of a lighter color
298:07 - so I'm gonna do command click on this
298:09 - command click and this takes me the
298:11 - actual style so that's one thing you
298:12 - actually can use color which is this
298:14 - color
298:15 - okay save that it's a just very light
298:18 - color Okay font size 15 pixels
298:21 - find this if so let's go ahead make this
298:24 - a little bit there you go a smaller font
298:26 - size let's do Min height uh main height
298:29 - of 20 pixels as well
298:32 - [Music]
298:33 - okay let's also give a margin top margin
298:36 - top let's do margin top
298:39 - margin top 26 pixels to give it a a uh
298:42 - what's it called
298:45 - there we go just to push a little more
298:47 - to the bottom here you see just to push
298:49 - it more to the bottom right here
298:50 - I like that okay snap pushes more to the
298:52 - bottom and then same thing with
298:54 - description let's go ahead and do that
298:56 - so now if we're in description
298:59 - let's look at the description here okay
299:01 - awesome
299:03 - that's pretty simple similar one as well
299:05 - right uh let's do we'll change the line
299:07 - height here for a little bit so we'll do
299:08 - line height
299:12 - line height
299:14 - or say 1.4
299:17 - so so it creates more of a spacing you
299:19 - see I kind of like that a lot more let's
299:21 - do fonts let's give it more of a font
299:22 - size a bigger font size so font size
299:25 - 20 pixels so it's a bigger text boom
299:29 - beautiful let's do padding top is going
299:32 - to be so we'll do margin top is actually
299:35 - going to be much top 16 pixels
299:39 - boom nice I like that awesome sweet
299:42 - let's do the same thing with the color
299:44 - right there
299:47 - same with the color
299:49 - ah yes and well I mean that's that's
299:53 - pretty much it look at that holy moly
299:55 - let's go that's pretty much it guys how
299:57 - cool is that what do you guys think we
300:00 - have ourselves a detail page now yes it
300:02 - does not connect directly to the thing
300:04 - that's gonna have the connection is
300:06 - gonna happen tomorrow the whole Redux
300:07 - all of that that's gonna happen tomorrow
300:10 - although Redux connecting right you know
300:13 - the reactor down with three Ducks
300:15 - actually pull and then data from a
300:17 - Firebase that's going to happen tomorrow
300:18 - who's excited for that let me know in
300:20 - the comments below who decide for that
300:22 - one that's gonna be pretty cool that's
300:24 - pretty cool it's not easy but we'll do
300:26 - it all right
300:27 - and the last thing that I kind of maybe
300:29 - want to touch on is potentially the
300:31 - login page so let's go and touch on the
300:33 - login page I think they'll be a lot of
300:34 - fun as well okay login page should not
300:36 - be anything too crazy so we'll just
300:38 - touch on the login page a little bit as
300:40 - well so what we have here well we have
300:42 - the detail page which is here
300:44 - boom okay we have ourselves at the
300:48 - detail page oh that's the home page then
300:49 - we have the detail page
300:52 - okay and then let's go ahead and create
300:54 - a login page uh well a login page as
300:57 - well with this all right let me see so
300:59 - to do this let's go and create a login
301:01 - component so let's go ahead first is
301:03 - first let's go ahead and do add detail
301:06 - page and uh detail page in our
301:10 - commit as always
301:12 - okay and let's do this let's do
301:14 - components let's do a login page so
301:16 - right click new file we'll do login
301:20 - .js
301:23 - boom
301:24 - login.js let's do rfce boom that creates
301:28 - the login page and so forth right okay
301:31 - so that's going to be the login page
301:33 - okay and then what we'll do is very
301:36 - simple we'll to make this happen let's
301:38 - go to our home to our app.js and if
301:41 - there's a route that says the login
301:43 - route we'll just take it there so say
301:45 - route
301:47 - path is equal to what let's just say
301:50 - login
301:53 - slash login
301:55 - and what do we do
301:57 - what do we do well we import the login
302:00 - component so we say import
302:02 - login from where
302:06 - from
302:08 - dot dash components
302:11 - Dash what login
302:13 - dunzo
302:14 - okay so marginal file you tend to import
302:17 - components let me see components of log
302:20 - and I create one
302:22 - oh it should be there
302:25 - let me see
302:27 - outside the project folder
302:29 - all because of this right here done
302:32 - done ah awesome sweet let's go and do
302:34 - that awesome so that's good and so now
302:37 - we go to this you should we should use
302:38 - the logging components let's try to try
302:40 - that
302:42 - login component oh
302:46 - done all right let's go and go now let's
302:49 - go to our logging component oh let's go
302:53 - login
302:55 - boom login is what we got and if we go
302:58 - to login in the in our actual build
303:00 - function
303:01 - sign out here's our login component you
303:03 - can see not you know nothing nothing
303:06 - crazy so far okay nothing crazy so far
303:08 - and this is where we will be very smart
303:11 - okay you can see how the header is still
303:13 - the same but it changes when the login
303:15 - point is different so we'll do that
303:17 - tomorrow that's part of Redux we'll have
303:18 - we'll make that tomorrow but today is
303:20 - we'll focus on this portion right here
303:22 - right we'll focus on this push we'll
303:24 - create this button which is beautiful
303:25 - we'll create this image right here and
303:27 - then this stuff right here as well so a
303:29 - few different things I welcome to create
303:30 - right now so let's go look into well
303:33 - what components do we have for this well
303:37 - few things we have the actual container
303:40 - that's the width 100 right okay then
303:44 - what I like to let me go ahead and put a
303:45 - rectangle here so we have this okay and
303:49 - then we have I like to call the content
303:51 - section why because it gets centered
303:53 - horizontally and vertically you see if I
303:55 - go ahead and look at the brush see it
303:57 - gets sent horizontally centered
304:00 - and also vertically
304:02 - right that's that right and then of
304:05 - course inside that we have a few
304:06 - different things we have well what do we
304:08 - have we have a few logos so we have a
304:12 - kind of like uh let me see I'm going to
304:13 - rectangle here the logo here that's
304:15 - going to become that's going to be
304:16 - component that we're going to use as
304:17 - well
304:19 - then
304:20 - let me see let me see then we have a
304:22 - button called get all there
304:25 - button okay and then finally we have a
304:29 - description get Premiere access
304:31 - and then finally we have another logo
304:32 - code like this
304:34 - that's it
304:36 - that's pretty much it so uh with that
304:39 - being said let's just look into what we
304:40 - do so let's go to login page
304:43 - it's got a login page I mean a lot of
304:45 -  is hideous right now but but Logan
304:47 - page let's start up with the container
304:48 - okay so oh let's go and import style so
304:51 - import styled
304:53 - guys we're almost done we're going to
304:55 - create the login page and then we're
304:56 - almost done for today and then we'll
304:58 - finish up tomorrow okay so import styled
305:01 - from
305:04 - style Dash component
305:09 - okay
305:12 - all right from stylish components okay
305:15 - that's awesome and this one let's go
305:18 - ahead and create a container here
305:22 - okay let's do const
305:26 - container is equal to styled
305:30 - dot div
305:33 - beautiful style.df that's amazing okay
305:37 - so now okay a few things are gonna
305:39 - happen here at this point let's do the
305:40 - same thing remember in the con in
305:42 - specific container we need to one is we
305:45 - need to kind of change up this image
305:47 - which is a pretty cool image that's
305:49 - pretty pretty sweet and we need to add
305:51 - that background image in a little bit
305:52 - here so let's go ahead and add a uh well
305:55 - we can do a few things here the same
305:56 - thing we did before remember how we did
305:58 - that before let's do it right now so
306:00 - inside here
306:02 - look at this let's do a before just
306:05 - we'll do before so we'll do position
306:07 - relative here position
306:10 - relative
306:14 - okay and we'll do the whole before thing
306:16 - which is what did the last time to add
306:18 - those background images right so we did
306:19 - like this put it like this before
306:23 - right
306:24 - like so
306:25 - right
306:27 - and of course number one I need to give
306:29 - this uh the container to give this a
306:31 - height so the height for this one
306:35 - is gonna be just how did the last time
306:38 - is a hundred VH minus 70 pixels done
306:44 - done okay 100 VH minus 70 pixels that's
306:48 - going to be just how we had to follow
306:49 - these other ones we do the same thing
306:51 - for this one okay
306:53 - okay good before so that's gonna be this
306:56 - relative now before with this specific
306:58 - specific one is we're going to add a
306:59 - background image so let's go and do this
307:01 - so we'll say here we'll say position
307:03 - absolute
307:06 - absolute
307:10 - absolute
307:12 - I will say top zero
307:15 - zero we'll say bottom zero
307:20 - bottom zero
307:22 - okay we'll say content is nothing
307:27 - comes with nothing
307:29 - right the Jaws that we had in the detail
307:31 - page right by the site is just in this
307:33 - case we had the background was like you
307:36 - know we used an image inside that which
307:37 - is completely fine don't worry about
307:38 - that
307:39 - right content is nothing
307:42 - and then we will say go ahead and then
307:44 - bottom left zero
307:47 - right zero as well
307:51 - zero good all right and now check this
307:53 - out now right all right that's supposed
307:55 - to and then we'll do of course this to
307:56 - hold the whole Z index now now this
307:59 - point that's pretty much good so
308:00 - position relative on that that's all
308:02 - good I like the height here nothing
308:04 - crazy here let's do a background image
308:06 - now so say background
308:09 - Dash image
308:12 - okay and we'll give it this URL that's
308:15 - the login we have a background image so
308:17 - we have a special login background image
308:19 - that we have which looks a little bit
308:21 - like this
308:22 - boom
308:24 - right now you don't really see it right
308:26 - now don't worry about that so what's
308:28 - gonna happen now this point is default
308:30 - position absolute top zero bottom zero
308:32 - left zero right zero okay let me make
308:35 - sure it's all good
308:40 - that's all great
308:42 - position
308:44 - before they created before
308:47 - all right let me see or maybe it's after
308:50 - no no no no no no no no no no no no no
308:51 - no no no no no
308:54 - it's like this
308:57 - wait wait wait
308:59 - um it's after
309:05 - hold on
309:06 - before
309:11 - there's no before here that's
309:13 - interesting
309:15 - maybe it's after here
309:17 - let me see maybe it's after you guys see
309:19 - what I'm talking about
309:20 - let's see
309:22 - hmm
309:25 - see how did I do before
309:28 - [Music]
309:32 - let me see am I missing something here
309:36 - before
309:38 - no technically it's good like this
309:40 - before back on URL
309:45 - same thing that was the image slider
309:46 - right here before
309:48 - foreign
309:52 - fixed position absolute top right
309:55 - content zero position relative okay
310:02 - bottom zero okay
310:04 - that's interesting
310:06 - all right let's see so before
310:10 - let's go back to our login page yeah
310:14 - that's right
310:16 - but to our login page here
310:19 - do command P to go back to login
310:23 - okay
310:25 - so the content nothing top zero bottom
310:28 - zero left zero is your background image
310:30 - is that one
310:32 - so do like this
310:40 - okay let's see
310:44 - just don't understand why it's not
310:46 - editing before content let me see
310:47 - content
310:51 - hmm
310:53 - that's very interesting I don't
310:55 - understand why
310:58 - [Music]
311:00 - okay let me move this image for now
311:08 - okay what if I do exactly the way I had
311:09 - it before
311:12 - before
311:14 - I don't understand why otherwise it
311:16 - would just not work let's go to log in
311:18 - the Js
311:19 - log in the Gs let's see you guys do you
311:21 - guys see any issues that I don't see or
311:22 - no or am I blind to this
311:27 - wait now it has a before
311:31 - now I did so what was I doing before
311:32 - that was not right
311:34 - what
311:36 - what I do before
311:38 - same Ampersand Time same colon same
311:40 - before
311:41 - what oh man this is not cool anyway
311:45 - special absolute good okay well I mean
311:49 - I'm not sure without bite that hat but
311:51 - that made that that happens sometimes
311:52 - it's a cold not semicolon absolute is a
311:55 - colon not semicolon oh is that why
311:59 - because I had this one wrong okay
312:01 - interesting so probably because of the
312:02 - thing okay
312:04 - that's fine so let's go ahead and in our
312:07 - login
312:07 - that that makes sense okay so we'll
312:10 - change the background image
312:13 - I do not need this right now
312:15 - good
312:16 - it's a background image
312:21 - Dash image
312:22 - boom
312:24 - oh there we go so much better we'll do a
312:28 - background position top
312:33 - position top
312:35 - okay so start from the top we'll do a
312:38 - background size cover so it covers the
312:40 - full thing so background
312:43 - round
312:45 - size cover
312:48 - okay
312:50 - nice I like every size cover and then
312:52 - Becca said no repeat so does not repeat
312:54 - basically the whole thing at all
312:57 - no repeat
312:59 - no repeat beautiful and that's it we've
313:02 - got ourselves a background which just
313:03 - looks so good now again this right here
313:06 - we'll change later on okay the most
313:08 - important thing is now let's go ahead
313:10 - and change up this stuff so now we need
313:12 - so we have this portion which is great
313:15 - let's focus now on the the actual what's
313:18 - it called the actual content so let's
313:20 - create the content which I'm gonna call
313:22 - the content yeah I'm gonna call it the
313:23 - content box
313:26 - content box
313:28 - that's what I'm gonna call it the
313:30 - content box
313:32 - Okay so
313:35 - content box right here beautiful content
313:38 - box and inside this content box is where
313:41 - for example our logos will be so for
313:43 - example actually maybe let's call it CTA
313:44 - box some of this a call to action box
313:47 - SATA what do you guys think maybe call a
313:49 - CTA for now
313:50 - CTA and inside here we'll have what will
313:53 - have the following we'll have CTA logo
313:56 - one so let's do this CTA logo
314:01 - one as could be an image
314:04 - and then there'll also be a CDA logo two
314:07 - later on so let's start with the CTA
314:08 - logo one which has a source we'll say
314:11 - source is equal to
314:14 - first is equal to
314:17 - right here and there will be right here
314:20 - CTA logo one which we have in our images
314:21 - folder
314:24 - boom done right there CTA okay
314:28 - and I'm just so if you go back to here
314:30 - of course we have an issue here so CTA
314:32 - that means you to create a stock
314:34 - component so let's do so let's go ahead
314:35 - and do this so we'll do const
314:39 - CTA
314:41 - CTA equals styled dot div
314:46 - okay that's part one and then CTA logo
314:49 - one is going to be an image so okay
314:51 - const
314:53 - CTA
314:54 - logo one
314:57 - is equal to what style dot image
315:04 - boom
315:05 - boom hey right there it's okay don't
315:08 - worry this refresh this will work okay
315:10 - good awesome so that's fine that's
315:12 - awesome no problem whatsoever so now
315:13 - with this specific thing let's go ahead
315:15 - and I kind of wanted a um let me think
315:19 - about this here
315:21 - what height should we give it I think we
315:23 - should give it a a specific height I
315:25 - think we should give it I should give it
315:27 - a specific uh height and width so let's
315:28 - do this for the CTA let's do a Max width
315:33 - Max was good to do some Max with
315:37 - of 650 pixels for example
315:44 - okay awesome and I also want to give it
315:48 - a specific uh
315:52 - let's do a top
315:56 - a specific padding on specific padding
315:59 - so let's do padding
316:01 - so top is going to be 80 pixels top
316:04 - bottom 80 pixels
316:05 - and left and right are going to be 40
316:08 - pixels
316:11 - all right there you see
316:13 - I like that okay now so you see this
316:16 - kind of becomes that the whole dynamic
316:18 - here uh but actually
316:20 - yeah that's right yeah that's right yeah
316:23 - so now to make it all work properly what
316:26 - we need to do is uh we need to on this
316:29 - container we need to give the position
316:30 - not position but display Flex
316:34 - Flex to make sure it's all centered and
316:36 - then oh well we'll just go display Flex
316:40 - I know where I just went and then we'll
316:42 - do a line item Center
316:49 - where did the thing just go
316:52 - where'd you go
316:54 - don't leave
316:56 - all right so I'll bring it back okay
316:59 - that's interesting so if I don't if I
317:01 - don't do display Flex it's fine
317:04 - this play
317:07 - relax
317:09 - all right that's fine that's a Justified
317:11 - content maybe as well justify
317:15 - content
317:18 - Center
317:19 - hmm
317:22 - Max with I don't like the fact that CTA
317:26 - is just not showing up just kind of like
317:28 - that so that doesn't make sense at all
317:30 - um
317:32 - this one
317:36 - said the DF that's this one
317:38 - before
317:43 - oh it's here
317:45 - just it does not have a width that's why
317:47 - that's fine we'll give it a whisp we'll
317:49 - give it with right now uh let's give it
317:51 - a width of
317:53 - 58 let's get a width
317:58 - with all let's just say 50 percent
318:03 - there we go let's do more like 60 or
318:05 - something
318:08 - there we go maybe 70.
318:12 - there we go I like that okay that's good
318:14 - I like that okay and of course it's
318:17 - centered right there but you know then
318:19 - once we put another stuff it'll be
318:21 - centered normally so okay just for kind
318:23 - of sentence that's basically it's fully
318:24 - center now in this position that's
318:25 - amazing I like that portion the next I
318:28 - need to do is create the sign up button
318:30 - so that will be inside here so we'll do
318:32 - sign up
318:34 - sign up so create a sign up button so
318:36 - sign up
318:38 - sign up right there and then inside here
318:41 - we'll say get all there remember just
318:43 - like how they had it here so get all
318:44 - there
318:47 - get all there
318:50 - let's increase this width a little bit
318:51 - more
318:53 - maybe like 80 I would say so
318:56 - okay same thing let's do const
319:00 - sign up
319:02 - equals styled dot what style Dot style
319:06 - dot it's gonna be actually it looks like
319:08 - it's an a tag actually
319:09 - it's an a tag
319:11 - right there
319:12 - done right there see
319:14 - all right awesome sweet sweet so that is
319:17 - all great
319:19 - um I like that portion
319:21 - nice so that's gonna be good next thing
319:23 - let's go ahead and actually make that
319:25 - make this into a proper button well to
319:28 - make that happen they get all there we
319:29 - need to give the number one a specific
319:31 - width so let's do that so we'll say
319:33 - width
319:36 - width of a hundred percent
319:39 - okay that's fine I will do a background
319:42 - color
319:48 - and we'll give it this background color
319:49 - which is this one
319:51 - bull right there
319:53 - save that okay again not not nothing
319:57 - crazy right now right but that's again
319:59 - nothing don't worry about that just yet
320:01 - okay we'll do font away here bold
320:05 - font wait
320:07 - bold
320:10 - okay and then what we want to do is

323:26 - too so we'll do another example
323:28 - transition
323:29 - all
323:31 - and then you can do things like for

328:52 - is kind of vertically bonus out of this
328:53 - better a little bit better so we did do
328:55 - a line out of Center but I would rather
328:58 - do it kind of line items top here
329:01 - right minus top just how we have it here
329:04 - and then that's part one and then I kind
329:07 - of want to do it where

330:33 - bit smaller maybe let me see a width of
330:38 - let's see
330:41 - wait 90 percent

330:46 - and then inside here we'll go ahead and
330:49 - do
330:51 - T da
330:55 - da just like content is d8 so we'll do
330:57 - Justified content in the CTA to make
330:59 - sure it's all good
331:02 - Justified no actually align item Center

331:07 - it's not aligned like this you see you
331:09 - see how let me go ahead and remove this
331:10 - for you guys
331:12 - um you secretly it's not aligned or
331:13 - horizontally well we can maybe we can
331:15 - fix it by saying item Center
331:18 - but yeah right there see but not see
331:21 - usually when you do when you do
331:22 - horizontal a line you want to use
331:24 - Justified content Center but because we
331:27 - did a flex Direction column right and
331:30 - then they switch align items changes to
331:33 - horizontal Direction just if a Content
331:35 - changes the vertical Direction so it's
331:36 - actually the switch in terms of uh yeah
331:38 - I know it's just weird like that for
331:39 - some reason but yeah that's pretty much
331:41 - it guys look at this we have ourselves

339:28 - we have the main files let me go ahead
339:30 - and show it to you here
339:33 - detail home page right here home page
339:35 - header image slider login movies and
339:39 - viewers right and all this contribute to
339:42 - application that is pretty much the way
339:44 - it is right now nothing crazy so far
339:46 - because right now our goal is very
339:48 - simple the number one goal I'm going to
339:50 - do is you see how these movies right now
339:53 - are just static files static images
339:57 - we're going to be grabbing them now from
339:59 - the database to make sure we have them
340:02 - basically from the databases what I'm
340:04 - trying to say right
340:05 - we want to have them Dynamic right we
340:08 - don't want to have them static all the
340:09 - time all right okay to make that happen
340:13 - to make that happen we're going to be
340:15 - using Firebase and deep database from
340:18 - the from there right on top of that
340:20 - after we finish with that part two we're
340:22 - going to focus on is go to the detail
340:25 - base when I go to the detail page
340:27 - of course we don't want to see just
340:30 - static content we want to see content
340:33 - that changes based on the mood I click
340:35 - right that's part two part three is
340:37 - going to be login so we're focusing on
340:39 - the login which happens to be right here
340:42 - when I click on this we should be able
340:43 - to log out and I should be able to log
340:45 - in and honestly that is pretty much it
340:48 - for today and once we're done we will go
340:50 - ahead and host our application straight
340:53 - on Firebase and you'll be able to play
340:55 - with it and use it and just be so proud
340:58 - of it to put in your portfolio and so
341:00 - forth
341:00 - all right so our project is here okay
341:05 - to do the whole Firebase getting movies
341:09 - let's do the following let's go ahead
341:12 - and go to home.js okay home.js I will
341:16 - make this a little bit larger home.js
341:20 - on home.gs we need to go ahead and grab
341:25 - the movies that's the functionality
341:27 - we're going to use now to Gap those of
341:30 - course we're going to be grabbing them
341:31 - from the Firebase and right now we have
341:33 - nothing with Firebase related
341:35 - that means we need to install Firebase
341:38 - so create a new terminal right here
341:40 - inside inside your inside your uh what's
341:44 - it called uh your views code
341:46 - and we'll do npm install
341:49 - npm install Firebase
341:52 - done all right
341:54 - we will install that
341:57 - and then we will also add the
341:59 - configuration for the Firebase so let's
342:01 - do npm install
342:03 - install receive install
342:07 - Firebase Dash tools boom voila
342:11 - Firebase Dash tools we got those
342:15 - so those two things NTM install Firebase
342:18 - right here
342:19 - and then npm install Firebase tools both
342:21 - are needed for us to work all right
342:23 - awesome
342:24 - clear this out all right
342:27 - next thing we need to create a
342:30 - firebase.js file because we need the
342:32 - configuration now usually what I would
342:34 - do is I will go ahead and actually show
342:36 - you how to go to Firebase clear your
342:39 - project and so forth but in our case
342:41 - we're not going to do that mainly
342:43 - because a lot of the data all this
342:45 - movie's data there is already
342:47 - pre-popularly in our database and so
342:49 - we'll just give you access to be able to
342:51 - pre-populate your data as well right so
342:54 - it just makes it easier for us and for
342:55 - you at the same time
342:57 - let's create a new file
343:00 - here new file we'll do firebase.js and
343:03 - very important make sure this fiber
343:05 - suggests is not is not inside any of
343:07 - these folders like app or components or
343:09 - features or anything like that it needs
343:11 - to be inside the source folder very
343:13 - important
343:14 - next up as you know we down below we
343:18 - have a Google drive folder that has
343:20 - images and it has a few different things
343:22 - below it let me see let me go ahead
343:24 - right here where's that finder folder oh
343:31 - let's go to downloads here
343:34 - and we had a Disney clone challenge this
343:37 - was exactly the what's it called the the
343:40 - folder you can download down below in
343:42 - the description below okay
343:43 - download that and you have videos images
343:45 - and the next thing you have also is
343:48 - something called firebase.js okay I want
343:52 - you to go ahead and actually open this
343:53 - one up so it's going to open this one up
343:55 - either with Sublime Text or whatever
343:57 - that you use to open it up so I'm going
343:59 - to open up inside vs code
344:02 - right here this is the fiber suggest
344:04 - we're going to use all right
344:06 - so copy this one command C go to
344:10 - firebase.js and paste it in there done
344:13 - right and honestly that's all you need
344:15 - and again it's inside the folder Down
344:19 - Below in the description okay inside
344:21 - that folder the firebase.js okay
344:24 - download that and then paste it in say
344:27 - here so what's going on here
344:29 - in this file a few things we are
344:33 - importing Firebase
344:35 - part one nextly we have a Firebase
344:37 - configuration file right there and this
344:40 - basically just gives us access to the
344:42 - actual database
344:43 - next thing we initialize the Firebase
344:46 - app right here right and then what we do
344:49 - is we we need to tell Firebase so what
344:51 - we're going to be using well the first
344:52 - thing we're going to be using is
344:53 - Firebase firestore so firestore is the
344:56 - actual database we're going to be using
344:58 - Firebase authentication later on to be
345:00 - able to log in and log out
345:01 - we're going to be using Google
345:03 - authentication because like I said
345:05 - fibers can have like Yahoo and
345:07 - application there's like all these
345:08 - Amazon application Facebook
345:09 - authentication in our cases it's just
345:11 - gonna be Google auth okay
345:13 - and finally we're going to be using
345:15 - Firebase Storage storage as well right
345:16 - so those three things is well we need to
345:19 - make sure to tell our project uh to use
345:24 - once we get that does everybody have
345:26 - that let me see does everybody this
345:27 - everybody see the folder or see the file
345:29 - everybody has the file on the zoom there
345:31 - yes yes yes yes beautiful awesome all
345:34 - right next thing once we have that let's
345:37 - go back to now
345:40 - home.gs all right Honda GS
345:43 - and here we need to grab the movies from
345:48 - the database and first is a few things
345:52 - we need to use something called use
345:54 - effect to be able to grab those movies
345:56 - let's go and import use effect here
345:59 - use effect
346:02 - bomb right there use effect which is
346:04 - right here now what this is going to be
346:06 - used for is use the fact that says Hey
346:07 - whenever I load my component whenever I
346:10 - upload my page or all that I will be
346:13 - doing is basically just running whatever
346:16 - you tell me to do right so for example
346:18 - here if I say use effect
346:20 - place a use effect boom and I say it
346:23 - like this
346:24 - okay good and I'm going to put nothing
346:27 - inside here
346:29 - check this out if I simply just do comma
346:31 - and I do console log
346:34 - okay console console.log
346:39 - okay hello
346:41 - all right check this out cancel the look
346:43 - hello far save that and if I refresh
346:46 - this all I have to do refresh this
346:48 - inspect dominant on this one
346:51 - called a console see hello so what this
346:54 - is telling me is this right here is
346:56 - being run whenever this component this
346:59 - whole component it gets loaded
347:02 - right this whole thing is being run
347:04 - that's the reason we use users like
347:06 - otherwise if we don't use use effect it
347:08 - will be very messy a lot of calls
347:11 - getting being called
347:12 - if you want to avoid that all right next
347:15 - thing is since we're using Firebase
347:16 - database let's go ahead and import DB DB
347:19 - from
347:21 - Firebase we need to use Firebase like so
347:24 - so dot dot slash means go back up the
347:26 - folder because Chrome inside the
347:28 - components and then we need to go back
347:30 - up to the source folder to access
347:31 - firebase.gs all right that's part one
347:33 - all right since we got that all right
347:36 - let's go ahead and take a look at how do
347:38 - we grab the data so we'll do DB
347:41 - DB dot collection
347:44 - collection DOT book collection of what
347:47 - we have a collection called movies
347:49 - inside our database
347:52 - and we will say something called on
347:55 - Snapshot what does this mean on Snapshot
347:58 - means whenever it's not just kind of
348:01 - like a picture right you take a picture
348:04 - of whatever it is a landscape or you
348:06 - know uh yourself who knows right take a
348:09 - picture and it's a still picture right
348:12 - and it does not move but it's a certain
348:15 - point in time well what a snapshot does
348:17 - it says it's almost like taking a
348:19 - picture of the database and then
348:20 - returning that picture to you right at
348:23 - that point in time that you called it
348:25 - right the point in time that you called
348:27 - it
348:28 - and now what happens also with it is
348:31 - whenever the picture changes or whenever
348:34 - for example the database changes it will
348:36 - actually
348:38 - send a new picture to you every single
348:40 - time that's the cool thing about
348:41 - Firebase is that's why it's called a
348:43 - live database all right
348:46 - on Snapshot all right and we'll do like
348:49 - this snapshot called a function
348:52 - okay so it's gonna get a snapshot and
348:55 - then I will show it to you what we get
348:58 - from it
348:59 - snapshot oops let me go and times
349:02 - quickly
349:03 - snapshot snapshot snapshot okay good
349:07 - good good good good and
349:10 - well let's go ahead and install log what
349:12 - we actually get you'll see it's a little
349:13 - messy
349:15 - check this out
349:17 - snap shot
349:19 - okay
349:21 - done okay if I go ahead and right click
349:23 - this inspect that one on this one
349:25 - console log what do I get look at this
349:27 - this is what I get right here like I
349:29 - said it's really messy but what do we
349:30 - have here here we have Docs
349:33 - we have empty metadata query and then
349:36 - size right and the main thing we need to
349:38 - look into is docs you see look at this
349:40 - you see this right here it says array of
349:42 - 16 what do you think this means well
349:44 - this just means literally we have 16
349:47 - items in our database right here look
349:50 - right 16 movies but again you don't see
349:53 - them fully it's a little bit odd the way
349:56 - it's made but you'll see that in a
349:58 - second here but we have this 16 elements
350:01 - in the database and we just received
350:03 - them right once we receive them well
350:05 - what's going to happen is let's go let's
350:07 - go ahead and capture them we'll do let
350:09 - temp movies here
350:12 - 10 movies is equal to snapshot
350:16 - snapshot dot docs remember how we talked
350:18 - about the docs portion map and that map
350:22 - will simply Loop through every single
350:24 - snapshot and then we're going to return
350:26 - something from it check this out
350:28 - right here's a little return
350:31 - so for every single dock
350:34 - every single dock
350:36 - that we have and put it on the right
350:37 - hand side
350:40 - for every single dock that we
350:43 - that we are going to use
350:46 - we're going to grab the ID
350:49 - and the data from it so return
350:53 - boom ID
350:56 - doc Dot
350:58 - ID comma
351:01 - dot dot dot data hold the phone as I
351:06 - understand what you're talking about
351:07 - this is very confusing what are we doing
351:09 - here let me show it to you
351:11 - console.log
351:15 - .data
351:18 - all right
351:19 - so the log and check this one out okay
351:23 - inspect on it boom inspect the element
351:26 - on this
351:27 - go to console again
351:30 - look at this you see every single doc
351:32 - that data is is what is the object look
351:36 - at this right here boom
351:38 - you've got the background image the card
351:40 - image description subtitle title these
351:42 - are all movie stored in our database
351:46 - right and that's exactly what we are
351:48 - doing here
351:49 - and so we're capturing that by using
351:52 - doctor data we're capturing that portion
351:54 - but also separately in order to capture
351:57 - the unique ID so we can later on use it
351:59 - for the detail page or capture inside
352:01 - doc.id as well right and this dot dot
352:05 - send simply means basically let's go
352:08 - ahead and unpack this object and put
352:11 - this whole dog the object inside this
352:13 - new object that we created which is
352:15 - simply just an object with the brackets
352:17 - right and then we'll return that back to
352:19 - the 10 movies so we're doing this right
352:21 - here let's go ahead and stop the so lock
352:23 - here
352:25 - I will do consult a log
352:29 - cancel the log
352:31 - temp movies
352:34 - okay
352:35 - save that
352:37 - all right boom right there look 10
352:39 - movies is exactly what we now need we
352:43 - have the ID
352:44 - the ID of the actual movie the ID is
352:47 - used for
352:49 - identification inside the database we
352:51 - have a description the card image the
352:53 - background image pretty much everything
352:54 - we need for the detail page and also for
352:56 - this page as well and honestly that is
353:00 - it that is it my friends right but of
353:03 - course
353:04 - we're not done right we have these
353:07 - movies and that's great right
353:09 - how we go have it and show them now I'm
353:12 - here how do we do that
353:15 - well this is now where Redux comes in
353:18 - and this is the interesting portion okay
353:20 - and I want you to pay attention to this
353:22 - really quickly here
353:24 - a Redix is basically what's going to
353:26 - manage all the data so if you imagine
353:28 - this right if you imagine the fact that
353:30 - if you have a rectangle here and if you
353:32 - imagine that this right here is state
353:33 - I'm going to make this of course this
353:36 - for here State okay this is called State
353:39 - and state is basically a database DB for
353:43 - your app
353:45 - but internal app basically for your it's
353:47 - basically DB for database inside Chrome
353:49 - right and inside State we have what we
353:52 - have things like we have different
353:55 - um values maybe we have movies inside
353:57 - the state oop not here uh
354:00 - maybe we have movies maybe we have you
354:04 - know user maybe we have uh I don't know
354:08 - some kind of other list maybe right
354:11 - um all of that is actually being saved
354:13 - so for example here I'm gonna say movies
354:15 - movies maybe for example we have user
354:17 - right
354:19 - the application State sees all that and
354:23 - so and manages all that right and
354:25 - because we save it in the global state
354:27 - in the application State we can access
354:29 - the average weight that we need
354:32 - that is the important part here this is
354:34 - why Redux is so useful because otherwise
354:37 - if we don't do that then we have to pass
354:39 - down data from movies
354:41 - down to movies here and you're passing
354:44 - down data every single time and that's a
354:46 - lot right that is not very good that's
354:48 - not very useful
354:50 - and that's why relax is so important
354:53 - okay now at this point since we do have
354:55 - Redux let's go ahead and take a look at
354:57 - what do we create with it well
354:59 - if you look at Firebase and I'm sorry if
355:02 - you look at Redux
355:04 - readers has a few things when we did the
355:07 - Redux toolkit when we use the template
355:10 - Redux template right here you see it
355:12 - created a temporary one called counter
355:15 - boom let me go remove some force me Kana
355:19 - right here and if I click into it it has
355:21 - something called counter slice
355:23 - and we have the initial State here
355:26 - and so forth
355:28 - we're going to mock this up and I want
355:30 - to show you exactly how it works let's
355:32 - create a new file here a new folder
355:33 - actually we'll call it movie
355:36 - okay movie
355:38 - oh actually not inside here but inside
355:40 - the features so new photos inside the
355:42 - features not bad we'll call it movie
355:45 - boom not inside the counter remove this
355:47 - one delete this one I don't want that
355:49 - boom
355:51 - okay counter movie Inside here create
355:54 - new file called movie slice
355:56 - and I know you might be wondering what
355:58 - is movies like so why is why is it
356:00 - called the slice I'll explain a little
356:01 - bit why all right
356:03 - and inside movie slice uh a few things
356:06 - we need to do is we need to import
356:12 - create slice
356:16 - create slice
356:20 - slice there we go from
356:23 - Redux toolkit so from at Redux
356:27 - Redux right JS slash
356:31 - tool kit done all right so crease live
356:35 - for midax Slash 2 Kit and honestly
356:38 - that's it and so usually we have a three
356:41 - Ducks is a few things we always start
356:44 - out with initial State like when I say
356:46 - state is what do we have at first what
356:48 - do we have in our data in in our Chrome
356:50 - database or in our application database
356:52 - well we always start out with nothing so
356:55 - we say const initial state
356:58 - initial state
357:00 - is equal to bump initial state is equal
357:03 - to and we're going to give a movies key
357:07 - it's not right it's nothing right we
357:09 - start off with nothing initially
357:11 - okay
357:13 - once we have that
357:15 - we're actually going to create the
357:16 - slides for the movie so what does this
357:18 - mean so let's go let me take a look at
357:19 - this const movie slice
357:21 - will we slice is equal to create slice
357:26 - and you're like holy this is so
357:28 - much I don't get it it's as complicated
357:30 - as hell all right don't worry don't
357:32 - worry I'll explain this let's create
357:33 - let's name this slice here
357:36 - I'm going to name this slice
357:38 - called movie so name
357:40 - I'm going to name a movie
357:42 - boom comma and I'm going to pass the
357:45 - initial State that's going to be loaded
357:46 - with initial State boom comma
357:50 - and I'm going to give the a reducer now
357:53 - what is a reducer
357:55 - check this out
357:57 - okay
357:58 - um well very simple
358:02 - Redux is made of a few things
358:05 - actions
358:07 - actions
358:09 - reducers
358:12 - users
358:13 - and State
358:15 - right actions reducers and state there's
358:18 - also something called sagas but we don't
358:21 - really care about that too much here
358:22 - that was previous Redux okay
358:25 - actually this real estate and action is
358:27 - basically the action you want to do so
358:29 - for example right if you want to I don't
358:32 - know create a movie if you want to set
358:35 - the new movie if you want to delete a
358:37 - movie if you want to log a user out if
358:38 - you want to log a user in this is called
358:41 - the action this is called actions okay
358:44 - you want to log them in you want to log
358:46 - them out you want to sign them in you
358:48 - want to save the data it's called
358:49 - actions right now reducers reducers are
358:53 - basically is what takes an action and
358:56 - actually changes the state so it kind of
358:57 - kind of goes kind of like goes like this
358:59 - let me show you actions
359:02 - foreign
359:08 - call reducers reducers change the state
359:11 - and so forth that's honestly what
359:12 - happens right and now it does not make
359:15 - it's nothing more complicated than that
359:17 - right
359:18 - one way I can show it to you is really
359:20 - cool like this on the right hand side
359:21 - you can see here that this right here is
359:23 - an action it's called dispatch so we
359:25 - usually dispatch in action it's like you
359:27 - you're dispatching your driver right
359:28 - right you dispatch an action it goes to
359:32 - the action right here there's a type
359:33 - deposit it goes to the store the reducer
359:36 - the reducer right here changes the state
359:40 - to ten dollars see so again we click on
359:43 - something dispatch is in action oh let
359:45 - me go ahead right this budget is an
359:47 - action boom boom reduce or change the
359:49 - data the state now ten dollars
359:52 - that's obviously this is the whole thing
359:54 - dispatch
359:56 - right reducer changes the data in the
359:59 - state
360:00 - and that is pretty much it and we change
360:02 - it in the UI
360:04 - and that's it the coolest part about
360:06 - this is because whenever I change the
360:08 - state here right
360:11 - basically the whole app knows about it
360:13 - the whole app right so let's say for
360:15 - example I have a home page that has some
360:17 - data
360:18 - I have a home page that has some data
360:20 - right and the reducer said hey the
360:23 - movie's changed right so we uploaded new
360:26 - movies or whatever it might be
360:28 - what will happen is every single
360:30 - component will get notified about that
360:32 - and so now you can make the changes
360:34 - really fast and really quickly and you
360:36 - don't have to listen on everything
360:37 - and that's what makes it so powerful
360:39 - okay
360:41 - all right continuing on so does that
360:43 - make sense is this a better description
360:44 - of kind of what we like says this is a
360:46 - relationship does that make sense raise
360:47 - your hand is that a little bit better to
360:48 - understand yeah a lot better okay good
360:50 - good I know it's a little bit hard it's
360:52 - this one is usually a little hard to
360:54 - understand but all you have to know is
360:56 - we have actions that to basically what
360:59 - you want to do so kind of what you want
361:00 - to do let's say I want to walk I want to
361:02 - walk so I'm walking walking walking and
361:04 - then maybe I want to for example buy
361:05 - something or I want to buy something
361:07 - then the reducer is what allows me to do
361:09 - that okay
361:11 - all right so we have initial State let's
361:13 - create those reducers
361:15 - boom
361:17 - let's create those reducers
361:19 - all right all right we're going to
361:22 - create a reducer called set movies
361:25 - and what this will do is
361:27 - we'll take a
361:29 - parameter called state so this is the
361:32 - current state comma action right
361:38 - common action and this is a function
361:40 - right here pretty much right and what's
361:42 - going to happen is this is where we
361:43 - change the state so in the sample is
361:45 - function we're going to pass in new
361:46 - movies that we get from the database
361:48 - it's as simple as that so to stay the
361:51 - movies
361:55 - is equal to
361:57 - action dot payload
362:02 - actually that payload all it is is
362:04 - that's the actual
362:05 - parameter that we pass into the
362:07 - summaries function you'll see that later
362:08 - on that's what pill pillow carries so if
362:10 - I pass in an array into some movies I
362:13 - will get it here it's an action.payload
362:14 - that's what will happen
362:16 - next up in order to actually use the
362:18 - movie slides we have to export the
362:20 - actions because remember we dispatch
362:22 - actions right so I'm going to say export
362:24 - const
362:27 - right here const and I'm going to say
362:29 - here
362:31 - said movies
362:33 - right is equal to movie slice movie
362:37 - slice dot actions
362:40 - boom there right so this is the ash that
362:42 - we're going to export next thing is we
362:45 - need to now export the actual movie
362:48 - State itself because remember how do we
362:51 - use a component to access our movie
362:53 - State work very simply we have to export
362:55 - it so export
362:56 - and
362:59 - the gist of it is we usually like to say
363:01 - something like for example select movies
363:03 - right that's kind of like the
363:06 - the the traditional tradition but that's
363:09 - the way you want to do it select
363:10 - something so what are you selecting from
363:12 - the state is it movies maybe there was
363:14 - something else say for example like I
363:16 - don't know uh horror movies
363:19 - right
363:20 - movies in here right well you would do a
363:22 - select horror movies inside here
363:24 - whatever it might be right
363:25 - that's it
363:26 - okay so select movies is equal to
363:31 - here we'll take the state
363:34 - and we'll say it's state and all it is
363:37 - is state
363:39 - oh state DOT what state well the movie
363:43 - state right movie status is the reducer
363:46 - right state of movie
363:48 - dot movies
363:51 - done
363:54 - okay
363:56 - this will give us back the movies okay
363:57 - next okay we're going to export the
364:00 - actual slice itself so export the actual
364:02 - reducer export default so by default
364:04 - we're going to export the reducer movie
364:05 - slice
364:07 - dot reducer right
364:10 - the reason why we do that is because we
364:11 - need to tell the store we call the store
364:14 - the whole store that we have this right
364:16 - here reducer
364:19 - save that awesome sweet let's now go
364:22 - back to our app
364:24 - go to storage yes and we need to now
364:27 - import that store actually
364:29 - right we need to import that store or
364:31 - input that reducer and we can do that
364:33 - very simply just by simply going
364:35 - okay let's do it like this
364:37 - so import
364:39 - whilst a movie reducer
364:43 - right movie reducer from
364:46 - voyages are from
364:49 - features features Dash movie Dash
364:54 - movie slice
364:57 - okay and then inside of these counters
364:59 - because which came originally we just
365:01 - say movie is equal to the movie reducer
365:04 - and all you're telling the application
365:06 - is that we have this reducer at our
365:08 - disposal that's it
365:09 - that is all you are saying my friends
365:14 - all right that's great
365:16 - let's actually see if this works
365:18 - I'm going to save this
365:20 - I'm Gonna Save this
365:22 - refresh it all right so nothing's broken
365:24 - so far which is good nothing's broken so
365:27 - far the main thing is going to happen is
365:29 - when we actually use the movie reducer
365:31 - which we will do inside the home.js
365:34 - basically whenever we are right whenever
365:38 - we are getting movies this is we will be
365:41 - able to set the movies for the whole
365:43 - state the whole state because then it
365:45 - can be accessed everywhere inside our
365:48 - application right so inside our home
365:49 - page let's say we have a home page here
365:51 - right that's the home page
365:53 - the home page and now we have for
365:55 - example the movies component right two
365:57 - different components we have components
365:58 - movies component and a home component so
366:00 - let me say here this is for example the
366:02 - home component this is the movies
366:03 - component
366:06 - Right Moves component well they both
366:09 - share they both share the same store
366:12 - right which contains movies
366:16 - right so what happens is that inside the
366:18 - home functionality
366:20 - okay
366:23 - inside the home functionality all I do
366:25 - is I hey I set new movies right using
366:29 - this the reducer and then because of
366:31 - that I can actually get movies inside
366:33 - the moves component that's it that's all
366:35 - that happens all right
366:37 - boom awesome all right so let's go ahead
366:40 - and do that now to use the reducer we
366:42 - need to use something called dispatch so
366:43 - let's go ahead and do this we'll say
366:45 - import
366:47 - right and we'll say use dispatch
366:51 - right there use dispatch
366:54 - okay from Redux
366:58 - react Dash Redux
367:01 - all right and then we will import the
367:05 - set movies
367:06 - action so import
367:09 - right there
367:10 - set movies okay from
367:15 - what is it dot
367:17 - features
367:19 - Dash what movie Dash what movie slice
367:24 - right
367:25 - but there was a movie Dash
367:29 - movie slides right there beautiful
367:32 - okay we got the action which is set
367:33 - movies we've got the use dispatch which
367:35 - we're going to use to dispatch that
367:37 - action so this place like basically
367:39 - calling it it's like hey do this action
367:41 - that's what this patch is used for all
367:44 - right and then honestly that is pretty
367:47 - pretty much it uh we've got this badge
367:49 - we've got that right
367:51 - to use this patch we need to say that we
367:54 - say const dispatch is equal to use
367:58 - dispatch oop not that one
368:01 - this patch
368:03 - [Music]
368:05 - it's better good good we got that
368:09 - now so let's think about this right once
368:11 - I get my movies inside you know in from
368:14 - the database what I need to do well it's
368:16 - very simple at this point now I need to
368:17 - that's this that that aspect A dispatch
368:20 - in action right called set movies to set
368:23 - the movies for the whole store for the
368:25 - whole database that's what we need to do
368:27 - does that make sense anybody question
368:29 - does that make sense yes yes yes which
368:31 - is dispatch in action saying hey you
368:32 - know what let's we got these moves from
368:34 - the database let's go ahead and then
368:37 - store them inside the whole state the
368:40 - global State okay
368:42 - this is where we'll do like this we'll
368:44 - say dispatch dispatch right dispatch and
368:48 - we'll say set movies
368:50 - right and this will have temp movies
368:53 - inside here Tempo movies you get 10
368:56 - movies
368:57 - okay
368:59 - and let's go and check out make sure
369:00 - nothing's broken let me see not does
369:02 - anything break let's rock the inspect
369:04 - element anything break oop I forgot to
369:06 - share here so here's what we did we did
369:08 - this batch
369:10 - we did dispatch right here okay and then
369:14 - we did dispatch submoo is right here
369:16 - okay that's we just did and we imported
369:18 - sub moves and use dispatch beautiful all
369:21 - right all right so if we go to console
369:23 - here
369:26 - no bad ears just good this is a good
369:29 - sign nothing's nothing's going haywire
369:31 - which is a good sign right but of course
369:33 - we still don't know how is this working
369:35 - well
369:36 - that's actually now use the Redux in
369:39 - terms of actual uses the state
369:41 - that we can use the same state between
369:44 - the movies component and the home
369:45 - component well go to movies
369:49 - okay
369:50 - go to movies and let's use select movies
369:53 - so
369:55 - when I say import
369:59 - select movies that will get us the
370:01 - movies that we stored in the database
370:02 - select
370:04 - movies
370:06 - from
370:07 - from what well dot
370:10 - features slash slash what movie slash
370:16 - movie slice right movie slice again
370:18 - where's this coming from I mean go to
370:21 - movie slides here movie slice
370:24 - boom look at this see select movies
370:26 - select movies all all that's doing is
370:29 - that's cool getting us the movie State
370:31 - that's it that's all it is doing that's
370:33 - pretty much it right
370:35 - let's do here
370:37 - that's all that it's doing so let's now
370:39 - go back to uh where was I at hours at
370:42 - Movies component boom all right
370:46 - that's good next up is we need to
370:49 - actually to use the selector we need to
370:50 - use a use selector so import
370:53 - I know it's a little complicated guys
370:54 - there's so much to it right but once you
370:57 - know it for the first time or want to
370:58 - kind of realize how it works it's not
371:00 - that bad oh come on
371:04 - you selector from
371:07 - again react Dash Redux
371:11 - beautiful
371:12 - okay
371:14 - the three Ducks save that there we go
371:16 - you selector and let's now grab those
371:19 - movies okay
371:21 - we'll say constant movies this is where
371:23 - we're going together with so constant
371:24 - movies is equal to use selector the one
371:28 - we just imported from here react Redux
371:30 - okay and the selector will be select
371:34 - movies that's on that's the one we need
371:35 - to use
371:36 - select
371:38 - movies
371:39 - okay and let's check this out I'm going
371:42 - to consult a log here
371:45 - to the log
371:46 - right there
371:48 - right there I'm saying this is movies
371:50 - right comma I'm gonna say move just so
371:52 - you guys can see it okay
371:53 - oh no no no no not that
371:55 - boom
371:57 - all right save that inspect element
372:01 - console
372:03 - oh look at that this is movies at Ray
372:06 - 16. we have the moves you see how it
372:09 - traveled between the global State we
372:11 - have the global state right so what do
372:14 - we do here we went down to the home
372:16 - state home component right inside the
372:19 - home component we grabbed here so the
372:21 - home component we grabbed the data right
372:23 - here okay we grab the the data from the
372:26 - database we dispatched an action we used
372:29 - Redux to save the movies inside
372:32 - basically the store right the react
372:35 - store right it's kind of like a store
372:37 - where you buy things right you can buy
372:39 - things you can put things in there you
372:40 - can buy things from there right
372:42 - we put the movies to the store right
372:45 - once we put that there if we now go back
372:48 - to movies component
372:50 - right we just now grab from the store we
372:54 - grab it from that store that is it
372:56 - that's happening here
372:58 - what do you guys think about does that
372:59 - make sense does that make sense kind of
373:01 - iffy yes or no raise your hand if it
373:04 - kind of makes sense right yes yes okay
373:07 - good I know I know it's a little bit
373:08 - iffy to fully understand videos it takes
373:11 - a few days it takes a few I mean
373:12 - sometimes it takes a week to fully
373:13 - understand it
373:15 - okay but we have the movies which is
373:17 - great
373:18 - all right
373:19 - we have those once we get those of
373:22 - course we need to replace these static
373:23 - images now right now how do we do that
373:25 - well that's pretty simple we can do that
373:27 - by doing a wrap a basically a loop
373:30 - through them so we'll do the following
373:32 - we'll do let's see this so we'll do
373:34 - movies
373:36 - so we'll check if the movies exist right
373:39 - and then if the moves exist we'll say
373:41 - like this movies and
373:44 - or say this
373:46 - movies.map check this out
373:49 - movies the map
373:52 - okay
373:54 - and this will take in a movie
373:58 - okay oh I should not not like that
374:01 - taking a movie and it will actually no
374:03 - come on now there we go thank you all
374:06 - right and the wrap is actually the rap
374:09 - which is currently directly the rap is
374:11 - what the rap is this right that's the
374:13 - whole thing right
374:15 - so doing it here we'll put it inside
374:16 - here
374:17 - boom boom boom boom okay all right there
374:22 - you go okay
374:24 - all right so what's going on here this
374:28 - functionality says hey if movies exist
374:30 - then you can go ahead and proceed with
374:32 - doing something about it right but if
374:34 - movies is null because in the beginning
374:36 - with the when the page loads the movies
374:38 - is no right we haven't gotten it from
374:40 - the database yet once we did get it from
374:42 - the database we simply just Loop through
374:44 - it right here
374:45 - that's it that's it all right and as we
374:49 - Loop through it we use a map function to
374:50 - Loop through it get the movie and let's
374:53 - now actually get the movie data right so
374:55 - we'll say the following the source image
374:58 - remember how we can still log The Source
374:59 - image let's go ahead and remove this
375:01 - portion don't need this
375:04 - that it will be what
375:08 - movie Dot what card image
375:13 - okay let me go ahead and just
375:15 - oh do you see what just happened right
375:19 - here guys
375:20 - look at that
375:21 - look at that
375:24 - just like that
375:26 - it just worked do I see right we love
375:29 - the most can you hear me Jesse
375:31 - that's amazing yeah I can hear you
375:33 - beautiful beautiful right so
375:37 - it's just all working the way you should
375:39 - be
375:40 - let me make sure that I want to give it
375:41 - to you there we go awesome you hear me
375:42 - Jesse okay good you can hear me yeah I
375:44 - can hear you yeah yeah and what did we
375:46 - just do here like I said we grabbed the
375:47 - move from here and I'm going to consult
375:49 - the log
375:50 - saw the log
375:53 - movies
375:57 - okay
375:59 - likely is an aspect element right
376:02 - this camera oh no console
376:07 - something happened each child okay we'll
376:09 - take care of this a second but here are
376:10 - the movies right we have the ID we have
376:14 - the subtitle right and what we use from
376:17 - the movie is we use the movie the car
376:18 - damage right so if you look at it here
376:20 - the card image so that's what we used
376:22 - that's what we said card image right
376:24 - here card image you see
376:26 - that's exactly what we need to use right
376:28 - there all right and honestly that's
376:31 - that's pretty much it all right but of
376:33 - course we're not done yet so a few
376:34 - things I want to fix together here it
376:36 - says here you see how there's an error
376:37 - that says here well each child
376:41 - each child in a list should have a
376:43 - unique key prop what does that mean well
376:45 - Redux underneath the hood tracks all of
376:48 - these components all these components
376:50 - right if there's any changes that happen
376:52 - to them but attracts them through a key
376:55 - like a unique key and to give unique key
376:58 - we need to do something like this so
376:59 - we'll say key is equal to and we need to
377:02 - give a unique key and what's the most
377:04 - unique thing that we have about a movie
377:06 - what is it put in the chat what is the
377:09 - most unique thing that we have about a
377:10 - movie
377:11 - individual movie Object
377:13 - it's the ID that's correct
377:15 - so I will say to get the ID well
377:17 - actually we'll grab the index here I
377:19 - mean I don't think you could move that
377:20 - ID so we'll say movie here
377:23 - movie dot ID
377:26 - that's it so save that
377:28 - boom let's see inspect element and let's
377:31 - take a look if that era appears still MC
377:34 - console
377:35 - okay that's the old ear so if I refresh
377:38 - this
377:40 - oh yeah no air you see no more errors
377:43 - now it's all working perfect the way it
377:44 - should all right so we have done that
377:47 - portion we've grabbed the movies from
377:49 - the database they're in our possession
377:52 - we have it all right only thing is left
377:55 - at this point is when I click on them I
377:57 - should be able to go to a detailed page
377:59 - so I can see the eventual movie uh
378:01 - object basically that's the whole goal
378:03 - about this right
378:05 - right there and of course let's go ahead
378:06 - and remove all all these uh Simpsons
378:08 - once because it just looks like our
378:10 - Disney clone is full of Simpsons which
378:12 - is not the case
378:13 - so let's go and do this so wrap let's
378:16 - remove all these Simpsons don't need
378:17 - that
378:18 - bye bye that's funny all right save that
378:22 - oh just happened I just removed all
378:25 - notes right here there you go all right
378:27 - save that okay good good no more
378:29 - symptoms thank God I mean nothing
378:31 - against sepsis I love Simpsons guys okay
378:33 - [Music]
378:35 - nothing against Simpsons guys
378:39 - all right next up uh what do we have is
378:43 - let's go ahead and add our code here so
378:46 - add
378:47 - uh add
378:49 - grab movies
378:51 - from DB we'll put that into our GitHub
378:55 - save beautiful
378:57 - all right all right number two that
379:00 - we're going to work on is let's look on
379:01 - the detail page so we need to create a
379:03 - link here when I click on this specific
379:04 - thing I should be able to go to the
379:06 - detail page of the specific image of
379:09 - what I clicked on so the specific right
379:11 - movie
379:12 - uh won't be that hard we will use react
379:15 - router down for that as well and the way
379:17 - we do it is something called a link
379:19 - this also will say a link here so import
379:21 - import link we've used reactor zombie
379:24 - previously but now we're going to use
379:25 - the link portion of it
379:27 - link right here okay from
379:31 - what react Dash router
379:36 - router
379:37 - Dash Dom
379:39 - that's dumb okay
379:42 - and really what a link is basically it
379:44 - surrounds the object with an attack
379:47 - honestly that that's all it does
379:50 - we can do that here so I will say inside
379:53 - the wrap
379:54 - I will say let's link it
379:58 - will do
379:59 - the link like so boom put the image
380:03 - inside the link
380:04 - of course
380:09 - okay save that put it like this
380:13 - okay
380:16 - and link to What specifically this is
380:18 - what we need to specify we'll link it to
380:19 - what well how do you think we're going
380:21 - to link it well we have the detail page
380:25 - let me go to the app.js right
380:28 - inside your detail page but what if we
380:31 - passed in a detailed slash ID a lot of
380:33 - times we will do detail slash and we'll
380:35 - do give an ID like this
380:38 - oh come on Rocket I don't need you right
380:40 - now
380:43 - right slash ID
380:45 - and this ready is going to be the
380:46 - parameter we pass in into our detail
380:49 - component all right let's go back to
380:51 - movie
380:52 - uh yes movies
380:55 - okay
380:56 - and we'll say Link and Link to link to
381:00 - and we'll give it the link so here's the
381:02 - link right so let's think about this
381:03 - right we'll say it's detail so slash
381:06 - detail right
381:08 - right detail
381:10 - slash what the ID of the movie so right
381:13 - here we're going to use template
381:15 - literals
381:17 - then movie dot ID boom
381:20 - right there so all it will tell us is it
381:24 - will link us to the detail and then
381:25 - division movie ID right so we're going
381:27 - to Loop to every single movie I get the
381:29 - ID from the movie and then put it inside
381:30 - the link towards the detail page and
381:33 - honest honestly that's that's it that's
381:35 - it we're done with that portion it's as
381:37 - simple as that let's go and right click
381:39 - this I want to show it to you guys right
381:40 - click on it inspect element
381:44 - look at this you see this Ace draft tag
381:46 - right here look at this see this
381:49 - no this one here right there detail page
381:52 - and this 30ay is in the visual linked to
381:56 - the movie If I go to a different movie
381:58 - the link will be different because of
381:59 - course the ID is different right so this
382:01 - is 530 aui this is 5n and honestly
382:04 - that's pretty much it that's all we got
382:06 - to do
382:07 - that's it comprehendo that's it right so
382:11 - if I go back to here
382:15 - we have our link right there beautiful
382:18 - okay say that Tata
382:21 - okay save that all right we have that
382:25 - all right so now if we click on it
382:28 - should technically take as a detail page
382:30 - okay are you ready for this are you
382:32 - ready
382:33 - are you ready
382:36 - so click on it
382:38 - oh let's go look at that it took us
382:41 - direct the detail page but of course
382:43 - it's not the correct image still right
382:45 - so like it's not the correct one so it's
382:47 - just the same one but the reason why
382:49 - that's the case is because if we now go
382:51 - to the detail page what
382:53 - right of course it's all static content
382:56 - right
382:57 - but look at this it's starting to come
382:59 - together really nicely is you click on
383:01 - individual movie right there it takes
383:03 - you to the page that you want us to take
383:05 - it to and honestly that's it that's all
383:07 - we need to know specifically look at
383:09 - that that's so good guys what do you
383:11 - guys think so far give me a thumbs up in
383:13 - the comments below if you guys are
383:14 - liking what you just seems so far give a
383:16 - thumbs up there we go beautiful
383:17 - beautiful beautiful
383:19 - all right all right now let's focus on
383:23 - the detail page right here okay
383:27 - um a few things since we're passing the
383:29 - ID you see how here
383:31 - we have the ID that's the ID okay
383:35 - we need to capture that idea because we
383:37 - need to get grab all the data about the
383:39 - specific movie so here's what we'll do
383:42 - I'm going to say like this
383:44 - okay
383:45 - Papa
383:48 - we're going to use use parameters from
383:50 - reactor Dom so import
383:54 - oh
383:56 - import you use params
384:00 - use programs
384:03 - from
384:05 - all right from what react Dash router
384:08 - Dash Dom save it all right
384:11 - next one const
384:14 - and we'll grab the ID this is the smart
384:16 - thing about react Rotterdam and knows
384:18 - this kind of stuff because we in the
384:21 - inside the app that GSB told it that the
384:23 - what's going to happen after the detail
384:26 - link is the ID it will save it actually
384:29 - in the parameter that's the cool part
384:32 - let's go back to the detail
384:36 - and we'll say use params
384:39 - use params right there and we'll grab
384:41 - the ID from it so now if I go go ahead
384:43 - and do console.log
384:45 - console.log ID
384:48 - so technically
384:51 - that's it
384:52 - technically ID let's go ahead and expect
384:55 - them on this one
384:58 - okay
385:00 - expect them on this one let's go ahead
385:01 - and go to console
385:04 - all right
385:05 - prop type the prop 2 is marked as
385:08 - required in Lincoln but its value is
385:10 - undefined no that's different okay
385:12 - there's the idea right here that's all
385:14 - we got to do see we got we grabbed the
385:15 - ID that's it all right save it beautiful
385:20 - okay next up
385:22 - we need to again grab the data for this
385:25 - specific movie right and we're going to
385:27 - use use effect so let's go ahead and
385:29 - code to react or say use effect here
385:33 - use effect okay again
385:36 - so let's do use effect because we need
385:38 - to grab the data individual data right
385:41 - right there and this needs to happen
385:44 - whenever we load the component the
385:47 - component the detail component
385:49 - specifically
385:50 - okay this empty bracket means call this
385:54 - functionality whenever you load the
385:56 - component I just want you to make sure
385:57 - you understand that
385:58 - next thing inside here we need to grab
386:01 - grab the movies the movie movie info
386:05 - from DB
386:06 - from the DB from database right there
386:09 - to do that let's import DB from Firebase
386:12 - import
386:15 - B from okay
386:18 - Firebase okay
386:22 - and to grab the data bit the movies
386:24 - database we'll say DB dot collection
386:28 - collection okay and with the collection
386:32 - we use it's called movies
386:33 - right that's coming from database
386:35 - directly
386:37 - okay
386:38 - beautiful we'll give it a specific dock
386:41 - we need to use so dot doc
386:44 - Doc and the ID that's it DOC ID right
386:49 - this is directly going to convert it
386:51 - from here right it's kind of like
386:52 - telling you hey grabbing the movie with
386:54 - this specific ID dog yet
386:58 - right there dot then
387:02 - so once we get it we're going to grab it
387:05 - and then we're going to use it now right
387:09 - the dog is going to be inside the
387:10 - functionality here
387:12 - and what we need to do is we need to
387:14 - check if this dock exists so we'll say
387:17 - if doc
387:19 - doc dot exists meaning if found the
387:22 - specific document or the specific yeah
387:25 - the specific entry with that ID
387:28 - we're going to use it now so if that
387:30 - exists we'll say what
387:33 - well we need to
387:35 - save the movie data save the movie data
387:38 - but how guys do you think we should see
387:40 - this inside do you think we should save
387:42 - inside the Redux or do you think we
387:43 - should save it actually inside the state
387:45 - what do you guys think Redux or state if
387:48 - you think it's going to be Redux raise
387:49 - your hand here
387:51 - okay everything is if you think it's
387:53 - going to be State raise your hand now
387:55 - what do you think or give me a thumbs up
387:57 - it's actually going to be in state
387:58 - here's why because
388:01 - this changes for every single right page
388:05 - this changes right we're not going to
388:08 - reuse the movie data
388:10 - anywhere else besides on this page so we
388:13 - don't need to save inside no the actual
388:15 - Redux instead we're going to use State
388:17 - okay to use that we need to you to use
388:20 - state
388:21 - you state right there
388:23 - okay we're going to grab it so we'll say
388:26 - uh what is that what are we going to do
388:28 - uh do const
388:30 - right there cast movie movie sub movie
388:35 - that's how we go ahead and I will say
388:37 - equal use state
388:40 - okay
388:41 - so you stay is basically like Redux but
388:44 - for individual components okay for
388:46 - individual small components if Redux is
388:49 - for the whole app okay and it's shared
388:52 - amongst all the components your state is
388:55 - basically for individual component so
388:56 - it's on a smaller scale okay and it was
389:00 - made for three different reasons it just
389:02 - makes things easier sometimes okay
389:04 - and what we get here this is the movie
389:06 - that we will use and if we want to
389:08 - change the movie we use sub movie so in
389:10 - our case since we get the movie we'll do
389:12 - set movie right I will do dog dot data
389:18 - that's it
389:20 - save that all right okay and otherwise
389:24 - however if it does not exist for example
389:25 - let's just say that I don't know the
389:27 - movie does not exist
389:29 - we're going to basically redirect
389:33 - direct to home page
389:35 - for some reason let's just say it does
389:37 - not work out right
389:38 - well in our case let's go and check out
389:40 - what we do so I will say here consult
389:42 - the log
389:43 - console.log
389:47 - movie is
389:50 - movie is what
389:52 - movie right here okay save that all
389:56 - right check this out inspect them on
389:57 - this one
389:59 - let's go and do console
390:01 - oh movie is object right there look at
390:04 - that boom right there so this ID
390:07 - right this idea give us a specific
390:10 - object we need right there this is the
390:12 - object we need holy moly that's so cool
390:15 - right
390:16 - pick up grab that oh oh that's not one
390:19 - okay I know what happened there
390:21 - so that's it
390:23 - once we have the movie right because
390:25 - again we use set movie
390:27 - to save us at the movie Object right
390:29 - here once we have that we now we need to
390:32 - use the that date the specific data
390:34 - right
390:35 - and now it's very simple inside here
390:38 - instead of doing a static image we
390:40 - replace that with a normal image so
390:43 - image source was a movie dot open now
390:46 - like this okay
390:47 - movie that's what background image but
390:52 - background
390:54 - image
390:57 - oh yes save it
390:59 - oh look at that this is the exact movie
391:03 - that we clicked on guys the exact move
391:05 - we clicked on is that background image
391:07 - right next one image title will do movie
391:11 - right there
391:16 - right
391:17 - right or say what movie
391:20 - Dot
391:22 - title image save that
391:26 - boom look at that guys now it's Tangled
391:30 - you see how it's doing
391:33 - all right next up
391:35 - we need to change now this specific
391:37 - portion right this specific portion
391:39 - so what is what is this going to be
391:41 - movie dot what that subtitle
391:45 - grab it movie dot subtitle
391:49 - boom right there okay
391:51 - oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
391:52 - wait wait wait wait and then a spell
391:54 - right sub title which is going to be
391:56 - this one right here subtitle okay boom
391:59 - right there look fantasy animation and
392:01 - finally last I'm gonna be moved the
392:02 - description
392:04 - so we'll say here
392:06 - movie
392:08 - right there
392:10 - movie The What description
392:14 - done that is it guys that's it our
392:18 - detail page is now premium is finished
392:20 - that's it look at and look at how
392:23 - beautiful
392:24 - it looks
392:26 - you see
392:27 - the steps we took we grabbed the ID once
392:31 - we got the ID we grab from the database
392:33 - right
392:34 - like I said
392:36 - let me see look at a mistake let's think
392:37 - about this here two
392:40 - we got so here so here
392:43 - grab ID
392:45 - grab ID right
392:47 - then grab from DB right and populate
392:52 - populate
392:54 - populate data or populate UI
392:58 - that's it that's all we did we grabbed
393:00 - the ID from the top page we grab for you
393:04 - we use that to grab uh the data from
393:07 - database and then we populated you the
393:10 - UI that's all we did inside here
393:13 - honestly that's it beautiful that is all
393:16 - good guys are you still with me guys how
393:19 - cool is this you guys still with me
393:20 - that's pretty awesome huh you know who
393:22 - with me yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
393:24 - beautiful beautiful beautiful
393:26 - all right next one
393:29 - let's go take a look at how this
393:30 - actually works let's go back to our home
393:32 - page
393:34 - let's go back to our homepage
393:38 - I actually want to link the homepage to
393:39 - actually go back home because I'm
393:41 - getting tired of typing home I'll do
393:44 - Incredibles
393:46 - oh can I have the background image of
393:48 - undefined let me go back to here let's
393:50 - try this here again
393:53 - oh interesting let's go to here
393:58 - I think I know this is happening
393:59 - actually
394:00 - I know what's going on
394:02 - oh okay I got it so here's what needs to
394:06 - happen here
394:07 - um in order to for this to fully fully
394:10 - work right again this use effect happens
394:12 - maybe a little bit later on of course
394:14 - right so basically it initially we don't
394:18 - actually have this data at first right
394:20 - this happens later on this is why we
394:23 - need to do a little bit a little bit
394:25 - differently and in the detail page
394:27 - foreign
394:30 - [Music]
394:41 - image
394:49 - so here's a lot of times what I'll do
394:51 - for example the reason why it's yelling
394:53 - me is because the fact that we don't
394:54 - have the movie our disposal right now
394:56 - right we're trying to grip the movie
394:58 - back on image but whenever we go grab it
395:00 - from the database we're not actually
395:02 - getting it we're getting it a few
395:04 - seconds later that's kind of the issue
395:06 - there right so let me go ahead and look
395:08 - at this here for a second
395:10 - right there so we're still grabbing
395:12 - these that's no problem right I think
395:15 - the problem comes when we go ahead and
395:17 - go the specific movie so let me go and
395:19 - click this again
395:22 - that's okay all right to fix that here's
395:26 - what I usually do which is very simple
395:27 - fix I just do like this I say if movie
395:30 - exists
395:32 - like this
395:33 - if movie then we say uh
395:38 - uh no no and end right there right there
395:41 - eighth movie exists only then do we get
395:44 - all this data look at this
395:47 - oh come on come on holy Molina's
395:51 - holy macaroni okay my next only the
395:55 - movie exists do we actually show it in
395:57 - the database or show it on the front
396:01 - right there
396:03 - oh do you like this Papa
396:05 - don't worry don't worry guys it's gonna
396:07 - be fixed
396:09 - okay save that
396:12 - oh come on
396:13 - give me a break
396:21 - okay save that
396:25 - um must be wrapped in in closing tag you
396:28 - want to do this I did want a GSX
396:30 - fragment yes I did
396:32 - but
396:34 - oh I think I know why
396:36 - [Music]
396:40 - okay here let's do it like this
396:45 - and then this will be the closing tag
396:46 - right here
396:50 - we go
396:51 - fixed
396:55 - there you go and I'll show you exactly
396:56 - why this happened and what's going on
396:58 - and why we need to do this
397:01 - check this out
397:03 - okay good save that
397:06 - okay let's look at one
397:09 - oh look at that
397:12 - boom
397:15 - right there look at that
397:19 - boom
397:21 - boom
397:22 - boom oh let's go let's go let's go we
397:26 - fixed it guys we fixed this issue look
397:28 - at that that's awesome
397:31 - oh
397:32 - boom let's see we fixed the issue so
397:35 - what happened here guys very simple
397:36 - right well initially we got this errors
397:39 - because we tried to grab the background
397:41 - image for a movie that does not exist
397:43 - it's as simple as that right
397:45 - um does not exist because use effect it
397:49 - takes us a few seconds to actually grab
397:50 - the data from a database right so it
397:52 - takes a few seconds maybe like five
397:54 - seconds but to go to the actual page it
397:56 - takes a little millisecond right
397:58 - and so when we actually are executing
398:01 - this while this is trying to get the
398:03 - data right here right this is already
398:05 - being pre-loaded
398:07 - and is trying to do move the background
398:09 - image which is not right because we
398:11 - don't have it yet unfortunately
398:13 - we don't have it so we're not going to
398:15 - do this will give us an error but what
398:19 - we did here is very simple we said if
398:22 - the movie Object exists basically if
398:24 - it's this way he is not null right if
398:26 - the movie Object exists right then we
398:29 - will go ahead and execute and actually
398:30 - all put all this to your jsx in place
398:33 - right and then we got all these errors
398:36 - because why because we need to put this
398:39 - into this is called like an um an empty
398:42 - like tag an empty tag I forgot what it's
398:44 - called Anonymous tag Anonymous tag so
398:46 - it's not actually a deal but it's kind
398:47 - of like a div right when you put it
398:50 - inside here you have to wrap it inside
398:52 - of one container and anything else can
398:54 - go inside it it's a little bit confusing
398:56 - on on the react side
398:58 - but it's just some things like that they
398:59 - have to get used to unfortunately with
399:00 - react so uh yeah I know unfortunately
399:03 - that's just how the case it is you know
399:05 - but with it look
399:07 - we said the movies we say the data we
399:09 - got it if I go back to the home page
399:11 - boom right there oh oh so good oh
399:16 - oh so good look at that boom boom boom
399:20 - boom boom
399:22 - boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
399:25 - boom boom boom done guys how cool is
399:27 - this you guys still with me yes or no
399:29 - let's go yes you guys you are beautiful
399:32 - as always love you all very much now was
399:36 - that was that understandable did you
399:37 - guys understand why we had all these
399:39 - issues do you guys get that yes yes or
399:43 - no give me a thumbs up for yes give me a
399:44 - thumbs up for no
399:46 - okay all right in the comments as well
399:50 - guys on YouTube as well too
399:52 - all right
399:53 - all right so we got that portion that's
399:56 - working now all fine no problem
399:57 - whatsoever let's now focus on the last
400:01 - part of our application which is going
400:03 - to be the login section this might be a
400:05 - little bit harder but I'm sure we'll be
400:08 - able to figure it out okay
400:10 - this is where now we have to use Redux
400:12 - yet again okay we need to create a user
400:16 - kind of State Management to be able to
400:17 - manage the user State and see if the
400:19 - user exists right if these exist we do
400:23 - this if it does not exist we do that
400:25 - right that's it
400:27 - okay let's go ahead and create a movie
400:29 - slice uh let's go ahead and create a
400:30 - user slice actually so a new folder
400:32 - inside features new folder let's call
400:34 - call it user done right inside here
400:37 - we'll go ahead and do my bad we'll do
400:40 - user slice so new file
400:43 - new file user slice.js
400:46 - done okay
400:48 - same thing here let's go ahead and
400:49 - import Redux just how we did it inside
400:51 - the movie slice
400:53 - and by the way just a quick note the
400:55 - reason why it's called a slice is it's
400:56 - kind of like a slice of a pizza right if
400:58 - we're creating all these reducer
401:00 - functionalities which are just slices of
401:02 - the big thing that's why it's called a
401:04 - slice yeah nothing complicated there
401:07 - mm-hmm and pour slice
401:10 - nice
401:12 - then create initial state so const
401:14 - initial state
401:17 - initial state
401:19 - all right and there are three things
401:21 - we're going to say first one is going to
401:23 - be named
401:24 - right
401:26 - okay and this is going to be empty and
401:28 - then we're going to save email
401:31 - right also nothing and then we're going
401:34 - to say photo
401:36 - right that's the photo of the person
401:39 - foreign
401:41 - once we got that let's go ahead and
401:43 - create a slice so we'll say const user
401:46 - slice
401:47 - slice is equal to create slice
401:51 - create slicer
401:52 - create slice okay all right inside the
401:57 - crate slice
401:59 - give it some values like name
402:02 - in our case it can be user cool and then
402:06 - we will go ahead and give it the initial
402:08 - state right so our initial state is
402:10 - basically nothing nada
402:16 - then we have reducers this is where we
402:19 - will get our reducers and a few things
402:21 - we need to do on here inside the
402:23 - reducers
402:24 - um few juices the first we need to
402:26 - create is called set user so site user
402:29 - login
402:30 - so we'll call it set user login
402:35 - and this will of course take state
402:40 - comma what action
402:43 - right Papa
402:46 - there we go the second one is going to
402:49 - be which one which is going to be set
402:50 - sign out so set sign out
402:54 - because again when we sign out we want
402:56 - to be able to clear the state correct so
402:58 - we want to be able to clear everything
402:59 - here so it says sign out
403:03 - right there we'll say state
403:06 - okay no actually we're going to pass
403:08 - into here because nothing really happens
403:09 - and when we set to now what happens what
403:12 - do you think in the comments below what
403:13 - happens when we set sign out it's very
403:15 - simple we say state
403:16 - dot name
403:19 - is equal to basically nothing again or
403:21 - no
403:23 - okay
403:24 - we say state
403:27 - dot email
403:31 - is equal to null as well
403:34 - oh
403:35 - no
403:37 - boom and then we say State a photo that
403:40 - what photo is equal to what null 2 right
403:44 - beautiful now when we log in of course
403:47 - let's go and finish this one up again
403:49 - state.name is equal to what we're going
403:52 - to pass a some kind of action we'll say
403:54 - action dot payload
403:56 - payload dot name
403:59 - right there all right and then same
404:01 - thing is gonna happen with these other
404:03 - ones are here so there bomb in this case
404:06 - email
404:09 - and it will say payload.email
404:14 - right and then State DOT photo
404:18 - payload.photo
404:21 - all right no that's not the one save
404:24 - that
404:26 - beautiful okay so few things again set
404:30 - user login
404:31 - to be able to log the user in we save
404:33 - the user data okay then we set user sign
404:36 - out so we should be able to sign the
404:38 - user out so that we don't have the data
404:39 - anymore and basically we can't show that
404:42 - application anymore that's it all right
404:44 - give me one second I need to go ahead
404:45 - and take a breath
404:50 - so good so good
404:52 - okay
404:53 - okay after we've done that we need to
404:55 - grab all the actions right
404:58 - so we'll say here what
405:00 - I'll do it like this so it's a little
405:01 - bit cleaner okay so again we need to
405:04 - export the actions because actions will
405:06 - allow us to dispatch them right so we'll
405:10 - do what set user login and then set sign
405:13 - out so here we'll say
405:16 - right there oh no that's not what I want
405:18 - come on
405:19 - nope
405:23 - said user login comma set sign out is
405:30 - equal to what is equal to user slice
405:33 - user slice dot What DOT actions
405:38 - actions right there beautiful actions
405:42 - not action what actions are there
405:45 - actions make sure measure is plural all
405:48 - right after that
405:50 - okay we will go ahead and bring back the
405:53 - specific data so we'll say export
405:57 - right const
405:59 - and then this will be select
406:02 - select
406:03 - it's like what select user username
406:09 - user
406:11 - um also user name
406:13 - is equal to what
406:18 - State uh
406:20 - Papa
406:22 - state
406:26 - the
406:28 - user.wat.name right same thing is going
406:31 - to happen with these other ones
406:34 - but in our case we're going to do select
406:36 - user what user what do you think guys
406:38 - here user email here
406:41 - right because we need to select the
406:42 - email and we're going to grab the email
406:44 - from here
406:45 - boom and select user watch to a photo
406:49 - right there
406:50 - and that's going to grab the user photo
406:54 - done all right and then at this point
406:56 - all we need to do is export the reducer
406:58 - so we'll say export
407:01 - export uh default so by default we
407:04 - export the reducer default default user
407:08 - slice
407:09 - dot reducer
407:12 - Danza okay all right and that's it we've
407:15 - created our react Redux slice for just
407:18 - the user okay
407:20 - now let's tell the story that we have
407:23 - them so let's go to the store.js let's
407:24 - import it let's go ahead and remove this
407:26 - counter reduce because it's not useful
407:27 - at all
407:28 - oh
407:33 - there we go move this kind of reducer on
407:37 - unnecessary fully and let's do import
407:40 - user
407:42 - reducer
407:45 - from
407:47 - okay the features
407:50 - Dash what user dashboard user slice done
407:54 - okay and the same thing is going to
407:56 - happen here so say comma and then we'll
407:58 - give it a
407:59 - comma we'll say user here
408:02 - user user slice
408:05 - done all right so we were able to pass
408:07 - in all that data
408:09 - and now if we look at it here really no
408:12 - big area that's going on here we're
408:13 - pretty much all good on that aspect
408:15 - that's not what I want a view sort of
408:18 - you inspect element let's see yeah
408:20 - nothing crazy in terms of like actual
408:22 - errors are going on here nope we're good
408:23 - beautiful that makes me so happy okay of
408:26 - course if I go to here it should be all
408:28 - good as well
408:29 - okay so sweet sweet so so now in order
408:32 - to fully make this word we need to go
408:35 - let's think about how this works right
408:37 - we need to create a login button if
408:40 - we're not logged in right so let's think
408:42 - about this this will happen inside the
408:43 - header because remember if I go back to
408:45 - our app which is this app right here
408:47 - right
408:49 - let's go sign out you see the header
408:51 - changes right we have a login button
408:53 - right here
408:54 - right this right here and we need to be
408:57 - able to handle that so let's create the
408:58 - login button
409:00 - boom let's create the login button and
409:03 - that's going to happen inside the header
409:05 - header.js boom right there okay
409:08 - all right let's see
409:10 - so what's going to happen we need to be
409:12 - able to grab the username the email
409:14 - photo and see if it exists if the user
409:18 - does not exist we show the login button
409:20 - however if it does exist we don't show
409:23 - the login button and instead we show the
409:25 - user Circle does that make sense
409:26 - comprende oh good yes yes yes yes yes
409:28 - comprending good all right all right
409:31 - let's make that happen in that case by
409:33 - the way let me see here
409:35 - all right beautiful wow so many comments
409:37 - are going holy moly you guys insane all
409:40 - right beautiful
409:43 - all right so log in let's go ahead and
409:46 - create the login button in that case but
409:48 - first we need to of course need to
409:49 - import the select username all this kind
409:51 - of stuff so we can do that by doing like
409:53 - this import
409:56 - right here import select
409:59 - select user
410:01 - name comma select
410:05 - so that user what user photo
410:10 - comma what select
410:12 - ah user photo do anything else username
410:15 - and user photo we don't need their email
410:16 - that's pretty much it okay
410:19 - okay from what from no that's not what I
410:22 - want from
410:26 - from the actual user slide so from
410:29 - the features
410:31 - features
410:33 - comma or slash user
410:36 - slash
410:38 - user slice okay save that next thing of
410:41 - course we need to go ahead and import
410:43 - the the whole use selector thing so
410:45 - let's go ahead and do import
410:49 - watch
410:53 - use selector
410:55 - oh that's not what I want no use
410:57 - selector
410:59 - from what from oh my I forgot to show
411:03 - you guys my bad my bad my bad on YouTube
411:06 - how long was I on here I'm very curious
411:08 - hmm well here's what we did guys I said
411:11 - I went to here uh all I did is I
411:13 - imported this right here so like
411:14 - username is like user select user photo
411:16 - okay that's all pretty much did on
411:17 - YouTube Just so you guys know okay and
411:19 - then on the user slice I mean we did
411:21 - this whole user slide so hopefully you
411:22 - guys seen this I don't remember when did
411:24 - I put it on here hopefully you guys seen
411:25 - that one
411:27 - that's the one we did create okay let's
411:30 - now go back to
411:33 - I don't think it was that long huh I
411:36 - don't think it was that long it was not
411:38 - no okay thank you just to use selector
411:41 - okay let's go back to Heritage yes
411:47 - from and we need to import that from
411:51 - react Redux
411:53 - Yak Dash Redux
411:55 - three ducks
411:58 - react Dash Redux
412:01 - and honestly that's pretty much it redis
412:04 - Redux we've imported that that's all we
412:05 - now need at this point okay
412:09 - let me see make sure it's all good here
412:11 - react with us you selector import that
412:13 - uh let's actually now use that right so
412:15 - we use selector let's go ahead and use
412:17 - that so we're going to grab the username
412:19 - so const
412:21 - user
412:23 - name is equal to use selector
412:28 - you selector and which one you're going
412:31 - to use well select username right here
412:32 - so select
412:34 - select
412:36 - user name right there beautiful and then
412:40 - something const user photo
412:43 - is equal to use selector
412:46 - no
412:48 - um
412:48 - [Music]
412:49 - yeah so maybe on line eight
412:53 - yeah thank you Jesse
412:55 - you a selector
412:57 - awesome
412:59 - okay
413:00 - what do you select
413:02 - user photo
413:05 - beautiful so I'll use your photo it's
413:06 - exactly what we need and now at this
413:09 - point a few things are going to happen
413:11 - so here's let's think about this
413:14 - if we don't have if we don't have
413:17 - basically like the you know the yeah if
413:21 - we don't have the user basically then we
413:24 - you know login button and we can do that
413:27 - inside the nav menu so after the logo
413:30 - let's think about like this I'm going to
413:32 - create an if else statement
413:35 - so basically if there is no username
413:39 - user name oh
413:42 - this one if there is no username right
413:46 - if it does not exist
413:49 - then we will go ahead and show the login
413:52 - button so I'm going to say login
413:55 - that's it right log in
413:58 - right here and I'm gonna say login right
414:00 - this could be that's going to be a stock
414:01 - upon that we'll create otherwise
414:03 - otherwise
414:07 - otherwise
414:09 - we'll show the nav menu
414:11 - oh
414:13 - this one and the user image actually I
414:16 - feel like those two things are important
414:19 - okay otherwise we'll show the user menu
414:22 - and the login so to make that happen we
414:24 - need to make it again we need to use
414:26 - this call Anonymous tag like this
414:31 - right
414:35 - boom
414:37 - right so we need to put in the user
414:39 - image
414:41 - right there and then the menu inside
414:43 - there
414:48 - Papa
414:49 - Papa so we had another menu in here user
414:52 - image in here of course right
414:54 - uh to make it fully work of course we
414:57 - can do that so we have to do like this
414:59 - we have to do
415:01 - parentheses
415:03 - close parentheses
415:04 - right there Then over by the Seas oh
415:07 -  hold on that's not right it's not
415:08 - right question mark so again if this is
415:12 - true we do this otherwise we do this
415:16 - whole thing
415:17 - understand
415:18 - that's all happens that's it okay so now
415:21 - let's go ahead and try this out I'm
415:22 - Gonna Save this let's go to our app it
415:24 - says login is not defined exactly
415:27 - perfect it's exactly what we need to do
415:28 - so let's go to our login button so we'll
415:31 - say const
415:32 - login
415:34 - is equal to basically a const uh login
415:39 - is equal to style dash dash we'll make
415:44 - it a uh
415:46 - I want to say it let's just say a deal
415:48 - for now
415:49 - okay
415:51 - I do okay
415:54 - I did this option button right there you
415:56 - see Perfect all right all right so at
416:00 - this point to make this fully work what
416:02 - we'll do is the following so let's go
416:04 - ahead and do that
416:05 - um login button will do
416:08 - we'll give it a border radius let's
416:11 - think about this
416:12 - where's our login button oh it has like
416:14 - a border
416:15 - so let's give it a border initially
416:17 - so we have border one pixel solid
416:21 - let's level like this 41 pixel solid
416:24 - good
416:26 - let's think about this
416:27 - put it here
416:29 - border one pixel solid beautiful
416:31 - all right
416:33 - and then within that we're going to uh
416:35 - let's see border then it's going to give
416:37 - us some padding so padding
416:40 - 8 pixels
416:42 - right 16 pixels so 16 pixels on the left
416:46 - and right hand side save that beautiful
416:48 - now it's a little bit bigger bigger
416:50 - button which exactly what I like all
416:51 - right right so we stretch it out let's
416:53 - give it a border radius now
416:55 - border Dash radius
416:58 - radius right here okay
417:01 - radius beautiful I that's going to be
417:04 - border radius of 4 pixels
417:08 - four pixels I like that uh so much
417:10 - better all right we're going to go ahead
417:12 - and let's go ahead and do letter spaces
417:14 - so maybe face the ladder spacing a
417:16 - little bit
417:17 - spacing
417:19 - right 1.5 pixels
417:22 - okay just make it a little bit bigger
417:24 - and let's do tax transform uppercase
417:28 - to make sure it's all applicated text
417:29 - transform
417:32 - transform right here right there
417:34 - uppercase bro good
417:37 - all right beautiful nice nice nice nice
417:39 - then we just need to give it a
417:41 - background color so let's give it a
417:43 - background color a little bit more of a
417:44 - darker side but a transparent background
417:46 - color so let's try that right here
417:50 - voila okay so it's a little dark darker
417:54 - background color okay awesome next thing
417:56 - on the hover of this button of this div
417:58 - right so let's do the hover so we'll say
418:01 - hover right here so now however what are
418:04 - we going to do well let's think about
418:05 - this right on the hover we're changing
418:07 - kind of like number one to White so
418:10 - we're kind of flipping the black to
418:11 - white white to black right so let's try
418:13 - that right now
418:15 - okay hover
418:17 - let's change the background color
418:19 - background
418:21 - color
418:23 - it's going to be more of a wider color
418:25 - so it's going to a little bit like this
418:28 - awesome and then the color of the actual
418:31 - text is going to be now black so let's
418:33 - see
418:34 - black okay all right and then border
418:38 - color is gonna be transparent as well so
418:40 - border color
418:42 - Porter Dash color
418:44 - it'll be transparent
418:47 - parent uh rent be transparent
418:51 - there we go so let's go hover go ahead
418:53 - and hover this oh let's go beautiful but
418:57 - we're not done yet because let's give it
418:58 - a small transition so we'll do a
419:00 - transition here
419:02 - transition all 0.2 seconds right here no
419:06 - oh let's go beautiful let's also get a
419:10 - cursor pointer
419:12 - cursor
419:13 - pointer nice
419:16 - ah oh look at that beautiful that's what
419:20 - I'm talking about now of course so we
419:21 - have to log in now how do we make sure
419:23 - that this login is kind of all the way
419:25 - on the left slash the right hand side
419:27 - that's actually a good question how do
419:29 - we make sure we do that how do we make
419:30 - sure that the login is all the way on
419:32 - the lot on the left and the right hand
419:34 - side what do you guys think because if
419:36 - you think about this right the login is
419:37 - here right
419:39 - I hit the logo here right is there
419:41 - anything we can do for example with I
419:43 - don't know uh with the nav what should
419:47 - we do
419:48 - what do you guys think we can do well
419:49 - here's my thoughts on this I think we
419:51 - should create a logging container here
419:54 - a container here login container
419:58 - right here like this
420:00 - here's why I can put the lock inside
420:02 - here no problem whatsoever
420:04 - right
420:05 - but the login container look look what
420:08 - I'll do is I will go ahead and actually
420:11 - basically give it a flex of one that's a
420:13 - cool part I as well do all right that's
420:15 - going to create a long container
420:16 - underneath this one so we'll say Okay
420:19 - const login container style.div
420:23 - okay
420:24 - check out this Flex one
420:27 - Flex one
420:30 - right no look I know I know I know don't
420:32 - worry don't worry about this so here's
420:33 - what we'll do right it stretched out the
420:35 - whole div that's okay so here's what
420:37 - we'll do Now display Flex
420:41 - okay you see and then we'll do what
420:43 - justify content
420:45 - check this out justify content Center or
420:47 - flux sent justify
420:50 - justify content
420:53 - what flex and
420:58 - boom right there you see login now
421:00 - shifts right to the right hand side
421:02 - which is exactly what we need which is
421:03 - right here right there see just just I'm
421:07 - too good I'm too good
421:11 - so there we go we got we got that
421:14 - portion right there sorry
421:17 - [Music]
421:19 - that's how fun you know
421:22 - I was proud of that that's pretty cool I
421:24 - did not fly you know
421:26 - so
421:27 - okay so the login button is right there
421:29 - okay now what needs to happen is we need
421:32 - to go ahead on the click of this button
421:33 - we need to log ourselves in right now
421:36 - how does that work out well this is gets
421:38 - a little bit more tough for guys all
421:40 - right so let's try let's try this let's
421:42 - go ahead and create a sign-in function
421:44 - so we'll do const
421:46 - sign in
421:48 - sign in right here is equal to a
421:50 - function
421:51 - right and this is where Firebase really
421:55 - it plays a big role here okay on the
421:58 - sign in function
421:59 - uh well we need to input off here so
422:02 - let's go ahead and do that so this is
422:03 - where really we're going to use a lot of
422:06 - you know what is this react find render
422:08 - compatibility type I don't need that
422:10 - right here all right so let's go and
422:11 - import import
422:13 - we're going to use auth so import auth
422:19 - comma provider
422:23 - Provider from Firebase right
422:27 - from what
422:29 - Firebase right there boom okay
422:35 - okay import that from the from Firebase
422:38 - okay
422:39 - now when we sign in the way it works is
422:41 - very simple I click on something
422:43 - and I will call a function that will
422:45 - sign me in basically so to make that
422:47 - happen I will say here auth
422:50 - DOT sign in with pop-up
422:54 - sign in uh I'll do cleanly sign in
422:59 - with no with well this is what right
423:03 - there it's only with pop-up and the
423:06 - pop-up so basically it's going to pop up
423:07 - something what provider right well we
423:10 - said in Firebase we're going to use the
423:12 - Google provider so we'll say provider
423:14 - here
423:16 - provider beautiful and then that then so
423:20 - when we sign ourselves in and it's
423:22 - successful we say we get the result and
423:24 - what result do we get well let's take a
423:26 - look at what we get here back
423:30 - okay we get results and we actually
423:32 - let's go into console log the result for
423:34 - now console.log
423:36 - the log
423:37 - result
423:41 - okay boom save that console log result
423:43 - and of course we need to make that
423:45 - happen when you do unclick on here so on
423:47 - click
423:49 - unclick is equal to what and will give
423:52 - the function the sign in function so
423:54 - sign in
423:56 - sign
423:57 - in
423:59 - sign I function okay so let's try that
424:01 - now so we have that portion done let's
424:03 - click login
424:05 - oh oh would you look at that
424:08 - how cool is that oh guys holy moly right
424:11 - you click login pops up a button click
424:14 - contact level programmer right and let's
424:16 - see what we get back
424:18 - inspect them on this one
424:20 - what do we get back here let's go to
424:22 - console uh blah we get an object
424:24 - actually here look at this
424:26 - and this object has a user object let me
424:30 - show you so you guys can see it better
424:32 - right there we have a user object right
424:34 - here right there see and the user object
424:36 - has a lot of stuff including some IDs
424:38 - but the coolest thing it has is right
424:40 - here display name email
424:44 - and there's a photo one here too photo
424:46 - URL you see so we can actually use that
424:49 - fully we can fully use that to grab that
424:52 - data
424:53 - let's try it
424:55 - okay let's try it okay let's go back to
424:57 - here
424:59 - okay let's go back to here all right we
425:01 - have the specific portion all right so
425:04 - now let's go ahead and actually set the
425:07 - user data so we'll do of course
425:08 - console.log.user
425:10 - so the log uh user but a few things we
425:14 - need to do because on the log no user is
425:17 - fine
425:18 - this is where you set the data in the
425:19 - Redux to set the data in the Redux to
425:22 - set all this username and folder and
425:23 - stuff like that of course we need to
425:25 - grab this from the user slice right here
425:27 - right
425:28 - because we need to grab the what the set
425:30 - user login so let's grab that right now
425:32 - set user login let's go and grab that go
425:35 - back to overhead.js
425:37 - let's grab that from the user slice
425:40 - boom right there okay okay and then
425:43 - let's go ahead and you need to dispatch
425:44 - it as well so let's go ahead and
425:46 - dispatch it too so that means we need to
425:47 - import this patch that means we need to
425:51 - import use
425:53 - right here use dispatch
425:57 - use dispatch comma with use selector as
425:59 - well and we do use the dispatch so const
426:02 - dispatch is equal to what use dispatch
426:05 - use dispatch
426:08 - okay
426:10 - use this patch and then after that once
426:13 - we've once we imported dispatch let's
426:15 - actually dispatch it so here we'll do
426:17 - dispatch right there right dispatch what
426:20 - well what we dispatched the set user
426:24 - login
426:25 - set what user login with what data what
426:29 - data right so when you dispatch so you
426:31 - should log in with some data but what
426:33 - data we're going to actually give it
426:34 - well that's going to be up to us to
426:37 - figure it out right let's do that right
426:38 - now
426:40 - we have name
426:43 - is equal to what
426:46 - let's do this right here say let user is
426:48 - equal to result.user right
426:52 - remember we got that from where
426:54 - from here you see
426:56 - right there right there so user
426:59 - result.user is this right here
427:01 - specifically boom okay so now we'll do
427:04 - set user login okay and we say it's
427:07 - gonna be name is equal to user dot
427:09 - display name boom again coming directly
427:13 - from the data here display name right
427:16 - here you see next up email
427:19 - okay
427:21 - user.what user dot mail okay next up is
427:25 - going to be photo so photo
427:28 - okay user dot what photo URL which is
427:32 - coming directly from where from here
427:36 - right there fold the URL right there so
427:38 - you see there's a reason for everything
427:40 - that we're doing okay
427:42 - boom so now if I sign in if I click sign
427:45 - in again technically I should have the
427:48 - nav menu appear in here technically okay
427:52 - let's go ahead and try that out so let's
427:55 - go ahead and see sign in all right so I
427:58 - should really kind of like so it's gonna
428:00 - happen is it still going to dispatch the
428:02 - user login that's going to save it
428:05 - inside the global State want to save in
428:08 - a global state that means this will be
428:10 - right here updated automatically and
428:13 - once this is updated you see this
428:15 - becomes what
428:17 - not truthy but falsy and so it's going
428:20 - to show us a nav menu that is it let's
428:22 - go and try this out okay all right let's
428:25 - go and click login
428:31 - oh did you guys pay attention to that
428:34 - did you guys pay attention to this look
428:36 - it just showed up oh let's go that's so
428:41 - good give me one of Applause everybody
428:42 - hurt anybody I might just applausing for
428:45 - myself that's fine too
428:49 - that's fine too yeah there you go right
428:52 - so we got that portion working that's
428:54 - okay it makes me really happy
428:57 - and honestly that is it
429:00 - that is it okay and
429:03 - once we have this let's go ahead and
429:07 - focus on the sign up feature so we need
429:08 - to be able to sign out as well right
429:10 - and the signal happens when I click on
429:12 - what when I click on this right here I
429:15 - click on this I should technically sign
429:16 - out
429:17 - all right let's go ahead and do that
429:20 - okay so create a sign off function so we
429:23 - have con sign in const
429:26 - sign out
429:27 - out is equal to right here
429:32 - right there it's also equals to a
429:33 - function
429:35 - all right
429:36 - and what's going to happen here is of
429:38 - course we'll remove we'll assign the
429:41 - user out and to do that we'll do auth
429:44 - DOT sign out like so
429:48 - right and once that's successful we'll
429:51 - say that then
429:55 - function well dispatch a functionality
429:58 - well dispatch and it will dispatch what
430:02 - well
430:03 - user slice
430:05 - dispatch set sign out right that's the
430:07 - functionality you need to use
430:09 - that means we need to import it
430:11 - set sign out okay save that
430:15 - beautiful
430:18 - all right
430:19 - that's all good set sign out
430:22 - so this patch set sign out functionality
430:26 - and honestly that is it my friends and
430:29 - one small thing we can do is once you
430:31 - sign out all we have to do at this point
430:33 - is just simply redirect you back to the
430:35 - login page so let's try that right now
430:36 - now to do that we need to use something
430:38 - called history
430:40 - so we'll use here import
430:44 - use history
430:46 - look use history this is part of reactor
430:49 - react router Dom
430:52 - history
430:53 - from
430:55 - react Dash router Dash Dom
430:58 - and the way you use this like this right
430:59 - I'm gonna say const history
431:05 - is equal to use history
431:08 - beautiful and all I do at this point is
431:11 - I say this history that push so
431:13 - basically after all is said and done I
431:16 - just do a history that push
431:18 - I would say my friends let me see where
431:20 - is there wizard where's it where's it
431:21 - where's the where's it right there here
431:22 - I do history history
431:24 - that push basically
431:27 - and I push to the the login page so
431:31 - we'll say login
431:33 - that's it
431:35 - login page so if I sign out now we need
431:37 - to of course we need to go ahead and
431:38 - click on sign now so let's go ahead and
431:39 - do on click on the user image so on the
431:42 - click of the user image we'll sign out
431:44 - the user so on click
431:47 - right there we're going to sign out the
431:50 - user foreign
431:56 - save this so we have sign in sign out
431:58 - that's all good okay let's try this now
432:01 - you guys ready for this are you guys
432:02 - ready for this all right boom
432:07 - sound you can run Applause yay
432:10 - yay I'm pausing myself again dang it
432:17 - okay
432:18 - so log in
432:21 - all right
432:22 - classic level programmer
432:26 - all right beautiful that's exactly what
432:29 - we just got right so okay now of course
432:31 - we we logged in no and what we can do is
432:35 - after you sign in right we can also
432:37 - after you sign in we can also dispatch
432:39 - you to a different page so let's go and
432:41 - do this so we'll say uh history.push now
432:44 - push what
432:45 - the push to where to the home page right
432:48 - that's it
432:50 - there we go so if I let's go ahead and
432:52 - sign out again
432:53 - okay I did that that's fine right let's
432:57 - do history that push to the home page
432:58 - which is this one log in
433:00 - because the clever programmer
433:05 - boom oh look at that you guys ah it's so
433:09 - awesome so look at that and then I click
433:11 - sign out again oh my God it's still good
433:15 - and then
433:18 - hey let's go so there is one issue here
433:21 - however and it's the fact that for
433:23 - example you see if I refresh this
433:24 - basically the user is gone that's that's
433:27 - the issue here and we can actually kind
433:29 - of fix that by by setting the user
433:31 - whenever we kind of like um
433:34 - on the Heather so the way to fix that is
433:36 - very simple and again the reason why
433:38 - this happened is because the state is
433:40 - gone the state is gone once I refresh
433:43 - the page the state is gone that's it
433:45 - sayonara bye bye baby that's it we're
433:48 - done right so
433:50 - to fix it we're going to use off on
433:53 - state changed right and we're going to
433:55 - use use effect with this one too so look
433:57 - at this we'll say use effect
434:00 - use effect right here
434:02 - I'm going to say auth
434:06 - auth on state changed so we'll say uh
434:09 - use effect
434:12 - use effect right there
434:15 - okay okay we'll say
434:19 - basically on the change of let me see
434:24 - when you first log into the page
434:27 - right here
434:29 - when you first log in we'll do the
434:31 - following we'll do auth
434:34 - auth dot on
434:38 - of State changed
434:40 - okay it could be async
434:43 - we're going to grab the user
434:45 - and basically it's gonna be really
434:46 - simple right all that happens here is
434:48 - the user exists right there right
434:50 - because here's the thing
434:52 - um a Firebase remembers the user in
434:54 - cookies in a cookie and so that's where
434:57 - we get this right here right it
434:58 - remembers the user in the cookie
435:01 - and so say if user
435:04 - user then we do what
435:07 - then we do again we do
435:12 - dispatch like the site user login again
435:17 - dispatch that user login again and then
435:19 - we do history dot push
435:22 - dot push
435:25 - dot push home page
435:27 - down there we go
435:29 - uh oh this is more important right there
435:33 - boom
435:34 - that's it
435:35 - there you go so you see let's think
435:37 - about if I refresh now you see
435:40 - you see the user is actually being set
435:42 - right there you see when I refresh the
435:44 - receiver here the users being set if I
435:46 - sign out I sign out I sign it back again
435:49 - classic color programmer
435:54 - let's go
435:56 - let's go to here
435:57 - oh look at that guys that my friends is
436:02 - pretty much it we have finished with
436:04 - more well all the functionality we
436:06 - wanted to get done in Disney plus clone
436:11 - you can my friends you can sign out you
436:14 - can sign in anything you can do pretty
436:15 - much so sign out
436:17 - login
436:18 - right because your clever programmer
436:21 - beautiful
436:22 - right there click on individual movie
436:25 - watch the movie
436:27 - go back oh god let's go
436:32 - yay
436:34 - [Applause]
436:38 - that's what I'm talking about we have
436:41 - one last thing to do that we're going to
436:42 - try right now is we're going to try and
436:44 - deploy it actually as well I think it's
436:47 - actually deployed it's deployed on our
436:49 - side if you want to go ahead and deploy
436:52 - it on your site if you want to try it
436:53 - out because on our side is actually
436:55 - deployed already so
436:56 - um if you want to deploy it it's not
436:58 - that hard if you undeploy it just go
437:00 - ahead and let me see let me show it to
437:02 - you on your side
437:04 - deploy it right do Firebase deploy
437:07 - deploy
437:09 - deploy

441:46 - building today the clubhouse clone all
441:50 - right now you're going to have a screen
441:52 - that's gonna welcome you like this so
441:54 - you go okay let's enter my username and
441:57 - get inside all right here you can put
441:59 - your phone number and hit next now it
442:02 - might send you a code you put that in
442:04 - okay it's dummy it doesn't actually send
442:06 - you a code and then you hit next well
442:08 - are you going to enable notifications to
442:11 - know when people are talking you know
442:13 - what I actually will so I'm going to hit
442:15 - allow boom enter the clubhouse clone
442:19 - we're done with the onboarding flow now
442:22 - we are on to the logged in user flow we
442:25 - have our header at the top with our
442:27 - header components that are going to be
442:28 - there no matter where we go and here is
442:31 - our app and we're seeing which users are
442:33 - talking with each other how many people
442:36 - are in the room how many people are
442:38 - actively talking right I can start a
442:41 - room I can hit social I can hit let's go
442:43 - and boom look at that a loader popped up
442:45 - and then the room started now I can see
442:47 - that there are two people in the room I
442:49 - can hit the mute button and actually
442:51 - mute I can unmute all right and if I
442:55 - wanted to I can just click leave quietly
442:58 - and leave out of there nobody even knows
443:00 - that I was there and notice that I'm
443:02 - actually using bottom sheet which is
443:04 - something I'm going to show you with the
443:05 - react that you can use when I click
443:07 - things change and I'm doing using the
443:10 - react hook for use state right State
443:13 - Management and I'll be able to switch
443:15 - between them and look the text at the
443:17 - bottom changes other things that are
443:19 - happening in this app is if I click the
443:21 - profile it takes me to the profile page
443:23 - and here rafikaze has zero followers 51
443:27 - following clever cozy right and how am I
443:30 - making all of this styling happen right
443:32 - here let's go back and let's go to the
443:34 - explore page and look at how beautiful
443:36 - this page looks and how are we making
443:39 - this page look as beautiful right so how
443:42 - do we have this component here I'm using
443:44 - using Aunt D for this which I'm going to
443:46 - show you guys in this video we have our
443:48 - subheader component at the top Explorer
443:50 - with that back button right there okay
443:52 - I'm also using fire um icon so like boom
443:56 - we got this one right there all right
443:58 - languages how am I making all these
444:01 - cards appear and it looks really
444:03 - beautiful and look it's dynamically
444:05 - doing this right so I have data in a
444:07 - Json file and it's looping through and
444:09 - showing all of them so how do you
444:10 - actually do that with components and
444:12 - react you're going to learn how to do
444:14 - that so this is the clubhouse clone that
444:17 - you're going to be building this is one
444:20 - of the most advanced front-end projects
444:23 - and one of the most creative ones that
444:26 - we have done on this channel I think
444:28 - it's gonna blow your mind and I think
444:30 - you're going to be blown away by all the
444:32 - Advanced react.js Techniques that you
444:35 - learn so heavy front end build I'm
444:38 - excited I'm ready to just jump in and
444:40 - get some get my hands dirty I hope
444:43 - you're ready and I hope you're excited
444:44 - it with that said let's just smash the
444:47 - like button okay and subscribe to the
444:50 - channel because it really helps spread
444:53 - this video out if all you do is smash
444:55 - the like button doesn't cost you
444:56 - anything but changes my freaking life
444:57 - okay puts a video in front of people and
445:00 - our goal at clever programmer and so 5
445:03 - 000 people get jobs this year okay so
445:06 - I'm really really excited about that I
445:08 - love your beautiful face and we're going
445:10 - to be getting in to the video now let's
445:13 - go all right so let's just get straight
445:15 - into the build so first things first
445:17 - open up your command line so I'm just
445:19 - going to open up my
445:21 - um I term for you it'll probably be just
445:23 - regular terminal okay and uh you can
445:25 - make this folder wherever you want but I
445:28 - just like to go into my GitHub I have a
445:30 - folder called Banger projects that's
445:31 - where I like to put all of this and then
445:33 - I'm just gonna do create react app or
445:36 - you can do npx create react app okay
445:38 - like this and I will do Clubhouse clone
445:42 - and hit enter so at this point we're
445:44 - just gonna wait for the installation to
445:47 - be done as soon as the installation of
445:50 - your project is done and it's
445:52 - initialized then you're ready to get
445:53 - started okay and they're going to be a
445:55 - couple of differences between what
445:57 - you're doing and what I'm doing maybe
445:58 - you use npm maybe I use yarn so wherever
446:01 - I use you see me using yarn okay I'm
446:03 - gonna be using yarn add you're going to
446:05 - be using npm install okay so don't let
446:07 - that freak you out as we get into it now
446:10 - I'm going to go into my Clubhouse clone
446:11 - folder and you'll see hey that folder
446:13 - exists and I'm inside of it and now what
446:16 - I want to do is I want to open up my
446:18 - visual studio code and I'm gonna hit oh
446:20 - I'm gonna go to GitHub
446:23 - um I have my Banger projects folder and
446:25 - inside here I got my Clubhouse clone and
446:28 - you can just go ahead and open up your
446:30 - new folder that you made I'm gonna go
446:32 - here app.js kit command J to open my up
446:35 - up my command line and then I'm just
446:37 - gonna do yarn start and on the right
446:40 - hand side you're gonna see my server
446:42 - open up and I'm Gonna Keep it running
446:43 - right right there okay so at this point
446:46 - you should be at this part where your
446:49 - little circle is spinning and now
446:51 - another thing I want to do is I'm gonna
446:53 - go ahead and add so whenever I do yarn
446:56 - add what you should do is you should do
446:58 - npm install like that okay so I'm gonna
447:01 - do yarn add I'm gonna add bootstrap to
447:04 - my project because we're gonna need it
447:06 - okay so let's go ahead and install that
447:09 - and once that's done installing you
447:11 - should be good to go as far as bootstrap
447:14 - is concerned okay and then we're gonna
447:16 - go to our index file index.js and
447:19 - actually right underneath here I'm gonna
447:22 - do import bootstrap dist CSS bootstrap
447:28 - mn.css okay just like that so this will
447:30 - allow us to actually import bootstrap
447:32 - because we're going to be needing it
447:34 - throughout this project and next up
447:36 - let's actually just reset all of the
447:39 - styling so that's another thing I like
447:40 - to do so let's go ahead and just remove
447:43 - our index CSS s file completely I'm also
447:46 - going to grab everything in my app.css
447:48 - and just remove it and hit save and then
447:51 - let's go to our index.js file and let's
447:54 - remove this line where we have index.css
447:57 - okay because we just removed that file
447:59 - so of course on the right hand side is
448:01 - giving us an error about that and
448:03 - complaining okay so let's go to app.js
448:06 - sometimes when you run into errors just
448:08 - hit refresh usually what's especially a
448:11 - lot of The Styling errors that you're
448:12 - going to run into it takes care of a lot
448:15 - of those now the last part of the reset
448:17 - is going to be let's go to our app.css
448:21 - and in our app.css let's just add some
448:24 - styling okay so let's go to my root here
448:28 - and how I'm going to style it is I'm
448:30 - just going to say text color again this
448:32 - is going to be the text that we're going
448:34 - to need for the clubhouse style color
448:38 - text okay let's give it this text here
448:40 - dope and then I'm going to do button
448:43 - background color okay so now we got our
448:46 - button background color as well let's
448:47 - hit refresh that should be good okay
448:49 - beautiful and let's now go ahead and uh
448:52 - give it our HTML a scroll behavior of
448:55 - smooth and then body I'm going to do
448:58 - margin zero so this is so I can remove
449:01 - any uh styling that react comes with so
449:05 - that's why I want to specifically say
449:07 - margin zero and just like remove any of
449:10 - those okay even though we removed index
449:11 - CSS but it's just good to go ahead and
449:13 - do that for resetting purposes font size
449:17 - one em and then font family we're going
449:20 - to do new triff Pro like that all right
449:24 - now let's actually work on adding the
449:26 - welcome page uh inside of our clubhouse
449:30 - clone alright so the welcome page that
449:32 - we're going to be working on is going to
449:34 - look like this okay so let's go ahead
449:36 - and work on that so first things first
449:40 - I'm going to go to my app.js and we're
449:43 - going to remove pretty much everything
449:45 - that I have in here okay and honestly
449:48 - just for now let's just leave it with
449:50 - like a dumb H2 and just say let's build
449:54 - the clubhouse clone okay just so there's
449:57 - something here and of course because we
450:00 - um let's also remove the logo and hit
450:03 - refresh cool and here we have let's
450:05 - build the clubhouse clone that's all you
450:07 - should have right now now we're gonna
450:08 - work on and add some of our components
450:11 - okay so let's go ahead and add our
450:15 - welcome.js so I'm gonna build a page so
450:18 - let's go in our source I'm going to
450:21 - create a new folder and it's going to be
450:22 - called Pages just like this and inside
450:25 - of pages I'm going to have a file and
450:28 - it's going to be called Welcome JS okay
450:30 - and we're going to do import react from
450:33 - react okay now let's we're gonna go
450:36 - ahead and Link this file in just a
450:38 - second so I'm going to say export
450:40 - default function welcome okay and then
450:44 - let's just have it return something
450:45 - silly for now like I'm gonna say stew I
450:49 - am speaking from the Welcome JS file
450:53 - okay I want to just Hannah potato symbol
450:56 - because why not so I'm already exporting
450:58 - this let's go ahead back to our app.js
451:00 - and Link this file now so I'm gonna go
451:02 - here and let me actually just try to do
451:06 - this
451:07 - let's see how intelligent it is Boom so
451:11 - you can see that my import automatically
451:13 - happened import welcome from Pages slash
451:16 - welcome and I I'm speaking from the
451:18 - Welcome JS file so now these files and
451:21 - components are linked and let's go ahead
451:23 - and keep adding things uh to our welcome
451:26 - component okay so let's start off from
451:31 - I'm gonna remove all of this just for
451:33 - now we're gonna hit return and then I
451:35 - want to do and create a div and let's go
451:39 - ahead and give this a class name of I'm
451:41 - gonna do Styles and do
451:45 - style this autocomplete is aggressive
451:47 - style.welcome container okay and now
451:51 - it's going to be complaining about hey
451:53 - style is not defined well no worries
451:55 - we're just gonna go ahead and make the
451:57 - Styles now so let's right click into our
452:00 - source file and I'm going to create a
452:02 - new folder this folder is going to be
452:05 - called style and this is going to create
452:07 - all our styling and in here I'll create
452:09 - a new file and it'll be called welcome
452:11 - welcome dot module.css just like this so
452:16 - this is our page and this is the styling
452:18 - that goes with that page okay so they're
452:20 - just gonna work hand in hand now inside
452:22 - of here let's just add some level of
452:25 - styling so I'm just going to say welcome
452:27 - container okay and let's just add
452:31 - padding of 3 Em by 1.5 am okay just like
452:35 - this so I'm going to leave this as is
452:37 - until we run into our next problem let's
452:40 - hit refresh now it will still complain
452:42 - that style is not defined well that's
452:44 - because you probably have to actually
452:46 - import it at the top so let's go import
452:48 - style from style welcome okay let's do
452:53 - it like that and we're gonna do welcome
452:55 - dot module dot CSS okay so now it should
453:01 - be good to go okay so now inside of this
453:03 - div we're gonna add a H1 and let's just
453:07 - have that H1 say welcome so now there
453:10 - you go we got our welcome and the reason
453:12 - why you have that padding is because we
453:14 - added a bunch of padding probably three
453:16 - em padding from the top and then 1.5 on
453:19 - the side so you get the welcome right
453:21 - here if I went back to our styling uh
453:24 - where did we have the style here right
453:26 - if we change this up it's going to do
453:29 - something different if I change that to
453:30 - 1.5 it's going to be different so here
453:34 - our styling is connected and it's
453:35 - working and that's a really good sign
453:37 - okay now we're gonna have um this one
453:41 - all of these okay so we're gonna create
453:43 - a new styling for this so let's go ahead
453:46 - and do that so right underneath my
453:48 - welcome I'm going to create another div
453:50 - I'm going to give it a class name of
453:53 - let's go with style dot welcome info all
453:59 - right and then welcome info I'm gonna
454:02 - have a paragraph tag and we're pretty
454:04 - much going to start off with the with
454:06 - just some copy and I'll just say hey
454:09 - we're working hard to get Clubhouse
454:11 - ready for everyone while we wrap up the
454:18 - finishing touches okay we're adding
454:22 - people gradually you don't have to copy
454:24 - all of that with me but I just like to
454:27 - add it because this actually makes it
454:28 - look like a real clone you know so like
454:31 - just going one step further to make it
454:34 - look very very real okay so that's why
454:36 - you know if you want to do it just do it
454:38 - with me because your project is going to
454:39 - look freaking phenomenal all right to
454:42 - make sure because sometimes what happens
454:43 - is if your project is just too dummy of
454:46 - a project recruiters are going to look
454:48 - at it and they're gonna be like looks
454:49 - too dummy but adding a little bit of
454:51 - this even though it seems like grunt
454:52 - work might add a wow factor to your
454:55 - project all right so that's why don't
454:57 - get lazy here just work with me all
454:59 - right and then I'm just gonna say noting
455:01 - making sure nothing breaks cool all
455:05 - right so that's uh good and let's see do
455:09 - I want to have all of this I can I'm
455:12 - going to be lazy and I'm just gonna copy
455:14 - it okay I'll give you a deployed version
455:16 - too and then you'll be able to copy it
455:18 - from there as well so we'll put another
455:21 - P tag here and I'll paste all of that
455:23 - cool and then do I have anything else
455:26 - okay the last it's the last finishing
455:29 - touches okay so let's go P tag oh whoa
455:32 - what happened there P tag let's paste it
455:35 - alright so our second P tag all the all
455:39 - these look good but I think one of them
455:41 - might need a little bit of styling work
455:43 - so we're going to go ahead and do that
455:46 - in a second but right now more
455:47 - importantly this is going to need some
455:49 - styling so let's go back to our
455:52 - module.css
455:54 - all of this is going to need styling so
455:56 - now let's style our container so I'm
455:58 - going to go display Flex that's going to
456:01 - enable Flex mode and look at how pretty
456:03 - it looks yeah we're done
456:05 - I'm gonna do Flex Direction and uh we'll
456:08 - start off with column okay back to
456:11 - normal back to where we started and then
456:13 - I'm going to justify content with space
456:15 - between cool and then let's do align
456:19 - items like start okay hi let's try 100
456:24 - VH
456:26 - so that gave it a nice little height
456:29 - from the top and then let's go ahead and
456:32 - add a background color and that's going
456:34 - to do magical stuff right that's going
456:37 - to give it that Clubhouse background
456:39 - color and it's going to start to look
456:40 - nice just like that pink
456:42 - all right so if I remove this background
456:44 - color looks regular looks white I added
456:47 - and now it looks like oh maybe a little
456:49 - clubhousey okay now what I want to do is
456:52 - now let's style the welcome containers
456:56 - H1 which is going to be that welcome
456:58 - okay so let's go welcome container H1 so
457:02 - I'm going to select that H1 and let's
457:03 - style that bad boy so fine font size I'm
457:05 - gonna go with the 1.7 em so let's make
457:09 - that a little bit smaller give it a font
457:11 - weight of 500 okay refresh cool font
457:15 - style I'm gonna go with normal and then
457:18 - margin bottom let's go zero cool and
457:23 - then color I'm just gonna use the
457:25 - variable of the color that I made for
457:27 - text color and then we'll be able to
457:29 - reference that dope okay and then let's
457:33 - style our welcome info class so welcome
457:37 - info height let's go with 253
457:42 - pixels okay and I'm gonna go over flow
457:47 - Auto
457:48 - dope
457:49 - so now you can see I have like this
457:51 - little scrolling thing so now it just
457:54 - doesn't keep just going down I can
457:56 - actually like scroll up and down there's
457:58 - another reason why you should add the
458:00 - dummy content right even though it seems
458:02 - like grunt work to add all this it's
458:04 - good because once you have it you'll
458:05 - have if you don't have all of this text
458:07 - and you won't even have that like
458:09 - scrolling functionality all right and
458:12 - then let's go and um style the paragraph
458:16 - tag so all of this stuff that's wrapped
458:18 - in paragraph tag so I'm going to go
458:20 - ahead and style that now so let's go
458:22 - margin bottom I'm gonna go to em on this
458:27 - thing cool and let's go color and again
458:31 - we're going to use the text color font
458:34 - size I'm gonna go with uh one em on this
458:37 - thing and let's see font style normal
458:41 - should be good okay and font weight 400.
458:45 - so again when sometimes uh some of this
458:48 - stuff doesn't work refresh and you'll
458:50 - see the difference so for example if I
458:52 - change this to like something ridiculous
458:55 - like 900 it'll it should show you okay
458:57 - so this is just to make sure that hey
458:59 - like things are things are working as
459:01 - expected all right so now what I want to
459:04 - do is I'm going to actually take all of
459:06 - this and I'm gonna I want to put it in
459:08 - like a parent container and then style
459:11 - that all right so we will call that
459:14 - component uh plan layout so let me go to
459:17 - app.js so I'm going to take this welcome
459:19 - component that I have and I'm going to
459:22 - wrap it in something called plan layout
459:24 - so it's going to look like this plan
459:26 - layout okay but since I haven't made it
459:30 - yet I'm gonna go and make that first so
459:33 - inside of pages I will create a new
459:35 - folder where you will call it layouts
459:38 - all right and inside of this folder I'll
459:41 - create a new file and we'll call it
459:43 - planned
459:45 - layout.js okay epic now in here let's do
459:49 - import react from react all right let's
459:53 - capitalize that R and then let's go
459:55 - function plan layout and it'll have
459:59 - children okay and I'm going to return
460:04 - this and what I'm going to return is a
460:07 - div and it's going to have a certain
460:09 - styling okay so we're going to use jsx
460:11 - here let's go like this I'm going to go
460:15 - with 100 I'll go Max with I'm gonna need
460:20 - to put a comma here it's an object jsx
460:23 - object okay that's what we're passing in
460:26 - here let's give it 500 pixels and then
460:30 - I'll give it margin Auto okay and then
460:35 - of course let's go to where the div is
460:37 - ending okay we'll end the div here and
460:40 - inside of this will put all the children
460:42 - components there alright so plan layout
460:45 - plus all the children components will go
460:47 - inside of it now let's make sure that we
460:50 - go ahead and Export this export default
460:52 - plan layout just like this and let's
460:56 - wrap this bad boy Lester have you been a
460:59 - bad boy
461:00 - inside of a plan layout all right so I'm
461:04 - gonna hit uh return like this
461:07 - plan layout wait why the does it
461:10 - say plan layout J oh there we go plan
461:15 - layout still says J whatever boom boom
461:18 - so wrapped it up just like this and I'm
461:21 - gonna do import plan layout from and
461:26 - again where is it at it's in pages and
461:30 - then inside of layouts and then inside
461:32 - of there it's a file called plan layout
461:34 - alright so I'm going to get it just like
461:37 - that Pages layouts plan layout hey look
461:41 - at that starting to look a lot more
461:44 - clubhousey okay great progress so far
461:48 - and now let's actually start adding
461:50 - links on this page so then we can
461:52 - navigate out of the home page right
461:53 - otherwise we're going to be permanently
461:55 - stuck in the home page and uh that's not
461:57 - what we want okay so we're gonna add uh
461:59 - links to be able to go to the next page
462:01 - now so let's do that so first things
462:03 - first now we're about to start adding
462:05 - routing okay so what that means when you
462:08 - want to do that is we need to install
462:10 - things so let's go yarn add again you're
462:13 - going to do npm install whenever you see
462:15 - me do that and we're going to do yarn
462:17 - add and let me move myself away a little
462:20 - bit here so you can see what I'm typing
462:21 - yarn add and we will do react Dash
462:26 - router just like that and hit enter
462:29 - okay and then the next one we're gonna
462:31 - do is um we're gonna install react
462:33 - router Dom and what this will allow us
462:36 - to do is it will allow us to navigate
462:38 - back and forth between pages okay so
462:42 - that's going to be an important thing so
462:44 - now both of them are installed just in
462:46 - case you missed it yarn add or npm
462:48 - installed this one and also install this
462:51 - one cool so now both of those should be
462:53 - added in your package Json and I mean
462:56 - I'll just show you my packet Json okay
462:59 - let's go my yarn lock they look very
463:01 - ugly I thought they're going to look
463:02 - much prettier but there it is react
463:04 - router react router Dom bootstrap that's
463:08 - what I have you should have those uh
463:10 - things as well cool so let's add them to
463:14 - my welcome.js page
463:17 - um so let's go to this page here hit
463:19 - save and let's start working on it so
463:22 - I'm going to do
463:23 - import link
463:26 - from react router Dom
463:29 - so in in react you don't want to use
463:31 - like a tag that much you want to use
463:34 - this link and what that allows you to do
463:36 - is navigate between Pages without having
463:38 - to do any type of refresh it's really
463:41 - really powerful
463:42 - so take uh take advantage of that so
463:45 - let's go down down down and I'll go
463:48 - right underneath here underneath the
463:51 - Paul whatever section because we want to
463:54 - add uh we want we want to add these
463:56 - buttons and things right there so let's
463:58 - go underneath this and I'm going to make
464:01 - a new div and this will have a class
464:04 - name of and we'll do style dot action
464:08 - button okay we're going to style this in
464:11 - a second but let's just add it for now
464:13 - just so you can see how ugly it looks
464:15 - and then you'll see the prettier version
464:17 - afterwards so I'm going to say link
464:19 - exact two and we'll do get username and
464:25 - after this we'll do class name equals
464:28 - primary button and this is coming from
464:32 - bootstrap align items Center
464:36 - and just like this okay and now it's
464:40 - complaining it's like hey you gotta like
464:42 - close some of this stuff so we will
464:43 - close it in just a second but we have to
464:46 - close our link first so once our link
464:49 - closes then it will be fine okay save
464:52 - refresh all right so now it's going to
464:55 - give us a little error and it's going to
464:56 - complain hey you're using link outside a
465:00 - router so let's go ahead and fix that
465:02 - right now so let's go at the top I'm
465:05 - going to hit import browser router and
465:09 - we'll do from react router Dom okay
465:13 - actually my bad let's do that in our
465:15 - let's do that actually in our app.js
465:18 - file okay let's do that here and let's
465:21 - wrap our entire app in the browser
465:23 - router so let's go browser router okay
465:26 - and save okay so now our entire app is
465:29 - wrapped up in it cool so now let's go
465:33 - here so our link now is good to go and
465:36 - we're gonna add a few things to it so
465:39 - let's go to all right so right
465:41 - underneath this let's go and go get your
465:46 - username actually let's get out of the
465:48 - link tag and I'm gonna do get your
465:51 - username and we'll just kind of like
465:53 - leave this blank for now let's hit save
465:56 - and here it is right we can already see
465:58 - that link it says get your username and
466:00 - you can see that right when I clicked it
466:02 - it actually navigated me to get
466:04 - underscore user that's really dope it
466:07 - happened like really fast and without
466:10 - even refreshing of course we'll need to
466:11 - tell it to how do you route out of this
466:13 - page and then how do you render a new
466:15 - page we'll have to tell it and teach it
466:17 - those things and let's add an image okay
466:20 - and this image we're gonna have a source
466:22 - and of course I'm gonna have you guys
466:25 - get access to all these images Okay so
466:28 - let's go and get this image alright so
466:31 - for now I'm going to hold off on this
466:33 - image we have our username so that's
466:35 - good let's just actually work with the
466:37 - button first and then if we need to add
466:38 - anything we will add it later let's go
466:41 - underneath this all right and I'm going
466:42 - to make another link okay so we have
466:46 - this button here being a link and then
466:48 - we'll add another little button thing
466:49 - and then that'll also be a link okay and
466:52 - then um actually this one just will just
466:54 - be text so I'm going to say have an
466:56 - invite text sign in cool just like we
467:00 - have over here have an invite text sign
467:02 - in cool I have an invite text sign in so
467:04 - we got two links here but now we need to
467:07 - do styling because one looks like a
467:08 - button and one looks like text they're
467:10 - also Center aligned so we need to make
467:12 - sure that we do that with ours okay we
467:14 - need to make sure that we Center align
467:16 - them so let's go ahead and do that all
467:18 - right so now inside let's go to our
467:21 - styling and style this okay so I'm gonna
467:24 - go to my welcome
467:26 - Dot module.css and let's actually style
467:30 - our action button so let's go here and
467:33 - I'm gonna go action button and let's go
467:35 - align self let's go Center cool so now
467:39 - both of those are centered that's a
467:41 - really good sign we will do display Flex
467:44 - okay so now they look nice and ugly but
467:47 - we're gonna fix them in just a second
467:49 - let's give it a direction of column good
467:54 - um we're gonna need to align them
467:56 - vertically as well cool and then of
467:58 - course let's align them horizontally as
468:01 - well with justify content content Center
468:05 - okay cool and now I'm going to take my
468:09 - let's grab our action button class again
468:12 - and let's grab our last child of um of
468:17 - our a okay so let's go grab that and for
468:21 - color I'm going to do button background
468:24 - color like this font size let's go with
468:28 - I really want to make um this clone
468:31 - Pixel Perfect so that's that font size
468:34 - looks good to me okay there we go again
468:37 - sometimes when I'm doing this guys it
468:39 - gives me AIDS I'm like what the is
468:40 - going on change the goddamn thing and
468:42 - finally when I hit refresh everything
468:45 - changes and it looks good okay so if if
468:47 - your styling is not doing anything just
468:50 - hit refresh okay so Watch What Happens
468:53 - right when I add this color right it
468:56 - gives it this uh what is that like a
468:57 - weird ugly turquoise color okay that's
469:00 - necessary because Clubhouse looks like
469:03 - that alright so give it that color it's
469:05 - gonna be good font size we got it
469:07 - working let's add a weight and I'm gonna
469:10 - go with the weight of 400 cool refresh
469:14 - okay good
469:16 - good all right and then font style let's
469:19 - go with normal on this thing
469:22 - Okay cool so so far this is looking good
469:26 - all right now we're gonna add the patch
469:28 - for having an invite page as well so
469:31 - what does the invite Page look like well
469:33 - if I go to the finished version of the
469:34 - app and I go to my invite page it looks
469:37 - like this okay and then if I like you
469:40 - know put in uh some random dummy number
469:43 - whatever it takes me another page and
469:45 - then that actually takes me to this page
469:46 - and when I click it it takes me to the
469:48 - app all right so we have a bunch of
469:50 - screens that we want to work on so we
469:52 - can have a actual normal looking user
469:54 - flow because that's something important
469:56 - as a developer you need to learn how to
469:58 - be able to design that and build it okay
470:00 - and make it functioning so let's go and
470:03 - add that now so first I'm gonna work on
470:06 - the phone confirmation page so we're
470:09 - going to work on the page where if I go
470:12 - here it asks me for this type of stuff
470:14 - okay so let's go and work on that I'm
470:17 - gonna go to pages and inside of pages
470:19 - we'll create a new page new file file
470:23 - and we're going to do page or actually
470:25 - phone
470:27 - confirmation.js just like this all right
470:30 - so now let's start off with importing
470:33 - react
470:34 - and we're going to need to use um we're
470:37 - going to need to do State Management so
470:38 - let's also use use State because we're
470:41 - going to need it and uh that's good cool
470:44 - let's also import Style
470:46 - okay and I'm gonna let's comment this
470:49 - out for a second because uh we're gonna
470:51 - need to create styling for this in just
470:53 - a second okay and let's also import link
470:57 - so it can allow us to navigate without
470:59 - needing to refresh so react router Dom
471:02 - beautiful and let's go and Export
471:05 - default function phone confirmation and
471:09 - what export default does is at the
471:11 - bottom of the screen you don't have to
471:12 - add a separate line for uh exporting
471:16 - this and it allows you to use this
471:18 - component phone confirmation inside of
471:20 - your other files wherever you might want
471:22 - to use it so we're going to have a value
471:26 - set value okay a state variable okay
471:30 - it's going to keep track so just start
471:32 - off with use State and then we're going
471:34 - to do a return div and class name style
471:38 - phone confirm phone confirm and let's go
471:43 - container we're going to work on that
471:45 - container in a second for now now let's
471:47 - just add in this enter your phone so can
471:52 - we see that page right now well let's
471:54 - try Okay so let's try to go to slash
471:57 - invite all right or get user we can't
472:00 - really go to that page so we're gonna
472:02 - need to add routing for it so we can go
472:04 - to it okay so let's do that first so I'm
472:06 - going to go to my app.js and then app.js
472:10 - let's add routing for it so I got my
472:12 - browser router and I'm also going to get
472:15 - route just like this and within my app
472:18 - underneath plan layout what I want to do
472:22 - is I'm going to go uh let's delete this
472:26 - line here okay this is going to be
472:28 - something cool I'm going to do so route
472:30 - exact path and I'll say the home page
472:34 - should take us to this component oh this
472:37 - is such clean syntax I think this is new
472:39 - with react this is a really really clean
472:41 - syntax all right and then we have slash
472:45 - invite and this should take us to the
472:47 - phone confirmation page okay and make
472:52 - sure that you import that at the top so
472:54 - now it says welcome is not defined and
472:57 - it goes so welcome let's do capital W so
473:00 - now that's good and now it says style is
473:03 - not defined in phone confirmation.js so
473:07 - let's go back to our file guys a lot of
473:10 - this you have to get used to and
473:12 - comfortable with reading the errors okay
473:14 - a lot of the battle is like actually
473:16 - understanding what your errors are
473:17 - saying it says his style is not defined
473:19 - and that actually makes sense it's like
473:21 - style and it's complaining so probably
473:23 - we have to actually import style so in
473:26 - our phone con confirmation let's go
473:28 - ahead and do import style from and we're
473:32 - gonna do style slash phone
473:35 - confirm.module.css but now we have
473:38 - another problem it says can't resolve
473:40 - meaning like now I can't find this file
473:42 - and that's because we didn't actually
473:43 - create this file yet okay while we're
473:46 - making our or phone confirmation
473:48 - component let's also create the styling
473:50 - for it so let's go to our style folder
473:54 - and in here we're going to create a new
473:56 - file and this new file is going to be
473:58 - called phone confirm Dot
474:01 - module.css and let's just start off with
474:04 - some styling actually it's running
474:06 - already so let's go back to our code for
474:09 - now so now all errors are gone that's a
474:12 - good sign and if I go to the slash
474:14 - invite page I can actually see where we
474:17 - have written enter your phone and it's
474:19 - showing that right over here so that's
474:21 - also a really good sign that means
474:23 - that's really cool it means our routing
474:25 - is working and this component is being
474:28 - rendered based on the routing so if I go
474:30 - to app.js we say Hey whenever you go to
474:33 - slash invite then show the phone
474:35 - confirmation component okay and let's go
474:37 - to that component it's really really
474:39 - clean okay let's hit save let's hit
474:41 - refresh where did I add those stupid
474:43 - little tildas so we have enter your
474:45 - phone where the heck did I Anthem I
474:47 - can't even see them pretty fresh
474:49 - delete holy crap let's undo
474:55 - okay well I guess you're just gonna have
474:57 - to live with them now
475:00 - um all right well that's it okay let's
475:02 - let's keep going all right so
475:05 - um what I want to do now is I want to
475:07 - style style this thing okay but I'm
475:10 - gonna style it in just a second I don't
475:12 - know man some weird happens when
475:14 - you're demoing stuff but at this point I
475:17 - just don't care guys and uh we just
475:19 - gotta roll with the punches all right so
475:21 - inside of this div I'm gonna create a
475:23 - new P tag and uh we're gonna say by
475:26 - entering your number you're agreeing to
475:31 - our terms okay so I'm just gonna leave
475:34 - it like this you're agreeing let's go
475:37 - agreeing okay and then I'll I'll add a
475:41 - Spam tag let's not end our P tag yet and
475:44 - within my span tag I'm just going to say
475:47 - terms of service and privacy
475:52 - policy okay and then I'll say tanks
475:56 - outside of the spam tag cool but let's
475:59 - maybe give it a space let's give that a
476:02 - space dope so this is looking good by
476:05 - the way I discovered I added it to my
476:07 - entire app so now again a debugging
476:09 - session okay so if I add it into my
476:11 - entire app and it's showing up
476:12 - everywhere then it's not component
476:15 - specific it is global so Global I
476:20 - shouldn't be looking within this
476:21 - component because the Eric can't
476:23 - possibly be here so I'm going to look
476:25 - inside of my app JS and inside of my
476:27 - app.js I have multiple components right
476:30 - and if you notice I've actually added it
476:32 - right there okay so now that's
476:35 - permanently there no matter what page
476:38 - I'm at okay so you you could if you
476:40 - added a potato here it would follow you
476:42 - to the depths of hell it doesn't matter
476:45 - where you go it will follow you
476:47 - throughout the freaking app so the moral
476:50 - of the story is don't be a potato uh oh
476:53 - gosh what have I done now all right
476:56 - let's close this all right
476:58 - all right good
476:59 - cheese okay good good good good now
477:03 - let's go ahead and style this sucker
477:05 - alright so I'm gonna go to my uh phone
477:07 - confirmation module.css and we're going
477:10 - to create styling for this thing those
477:12 - Go Phone confirm and do container like
477:16 - this let's add a padding to it so I'll
477:19 - go 3M by 1.7 em just like this all right
477:23 - let's hit refresh have to refresh every
477:26 - second but that's okay and then we're
477:29 - gonna go display Flex oh so pretty Flex
477:34 - Direction remember call them that thing
477:36 - and you will be much better if you put
477:39 - it in a row you'll probably not be
477:41 - better because row is default and align
477:44 - items will go Center and um so that's
477:48 - vertical alignment okay and then we're
477:50 - going to do justify content Center and
477:52 - that will that will horizontally align
477:55 - things okay let's go height and we'll go
477:58 - 100 VH so that like kind of centers it
478:01 - okay and then I'm gonna do background
478:04 - color and of course we're going to pick
478:06 - uh rap what the what is a wrap
478:09 - color oh okay never mind there's like a
478:11 - weird shortcut that was totally
478:13 - unnecessary let's just add the normal
478:15 - color for Clubhouse clone so I'm gonna
478:18 - go F2 F0 E4 all right and now we'll have
478:23 - the clubhouse color okay just keep
478:25 - refreshing like a maniac and things
478:27 - should be good and then I want to go
478:29 - position relative
478:32 - all right so that's good now we're going
478:35 - to style the H1 just it just a little
478:39 - bit so phone confirm container and I'm
478:43 - going to grab the H1 of this and I'm
478:44 - going to say hey give me a font size of
478:46 - 1.3 am
478:48 - so we're gonna make that a little bit
478:50 - smaller it was really big font weight of
478:54 - 500 font style I'm gonna just have
478:57 - normal and then let's go margin bottom
479:01 - zero and we'll give it a color of our
479:05 - text color okay so this is our clubhouse
479:07 - style text color and then lastly okay
479:12 - actually there's few more things we want
479:14 - to do here but let's still go phone
479:15 - confirm container let's grab the text so
479:18 - the paragraph tags and uh we're gonna
479:20 - give it a different font size let's
479:23 - refresh okay so the that font size is
479:25 - much smaller as you can see here go font
479:28 - weight go font style will be normal
479:32 - margin of zero we'll go width of a
479:37 - hundred percent on it and then Max width
479:40 - I'm gonna say 270 pixels so it's looking
479:43 - more centered on mobile devices now and
479:46 - uh text align of course Center and then
479:50 - justify content and for this one we can
479:53 - even do space evenly and we should be
479:56 - good and then the actual last one where
479:59 - we have terms of service and privacy
480:01 - policy now this should look different
480:03 - than the rest of the rest of everything
480:05 - so let's style it differently okay so
480:07 - again let's grab the P tag and the span
480:11 - tag with inside of the P tag okay that's
480:14 - basically what I'm saying there and I'm
480:16 - just going to give it a font weight of
480:18 - 500. okay let's refresh and you can see
480:21 - it looks just a little bit Bolder than
480:23 - the rest of the things okay and for now
480:26 - that's that's pretty much actually let
480:29 - me go here yeah this is pretty good
480:31 - right now okay I hope that you're
480:33 - enjoying this so far uh we're gonna keep
480:35 - going and the next functionality that
480:37 - we're actually gonna add is we're gonna
480:39 - add um links so you can actually go
480:42 - forward and then eventually so you can
480:44 - also like click the back button and go
480:46 - back from this page otherwise can just
480:49 - be stuck just stuck on this page for the
480:51 - rest of your life alright so let's
480:52 - actually add the input for where people
480:55 - can put in their phone number so for
480:57 - example when I go to the invite page I
481:00 - can now put in my phone number right
481:02 - here okay so we're gonna add that to our
481:05 - uh invite page as well right now we just
481:08 - have enter your phone by entering your
481:09 - number you're agreeing to blah blah blah
481:11 - let's put that and work on that now so
481:14 - first things first I'm going to need to
481:16 - install a library from react so we're
481:19 - going to do yarn add or npm install both
481:23 - are okay react phone number input just
481:27 - like that all right not input input with
481:30 - an end hit enter so that's going to go
481:32 - ahead and install this library on your
481:35 - computer and you'll be able to use this
481:38 - okay and then let's go to our phone
481:40 - confirmation page here and we're going
481:44 - to add this phone input okay so let's go
481:47 - ahead right underneath the H1 I'll add
481:50 - my phone input and now watch I'm going
481:52 - to hover over this hit enter and it
481:55 - should have Auto completed it so or or
481:58 - imported it so you see right there it
482:00 - automatically imported it okay if it did
482:02 - and then just go ahead and import it and
482:04 - we're going to do phone input and inside
482:05 - of this input and actually this will be
482:07 - a self-closing tag like this all right
482:10 - and you can already start to see that
482:12 - the input is showing up here I can
482:14 - choose International I can put a phone
482:17 - number in so really cool comes with some
482:20 - logos and stuff like that too we're
482:21 - gonna definitely have to style this I'm
482:23 - going to say International okay and then
482:26 - I'm going to say default country and us
482:30 - if you don't know what parameters it has
482:32 - you saw how it all kind of Auto
482:34 - completes it so that'll show you what
482:36 - kind of uh parameters you can play with
482:39 - and after default country we have value
482:41 - which we're going to set to value and
482:44 - that's again coming from whatever you
482:46 - might type in here okay we're going to
482:47 - need access to to this and then that's
482:51 - kind of kind of it actually all right
482:54 - now that we've added the input what I
482:56 - want to do is um I kind of want to add
482:59 - some of the arrow links that we were
483:01 - talking about and arrows for like being
483:03 - able to go forward and at some point
483:05 - being able to go backwards so let's go
483:07 - ahead and do that okay so I'm gonna work
483:11 - on that with you now so I'm gonna go
483:14 - into my phone
483:15 - confirmation.js which I'm already here
483:18 - so that's great and we're going to do a
483:20 - couple of things okay so all the way at
483:22 - the top or we have the phone confirm
483:25 - container right underneath that I'm
483:28 - actually going to add a link and in this
483:31 - link I'm going to say okay I'm going to
483:34 - do this and I'm going to give it a class
483:36 - name of style dot back button and then
483:41 - inside of here we're actually going to
483:43 - use that image well you're like hey Kazi
483:46 - where's that image let me show oh yeah
483:49 - so you're gonna have your own images
483:50 - file but in public images we have them
483:54 - all here okay so I'm gonna need arrow
483:56 - and next Arrow pretty soon so I'm just
483:57 - gonna get both of them for now whoops
484:00 - and um inside of my public right I can
484:04 - create a new folder and I can call it
484:06 - images and I can put my images inside of
484:10 - there okay so let's go ahead and I'm
484:13 - gonna grab my images again when I had
484:15 - them boom boom boom public images and I
484:19 - got my next Arrow and arrow cool take
484:22 - them drop them and now we got them both
484:24 - so I got my SVG one and I got my regular
484:27 - Arrow cool beautiful let me put my phone
484:30 - on silent so nobody can harass me like
484:32 - that again and let's keep going so now
484:35 - let's actually add that image I'm gonna
484:37 - do images Arrow dot PNG okay now let's
484:41 - go to the slash invite page misspelled
484:44 - it okay great we have that image showing
484:47 - up it doesn't look so good but it is
484:51 - showing up so that's a really good sign
484:53 - now let's go underneath here and I'm
484:55 - also going to add another link and in
484:57 - this link I'm going to say exact two and
485:01 - we're gonna go to code confirm and then
485:04 - I'm gonna give it a class name of
485:08 - let's see if I can
485:09 - um first add the the text and then the
485:12 - image okay so let's go here I'm going to
485:14 - say next all right where is that next
485:16 - it's all at the bottom okay so you will
485:18 - see this next Aldo at the bottom might
485:21 - be a little hard to see but there it is
485:22 - okay let's zoom out maybe just a little
485:25 - bit oh already the navigation is working
485:28 - so that's a good sign cool and now to
485:31 - this next I'm actually going to add add
485:33 - an image okay so we're going to say IMG
485:36 - Tab and then the source I'm going to
485:38 - give it is my next Arrow
485:41 - icon.svg and then let's now go ahead and
485:44 - start styling this thing slash and then
485:48 - I will say class name equals ml1 and
485:53 - that that made a little uh you saw what
485:56 - it did right so for example if I remove
485:58 - this class name and hit save the next
486:00 - button you'll see that it actually moves
486:02 - a little bit to the left okay and this
486:05 - is happening uh because of bootstrap now
486:07 - I'm also gonna add a class name to this
486:11 - at the top where I kind of left it blank
486:13 - and what I'm going to say is the
486:15 - following give it a primary button see
486:17 - if that does anything refresh okay so
486:20 - that's the top uh the next Arrow image
486:23 - it's the the next button right here okay
486:26 - so right now you can't see the image
486:29 - that's next to next okay it's really
486:31 - hard to see it it's right there and uh
486:34 - don't worry we're going to be able to
486:36 - see more of it once we style it more
486:38 - okay so for now just kind of like hang
486:41 - in there okay let's go here and uh that
486:45 - probably looks better for mobile okay so
486:47 - we'll we'll leave it at this okay I know
486:50 - it's a little uh kind of like a little
486:52 - difficult to see some of these things
486:54 - but I think you should be fine right now
486:55 - so that image is there now let's go
486:58 - primary button I'm gonna say deflects
487:01 - here and then I'm gonna go and align
487:04 - items Center and basically now what we
487:07 - need to do is go ahead and actually
487:10 - start styling this stuff so I'm gonna go
487:13 - to okay guys so a couple of things I
487:16 - want to do so one thing I want to do is
487:18 - I want to go to my app CSS file and um I
487:22 - want to make sure that my button here
487:25 - doesn't really have any styling so it
487:27 - doesn't come with any outline okay I'm
487:30 - just going to say important right here
487:31 - the next thing I want to do is I want to
487:33 - make sure that my link tags don't really
487:35 - have any underlines on them okay so
487:38 - that's why I'm adding this to my
487:40 - app.css file okay so we'll do text
487:43 - declaration none Okay cool so I
487:46 - shouldn't have really any errors going
487:48 - into this now you'll notice that I added
487:50 - this class name to this next Arrow image
487:53 - and I said primary button but we don't
487:56 - really have a primary button class so
487:59 - let's go ahead and add the CSS for our
488:03 - primary button and let's go ahead and do
488:04 - that now all right so now let's go to
488:07 - our app CSS success and add this code
488:10 - there okay so app.css is right here and
488:14 - we're gonna add it in okay so I'm going
488:16 - to say primary I'm going to grab my
488:18 - primary button class and we'll give it a
488:21 - background color of let's just start off
488:23 - with a pink background color and so you
488:26 - can see now it's highlighted okay the R
488:29 - button so I'll change this background
488:33 - color from that to something that makes
488:35 - much more sense we'll use our variable
488:37 - okay and I'm going to say a button
488:40 - background color like this so now you
488:43 - see that it has this like blue color
488:46 - behind it but it still looks a little
488:48 - bit ugly so let's keep working on it all
488:50 - right let's um zoom out just a little
488:52 - bit now I wanna I wanna add some color
488:56 - to this okay so let's make that how many
488:59 - yes we got here cool so let's make that
489:01 - white I'll add a border or radius and
489:04 - we'll go with two em on this one cool so
489:07 - that that gives it those like nice
489:09 - little rounded corners but it's still
489:11 - you know kind of hideous so let's you
489:14 - know let's make it let's make it work
489:16 - I'll add a little bit of padding to this
489:18 - okay wow that padding really made a lot
489:22 - of difference right you saw the button
489:24 - kind of just let me remove the padding
489:26 - and let me add the padding and that just
489:28 - makes a world of a difference so
489:30 - remember these patterns as you're making
489:32 - buttons as you're making whatever you're
489:34 - making just a little bit of padding or a
489:36 - little bit of margin can make such a
489:37 - huge difference and then I'm gonna give
489:40 - it a font size of 1.2 em okay and if
489:44 - you'd never see changes just hit refresh
489:46 - so you saw the font size get bigger and
489:48 - it's a little bit easier to see now
489:50 - we'll give it a font weight of 500
489:53 - that's good now it looks a little bit
489:55 - Bolder and then font style I'm gonna go
489:57 - normal cool text align I am gonna say
490:02 - Center on this okay so I think that is
490:07 - looking really really good and let's go
490:10 - back to our app CSS file so now this is
490:12 - looking good now pretty soon we're going
490:14 - to need to bring this back arrow button
490:16 - and con into control because it's it's
490:19 - all over the place and honestly it's
490:21 - taking over our entire app and you know
490:23 - taking over my entire life so I'm gonna
490:25 - fix this now all right so now let's go
490:28 - back to our phone confirmation and here
490:31 - we look look we did we did value right
490:34 - but how is that value going to get
490:37 - changed you see the set value is still
490:39 - unused and that's really how you
490:41 - actually change variables that are like
490:43 - State variables in react right so I
490:46 - still need to do like on change what I
490:49 - want to say is hey call this call my set
490:53 - value okay and that's going to actually
490:55 - allow me to accept the new value and
490:57 - actually make a change happen cool and
490:59 - that's going to update our value in here
491:02 - okay so now let me type stuff in great
491:05 - that looks good because if you actually
491:07 - go back back and you take that on change
491:10 - out right so like if you comment that
491:12 - out watch what happens if I go and I try
491:15 - to type in my phone number I'm going to
491:17 - get an error and it's going to say hey
491:18 - on change is not a function okay and so
491:21 - here let me bring this back and now when
491:25 - I actually try to write it knows
491:26 - actually what to do with that cool so
491:29 - this is looking good now what I want to
491:32 - do is I want to actually add that back
491:35 - arrow and give it a little bit of
491:37 - styling Okay so we've already added that
491:40 - back arrow and now let's go to our phone
491:45 - confirmation.module.css and we've we've
491:47 - added some Styles in here but now we're
491:49 - going to actually add the styles for
491:51 - this button right here because remember
491:53 - this this image is kind of crazy right
491:56 - so I'm gonna actually do back button and
491:59 - we're gonna give it a position absolute
492:01 - okay so now it's like right in the
492:05 - center all right so now if you actually
492:07 - comment it out right it's actually in
492:09 - line with every other element but
492:11 - actually if I make position absolute it
492:13 - is going to be smack on top of
492:16 - everything that's what position absolute
492:18 - does and uh let's give it a top of 10
492:21 - pixels like this okay and then we're
492:24 - going to give it a left of 10 pixels
492:26 - like that cool and then the last thing
492:28 - we're going to do is we're going to
492:30 - bring that image size under control okay
492:32 - so I'm going to select the image I'm
492:34 - going to give it a width of 20 pixels
492:37 - and there you go that's it okay that uh
492:40 - resizing just changes the game and now
492:42 - we got the back button here we got our
492:45 - next looking good okay we got the big
492:48 - American flag in the middle put your
492:49 - phone number in and I mean I don't know
492:51 - this the screen is starting to look
492:53 - pretty damn good to me with that said
492:55 - let's keep on going all right now I
492:57 - actually want to work on the
492:59 - confirmation screen okay so for example
493:02 - what's the confirmation screen you ask
493:03 - Kazi what's the confirmation screen all
493:06 - right don't worry let me freaking show
493:07 - you okay so I go here I hit next and
493:11 - this is the confirmation screen so this
493:13 - is a very simple screen that's what
493:14 - we're going to work on right now and um
493:16 - it's going to be quite simple okay so
493:19 - let's go inside of our source inside of
493:22 - our source I'm going to
493:24 - um go inside of our pages and in my
493:26 - pages I'm going to create a new file and
493:27 - it's going to be called code
493:29 - confirm.js just like that okay inside of
493:33 - here I'm going to do import react from
493:35 - react like this I want to also get my
493:39 - Styles okay from that slash style slash
493:43 - phone confirm dot
493:46 - module.css cool so this should be in
493:51 - under my pages Pages code confirm
493:54 - beautiful then you back out you go into
493:56 - style okay that's that's good all right
493:59 - and then I'm also going to need my link
494:01 - because that allows me to go to
494:04 - different links without having to
494:05 - refresh okay that's a better a way to
494:08 - better than using the a tag that's what
494:11 - I recommend in react so now let's uh
494:14 - export default function so you don't
494:16 - have to write an additional export line
494:18 - if you just do that here and this
494:19 - component will be called code confirm
494:22 - okay and then in here I'm going to
494:25 - create a div it's going to have a class
494:28 - name of style DOT phone confirm
494:32 - container so we're going to now reuse
494:34 - some of the styling and the code that
494:36 - we've already done we're going to have
494:37 - another div here it's going to have a
494:39 - class name of text Center and this right
494:42 - here text center it's a bootstrap it's
494:46 - it's a bootstrap thing that is basically
494:48 - shorthand for doing text align Center
494:50 - okay so just makes your life a little
494:53 - bit easier now inside of here I'm going
494:56 - to make an H1 okay and then this H1 I'm
494:59 - just pretty much going to say enter the
495:01 - code we just texted you we're gonna
495:05 - actually need to see this so let's go
495:06 - ahead and actually to create the routing
495:08 - for this so we can see this freaking
495:10 - page okay so let's go to our app.js and
495:15 - in here we'll create the routing for so
495:17 - I'm going to say import code confirm
495:19 - from and we'll do Pages slash code
495:23 - confirm so I'm going to get that
495:25 - component and then at the end here I'm
495:28 - going to say let's go like this and for
495:32 - the path it's going to be code confirm
495:34 - and of course show me this component
495:38 - code confirm oh did I misspell it should
495:41 - be confirm
495:42 - confirm and let's actually go to this
495:45 - file and let's do I mean it's confirm
495:48 - everywhere okay I might have just
495:50 - misspelled it here then okay so let's
495:53 - try going here and doing code underscore
495:55 - confirm hit enter uh nothing was
495:58 - returned oh yeah because we don't have a
496:00 - return statements so we'll just do for
496:02 - now I'm just going to do a return and I
496:05 - will wrap this whole thing up in an
496:07 - expression like this save boom okay
496:10 - enter the code we just texted you so so
496:12 - far it's looking good now this H1 let's
496:15 - style it in a specific way so what I'm
496:18 - going to say is uh I'm gonna style it
496:21 - okay actually let's add all the content
496:24 - first and then I'm gonna style it so
496:26 - let's add a P tag inside of this div and
496:30 - basically in this P tag I'm just going
496:32 - to say it didn't receive receive it okay
496:35 - and then we'll have a span tag in here
496:39 - and then in that span tag I'm just going
496:41 - to say tap to resend okay so just like
496:45 - that then receive it tap to resend
496:46 - beautiful now for this H1 I'm going to
496:49 - say give it a um not last name I'll do
496:52 - style and we'll do I'm gonna give it a
496:56 - jsx expression and I'm gonna just give
496:58 - it a object inside of it okay it's just
497:02 - a simple JavaScript object and in here
497:05 - I'm going to say with will be 100 this
497:08 - is inline styling okay Max width will be
497:11 - 200 pixels and then we will use
497:15 - um margin bottom will be 1 em so enter
497:19 - the text we just enter the code we just
497:21 - texted you didn't receive it tap to
497:23 - resend and it looks looks pretty
497:25 - freaking good all right and then for my
497:28 - P tag I'm going to give it a little bit
497:30 - of styling as well we'll go class name
497:33 - mt-2 let's hit save so again remove it
497:37 - refresh
497:38 - bring it back mt-2 now with this empty
497:43 - two you might not see the difference
497:45 - right away but once we actually add the
497:47 - input box where you actually put in your
497:50 - number okay so for example
497:53 - um here you're actually going to see the
497:55 - difference all right so we'll talk about
497:57 - that once we add it other than that I
498:01 - think as far as this specific page slash
498:04 - screen slash component is concerned the
498:06 - code confirm one I think it's looking
498:08 - good and uh let's now start working on
498:11 - the input okay so now we're going to
498:15 - work on the input box over here so let's
498:18 - put that right underneath the H1 simply
498:20 - do input the type is going to be text
498:23 - because yes we're going to be putting in
498:25 - text in there and then we're going to do
498:27 - styling all right so let's go style I'm
498:30 - going to go with in here I'm going to
498:32 - give it a hundred percent width okay so
498:34 - you just saw this got a little bit wider
498:37 - that's perfect
498:38 - um now all right let's um let's actually
498:42 - do it like an object okay okay with 100
498:45 - I'm going to give it a border of none so
498:48 - let's get rid of uh the border around it
498:51 - let's go down all right and sometimes
498:53 - you know if it doesn't show up just hit
498:55 - refresh because I don't know why but
498:57 - sometimes the code just won't load up
498:59 - okay so just hit refresh the Border
499:01 - should now be gone and it should look
499:03 - much cleaner we're gonna do text align
499:07 - okay and I'm going to do Center like
499:10 - this cool
499:12 - um and then I'm gonna do outline I'm
499:14 - gonna say uh none what does this text
499:17 - align line do notice we're now about to
499:19 - write I'm writing from the left hand
499:21 - side right text align Center I write I
499:24 - write from the middle so that's good
499:25 - okay so this code confirm screen
499:28 - honestly looks uh pretty good let's just
499:31 - move forward now so we're going to add
499:33 - the next and previous uh buttons to this
499:36 - so we can actually go back or forward
499:37 - right because otherwise we're just going
499:39 - to get stuck here so we want this and
499:41 - this luckily we just created it and this
499:43 - is where you're going to start seeing
499:45 - um some of the power of react this is
499:48 - we're going to see the power of react
499:49 - okay so let's keep on rocking and
499:51 - rolling so inside of our code confirm
499:54 - I'm going to go all the way up right
499:57 - underneath here and I'm going to add a
500:01 - link tag like that I'm going to say
500:04 - exact
500:05 - 2 and we're going to say get username
500:09 - like that and we'll have a class name
500:12 - and the class name will be style dot
500:16 - back button okay and of course let's
500:19 - give it an image so we'll go image on
500:22 - here and I'm going to say slash Images
500:24 - slash arrow.png okay so now that button
500:29 - is there okay now one more thing we need
500:32 - to add and we'll add it underneath this
500:34 - div is create a link I'm going to say
500:37 - exact two we'll say allow underscore
500:42 - notifications
500:43 - notification okay I think that's because
500:46 - that's going to be another one of our
500:47 - screens and then here I'm going to say
500:50 - class name and let's put that okay let's
500:54 - put that below so class name and I'll
500:57 - say primary button Flex align items
501:01 - Center like that cool so now that button
501:05 - is there and it's looking good it's
501:07 - inheriting the styling from primary
501:09 - that's what we wanted okay and um I want
501:12 - to of course give it some text right so
501:15 - here I'm just gonna say next and then
501:17 - we'll give it an image images slash next
501:19 - Arrow icon dot SVG so now that uh little
501:25 - image is there okay let's hit refresh
501:28 - great great great great great okay
501:31 - that's the image that we wanted and then
501:33 - of course we'll do class name equals and
501:36 - we'll go ml1 on this and again this is a
501:40 - bootstrap cool so now this is looking uh
501:43 - this is looking good okay and it's doing
501:46 - what we want it to do so let's keep on
501:48 - going all right so I don't like that uh
501:51 - underline that's happening underneath
501:52 - the next so let's go to our app CSS and
501:55 - what I'm gonna do here is I'm just gonna
501:57 - do a hover okay and on this hover I'm
502:00 - gonna say text decoration and let's go
502:03 - with none okay and let's go let's
502:06 - refresh hover over it okay it's still
502:08 - giving us problems let's hit save here
502:11 - so let's actually go ahead and debug and
502:14 - see what's going on here all right let's
502:16 - go ahead and add the important right
502:19 - here hit save go over and boom look it's
502:22 - gone okay so
502:24 - um sometimes you just have to add that
502:26 - important to take precedence over maybe
502:27 - some of the other styling you have or if
502:29 - you're using bootstrap maybe their text
502:31 - decoration or their on Hover with the a
502:34 - tag is taking precedence but doing
502:35 - important you say hey forget all that
502:37 - this is what takes importance and go
502:40 - with this one all right so now let's add
502:42 - our notification page okay that's going
502:45 - to be another one of our screens so I'm
502:48 - gonna go inside of my pages here and I'm
502:51 - going to right click and we're going to
502:53 - go and add a new file and it's going to
502:56 - be allow
502:58 - notification.js and in this file I'm
503:01 - going to say import react from react
503:05 - like this cool we're also going to
503:08 - import style from
503:11 - all right we've done this a couple of
503:13 - times now phone confirm dot module.css
503:17 - like that and then I'm going to do
503:19 - import link from react router Dom okay
503:25 - all right and then export the function
503:28 - so let's make our component now is going
503:30 - to be called allow notification okay and
503:34 - just you're clear on what we're building
503:36 - here is
503:37 - this one this screen right there all
503:40 - right this is a really this is really
503:41 - important for building out a proper user
503:44 - flow you need to have all of these
503:46 - things in there so I'm going to say div
503:47 - okay and um this is going to have a
503:51 - class name of style DOT phone confirm
503:56 - container like so okay inside of here
503:59 - I'm going to have another div and I'm
504:02 - going to Center align it so let's go
504:04 - ahead and uh class name text Center okay
504:08 - inside of here I'm going to have an H1
504:11 - and that H1 will say last important step
504:16 - like this let's go to ours um okay and
504:19 - let's actually go ahead and connect this
504:22 - to our app JS and add it to our routing
504:25 - so we can actually go to this page okay
504:27 - so I'm going to import allow
504:28 - notification from actually we don't need
504:31 - this because we should just be able to
504:33 - use this component okay so I'm gonna go
504:37 - here and I'm going to say allow
504:38 - notification and hit save and it's
504:41 - already imported at the top and the
504:43 - exact path to get here will be allow
504:45 - underscore notification so now let's
504:48 - change that URL to allow underscore
504:51 - notification all right and I'll hit
504:53 - enter and I'm on this page uh-huh
504:56 - nothing was returned so we just have to
504:58 - make sure we wrap this thing in a return
505:02 - statement like this save last important
505:05 - step is now showing up okay that's good
505:08 - now inside of here I want to add in
505:11 - another H1 and I'm going to say enable
505:14 - notifications to know when people are
505:20 - speaking okay or talking like that cool
505:24 - now let's start giving it a styling so
505:27 - I'll give this one an H1 and we'll say
505:31 - mb-4 alright so you saw that it gave it
505:35 - a few like line breaks here okay okay
505:38 - that was helpful and then we will do for
505:41 - this H1 as well we'll do something
505:43 - similar and I'll say class name and
505:45 - we'll go
505:46 - mb-3 okay so that moved it up a little
505:49 - bit okay so that's margin bottom right
505:51 - short for I believe margin bottom and
505:53 - that's how we we add margin Bottoms in
505:56 - bootstrap I suck at bootstrap but this
505:58 - is fun right like we're all learning
506:00 - something and we're implementing it in
506:02 - this project and using it so that's
506:03 - super cool now let's work on adding the
506:06 - notification pop-up okay so like this
506:09 - little thing here we'll work on that so
506:12 - how we need to do that is first of all
506:14 - go ahead and grab the image so it's
506:17 - going to be the in the image folder
506:18 - that's in the description of the video
506:20 - that you can get access to okay that's
506:22 - where all the files are going to be
506:23 - images all the assets you'll ever need
506:25 - grab this image um this SVG and put it
506:30 - inside of your public images folder like
506:32 - so okay so now we have it now with that
506:35 - said let's go ahead and work on more on
506:38 - or allow notification component okay so
506:43 - right underneath this H1 we're going to
506:46 - create a div and it'll have a class name
506:49 - of style dot notification container and
506:54 - don't worry we'll create that styling
506:55 - okay let's just add all the content
506:58 - first and then we will create the
507:00 - styling for it so just breathe for me
507:03 - breathe in breathe out and relax it'll
507:07 - all be just fine should I
507:10 - all right that was bad but whatever I'm
507:12 - gonna add it in anyway okay uh next up
507:16 - let's create another div
507:18 - okay and I'm gonna give it a class name
507:20 - of uh P3 so this is shorthand for
507:24 - padding in all directions in bootstrap
507:27 - okay way nicer than having to do that in
507:29 - CSS is kind of annoying all right now
507:31 - within here we're going to make an H3
507:34 - and uh this is going to say Clubhouse
507:38 - would like would like to send actually
507:42 - let's um camel case everything would
507:44 - like to send you notifications just like
507:49 - that cool let's get out of that H3 and
507:52 - we're gonna have a P tag and it's going
507:54 - to say notifications may include alerts
507:57 - sounds and icon batches so we got our H3
508:03 - that's good you should have your
508:05 - paragraph tag with that information now
508:07 - let's go ahead and um let's get out of
508:11 - this div and let's go underneath here
508:13 - and we're going to create a new div okay
508:16 - and this will have a class name of style
508:19 - dot action button okay and inside of
508:24 - here I'm going to be using a link and
508:26 - this link will do the following okay
508:29 - exact two and this link will take me to
508:34 - the home page and this will basically
508:37 - the text will say
508:39 - don't allow okay so we have the Sexes
508:42 - don't allow when I click it I just get
508:44 - redirected to the home page you saw the
508:46 - URL change at the top that's it simple
508:49 - we'll have another link and this will
508:52 - also take us to the home page so let's
508:54 - actually what I'm going to do is um
508:57 - let's just paste this and we're going to
508:59 - remove the word don't so we have don't
509:01 - allow and then we have the word allow
509:03 - okay and with styling we're gonna
509:05 - separate them out from each other so
509:06 - they're not so close and then let's
509:08 - create an image and the image source is
509:11 - going to be hand icon.svg
509:15 - look at that look at how good that looks
509:17 - okay it's coming together okay just have
509:21 - some hope faith and some patience it'll
509:23 - all come together and it'll look
509:24 - beautiful just like you you are
509:27 - beautiful and I want you to remember
509:29 - that as you watch this tutorial and if
509:31 - you're enjoying this so far smash that
509:33 - goddamn like button break the Subscribe
509:35 - button and help me and help us make this
509:38 - the best community for developers in the
509:40 - world and beat the YouTube algorithm
509:42 - while we're at it back to the tutorial
509:45 - okay so let me um yep so we got this
509:50 - image okay don't care that much about
509:52 - the alt stuff right now and let's go
509:56 - ahead and give it a class name and I'm
509:58 - going to do style dot hand icon okay
510:01 - we'll we'll create styling for it do not
510:04 - worry okay so now all this stuff is done
510:07 - now it's time for the fun stuff we're
510:09 - gonna go ahead and style this page okay
510:11 - all the content is there now let's work
510:14 - on our styling so I'm gonna go to our
510:16 - phone confirm
510:17 - module.css and inside of here let's
510:21 - start off with the notification
510:22 - container okay so I'll go notification
510:26 - container like so
510:29 - um and I'll give it a border radius of
510:32 - uh one em not one m
510:34 - okay okay so we got our border radius
510:37 - now you won't be able to see it until I
510:40 - actually add the Border okay so let's go
510:43 - ahead and um add a uh background color
510:46 - and we will add
510:47 - um I'll make the background color white
510:49 - okay so there you go okay if I remove
510:52 - the Border radius look at that it looks
510:54 - like a square and it looks kind of ugly
510:56 - then I do this and it already kind of
510:59 - looks delicious and you're like man that
511:01 - looks juicy I like it I don't know where
511:03 - it's headed but I am liking this and now
511:06 - we're going to give it a box Shadow and
511:08 - box shadow of zero pixels by zero pixels
511:11 - by five pixels and then we're gonna go
511:13 - like this
511:15 - look at that that drop shadow just makes
511:18 - it pop out and it just looks visually so
511:21 - damn good but a few more touches so work
511:24 - with me here let's go here I'm gonna go
511:26 - notification container let's grab H3 by
511:30 - the balls okay hopefully there are no
511:32 - kids listening to this but um you you
511:34 - know in that case it's just juggling
511:36 - balls and we will give it
511:38 - um font size of one em cool what happens
511:42 - if I let go of this oh okay so it makes
511:45 - it much smaller right boom you saw the
511:47 - H3 get under control because the H3 was
511:49 - ridiculous and uh we'll give it a font
511:52 - weight of uh 500. okay it said refresh
511:56 - cool and then
511:58 - um font style won't really matter I'll
512:00 - give it a color of zero zero zero zero
512:03 - zero like this okay so it's like kind of
512:07 - dark black
512:09 - um very subtle difference there but
512:11 - definitely you can see it if you look
512:13 - closely and then with we're gonna go
512:16 - hundred percent okay boom so let's go
512:20 - and I'm gonna margin Auto this thing
512:23 - okay and um then after this let's go
512:26 - margin bottom let's add a little margin
512:29 - bottom and I'm gonna go with 0.3 em okay
512:33 - makes a little bit of a difference gives
512:35 - us some more breathing room
512:37 - and now let's control the P tags okay so
512:40 - we're gonna go ahead and do that so I'm
512:42 - gonna go notification container we'll
512:44 - grab the P tags and then I'm going to
512:47 - say font size let's go 0.825 em cool
512:52 - let's go refresh
512:53 - and then um let's go font weight 500
512:58 - okay so now this is starting to look a
513:00 - little bit better I'm gonna go line
513:03 - height of 1.3 so that reduced the line
513:07 - height by a little bit and then let's go
513:09 - margin Auto on it okay so that allowed
513:13 - it to kind of be Center aligned good
513:16 - next up
513:17 - grab the notification container and grab
513:20 - the action button class like this and in
513:23 - here I'm just going to say position
513:25 - relative and then what we're going to do
513:28 - is let's grab the action button class
513:31 - and inside of the action button class
513:33 - let's grab the a tags and we're gonna do
513:36 - a couple of things so first of all I'm
513:38 - going to say display and I'm going to
513:40 - say inline block
513:42 - okay all right so now what I want to do
513:44 - is with 50
513:46 - okay wow that looks great so don't allow
513:51 - and allow or separated all right so now
513:54 - what I want to do is uh let's give it a
513:56 - padding of 0.5 em nice okay that looks
514:02 - great and I'm going to give it a border
514:04 - top of one pixel solid and we'll make it
514:08 - like so oh
514:11 - so clean okay we got a border top now
514:15 - let's go color let's use our variable
514:17 - and use this and what that did is it
514:22 - changed the color of the button okay now
514:23 - watch what happens when I comment this
514:25 - line out and I'm going to hit save keep
514:27 - looking at the colors they're like blue
514:28 - blue right but then when I do this and
514:31 - hit save they're like depressing
514:34 - turquoise color which I don't know why
514:36 - Clubhouse uses those colors it kind of
514:38 - depresses me but they like to use it so
514:40 - we're going to be using this
514:42 - um dope okay good now let's go again
514:45 - notification container action button
514:48 - inside of it and then we're gonna grab
514:50 - the a uh tags and we're gonna get the
514:53 - first child of the a tags okay and
514:55 - inside of here let's go border right
514:58 - dope and go one pixel solid and that
515:02 - little gray color okay what broke this
515:05 - time all right so this is what got added
515:09 - right now okay right there that's what
515:12 - God added and um that's looking good now
515:15 - let's work with the hand icon so I'm
515:17 - gonna go
515:18 - um notification container let's grab the
515:20 - hand icon inside of there and uh we'll
515:23 - go position absolute and we will go
515:26 - bottom negative 90 pixels okay let's
515:31 - refresh oh where is that image we don't
515:35 - even see that image that image is gone
515:37 - it's invisible but the card the card
515:40 - looks freaking beautiful right the card
515:44 - looks freaking great just because it is
515:46 - border right that added that the other
515:49 - border top added this I mean it's just
515:51 - clean and now let's go ahead and go
515:54 - right and I'm gonna go 20 pixels okay so
515:58 - now we got the hand showing up the hand
516:01 - of God and we'll give it a width of 80
516:04 - pixels boom home and now it's telling
516:09 - people hey go ahead and allow it okay go
516:12 - ahead and allow it so that this page
516:15 - looks good it makes you want to click
516:17 - allow so then this Page's job is
516:19 - therefore done okay good job if you've
516:22 - made it so far and let's just keep going
516:24 - okay let's not stop and now what we're
516:26 - gonna do is we're gonna create a routing
516:29 - container and it's going to separate
516:30 - routes between logged in users versus
516:33 - logged out users so let's go ahead and
516:36 - go do that right now oh all right so
516:38 - let's go to our app JS and in here I'm
516:42 - also going to add switch all right like
516:45 - Drake says I just flipped the switch now
516:48 - I'm going to show you how to flip the
516:50 - freaking switch and under browser router
516:53 - I'm going to do a few things here okay
516:55 - so I'm gonna say route and inside of
516:58 - here I'm going to say exact and here's
517:00 - something cool I can do I can say path
517:02 - okay and uh there's a couple of reasons
517:04 - for this one it for this is going to be
517:06 - extra added layer of security like
517:08 - people will not even be able to go to
517:10 - these pads
517:12 - um or I'm sorry people will only be able
517:14 - to go to the paths that are inside of
517:16 - this array okay so for example slash so
517:19 - it's going to be the home path for like
517:21 - or the default page right your localhost
517:23 - or your main domain of your website and
517:26 - then I'll have slash invite
517:28 - um we'll have slash uh get backslash get
517:31 - username I will also have code confirm
517:34 - boom boom code confirm and then we'll
517:38 - have allow notification okay so what
517:43 - this means is if you try to even go to a
517:46 - path called like slash bananas all right
517:49 - let's go slash bananas you literally
517:53 - will not be able to go to that path at
517:55 - all okay so that's kind of the point of
517:57 - it and it's kind of cool like that and
518:00 - uh this route is going to end all the
518:03 - way at the bottom okay so it's going to
518:05 - be under right underneath where plan
518:06 - layout ends there we go now what we want
518:09 - to do is we want to add a switch
518:12 - statement that's going to allow us to
518:14 - like kind of switch between which one we
518:17 - want okay I'm going to say switch and
518:19 - I'm going to wrap this thing up in the
518:20 - switch okay so switch is going to end
518:23 - right above the plan layout right there
518:26 - let's see what the error is I got plan
518:29 - layout
518:31 - hmm
518:32 - oh my bad yeah this makes no sense so
518:34 - switch is just going to be inside of
518:36 - plan layout okay there we go cool so we
518:40 - got our switch we got our plan layout
518:43 - um a better way of calling it would be
518:45 - like the onboarding layout right so it's
518:47 - like what's the default layout we want
518:50 - on the onboarding screens and onboarding
518:53 - process when the user is signing up so
518:55 - that's gonna have one style of layout
518:58 - and then we're gonna have a different
519:00 - style of layout once the user is
519:03 - actually logged in okay so like for
519:06 - example
519:07 - this is the user flow right so if I go
519:09 - to the home page here this is a
519:12 - completed version of the app not the
519:14 - home page let's go to let's say the
519:16 - default one right you'll notice that all
519:19 - the text is kind of usually in the
519:20 - middle and there's this background color
519:22 - and there's no buttons or things on the
519:26 - top okay it has a very like similar uh
519:29 - Style Now go to invite consistent style
519:32 - okay same thing text and content is kind
519:35 - of in the middle there's no big things
519:38 - on the top and there you go right but
519:40 - now watch what happens once the user has
519:42 - signed up so let's hit next let's hit
519:44 - next let's hit allow now our layout is
519:48 - completely different so once I'm logged
519:50 - in permanently our layout is going to be
519:52 - different right so it doesn't really
519:54 - matter where I go we have like different
519:56 - styles of layout
519:58 - right and uh they're a little bit
520:00 - similar in nature depending on where you
520:02 - click and where you go
520:04 - but right like upcoming for you goes at
520:07 - the Top If I click explore Explorer goes
520:09 - at the top right you have two invites
520:10 - that goes at the Top If I hit
520:12 - notifications the activity where it goes
520:14 - on the top so there is going to be
520:16 - different layout plans so this is
520:17 - important for you to conceptually
520:19 - understand as we go through this and
520:21 - that's why this freaking thing is so
520:22 - cool here that we're doing okay so
520:25 - that's that you're good with that and
520:28 - now we're gonna keep on rocking and
520:31 - rolling all right so now we're gonna
520:33 - work on the next layout okay so remember
520:36 - layout one the onboarding process layout
520:39 - right that was the aka the plan layout
520:42 - okay and then layout two we're going to
520:46 - call it app layout all right that's
520:48 - gonna be the one that's once the user is
520:51 - logged in so again I'm gonna put in um
520:53 - here parentheses this is going to be for
520:55 - all logged in users and then this is
520:58 - going to be for all uh logged out users
521:01 - okay that's how the structure is going
521:03 - to be so let's keep going boom boom bada
521:07 - bam I will go let's go inside of pages
521:12 - inside of pages inside of layouts we're
521:15 - going to create a new layout so I'm
521:17 - going to set new file and I will simply
521:19 - say app layout dot Js
521:24 - okay and in app layout.js we're going to
521:26 - do a few things import react from react
521:29 - then we're gonna export default function
521:32 - so this is where we're going to create
521:34 - our component it's going to be called
521:35 - app layout and it's going to take in
521:39 - children and I'm assuming it's going to
521:42 - wrap the children inside okay so we're
521:43 - going to go div give it a class name of
521:47 - app layout so then we can you know do
521:50 - something with the styling later on if
521:51 - we wanted to and then it'll just display
521:53 - all the children components within that
521:57 - div and um let's go to our app.js now
522:01 - and in our app.js what I'm going to do
522:04 - is let's go down right underneath where
522:07 - we are actually ending our route right
522:10 - there and we're going to add another
522:12 - route okay and this route is going to be
522:16 - exact path all right and it's going to
522:20 - be an exact path to home okay and we're
522:24 - going to do display app layout here okay
522:28 - app layout like so hit enter so it
522:31 - Imports app layout from pages and
522:34 - layouts close the brackets okay and then
522:37 - here we're going to add our switch cool
522:40 - and um that should be good all right so
522:44 - now we're going to add a home page for
522:47 - logged in users okay so let's go ahead
522:50 - and do that so inside of our switch I'm
522:54 - going to have a route and here I'm going
522:57 - to say exact path path and we're going
523:00 - to say home and the component will be
523:04 - our home component okay just like that
523:08 - so I'm doing this here just to show you
523:11 - like we're just showing you that there
523:13 - are multiple ways of passing in a
523:15 - component I could have also just said
523:17 - home like this I can also remove this
523:21 - Arrow here okay but I'm just going to
523:23 - leave this here so you have multiple
523:24 - ways of how to pass a component okay so
523:28 - that looks good okay so we have our
523:31 - switch there and then our route okay and
523:33 - then this route can be a self-closing
523:35 - tag because there's not much happening
523:37 - in between that so we can make a
523:39 - self-closing tag just like this okay and
523:42 - now let's see what happens if I click
523:45 - home and hit enter all right it says
523:47 - home is not defined great so now we're
523:49 - going to make our home component
523:52 - um so let's go to pages and inside of
523:54 - pages I'll make a new file it will be
523:56 - called home.js
523:58 - okay and in here I'm going to do import
524:01 - react from react and I'm going to do
524:04 - export default function we're going to
524:07 - do home and we'll go and just return a
524:10 - empty div okay let's refresh and now it
524:13 - says home is not defined well that's
524:16 - because we need to import it so we'll
524:18 - import home from slash Pages slash home
524:22 - so now it's there and if I added a H2
524:26 - here that said Hello World
524:28 - um home okay and you can see we got home
524:32 - there on the slash Home Route okay but
524:35 - also you can see that there's no styling
524:37 - so now we're going to go ahead and add
524:39 - that styling
524:41 - so let's go into our app.css file and
524:45 - here I'm going to add styling for our
524:47 - app layout like so and we'll have a
524:51 - background color of a clubhouse okay so
524:55 - you see the you see the background color
524:58 - up there and we'll do height of 100 pH
525:02 - cool so that's taking over the whole
525:04 - screen I'm going to do position relative
525:08 - and then with let's make it a hundred
525:11 - percent okay Max width I'm gonna go with
525:15 - 500 pixels okay and then we'll do margin
525:19 - Auto okay beautiful so now our styling
525:23 - is good to go and now we're ready to do
525:26 - some damage all right now we're gonna
525:28 - work on our header alright so what that
525:31 - means is we're gonna work on all of this
525:33 - and we'll add it and look great and you
525:36 - already know you look great okay so
525:39 - let's go ahead and do that so I'm going
525:41 - gonna go to my com um let's go inside of
525:44 - source okay and now we'll create
525:46 - components because these were pages that
525:48 - we were creating earlier inside of
525:50 - source I'm going to create a new folder
525:52 - I'm going to call it components like so
525:55 - and inside of my components I will
525:57 - create a new file new component and
525:59 - it'll be called header JS okay and I'm
526:02 - going to do import react from react like
526:06 - that I'm going to do import link from
526:10 - because I'm going to need need that from
526:12 - react router Router Dom like so and then
526:17 - let's also do import style from
526:20 - style dot header dot module.css they're
526:24 - going to be like hey guys see that file
526:25 - doesn't exist and you're right it
526:27 - doesn't exist and we're gonna run into a
526:29 - problem so inside of our style we're
526:31 - going to create a new file and it's
526:33 - going to be called header dot
526:37 - module.css okay let's just look at the
526:41 - style slash okay let's go style slash
526:45 - um and that should be good okay so I'm
526:48 - pretty sure that should be good okay
526:50 - cool so now let's um work on this
526:54 - component okay so there's going to be a
526:55 - lot of things that we're going to be
526:57 - doing so all function header like so and
527:01 - I'm going to just do return okay we're
527:04 - gonna have a div and the class name of
527:07 - this div is going to be style dot header
527:10 - all right and again we're going to
527:12 - create all these Styles so don't worry
527:14 - they're gonna not be there yet and then
527:16 - we'll have um link tag okay and this
527:19 - LinkedIn tag will be will have an exact
527:22 - two slash Explorer so when you click it
527:25 - it'll take you to the Explorer page and
527:27 - inside of here I'm going to have an
527:29 - image and that's going to be search dot
527:32 - PNG now before we continue further let's
527:35 - make sure at least this shows up so what
527:37 - do we need to do well we need to go to
527:39 - our home JS and we need to replace all
527:43 - this garbage that we have and replace it
527:45 - with our header component so I'm going
527:47 - to do header hit enter and it should
527:50 - import your header from there okay so
527:53 - now our header is being imported but we
527:55 - don't see anything so let's see and
527:58 - investigate further what could be going
528:01 - on let me remove this div and see what
528:03 - happens still I don't see anything maybe
528:06 - it's the styling of the image so let's
528:09 - go and take a look at that so actually
528:11 - you know of course we don't have this
528:14 - image I don't know like this is what
528:15 - happens when you um sit here in front of
528:17 - a computer for six hours straight and
528:19 - and working on this freaking project and
528:22 - coding you um you know start losing your
528:24 - brain cells so let's get back into it
528:27 - okay and we need to basically add um
528:30 - this you know this PNG file that um we
528:34 - don't have and then I'm pretending to
528:36 - have so let's go in our images and let's
528:40 - grab search because we're gonna need
528:42 - this okay we're also going to need a
528:45 - couple of other ones so we might as well
528:47 - just grab it now so we're gonna need
528:49 - search we're going to need notifications
528:51 - we're going to need invite we're gonna
528:54 - need calendar and we're going to need B1
528:57 - so let's go and drag all of these into
529:02 - our images folder great so now we're
529:04 - going to have access to all of those
529:06 - okay and let's hit refresh and there we
529:08 - go Tada or nice image that perfectly
529:12 - fits on the screen and looks completely
529:14 - mobile responsive there you go you're
529:15 - done congratulations on your build you
529:17 - can go home now
529:19 - okay let's work on it now cool so
529:23 - um uh let's let's of course style it a
529:27 - little bit because uh if I don't style
529:29 - this I'm gonna get a headache all right
529:31 - if we continue building this so let's go
529:33 - ahead and grab our header and uh display
529:35 - Flex Flex like that we'll go align items
529:39 - Center so this will align items
529:42 - vertically aligns things okay let's go
529:45 - back style dot header import style from
529:49 - okay and this is our header okay great
529:52 - and then
529:53 - um let's uh let's take the images first
529:57 - okay let's do that header let's take the
529:59 - image and we will go with 25 pixels okay
530:03 - let's hit refresh so there you go that
530:07 - is looking great right that looks good
530:09 - we can see it and we like it okay that's
530:12 - the size that we want otherwise it gets
530:14 - too crazy and then um we're also going
530:16 - to work on the nav items in just a
530:18 - second but right now let's let's go
530:20 - ahead and keep adding things to this
530:22 - okay let's throw in some more images
530:24 - first so then we can really see the
530:26 - difference of The Styling because I
530:28 - don't like to just add styling for the
530:30 - sake of adding styling let's go to home
530:32 - and uh we'll just wrap this up in some
530:34 - jsx fragments like this cool okay that's
530:38 - not really going to make any difference
530:39 - but just you know it makes me feel warm
530:41 - and cozy so just do it for me cool uh
530:44 - let's go to our header now and uh we'll
530:46 - add a couple of more links okay so let's
530:49 - get out of uh this div or actually let's
530:53 - let's stay in this div and let's just go
530:55 - down underneath this link and I'm gonna
530:58 - go div and we will create a new div for
531:01 - our nav items okay so inside of our nav
531:05 - items let's have a link exact two and
531:10 - this will be for friends invite okay and
531:15 - inside of this link we will have an
531:16 - image and uh this image will will be our
531:21 - invite image so there you go we got that
531:24 - okay and if I click between these you
531:26 - notice how the URL will change when I
531:29 - click the mail icon click it and it is
531:31 - navigating me right there okay where I
531:34 - asked it to navigate me now we're gonna
531:36 - need a couple more icons to be exact
531:38 - we're going to need calendar and
531:41 - notification and our profile image so
531:44 - we're gonna need three more so I'm gonna
531:45 - copy this I'm gonna go here and I'm
531:47 - going to hit paste and I'm going to hit
531:49 - paste and then I'm going to hit paste
531:51 - again okay so I copied it and pasted it
531:54 - three more times so we're gonna have a
531:56 - total of four inside of our nav bar now
531:59 - we need to change a few things so where
532:01 - it says slash friends invite we're going
532:04 - to change this with upcoming we're going
532:06 - to change this one with activity and
532:09 - this one will be profile okay and then
532:12 - this one here where it says upcoming I'm
532:14 - gonna change that to calendar the
532:17 - Activity one we're going to change this
532:19 - with the notification image so you see
532:22 - the images are changing so if you keep
532:24 - noticing what's going to happen with the
532:26 - last image when I change it from invite
532:28 - to B1
532:29 - so pretty much all the images and icons
532:33 - we need are there are the calendars and
532:36 - one two three four five yep one two
532:39 - three four five okay great so yeah
532:42 - they're all there so now this header is
532:44 - looking good but of course we need to
532:46 - finish our styling that we started
532:49 - justify content and we're going to do
532:52 - space between and you're going to see
532:54 - there's going to be a beautiful
532:55 - difference that happens and there you go
532:57 - and the space between is not happening
532:59 - between each element it's actually
533:01 - happening between our header and then
533:05 - our nav items okay and in between we
533:08 - have space and that's happening because
533:10 - of this and that's activated because of
533:13 - display Flex all right you see how all
533:15 - of this is connected it is freaking
533:17 - mind-blowing okay and I hope it's
533:20 - blowing your mind right now let's go
533:22 - padding 0.5 am and we'll go 1 em on this
533:27 - beautiful position I'm gonna go absolute
533:30 - okay that looks great we'll go top zero
533:34 - uh left zero and bottom zero and uh
533:39 - actually right zero and then that's good
533:41 - cool and then the background color will
533:44 - be the
533:46 - um of course the clubhouse color cool so
533:49 - that looks really really good and now
533:51 - we're going to
533:53 - um take care of our nav items and give
533:55 - them some margin because they look way
533:57 - too close to me squeezed up together so
534:00 - let's actually grab nav items image tags
534:03 - okay and then we'll go margin and let's
534:05 - give some margin between them let's go
534:07 - like this and now we got
534:10 - um some margin between them they look
534:12 - like they have some breathing room and
534:14 - that makes us happy okay so they're
534:17 - looking good so far and or pretty much
534:20 - good to good to keep going and go
534:23 - forward and actually uh work on more
534:26 - things so let's go all right so so far
534:28 - so good now we're gonna start adding our
534:31 - uh daily info cards okay and what these
534:35 - cards are are these cards right here
534:37 - okay so let's start adding those cards
534:39 - in the mix and uh and start working on
534:43 - them so we of course first of all need
534:46 - some data okay because we can't just
534:48 - make cards about nothing so let's go
534:50 - ahead and add some data okay so in my
534:53 - source I'm going to create a new folder
534:55 - it's going to be called data and inside
534:57 - of data I will have a new file and I'm
534:59 - going to call it
535:01 - dailycard.json this is we're going to
535:03 - pull our information from cool so we're
535:07 - gonna have an array of objects hello
535:10 - Json and in here I'm gonna have time and
535:15 - my time is going to be
535:17 - um time is going to be 7 PM okay and
535:22 - we'll try to give you this file too but
535:24 - just to kind of speed up the process
535:25 - here I'm going to um I'm going to just
535:28 - paste this okay so that will speed up
535:31 - the process a little bit so Time title
535:33 - description Time title so again boom
535:37 - Clubhouse Town Hall what is the
535:39 - connection between and talk let's do
535:41 - more okay so that's just us adding data
535:44 - so it didn't really add these cards yet
535:46 - okay so we actually need to make that
535:48 - happen now the next thing we need to do
535:50 - is actually be able to um to have a
535:54 - component that actually shows this so
535:58 - let's go on ahead to um let's go inside
536:03 - of our components and in our components
536:05 - we're going to create a new file and
536:07 - it's going to be called daily info
536:09 - card.js it's going to be our component
536:11 - okay and I'm going to do import react
536:14 - from react import style from I'm going
536:18 - to do Style slash daily
536:23 - infocard.module.css so again that is not
536:26 - done yet we're gonna actually create
536:27 - that styling and of course let's also do
536:30 - import data from we do data slash daily
536:34 - uh card.json okay so this is going to
536:37 - give us access to all of the data that
536:41 - we have now let's export this export
536:43 - default function daily info card like
536:47 - this and I'm going to return and um and
536:51 - let's go H2 and we'll say I'm the daily
536:55 - card like this let's hit save and we
536:58 - need to make sure that this is actually
537:00 - showing up so let's go to
537:02 - home.js and in home we'll add this
537:05 - component so I'm going to Simply say
537:08 - daily info card actually let's go daily
537:11 - info card and hit enter and it will Auto
537:15 - Import this component from the top okay
537:18 - let's hit refresh okay what's the error
537:20 - can't resolve okay so why it can't
537:23 - resolve is we need to actually create a
537:24 - styling so let's go inside of our
537:26 - styling and we'll create a new file and
537:28 - it will be called daily info card dot
537:32 - module dot CSS so that's going to take
537:36 - care of that and you should be up and
537:39 - running now the only thing is well why
537:42 - are we actually not seeing anything from
537:43 - here so let's go ahead and figure that
537:47 - out okay so now you might be wondering
537:49 - hey the H2 here is not showing up
537:52 - because that's what I was wondering and
537:54 - all we have to do to actually fix that
537:56 - is actually let's go ahead and create a
537:59 - new file in our style and this file will
538:02 - be called because what we need to do is
538:03 - push that down it's actually getting
538:05 - hidden behind Okay so we're going to
538:06 - create a new file and this file will be
538:08 - called
538:09 - home.module that's CSS okay and I'm
538:13 - going to dot home container and let's
538:16 - leave it empty for just one second
538:19 - let's go back to home and we are going
538:23 - to wrap this daily card info in a class
538:27 - and this class will be class name equals
538:30 - style dot whoops let's do
538:33 - um style dot home container like that
538:37 - and uh this card will be wrapped in this
538:40 - div and now let's go back wait why does
538:43 - this say style is not defined
538:46 - um oh yeah we have to actually import
538:48 - style from
538:51 - style.home wait slash home dot
538:54 - module.css like that
538:56 - okay now we need to actually add some
539:01 - styling to our home container okay so
539:04 - we're gonna do padding top and we'll do
539:07 - 3.5 em like that we will do
539:11 - overflow Auto let's also do padding left
539:15 - one em all right so the reason why
539:18 - that's not showing up is because this
539:20 - daily here is lowercase and it actually
539:22 - needs to be Capital because it was
539:24 - saying that it was not used so I was
539:25 - like interesting so let's make that
539:28 - capitalized and now okay that padding is
539:31 - actually helping right if I remove this
539:33 - padding notice you actually won't see it
539:35 - so let's add that padding beautiful and
539:38 - now we can see it okay now let's add
539:39 - some padding right we'll go one em on
539:42 - this okay let's go padding uh bottom
539:45 - we'll go 3.5 em okay so there's padding
539:49 - at the bottom it that'll help push out
539:51 - other things that are too close to it
539:53 - we'll go height 100 percent
539:57 - um and Yep this is looking good so the
540:00 - home container now looks good let's go
540:03 - to daily info card okay and let's see if
540:06 - we can console log things right so let's
540:08 - go and console log and see what data
540:11 - gives us this is the data that we're
540:12 - actually pulling from here so I'm going
540:15 - to hit inspect and uh we're gonna go to
540:18 - console and I haven't array and that
540:20 - array has all my stuff in it right so
540:23 - I'm already getting access so it's like
540:24 - if I want to get access to 7 pm time or
540:27 - let's see if I want to get access to
540:29 - where the title is Mind Body game how do
540:32 - I do that so I'll get my first index and
540:34 - then I will go uh give me my title right
540:38 - so if I did that save I now I'm seeing
540:41 - Mind Body game okay if I wanted access
540:44 - to this dynamically inside of my H2 I
540:47 - could actually do that as well just add
540:49 - this some jsx magic hit save and Mind
540:52 - Body gamma showing up here right if I
540:54 - show replace this with one now you'll
540:56 - have that one if I replace this with two
540:58 - so you're getting the pattern here right
541:00 - I'm probably gonna write a for Loop okay
541:03 - and that for Loop is probably gonna show
541:06 - as many items as there are in my Json
541:09 - okay got it cool so now let's just now
541:15 - ain't nothing to it but to do it so
541:18 - let's go ahead and uh do that so in my
541:21 - components let's start working on it
541:23 - let's remove this return here okay let's
541:26 - make it an expression and then inside of
541:29 - here I'm going to have my div I'll have
541:30 - class name equals all right we'll go
541:33 - style dot daily card so this dialing we
541:36 - will create it's not there yet okay so
541:39 - refresh it should be good okay and
541:43 - inside of here is we're going we're
541:46 - where we're going to do our looping okay
541:50 - so let's go data.map so whenever you're
541:53 - looping the dot map is going to come to
541:55 - save the day we get access to that item
541:58 - let's create another div inside of this
542:00 - div we'll have span class name we'll
542:03 - leave this blank okay and then we're
542:06 - gonna go item dot time it says item is
542:10 - declared but its value is never red so
542:14 - we're okay oh maybe these are maybe
542:17 - let's put squigglies right because as
542:20 - okay there you go all right so it's
542:23 - still not showing up but we'll have to
542:25 - do a couple of things for it to actually
542:26 - show up so let's see what we need to do
542:28 - let's go to our all right so now one
542:32 - another thing we want to do is make sure
542:34 - that this is actually returning uh right
542:36 - away so we're gonna do an implicit
542:38 - return and how we do that is simply
542:40 - because this lacks a return statement
542:43 - right so if I had a return statement
542:44 - like this here
542:46 - um you'll notice that it just works and
542:48 - I'm pulling all the information that I
542:51 - need okay but what we're going to do is
542:53 - I'm going to delete this and this and
542:55 - we're going to remove the squiggly and
542:57 - the squiggly and instead we're just
542:58 - going to replace it with a open close
543:01 - paren like this okay and then another
543:04 - one and we're good okay so now it's just
543:06 - returning this all right implicit return
543:09 - here and boom
543:12 - all right guys so now let's go ahead and
543:16 - uh what I'm gonna do is uh right
543:18 - underneath this span let's make another
543:21 - dip and inside of here we'll make a span
543:23 - tag and we'll say class name leave it
543:26 - empty okay and um actually let's not do
543:30 - that
543:31 - um I think let's do it another way so
543:34 - div we'll go span I'm sorry I'm just
543:37 - changing my mind here uh like crazy guys
543:40 - but just hang in there with me I think
543:42 - we should be fine with I think but this
543:44 - way how I had it and um I think I want
543:46 - to do item dot title now because I want
543:49 - to get the title so 7 PM Mind Body game
543:53 - Clubhouse town hall and ism.earth so so
543:55 - that's good and underneath this let's go
543:58 - P tag and let's grab the description now
544:02 - there we go so now we got all of them
544:04 - but what we need to do is make the title
544:07 - look a little bit smaller and gray make
544:12 - the description probably
544:14 - um bigger and dark okay and then we'll
544:18 - add this
544:19 - um background color okay probably add a
544:22 - little border radius and uh that seems
544:26 - pretty good right and then maybe some
544:27 - more things but that seems like a good
544:29 - start so those are the things I'm
544:31 - keeping in mind as I'm gonna go and um
544:34 - create the front end for this so let's
544:36 - go into our daily card uh daily info
544:40 - card module that's CSS and we'll grab
544:43 - this class let's go let's of course add
544:46 - our background color first we'll do E7
544:49 - E4 D5 just save okay background color is
544:54 - uh showing up actually is it showing up
544:57 - let's go FFF like this and hit refresh
545:01 - okay again I don't know why I wrote
545:03 - daily let's actually write daily card
545:05 - there we go okay now it's showing up so
545:08 - now let's change this 2 E7 e
545:13 - 4d5 okay just like this so now that
545:17 - color is there beautiful all right so we
545:20 - added the background so that's good okay
545:22 - let's add padding to it so it right
545:25 - because right now it's too close to the
545:27 - seven and you know the time and the
545:29 - title and the descriptions too close to
545:31 - them so we'll add some padding and
545:33 - that'll like boom right it makes it
545:36 - gives us some space and makes it bigger
545:39 - and then the last thing is let's add
545:41 - some border radius to it and that gives
545:44 - it those nice little rounded Corners
545:46 - okay what what's next let's um let's add
545:51 - our daily card and Target the div so
545:54 - we're gonna actually work on the div
545:55 - let's go uh display uh flex and again
546:00 - the reason why we're using this little
546:01 - greater than sign that you see here is
546:03 - because we don't want to select all of
546:06 - the children right if I did this it'll
546:08 - select all the divs within the divs
546:09 - within in the days within spans that
546:12 - have divs inside of them whatever right
546:14 - by doing this greater than sign I
546:16 - basically say hey buddy only get let's
546:21 - say like this div don't grab this div
546:24 - okay just the child of this card that's
546:28 - it okay the direct the direct child not
546:32 - my grandchild and great grandchild and
546:34 - great great great great grandchild okay
546:36 - so use that for your advantage but just
546:40 - remember with great power comes great
546:41 - responsibility and we'll go flex start
546:44 - on this cool and then um I'm gonna give
546:47 - margin bottom and we'll go 0.5
546:50 - okie dokie okie dokie so now you see
546:55 - there's like weird stuff going on with
546:57 - it but it's all good okay that's what uh
547:01 - I think adding display Flex did that
547:03 - right so if I remove display Flex this
547:05 - is how or if I add display Flex right
547:07 - this is how it's looking so we're still
547:09 - gonna need to style it a little bit more
547:11 - and then make it work okay let's uh let
547:14 - me actually zoom out a little bit so if
547:16 - I zoom out it looks better and this is
547:19 - realistically this is probably have a
547:21 - look on a phone but I'm just zoomed in
547:23 - more guys because I am on a giant TV so
547:27 - to you when I zoom out things look
547:29 - really really small right so for you the
547:31 - viewer I'm zooming in a little bit okay
547:34 - so just forgive me for some of the
547:36 - things when they don't look right let's
547:37 - grab our daily card let's grab a div
547:39 - within it and let's grab a span within
547:43 - that okay and we'll go with 20 and then
547:46 - let's also go text aligned and I'm gonna
547:50 - say end set refresh so you see this this
547:54 - went to the right like this let's grab
547:56 - our daily card again let's grab the div
547:58 - within it and the div within that okay
548:01 - and uh I want to style it is I want to
548:04 - go margin left 0.5 em okay so now
548:08 - there's a gap between seven uh the the
548:11 - time and the title in the description
548:13 - okay we'll go display Flex cool we'll go
548:17 - flex Direction and let's go column okay
548:21 - and with 80 percent great so that looks
548:26 - good and um I'm gonna just add a couple
548:28 - of more things so I'm gonna grab my
548:30 - daily card class again and I want to
548:32 - Target to span all the span tags inside
548:35 - of it okay and basically I want to say
548:38 - hey font size of this give me
548:43 - 0.675 em actually yeah that should be
548:46 - good so there we go we got the smaller
548:49 - font size just like kind of how we want
548:51 - it right we're gonna go color are in
548:54 - here and I'm gonna go hey give me a text
548:57 - give me my text color okay so this is
549:00 - more of that um Clubhouse color and then
549:03 - font weight I'm gonna go 500 on this bad
549:07 - boy okay so just adds a little bit more
549:09 - weight than the default now I definitely
549:12 - want to play with my uh that sounds
549:15 - funny now I definitely want to play with
549:18 - my P tag okay and uh we're gonna give it
549:21 - a font size
549:23 - of 0.875 em and let's go ahead and uh
549:28 - refresh this my boy Frankie's in the
549:30 - house let's go shout out to boy Frankie
549:33 - there we go
549:37 - hey hey if you made it so far to the
549:40 - video just say Frankie in the comments
549:42 - and nobody will know what the
549:43 - you're talking about it'll be the most
549:45 - upvoted comment it'll confuse the
549:46 - out of people but you're the squad
549:48 - you're the notification Squad so if I
549:50 - can do it hey all right let's um go here
549:53 - and I'm gonna give it a font weight of
549:57 - 500 okay again you see that pop out just
550:00 - a little bit and become darker and man
550:03 - starting to look good I'm gonna give it
550:05 - a line height Hamid is excited too nice
550:08 - uh line height okay so now the line
550:12 - height actually made it come closer to
550:14 - each other so it actually decreased the
550:16 - default that would that that it had I'm
550:19 - going to give it a margin of zero so
550:21 - let's see what that did right so here's
550:23 - a slow-mo replay boom take away that
550:25 - margin and it's much closer together
550:27 - okay
550:29 - um and I'm gonna go inline block cool
550:31 - and
550:33 - um inline block what else do we got okay
550:36 - white space gonna give it a no wrap on
550:39 - this thing so this is useful for in this
550:41 - case it's not going to be too much
550:42 - useful but this line here is useful for
550:45 - like if this screen became too small and
550:48 - one of these words had to be broken down
550:49 - it'll wrap it to the next line okay
550:52 - instead of like running across the
550:54 - screen and having you scrolling left and
550:56 - right but here it's not that necessary
550:57 - all right and then um let's go of course
550:59 - overflow I'm gonna go overflow hidden
551:03 - okay and we'll make that uh important
551:05 - all right and then basically what we're
551:07 - gonna do is I'm going to say text
551:09 - overflow okay and uh we'll do ellipses
551:13 - okay so if the text ever becomes too
551:16 - much I just kind of want it to uh give
551:18 - me an ellipsis so let's actually see if
551:20 - it does anything so I'll make the
551:22 - description much longer let's see if
551:25 - that does anything wow look at that so
551:27 - as soon as it starts overflowing look at
551:29 - that from the front end we can actually
551:31 - put the dot dot dots how freaking cool
551:33 - is that normally you have to do that
551:36 - from the back end right some a dummy
551:38 - like me that doesn't understand front
551:39 - end that much I would normally not do
551:42 - this but it's cool like I'm learning
551:43 - these new features with you okay we're
551:46 - both learning together so it's exciting
551:49 - um so that's actually a really cool
551:51 - thing to be able to do okay so that's
551:53 - your text overflow Ellipsis little ninja
551:56 - hack and then we'll go with
551:59 - um and we'll go 195 pixels okay so that
552:03 - made the width a little bit smaller and
552:05 - therefore the text starts to get the
552:08 - ellipses a lot earlier okay so our
552:11 - home.js is looking good our daily card
552:14 - Json is looking good our daily info card
552:17 - component is looking good our module
552:19 - files are looking good uh so this is
552:22 - good now we're gonna create a room info
552:24 - cards with dummy data okay so we're
552:27 - gonna have room cards now and they're
552:29 - going to have a bunch of information in
552:32 - them so let's go and start adding some
552:36 - uh Json files okay so let's go in our
552:40 - data I'll click file we'll go room card
552:44 - dot Json just like that okay and then
552:48 - room card we'll have boom boom okay and
552:52 - um basically we'll um I'm gonna copy
552:55 - some of this okay because it's gonna
552:58 - take too long to um to hand write this
553:01 - okay and we'll try to give you access to
553:04 - these files too so you can actually uh
553:06 - copy this and add this all right and
553:10 - then um starting from my members I'm
553:13 - going to copy that as well so let's go
553:16 - here and paste that cool and then I'm
553:21 - going to get a couple of more members
553:24 - and uh basically you know complete
553:27 - complete all of my data in here so I got
553:30 - all all of my stuff that completes my
553:33 - entire Json file okay you will just have
553:35 - this out of the box so I got a couple of
553:36 - members here okay so for example what am
553:39 - I trying to do right now so all this
553:40 - stuff here good time we got Calvin
553:42 - Harris right and then we got sriram
553:45 - Christian arthi we got Steven sanovski
553:48 - we got Paul Davidson that data is going
553:50 - to start to be pulled from here right
553:52 - now in our app it's not being pulled
553:54 - from anywhere yet okay so we are going
553:56 - to work on that so let's go to our
554:00 - components let's create a new file and
554:03 - we're going to call this file room info
554:06 - card.js all right and now we're gonna do
554:09 - the use we got our import react from and
554:14 - later we're gonna need these okay even
554:16 - though right now we might not need this
554:17 - but later we're gonna need to you use
554:20 - State and we're going to need react
554:22 - hooks so we're going to need a use
554:23 - effect so let's go from react and then
554:26 - I'm also going to do import style all
554:29 - right from and I'll go style
554:33 - roomcard.module.css like so and I'll
554:36 - also go import data from from data slash
554:39 - roomcard.json okay those are the three
554:42 - things I need access to and now I'm
554:43 - going to do export default function so
554:45 - basically the component that I need room
554:48 - info card it'll take in props and let's
554:51 - open it up and I'll just say return and
554:54 - um I'm just gonna have it return and
554:57 - empty jsx fragment for now actually
555:00 - let's uh let's add an H2 and say I am
555:04 - the room info card so now what I want to
555:07 - do is I'm going to connect this to my
555:09 - home so I can actually just see this
555:11 - file so let's go to our home JS and in
555:14 - my home
555:15 - I'm going to do a couple of things I'm
555:17 - going to add this component right
555:20 - underneath daily info card so I'm going
555:22 - to say room info card and hit enter
555:24 - that's going to Auto Import it at the
555:27 - top and then I'm going to say set items
555:31 - visible equals okay and you'll see what
555:35 - I do here and it's going to be
555:37 - um basically some of these items so
555:40 - actually we're just going to leave it as
555:43 - is I'm not gonna add any kind of extra
555:45 - fanciness to this just to kind of like
555:47 - reduce the scope of the project
555:48 - otherwise it would just take too
555:50 - freaking long okay so I'm gonna make it
555:52 - a little bit simpler so you can have it
555:54 - on your portfolio much faster okay now
555:57 - I'm importing it I'm showing it here now
555:59 - it's complaining hey you don't have the
556:00 - styling for it okay great let's add a
556:02 - new file it'll be called
556:05 - roomcard.module.css and that's it and
556:08 - hit refresh and now this says hey I am
556:11 - the room info card so we got this thing
556:14 - connect did and doing what we wanted to
556:17 - do and now if I wanted to like Loop
556:19 - through it and print this stuff out I
556:21 - could right and then I would basically
556:24 - have access to all of the things that I
556:26 - need right so like for example I could
556:28 - just do data.map I can grab um each item
556:33 - Loop through them and let's do my let's
556:36 - do implicit return here okay and we can
556:40 - basically say what we want here right so
556:43 - here let's just get our item so you're
556:46 - gonna complain all right so let me
556:49 - actually do
556:50 - json.stringify because it doesn't like
556:52 - when I do it the other way so there we
556:55 - go I'm just like splatting my entire
556:57 - object onto the screen if I needed
557:00 - access to like particular things from it
557:03 - I could get access to them right but
557:05 - what I imagine this is is probably we
557:07 - have an array of objects here right and
557:09 - I can Loop through them and get access
557:11 - to them and show the people and blah
557:14 - blah blah it's just a Json file okay but
557:16 - Json stringify is kind of a nice way to
557:19 - just Splat things onto the screen and
557:21 - see them all in one place Okay cool so
557:24 - let's now remove this stringify thing
557:26 - that we're doing here and instead what
557:29 - I'm going to do is um I'm going to let's
557:32 - open this up and let's go
557:34 - um let's open this up and what the
557:36 - that's not what I meant to do at all
557:38 - what is happening okay that's beautiful
557:40 - boom all right now inside of here I'm
557:43 - going to have a div inside of which I'm
557:46 - going to have another div inside of
557:47 - which I'm going to have another div okay
557:50 - is it mysterious enough how many more
557:52 - divs I'm going to have you don't know
557:54 - and then I'm just going to do style dot
557:56 - room card container and within this
558:00 - let's go and add an H6 I'm gonna say hey
558:03 - give me my item.title and then within
558:07 - this let's go H2 so I'll go H2 here
558:10 - actually let me practice that shortcut
558:12 - let's go H2 just like this command and D
558:15 - okay I'm going to do command D it
558:17 - selects I delete it deletes both save
558:19 - boom okay so now I'm getting access to
558:22 - my titles and here I'm gonna get access
558:25 - to my subtitle okay so title subtitle
558:29 - still doesn't look as beautiful as I
558:31 - wanted to but uh that's gonna happen
558:34 - very very soon okay the speed that we're
558:36 - going is going to happen very very soon
558:38 - so let's go to our module file so
558:42 - roomcard.module.css and now all we got
558:43 - to do is just add some some styling okay
558:47 - so let's go and go room card container
558:51 - and I'm going to give it a background
558:54 - color and we'll make it white save and
558:57 - you can see that white happening let's
558:59 - give it a padding of one em one Em which
559:03 - way cool now we're going to give it a
559:06 - border radius of 1 am cool so now we got
559:10 - a slightly rounded Corners let's go
559:12 - border none okay so now it looks cleaner
559:14 - and then we're going to go margin top
559:17 - 0.5 em so each of the cards has some
559:19 - spacing in between it beautiful now
559:22 - let's target the H6 and style that so
559:25 - I'm going to say font size
559:30 - 0.67575 em save so now that good time
559:34 - font became a lot smaller I'm going to
559:36 - give it a color of our text color like
559:39 - so and font weight will go 500 okay then
559:45 - let's grab the room container of H2 font
559:47 - size I'm going to go
559:50 - 0.875 em okay so now that text is a lot
559:54 - more contained it's not as crazy font
559:56 - weight that and now I'm gonna go line
559:59 - height one okay so that reduces the uh
560:03 - the line height that they had and then
560:06 - for color we're gonna go like the
560:07 - straight up black right so let's just go
560:09 - boom cool so it's like dark black
560:11 - perfect that's a room corn info is look
560:14 - looking good now we're making good
560:16 - progress let's keep going let's add
560:18 - let's do add details in the room info
560:22 - card okay so this is going to require a
560:25 - couple of things so first of all let's
560:27 - go ahead and let's do yarn add react
560:29 - icons and remember you will probably do
560:32 - npm install if you're not using yarn
560:34 - like me so yarn add react icons okay so
560:38 - now once that installation takes place
560:40 - it's going to be really good and I need
560:42 - access to a couple of images so I need
560:45 - access to this user image right here I
560:47 - also need access to this user image
560:49 - right here okay so these two images
560:52 - you're going to need so let's go ahead
560:54 - open our public have access to our
560:57 - images let's drag this drop it into our
560:59 - images and uh voila we have access to it
561:02 - okay beautiful then what we need is um
561:05 - we need to work on our room
561:08 - um room info card so let's go to our
561:11 - room info card not here room info card
561:14 - right there and let's work on it so
561:17 - react icons that we actually added has
561:20 - access to all of the icons that means it
561:23 - has access to font awesome and icons and
561:27 - the rest of the icons okay so that's why
561:29 - it's super
561:30 - um useful to use that Library it also
561:33 - has access to material I a material UI
561:36 - icons and evil icons and feather icons
561:39 - so all the icons okay so installing
561:41 - react icons is a really nice hack that
561:44 - you can use okay so use that alright so
561:46 - now we're basically going to add some
561:49 - more details to the info card to make it
561:51 - look like this because we have the title
561:54 - we have the subtitle but we don't have
561:56 - the people's names showing we don't have
561:59 - how many people are in this room we you
562:02 - know there's like bunch of stuff that we
562:04 - don't have right we don't have images of
562:06 - the people showing like this
562:08 - um and we're also going to need icons
562:09 - like this chat icon this filled chat
562:13 - icon and this like person fill that
562:14 - content we're gonna need a couple of
562:15 - things here so let's start off by
562:18 - working on those things okay so we got
562:23 - the images that we needed now we just
562:25 - actually need to like start coding some
562:27 - of this up so inside our room info card
562:30 - uh let's go right underneath this H2
562:33 - right here and we're going to make
562:35 - another div and uh whoops and I'm going
562:39 - to give it a class name of style dot
562:42 - room members like so we are going to
562:46 - create styling for room members later
562:49 - for now let's just keep going so we got
562:52 - room members let's create another div
562:54 - inside and in this div I'm going to have
562:57 - my images okay and we're going to have
562:59 - user image.jpg and this one so that
563:03 - image is already showing up that's
563:04 - really really good and then this is
563:06 - going to be called user image 2. so we
563:09 - got both of the users but notice that it
563:12 - just keeps running across I can scroll
563:14 - horizontal I mean it's kind of hideous
563:16 - but it works so that's a really good
563:18 - sign and it's looping through so for
563:20 - however many cards we have we have that
563:23 - many uh images right so these two images
563:25 - showing up three times six images
563:26 - showing up currently cool all right so
563:30 - now what we need to do is uh let's go
563:33 - right underneath this div ending we'll
563:36 - create another div and uh inside of here
563:39 - let's Loop through we're going to do
563:41 - item Dot members.map and um remember
563:45 - we're already looping right here so we
563:47 - have access to item so then we're gonna
563:50 - map through each item each item's
563:53 - members
563:54 - and we're gonna do uh the following I'm
563:57 - gonna grab uh any item that's in there
563:59 - let's do this and uh we're gonna have it
564:03 - just returned an expression let's go
564:06 - inside of here and we'll do a P tag okay
564:10 - and then inside of there I'm going to do
564:13 - item DOT first name and followed by item
564:17 - so that person's first name and we'll do
564:19 - I mean it should just be called person
564:21 - right we could probably just call this
564:22 - person as well so we got first name and
564:25 - then we got last name like so and let's
564:28 - see if it's actually showing up anywhere
564:29 - so boom Surya Ram Krishan or the
564:32 - stevensonovsky Paul Davidson we have uh
564:36 - we have this working already and uh
564:38 - let's let's actually name it person
564:40 - unless we have a good reason not to okay
564:43 - now the code
564:44 - um easier to understand and then let's
564:46 - actually add a um
564:48 - let's add our icons okay so let's go all
564:53 - the way to the top and I'm going to do
564:54 - import and I'll say BS chat Dots bschat
565:00 - Dots fill and Bs fill person fill and
565:05 - we'll do from react icon slash BS
565:10 - okay and if I scroll down oh what
565:14 - happened to my freaking oh yeah okay
565:15 - let's add it here we didn't add it
565:17 - that's why and all I'm gonna do is I'm
565:19 - going to say BS chat dots like this
565:24 - and now we got the person next uh and
565:27 - next to the person we have the chat dots
565:29 - okay so that looks great that looks
565:33 - really really good right underneath this
565:35 - we're going to have AP tag this is going
565:38 - to have its class name and we're going
565:40 - to do uh display Flex align items and
565:44 - I'm going to do Center and then inside
565:47 - of it now inside of this P tag we'll
565:50 - write We'll add a span tag and this will
565:53 - have a class name of MR2 okay so margin
565:57 - right we're going to give it some margin
566:00 - right and uh let's just write 1.8
566:03 - beautiful it's there now and right
566:05 - underneath that let's go BS fill person
566:08 - fill so we can have that icon right next
566:11 - to that okay and then I'll go span and
566:15 - we'll go class name let's do MX2
566:19 - um and we'll just leave it blank for now
566:22 - okay or empty like basically giving a
566:25 - space right after the span let's have
566:27 - another span here and we'll go class
566:30 - name and again we'll go margin right too
566:33 - all right and uh just in case I didn't
566:36 - clarify what MX was MX is margin
566:38 - horizontal okay this is margin right
566:41 - cool so we'll go and let's just put the
566:46 - number like five here
566:47 - okay and then we'll go and basically do
566:51 - chat dots fill oh okie dokie that looks
566:56 - good so now this page is pretty much
566:58 - done now all we gotta do is uh work on
567:01 - The Styling so let's go into the room
567:03 - card
567:04 - module.css and let's finish up the
567:07 - styling that we started okay so let's go
567:11 - room members and we'll grab the image
567:15 - and first let's control the image
567:17 - because it's just out of control and
567:18 - it's like way too big there we go so now
567:22 - we got the images under control so
567:24 - that's good let's add the Border radius
567:27 - of 0.6 em okay so now already the images
567:32 - are looking really clean
567:35 - um it's so cool like I kind of just want
567:37 - to build an app for our own team now it
567:40 - this like inspires me and let's go like
567:43 - this room members and I'll go display
567:45 - flex and I'll go align items Flex start
567:49 - okay good cool let's go room members
567:54 - I'll grab the P tag and then we'll go
567:56 - font size
567:59 - 0.975 uh em
568:02 - okay let's refresh
568:05 - so now it's looking good we have the
568:07 - images to the left we got the text nice
568:10 - and Center just like this
568:12 - font weight I'll go 400
568:16 - and uh line height let's play with the
568:19 - line height
568:20 - so line height will shrink it okay we
568:22 - reduce the light height and we'll go
568:24 - margin bottom okay so We Shrunk the
568:28 - margin bottom too so now these cards are
568:30 - kind of getting squished together and
568:31 - coming closer okay and giving it that
568:34 - text color okay good and uh let's grab
568:39 - our room members class let's grab the
568:41 - div inside of it and let's grab the
568:43 - first child in that div okay and what
568:46 - we're going to do with this is I'm going
568:48 - to say hey make the position of this
568:51 - relative and give me a margin right of
568:54 - two yeah boom look at that if I take
568:58 - away the margin right right it makes it
569:02 - makes a huge difference so let's hit uh
569:04 - refresh save and refresh boom so now we
569:06 - got the images on the left we got this
569:08 - on the right now these cards are looking
569:10 - really freaking good right now we want
569:13 - to do a couple of more things and it'll
569:15 - make all of this look even better okay
569:18 - so let's go room members let's grab the
569:20 - div let's grab the first child again and
569:23 - then within that let's grab the image
569:25 - and then let's grab the second child
569:28 - like that and uh we'll basically go so
569:31 - this is the second image so this is
569:33 - really cool we're basically saying grab
569:36 - this div inside of that div right so
569:38 - wherever the div is inside of that div
569:40 - get me the image so that's like okay I'm
569:43 - getting you all the image tags and then
569:45 - we're like inside of the image tag get
569:47 - us the second image so like we don't
569:50 - care about this one specifically we want
569:52 - the second one and we're gonna go
569:54 - position absolute and then um we're
569:57 - going to go left one em
570:00 - and we'll go top one em just like this
570:04 - so hit save and look at that this image
570:08 - is now on top of that other image watch
570:11 - what happened when I removed the first
570:13 - child from being relative it has now
570:16 - gone up and it's doing position absolute
570:19 - against the entire browser right by
570:23 - doing this trick here by making the
570:25 - parent position relative then what
570:27 - happens is that the child even those
570:30 - position absolute it's only going to
570:31 - play instead of playing on this entire
570:34 - canvas and then it goes hey left one em
570:37 - and top one em is right there it goes we
570:40 - go actually that's not your parent
570:42 - anymore your parent is actually now just
570:47 - this container over here that contains
570:50 - the images and so then within that when
570:52 - we give it a position absolute and go
570:54 - left when em and top one em it goes
570:56 - right there you see it's kind of like a
570:58 - cool hack that you can do so yeah this

571:49 - beautiful
571:51 - um and let's just keep going okay so now
571:53 - uh what we want to do is let's add a
571:55 - button to start a room uh so like for
571:58 - example I'm talking about this button
571:59 - right here all right that green juicy
572:02 - button that's a starter room we're gonna
572:03 - add that because that's what our app
572:05 - needs right now so inside of my home JS
572:09 - okay let's go home Jess inside of here
572:13 - um we're gonna add this thing okay so
572:15 - all the way to the top let's go import
572:18 - and uh we're gonna we're going to do AI
572:21 - outline plus outline outline plus okay
572:27 - from react icon slash Ai and then we're
572:32 - gonna need another one and we're gonna
572:33 - go BS grid three by three yeah and let's
572:39 - go BS okay so what is this well here is
572:43 - the three by three grid icon and then
572:45 - here is the other icon that we're gonna
572:47 - need okay so yeah let's go we
572:50 - got this all right now
572:53 - um we're gonna go down into right
572:56 - underneath our room info card let's get
572:58 - out of this div let's create another div
573:00 - and uh within here I'm gonna go class
573:02 - name and we're gonna go style dot action
573:06 - underscore button and um let's give it
573:10 - let's give this a styling as well so
573:13 - I'll go style and we're going to give it
573:16 - a object so we're going to go position
573:20 - items actually let me think about this
573:23 - because we might not even need that we
573:26 - might we might be able to keep it simple
573:27 - all right so now what we're going to do
573:30 - is um let's go ahead and uh you know the
573:33 - main functionality we're going to start
573:34 - working on is the starter room and how
573:36 - it opens up these rooms and you can
573:38 - choose from different ones so we're
573:40 - gonna like kind of add that
573:42 - functionality so let's go we got this
573:45 - button this div right here now inside of
573:49 - here what I want to do is I want to
573:52 - create a button all right and then
573:55 - within this button what I want to do is
573:58 - um I want to have my outline plus
574:02 - outline plus okay not pick Center we
574:06 - don't need to import that okay great
574:08 - this icon I'm going to give it a margin
574:12 - right so let's just first add it so you
574:15 - can see it so right now this plus is all
574:18 - the way at the bottom left doesn't look
574:20 - very pretty but it um it's there okay
574:24 - let's give it a um class name and we'll
574:28 - do our bootstrap class so I'm going to
574:30 - go margin right two okay so now that
574:33 - made it that expanded it and made it a
574:35 - little bit bigger okay and then we're
574:38 - gonna say start or room like this so now
574:41 - we have a button that says starter room
574:43 - okay and then right underneath that
574:46 - we're actually going to have another
574:48 - button and this button is going to
574:51 - um say the following BS grid uh three by
574:56 - three Gap and let's end it like so and
575:00 - it says is not whoa whoa whoa what okay
575:03 - let's refresh react Dash icons is not
575:08 - exported attempted import error
575:10 - interesting okay let's try to do this BS
575:15 - grid three by three
575:17 - uh refresh okay so the error here guys
575:20 - is this I believe is a capital x so
575:23 - let's make it a capital x and save and
575:26 - that should be uh reference error three
575:29 - by three X is not defined okay cool now
575:32 - we got that grid icon showing up at the
575:35 - bottom okay beautiful so that's looking
575:37 - good and uh let's let's now start
575:41 - styling this okay because it looks way
575:43 - too ugly for us to just be able to
575:46 - ignore it and continue so I'm going to
575:49 - go on home container and then we're
575:51 - gonna go and get the action button all
575:54 - right so Pro tip this plus sign here
575:57 - basically means hey get me the sibling
575:59 - action button of Home container okay so
576:02 - they're at the same level so like if if
576:04 - I go in home.js or not home JS where
576:07 - should I go room info card okay if
576:09 - wherever we have home container is there
576:13 - a good example of this
576:15 - um let's look all right so basically
576:18 - here I'm saying hey uh get me the action
576:21 - button that's at the same level as this
576:24 - guy but say that this action button was
576:26 - nested inside here it would not get me
576:29 - that and if it was on the outside of
576:31 - this one layer back it would also not
576:33 - get me that so as long as they're at the
576:35 - same level it will get me that okay
576:37 - that's pretty freaking cool you can do
576:40 - that with that plus sign
576:42 - um little plus sign action here so I'm
576:44 - Gonna Get You The Sibling action button
576:46 - and inside of it any buttons I want to
576:48 - style them the following way so it's not
576:51 - child
576:52 - um it's sibling cool so now let's go and
576:57 - um let's give it a background color of
577:00 - uh transparent and then what we're going
577:03 - to do is border none that should make it
577:05 - look less ugly so you can see all the
577:08 - way at the bottom now it looks slightly
577:09 - less ugly and then we'll go margin left
577:13 - and we'll go Auto that should uh
577:16 - let's see does that do anything it
577:18 - doesn't do anything in this case not a
577:21 - problem let's go home container and uh
577:23 - we'll do the same thing again so action
577:26 - button like this and then let's do
577:29 - display flex and I'm gonna just do font
577:32 - size and we'll go 1.3 em like this now
577:35 - let's do home container and I'm gonna
577:38 - grab the sibling action button and um
577:42 - okay this display Flex actually I don't
577:44 - need but here we got our display Flex
577:47 - okay hold on I'm I'm doing something
577:50 - funny here okay so this home container
577:52 - here right what I want to select within
577:55 - this by the way is I want to actually
577:57 - select the button SVG all right now you
578:01 - can start to see that it's actually in
578:03 - the middle so that's cool so get me the
578:06 - button SVG and then in this one what I
578:09 - want to do is um I'm going to align item
578:12 - Center okay so I'm going to be
578:14 - vertically aligned I want to add padding
578:17 - okay so that was the thing that was
578:19 - missing and that's gonna actually make a
578:22 - big impact on how this looks so added
578:25 - padding and now you can see all the way
578:27 - at the bottom I got starter room with
578:29 - tons of padding but it's like just stuck
578:31 - to the bottom but that's not what I want
578:33 - I want it to be there like all the time
578:35 - okay so let's go down it's there and
578:37 - then it goes away
578:39 - so we're gonna fix that that's why we're
578:41 - gonna give it position absolute okay
578:44 - actually we can even do um position
578:46 - sticky all right so now it's just
578:49 - freaking stays
578:51 - it stays there the whole time
578:53 - um and now let's go position all right
578:57 - and now we're gonna go and do left zero
579:00 - and I'm gonna do
579:03 - um I'm gonna do uh right zero and then
579:06 - I'm going to do top zero and you can see
579:09 - it's vanished and then it comes back up
579:11 - okay let's refresh okay it's there it's
579:14 - there so that's good
579:15 - and we're going to give it a background
579:17 - image actually so let's go background
579:19 - image and I want to give it a linear
579:22 - gradient and it's going to be a
579:24 - transparent 20 percent we'll give it a
579:27 - certain uh the um the clubhouse color
579:30 - here and we'll give it 80 percent
579:33 - so
579:35 - yeah so it basically has a 20
579:38 - transparent to eighty percent Clubhouse
579:41 - colors okay going from top to bottom
579:43 - like that and now let's go home
579:46 - container let's grab the action button
579:48 - let's grab the button inside of that and
579:50 - then let's grab the first child what was
579:53 - that first child great
579:57 - and um let's start working on this now
580:00 - so I'm gonna go and say border radius to
580:04 - em okay let's go background color and
580:08 - let's give it this color it might be a
580:12 - green color let's see yep so we got this
580:16 - this green happening okay so we will
580:18 - still need to change the text color so
580:20 - let's go and make the text um all white
580:23 - okay good let's add padding actually to
580:27 - it so I'm gonna go like this for the
580:30 - padding beautiful looking much better
580:32 - and uh font size let's go like this
580:36 - beautiful font weight I'm going to give
580:39 - it a 400 all right okay and then uh
580:44 - display Flex
580:46 - align items I want to do vertically
580:49 - centered so that plus sign just got a
580:52 - little bit more centered it was not
580:53 - initially we're going to go and position
580:56 - absolute this bad boy and then left 50
581:01 - percent
581:03 - okay and then transform will do
581:06 - translate X
581:08 - by negative 50 percent okay so now
581:13 - whether I go up or down it's always
581:15 - there up or down boom always there okay
581:18 - beautiful so a starter room is there our
581:21 - other like little grid icon is there in
581:23 - the bottom right so this is looking
581:25 - really good and ignore that little thing
581:27 - that's my Chrome extension that it's
581:30 - just impossible to ever remove but we're
581:32 - making really good progress so far and
581:34 - then the last thing I want to do there's
581:37 - still a little bit more that we got to
581:38 - do here is um let's go to our home
581:42 - container uh sibling action button let's
581:45 - grab a button inside of that let's get
581:48 - its uh second child okay like this and
581:52 - then let's give it a line height of one
581:54 - all right and then let's go down and
581:57 - I'll do home container again let's get
581:59 - the sibling button let's get the um nth
582:04 - child and I'll basically get the um
582:07 - all right and same thing but this time
582:11 - let's play with the SVG and uh we'll go
582:14 - text color okay beautiful so now all of
582:19 - that is good it's looking like how we
582:21 - want it it looks beautiful and now we're
582:24 - basically ready to make progress and um
582:27 - continue further okay and we're gonna
582:29 - basically now add an animated bottom
582:32 - sheet so that when we click Start a room
582:34 - there's actually a bottom sheet that
582:36 - pops open look at how good it looks so
582:39 - let's go and do that so first things
582:41 - first let's open up our command line and
582:44 - um I'm gonna hit clear and let's install
582:46 - this thing so I'm going to do yarn add
582:48 - you have to do npm install if you're not
582:50 - using yarn okay so yarn add I'm going to
582:52 - do react swipe I'm gonna move my face so
582:56 - you can actually see it swipe able
582:59 - bottom sheet just like that
583:02 - and uh let's mirror my face it looks
583:05 - like I'm actually looking at the code so
583:07 - now it's installed we can put our
583:09 - command line away and uh now we can keep
583:12 - going at it all right so a couple of
583:15 - things right now okay that are happening
583:16 - that are like a little funny and our
583:19 - button doesn't really look that good
583:20 - okay so I'll show you what's happening
583:22 - okay notice on the right hand side we
583:25 - have two scroll bars right now so I can
583:27 - scroll within here and then I can scroll
583:30 - on the outside what the hell is going on
583:32 - that's really weird why is there like
583:34 - two different ways to scroll so we're
583:37 - gonna we're gonna do a couple of things
583:39 - one I want to do bottom zero all right
583:43 - and now this thing should show up cool
583:46 - so now I can scroll in here and it's
583:48 - there but then I can still scroll on the
583:50 - outside which is weird and it doesn't
583:53 - really create a good feel for the app
583:54 - that that's not what we want so let's go
583:57 - to app CSS and in this we don't want to
584:01 - be able to scroll app layout so let's go
584:04 - overflow hidden hit save
584:07 - and
584:09 - look at that it's done okay
584:12 - so it's beautiful the solution was
584:15 - really elegant and simple okay and our
584:18 - problem that we were facing is now fixed
584:20 - and we are good to go okay so let's now
584:23 - keep on going and making progress on
584:25 - this so next up all right so now let's
584:28 - go forward with adding the bottom sheet
584:31 - okay so we already did our installation
584:33 - just in case you missed it for whatever
584:35 - reason
584:36 - um just make sure you do yarn add let me
584:39 - hit up yarn add react swipeable bottom
584:41 - sheet okay because we're going to need
584:43 - that again that's this thing right here
584:46 - I'm going to hit command J and lower my
584:49 - command line there and let's actually
584:51 - add the code for bottom sheet and
584:53 - there's going to be a couple of things
584:54 - that we're going to need to do for this
584:55 - okay so this is going to take a second
584:56 - so let's close out of this go inside of
584:59 - our source inside of our components I'm
585:01 - going to create a new file and it's
585:03 - going to be called bottom sheet.js just
585:06 - like this okay and then we're going to
585:08 - do import react from react like that
585:12 - we'll do import swipeable bottom sheet
585:16 - from react swipeable bottom sheet we'll
585:21 - do import style from and it's going to
585:24 - complain that we don't have this yet so
585:25 - we're going to make this next bottom
585:27 - sheet
585:28 - module.css okay let's just make this
585:31 - file before it complains because it's
585:32 - really annoying when it does so let's go
585:34 - to style new file bottom
585:37 - sheet.module.css there let's come back
585:39 - to our file now and uh I'm gonna do
585:42 - export default function and this
585:46 - component will be called bottom sheet
585:48 - it'll take in props all right and then
585:51 - we'll do returned
585:53 - and we're going to do this okay
585:55 - swipeable bottom sheet and we'll say
585:58 - open okay and it'll take in the props
586:02 - dot sheet visible and then we'll do all
586:06 - right so um let's go on change and uh
586:10 - we'll go boom on change here's what I
586:14 - want you to do buddy I want you to go
586:16 - and do props dot um
586:19 - set sheet visible I'll do props dot
586:24 - sheet visible so basically when you
586:26 - click it just invert its visibility okay
586:30 - so for example when I click here so here
586:33 - it's like off right now the default
586:35 - state is off but when I click it it's on
586:37 - but then when I click it again it's off
586:40 - you see so like you need to be able to
586:43 - set it on and off on change okay and in
586:46 - this case the change is clicking in and
586:48 - moving it down okay so those are going
586:50 - to be the two things that are going to
586:51 - be inverting it and then I'm going to
586:53 - say browse set items visible and we're
586:57 - going to set that to true so far so good
587:01 - all right and then let's go full screen
587:06 - equals I'm going to go props.sheet title
587:10 - it's going to be room detail so if it's
587:14 - room detail then I want you to return
587:16 - true otherwise false and let's close
587:20 - that okay and then right underneath this
587:23 - I'm going to create a div that div is
587:25 - going to have a class name of style dot
587:29 - bottom uh let's go bottom sheet
587:33 - container just like this so that's good
587:37 - and then here we're going to give it a
587:39 - style
587:40 - and we're going to say background color
587:42 - back
587:44 - ground color will be props the sheet
587:48 - title profile okay if it is a profile
587:52 - then give me transparent parent
587:55 - otherwise give me empty okay and
588:00 - um that's it so now let's just close out
588:03 - of everything that we have opened export
588:06 - default function hit save and this will
588:10 - save so that's a lot we're gonna break
588:12 - it down don't worry but right now there
588:14 - is a lot that we got to do okay so let's
588:16 - like keep powering through this and then
588:18 - it's gonna make um it's gonna make sense
588:21 - once it's for pretty much done okay so
588:24 - let's go to our home and um in our home
588:27 - I'm going to go and import bottom sheet
588:30 - actually let's not do that because we'll
588:32 - just import it as we need
588:34 - uh import data from and we'll go data
588:37 - slash
588:38 - roomcard.json okay good and then let's
588:42 - go right underneath home and we're going
588:45 - to now use State finally
588:47 - okay because we need it in our home Js
588:53 - so let's go and import it from here use
588:58 - State beautiful go down here we're going
589:01 - to go const I'm going to say items
589:03 - visible
589:05 - set items visible and this is going to
589:09 - be true and then let's go and do um
589:14 - sheet visible and we'll go set sheet
589:17 - visible
589:19 - and we'll go
589:21 - false and we'll need to do a couple more
589:25 - okay so I'm going to go to this one and
589:27 - we're gonna go
589:28 - sheet create room this will be set sheet
589:33 - create room let's make another one
589:37 - that's loader visibility stability so
589:41 - like this is where we're going heavy on
589:43 - react here set loader visibility and
589:47 - then last one we're going to do card ID
589:50 - and I'm going to do Set Card ID okay and
589:55 - we're going to say you state one just
589:58 - like that all right now we're gonna go
590:00 - down and basically we're gonna say for
590:02 - the button on click I want you to do the
590:06 - following I want you to set sheet
590:10 - visible and set that to true and then
590:13 - we're going to add the bottom sheet and
590:15 - the bottom sheet we're actually going to
590:17 - add below the button and below this div
590:20 - ending and we're going to add a
590:23 - bottom sheet like this okay and if you
590:27 - Auto completed it it should import
590:28 - bottom sheet from the top just like that
590:30 - so we're going to go bottom sheet and
590:32 - I'm going to say sheet title is equal to
590:35 - start room we'll set
590:39 - um let's actually end the sheet it's
590:41 - going to be a self closing tag we'll do
590:44 - set sheet visible to
590:49 - we'll take an item and we'll go set
590:51 - sheet visible to item okay whatever the
590:54 - item we're passing in
590:56 - all right next up let's go sheet visible
590:58 - like this and we'll go sheet visible I'm
591:03 - going to go car detail and let's go
591:06 - let's go data dot find and let's do for
591:10 - every item that we get let's get the
591:13 - item ID
591:15 - okay and check if it's equal to the card
591:17 - ID then let's do set items visible okay
591:21 - and again we're gonna do we're gonna do
591:23 - item okay and I'm gonna go and say set
591:27 - items visible to the item and then let's
591:32 - do set sheet create uh create room just
591:37 - like this okay equals oh grab the item
591:41 - and then do the following
591:44 - set loader visibility to true and then
591:48 - we're gonna do set timeout set sheet
591:52 - create Rome okay give it item and then
591:56 - what I want to do lastly here is set
591:59 - loader visibility to false okay and then
592:02 - let's just give it a thousand second
592:06 - timeout okay or not second but
592:08 - millisecond cool so pretty much one
592:11 - second time out here so a lot going on
592:14 - here in bottom sheet but again just hang
592:16 - in with me
592:18 - um I promise it will make sense okay
592:21 - now let's hit save and refresh okay
592:26 - and um let's go to our app it says sheet
592:30 - visible is not defined inside of Home JS
592:34 - so sheet visible visible okay so let's
592:40 - correct that set items visible sheet set
592:44 - sheet trade room okay
592:46 - beautiful
592:48 - okay let's click so right now nothing is
592:51 - necessarily happening and then also
592:53 - let's go ahead to our styling
592:56 - um and add our styling to it all right
592:58 - so let's go to our let's basically add
593:01 - some CSS because without it we really
593:03 - won't see it so let's go to bottom sheet
593:06 - module CSS here okay and uh and by the
593:10 - way just at a high level just so I can
593:12 - explain what's happening here right when
593:13 - I hit start a room it opens up a bottom
593:15 - sheet right then I can select any one of
593:17 - these now when I click into one of them
593:19 - and I hit let's go it opens up yet
593:22 - another bottom sheet okay so the bottom
593:26 - sheet within the bottom sheet okay
593:27 - that's why it kind of gets like a little
593:29 - complex here okay and also notice if
593:33 - we're lucky you're going to see a loader
593:35 - in the middle unless it like loads too
593:37 - fast so let's let's go you see that you
593:40 - saw that right hopefully you saw that
593:41 - one click it I'm going to click and
593:44 - right there okay I'm sure you saw it so
593:47 - that loader is also are being added in
593:49 - the middle while it's loading so there's
593:50 - a lot going on in real time so let's go
593:53 - bottom
593:55 - sheet container
593:57 - let's go here
593:59 - um where are we adding this class name
594:01 - right there okay bottom sheet container
594:03 - and let's go background color and we'll
594:07 - go
594:08 - ffff and this is our code okay so so far
594:12 - nothing is happening all good let's
594:15 - click here and let's go border radius go
594:19 - 1.5 em let's go padding I'll go 1.5 am
594:22 - followed by 1 nem like this okay
594:25 - position let's go relative on this and
594:28 - let's go height uh a hundred oops a
594:32 - hundred percent okay let's hit so now we
594:36 - got this completely styled it's
594:38 - connected to our file and now let's
594:40 - troubleshoot what's happening oh and by
594:43 - the way I made this one typo hopefully
594:45 - you didn't make it with me so if you go
594:47 - to bottomsheet.js in components
594:51 - um I kept writing visible and so when
594:54 - you do that what happens is when you
594:55 - click right and you hit start room
594:57 - nothing happens but if this is visible
595:01 - right and then you click it and you hit
595:04 - start a room that will happen like a
595:05 - modal thing will try to open up okay
595:07 - even though right now it doesn't really
595:09 - look that good
595:10 - so now let's work on once we click Start
595:14 - a room we want to be able to
595:16 - um basically see something right so like
595:18 - for example when I start a room I see
595:20 - open social close things like that right
595:22 - so let's actually start adding certain
595:24 - things to it so
595:27 - um first things first let's make a new
595:29 - component so let's start there all right
595:32 - so in components what we're going to do
595:34 - is I'm going to right click
595:36 - um we have bottom sheets okay but
595:39 - basically inside of bottom sheets we're
595:41 - going to actually we're going to create
595:43 - a new folder okay and it's going to be
595:45 - called bottom sheets just like this dot
595:49 - J uh not DOT JS it's a freaking folder
595:51 - okay cool
595:54 - um and then in here I'm going to do
595:55 - start
595:57 - room.js just like that
595:59 - all right so we got bottom sheet um this
596:02 - component okay now let's work on it okay
596:04 - so I'm going to do import uh react and
596:07 - then we'll do use State just like this
596:10 - I'm going to go from react okay let's go
596:13 - import style from and let's go boom
596:18 - style bottom
596:20 - sheet.module.css and then I'm going to
596:23 - go import FC Globe because we're going
596:26 - to use those Globe um
596:29 - icons right in a little bit so from
596:32 - react icon slash FC those icons are
596:37 - going to be really cool once we add
596:39 - those that component is going to pop and
596:42 - it's going to look so freaking good okay
596:45 - so let's keep going and add that now
596:49 - let's go ahead and make our component
596:51 - and it's going to be called start room
596:54 - and it's going to take in some props all
596:56 - right
596:57 - and here we go and room set room okay
597:02 - and we'll go use State open just like
597:05 - that and then we're going to say return
597:08 - the following all right and let's close
597:12 - close that guy just kidding
597:15 - um I'm gonna close this jsx expression
597:17 - here and um fragment I mean all right
597:21 - and then in here I'm going to have a div
597:24 - with a class name of style dot switch
597:29 - underscore line let's go like this now
597:33 - within this div I'm going to have
597:36 - um actually no that div let's just end
597:38 - it there for now and then let's have
597:40 - another div all right and then we're
597:42 - gonna have a class name of uh let's
597:45 - let's do text right on this and we're
597:47 - going to add a button to this and I'm
597:50 - going to do style dot add topic button
597:53 - and we're going to create all these
597:55 - Styles so again don't worry so much
597:58 - about it right now plus add a topic okay
598:03 - just like that now we're going to need
598:06 - to connect this to our bottom sheet so
598:09 - let's just connect this to our bottom
598:12 - sheet for now okay so if I hit start a
598:13 - room right now nothing happens so let's
598:15 - go to our bottom sheet and let's import
598:19 - import start room
598:21 - from
598:23 - bottom sheets slash start room and then
598:26 - let's go down right underneath this
598:30 - um actually where it should be at this
598:31 - let's add it right underneath this I
598:34 - think actually so let's go right
598:35 - underneath here
598:37 - and let's do a couple of things all
598:40 - right so let's go inside of this div
598:42 - here okay not not inside here okay
598:46 - because that's where you add attributes
598:47 - so boom right there and uh what we're
598:51 - going to do okay is we're going to uh
598:54 - add our start room component which we
598:57 - imported from the top and it's going to
598:59 - be self-contained so let's just end it
599:01 - for now let's go set sheet create room
599:05 - equals and passive props.set sheet
599:09 - create row just like this
599:11 - all right we're gonna do set sheet
599:14 - visible equals and we're gonna give it
599:18 - an item and we'll do this we'll go props
599:23 - dot set sheet visible item and props dot
599:29 - set items visible to True okay and that
599:34 - looks good and I think
599:37 - uh pretty much we should be ready to go
599:39 - okay we have a start room component it
599:42 - takes in these things here okay we're
599:44 - giving it like what the set sheet create
599:46 - room prop already is we're passing it
599:49 - that's okay
599:51 - and um yeah so let's take a look okay
599:54 - I'm gonna hit refresh let's hit start a
599:56 - room boom we get add a topic right there
600:01 - okay right now there's no styling on it
600:03 - so it doesn't really do all that much
600:05 - but it's visible and I can see it now
600:08 - let's add the other ones okay so
600:11 - we still have finished this one yet
600:13 - under starter room so we got this at a
600:16 - topic
600:18 - let's go right underneath it we'll go
600:20 - div go class name and uh we'll go style
600:25 - dot select room all right and inside of
600:29 - this div I'll have a button cool and
600:31 - I'll go class name and we'll go room
600:34 - equals open
600:36 - all right so we we're using this ternary
600:39 - operator here so it's either if it's
600:41 - open then use the active style otherwise
600:44 - just blank style and uh another thing I
600:47 - want to add to this is I want to say hey
600:49 - on click what I want you to do is um
600:52 - give me give me a little something
600:55 - something okay so set room open okay so
600:58 - when I click then make sure that the
601:00 - room is now open okay great now we're
601:04 - still not done with this button we're
601:05 - gonna do a couple of things inside of
601:08 - here let's add throw in a div inside
601:10 - this div I'm going to throw in my FC
601:12 - Globe okay my FC Globe component slash
601:16 - icon that I'm getting from um react icon
601:19 - so if you haven't installed it make sure
601:21 - you go and you install it great and
601:25 - let's go ahead right underneath that div
601:28 - and what I want to say is open so that's
601:31 - pretty good let's hit save let's hit
601:33 - start a room oh not not that one let's
601:35 - hit start room so now you see the globe
601:37 - and you see open showing up that's a
601:39 - really good sign so we have certain
601:42 - things coming together okay so now we're
601:44 - gonna do something pretty similar and
601:47 - add the next few buns so let's add
601:50 - another button inside of this button
601:52 - actually let's uh let's play around with
601:55 - the attributes of this button so I'm
601:56 - going to say class name and I'm going to
601:58 - say hey if a room is equal to social
602:01 - then do me a favor and make the style
602:05 - active otherwise leave it blank
602:07 - okay and then
602:09 - uh maybe we'll add an on click for this
602:12 - as well so we'll do on click and I'm
602:14 - gonna say hey give me a set room and
602:17 - let's go social on this thing and then
602:20 - um let's go inside of the button and
602:23 - inside of this button here let's give me
602:25 - a div give me FC Globe let's add a
602:29 - self-closing tab just like this social
602:32 - let's hit start a room now we got two
602:34 - buttons here perfect and I need to do
602:37 - that one more time for close so I'm
602:39 - going to get a little bit smarter with
602:40 - it and uh I'm gonna grab this whole
602:43 - thing copy it actually maybe let's not
602:45 - copy the div let's just copy the button
602:48 - okay all the way to where the button
602:51 - ends and um let's just add it in and hit
602:55 - save okay and then the only thing I'm
602:58 - probably going to change neat to change
603:00 - here probably is closed set room to
603:02 - closed
603:03 - um and change this to closed hit refresh
603:06 - started room and now I got open so
603:09 - social closed open social close so still
603:14 - a lot left to go on The Styling but hey
603:17 - that's uh you know pretty good freaking
603:19 - start so that's good
603:21 - and in bottom sheet so I've added what I
603:24 - needed to add to the bottom machine I
603:25 - added to this not as good okay now we're
603:27 - gonna do change the style of start room
603:30 - bottom sheet and we're going to add tons
603:33 - and tons of styling and that's going to
603:34 - make things a lot better so inside our
603:37 - start room let's do a few things let's
603:39 - go to where our closed button is okay
603:42 - and where we're closing our div right
603:45 - underneath that let's open up a P tag
603:47 - and inside of here I'm going to say
603:50 - start a room like this and then I'm
603:54 - going to leave this empty space there
603:56 - all right we don't really even need that
603:58 - we can just actually leave it like this
603:59 - that's a better way to leave it they are
604:01 - right autocomplete is Right within this
604:04 - let's add a span tag okay and within the
604:07 - span tag I'm going to say hey if the
604:10 - room is closed can you double check that
604:14 - for me and if it is closed okay do me do
604:17 - me a favor okay if it's closed for
604:19 - people then write for people I choose
604:22 - all right otherwise check if the room is
604:27 - social and then basically say with
604:30 - people I follow so check for that so
604:35 - this is gonna be a question mark like
604:38 - this
604:39 - and then we're gonna do otherwise
604:43 - open to everyone all right so we got
604:47 - multi multiple turn nested
604:50 - if then statements ternary operators but
604:53 - all they're doing is when I click this
604:55 - it's a starter room open to everyone
604:58 - when I click social it's a starter room
605:00 - with people I follow when I click close
605:02 - it says starter room for people I choose
605:04 - so that's really what we're trying to do
605:07 - in our app and look it's working so
605:09 - that's pretty freaking cool right like
605:10 - if I click this it says start a room
605:12 - open to everyone click this start a room
605:15 - with people I follow click here sort of
605:17 - room for people I choose okay beautiful
605:20 - beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful
605:21 - beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful
605:21 - beautiful
605:24 - angel all right let's go div and I'm
605:27 - gonna go class name text Center and then
605:31 - inside of this div I'm going to add a
605:33 - button that button is going to have a
605:36 - class name of style dot Let Go Button
605:40 - we're gonna style this in a second so
605:42 - hold on to your panties for me please
605:43 - thank you on click I'm gonna go like
605:46 - this and we're gonna say perhaps a sheet
605:49 - create room set it to True okay
605:53 - and uh here so it's going to be set
605:56 - sheet create room okay so set sheet
605:59 - create room set sheet visible set it to
606:03 - true and then the the text for the
606:06 - button that I want is a
606:09 - confetti okay it's just not happening
606:12 - huh so we're just gonna what do I gotta
606:16 - do here ta-da make that copy it all
606:20 - right so confetti and I'm gonna say
606:22 - let's go just like that okay this is the
606:26 - let's go button so we're gonna create a
606:28 - special uh
606:30 - styling for it okay so let's hit start a
606:31 - room oh not this app the one we're
606:34 - working on so you can see we have let's
606:36 - go all the way at the bottom we have
606:38 - open social close we have added topics
606:40 - so now it's just a matter of styling so
606:43 - let's go to our bottom
606:45 - sheet.module.css and boy oh boy time to
606:49 - get to work
606:50 - so let's go with uh let's go with
606:53 - styling our switch line I'm gonna go
606:56 - position absolute position absolute and
607:01 - I will go top six pixels
607:04 - so we'll we'll start seeing differences
607:06 - a little bit later on but let's just
607:09 - keep going for now left 50 percent I
607:13 - want to go transform translate X
607:17 - negative 50 percent okay like that go
607:22 - height for pixels with 35 pixels uh
607:28 - background whoops background color give
607:32 - me a grayish color okay so it's this
607:37 - line right here okay it's a little hard
607:39 - to see but it's right there so for
607:41 - example if I remove that you don't see
607:43 - it if I add the color you see it right
607:45 - if I remove position absolute then it's
607:47 - to the left hand side uh of my face if I
607:51 - add position absolute then it's there
607:52 - right if I take out left 50 it's to the
607:55 - left again so that's what's that's how
607:58 - this that's what the switch line is okay
608:00 - then let's go add topic button and we'll
608:04 - go background color transparent okay
608:08 - beautiful and
608:10 - um probably gonna go border none on it
608:12 - so it looks cleaner refresh starter room
608:15 - so there we go now add a topic does not
608:18 - have that ugly border around it which
608:21 - we're probably going to remove from all
608:22 - of the other ones as well and color 2 8
608:26 - ae61 okay this is going to be that green
608:30 - color perfect now let's uh get our
608:33 - select room class let's go ahead and
608:36 - style it so let's go with border bottom
608:40 - one pixel and we'll go solid and we'll
608:43 - go gray on this one beautiful and then
608:47 - let's go padding on it 1.5 Em by zero
608:52 - I'm gonna go display Flex
608:55 - align items Center and then justify
608:59 - content space between okay there we go
609:04 - right so now we have space between and
609:07 - it's starting to look much much much
609:09 - much much much much better life of
609:11 - front-end developers get used to it get
609:15 - used to it as a react developer you are
609:18 - a front-end developer okay now let's go
609:21 - select room and we'll add a button again
609:24 - we'll do border none so I'm selecting
609:27 - all these buttons and removing all of
609:29 - their borders hopefully let's bring this
609:32 - down let's bring that up let's refresh
609:36 - order none let's go back on color and
609:39 - I'm gonna go transparent so now that
609:41 - background color is gone nice
609:44 - this is exciting I'm freaking excited
609:47 - making this with you guys
609:49 - let's give it a round some rounded
609:51 - Corners even though they're freaking
609:53 - invisible
609:55 - um
609:55 - let's give it a padding all right give
609:58 - it a padding okay and then let's give it
610:01 - the
610:02 - um Clubhouse color cool and then line
610:07 - height of 1.2 beautiful now it's looking
610:11 - really good we've squished it together
610:13 - just a little bit let's grab our select
610:15 - room class and inside of it let's do
610:18 - button active so border we're gonna give
610:21 - it one pixel solid and we're going to
610:23 - give it a light C green when something
610:26 - is active so now open is active now
610:29 - social is active and now closed and now
610:32 - closed is active so you see when it gets
610:34 - active it gets that like sign
610:37 - and then we're going to go background
610:39 - color and we'll go light blue and here
610:42 - right style DOT active that's where
610:45 - we're making that happen
610:47 - okay so if it's open then apply that
610:50 - style that's what we're doing
610:52 - beautiful so now I've got the background
610:54 - color so when I click
610:57 - that's oh that's awesome and then we're
611:00 - going to do now a couple of more things
611:03 - okay so now this is to select what's
611:04 - active now let's go with uh button div
611:08 - okay so let's attack the div and I'm
611:11 - going to give it a background color and
611:13 - let's go light C green again on it okay
611:16 - let's boom so it looks a little bit ugly
611:19 - but just bear with me let's give it a
611:21 - border radius of 1.5 let's go select our
611:27 - button SVG and change the font size to 4
611:31 - am okay so now they're much much much
611:33 - bigger let's go bottom sheet container
611:36 - let's grab the paragraph tag I'll go
611:38 - font size on this thing will be one em
611:42 - okay we'll go color uh let's go text
611:46 - color and I'll go text align Center
611:49 - beautiful so now this text is in the
611:51 - center so that's a really good sign and
611:54 - we'll go font weight 500.
611:57 - okay so now that's looking really really
611:59 - good and then let's work on the let
612:02 - let's go button I'll go font size 1.3 em
612:07 - font weight will go 500 on the Let Go
612:10 - Button uh let's go border none that's
612:13 - gonna make it look clean let's refresh
612:16 - hit starter room so starting to look
612:18 - clean we're probably gonna need to give
612:19 - it a border radius let's give it a
612:22 - border radius of 2 em okay let me
612:25 - refresh oh border radius right now we
612:30 - got those nice rounded Corners we'll
612:32 - give it font color of white okay now we
612:37 - need to of course give it a background
612:38 - color of that green
612:40 - 2 8 ae61 save nice now probably let's
612:45 - give it some padding 0.3 e m by 2 em yes
612:50 - nice that works and then let's go a text
612:54 - align on this thing and I'm gonna go
612:56 - Center oh man that is looking freaking
612:58 - beautiful okay start a room wow I am
613:03 - excited by this app man this is so
613:05 - freaking cool zoom in zoom out start a
613:09 - room
613:10 - starter room wow and I'm excited okay
613:14 - so that looks great The Styling is
613:17 - coming together and my neck is about to
613:19 - fall off I've been shooting for about
613:20 - eight hours but you know let's go let's
613:24 - freaking go you guys I'm pumped for you
613:27 - let's keep going
613:29 - so we got an added loader okay so let's
613:32 - work on that and uh let's work on also
613:34 - our home a little bit so let's go on our
613:38 - home JS and we're going to add I mean
613:42 - honestly we don't actually really need
613:43 - the loader the loader takes a bunch of
613:45 - work and does so freaking little but
613:50 - okay fine we can add it we can add it I
613:52 - won't be lazy I won't be lazy let's just
613:54 - go
613:55 - all right so let's go loader visibility
613:58 - okay and
614:00 - um here's what we're gonna do all right
614:02 - so my bad I meant to put parentheses
614:04 - here okay cool so loader visibility it's
614:08 - going to have a div inside of it all
614:10 - right and inside of this div we're going
614:12 - to have a certain styling okay so I'm
614:14 - going to assist dialing
614:16 - um and let's go position
614:18 - fixed and then I'll go top zero okay and
614:23 - we'll go uh right and we'll go bottom
614:27 - zero and we'll go left zero and we'll go
614:31 - display uh flex and align items and I'll
614:37 - go for Align items I will go Center and
614:40 - we'll go justify content and that'll
614:45 - also be Center so that's good so far
614:47 - let's go here I'll add in an image and
614:50 - we'll go images slide slash loader dot
614:53 - GIF so if we don't have this loader
614:55 - let's go ahead and bring it into our
614:57 - world I'm going to go to my public file
615:00 - images we got our loader right here okay
615:03 - so let's open up our uh let's open up
615:06 - our public we got our images let's drag
615:09 - our loader and drop it in there okay
615:11 - beautiful and let's close out of it
615:14 - because we need that loader okay and
615:17 - then we're going to have another
615:20 - beautiful little thing
615:22 - so basically this is a ternary operator
615:25 - right either this is going to happen if
615:27 - loader visibility is true or whatever is
615:31 - in this parenthesis is going to happen
615:33 - okay so here we go so in this
615:36 - parentheses it's pretty simple and it's
615:37 - going to be nothing
615:39 - so either display the loader doing its
615:41 - fancy things otherwise just do nothing
615:42 - and don't show anything and great so
615:45 - pretty freaking simple okay
615:48 - um not complicated simple so you see the
615:52 - loader came up right right when I hit
615:54 - let's go you'll see the loader popped up
615:56 - right there and it was there it's there
615:57 - as well when I hit it let's go and it's
615:59 - there again okay so very simple and very
616:02 - very clean and I think it actually shows
616:05 - up for one second I think that's why we
616:06 - did the set timeout right that's why we
616:08 - did set timeout and that allowed allows
616:11 - it to show up for one second I think if
616:14 - I if we do it 10 seconds here and then I
616:17 - hit start room and then we hit let's go
616:19 - this will probably show up for 10
616:21 - seconds okay so we're just kind of like
616:24 - hard coding our visibility so see what I
616:27 - said like trust me it'll make sense as
616:29 - we go on okay so it's hopefully already
616:32 - starting to make much more sense
616:34 - okay so we added the loader now let's go
616:38 - ahead and add new room bottom sheet so
616:42 - we'll go ahead and uh
616:44 - do that yeah new room is going to take a
616:47 - little bit but I think this one is going
616:49 - to be a pretty
616:51 - um pretty important one you know that we
616:53 - that we really need all right guys so
616:56 - now what we want to do is um we want to
616:58 - basically add a new room inside of the
617:02 - bottom sheet okay so what does that mean
617:04 - well when I click Start a room in my
617:06 - finished app and I hit let's go look it
617:08 - starts a new room okay and this is a
617:12 - bottom sheet okay so we have two bottom
617:15 - sheets one when I click Start room and
617:17 - one when I click let's go
617:20 - all right so those are two things that
617:23 - two types of sheets that we're gonna
617:25 - need all right so let's just get started
617:27 - on that and let's start working on it
617:30 - um I'm gonna work on my component so
617:32 - let's go inside of our components right
617:35 - click and we're going to go inside of
617:37 - our bottom sheet folder and in here I'm
617:40 - going to create a new file it's going to
617:42 - be called new room
617:44 - dot JS again we're going to import
617:47 - everything we need we're going to need
617:49 - to use uh use State at some point so
617:51 - let's get that now let's import The
617:54 - Styling okay and if there's any styling
617:57 - that we don't have yet we just go ahead
618:00 - and make it so we know it's going to
618:01 - complain at some point about not having
618:03 - room detail module.css so right click
618:06 - and let's just make it just in case we
618:08 - don't have it so room detail dot module
618:12 - dot CSS just like that all right so we
618:15 - got this
618:16 - um made so that's good now let's go back
618:19 - and get some fonts that uh get some
618:22 - fonts and things that we're going to
618:24 - need some icons I mean outline
618:27 - file okay and I'm gonna do from react
618:30 - icon slash AI
618:33 - okay beautiful
618:35 - and uh the other icon I'm going to need
618:37 - is BS mic mute fill and let's give it BS
618:42 - just like this
618:44 - now we're creating a new component
618:46 - called new room and here's we're going
618:49 - to be using our state variables like mic
618:51 - mute visible and set mic mute
618:55 - visible and it's going to start off with
618:59 - false what does this mean so if I go to
619:01 - my finished version of the app if I hit
619:03 - start room and if I hit let's go look
619:05 - all the way at the bottom right you're
619:07 - going to see the mic if I click that mic
619:09 - it becomes and this becomes mute as well
619:12 - right here and when I unclick it there's
619:14 - no mute that's there anymore how's that
619:17 - happening well this is actually where
619:21 - um we're using our state variables to
619:24 - make sure that we keep that information
619:26 - we can show it in real time okay so
619:28 - that's what's really going on there and
619:31 - let's go down and I'm going to go card
619:35 - props.card detail
619:38 - beautiful
619:40 - so we got our you state hook
619:43 - and we're using it here that's beautiful
619:45 - and it's helping us all right so now I
619:49 - want to make sure I return and we want
619:52 - to return something so right now I'm
619:53 - just going to say potatoes
619:56 - all right potatoes so I'm not going to
619:58 - return anything useful but what I want
620:00 - to do is connect this component where
620:03 - it's going to be shown and that way then
620:06 - when I'm making changes I can actually
620:07 - see them happen in real time okay so
620:11 - we're gonna go do that so let's go to
620:13 - our home file home.js
620:16 - and let's go down down down where should
620:20 - we add this
620:21 - okay so right when
620:24 - where am I doing my timeout cool so
620:27 - right underneath where I'm doing my
620:28 - timeout we're going to add this and
620:30 - we're going to add a bottom sheet just
620:32 - like that and we're gonna go this is
620:36 - going to be a self-closing tag so let's
620:38 - just close it right away
620:39 - we're gonna go sheet title is new
620:43 - room and
620:46 - set sheet
620:48 - visible
620:50 - is going to be taken an item and let's
620:53 - go set sheet create room
620:57 - okay I'm just going to set it to
620:59 - Whatever item we pass it boom let's go
621:02 - sheet visible like this and uh card
621:07 - detail we're gonna do new room data and
621:11 - set items visible I'm going to do taking
621:15 - an item and we'll do set items visible
621:20 - to item okay now this new room data that
621:25 - we're giving it here it's clearly not
621:27 - imported so let's go ahead and import
621:30 - that so I'm going to do import new
621:32 - room data from
621:36 - um and actually we need to get our data
621:38 - as well okay because we're going to need
621:39 - to use that data at some point so first
621:42 - let's go ahead and make that file
621:44 - so we have our new room Json file okay
621:47 - which is this one right here and again
621:50 - ours is pretty simple we're going to
621:52 - keep it really really simple so let's go
621:55 - inside of source and inside of source
621:58 - let's go inside of data and in my data
622:02 - I'm going to create a new file and we're
622:04 - going to call it
622:05 - newroom.json all right and let's just
622:07 - paste all of this there okay
622:10 - so that is paste pasted all right so if
622:14 - I go to our app right now our app is
622:16 - saying hey new room data is not defined
622:18 - so we made our data now we're just
622:22 - simply need to import it okay so I'm
622:24 - going to say import new room data and
622:26 - we're going to say from
622:28 - let's go
622:30 - bottom
622:32 - sheets
622:34 - Slash new room
622:35 - okay so bottom sheets slash
622:39 - new room just like that
622:43 - all right and that's gonna really
622:46 - um that's gonna basically import that so
622:48 - that complaint should stop now it says
622:51 - hey can't resolve this so let's go check
622:54 - what is happening right now and why I
622:57 - can't resolve that
622:58 - so
623:00 - new room data
623:03 - okay currently I'm in my pages in
623:06 - home.js so I might have to back out of
623:08 - the directory and then go into
623:12 - bottom sheets let's check
623:14 - pages home.js
623:17 - yeah
623:19 - might have to back out and go to data
623:21 - right so back out slash data slash
623:25 - bottom sheets and new room set refresh
623:28 - let's make this small lowercase it
623:33 - actually let's uh Delete let's delete
623:36 - this
623:38 - because we cannot import that there but
623:41 - let's go
623:43 - actually let's go new room data
623:47 - not in bottom sheets because that's not
623:49 - where it's at I don't know why I'm going
623:51 - crazy so let's go data Slash new room
623:53 - okay and let's do dot Json
623:56 - okay
623:58 - let's hit refresh and now that's good
624:03 - okay
624:04 - beautiful exactly what we're looking for
624:08 - all right so so far when I hit start
624:10 - room and I hit let's go it just keeps
624:12 - opening
624:13 - uh new sheets
624:16 - but it just feels like they're kind of
624:18 - on top of each other right so we're
624:20 - going to go ahead and fix that and make
624:23 - it so it actually opens new sheets okay
624:26 - so let's go and uh let's go back into
624:30 - our
624:31 - um
624:32 - let's go back into a bottom sheet.js
624:36 - okay and make a couple of changes
624:40 - so let's go bottom sheet.js this is our
624:43 - component
624:45 - okay and to this component what I want
624:48 - to do is let's go under
624:51 - let's go here and let's import our room
624:54 - so important
624:55 - new room
624:58 - from
625:00 - and I'll go bottom sheets
625:03 - slash
625:05 - new room
625:07 - okay
625:09 - so now we got that import and let's go
625:13 - to
625:15 - all the way where we added a background
625:17 - color for profile
625:20 - and right underneath here
625:22 - all right guys so now conceptually this
625:24 - is important to understand before we
625:26 - continue so here I have this one that
625:29 - start room right so this sheet title
625:33 - whoa
625:34 - all right this sheet title is going to
625:37 - be
625:38 - um this is our start room
625:41 - okay that's what the sheet title is here
625:45 - and um when I click let's remove this
625:49 - when I click let's go
625:51 - right and it opens up a new room now the
625:55 - sheet title is different so now the
625:57 - sheet title is actually
625:59 - a new room
626:01 - okay so this is going to be important
626:04 - for us because based on what somebody
626:07 - did we're going to show them a different
626:10 - sheet okay
626:12 - and that's how we're able to do that so
626:14 - just keep that in mind as we go along
626:16 - and write the next part of the code okay
626:20 - so I'm just going to start off with this
626:22 - so let's
626:23 - I'm going to cut this we're going to
626:25 - need this in a second I'm just going to
626:28 - cut this for now
626:30 - okay and here's what we're gonna do
626:33 - I will
626:34 - make the squiggly here and we're going
626:38 - to
626:39 - basically say
626:41 - hey if this sheet title is
626:46 - new room
626:48 - okay question mark then I want you to do
626:51 - the following
626:52 - show me the new room
626:55 - okay so this has similar
626:59 - code
627:00 - and uh we're going to paste it and let's
627:03 - do new room as our component okay and
627:06 - I'll import it so if I hit enter
627:08 - hopefully that imported it oh no already
627:11 - imported so that's good a new room we're
627:14 - gonna do the same types of things but
627:16 - let's go down and we're going to say
627:18 - card detail
627:20 - is going to be props
627:23 - Dot card detail just like that
627:26 - we are going to do set sheet visible
627:30 - but we won't need this or do this
627:34 - okay
627:36 - so let's go ahead and fix what it's
627:38 - complaining about
627:40 - we got our new room opening up here
627:44 - and now the new room actually needs to
627:46 - close so we probably need to close that
627:50 - within this there we go so if you see
627:54 - new room then show me this component
627:57 - now on the other hand though if you see
628:01 - start room
628:03 - like this
628:04 - then I want you to do something
628:06 - different I want you to do this
628:09 - okay so now we're getting into nested
628:12 - ternary operator sometimes it gets like
628:14 - a little bit tricky to visualize this
628:16 - but just follow along with me here and
628:19 - once this is done you'll be able to see
628:21 - what we're doing here okay and now
628:24 - I'm going to paste my start room one
628:28 - that we had earlier
628:29 - okay
628:31 - and uh let's what do we need okay
628:35 - we need to make sure that our start room
628:37 - actually closes at some point and ends
628:41 - start room
628:43 - not there
628:44 - so let's end it
628:46 - okay let's remove these quotes right
628:49 - there
628:50 - don't need them anymore and let's end
628:53 - our start room component let's hit save
628:57 - okay beautiful and then we'll say
628:59 - otherwise just do nothing okay so how we
629:03 - read this ternary operator is like this
629:06 - hey are we
629:09 - um hey is this a new room
629:11 - that's being created
629:13 - okay if it's start room being created
629:15 - then show the start room so show all of
629:17 - this stuff okay if it's a new room being
629:21 - created for example when we hit let's go
629:23 - then show this the potato
629:26 - uh
629:28 - room that we created okay so that's this
629:30 - new room otherwise do nothing that's
629:34 - really it okay and we got this question
629:37 - mark here
629:38 - so if the first thing is true then it'll
629:41 - show all of that otherwise it'll go
629:44 - through this secondary secondary
629:47 - um ternary operator that we added there
629:49 - okay beautiful so now our sheets are
629:51 - working as we hoped they would so that's
629:54 - a really good sign and now let's go
629:56 - ahead and build out our
629:59 - uh our sheet okay so I'm gonna go into
630:02 - our new room which is in which is a
630:06 - bottom sheet component that we're making
630:08 - and let's go ahead and build that out
630:11 - all the way now so instead of potatoes
630:14 - we're gonna make it much better than
630:16 - that
630:17 - let's end our jsx fragment here
630:21 - okay
630:23 - and let's go and I'm gonna go div all
630:26 - right and we'll give it a class name of
630:30 - sell that room detail container and
630:34 - again we're going to add all these
630:35 - stylings if we don't have them already
630:37 - within this div I'm going to have
630:39 - another div and I'm going to do a class
630:40 - name
630:41 - and we'll do style dot head and of
630:45 - course let's go like this
630:48 - um and then let's go and do do class
630:52 - name in here
630:53 - and we're again going to use bootstrap

636:45 - room sheet meaning like we're gonna add
636:48 - more things inside of here so it doesn't
636:49 - look that boring right
636:52 - as you can see this looks much more
636:53 - interesting and this body will contain
636:55 - people and it will contain images and
636:57 - things like that so let's go ahead and
637:00 - work on that body now
637:01 - so I'm going to go back into my uh new
637:06 - room and in this new room JS let's go
637:10 - here pretty much
637:13 - um almost all the way to the end but
637:14 - just one level above it
637:16 - I'm going to add a div and let's give it
637:20 - a class name of go style dot detail room
637:25 - detail card
637:28 - and inside of here I'm going to have
637:30 - another div a class name of again we're
637:34 - going to go d-flex on this which is just
637:36 - display flex and align item Center
637:39 - justify content between and then we'll
637:43 - go flex wrap like this
637:46 - okay very cool and then the next thing I
637:49 - want to add to this div is I want to add
637:51 - some styling so let's go here and let's
637:54 - add some padding padding of 0.5 em and
638:00 - by 1 AM
638:01 - now you might be wondering Causey why
638:03 - are you doing this with bootstrap and
638:05 - then why are you doing this like little
638:07 - line of styling here well we using this
638:11 - right just bootstrap gets us almost all
638:14 - the way there with the styling that we
638:15 - need to do
638:16 - and then I just need to add one more
638:18 - line so I'm not going to create it in a
638:20 - whole new file and try to maintain it
638:22 - it's fine just add some inline styling
638:24 - for it you're good okay nobody's gonna
638:26 - go crazy
638:28 - um so that's good okay let's go inside
638:31 - of this div now
638:33 - um and then I'm going to basically Now
638:37 - display those cards of the people that
638:39 - are actually in the room
638:41 - all right so let's go card dot members
638:44 - .map we'll go item so let's Loop through
638:48 - all the card members
638:51 - and uh here's what we are going to do
638:53 - okay let's have a div
638:56 - in here
638:58 - and within this div
639:01 - um I want to do
639:03 - I want to do a couple of things okay
639:05 - let's give it a class name because we're
639:08 - going to uh style this so style dot
639:11 - member container
639:14 - okay
639:16 - and then I'm gonna go hey it's Mike mute
639:19 - visible question mark
639:22 - um if it is visible so let's just
639:24 - complete this okay so I'm gonna go like
639:26 - that okay now it's complaining about
639:28 - something and let's see what it's
639:30 - complaining about it's probably
639:31 - complaining about so this is ending
639:34 - we're ending this we're opening and
639:37 - this should be closed with this all
639:39 - right so let's go ahead and do this so
639:43 - right now I'm basically saying hey if
639:46 - the mic mute visible is true then do
639:50 - nothing otherwise do nothing so
639:52 - obviously we're going to add
639:54 - um add things in here right now okay so
639:57 - for mic mute visible
639:59 - if it is true we're going to do the
640:03 - following I'm going to say show me a div
640:06 - give it a class name style dot audio
640:10 - icon and here I want to say mic mute
640:15 - fill so we're importing that at the top

642:21 - having those big ass faces in there we
642:23 - have to
642:24 - um we have to you know style this
642:27 - because it's it's you know to be frank
642:29 - it's out of control so let's go to our
642:33 - roomdetail.module.css all right and
642:35 - we're gonna style this thing so let's go
642:37 - here and uh start adding in all right
642:41 - we're gonna go room detail
642:43 - card and I'm going to give it a
642:46 - background color so so far we don't
642:49 - really see that much happening okay no
642:51 - worries let's go padding or one em one
642:55 - em
642:57 - 3M and one M okay so we got some padding
643:01 - in there and I of course I want to
643:04 - control the images so let's control the
643:06 - images a little bit too so room detail
643:08 - card let's go image and I'll go with 70
643:12 - pixels okay so let's see if that
643:14 - controls the images a little bit hit
643:16 - let's go
643:17 - so now the images are much more in
643:19 - control right and we have a background
643:21 - color of white that you can see there we
643:23 - got raphae we got Nas good good good
643:26 - good let's give each image a border
643:29 - radius of 1.7 em
643:34 - and let's continue styling this so I'm
643:37 - going to go border radius for the whole
643:39 - thing and I want to do 1.5 em 1.5 am and
643:44 - then let's go zero zero so now these
643:47 - Corners have they're nice and rounded
643:49 - and height I'm gonna go 90 VH so now
643:54 - it's 90 viewport height okay so now it's
643:57 - much bigger than when we started and
644:00 - let's go overflow Auto
644:04 - restart hit start room hit let's go
644:07 - beautiful so far so good let's continue
644:10 - styling this so we're going to style the
644:12 - H6 on this thing so let's go room detail
644:14 - card H6 uh we don't have an H6 yet not
644:19 - that I can remember but let's go ahead
644:21 - and style it anyway because we're
644:23 - probably gonna need this later so I'm
644:25 - going to add that in so font size
644:28 - 0.675 em okay
644:31 - let's give it a color of uh text color
644:35 - we will go font weight of 500 like this
644:40 - and then of course let's go margin
644:42 - bottom 0.3
644:44 - em
644:46 - all right so we're going to see a lot of
644:48 - those changes taking place once we add
644:51 - an H6 okay
644:53 - right now we don't have them let's style
644:56 - our uh we'll style our H3 later as well
645:00 - if we ever needed a H3 for this
645:03 - let's style Our member container I think
645:06 - that's important so let's go member
645:09 - container like so and um I'm gonna go
645:13 - text the line
645:15 - Center
645:16 - okay let's refresh start room let's go
645:19 - we will go uh width of it is 70 pixels
645:23 - and Position will give it relative
645:27 - relative like that refresh hit let's go
645:32 - Okay cool so far it's looking good and
645:37 - now let's go remember container audio
645:40 - icon and I'm going to say position
645:43 - absolute and we'll go right negative
645:47 - five pixels
645:48 - bottom 36 okay so we're gonna make we're
645:53 - gonna make the icon show up
645:55 - that's our goal make the audio icon show
645:58 - up on the screen
646:00 - we're gonna give it a z index of
646:03 - five and let's go maybe give it a
646:07 - background color of background color of
646:11 - and let's just make it white
646:13 - for now
646:15 - with 25 pixels and height I'm gonna go
646:19 - 25 pixels
646:22 - okay let's hit refresh let's go
646:25 - this thing let's sometimes zooming out
646:28 - can actually help as well
646:30 - now to have that icon show up the mic
646:34 - icon what I'm going to do is uh let's
646:37 - just go ahead and set this to true and
646:40 - that will make sure that that shows up
646:42 - the whole time okay and then the then we
646:46 - can essentially just go on styling and
646:48 - make sure
646:50 - everything is looking looking
646:54 - um how we want it to look so let's keep
646:56 - styling our audio icon here all right so
647:00 - I'm going to give it a border radius of
647:03 - 50 so now it has those rounded Corners
647:08 - around it going to
647:10 - use uh display flex and I'm going to
647:13 - align items Center
647:16 - cool
647:17 - and then justify content let's go Center
647:21 - so everything is looking good and then I
647:24 - want to do box Shadow and add a little
647:27 - box Shadow to it so let's uh let's do
647:30 - that oh nice look at that that just made
647:34 - it pop out right it has that little nice
647:37 - gray backdrop to it and that makes it
647:39 - pop out just like how we want it so
647:42 - that's looking beautiful so far now
647:45 - let's go ahead and color that audio icon
647:48 - so I'm going to go here let's go audio
647:50 - icon and let's grab this VG and I'm
647:54 - going to give it a color of 2 8 e a e 6
647:59 - 1. so let's save save again refresh okay
648:04 - so now it has that like nice green color
648:07 - that we wanted it to have
648:09 - beautiful very clubhousey looking okay
648:12 - let's go member container I'm gonna go
648:15 - display Flex we're gonna go align item
648:18 - Center and this will be useful for the
648:21 - text stuff that we have so I'm gonna go
648:23 - font size one em and again if you're
648:28 - ever like hey I want the stylings to
648:30 - work sometimes just refresh okay and
648:32 - that'll show you
648:34 - um whether the styling is working or not
648:36 - okay cool
648:38 - and uh then uh this is again we're gonna
648:41 - need this later but I would just want to
648:44 - keep keep the styling here font wait
648:47 - 500 and then color
648:50 - let's go with
648:52 - okay awesome and uh next up let's style
648:57 - our span tag so I'm going to go member
649:00 - container and we'll grab span let's give
649:03 - it a font size of 2.5 em boom
649:07 - boom shakalaka we will give it a display
649:11 - inline block with I'm going to make it
649:14 - 14 pixels so let's
649:16 - just you know make it a little bit
649:18 - smaller we'll give it a height of 14
649:21 - pixels
649:23 - beautiful
649:25 - border radius will be 50 let's give it a
649:30 - background color
649:32 - and I'm gonna go to 2886
649:36 - ae61 okay so that gives it a little
649:38 - green and
649:41 - let's get it uh white color
649:44 - margin right and I will go 0.1 em
649:48 - beautiful so that margin from that
649:50 - little button that we gave it right
649:52 - gives it a little margin beautiful
649:55 - and line height
649:58 - of 0.8 and that's good
650:02 - oh look at that it's looking clean so
650:05 - all I had to do was just add a little
650:07 - line height there and it gives it that
650:10 - stylistic green
650:12 - color
650:13 - okay so we are uh we are all good with
650:19 - this component now the new room JS we
650:22 - have it doing what we wanted to do and
650:24 - now let's go ahead and add footer in our
650:27 - new room sheet okay so we're going to
650:29 - need a couple of images that we're going
650:31 - to need access to
650:33 - so let's go ahead and grab those images
650:36 - reveal all right so we're going to need
650:39 - access to our hand piece symbol and
650:41 - we're going to need access to our stop
650:43 - hand
650:44 - so both of these uh let's go public
650:47 - images I'm going to grab this drop it in
650:50 - images
650:51 - so both of those okay why do we need
650:54 - access to this well because you see here
650:55 - at the bottom leave quietly
650:57 - and then this raised hand here
651:00 - that's why okay and now time to make
651:04 - this footer work so let's go into our
651:07 - new room JS and we're going to add
651:10 - another one okay so we're going to do AI
651:13 - outline Plus
651:16 - why because if I look at my finished
651:18 - version I need this plus sign here
651:21 - okay and now I'm going to do another
651:24 - import that's going to give me this icon
651:26 - so these two are going to be images and
651:28 - then these two are going to be Imports
651:31 - so let's go ahead and grab we got mic
651:35 - mute fill let's go ahead and grab just
651:38 - the mic fill as well okay
651:41 - let's go
651:43 - down here and I'm going to do const
651:48 - we'll set a new state variable items
651:51 - visible and I'm going to go set items
651:53 - visible and we'll set default state to
651:57 - be
651:58 - true just like this
652:00 - okay
652:01 - and we'll go down here all right
652:06 - okay so we finish this here we got a div
652:09 - let's go underneath the second div and
652:12 - add it in go div class name and let's go
652:16 - style dot footer and I'll create button
652:20 - okay we'll go on click
652:22 - props dot set
652:25 - sheet visible false
652:28 - like this
652:29 - and that button will end and then inside
652:31 - of that button I'm going to add an image
652:34 - and that's going to be the hand piece
652:37 - image
652:39 - handpiece.jpg or actually is it PNG I
652:43 - think it's PNG yes it's a PNG
652:46 - boom son
652:48 - okay all right so
652:51 - it's this one oh not that one so we got
652:55 - the hand icon and then we have the hand
652:57 - piece dot PNG right there
652:59 - beautiful
653:01 - and underneath this button we're going
653:03 - to add another div
653:06 - and this div will have a button
653:09 - and this button will be a AI outline
653:13 - plus button that we already imported
653:17 - and that's it
653:18 - refresh let's go
653:21 - so I see the plus button and it's
653:24 - underneath the peace sign
653:25 - okay you should see it too
653:28 - but it's like hard to see it's like all
653:31 - the way at the freaking bottom all right
653:33 - so it should be there on your on yours
653:35 - uh too if you're following along so far
653:37 - let's go button underneath here and guys
653:40 - look if you're following along so far by
653:42 - the way I just want to say you're doing
653:43 - a phenomenal job keep going don't quit
653:46 - look what is this just a couple of hours
653:48 - and you have a fully finalized project
653:51 - on your portfolio that you can show it
653:53 - to your recruiter and at a job interview
653:55 - okay so don't quit keep on going and
653:57 - we're gonna finish this together
653:59 - so I'm going to add another button and
654:01 - inside of this button I'm going to add
654:03 - an image and it's going to be Images
654:05 - slash stophand icon dot PNG like this
654:09 - okay and then my button ends and
654:12 - underneath that let's add another button
654:14 - and I'll go on click uh give me
654:18 - the following set mic mute visible and
654:23 - basically just change its current value
654:27 - okay between toggling it on and off
654:31 - okay and this button is going to be
654:35 - a dynamic little button okay
654:39 - so let's go inside of our button here
654:44 - and I'm going to say mic mute visible if
654:47 - that's true
654:49 - then
654:50 - give me mic mute fill
654:54 - otherwise
654:55 - you can also give me just mic fill
655:00 - look at that when I click this button it
655:03 - toggles as on and off like this now I
655:06 - can remove that hard-coded true
655:08 - statement that I have here let's make
655:10 - that false so now when I refresh my app
655:13 - and I hit start room and I hit let's go
655:16 - it won't be muted muted by default
655:20 - but if I go down here and I see
655:23 - my mic and I click that mic notice that
655:27 - it gives me that muted uh styling that
655:30 - we did and even at the bottom you see
655:33 - that it gives us that muted styling
655:35 - right
655:36 - so that's freaking cool that's awesome
655:39 - beautiful
655:41 - all right so our job here is is good but
655:45 - we have to of course style the bottom
655:46 - because the bottom still you know is not
655:49 - the prettiest looking thing on the
655:51 - planet so let's go room detail
655:53 - module.css let's go footer display Flex
655:57 - okay so already it's starting to get in
655:59 - some type of control it's
656:02 - not as hideous anymore
656:04 - I'm just zooming in so you can see it
656:06 - clearer let's go align item Center
656:10 - justify content I'll go space between
656:14 - we'll go position absolute
656:18 - and again I'm going to do left zero and
656:21 - we'll do
656:23 - right zero and we'll do bottom zero
656:28 - okay beautiful let's give it a
656:31 - background color and make sure that that
656:33 - color is
656:34 - white okay
656:37 - start a room let's go nice
656:40 - okay great
656:43 - great great great great now let's give
656:45 - uh let's work with the footer buttons
656:48 - so style the buttons we'll give it a
656:51 - background color of okay
656:54 - so
656:55 - let's go ahead and do it all right so
656:58 - that color like does that make any
657:00 - changes to it at all
657:02 - what the heck okay well we'll just leave
657:04 - it at the color that it was then we'll
657:06 - give it a border of none so those ugly
657:09 - borders should go away it still looks
657:11 - pretty hideous so we'll we'll fix that
657:14 - in a second let's go to em all right so
657:16 - now it has somewhat of a border radius
657:18 - so it looks a little bit better
657:20 - um
657:21 - let's grab the images Now button images
657:24 - and I'm going to give it a width of 30
657:27 - pixels so now those images are smaller
657:30 - and they also look much more high
657:31 - quality right because they're probably
657:33 - not the highest resolution things on the
657:35 - planet
657:36 - let's grab the button inside here and we
657:40 - will say display Flex on this
657:43 - we'll go align items Center
657:46 - so this will give us some vertical
657:47 - alignment we'll give it padding so the
657:51 - buttons have a little bit more uh meat
657:55 - in them just like this color we're going
657:58 - to give it that little green color that
658:00 - we always give things that's going to be
658:02 - the text color so you're not going to
658:04 - see that right this second
658:05 - and font
658:07 - wait I'm going to give it 500. okay so
658:12 - if you did want to see it we could go to
658:14 - new room JS and we can find this button
658:18 - that has the hand piece thing in it and
658:21 - we can add text in here so I can say
658:25 - leave
658:26 - quietly
658:28 - and hit save and boom
658:32 - you actually see leave quietly at the
658:35 - bottom just like that just like you
658:37 - would imagine
658:38 - and that looks great
658:40 - okay so our styling is coming together
658:43 - how we want it and we're very happy with
658:46 - it okay
658:48 - let's go down and let's go to div I'm
658:51 - going to do display Flex
658:53 - align items
658:55 - Center
658:56 - okay great let's go footer grab the div
659:01 - and we're going to get the button inside
659:02 - of it let's give it a line height of one
659:05 - width of 36 pixels
659:08 - so now they're all looking somewhat even
659:13 - we still have certain so like we still
659:16 - have these things too close to each
659:18 - other so I imagine we might want to give
659:20 - a little bit of margin let's look at our
659:22 - final product so it looks like there's a
659:24 - little bit of margin in these right
659:26 - where whereas in hours there really
659:30 - isn't that much margin in between those
659:32 - the other things I noticed is my hand
659:34 - icon here or image here is centered uh
659:38 - horizontally here it's not so I'm
659:40 - probably going to need to do that at
659:42 - some point so let's uh add a border
659:46 - radius first let's go border radius
659:49 - and we'll go 50 percent
659:52 - cool
659:53 - we're going to go display Flex
659:56 - okay the buttons are now like we going
659:58 - crazy everywhere so let's go align item
660:01 - Center
660:02 - this will vertically align them and then
660:05 - we'll go justify content and this will
660:08 - horizontally Center them okay
660:11 - vertically Center horizontally Center
660:14 - and now they're looking much better
660:16 - again we're still going to need to give
660:17 - a little bit of margin so we're going to
660:20 - do that now so let's go into the footer
660:22 - go into the div going to the button grab
660:25 - the first oh dib let's go div we'll go
660:29 - button and first child all right and
660:33 - inside of the first child I want to go
660:34 - font size 1.5 VM on this
660:38 - give me that 1.5 em
660:40 - and we'll go margin right 0.5 yeah
660:45 - let's refresh
660:46 - start our room let's go
660:48 - okay so now we got that margin showing
660:51 - up and now we want to add the margin to
660:54 - the second child because I said hey
660:55 - specifically give me the margin on this
660:59 - child here now we're going to add a
661:02 - margin to the right of our second child
661:04 - so how do we do that
661:06 - how do we do that it's very simple it's
661:09 - pretty much this exact same thing except
661:12 - of course we are not going to change the
661:15 - font size and instead of first child I'm
661:17 - going to say nth child and we'll just go
661:20 - to
661:21 - great we got it and then lastly
661:25 - let's go ahead and make the font size a
661:27 - little bit bigger because the plus sign
661:29 - looks really big the hand sign slapping
661:31 - sign looks big but the mic is much
661:33 - smaller compared to that so we're going
661:34 - to grab the third child and
661:37 - um not margin right but instead we're
661:39 - going to grab the font size and boom now
661:43 - the mic looks much much much bigger okay
661:46 - so we're done with the styling here
661:48 - we're having things show if I hit mute
661:51 - it makes the mute thing come up right
661:54 - my leave quietly actually works that was
661:57 - cool when I did leave quietly it leaves
662:00 - freaking amazing right so the
662:02 - functionality wise this app is coming
662:05 - along beautifully and we're almost at
662:07 - the Finish Line we just have a couple of
662:09 - more things to do
662:11 - all right now let's go ahead and add
662:14 - um add a Explorer page so what do I mean
662:16 - by that when I click here notice this
662:20 - explore page okay there's a lot of
662:22 - things happening here okay you got the
662:24 - follow button you got this card here you
662:26 - got a bunch of cards that show up here
662:28 - so we're gonna go ahead and add that
662:31 - functionality in as well okay so first
662:34 - things first let's install a couple of
662:37 - things so let's go yarn add again on
662:39 - your computer that might be npm install
662:41 - if you do not have yarn so let's go yarn
662:44 - add and we're going to do ant design
662:46 - like this we're gonna need this for some
662:49 - of our styling and then after this I'm
662:52 - going to do yarn add and okay I'm gonna
662:55 - need that as well
662:57 - so in terms of installing things that
663:01 - should take care of what we need
663:03 - okay
663:04 - leave quietly not quiet little
663:08 - um and we're going to add up we're going
663:11 - to add a couple of things here
663:14 - okay so let's go to app.js
663:17 - and here let's import explore from
663:22 - Pages slash Explorer now it's going to
663:25 - complain and it's going to be like hey I
663:27 - cannot resolve this Explorer component
663:29 - what the heck is going on
663:32 - well no worries that's because we have
663:34 - to go ahead and make our Explorer okay
663:37 - and we gotta we gotta add in the things
663:39 - that we need there
663:41 - so
663:42 - um one thing I want to do is actually uh
663:45 - get the data ready for explore so we can
663:47 - play with the data so let's go hit new
663:49 - file and I will go
663:51 - explore.json this is going to be the the
663:54 - dummy data that we're going to use
663:56 - okay so let's right click and let's
663:59 - reveal in finder and uh I mean you can't
664:03 - reveal in finder there's nothing for you
664:05 - okay but I have this for you you're
664:08 - gonna have to go and get it from the
664:10 - link in description of the video
664:11 - [Music]
664:13 - okay
664:15 - so let's go ahead and uh open this file
664:18 - not like this but I can open it like
664:23 - this great so paste all right so we got
664:27 - this is going to be the Demi data that
664:29 - we need all good we got access to it and
664:32 - let's Now work on our explorer.js page
664:34 - slash screen slash component so many
664:37 - terms in react so inside of source go
664:42 - inside of pages
664:45 - um and I'm going to hit new file and
664:48 - we're going to go explore.js just like
664:51 - this all right let's go import react
664:54 - from react
664:56 - import style from style explore
665:01 - module.css now it's going to complain
665:04 - hey that styling doesn't exist great
665:07 - let's go to style and let's make it
665:09 - explore.module
665:12 - dot CSS just like that and let's also go
665:16 - import
665:17 - down outlined fire outlined I'm gonna
665:21 - need these
665:22 - from
665:23 - ant
665:25 - design icons just like that
665:28 - okay why do we need that import well
665:30 - let's go here and we're going to need
665:32 - things like this like that fire icon
665:35 - okay and let's go import data from data
665:39 - slash explore Json cool now let's work
665:43 - on our explore component so I'm going to
665:45 - say export default function Explorer
665:50 - and we're gonna have people a con uh
665:55 - conversion conversation let's go
665:57 - conversation and I'm going to set this
666:00 - to data okay so I'm just unpacking
666:03 - people and conversations if I go to my
666:05 - Json I got people all right and I got
666:08 - another object called conversation so I
666:11 - am just uh unpacking this there's some
666:13 - other term in react I forget but in um
666:16 - python you call it uh Tuple unpacking
666:19 - but here
666:20 - um I forget the term as like a es6 thing
666:23 - that you can do okay really cool and
666:26 - let's go return and we're going to go
666:28 - div
666:29 - and I'm going to give it a class name of
666:32 - style Dot Explorer container and again
666:36 - we're going to style that later
666:38 - let's go and have an H6 here and we go
666:42 - people to follow just like that
666:46 - and then we're going to have div here
666:49 - and let's go
666:51 - style dot people container all right and
666:54 - inside of here we're going to do our
666:56 - people Loop so we have our people and
666:59 - we're going to go people map
667:01 - and let's grab a person or let's just do
667:05 - item okay and this is an implicit return
667:08 - statement that I'm doing
667:10 - and let's go within this div
667:13 - and let's do a couple of things so I'm
667:15 - going to go display Flex on this align
667:19 - items
667:20 - Center
667:21 - let's go within this div here add an
667:24 - image and we'll go let me just slash
667:28 - user image.jpg or as I like to say japeg
667:32 - and let's go add another div we'll give
667:35 - it a class name of
667:37 - margin left 2. okay thanks to bootstrap
667:41 - for helping us out here we'll send add
667:43 - an H5 go item dot title okay now there's
667:49 - a lot that we're doing here so let's go
667:51 - ahead and
667:53 - add this component somewhere we can so
667:55 - so we can at least start seeing it
667:57 - before we go ahead and add a bunch of
667:59 - more things otherwise it's kind of
668:00 - confusing so let's go to app.js
668:03 - we're importing our Explorer but now
668:06 - let's go ahead and add it so I'm going
668:08 - to go
668:09 - and
668:11 - in our home we're also not going to add
668:13 - explore
668:14 - just like that and
668:17 - we're going to add another route
668:19 - statement inside of our switch and let's
668:24 - just do this component regularly how we
668:27 - do all our other components I'm going to
668:29 - go component
668:30 - explore like this and we're going to go
668:34 - call it Explorer just like that okay
668:36 - let's hit refresh cool something weird
668:39 - happened so when I click it I see people
668:41 - to follow at the top and then I see a
668:43 - bunch of images okay so it's working
668:45 - somewhat when I click that image it at
668:48 - least takes me here
668:49 - let's go back and finish up all the
668:53 - styling for it that we started
668:55 - so in our explore page let's add a
668:58 - couple of more things and then
669:00 - we're gonna add The Styling so
669:03 - underneath this H5 let's add a P tag and
669:07 - I'm going to go and say item dot
669:10 - description
669:12 - like this okay
669:14 - again you won't really be able to see a
669:17 - lot of this stuff here okay there so at
669:20 - least so I commented out the image just
669:22 - so you could see all of this and you can
669:24 - see that I'm dynamically pulling all of
669:26 - this from that Json that I had okay
669:30 - right there let's go button we'll go
669:34 - follow okay so now that button is
669:36 - showing up that's good
669:38 - good all right that looks great now
669:41 - let's get out of here and we're going to
669:44 - add another button and this will give it
669:48 - a class name of style dot show more
669:52 - excited to show more people and we're
669:55 - gonna go down outlined
669:58 - boom
669:59 - all right so that's where we're getting
670:01 - that down arrow from right there okay so
670:04 - now I think we can um add in a bunch of
670:09 - uh
670:10 - styling so let's go to our Explorer
670:13 - module CSS explore whoops explore
670:17 - module.css and let's start working on
670:20 - our styling it's going to be quite a bit
670:23 - of styling here okay so let's go explore
670:25 - container add some padding let's add
670:28 - height 100 percent
670:30 - okay uh overflow Auto
670:33 - and let's do padding top 5.2 em okay
670:41 - so the padding is now showing up I'm
670:44 - going to add my images back okay so now
670:47 - after
670:49 - I did overflow Auto you saw that at
670:51 - least it allows me to scroll
670:53 - automatically Up and Down based on how
670:55 - much content we have on the screen
670:58 - now I want to definitely control the
671:00 - images here because they're a little
671:02 - ridiculous so let's go head image with
671:06 - 15 pixels let's just control it
671:08 - interesting that does not control it yet
671:11 - okay let's go uh position absolute
671:17 - left zero top 50 percent transform
671:24 - Translate Y negative 50 percent
671:28 - okay I said refresh
671:30 - okay so it's not doing all right so
671:33 - before actually we add this styling in
671:36 - right let's comment this out for now
671:38 - we're going to save this for later but
671:40 - let's go and add this show more people
671:44 - um card as well
671:46 - okay so let's go and style uh that so
671:50 - let me let me go to so or explore
671:54 - container we're adding some padding to
671:56 - it that made that made some change
671:59 - now let's style our people to follow so
672:01 - anything with an H6 okay so let's go
672:04 - explore a container I'm gonna go H6 on
672:07 - this thing and we'll go font size
672:10 - like that
672:11 - okay we'll go padding actually let's go
672:16 - um font weight 500
672:20 - color
672:22 - beautiful and then margin 1.5 em
672:26 - okay
672:28 - so it gives it that little gray color
672:30 - right there now let's work on the show
672:33 - more so show more I'm gonna do display
672:37 - Flex
672:39 - okay we're gonna show more
672:41 - show more people it's a little hard to
672:43 - see but it's still uh still there
672:47 - okay and let's control the images as
672:51 - well so I'm going to do um
672:54 - Let's go people container image
672:58 - let's go with 40 pixels border radius
673:03 - 1.1 am
673:05 - okay so that controls the images so the
673:07 - images don't look freaking crazy now
673:09 - let's come to show more where we were
673:11 - working and let's add more uh more
673:14 - things to this okay so this show more
673:16 - people okay so for example if I do
673:18 - border
673:19 - none
673:21 - you'll see that the Border
673:23 - um The Border kind of vanished okay so
673:25 - those are some examples of what we can
673:27 - do to this but let's remove that for now
673:28 - let's go align items I'm going to go
673:30 - Center
673:31 - position absolute
673:35 - bottom I'm going to go negative 14
673:38 - pixels on this thing
673:40 - okay so it moved it all the way down
673:42 - left 50 percent left oops
673:48 - okay and then we can do translate X
673:51 - probably negative 50 if we wanted to so
673:53 - let's go transform
673:55 - translate x negative 50 so this is one
674:00 - hack of how you can like Center align
674:01 - things
674:02 - let's give it a background color
674:06 - and I'm gonna go with an F4 F4 F4 okay
674:10 - and we're going to make that an
674:12 - important one so it overrides any other
674:14 - styling that this card has
674:17 - okay
674:18 - cool
674:20 - other things I want to do is border none
674:23 - and let's give it important
674:25 - so now that border is gone
674:27 - give it a color font color of this
674:31 - and I'm going to go important cool so
674:35 - again it's a little hard to see for you
674:37 - but it's there at the bottom okay so for
674:40 - you it should be there just chilling at
674:42 - the bottom a little hard to see okay
674:45 - like right there on my screen
674:49 - and box Shadow I'll give it zero pixels
674:56 - my bad it probably exploded your ears
674:58 - sorry about that okay so that adds a
675:01 - nice little box Shadow on this thing and
675:03 - what can we do to make sure we see it
675:06 - right so let's go show more people
675:08 - I'll go H2 dummy
675:12 - text
675:14 - all right so because we've done so dummy
675:17 - text is showing above that because we've
675:18 - done position absolute I believe right
675:21 - so that's why
675:23 - that's showing at the bottom otherwise
675:24 - it would show right here okay but
675:26 - because of position absolute it's making
675:28 - sure it's all the way at the bottom
675:31 - okay so I can change the
675:35 - the negative 14 PX okay I can bring that
675:38 - later just so you can see how it's being
675:39 - styled right now
675:41 - and then we can go font weight
675:45 - 500
675:46 - and let's go important
675:50 - all right
675:52 - okay
675:54 - and let's go show more
675:58 - span and we'll go font size
676:00 - okay
676:02 - margin let's give it a little bit of
676:04 - margin for from the top so 0.4 em should
676:07 - be good beautiful and then of course
676:09 - let's give it some margin from the left
676:11 - 0.5 VM
676:13 - all right so now this button is starting
676:16 - to look much much much better right
676:17 - we've got some margin here we got some
676:19 - margin there all right so let's go down
676:22 - and um we're gonna add
676:25 - um
676:26 - we would do stuff with the header but
676:28 - let's go ahead and do that maybe
676:31 - um
676:32 - we could do that a little bit later or
676:34 - we could do a little bit of that now
676:36 - trying to think I think the header stuff
676:39 - let's do it just a little bit later
676:42 - okay
676:44 - for now let's just work on the people
676:46 - container that we have okay so I'll get
676:50 - started here
676:51 - so let's go people container
676:54 - and I'm going to give it a background
676:56 - color for that so that's highlighting to
676:59 - you where the people container is and
677:02 - where it starts and all of that
677:04 - let's give it a margin of
677:07 - negative 0.5 em
677:11 - beautiful we'll give it some padding
677:14 - cool and then make sure the position is
677:18 - relative okay
677:21 - and show more people is right there
677:23 - great okay if I added that little uh
677:27 - bottom negative 14 pixels at the bottom
677:29 - of that
677:30 - that would put the show more people
677:32 - right here
677:34 - okay
677:35 - beautiful
677:36 - that's because
677:38 - this is relative and if I remove this
677:40 - now it just vanishes okay so that's the
677:43 - trick we use we make the parent
677:45 - container relative and the child
677:46 - container absolute and so then it just
677:49 - stays within that
677:51 - all right so let's grab the people
677:53 - container again let's grab a div inside
677:55 - of it I'm going to do display Flex we'll
677:58 - align items Center so vertically align
678:01 - it we'll justify content space between
678:04 - so things are evenly spaced out so we
678:07 - got our text here we got the image here
678:09 - we got the follow button
678:11 - and let's give it a margin bottom
678:14 - beautiful
678:17 - let's go down let's go and add an H5 to
678:23 - this thing styling for H5 for the text
678:26 - color let's just make it the regular
678:29 - color that we use for Clubhouse okay
678:32 - let's refresh
678:34 - okay great so look at the font keep
678:38 - watching it let me uncomment it and boom
678:41 - the font size became a little bit
678:43 - smaller all the h5s became a little bit
678:45 - smaller and then let's give it a margin
678:48 - bottom of 0.2 em
678:51 - okay
678:52 - that looks good
678:54 - let's go here and let's get into the P
678:57 - tag so the P tag we're going to do a
679:00 - little bit of styling here so let's
679:02 - start off with the color
679:05 - first so I'm going to put this for color
679:08 - font size let's go 0.9 em
679:12 - okay
679:13 - so we're making the font size a little
679:16 - bit smaller again refresh if you don't
679:19 - see any differences let's remove any
679:21 - margin we have so again all of those
679:23 - come together a lot closer
679:26 - display I'm gonna do block
679:30 - and
679:32 - let's go with
679:35 - 173 pixels
679:37 - okay and I'll also do display
679:40 - uh webkit box
679:43 - height I want to do fit content okay
679:46 - let's hit refresh
679:49 - good
679:51 - line height
679:53 - and that goes ahead and just shrinks it
679:55 - a little bit okay that's why we add that
679:57 - line height there
679:59 - all right so what I want to do here is
680:02 - it's going on for four lines I want to
680:05 - make it so it only comes to two Okay so
680:08 - I'm gonna do webkit line clamp on this
680:11 - thing and let's go with the clamp of two
680:15 - let me hit refresh save
680:18 - okay interesting all right so now let's
680:21 - keep on styling this thing so I'm going
680:24 - to also
680:25 - um throw so this clamp is going to make
680:28 - sure that it's going to be
680:29 - um on two lines okay so you'll see what
680:31 - I mean in just a little bit let's also
680:33 - throw on a I'm gonna Orient this
680:36 - vertically let's go overflow hidden on
680:41 - this okay and I'm going to do text
680:44 - overflow ellipses so that's going to put
680:48 - the little dots if it can't read anymore
680:50 - and then last thing I'm going to do is
680:52 - I'm going to color it like that all
680:55 - right let's make sure we hit refresh and
680:58 - that's looking pretty good okay
680:59 - beautiful oops misspelled that let's
681:01 - spell it Orient like that save cool all
681:05 - right so Watch What Happens right if I
681:07 - remove the or that look what it does if
681:10 - I remove the Overflow hidden it will
681:12 - have this like overflow hashtag a Naj
681:16 - Cass whatever right so if I remove that
681:19 - overflow or if I add hoverflow hidden
681:22 - then it will take care of that if I take
681:24 - out the ellipses okay so let's go so
681:28 - ellipses will actually help the text if
681:30 - we ever have overflowing text it's just
681:32 - going to end it with the ellipses all
681:35 - right and then we're going to do people
681:36 - container let's go and add a button and
681:39 - in this button I'm going to say
681:41 - background color and let's go
681:43 - transparent on this button okay border
681:45 - I'm going to give it a solid okay let's
681:49 - give it a button background color so now
681:53 - this follow button is starting to get
681:55 - styled if I remove the transparent look
681:58 - how it has that like gray color and then
682:00 - as soon as I go transparent it gets the
682:02 - color of whatever is behind it okay
682:04 - let's give it a border radius of 2 em so
682:09 - now we got nice rounded Corners there
682:11 - let's give the font
682:14 - our color button background color
682:17 - okay so now it'll also have that blue
682:19 - that just bolds it up a little bit
682:23 - dope and then let's go padding 0.1 em
682:28 - and 1.2 am okay so now that padding
682:33 - makes it look really freaking cool okay
682:37 - and that button is looking kind of how
682:39 - we want it and now we want to have
682:41 - conversation cards okay we want to style
682:44 - them as well
682:46 - but we're going to do that next all
682:49 - right so let's add the conversation
682:50 - section in Explorer and that's going to
682:54 - be quite simple so I'm going to go to my
682:56 - Explorer and right underneath let's find
682:59 - where our H6 is at and right underneath
683:03 - this div ending here we're going to add
683:06 - another div actually let's not add
683:08 - another div okay what I'm going to do is
683:11 - let's start off with H6
683:13 - and this is going to be find
683:15 - conversations let's go
683:18 - conversations about just like this okay
683:23 - I'm going to delete this
683:26 - and let's go ahead and actually paste it
683:30 - within this div right here okay let's
683:34 - put that inside of that div otherwise I
683:35 - was complaining okay so now you see this
683:37 - thing that says find conversations about
683:39 - blah blah blah okay so what we're going
683:41 - to be working on is this thing right
683:43 - there find conversations about and right
683:46 - underneath this let's go and put
683:48 - ellipsis like this right underneath this
683:51 - I'm going to have last name and I'm
683:54 - going to do row so this is like margin
683:56 - horizontal of zero
684:00 - okay and then within this div I'm going
684:04 - to get access to my conversations and
684:07 - loop through them like this okay and
684:10 - again we're just going to be returning
684:12 - an expression so let's go div and this
684:15 - div will have a class name of we'll go
684:18 - column six and margin bottom
684:22 - three cool
684:24 - actually no this is probably not what we
684:27 - want let's grab from here okay and I'm
684:31 - going to cut this
684:33 - all right and let's actually move that
684:36 - below this button right here so I'm
684:40 - going to go below this button and let's
684:41 - go underneath this div and I'm going to
684:44 - paste this here okay that way to find
684:47 - conversations about is going to happen
684:48 - here because otherwise it was really
684:50 - messy how it was happening there now
684:52 - let's go create another div and I'm
684:54 - going to give it a class name of
684:57 - style.conversation card and here we're
685:01 - going to have another H6
685:03 - and I'll do fire outlined just like this
685:06 - hopefully we've imported that have we
685:09 - not imported that okay it goes we have
685:11 - not imported that so we will go and
685:14 - import that um oh actually maybe it's a
685:17 - line with the small L nope we still have
685:19 - not so let's go and do that fire
685:22 - outlined
685:24 - like this
685:25 - all right
685:27 - so far outlined is not defined refresh
685:32 - okay so we got our fire icon showing up
685:35 - that's a good sign and I'm going to do
685:38 - item dot title nice okay that's good and
685:43 - then let's go underneath this we'll add
685:45 - a P tag and we'll just go item give me
685:48 - the description of the item boom did I
685:51 - misspell a descript description so
685:54 - somehow the description is being added
685:56 - but it's somehow invisible okay item dot
686:01 - description let's add it there okay so
686:04 - we're gonna fix that in a second let's
686:06 - keep going for now
686:08 - oh I think it's because I actually
686:11 - misspelled description and I spelled it
686:13 - description like this so that's really
686:16 - where the error is happening from so
686:18 - it's yeah so
686:20 - everywhere all right let's do command um
686:23 - let's do command D and let's go actually
686:28 - wait why did it not select every single
686:30 - one of those
686:32 - command D huh that's interesting I don't
686:35 - know why it's not selecting all of them
686:38 - change all the currencies
686:40 - let's go description so now that'll fix
686:44 - that typo that I had we can change this
686:46 - with description and boom there we go
686:49 - okay so that is all good now let's go
686:54 - ahead and add the styling for this um
686:57 - component okay so let's go into our
687:00 - explore
687:02 - module.css and we will add The Styling
687:05 - for our conversation cards now so
687:07 - conversation card and I'm going to go
687:10 - and give it a background color of white
687:13 - okay we're gonna of course give it a
687:15 - border radius and I'll give it those
687:17 - nice rounded Corners good
687:22 - let's give it some padding okay
687:26 - and then let's give it a box shadow
687:30 - that looks pretty
687:33 - all right
687:34 - beautiful
687:35 - so this is looking really really good so
687:38 - far okay and again if you're enjoying
687:40 - this and you love this do consider our
687:44 - course uh profit with JavaScript because
687:46 - in that course we're gonna go way deeper
687:49 - because here you're following along with
687:51 - me you're learning this you're having
687:53 - fun you're building something that's
687:54 - actually really powerful but there are a
687:56 - couple of things where you're like how
687:58 - what are the basics behind this right so
688:00 - sometimes when we're building these
688:02 - clones we might not be able to go into
688:05 - deep down nitty-gritty of everything
688:07 - because otherwise this maybe five six
688:09 - hour long tutorial would actually be a
688:11 - 20 hour 40 hour long tutorial right so
688:13 - we take all of those Basics we put them
688:16 - inside of the program so then you
688:18 - yourself can build apps like this from
688:21 - scratch without having to necessarily
688:24 - follow along on this coding tutorial
688:27 - okay so if that's something that
688:29 - actually interests you and excites you
688:31 - then definitely click the link below and
688:33 - jump inside a profit with JavaScript
688:35 - okay this is the best community in the
688:38 - world of developers you get three
688:41 - coaching calls per week so the coaching
688:43 - calls are absolutely so valuable you
688:46 - have 20 plus hours of content around
688:48 - react JS all right so it's brilliant and
688:53 - you're going to be building tons of real
688:55 - world projects inside of that course
688:57 - okay so if you're enjoying this so far I
688:59 - would highly recommend to consider
689:00 - joining that course and I would love to
689:02 - see you you inside okay that's it that's
689:05 - it let's get back into this all right so
689:08 - um let me go ahead and do a couple of
689:10 - things here so I'm going to do
689:11 - conversation cards and let me grab the
689:13 - H6 okay and I'm going to set the color
689:17 - to our regular color that we have okay
689:20 - for the fonts and I'm going to give it a
689:24 - font size of one em okay so that made it
689:26 - just a little little bit bigger in this
689:28 - case let's give it a margin of zero okay
689:31 - so there's no margin that's why
689:33 - everything just squished up and we're
689:35 - gonna go display Flex beautiful okay so
689:39 - let's take out that line let's say
689:41 - display Flex everything is
689:43 - working nicely and we will do align
689:46 - items Center beautiful and now let's go
689:51 - grab the span tag inside of the H6 and
689:55 - I'm going to give it a little margin
689:57 - right and we will go 0.2 em beautiful
690:01 - let's
690:02 - um now grab the P tag in conversation
690:05 - let's take away any margin in there as
690:09 - well okay so now you see it's made it
690:12 - significantly smaller we're going to
690:15 - make the color maybe a little bit Gray
690:17 - let's give it a line height of 1.2 dope
690:21 - and then font size of 0.8 am
690:26 - nice that looks beautiful look at that
690:31 - so now our explore page is looking
690:33 - looking as good as it can be right this
690:37 - is a really solid looking explore page
690:40 - it looks juicy it makes you want to
690:43 - click on it and see what else is
690:44 - happening okay so great job on this and
690:49 - of course let's add our header as well
690:51 - okay so we're gonna add our header and
690:54 - our sub header so let's go to our
690:56 - Explorer and let's start with adding our
690:58 - header okay so we're going to need a
691:01 - couple of things um let's do import
691:03 - input oops input like this from Ant
691:09 - um ant d
691:11 - and outside of this let's start working
691:14 - on our header okay and we're going to
691:16 - add our header pretty much at the top so
691:19 - let's go div here and I'm going to go
691:22 - class name
691:23 - and this div here will be style.header
691:27 - okay and then inside of here I'm also
691:31 - going to have a sub header okay so I'm
691:34 - going to table that for now but we will
691:37 - add it later so I'm going to comment
691:38 - that out just for now there and then
691:41 - let's put our input that we got from
691:43 - anti the input component
691:45 - we go style of that input will be the
691:49 - following will have a background color
691:52 - of that so now our input is showing up
691:55 - and that's the background color okay if
691:58 - I remove that I mean looks pretty much
692:01 - the same to me so that's good uh do we
692:03 - need to be oh we out yeah Okay cool so
692:08 - we got our background color here let's
692:10 - go ahead and add a border radius 0.8 em
692:15 - oh duh so style is misspelled it's
692:19 - styled like this lowercase okay so now
692:22 - there we go we got our style going okay
692:25 - and I can see it now so that border
692:28 - radius is now coming through as well if
692:29 - I remove it okay boom and now let's add
692:34 - a couple of more things here so let's go
692:36 - padding and we're gonna go 0.3 Em by 1
692:40 - em so now it's gonna become a little bit
692:43 - bigger like this I'm going to add border
692:45 - of none okay beautiful so now it's
692:48 - looking much cleaner and then we're
692:50 - gonna go box Shadow and we'll go none as
692:54 - well so let's hit save okay now it's
692:58 - it's there and it's doing what we want
693:00 - it to do great all right so now let's do
693:04 - a couple of more things uh what I want
693:06 - to do here is let's give it a size of
693:10 - large large input okay and then I'm
693:14 - going to give it a placeholder of find
693:17 - people and clubs
693:20 - so now that placeholder is right there
693:22 - and then let's give it a image whoops
693:25 - image tag weird let's go image source is
693:30 - equal to Images slash search dot PNG
693:32 - like this okay we're gonna close it and
693:36 - then let's go ahead and give it a width
693:38 - of 15 pixels like that and let's hit
693:43 - refresh okay great so we got our image
693:47 - up here and so so we're good to go right
693:50 - we got what we need we got what we came
693:53 - for and our search is showing up at the
693:56 - top good
693:57 - now can we make it look better yeah
694:00 - probably we can give it some styling and
694:02 - that should help us make it look better
694:04 - okay so let's go back to our my explore
694:08 - module CSS explore module CSS right and
694:14 - uh let's go add some stuff about a
694:16 - header okay so let's go header and I'm
694:19 - gonna go position absolute great we'll
694:22 - go left zero will go right zero and
694:27 - let's hit refresh okay great and let's
694:31 - go uh top zero cool so now boom all the
694:36 - way at the top let's give it a
694:38 - background color the clubhouse color
694:40 - great
694:42 - did I write that right f2f0e4 yeah I did
694:45 - all right let's give it a z index of
694:48 - five on this just so like we make sure
694:51 - it always stays on top it doesn't really
694:52 - go behind anything and I'm going to give
694:54 - it a padding of 0.5 em okay so that
694:58 - pushed it out a little bit from those
695:00 - top the top part because otherwise it
695:02 - was too close to it and one more thing
695:04 - to be to keep in mind why this is not
695:08 - showing the anti design and it's kind of
695:10 - just showing a random design is because
695:12 - we need to duh go inside of our index.js
695:16 - and actually import it
695:19 - um right here okay so we're going to do
695:20 - anti dist and D dot CSS so once we
695:25 - import this give it some time to load
695:27 - and hit refresh and now it's going to
695:30 - import that design and it looks much
695:33 - better than it did earlier now we're
695:36 - gonna work on the sub header component
695:38 - which is this one right here so that
695:39 - Explorer with the back button on the top
695:42 - so how do we add that well first of all
695:44 - we need to actually go and create a new
695:46 - component so I'm going to go inside of
695:48 - my components right right click here new
695:51 - file and we're going to go sub header
695:53 - .js like this and inside of here let's
695:57 - start off with a couple of things import
696:00 - react from react that we need import
696:02 - style from
696:04 - style slash
696:07 - explore.module.css okay we already have
696:09 - that file so we're good to go and let's
696:12 - just create the component for now let's
696:15 - make sure we spell this right sub header
696:18 - and I'm going to just give it a H2
696:21 - actually let's go return and let's go H2
696:25 - sub header like this and then let's go
696:29 - to our explore.js and
696:32 - make sure that we can actually read it
696:34 - and it says sub header is not defined so
696:37 - let's go sub header let's go like this
696:40 - okay sub header hit enter it'll Auto
696:44 - Import it at the top just like this and
696:46 - now we got our sub header
696:48 - being imported great now those go to our
696:51 - subheader component and we're going to
696:53 - start start creating this
696:56 - so open close parens because this is
696:58 - what we're going to be returning
697:00 - and we're going to do a couple of things
697:03 - so let's go ahead and do H3 and
697:07 - what I can do here is put the page title
697:10 - okay so I can kind of hard code the page
697:12 - title to like for example I can just say
697:14 - explore like this and it's going to just
697:16 - say that at the top but we want we would
697:19 - rather have it be passed in from right
697:21 - here from the subheader component right
697:24 - so like that's what we would want to
697:26 - preferably do
697:28 - so let's go ahead and do that now so
697:31 - this H3 instead I'm going to replace it
697:34 - with
697:35 - props.page title
697:37 - like this
697:39 - all right and I wanted to show me that
697:41 - now clearly that's not there as of now
697:44 - but I can actually give it that so I can
697:47 - give it page title equals something so
697:49 - let's just go page title like this
697:51 - equals
697:54 - and I'll go subheader boom or explore
697:59 - booms right there
698:01 - okay
698:02 - and oh it's called deconstructor right
698:06 - so for example we could use
698:07 - deconstruction over here instead of
698:09 - using props so like for example I could
698:12 - do page title because we know we're
698:14 - going to be receiving that and I could
698:16 - get rid of props if I wanted to
698:20 - right but props just makes it easier for
698:22 - us to deal with it we can give it like
698:25 - any number of arguments okay it's a
698:29 - little crash course for you now let's
698:32 - actually start styling this a little bit
698:34 - okay so let's add a div
698:36 - okay let's remove the whole thing for
698:38 - now let's add a div and I'm going to
698:41 - give it a class
698:43 - name of style dot head
698:47 - okay and we're going to create that
698:49 - style file or styling for that in a
698:51 - little bit
698:52 - I'm also going to create a link to the
698:55 - home page now you might see that there
698:59 - is a problem here
699:02 - oh I mean first of all let's obviously
699:04 - open close this in parens otherwise that
699:07 - code will be forever unreachable now we
699:10 - we still need to import link because it
699:12 - says link is not defined so let's go
699:15 - ahead and do that import I'm going to do
699:18 - import
699:19 - link
699:21 - let's go like this I'm going to need
699:23 - with router as well and Link from react
699:26 - router dump
699:28 - great okay now within this link I can
699:32 - make it anything I want okay so for
699:35 - example let's refresh this and this
699:37 - h-e-e-e can be a link to a home page I
699:39 - click it it takes me to the home page I
699:41 - click here I go back to the explore page
699:43 - but instead of a he what I'm going to
699:47 - make it instead is I'll make it make it
699:49 - an image and we'll go Images slash
699:52 - arrow.png okay not so pretty so what
699:57 - I'll do is um I will
700:00 - try to go style it and make the image a
700:05 - little bit smaller right so for example
700:06 - we can go to explore.js
700:09 - I can
700:10 - grab my head and any images inside of it
700:13 - and we can give it a width of 15 pixels
700:17 - okay and now it's just there at the top
700:20 - so that's just to like kind of control
700:22 - that image so it doesn't
700:24 - explode on our face alright so that link
700:28 - is good now while we're still in this
700:31 - div we're going to do a couple of more
700:33 - things let's give it an H3 okay and
700:36 - we're going to do props.page title what
700:40 - we did earlier
700:41 - and now it will show us that explore at
700:44 - the top so that looks good to me
700:46 - actually it looks like this page is good
700:48 - let's hit explore again this looks good
700:50 - to me I don't we don't need this it's
700:53 - not being used so you know it's not a
700:55 - good practice so leave that in there and
700:57 - let's throw that out now let's go to and
701:01 - work on adding a profile page so for
701:05 - example when I click this it takes me to
701:07 - this profile page let's add that
701:10 - okay
701:11 - so I'm going to go to
701:14 - um let's see where should we start so
701:16 - let's just go to our app.js for now and
701:19 - in my app.js I'm going to do a couple of
701:21 - things we're going to get an error but
701:23 - that's okay so let's go import profile
701:25 - from Pages slash profile and I want to
701:31 - add the path here so I am able to route
701:35 - to it we'll do profile and of course I
701:38 - want to be able to route
701:40 - to that component so in my component I'm
701:44 - going to add profile now my app is going
701:47 - to complain I don't know what that
701:49 - component is or what that page is so
701:52 - let's go ahead in our source and we'll
701:55 - go and in our pages right click and we
701:58 - will hit create a new file and it'll be
702:00 - called profile
702:02 - dot JS and in here
702:05 - we will do everything we need to do to
702:08 - be able to see our profile okay let's go
702:12 - finish the styling for this Explorer
702:15 - okay so let's go to our explore module
702:17 - CSS for a second and
702:20 - um
702:21 - I'm going to go to head
702:24 - all right and we're going to text align
702:26 - it to Center
702:27 - so that takes the whole thing to the
702:29 - center let's add padding let's add
702:33 - position relative and we'll do margin
702:36 - bottom the things underneath it there's
702:38 - some margin there okay cool and then
702:41 - let's make sure that we play with the
702:43 - image and control it better so going to
702:47 - give it a position absolute okay so the
702:50 - image was the thing that was actually
702:52 - pushing the whole thing down now I've
702:54 - just said hey position absolute so it'll
702:56 - just be like Splat on top of anything
702:58 - and then I'm going to kind of position
703:00 - it right there so we can give it a left
703:02 - of zero pixels
703:04 - we can give it a top of 50 percent and
703:07 - then we can transform and Translate Y
703:12 - and we can do negative 50 like this okay
703:16 - and again that's a trick for centering
703:18 - okay so you could do
703:20 - this trick for centering things
703:23 - horizontally you could also use this
703:25 - trick to Center things vertically let's
703:27 - go here and we're going to go
703:30 - um we do we have an H3 here actually I
703:33 - think that's an H3 right what is
703:35 - Explorer yeah that's an H3 so we can
703:37 - grab that let's give it a margin of zero
703:40 - and then we will give it a maybe a
703:43 - smaller font size like 1.2 okay good so
703:46 - now I can see everything I can see
703:48 - explore I can see people to follow my
703:50 - left arrows there I can click into this
703:53 - okay that's looking good I am definitely
703:57 - happy uh I'm definitely happy about that
704:00 - and
704:01 - do we even need this H6 oh yeah yeah
704:04 - yeah we do we do for the people to
704:06 - follow okay fantastic good progress so
704:09 - far all right so our app is complaining
704:12 - right like for example if we go to the
704:13 - home page it works if I go to the
704:16 - explore page it works but if I go to the
704:18 - profile page when I click on that face
704:20 - it goes huh
704:23 - what what's happening well let's work on
704:27 - that okay so um
704:30 - look we uh let's go to our app.js right
704:34 - we imported profile but when I go inside
704:37 - of profile it's kind of empty right and
704:41 - there's not anything going on so let's
704:44 - go ahead and actually start working on
704:46 - our profile component
704:48 - so I'm going to go import
704:50 - react from react like this I'll go
704:55 - import
704:56 - explore style from style slash
705:00 - explorer.module.css
705:03 - whoops
705:05 - CSS okay and now I'll be able to access
705:08 - any styling within it by doing
705:10 - explorestyle Dot we name space it like
705:13 - that import style from
705:19 - there we go oh my all right
705:23 - style slash profile dot module.css okay
705:27 - now it's going to be like hey I
705:30 - attempted an import but it doesn't work
705:33 - all right and it's also complaining
705:36 - about this so what we need to do is
705:38 - actually create export default function
705:41 - and we're going to call it explore like
705:44 - this
705:45 - or no what am I doing is not explore
705:47 - profile and have it returned H2 it's
705:50 - going to say a profile like this and now
705:53 - it's going to give me a new error it's
705:55 - going to say something something about
705:56 - CSS and that's because it doesn't see
705:58 - where we got the
706:00 - profile.module.css it's like yo it's
706:02 - actually not there so let's go and add
706:04 - it profile dot module.css like so so now
706:10 - I've added it okay now it's not going to
706:13 - complain about that let's hit save let's
706:15 - hit refresh and bada bang bada boom we
706:19 - got something happening here so let's
706:21 - work on this component first before we
706:23 - do any type of styling so let's let's
706:28 - get ready to rumble all right
706:33 - so we'll go return and then in here
706:35 - let's add a blank jss jsx fragment like
706:39 - that and within this I will write my
706:43 - code so we'll have a div and I'm going
706:45 - to give it a styling of it says
706:49 - style.profile container okay and inside
706:52 - of here we'll go and have a class name
706:57 - here of Explorer style dot header okay
707:01 - it's going to borrow the styling that we
707:03 - made for our explore page that's what
707:06 - we're going to be using this for and
707:10 - um I think that's that one is good let's
707:13 - go and add another div and this div is
707:17 - going to be I can give a class name and
707:22 - what I'm going to do I'll give a style
707:25 - name using a template literal okay so
707:29 - basically what I'm going to do is I'm
707:31 - going to call it explore header but then
707:33 - attach bootstrap stuff to it so let's go
707:37 - ahead and do that so the so this one is
707:40 - going to be normal explore style dot
707:42 - head but then here's the template
707:44 - literal parts that comes in clutch so
707:46 - we're going to say text right margin
707:49 - bottom of zero nice little way of doing
707:52 - it there explore style is misspelled
707:55 - Here style all right let's hit refresh
707:58 - and we should be good to go okay so
708:01 - still an empty page but don't worry The
708:04 - Emptiness is about to end now we're
708:07 - going to throw in a link tag in this so
708:10 - when we throw that in and it gives us an
708:13 - error what we do is we need to go and
708:15 - import it so let's go import link
708:18 - from react router Dom okay now this link
708:24 - is uh going to link to maybe it allows
708:28 - us to go back to the home page
708:30 - okay so let's go to and I'm gonna say
708:33 - home just like that and inside of here
708:36 - I'll have my image
708:38 - and we'll go Images slash arrow.png so
708:42 - we got that little image if I click it
708:44 - takes me back to the home page that's
708:46 - all we got for the profile so far but
708:48 - hey it's pretty good you know why
708:50 - because it's not none it's not nothing I
708:53 - just hit command J and hit the command
708:55 - line and we're gonna do class name for
708:59 - this of
709:00 - Explorer style dot Arrow icon okay now
709:06 - this link is good that's all I wanted to
709:08 - do here let's create another div and
709:11 - we're going to give it a class name of
709:13 - style.action button okay and you might
709:17 - be wondering hey what's the point of
709:18 - this what are we going to do here well
709:20 - what we're going to do here is create
709:22 - all of these buttons right there okay
709:25 - so inside of this we're going to have
709:29 - our at sign okay so when we do that and
709:32 - it doesn't know what you're talking
709:33 - about what we need to actually do is go
709:36 - up at the top and import it so I'm going
709:39 - to go here and I'm going to say import
709:42 - BS at
709:44 - from react icons slash BS
709:49 - okay and now I got my little tiny at
709:53 - symbol okay if I zoomed in like a maniac
709:55 - it would be a big it'd be a little bit
709:58 - bigger now I also need my other things
710:02 - right I need uh my upload sign and I
710:05 - need my settings logo settings icon
710:07 - rather so let's go ahead and add those
710:09 - right so I'm going to go BS upload boom
710:12 - like this and then we're going to need
710:15 - um AI outline setting
710:18 - okay again it's complaining that it
710:20 - doesn't have those so
710:22 - let's give it them BS upload
710:25 - and that should be good and then we're
710:27 - also going to do import
710:29 - AI outline setting from react icons Dash
710:35 - AI like this and now we got all three of
710:38 - those icons
710:39 - now again as my eyes sees them as a
710:42 - designer I'm looking at oh I'll probably
710:44 - need to increase the font size in them
710:46 - and increase margin okay so as soon as I
710:50 - highlight that well that might be the
710:53 - perfect time to actually go to our
710:55 - module and just attack it right away so
710:59 - let's go get our action button right
711:01 - because this is inside of our action
711:04 - button let's attack the SVG which is
711:06 - what icons are they're svgs and I'm
711:08 - going to give it a font size of 2 em
711:10 - along with a margin
711:12 - right of one and all of a sudden these
711:17 - icons look much bigger right and they
711:20 - have a margin so that's really good it's
711:24 - really really good let's go back to our
711:27 - code that we were adding maybe we still
711:30 - need to add a couple more things
711:32 - like our image the username Harmony
711:36 - following things like that okay so let's
711:40 - go ahead and do that now let's go kind
711:43 - of
711:44 - um almost all the way down so count with
711:47 - me here this div this div this div and
711:49 - we will go right here
711:52 - and inside of here I'm going to add an
711:54 - image and this image will be of that
711:57 - user image that we had
711:59 - perfect and we'll give it a class name
712:02 - and again we're giving it a class name
712:04 - so then we can Target that class and
712:07 - style it
712:08 - okay
712:09 - so we're going to do that very very
712:11 - shortly but underneath this let's go
712:14 - ahead and give it an H4 and in this case
712:17 - I will just say rafikaze and right
712:21 - underneath that we'll add a P tag okay
712:23 - and we'll say clever cozy
712:26 - like this
712:28 - okay let's hit refresh boom great
712:32 - so that looks pretty good now again we
712:35 - just need to come into our styling and
712:37 - style up some of the stuff so let's go
712:40 - to profile module.css and I want to work
712:44 - on this image I want to grab this image
712:46 - and I want to style it so profile
712:48 - container grab the image in there with
712:50 - I'm going to give it a 80 pixel width a
712:53 - little hard to see and I'll give it a
712:55 - border radius of 2.2 em
712:58 - now the reason why that's all hard to
713:00 - see is because
713:01 - um the actual container I we didn't work
713:04 - on right so let's actually work on the
713:06 - container let's give it a height of a
713:08 - hundred percent and hit save great we
713:12 - will add overflow Auto to it
713:16 - and then we will add padding let's add
713:19 - padding top
713:21 - so we can give some
713:22 - [Music]
713:24 - some space from the top like that take
713:27 - the padding out and see padding when I
713:29 - add that padding now it's visible and we
713:32 - can see it and we'll also add padding
713:34 - all around
713:35 - so may so it's uh it's a little bit
713:38 - farther from the center and things like
713:40 - that okay let's take this padding and
713:42 - add it above padding top so let's add
713:44 - the padding first and then we'll do
713:46 - padding top 5 VM okay so sometimes in
713:48 - CSS yes the order can matter okay so
713:52 - that's why we're doing it like this now
713:55 - what I want to do is I want to grab the
713:58 - last child okay and I want to give it a
714:01 - certain I'm going to take away the
714:03 - margin so for example if you look at my
714:05 - last child here there's a margin right
714:07 - there we don't want that we want this
714:09 - gear sign to be right all the way to the
714:11 - right and these buttons will
714:12 - automatically follow so for example I
714:15 - got my gear here and these buttons but
714:18 - the gear is close to the edge of the
714:19 - screen so let's go ahead and make sure
714:22 - that that gear is to the edge of the
714:24 - screen how do we do that let's give it
714:25 - action let's grab our action button
714:27 - inside of it let's grab our SVG and
714:30 - let's grab the last child so the last
714:33 - SVG that we got let's go grab that great
714:36 - we're going to grab that and I'm going
714:39 - to give it a margin right of zero now
714:40 - don't go around grabbing random children
714:43 - okay that's not what this is about okay
714:47 - but in this case we can grab the last
714:50 - child and we should be uh legally okay
714:52 - to do so all right again hit refresh the
714:55 - disease of the browser will come to get
714:57 - you hit refresh and now it should be
715:01 - good beautiful okay what else do we need
715:05 - to work on here I want to work on some
715:07 - of my h4s but do we have h4s right now
715:10 - do we have h4s we don't so I think I'm
715:13 - going to hold off on that and um
715:16 - actually is my name in an H4 let's see
715:19 - yes it is so let's actually work on our
715:21 - H4 then so I'm going to grab that
715:23 - profile container and the H4 inside of
715:26 - it we'll go font size 1.5 em okay so
715:30 - let's make it a little bit smaller for
715:33 - color will give it the regular text
715:36 - color that we've been giving our stuff
715:38 - and then margin
715:40 - we're gonna go like this on the margin
715:42 - let's refresh okay beautiful beautiful
715:46 - beautiful beautiful and
715:48 - um we will play with the p tags as well
715:50 - do we have P tags in here yes we do so
715:52 - let's play with the P tag here and I'm
715:55 - gonna go profile container
715:57 - and we will go font size 1.1 em oh font
716:02 - eyes that's interesting font
716:05 - size okay and I'm gonna make the color a
716:09 - little gray I had tons of A's in here
716:13 - let's hit refresh that refresh works
716:17 - like magic and let's take away any
716:19 - margins we have okay great great
716:24 - so this looks pretty good now we're
716:27 - going to add maybe a couple of more
716:30 - details to the profile page like the
716:33 - amount of followers add a bio at Twitter
716:36 - at Instagram things like that okay so
716:38 - let's go back to our profile page that
716:41 - we have and let's just add those things
716:44 - to this all right so let's go right
716:47 - underneath this P tag and I will create
716:49 - another div and we'll go class name go
716:53 - style dot follow all right we're gonna
716:56 - style that so for example all of this
716:59 - follow stuff here we're gonna style it
717:01 - in a specific way so that's why I'm just
717:03 - putting a class there so I can Target it
717:06 - and play with it later inside of this P
717:09 - tag let's have a span tag and we'll go
717:11 - zero and uh zero followers okay
717:15 - starting fresh
717:17 - starting fresh
717:19 - okay so you can see the zero followers
717:22 - and that right now is kind of the same
717:25 - thing but we'll we'll make that
717:26 - adjustment later can we do this hack
717:28 - because sometimes we can do this hack
717:30 - let's see all right yeah there we go
717:32 - that's cool right
717:34 - um
717:35 - the BR the code is so smart it
717:37 - understands what we wanted it to do
717:40 - okay so we can actually write it like
717:42 - that and it looks good zero followers
717:43 - all right let's add another P tag right
717:46 - underneath it and I will have another
717:48 - span tag
717:49 - what happened there span tag will go 51
717:54 - and then we'll go space and we'll say
717:57 - following some zero followers and we got
718:00 - 51 people following Clubhouse our
718:03 - clubhouse is popping okay we're famous
718:05 - now let's go right underneath
718:07 - um this div here where it's ending and
718:10 - we're going to add a button and this
718:12 - button will say add a bio just like that
718:17 - and let's go underneath this and we'll
718:19 - go div I'm going to say class name and
718:22 - let's go margin bottom four on this
718:24 - thing and let's go inside of that div
718:26 - and I will add AI outline Twitter let's
718:30 - hit enter thank God for the first time
718:32 - in its life it decided to do an import
718:34 - now we got this Twitter icon right there
718:37 - and we will say add Twitter did that
718:41 - work hey that works that works that
718:44 - works now let's actually make this a
718:47 - button so what I'll do is let's wrap
718:50 - this up in a button okay so let's go
718:52 - button let's go underneath this just
718:54 - like that so we have add a bio button
718:57 - and then we have ADD Twitter button and
719:00 - I just want to make sure my margin
719:01 - button bottom on this button is zero so
719:04 - let's go class name margin bottom zero
719:07 - like that okay
719:09 - hit refresh cool
719:12 - as usual nothing happens
719:14 - um right underneath this button we are
719:16 - going to maybe add another button and
719:18 - that's going to be an Instagram one so
719:20 - let's just copy this instead paste it
719:23 - and uh we will say Instagram and let's
719:27 - say add Instagram okay and let's go
719:31 - right underneath this div right there
719:33 - all right and we'll add a class name and
719:37 - let's do style dot nominated
719:40 - will again get access to it afterwards
719:43 - let's throw in an image and again this
719:45 - is going to be an image of the user just
719:49 - like so right underneath the image let's
719:52 - add another div blank div and we'll go
719:55 - joined whoops okay and then this P tag
719:59 - we'll go this person joined
720:02 - um you know 14th of July 2021 14th of
720:08 - July is my birthday all right let's go
720:10 - 2020 so it's real because 14th of July
720:13 - has not happened yet and let's remove
720:16 - this for now and right underneath this P
720:19 - tag let's have another repeat tag and
720:21 - it's going to say
720:22 - nominated nominated by those span tag
720:27 - Anton Alarcon
720:30 - mixing names here all right so we got uh
720:34 - we got the image we got this now we're
720:36 - gonna style it we're gonna style it soon
720:38 - enough okay so just hold on there for me
720:41 - relax we're gonna style it very very
720:43 - soon
720:43 - let's go underneath this div right there
720:46 - and I'm going to say member oops let's
720:50 - go and say member member of all right
720:54 - and let's add a button and we'll give it
720:57 - a class name of style dot add member
721:00 - button and we're gonna do our plus sign
721:04 - for this one now it's like hey the plus
721:06 - is not defined what are you doing no
721:08 - worries BS plus and we're back in
721:11 - business okay so here's the situation
721:15 - right now I got my at my handle I got my
721:19 - followers I got a button for add a bio
721:21 - Twitter Instagram I got an image of who
721:26 - nominated me and then I can add as
721:30 - member of okay so so far so good but
721:34 - remember keep in mind this needs to go
721:35 - from looking like this which is kind of
721:38 - like crap to looking like this which is
721:40 - freaking beautiful Pixel Perfect okay
721:42 - kind of like my girlfriend so we're
721:44 - gonna make it look nice now let's go on
721:46 - from here to my uh profile Dot
721:51 - module.css
721:53 - and let's start playing with this okay
721:55 - so I'm gonna start with the follow first
721:57 - because the follow is uh not looking
722:01 - exactly how we want it so let's go
722:03 - profile container and Target that follow
722:06 - let's go display Flex on this bad boy
722:09 - cool so already it's getting in line we
722:11 - like that now let's go align items okay
722:15 - that didn't do anything let's refresh
722:17 - okay comment it out okay so we won't
722:21 - maybe add a line items Baseline and then
722:24 - let's try margin bottom let's see if
722:26 - that works all right that works that's
722:28 - good now you can just go and
722:30 - artificially give it a space as well or
722:33 - we can do it this way I can actually
722:36 - grab the first child in this okay so
722:40 - here here's a cool way of doing this so
722:42 - let's go to this one where it's a zero
722:46 - followers so where does it say that it
722:47 - says it right here right so for example
722:49 - I have this div right here now this div
722:52 - has
722:53 - um 2p tax okay now what I can do is I
722:57 - can actually get this div's first child
722:59 - so the first child would be this P tag
723:01 - and I can actually style it a certain
723:03 - way so that's something cool that I can
723:06 - do so let's go ahead and do that all
723:08 - right so let's go profile
723:10 - container
723:11 - and I'll go and Target the follow
723:14 - because it's this one right there
723:17 - and we're gonna get the first child of
723:21 - the P tags okay so let's go to the P
723:23 - tags and let's go to direct children
723:25 - I'll grab the first child and I'll say
723:28 - margin right of 2.5 em let's hit refresh
723:33 - and look at that
723:35 - right it added a margin right right
723:38 - after the zero follower right here so
723:41 - that's quite cool that's a good way of
723:43 - doing this okay so we're good on this
723:47 - end let's go and um Target our span and
723:53 - like change the font okay so font wait
723:57 - I'll start with and we'll go 500. we'll
724:00 - go color we'll give it like a darker
724:03 - black color which is the clubhouse text
724:05 - color origin right I'm going to go 0.2
724:10 - em on this so there's some margin
724:12 - between the letters there and the words
724:14 - there and let's give it a font size of
724:19 - um and again I'm playing with the span
724:20 - here so let's give it a font size of 1.3
724:23 - em like that save save refresh great so
724:29 - the font size of 0 and 51 is much bigger
724:31 - right so for example if I go
724:34 - um 3am and I hit save notice the 0 and
724:38 - 51 become big but the followers and
724:41 - following remain small and that's what
724:44 - we want that's what we want so we're
724:47 - happy okay great man my my front end
724:50 - skills are improving like crazy with you
724:52 - guys okay my front-end skills used to be
724:54 - absolute garbage now they're becoming so
724:58 - much better I'm excited thank you guys
724:59 - for being here with me doing this making
725:02 - me do this and build this for you I'm
725:04 - enjoying this just as much as you are so
725:07 - smash that like button if you haven't
725:08 - already subscribe to this channel if you
725:10 - want to keep seeing bills like this and
725:11 - if you want to boost me to make more
725:13 - builds do that right now and let's get
725:15 - back into it all right so let's go
725:19 - um grab our container and let's grab the
725:21 - Buns okay now the buttons are looking
725:22 - absolutely hideous whenever they look
725:25 - like this the first things I think of
725:27 - man I want to get rid of that background
725:28 - color man I want to get rid of the
725:32 - Border outlines right so let's go ahead
725:34 - and do that so I'm going to just stay
725:35 - border or not let's start there okay
725:37 - they're gone now they still have that
725:40 - lingering ugly color let's um so let's
725:44 - get rid of it let's go background color
725:46 - and we'll just go transparent let's hit
725:48 - save boom Blended straight into the
725:51 - background looks beautiful let's go down
725:52 - and
725:54 - um let's give the buttons a blue color
725:57 - all right the clubhouse color button
726:00 - background color like this okay now they
726:03 - look like they're clickable and then
726:05 - let's give some margin on the bottom all
726:07 - right let's go to em my bad margin
726:10 - bottom great now I don't like this image
726:12 - being that big all right so let's go and
726:15 - contain that image so let me go here and
726:18 - uh where's my image all right my image
726:20 - is under nominated so I can just go
726:22 - globally image or I can just grab this
726:24 - specific image so at a good you know
726:27 - uh good habits we're gonna grab the
726:30 - image like this and let's go with 15
726:32 - pixels for now uh what happened there we
726:35 - go oh wow it's way too small that's what
726:38 - she said let's go 40 pixels
726:40 - all right that's good and we can also
726:43 - add a border radius to it if we want it
726:45 - to and uh that makes it better okay and
726:50 - then margin write it uh by this much
726:54 - okay so if there's anything we add to
726:56 - the right which we will it'll like make
726:58 - it look good now let's just play with
727:01 - nominated uh itself and let's turn the
727:04 - whole thing into Flex let's align uh to
727:08 - the center and then let's give you a
727:10 - margin button bottom of one em margin
727:14 - bottom so the member of got some
727:18 - breathing room from it okay
727:20 - and if I remove this margin right look
727:22 - the text becomes way too close that's
727:24 - not what we want want the image and the
727:26 - text just a little bit farther away from
727:29 - it so that's good now let's uh play with
727:33 - the p tags here a little bit so let's
727:36 - grab the P tag in nominated and I'll go
727:41 - 0.975 em and then I'm going to go line
727:44 - height 1.4 so let's refresh great so now
727:49 - it's like a little bit closer together
727:51 - right
727:52 - like this see and we'll grab the span as
727:57 - well now and just Bolden it up a tad bit
728:01 - so this ant on all our cones the name of
728:04 - the person looks a little bit special
728:05 - and now let's also make it black
728:08 - okay we'll go VAR text
728:11 - color
728:12 - boom Anton all our cone pops out has a
728:17 - little bit Bolder of a weight looks
728:18 - different from the rest of the things
728:20 - and uh now let's make this uh button
728:22 - look beautiful here the plus one looks
728:25 - weird we don't like it so we're going to
728:27 - go add member button that's how we're
728:29 - going to select it because it's right
728:32 - there add number button that's the class
728:33 - we were messing around with and we'll go
728:36 - background color
728:37 - and I'm going to give it light blue and
728:39 - I'm going to say important like
728:40 - overwrite anything else that's there
728:42 - don't worry about that let's give it a
728:44 - margin bottom of uh zero and again this
728:48 - is important stuff so great if there was
728:51 - anything below it it would put get
728:52 - pushed down let's give it a padding so
728:55 - we're gonna make it a bit we're going to
728:57 - make it bigger we'll also give it a
728:59 - border radius so it starts to look more
729:00 - like this okay probably one em you know
729:04 - because if you look at the border radius
729:06 - of this and this they look very similar
729:08 - right visually so sometimes just play
729:11 - around with it and like give it a 1em
729:13 - and see what happens and hit refresh and
729:16 - like look they look they're looking very
729:18 - similar
729:19 - all right and let's go line height we'll
729:23 - go we'll go uh with the line height of
729:25 - one so that like
729:27 - did that kind of like squish it together
729:29 - yes it did right because otherwise it's
729:31 - too elongated but the line height makes
729:33 - it Go smaller so if I went 0.5 em on
729:36 - this
729:37 - um 0.5 not em but just 0.5 let's just
729:41 - keep it one for now and then margin top
729:43 - I'm going to give it 0.3 em so they'll
729:47 - push it a little bit below versus member
729:49 - up so now it looks like a nice clickable
729:51 - button and this screen looks really good
729:54 - so if we go back we got this screen
729:56 - right here we have our explore screen
729:58 - looking good we have our profile looking
730:01 - good that's a really good sign we can
730:04 - start a room we can hit let's go like
730:07 - look at all this right this is freaking
730:09 - crazy I can mute and unmute I can leave
730:13 - the room quietly and then not Dimension
730:16 - I got my like user flow right so this is
730:19 - my home page I can hit get username I
730:22 - can go to my invite page right I can go
730:26 - to this page now next next
730:28 - allow like the whole flow I mean the
730:32 - whole thing is so freaking beautiful now
730:35 - you notice this little problem right
730:37 - that we had in the start so if I go like
730:39 - this and I hit get your username it
730:42 - takes me to this page that doesn't
730:44 - really exist so that's a problem so
730:47 - let's just go ahead and see how we would
730:49 - fix that so the first thing that comes
730:52 - to my mind is well what component is
730:55 - that I think that's the welcome
730:57 - component and I think the problem is
731:00 - that I have get username and it's taking
731:03 - me to this page when it probably should
731:05 - be taking me to the invite page so I'll
731:07 - just hit save I will go back refresh hit
731:11 - get your username and now boom I'm going
731:13 - to this page done hit next next
731:16 - allow boom problem solved so again
731:19 - debugging just get calm and then start
731:23 - like you know anytime you go run into
731:25 - errors just calm and then start to kind
731:28 - of go one thing at a time don't think of
731:31 - it all at once because then it seems
731:33 - intimidating and it seems scary go
731:35 - what's the one thing what are the things
731:37 - that I do know for a fact start there
731:40 - and then work your way through it okay
731:42 - beautiful so our uh explore our profile
731:46 - is looking great most of the things are
731:49 - looking good so we could have done a lot
731:51 - more with this and we can keep going and
731:54 - here's my challenge to you okay see if
731:58 - you could make these Pages do certain
732:01 - things so see if you could play around
732:03 - with them and add more functionality to
732:05 - them okay so I'll leave that challenge
732:07 - up to you here's what my finished
732:10 - version and product looks like right
732:12 - here's the upcoming for you this is what
732:13 - it looks like look at this nice and then
732:16 - I even have a bottom sheet that comes up
732:18 - at the bottom I can get out of here I
732:20 - can go to my activity and my activity
732:22 - notifications here looks so good right
732:24 - so I'm going to challenge you to see if
732:27 - you can do that okay but currently this
732:31 - is the functionality of the app that we
732:33 - have and we have a full-on user flow
732:36 - that I just showed right so if I go to
732:38 - my home page it brings me to here which
732:40 - looks so cool I can hit get your
732:42 - username I can type in my number next I
732:45 - can allow to get the notifications it
732:47 - brings me here I can start a room and it
732:50 - can alternate between those I can hit
732:51 - let's go the loader pops up I come to
732:54 - the room I can mute unmute I can leave
732:56 - quietly I can go to my profile page and
733:00 - I can go to the explore page and see
733:02 - what's popping and even like type things
733:03 - in and of course I almost forgot one
733:07 - last piece of the puzzle which is
733:10 - deploying this app on Firebase okay so
733:14 - that's gonna still be exciting so let's
733:16 - go ahead add to firebase.com and we will
733:20 - click
733:21 - um I'll just go to my kazia clever
733:23 - programmer email you can go to whichever
733:25 - one you want of course click go to
733:27 - console and uh we're going to create add
733:29 - a project I'm going to say Clubhouse
733:31 - clone hit enter I will say Do not enable
733:34 - analytics and we will simply make sure
733:37 - that we get through this screen okay so
733:40 - now Firebase project is getting ready
733:42 - all right I'm gonna open up my command
733:45 - line and in the meantime we're gonna
733:47 - have to do Firebase in net in just a
733:49 - second so make sure you have Firebase
733:51 - tools and Firebase downloaded so let's
733:54 - go ahead and do npm install Firebase
733:58 - okay so make sure you have that if you
734:01 - have it globally then great and make
734:04 - sure you also have uh Firebase itself
734:06 - Firebase tools so yarn add Firebase
734:09 - tools and you can do again you can do um
734:12 - npm install because you if just in case
734:15 - you might not have a yarn add okay so I
734:18 - just want to make sure that I have those
734:19 - things installed and then I'm good to go
734:21 - okay let's refresh and um we're done on
734:25 - the Firebase side we just needed to go
734:27 - ahead and initialize the project and we
734:29 - don't really need to do anything else
734:30 - now again the part of deploying is that
734:33 - you're going to be able to go to blah
734:34 - blah blah blah.com and you'll have your
734:36 - site up and running okay so that's the
734:38 - great thing about doing that so we're
734:41 - gonna now make sure that we have
734:43 - everything we need uh available and then
734:46 - we deploy it and there's just a couple
734:48 - of steps to being able to do this so
734:50 - let's go ahead and do this together
734:51 - carefully so I'm going to do fire base
734:54 - in it and let's see what it asks so it
734:56 - gives us multiple choices I'm just going
734:58 - to choose hosting because I just want to
735:00 - deploy this app online so I'm going to
735:01 - hit enter now let's do use an existing
735:04 - project okay hit enter and let's see I
735:07 - see Clubhouse clone right there I'm
735:09 - going to hit enter it says what do you
735:11 - want to use as your public directory now
735:13 - this is an important part okay what I
735:16 - want to use in the public directory is
735:18 - actually just a directory called build
735:21 - so make sure to write build important
735:23 - and now it's asking configure as a
735:25 - single page app I'm going to say yes so
735:28 - I wrote Y and hit enter this I'm going
735:31 - to leave default okay good I have my
735:34 - build folder but it's not completed okay
735:36 - so now what I want to want to do is I
735:38 - want to do npm run build and hit enter
735:40 - so now it's going to create this build
735:43 - folder with all of our assets and opt
735:47 - super optimized way so this build is
735:50 - ready to be deployed in the most
735:52 - optimized way a possible okay so
735:55 - everything that gets deployed is
735:57 - actually right inside of this folder so
735:59 - that's what it's working on right now
736:01 - and it's saying creating an optimized
736:03 - production build okay so that is super
736:06 - freaking exciting
736:09 - let's go
736:11 - [Music]
736:13 - and add some music in here to make sure
736:15 - that we're good to go on this and this
736:17 - freaking bangs all right so we got the
736:21 - uh the build is good now let's try doing
736:23 - deploy Firebase deploy crossing my

745:23 - need and we're going to start from
745:25 - absolute scratch and what that means is
745:28 - we're gonna start from our command line
745:29 - okay so let's go ahead and clear out
745:31 - everything on my command line I'll make
745:33 - my screen just a little bit bigger here
745:35 - and um let's just go here and do a
745:38 - couple of things okay so I'm just gonna
745:39 - go into my GitHub folder you can go
745:41 - wherever you want okay and I'm gonna do
745:43 - npx create this is the important command
745:46 - for you to follow uh LinkedIn clone oh
745:49 - it's complaining what is it complaining
745:51 - about okay so let's go ahead in the
745:54 - start and let's try doing sudo npx let's
745:57 - see if it's a complaint about this no
745:58 - it's not okay so the complaint is that
746:02 - we need a new version all right new
746:05 - minor version available okay so they
746:07 - want us to install the new version so
746:09 - let's just take that command you might
746:10 - actually need to do this as well and now
746:13 - it's complaining so let's do sudo okay
746:15 - actually let's do this okay I'm just
746:17 - gonna do create react app okay for you
746:20 - npx probably works for me sometimes on
746:22 - this computer I have to do create react
746:24 - app for whatever reason and I'm just
746:26 - gonna do LinkedIn clone like so and
746:29 - let's hit enter and let's see what
746:30 - happens beautiful it's installing
746:32 - hopefully it's installing for you as
746:34 - well beautiful okay let's wait for it to
746:37 - finish all right great we have the
746:40 - entire app pretty much installed uh
746:42 - ready to get started could create react
746:44 - app adds in a lot of useful things that
746:47 - we need that's why this is important and
746:48 - once this is done we are actually ready
746:51 - to go ahead and get started now what I
746:53 - recommend we do is let's open up visual
746:55 - studio code okay and I'll bring that
746:57 - over here and inside of our Visual
747:00 - Studio code okay we're gonna do this
747:01 - okay I'm gonna open let's go I'm gonna
747:03 - go to my GitHub I'm gonna go to my
747:05 - banker projects here's my LinkedIn clone
747:07 - I'm just going to open that uh bad boy
747:09 - up and we're pretty much right at the
747:12 - start okay okay so let me open up my
747:14 - command line and let's go into our
747:16 - app.js this is what you should have okay
747:18 - now I'm gonna do yarn start and that
747:21 - will actually start my development
747:23 - server and let's go here and start it
747:26 - boom this is what we should be seeing
747:28 - right about now okay awesome one note
747:30 - for you by the way the if you're
747:32 - watching this
747:33 - um if when I do yarn start you can do
747:35 - npm start okay so for example if you
747:38 - don't have yarn just do npm start okay
747:40 - otherwise you'll have to install yarn
747:42 - and I'm pretty sure it's something like
747:43 - this and you can actually install yarn
747:45 - uh but you know if you don't want to get
747:47 - fancy just do npm start and you should
747:48 - be good I just
747:50 - um I just like to do yarn I'm just used
747:52 - to it now okay so your localhost 3000 is
747:54 - open uh you should be good to go now
747:56 - we're gonna do a couple of things we're
747:57 - going to delete unnecessary files okay
748:00 - so for example set up tests I don't
748:02 - really need it report this one logo SVG
748:05 - uh not gonna need that
748:08 - um not gonna need app.test JS so I'm
748:10 - holding command and I'm just clicking
748:12 - each one of these okay and now I'm just
748:14 - going to delete them so they're all gone
748:16 - okay next up what I'm going to do is
748:19 - actually pretty much every line inside
748:21 - of my index I'm going to just remove
748:23 - don't need it okay so let's just go like
748:25 - that and get rid of that okay cool so
748:27 - that's good good let's go to app CSS and
748:30 - uh inside of app CSS I also don't really
748:33 - want anything so I'm just going to hit
748:35 - command a to select everything and I'm
748:36 - going to hit delete okay and I'm going
748:38 - to hit save so now all of that should be
748:41 - gone as well and now in app.js now
748:44 - here's what's going to happen Okay so on
748:45 - the right hand side when I hit refresh
748:47 - you should see this error your error
748:48 - will be like something something
748:49 - something logo SVG complaining about it
748:52 - well it makes sense why it's complaining
748:54 - about it because you just removed the
748:55 - logo silly all right so now in our
748:57 - app.js we're gonna go and that import
748:59 - line at the top where we're look we're
749:01 - not importing the logo anymore so now
749:03 - we're just gonna go ahead and remove
749:05 - that line okay so I'm gonna delete that
749:08 - line right there and um also there's a
749:11 - bunch of stuff in this file that we
749:12 - don't need any anymore so for example
749:14 - everything inside of this div right here
749:17 - I can just get rid of and instead I'll
749:19 - just say let's build the Linked In clone
749:23 - like that okay and on the right hand
749:26 - side now it's complaining about report
749:28 - web vitals okay that's simple just go to
749:31 - index.js and remove this line there
749:34 - remove this line there where we're
749:36 - importing hit save wait for it to stop
749:39 - complaining and
749:42 - hey we're making some progress that's
749:45 - what you should be seeing right now okay
749:46 - so great job so far by the way okay
749:49 - beautiful so we got rid of all of the
749:51 - fancy styling or anything like that we
749:53 - wanna pretty much start this app as bare
749:57 - bone as humanly possible okay and kind
750:00 - of go from there so now what I'm gonna
750:02 - do is we're just going to kind of set
750:03 - like LinkedIn type of styling okay so
750:06 - first things first I'm actually going to
750:09 - take the LinkedIn image all right and
750:11 - again I'm going to drop these images for
750:13 - you guys in the link okay so you can
750:16 - grab the LinkedIn uh image from from
750:18 - this file here okay or you can just go
750:20 - online and find a LinkedIn image so I'm
750:24 - gonna go and um you know I'm gonna grab
750:27 - this LinkedIn image okay and what I'm
750:30 - going to do is I'm going to put it in my
750:31 - images public folder I'm going to create
750:34 - a new folder in here and I'm going to
750:36 - call this images so inside of your
750:39 - public create a new folder called images
750:41 - cool
750:42 - and inside of there I'm going to put my
750:45 - linkedin.png and again if you want to
750:48 - find the LinkedIn PNG very simple just
750:52 - go online type in LinkedIn PNG and you
750:55 - know again you can use the one I gave
750:57 - you or just find one from online okay
751:01 - all right so now what we're going to do
751:03 - is now that we have the image okay I'm
751:05 - gonna go inside of my um let's go inside
751:08 - of my
751:10 - index.html okay and that's also inside
751:14 - of public you have index.html and we're
751:18 - just going to make a couple of changes
751:19 - to that all right so where it says
751:21 - public underscore URL it says favicon uh
751:25 - blah blah blah we're gonna replace all
751:27 - of that and remove that and replace it
751:30 - with Images slash the image that we just
751:34 - added Linked In LinkedIn dot PNG okay
751:39 - and hit save now at the top of your app
751:42 - you should actually see the LinkedIn
751:45 - logo as your favicon okay do you see it
751:48 - beautiful okay nice and uh so that's
751:52 - good to go okay now we're gonna go down
751:55 - and uh let's go where do I want to add
751:59 - the rest of this okay so let's go ahead
752:02 - and see where it says Apple touch icon
752:04 - and here instead of this logo we're
752:07 - gonna replace this logo here with the
752:10 - same logo so let's do images slash
752:12 - LinkedIn dot PNG just like that okay
752:15 - great so we're making good progress so
752:18 - far and now let's go inside of our index
752:20 - uh index.css okay so that file is going
752:25 - to be inside of your Source directory so
752:29 - go inside of that okay index.css now
752:32 - we're going to add in a sum styling okay
752:35 - and this is going to be the common
752:36 - styling that we're going to be using for
752:38 - LinkedIn so I just decided to Splat all
752:40 - of that kind of in the start all right
752:42 - right we're going to start with making
752:44 - sure the Overflow Y is scroll okay so
752:48 - basically if we're scrolling up and down
752:50 - I want to see the scroll bar on the
752:52 - right hand side so that's what that's
752:54 - going to do and now I'm going to do
752:55 - overflow X and we're going to do hidden
752:58 - okay and what this is going to ensure
753:01 - also remember to put semicolons and also
753:03 - remember to keep hitting command s or
753:05 - Ctrl s and saving okay and overflow x
753:08 - hidden is what it's going to do is if
753:10 - we're scrolling horizontally we're not
753:12 - going to see any bars on the bottom okay
753:14 - that's what this is going to do cool and
753:17 - now let's just do a couple of things
753:19 - um to root to our body to our HTML we're
753:23 - going to add in a background color of
753:26 - the following F5 F5 F5 okay this is a
753:30 - white color the kind of color that kind
753:33 - of LinkedIn uses okay that's uh that's
753:36 - what this is going to do okay
753:38 - let's also add box sizing and I will
753:41 - just do border box here Order Box all
753:46 - right
753:47 - so that's good that's that makes it
753:50 - easier for us to like design our app
753:52 - okay and make sure that things fit kind
753:55 - of like how we want them to and it
753:56 - doesn't do anything weird Okay
753:59 - um next up we're gonna do a couple of
754:02 - things all right so now I'm gonna
754:04 - basically add some styling to things
754:06 - like H1 H2 blah blah I'm gonna just
754:08 - reset their styling so they behave in
754:10 - the way that I want them to okay so um
754:14 - let's grab our div let's grab H1 H2
754:19 - h3h4h5 H6 so all basically H Tags I'm
754:23 - gonna also throw in header in there I'm
754:25 - gonna throw in HTML
754:28 - um this tag here I'll throw in an image
754:30 - tag let's throw in label these are all
754:33 - things that we're gonna need later okay
754:36 - my bullet points Li
754:39 - nav P tag let's throw in small tag as
754:43 - well span and unordered list okay that's
754:46 - it I promise okay I know it looks
754:48 - freaking crazy looks stupid but I
754:52 - promise that's it okay now we're gonna
754:56 - do a couple of things to it so margin
754:57 - we're gonna make it zero okay that's uh
755:00 - first things first so already you you
755:03 - saw your headline go above okay because
755:05 - I removed the margin so I'm resetting
755:07 - the settings on here uh padding I'm
755:10 - going to set to zero as well okay we're
755:13 - gonna go and set border to zero of all
755:16 - of theirs cool
755:18 - outline we'll just set it to none
755:22 - okay and then um font size I'll do 100
755:26 - on these guys okay
755:30 - let's add throw in a vertical line on
755:32 - this bad boy and we'll do
755:34 - Baseline okay and background let's do
755:39 - transparent cool so you shouldn't see
755:41 - too many changes happening right now but
755:44 - what this is doing is setting us up for
755:46 - Success kind of like if your parents
755:48 - were investing into like a 401k or your
755:51 - college uh funds that we're setting you
755:54 - up for Success even though when you were
755:55 - born you had no idea what they were
755:57 - doing okay like that just buy me candy
755:59 - with that money okay what are you doing
756:01 - all right I hope you're making good
756:03 - progress so far okay now uh we're gonna
756:06 - do a couple of things guys so what I
756:07 - want to do now is first of all I want to
756:10 - focus myself
756:13 - [Music]
756:14 - okay good now what I'm going to do on
756:17 - top of that is uh let's start working on
756:19 - some of our components like our login
756:21 - component okay so login component is
756:25 - going to be our component after I sign
756:27 - out of the app so if I sign out it's
756:29 - going to be our logout login page okay
756:31 - so let's work on that so first things
756:33 - first I'm going to install a couple of
756:35 - things that I'm going to need okay so
756:37 - I'm going to need let me just open up
756:39 - another terminal thing here by hitting
756:41 - that button over there okay and um
756:44 - actually actually you know what I won't
756:47 - do that let me close that terminal just
756:49 - so you can see things clearly
756:51 - and um
756:53 - exit out of this and what I'm going to
756:55 - do is I'm going to do
756:56 - uh yarn add but you can also do npm
756:59 - install okay either one is fine I just
757:03 - like yarn better so whenever I do yarn
757:05 - add you do npm install yarn add npm
757:09 - install okay so I'm going to do yarn add
757:12 - uh react router Dom because I want to
757:16 - use react routers okay so that's the
757:19 - first thing that I need to install the
757:21 - second thing I'm gonna actually need to
757:22 - install is um style components because
757:25 - guess what we're going to be using style
757:27 - components in this
757:28 - beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful
757:31 - okay
757:33 - so we pretty much got what we're looking
757:35 - for all right we we got what we're
757:37 - looking for those are the two things
757:38 - we're looking to install and now we're
757:40 - going to go inside of our app.js okay
757:44 - um actually you know what let's build
757:45 - out our component first so let's go
757:47 - inside of our source let's add a new
757:49 - folder and it'll be called components
757:51 - like that inside of our components
757:54 - folder I'm going to create a new file
757:55 - and it'll be called login.js okay and in
758:00 - our login.js file we'll just start off
758:03 - with import style from styled components
758:07 - like so
758:08 - and then let's um add in the actual
758:12 - component okay so let's capitalize the
758:15 - name and uh we'll pass in any props that
758:19 - it needs and open that bad boy up okay
758:21 - and we'll just have it return a div that
758:24 - says login inside of it so
758:27 - pretty much not that much right now and
758:29 - of course let's export this so we have
758:31 - access to this component outside of this
758:33 - file into our other files capiche good
758:36 - so I'm going to hit save now let's go
758:40 - into our app.js file because what I want
758:42 - to happen is I want to take this
758:43 - component use it inside of my app.js
758:46 - file and then have that be displayed on
758:49 - my screen
758:50 - so now let's go to our app.js file well
758:53 - in order to use that file
758:55 - what do we need to do the first thing we
758:57 - need to do is starts with an i
759:00 - then it has an M import okay so let's go
759:04 - ahead and import uh login okay from
759:09 - um and we're going to do components
759:11 - slash login
759:12 - all right and another thing we need for
759:15 - this is we also want to start using our
759:17 - react router okay so let's go ahead and
759:20 - import all of the things we need for
759:21 - that so we're going to do browser
759:24 - router
759:25 - okay like so
759:27 - and we're gonna do as router
759:30 - okay comma switch
759:34 - um and let's do route okay so I'm I'm
759:39 - basically getting browser router switch
759:41 - and Route those are the three things I'm
759:43 - getting okay and where am I getting them
759:45 - from great question from react router
759:49 - Dom like that okay and uh that's it cool
759:53 - well now we actually gotta do our
759:56 - routing so I'm going to remove this H2
760:00 - and I'm just going to start it off with
760:02 - router and I'm going to hit tab to auto
760:04 - complete that okay inside of that I got
760:07 - my switch okay and inside of my switch
760:10 - I'm going to have my route all right and
760:13 - this route is going to be an exact path
760:15 - all right and this exact path is just
760:17 - going to be the home page okay so let's
760:20 - hit refresh it's complaining about
760:22 - something what is it complaining about
760:24 - well let's see what is the error about
760:27 - said save
760:29 - okay did we do yarn start we did not do
760:31 - yarn start so of course that's
760:32 - complaining makes total sense boom
760:37 - now let's hit restart beautiful okay and
760:41 - now you're like hey I don't see anything
760:43 - on the screen there's nothing here well
760:45 - yes because inside of Route you still
760:48 - didn't add in the login component so
760:50 - let's add in the login component
760:53 - let's ah do that
760:55 - okay this is the component we imported
760:57 - we added it there and now you see login
761:01 - okay that's it
761:03 - so we're pretty much now set to go and
761:06 - start working more on like styling our
761:09 - login component and adding more things
761:11 - to it so let's just go ahead and start
761:12 - doing that now okay great job so far so
761:15 - now let's keep rocking and rolling okay
761:16 - we got basic login component
761:19 - functionality working okay now we're
761:21 - gonna add a container and we're gonna
761:23 - start adding some nav components and
761:24 - we're going to add some styling to this
761:26 - okay so let's go ahead and do that so
761:28 - I'm going to do a few things so first of
761:31 - all
761:32 - um I'm going to find this SVG right here
761:35 - okay I'm gonna put that inside of my
761:38 - images folder so I want you to actually
761:41 - find an SVG again it's going to be in
761:44 - the comments below or in the description
761:46 - below for you so don't worry about that
761:49 - I'm gonna put it right here in my images
761:50 - okay awesome so hopefully now you got it
761:53 - in your folder let's keep on rocking and
761:55 - rolling and guys you know if you want to
761:57 - know how to stop and start your servers
761:59 - control C control C stops it okay then
762:02 - you can install whatever module you need
762:04 - to install and then you can do npm start
762:06 - so just make sure your server is running
762:09 - otherwise your app is not going to show
762:10 - up here okay just a little note
762:12 - Okay cool so now let's keep going
762:14 - through this I'm going to go inside of
762:16 - my login component and uh we're gonna
762:19 - now start adding some styling and stuff
762:22 - here okay so uh just bear with me so
762:25 - first things first okay I'm gonna just
762:27 - remove this entire line right now don't
762:29 - need that and we're going to start with
762:31 - a return statement okay and let's create
762:34 - a container component okay and inside of
762:38 - our container component let's create our
762:40 - nav component and again hit tab okay and
762:43 - then inside of our nav I'm going to add
762:46 - a link tag okay and then this link tag
762:49 - is pretty much going to do nothing as of
762:53 - now and it's just going to be the
762:55 - LinkedIn SVG logo okay that's it so
762:58 - effectively what is this going to be
763:00 - it's going to be this thing right over
763:02 - here okay just so you know where we're
763:04 - headed and what we're doing that's what
763:06 - we're building okay
763:08 - so it's going to be a link and inside of
763:11 - this link all right we're going to add
763:13 - our image tag okay so notice the
763:16 - hierarchy container nav inside of there
763:18 - we have a link and inside of there we
763:20 - have our image tag okay IMG hit tab to
763:23 - auto complete
763:25 - um from my images folder I'm going to
763:27 - get my login
763:29 - logo.svg that gets me my SVG that I'm
763:34 - looking for and now look it's
763:35 - complaining it's like I don't know what
763:37 - container is or navis make sure to keep
763:40 - hitting command desk or control s to
763:41 - keep saving okay so now what this is
763:44 - complaining about is all that means is
763:46 - we actually need our container and nav
763:48 - style styling okay so let's go ahead and
763:51 - just style them not a big deal at all so
763:53 - first things first I'm going to hit cons
763:55 - container okay and I'm going to create
763:58 - style div and I'm going to put tilde
764:01 - tilde okay tilde is the key that's right
764:03 - above tab okay and just hit save so I'm
764:06 - going to leave this style component
764:08 - empty for now
764:09 - okay and then I'm gonna create a style
764:11 - component for my nav bar so I'm going to
764:13 - do const nav and I'm going to do styled
764:17 - dot nav and I'm going to do tilde tilde
764:20 - and save and stop right there okay so
764:23 - what am I doing here I'm giving it empty
764:26 - styling okay if I do that well you
764:30 - should now have a LinkedIn clone
764:32 - okay awesome okay so now I'm gonna start
764:36 - adding some styling okay and what that's
764:38 - going to allow me to do is it's gonna
764:40 - allow me to control that image because
764:42 - that image right now is just straight up
764:44 - out of control right because you don't
764:45 - want your LinkedIn to look that freaking
764:47 - massive so inside of here I'm just going
764:50 - to hit enter enter okay and then uh
764:52 - padding I'm going to give it zero pixel
764:55 - padding okay so on the container side
764:57 - I'm done for now and inside of my Nav
765:00 - Now I want to style this okay and this
765:02 - is where it gets like interesting what I
765:04 - need to do all right so let's go ahead
765:07 - and give it a Max width of
765:10 - uh
765:12 - 11 28 pixels let it refresh okay cool
765:17 - and then uh let's go ahead and give it
765:20 - margin Auto
765:23 - okay and I'm gonna give it a padding of
765:26 - 12 pixels by Zero by 16 pixels
765:30 - okay so now we saw a little bit of like
765:33 - padding kind of kick in so it's not
765:35 - completely touching the
765:37 - the top part right of our um
765:40 - of our browser because that didn't look
765:42 - great and now we're gonna actually use
765:45 - flex so to enable Flex you got to do
765:48 - display Flex okay now you might be
765:49 - wondering hey where did it go bring it
765:52 - back don't worry we're gonna bring it
765:54 - back really soon okay just hang in there
765:55 - for me align items this is going to
765:58 - allow us to align it centrally okay this
766:01 - is vertical alignment
766:03 - and then let's go ahead and do position
766:06 - relative
766:08 - okay and um I'm gonna do another thing
766:11 - I'm gonna do justify content and I'm
766:13 - going to do space between and I'll
766:14 - explain why I'm gonna do space between
766:16 - in just a second
766:17 - [Music]
766:18 - all right and uh let's give it a flex
766:21 - wrap of no rap I don't want this to wrap
766:25 - and go to new lines because for my
766:28 - browser right if I have this nav bar
766:30 - right here I don't want it to wrap and
766:32 - then go essentially to new lines that's
766:34 - not something that I want okay so this
766:38 - is looking good so far
766:40 - and then I think I just want to do a few
766:43 - more things to make sure that we're good
766:46 - to go okay I'm just gonna say hey
766:50 - anything that's you know inside of the a
766:52 - tag do a few things with it give it a
766:55 - width of 135 pixels so now this image
766:59 - has a specific width we controlled it
767:02 - right this is what we essentially wanted
767:04 - to do now let's go ahead down and I'm
767:06 - going to give it a height of 34 pixels
767:08 - cool okay and now what I want to do is
767:12 - Media query okay so this is something
767:15 - cool that I want you guys to learn and
767:17 - what I'm saying here okay is on a phone
767:22 - this line here all that means is on a
767:26 - phone
767:27 - do the following okay so I'm gonna open
767:30 - squiggly brackets I'm just going to say
767:32 - give it a padding of Zero by five pixels
767:35 - like that okay so if we're on a
767:39 - responsive mobile device it's just gonna
767:42 - look slightly different all right this
767:45 - is going to make a big impact later on
767:48 - so with that said with the currently
767:52 - with the nav bar and where we're trying
767:54 - to place our LinkedIn clone we are good
767:55 - now let me explain why we did space
767:57 - between remember how the final version
768:00 - should look well guess what guess how
768:03 - this is separated
768:05 - because of space between
768:09 - okay and guess why it doesn't run on new
768:13 - lines Why join now is not here and why
768:16 - sign in is not here because of flex no
768:19 - rap
768:20 - okay all these little things make a huge
768:23 - freaking difference okay and you can
768:26 - play around with it you can delete lines
768:28 - and like go back and forth and see if
768:30 - that actually does anything okay and
768:32 - that's another way to like pick up and
768:35 - get better at these skills okay so let's
768:36 - keep going and by the way if you're
768:38 - wondering why your code especially
768:40 - inside of the style components doesn't
768:41 - look like mine and it's looking like
768:43 - it's just one giant long string and it
768:45 - freaks you out
768:46 - um what I recommend is go to extensions
768:48 - and you can get vs code um just type in
768:51 - style components okay and you can get
768:54 - like one of the style components
768:56 - extensions that might actually help you
768:57 - I think it's called vs code
769:00 - styled
769:02 - components that one
769:04 - so you can get that one and I think
769:06 - that'll like give you the highlighting
769:07 - you're looking for and make your things
769:08 - look normal okay I have tons of
769:10 - extensions but that's
769:12 - um one of the ones that's really helpful
769:14 - all right cool so now let's go ahead and
769:17 - add the join now button in our app okay
769:19 - and that's going to be that beautiful
769:21 - button right there and it has a couple
769:23 - of features I want to show you when I
769:25 - hover over it it has the little gray
769:27 - color that happens also notice that it
769:29 - has a nice little border radius so we're
769:32 - gonna go ahead and build that now so
769:34 - let's go ahead and do that so first
769:36 - things first I'm gonna go inside of my
769:40 - login.js I'm already here so that's good
769:42 - and then underneath this image right
769:46 - here
769:47 - uh the the login logo so go underneath
769:50 - that okay that link tag as well and I'm
769:53 - just going to open up a div and inside
769:55 - of it I'm going to create a new
769:56 - component called join inside of that
769:59 - I'll just say join now okay
770:02 - now again you should be at this point
770:04 - where it's complaining join is not
770:06 - defined
770:07 - blah blah blah blah blah okay cool well
770:11 - not a big problem now all we have to do
770:13 - is actually just go ahead and create our
770:16 - join component so I'm just going to do
770:17 - const join and let's just get started
770:20 - okay and um styled a and leave it empty
770:24 - for now save okay so now at least you
770:27 - have join now up here on the top right
770:30 - okay
770:32 - so now let's start with the styling so
770:34 - go inside of it hit enter twice and
770:36 - let's go so let's choose font size and I
770:39 - I think I'm gonna go with font size
770:42 - 16 pixels on that one
770:44 - all right so now underneath the font
770:47 - size I'm going to add a padding of 10
770:49 - pixels by 12 pixels on this thing okay
770:52 - so you can see it got pushed just a
770:55 - little bit from The Edge that's exactly
770:57 - what we're looking for uh text
770:59 - decoration
771:01 - um none because for my link tags I don't
771:03 - want them to have an underline so that
771:06 - is to just make sure that that happens
771:07 - and for color I'm gonna go with
771:12 - something like this okay just a not
771:16 - completely black it's a little bit
771:18 - grayish okay so that's what I want to do
771:21 - here
771:23 - um as a matter of fact actually what I
771:25 - can do is
771:26 - 0.08 okay so
771:30 - I think
771:32 - yeah let's leave it at this actually
771:34 - I'll 0.08 after hover okay so let's go
771:39 - here let's give it a margin right of 12
771:42 - pixels great get giving it some more
771:46 - distance from the right hand side
771:47 - because we're going to put something
771:49 - else there and then let's go ahead and
771:52 - say that on Hover we want certain things
771:55 - to happen because right now it still
771:56 - doesn't have any hover functionality
771:58 - right so let's go ahead and do that so
772:00 - on Hover we're actually going to change
772:02 - the background color and
772:04 - um I'm gonna do this to the background
772:06 - color okay so what does that mean when I
772:09 - hover over it has a lighter gray right
772:11 - so it's kind of a dark gray join now
772:13 - when I hover over it it has a lighter
772:15 - gray behind it okay cool now I'm also
772:18 - going to change the font color on Hover
772:22 - okay and I'm probably gonna what I'm
772:25 - gonna do is I'm probably going to make
772:27 - it just a little bit darker so let's go
772:30 - here boom so the font color turns a
772:32 - little bit darker as you can see and
772:35 - then let's add text decoration
772:38 - of uh none
772:41 - okay
772:43 - and all of that is looking good so when
772:45 - I hover over okay no underlines no weird
772:48 - stuff happening
772:49 - and you know one last thing is that it's
772:52 - still looking pretty Square to me what I
772:54 - want to happen is I want to give it the
772:56 - little little rounded Corners so let's
772:59 - add some border radius to this thing so
773:01 - I'm going to go border radius
773:03 - and for Border radius I'm just going to
773:05 - say hey give me four pixel border radius
773:08 - on this thing okay so when I hover over
773:09 - I got a nice little rounded corners and
773:14 - the join now button is looking
773:16 - absolutely great okay amazing we're
773:18 - doing great so far guys if you guys are
773:21 - enjoying this video by the way so far
773:22 - smash that like button break that thing
773:25 - and of course subscribe to the channel
773:26 - if you haven't already and uh let's just
773:29 - keep on going so and the one thing I
773:32 - still want to do is uh to index I want
773:34 - to actually add to our index as CSS I
773:37 - just want to add some fonts okay so
773:39 - going to
773:41 - um our body right what I want to do is
773:44 - actually just want to add a font family
773:46 - here
773:47 - okay so let's go ahead and add uh to our
773:50 - body
773:52 - okay and we're gonna add a certain
773:55 - uh fonts okay and the only fonts I
773:58 - really want to add here is font family I
774:00 - just want to add Ariel
774:02 - Ariel like this and then I just want to
774:05 - add Sans serif
774:07 - okay fall back
774:09 - and so yeah now the fonts are looking
774:12 - good kind of what we're looking for and
774:15 - with that said let's just jump in to
774:17 - start working on our sign in component
774:20 - okay that's that thing right there so
774:21 - let's go ahead and do that
774:23 - so sign and component we're going to
774:25 - need a couple of things so let's go to
774:27 - our login
774:29 - component inside of our login component
774:32 - I'm going to make our sign-in component
774:34 - right underneath the join uh the join
774:37 - button okay but it's going to be in the
774:40 - same div okay so this is important to
774:42 - understand same div the join now
774:44 - component and right underneath it we're
774:46 - going to have sign in component okay hit
774:49 - tabs to auto complete that and then I'm
774:52 - just going to do sign in okay now again
774:54 - it's complaining hey cyanide is not
774:57 - defined so same thing here you guys know
775:00 - the rules let's create a styling for our
775:04 - sign in component okay and this is going
775:07 - to be a a tag AKA link tag and then
775:11 - let's just hit save cool so what you
775:14 - should see now is you should have sign
775:15 - in on your screen if you full screen it
775:17 - you should have sign in right there
775:19 - okay and now we're gonna go inside of
775:22 - this and start actually adding this
775:24 - thing so I'm going to add a little box
775:26 - Shadow to this
775:28 - and um you know I used a box Shadow
775:30 - generator that's what you can do as well
775:33 - but here
775:34 - you're just gonna get the final version
775:37 - so we got a little box Shadow around
775:39 - this thing so you see now a blue outline
775:43 - outside of your sign in
775:46 - all right we're going to give it a color
775:47 - of
775:49 - um a little bluish color for the sign in
775:51 - as well okay and for Border radius let's
775:55 - give it 24 pixels cool so now it's
775:59 - looking nice and round that's good okay
776:01 - I'm gonna give it a transition duration
776:04 - of 167
776:06 - milliseconds okay so you're gonna see
776:08 - that's gonna come into play later on
776:10 - like for example when I hover over this
776:11 - it has a little nice
776:13 - transition that's happening there that
776:15 - takes 167 milliseconds it seems like
776:18 - just give it a font size of 16 pixels
776:20 - okay
776:22 - and I'm going to give it a font weight
776:24 - of 600
776:27 - okay so now it's a little bit Bolder
776:30 - line height give it 40 pixel line height
776:35 - okay so now boom all of this stuff got
776:39 - pushed down just a little bit
776:40 - and um on top of this I'm gonna do a
776:44 - couple of more things to this let's give
776:45 - it a little padding I think okay so
776:49 - padding I'm thinking 10 pixels by 24
776:52 - pixels like that
776:54 - okay so now sign-in component is looking
776:57 - a little bit funny it looks good here
776:59 - but on mobile mobile device it's
777:02 - freaking cut in half so it looks stupid
777:04 - so we're gonna fix that don't worry okay
777:07 - so that's our padding
777:09 - Now text align it
777:12 - um in Center
777:14 - okay and then we're gonna go back around
777:17 - color for it and background color is
777:20 - going to be a
777:23 - just that
777:24 - Okay so
777:26 - so far so good and then on Hover we're
777:30 - gonna give it some functionality okay on
777:32 - Hover
777:33 - I'm going to say that the background
777:35 - color is going to be
777:38 - let's go like that
777:40 - okay
777:42 - actually let's make it this
777:44 - one to 49 bye okay said refresh cool
777:49 - okay so now when I hover over it you see
777:53 - that there's a blue color that's
777:55 - happening okay
777:58 - and when I remove the transition look it
778:00 - just happens instantly so we don't want
778:02 - that effect I want that transition there
778:04 - because it allows me to make it blue but
778:07 - with a nice little transition on Hover
778:10 - and then on top of that I want the font
778:12 - color to change when I hover on it and I
778:14 - want it to be this blue
778:18 - uh right here on Hover okay so that's
778:22 - good and then of course text decoration
778:25 - even though right now it's good but
778:27 - let's just add this for safety and just
778:30 - good um you know default behaviors and
778:34 - patterns okay cool
778:36 - so our sign in on your computer should
778:39 - be looking good okay it's just because I
778:41 - was zoomed in like too much at 175 so
778:43 - when I meant here it looks good
778:46 - okay because I'm on a giant TV so I'm
778:48 - trying to zoom in but now you should be
778:49 - good okay
778:51 - so with that said our login component is
778:54 - looking pretty good now we're gonna
778:55 - start adding in our sections and putting
778:58 - in main content in there right now okay
779:00 - so now let's actually work on our
779:03 - section so in section basically it's
779:06 - going to be this big section over here
779:09 - okay so now we need to make that work at
779:11 - the image so it's also mobile responsive
779:13 - right because for example it's here like
779:15 - this but when I full screen it da
779:18 - completely different right
779:21 - boom and now it's here but when I go
779:24 - mobile
779:25 - the image is in the middle the text at
779:27 - the top how is that happening so we'll
779:30 - show you the magic behind the scenes
779:31 - Let's uh go to our login.js so we're
779:34 - here
779:35 - now right underneath the nav bar we're
779:38 - going to add our section
779:41 - that's going to be our new component
779:43 - all right
779:44 - all right so now of course it's going to
779:47 - complain and do our favorite complaint
779:49 - which is section is not defined okay so
779:52 - now it just means that we haven't had it
779:54 - added the styling part of this okay so
779:57 - let's go ahead and do that I'm going to
779:59 - create a section styling like this and
780:02 - it's going to be section okay save
780:06 - um cool so that's good now of course you
780:09 - know the drill enter enter inside of
780:11 - here and let's start adding what we want
780:13 - okay so first things first let's go
780:16 - align content and start whoops start
780:19 - okay now make sure let's also do display
780:24 - Flex because we're going to need that
780:26 - okay
780:28 - uh Min height I'm going to keep that at
780:32 - a 700 pixels for this thing okay
780:36 - and uh let's give it padding Bottom now
780:41 - some of the stuff you guys are not gonna
780:42 - see okay like for example padding bottom
780:46 - you're not gonna see it but what it's
780:48 - actually doing is if you added more
780:50 - content underneath this so like for
780:52 - example say section is like this right
780:54 - if I added something else underneath
780:56 - section it would start adding it from
780:59 - here but that's not what we want we want
781:01 - to give it a little padding
781:03 - so that padding that's what we're giving
781:06 - it right now okay so that's why some of
781:09 - the stuff is going to be invisible you
781:10 - can be like what the hell are you
781:11 - writing Kazi and why isn't it it's not
781:13 - doing anything but trust me it's
781:14 - actually adding padding that is good
781:17 - convention to do that
781:19 - okay uh conversely this is going to add
781:23 - padding to the top so just like this
781:25 - right now you saw it gave some breathing
781:28 - space between the nav bar and this
781:30 - section starting over here okay
781:34 - so cool
781:36 - we added pattern to the top and the
781:38 - bottom and now we'll do
781:40 - this all right
781:43 - cool so just giving it some additional
781:45 - padding
781:47 - now I'm going to make the position
781:50 - relative okay and
781:54 - um Flex wrap I'm going to actually do
781:56 - Wrap okay and the reason why I'm doing
782:00 - that is it this is the wrapping is
782:02 - what's allowing this image to get
782:04 - wrapped around which means when I do
782:06 - this it wraps it okay so that's what we
782:08 - want that means if the screen goes too
782:10 - small those things wrap and actually
782:12 - form new rows this is why Flex is so
782:15 - freaking helpful uh with we're gonna
782:18 - give a width of a hundred percent on
782:21 - this bad boy Max width is going to be
782:25 - 128 pixels okay
782:28 - align items because I want things to be
782:31 - in the center let's give it an align
782:32 - items of Center
782:34 - margin Auto okay and then of course last
782:39 - and pretty important thing is on media
782:42 - how do I want it to behave so meaning
782:44 - like on my phone on my iPhone how do I
782:48 - want it to behave this is how I want it
782:50 - to behave okay and let's give it a mid
782:53 - height mid height of zero pixels like
782:56 - this okay let's open full screen okay so
782:59 - now the section is in the middle you
783:02 - guys are going to start to see a lot of
783:04 - this Behavior once I start adding
783:06 - content to it okay it's going to start
783:08 - becoming a lot and a lot more clearer
783:11 - so now let's go ahead and start adding
783:14 - content to this thing and start adding
783:16 - stuff in our hero okay so let's go ahead
783:19 - and get our hero image so this is going
783:22 - to be our hero image that we're going to
783:23 - use right over here okay so we're going
783:27 - to put that inside of our images folder
783:30 - oh and just one fix right here guys
783:33 - um this is PX right there okay so just
783:36 - make sure you have that 768 pixels cool
783:40 - okay now let's go to our um I mean we're
783:44 - already here in our login component okay
783:46 - hopefully you're here now underneath our
783:48 - section we're going to add hero under
783:52 - um actually is going to be within our
783:55 - section okay so the hero is going to be
783:57 - within here okay so let's do this let's
784:00 - remove where we say section because
784:02 - that's not what we want anymore let's do
784:04 - hero as a component and hit Tab and uh
784:08 - just hit save so what it should look
784:10 - like is you should have section and hero
784:13 - should be inside of your section
784:16 - component okay now inside of your hero
784:20 - we're going to add an H1 and that's
784:23 - going to say
784:24 - welcome to your professional Community
784:27 - kind of like how it is on LinkedIn right
784:30 - it's save now again it's complaining hey
784:32 - hero is not defined well again that
784:35 - makes sense my friend because you know
784:38 - the deal we need to actually go ahead
784:40 - and uh make the style component for it
784:42 - so we're gonna do const hero
784:45 - style div okay do that and hit save
784:49 - so now
784:51 - we should have welcome to your
784:52 - porefessional community so let's
784:56 - um fix that welcome to your professional
784:58 - community
784:59 - great and let's just go here and start
785:03 - adding our width at a hundred percent
785:06 - why does it always auto-complete to that
785:08 - it's so silly okay and uh we're gonna
785:11 - style the H1 inside of here like the
785:14 - following okay so we're gonna give it a
785:16 - padding bottom of zero
785:19 - okay we'll give it a width of 55
785:23 - Jesus
785:25 - so welcome to your professional
785:27 - Community that's what it should be
785:28 - looking like okay and that just happened
785:30 - because of the width that I gave it cool
785:33 - all right now we'll give it a font size
785:37 - of 56 pixels like so
785:43 - Big Font that's kind of cool like it
785:46 - actually looks powerful as soon as I did
785:48 - that
785:49 - and let's give it a color of
785:54 - 2977c9 okay so this is gonna be a light
785:58 - blue font weight let's give it a 200
786:03 - font weight okay so not super thick and
786:07 - bold not Thicker Than a Snicker okay
786:10 - this is very LinkedIn e LinkedIn e vibe
786:13 - that we have here let's give it a line
786:16 - height of about 70 pixels okay great so
786:21 - that gives it some Breathing Room in
786:22 - between each line like so and
786:25 - um after line height let's add in a
786:27 - media query so we tell it how to behave
786:29 - on a mobile device okay so let's go Max
786:32 - with
786:33 - okay and this is a mobile device 768
786:36 - pixels text a line on a mobile device
786:40 - should be Center so it should be
786:41 - vertically aligned okay
786:43 - let's go font
786:46 - size to be 20 pixels all right great
786:50 - and then let's go with to be a hundred
786:54 - percent
786:56 - rate and then let's go line height
787:00 - to be about two
787:03 - great okay so this is what it looks like
787:05 - on a normal screen and then this is what
787:08 - it should look like on a mobile screen
787:10 - right in the center fits nicely looks
787:14 - great just like you
787:18 - thanks for watching so far let's keep
787:20 - going
787:21 - all right so this is good now I want to
787:25 - get outside of this H1 okay and now
787:28 - let's style the image inside of here
787:30 - because we we want to add the image and
787:32 - we want to tell it how to
787:35 - um how to behave okay so let's go uh
787:38 - above all the way here we're inside of
787:41 - our hero we added the H1 let's also go
787:44 - ahead inside of this H1 and inside we're
787:47 - gonna add our image okay so let's go
787:50 - outside of this you know correction hit
787:52 - image and how to complete that
787:55 - and um I want to pull the image that we
787:59 - added okay and it's basically login Dash
788:02 - hero.svg
788:04 - okay so now you should have the image
788:07 - showing up
788:08 - man it's already looking pretty freaking
788:11 - nice okay just make sure you didn't do
788:14 - any misspelling so like look welcome to
788:16 - your professional Community is looking
788:17 - good but this image is looking way too
788:19 - big so we need to control it that's what
788:22 - we're gonna do let's go to the bottom
788:24 - and let's go inside of our image and
788:27 - we're gonna just control this freaking
788:28 - thing okay right now so first of all
788:31 - let's give it a z index of minus one and
788:34 - while we're doing that is so if a text
788:36 - is overlapping it it's always on top
788:38 - okay image should have this image should
788:40 - not have the most priority the text
788:42 - should have a higher priority than this
788:44 - okay now with let's go 700 pixels on the
788:49 - width cool
788:51 - uh just exploded but don't worry we're
788:54 - gonna control that
788:55 - so now on full screen notice we have
788:58 - made it already smaller okay before it
789:01 - was like even bigger than this okay for
789:04 - position we're going to do absolute okay
789:08 - and then uh bottom let's go negative two
789:13 - pixels
789:14 - okay look at that
789:17 - it's like in a weird position look at
789:19 - that boom right there
789:21 - right there okay don't worry we're gonna
789:24 - take care of that right now let's go
789:26 - negative 150 pixels uh right there cool
789:31 - and um it's kind of like watching a
789:33 - painter paint you know where it's like
789:36 - not making sense and then all of a
789:37 - sudden it kind of comes together and
789:39 - your brain is blown uh apart on a phone
789:42 - how I want it to behave is top give me
789:47 - uh 230 pixels okay and then with so like
789:51 - from the top right from the top make it
789:54 - drop that's a wet you know what I'm
789:56 - talking about so like for example if I
789:58 - change this like 50 pixels right it goes
790:00 - higher up but two 30 pixels is gives me
790:05 - that nice little touch that I'm looking
790:06 - for on a mobile device but don't worry
790:08 - right now it's like kind of invisible on
790:11 - a full screen so we'll will um fix that
790:14 - as well okay but let's just make sure
790:16 - it's good on the mobile device so with
790:18 - we're going to go with initial
790:21 - and then position we're going to go with
790:25 - the
790:26 - going to go with initial as well and I'm
790:29 - going to do the same thing for height
790:31 - and I'm going to go with initial
790:33 - okay so now on mobile device it is
790:37 - looking
790:38 - beautiful okay absolutely gorgeous so so
790:44 - far so good all right folks so one of
790:47 - the problems I'm running into right now
790:48 - is my image on full screen is going
790:51 - invisible but on Mobile screen it's
790:53 - there if that's happening with you
790:55 - actually comment out the Z index minus
790:59 - one line and now your image should be
791:01 - showing up okay and you should be good
791:04 - to go so let's keep on going ahead here
791:07 - and adding more functionality to our app
791:09 - so
791:10 - I want to add in the Google form
791:12 - component okay so I want to add in like
791:14 - the Google login
791:15 - so let's go ahead and get that Google
791:18 - logo okay so take that add it to your
791:22 - images okay awesome so now after adding
791:27 - that Google SVG let's go ahead and start
791:30 - adding that to our login okay so here's
791:32 - how we're gonna do it uh let's go right
791:35 - underneath
791:36 - um actually we can keep this inside of
791:38 - the hero section right because that's
791:40 - where we want it so inside of our hero
791:42 - I'm going to add a form okay so let's go
791:47 - ahead and add that form
791:50 - um actually this form I'll probably add
791:53 - it right outside of the hero okay I
791:55 - apologize for the confusion and throwing
791:58 - you all over the place let's add form
792:00 - here okay and we're going to work on the
792:03 - styling of this form and then inside of
792:05 - here I'm going to have another component
792:06 - called Google just like that okay and
792:10 - I'm going to throw in an image inside of
792:12 - the Google component and it's going to
792:14 - be my uh Google SVG component okay or
792:19 - not component I'm sorry the SVG file
792:21 - look at the image and um right
792:24 - underneath this let's go ahead and just
792:26 - say sign in with Google like so okay now
792:30 - again it's complaining okay form is
792:32 - undefined Google is not defined
792:34 - you guys know the drill
792:37 - let's create stylings for them that's
792:39 - what it's complaining about so I'm going
792:42 - to create a form and this is going to be
792:45 - a styled div
792:47 - all right I'm gonna leave it like this
792:49 - and then I'm going to create Google and
792:51 - this is going to be a styled button and
792:53 - I'm going to leave it like that refresh
792:56 - boom we got the sign in with Google form
792:59 - all the way at the bottom you should be
793:01 - seeing that right there let me make
793:03 - myself just a little bit smaller
793:06 - okay so you can see it okay now let's go
793:09 - full screen like so
793:11 - beautiful
793:12 - looking good so far
793:14 - and can be here and be good all right
793:18 - full screen
793:20 - and uh looks great
793:23 - now inside of our form let's start
793:25 - adding styling in here
793:28 - so let's start off by giving it a margin
793:31 - top of 100 pixels start there
793:36 - so that gave it a bunch of margin and
793:39 - that's really good okay because we
793:42 - definitely want to add some margin in
793:44 - there so that way nothing weird happens
793:47 - okay and also it gives it plenty plenty
793:49 - of spacing that we want
793:51 - all right cool so that's good the other
793:55 - thing I'm going to add to my form is I'm
793:58 - going to give it a width of 400 pixels
794:00 - 408 pixels okay
794:04 - and then let's go ahead and give it a
794:06 - media query
794:08 - whoops media query I'm going to say Max
794:12 - width of
794:13 - 768 pixels which means hey I'm on a
794:16 - mobile device buddy
794:18 - on a mobile device I want you to give it
794:20 - a smaller margin top so it's not a huge
794:25 - margin top okay so you see it now it's a
794:28 - little bit closer to our image which
794:30 - makes sense which makes sense
794:33 - okay now inside of our let me actually
794:36 - all right it's in our style button let's
794:38 - go ahead and now add
794:40 - um let's basically add styling to this
794:42 - okay so let's just start with display
794:45 - Flex so we have Flex box enabled on here
794:49 - and then inside of here we're going to
794:52 - justify content and this is going to
794:54 - allow us to horizontally Center things
794:57 - so let's Center that
794:59 - I'm going to add a background color to
795:01 - this and let's just do FFF
795:05 - okay which is going to be this bright
795:07 - white that you just saw happen right
795:10 - there
795:11 - okay and um align items so I want to I
795:16 - want to Center align this thing
795:19 - okay so that's now looking a lot better
795:21 - let's go ahead and give it a height of
795:24 - 56 pixels
795:25 - so 100 width let's give it a border
795:30 - radius to give it nice little rounded
795:32 - Corners beautiful
795:35 - and now I'm going to give it a box
795:37 - Shadow that's going to be a little bit
795:39 - complicated here but again you can Auto
795:42 - generate these uh from box Shadow
795:46 - generators okay
795:48 - but just bear with me here because it is
795:51 - going to be worth it because it will
795:54 - make it look great okay I can set
795:57 - pixels RGB okay and uh let's give it a
796:01 - zero percent here okay I'm gonna just
796:04 - save this and then let's do another
796:06 - inset there
796:08 - okay and um I think I'm gonna just make
796:13 - it let's go RGB here
796:15 - and zero zero zero slash zero percent
796:20 - okay
796:21 - so
796:23 - that's a mysterious looking thing but it
796:26 - gave it the Box shadow that we were
796:29 - looking for okay without it
796:31 - we just don't have that box Shadow so
796:32 - it's not the end of the world honestly
796:34 - whether you have that or not but you can
796:38 - add that in okay if you don't want to
796:40 - write all that out I won't blame you
796:42 - if you um if you avoid that cool
796:47 - so let's do vertical align
796:51 - and let's go middle
796:53 - okay
796:54 - and then I'm gonna give it a zero index
796:57 - of zero
796:59 - let's also start adding in the
797:01 - transition duration for this because I
797:03 - want it to have a nice little effect as
797:06 - I hover over it
797:08 - okay and if font size of 20 pixels so
797:11 - now sign in with Google is looking much
797:12 - bigger
797:14 - so great and then uh I think color let's
797:18 - color it
797:20 - like so
797:21 - so that makes it just that little bit
797:23 - grayish color that is looking great and
797:28 - then now let's add in Hover
797:29 - functionality on this thing guys because
797:32 - once we have that hover then it's gonna
797:34 - do things when we hover on it does that
797:36 - make sense okay let's go ahead and do
797:39 - that guys and let's keep the freaking
797:40 - energy alive and up in here so I'm glad
797:44 - that you guys are with me and rocking
797:46 - and rolling okay if you've been if
797:47 - you've made it with us so far smash the
797:49 - like button like look at how good this
797:51 - freaking thing looks right on your
797:53 - portfolio it's gonna look so great and
797:55 - it's just gonna make you stand out from
797:57 - so many of the other people out there so
798:00 - let's keep going
798:01 - so on Hover let's basically add a
798:04 - background color changing all right so
798:07 - let's do this
798:09 - uh let's give it a 207 207
798:13 - another 207 and we're going to give it a
798:15 - 0.25
798:17 - okay
798:18 - so now when I hover it has that little
798:20 - gray color showing up in the background
798:23 - okay all right so we gave it a little
798:26 - background color now let's go ahead and
798:28 - also add a font color for this okay and
798:31 - I'm gonna give it
798:34 - um
798:35 - this color right here 0.05 so when I
798:38 - hover over it makes the text a little
798:40 - bit darker okay that's a nice little
798:43 - touch and now again we're going to add a
798:47 - little Annoying box Shadow thing with
798:48 - honestly I'm just gonna skip because I
798:51 - hate for you guys to have to type it all
798:52 - out just looks annoying it's just
798:54 - annoying so this is uh great so far I
798:59 - think this is good and I think that um
799:02 - this looks great so far so let's keep
799:04 - going
799:05 - okay so next up
799:08 - um we're going to add a couple of more
799:11 - things to this okay so that should
799:13 - complete your basic form and to sign in
799:15 - with Google and let's basically add now
799:18 - some header functionality okay so I'm
799:20 - gonna go inside of my header and this
799:23 - header is going to be on the home page
799:25 - so what does that mean if I go to slash
799:28 - home
799:29 - okay
799:30 - I want to be able to get routed there so
799:33 - this is the completely built app okay
799:35 - this is the build version the final
799:38 - deployed version and when I sign in with
799:40 - Google right when I do slash home it
799:43 - should take me to this page so now we're
799:45 - gonna actually start working on this
799:47 - page and working on this header here as
799:49 - well so let's go ahead and get started
799:52 - with that so first things first inside
799:54 - of my let's make our header component
799:57 - and then we're going to make our home
799:58 - component or let's do the other way
800:00 - let's make the home component first so
800:02 - inside of components I'm going to make a
800:05 - new not folder new file
800:07 - and this is going to be home.js and I'm
800:10 - going to do import style from styled
800:13 - components here
800:14 - all right and then I'm going to create a
800:17 - component called home
800:19 - okay and then I'm going to return div
800:23 - and let's just do home like this okay
800:25 - perfect that's all good and let's just
800:28 - go ahead and Export default home so now
800:31 - this is a component we have access to in
800:33 - other areas now let's go ahead and
800:35 - create our header component okay so
800:37 - let's go inside of components new file
800:40 - header.js just like so and inside of our
800:43 - header JS we're going to do this pretty
800:46 - much a similar thing import style from
800:48 - style components and let's create our
800:52 - header component like that give it the
800:54 - argument of props and we'll return a div
800:58 - that just has a text header inside of it
801:01 - that's it for now and now inside of our
801:03 - app.js we're just going to import these
801:06 - okay so here's what that's going to look
801:09 - like so under login we have under login
801:14 - we have this route ending we'll create
801:16 - another route
801:18 - okay create another route and this is
801:21 - going to match the path
801:23 - of home like this and then inside of
801:27 - here we'll have header
801:30 - okay let's go header let's make sure
801:33 - that in our header component we export
801:36 - default header because that's why it
801:38 - couldn't auto complete it it seems like
801:40 - let's go back
801:42 - and now I'll go header and boom it will
801:45 - auto complete it
801:47 - and uh it we just imported header up
801:51 - there and uh let's also import
801:55 - home
801:57 - okay so I'm gonna do home
801:59 - like that
802:01 - and so I imported header from components
802:03 - header I imported home from components
802:06 - home we got header and home under the
802:09 - route call Path slash home so that means
802:13 - now I should be able to go slash home
802:15 - and it should take me to it so both of
802:18 - those components are showing and that's
802:21 - exactly what we wanted perfect so now
802:23 - you should be able to go to slash home
802:26 - see all of this stuff and let's keep
802:28 - rocking and rolling here okay so
802:32 - next up let's add in our containers you
802:35 - know how I like to do these things guys
802:37 - so let's go to our header file
802:41 - okay and inside of our header we're
802:44 - going to do a couple of things so you
802:46 - guys are going to need to keep up with
802:47 - me okay so let's go ahead and um
802:51 - add a container inside of the container
802:55 - let's add our content okay it's out of
802:58 - there let's add just text that says
803:00 - header for now okay so this is what it
803:03 - should look like for now and now we're
803:06 - going to add these style components
803:08 - right underneath here okay so I'm going
803:09 - to do container style div and let's
803:13 - leave it empty for now
803:15 - and let's do the same thing for content
803:17 - and we're going to style div and we're
803:18 - going to leave it empty for now okay
803:20 - let's hit refresh boom so so far this is
803:24 - what you should be seeing okay if I
803:26 - change this with boogie boogie hit save
803:29 - you should now see boogie boogie here
803:32 - okay
803:33 - cool
803:35 - now we're gonna start styling this stuff
803:38 - in here so let's add a background color
803:40 - and let's go White
803:43 - dope so it looks a little funny right
803:46 - now because it's just just bright white
803:48 - and it's almost like somebody was
803:49 - cleaning a really dusty board right
803:53 - that's what it looks like
803:56 - now let's add a border
803:59 - bottom one pixel let's make it solid and
804:03 - okay
804:06 - uh weird did not need that many
804:08 - parentheses so
804:11 - bugger off mite
804:14 - cool
804:15 - okay
804:16 - and uh now let's go ahead and add left
804:21 - zero
804:23 - okay and underneath this let's add some
804:26 - padding so we'll go uh Zero by 24 pixels
804:30 - just like that position I'm gonna go
804:33 - ahead and go fixed top give it zero
804:37 - and I'm just going to give it a crazy Z
804:39 - index because I want to make sure that
804:41 - that always stays on top
804:43 - okay and that's like never going away
804:46 - anywhere again a lot of this stuff is
804:48 - going to be invisible until you click
804:50 - into it like this and now you'll see
804:52 - this header okay I'm in inspect mode so
804:56 - just bear with me
804:58 - promise is going to get better
805:00 - let's give it a background color or
805:02 - actually no I'm sorry
805:04 - let's not do that let's give it let's do
805:07 - display Flex so now we have the flex
805:09 - mode enabled
805:11 - now let's go align items Center on this
805:15 - thing
805:16 - okay it'll Center align items let's go
805:18 - margin zero Auto
805:21 - and let's go Min height 100 percent
805:26 - okay hit save and let's go Max width of
805:30 - 128 pixels
805:32 - okay awesome now with this guys you're
805:34 - not gonna see much again this is to set
805:37 - us up for our next step where we're
805:39 - gonna now start adding the logo and the
805:41 - header okay and then you can actually
805:44 - start to see what this code was doing so
805:47 - let's go ahead and now add the logo so
805:50 - I'm going to grab the home logo and I'm
805:54 - going to add it in our images okay boom
805:58 - right there now let's go back to our
806:01 - header file and in our header file I'm
806:05 - going to now start by adding this image
806:08 - so let's go to the top and inside of
806:11 - content let's remove the word header we
806:14 - don't need that anymore let's add a
806:18 - component called logo inside of that
806:20 - let's add a link tag
806:23 - okay and um we're gonna say that this
806:26 - image should take us to the home page
806:28 - meaning that if I'm logged in if I hit
806:31 - that image right there you know it
806:34 - should take me essentially
806:37 - to the home page
806:39 - okay which is this page right here
806:41 - okay so now we're just gonna add the
806:44 - actual logo and the image
806:47 - so inside of this link tag let's add an
806:50 - image tag like so
806:52 - and this image tag is going to be slash
806:55 - Images slash home Dash logo dot SVG okay
807:00 - that's what we just added right here
807:03 - homelogo.svg now style components is
807:06 - going to complain it's going to say hey
807:08 - I don't see this component or The
807:09 - Styling for it no worries let's go ahead
807:12 - and add it my friend so I'm going to add
807:15 - a logo like this styled and I'm going to
807:18 - make it a span tag let's make it empty
807:20 - for now
807:21 - and let's do margin
807:23 - write eight pixels
807:26 - and then let's go ahead and do font size
807:29 - about zero pixels just like so let's hit
807:32 - refresh and ta-da all of that work that
807:36 - we had done earlier
807:38 - is now showing us what's going on okay
807:42 - so let's try removing these things and
807:45 - let's see if it makes a difference right
807:46 - so I removed container and look you
807:50 - cannot see anything right but now let me
807:52 - bring everything inside of container and
807:54 - now you can see it and now you can see
807:56 - why we gave it a color of white because
807:59 - now it's visually there okay
808:03 - so great work
808:05 - all right so now let's go ahead and add
808:09 - search and input and search icon so for
808:12 - example this search bar right here let's
808:15 - go ahead and add it and let's go ahead
808:18 - and uh get started on it right now boom
808:21 - so first things first we're gonna go
808:23 - ahead into our header file okay and uh
808:27 - in our header file we're gonna do a
808:29 - bunch of stuff okay along with like
808:31 - some stuff with SVG okay so what I'll
808:34 - try to do is I'll try to kind of um give
808:39 - you this SVG so you can have access to
808:41 - it as well okay so let's keep going I'm
808:44 - going to give you access to the SVG file
808:46 - too in a second but let's go ahead under
808:48 - our logo and under our logo what I'm
808:52 - going to do is I'm going to create a
808:54 - search component okay and let's hit
808:58 - search and I'm going to hit tab all
809:00 - right inside of my search component I'm
809:03 - going to create a new div inside of that
809:06 - div I'm going to create an input okay
809:09 - and I'm going to add a placeholder all
809:13 - right just like so now I'm going to go
809:16 - and create a new component called search
809:18 - icon let me actually go ahead and do
809:20 - that like this okay search icon will be
809:23 - inside of my search component so that
809:25 - makes sense
809:27 - all right now inside of my search icon
809:30 - I'm going to add my SVG uh logo slash
809:35 - path okay so I'm going to give you
809:37 - access to this as well but here it is
809:41 - all right if you guys need it again all
809:44 - of this is going to be Link in the
809:45 - description below so that way you guys
809:48 - have access to it okay so it's an SVG
809:51 - and then all we gotta do is uh we just
809:54 - have to close out of this SVG
809:59 - okay just like so
810:01 - so boom now again search is not defined
810:05 - search icon is not defined so we're just
810:06 - going to go ahead and create those okay
810:08 - so let's go ahead and let's do search
810:10 - first and then we're gonna do search
810:13 - icon so let's go search
810:15 - and um you guys know the drill I'm gonna
810:18 - go ahead and make it empty for now and
810:20 - let's go ahead and create styling for
810:22 - our search icon as well I'll go and uh
810:26 - do this okay so empty empty cool so we
810:30 - got our search icon right here we got
810:32 - our search bar right there
810:36 - um it is looking beautiful magnificent
810:40 - and we like it all right now all we have
810:44 - to do is start styling our search
810:46 - component all right so let's go ahead
810:48 - and style this thing okay so inside of
810:51 - our search I'm going to give it a
810:53 - opacity of one let's give it a flex grow
810:57 - of one as well okay and
811:02 - um I think I'm going to give it a
811:04 - position relative okay
811:07 - and then let's do the following for this
811:12 - div
811:13 - all right
811:15 - let's go Max with we'll go 280 pixels
811:19 - okay
811:21 - input I'm gonna go
811:24 - border
811:25 - none for the input so now notice that
811:29 - there's no border anymore so it already
811:32 - looks much cleaner
811:34 - uh box Shadow will go none
811:38 - and then background color
811:41 - eef3f8
811:44 - okay that gives it a little light gray
811:49 - I'm gonna go border radius of two pixels
811:52 - cool
811:57 - okay
811:59 - that's gonna be the font color and width
812:02 - will go 218
812:05 - pixels so now it's a little bit wider
812:09 - padding
812:13 - okay
812:14 - so
812:16 - great I'm gonna give it a line height of
812:21 - 1.75 okay so it became a little uh
812:25 - you know wider from the top got a little
812:28 - bit more height
812:28 - [Music]
812:30 - a hence height font weight
812:35 - let's give it 400.
812:37 - great
812:39 - font size we'll give it 14 pixels
812:43 - make sure every full screen it nice
812:46 - looks good
812:48 - looks really good
812:50 - height let's give it 34 pixels
812:54 - border color I'm going to give it a
812:59 - this color right here
813:01 - cool and then vertical align
813:05 - text top
813:08 - okay great so this thing is looking good
813:11 - now the search bar okay now let's work
813:15 - on the search icon
813:18 - so we have the style div that we started
813:21 - then let's go ahead and style that
813:23 - search icon component as well
813:26 - so we're gonna make the width 40 pixels
813:28 - for it
813:30 - position absolute
813:32 - Z index let's give it a one
813:36 - top 10 pixels
813:39 - so now it's getting inside of that
813:42 - search bar which is exactly what we want
813:46 - so that's good
813:47 - and we're doing that by using of course
813:50 - position absolute making sure that the Z
813:53 - index is making sure that it's not like
813:55 - hiding behind other things you know I
813:57 - don't know if I give it a z index of
813:59 - negative 200 it might hide behind other
814:02 - things right so Z index one just make
814:04 - sure hey don't hide don't be shy okay
814:07 - and then the position absolute just
814:10 - allows us to like position it okay
814:13 - now let's go border radius of
814:18 - that
814:19 - cool and then margin of zero
814:23 - great
814:24 - I don't want any box Shadow I mean I
814:26 - don't think I'm gonna even add that line
814:29 - okay
814:31 - I mean I could have pointer events none
814:34 - for this
814:35 - let's go and see
814:38 - yeah that's kind of cool
814:40 - okay so there's no um that's a nice
814:43 - little touch right because if I save now
814:45 - if I hover over it my mouse still looks
814:48 - like a pointer right but watch what
814:51 - happens when I go pointer events none
814:53 - when I hover over it the whole thing is
814:56 - a text box it's a nice little finesse
815:00 - that we decide to put in here for you
815:02 - and of course let's go display Flex so
815:06 - we have flex functionalities and flex
815:08 - superpowers and let's
815:11 - uh horizontally align that great now
815:14 - it's a little bit closer to the search
815:17 - bar
815:18 - okay
815:20 - look at it oh man that search bar is
815:22 - looking nice
815:24 - all right and then align items we're
815:26 - gonna align it to be Center and then of
815:29 - course let's add a transition
815:32 - background color and then have that
815:36 - transition be
815:38 - 0.15 seconds
815:40 - cool
815:42 - okay
815:44 - okay dokie okay I I mean I don't even
815:48 - think honestly we need that line you can
815:50 - kind of take that out and it still looks
815:52 - fine to me okay I like to just simplify
815:54 - it if we don't need something just take
815:56 - it out okay
815:58 - cool so search icon is looking good
816:02 - search is looking good
816:05 - yeah to me this is looking great okay
816:08 - you're making great progress so far I'm
816:11 - really proud of you now what we're going
816:12 - to do is we're going to actually turn
816:13 - that search icon into a file okay so I
816:18 - think that's going to be a lot better uh
816:20 - for you so let's go ahead and do that so
816:22 - I'll show you how to actually turn this
816:24 - into a file
816:26 - so inside of search icon what I'm going
816:30 - to do is I'm going to take this SVG
816:33 - right I'm going to cut it
816:35 - you need to cut it
816:38 - okay and um inside of my public images
816:42 - I'll create a new file
816:45 - and we're going to call it search Dash
816:48 - icon dot SVG just like so
816:51 - now inside of here I'm going to paste
816:54 - that SVG code okay so now notice that my
816:58 - search icon is not there anymore
817:01 - makes sense
817:03 - now what I'm going to do instead in my
817:06 - header I'm just going to replace all
817:08 - that SVG garbage code that I had
817:11 - I'm just going to replace that with this
817:13 - image
817:14 - and I'm just gonna go search
817:18 - icon.svg like so and ta-da
817:22 - we got that icon right there okay this
817:24 - is also highlights to you
817:27 - how you can actually turn that into a
817:30 - file all right has a nice little touch
817:33 - right there
817:34 - great
817:35 - now let's start adding things to our nav
817:39 - bar okay and we're going to start making
817:41 - progress on that
817:43 - all right so now let's style our nav bar
817:47 - okay and let's make it look pretty
817:50 - Pretty Ricky Ricky all right here we go
817:53 - so I'm gonna jump inside of my headers
817:57 - and uh we're gonna add nav okay and
818:00 - we're gonna add nav right underneath
818:02 - this search so give me a nav component
818:05 - just like this please and let's just go
818:07 - ahead and say nav menus now we're going
818:10 - to go ahead in our
818:12 - styling and we're just going to say
818:14 - const nav styled nav like this okay and
818:19 - we're going to go inside of here get a
818:21 - little margin left get a little bit of
818:24 - ah
818:25 - okay that's looking good display block
818:27 - beautiful got nav menus showing up on
818:31 - the top right hand side that looks good
818:33 - uh of course let's add in a media query
818:36 - for phones 768 pixels mobile devices in
818:41 - general and let's say hey if you're on
818:43 - mobile give me a fixed position on this
818:45 - nav and give me a left of zero bottom of
818:49 - zero
818:51 - background white
818:53 - and of course give me a width of a
818:57 - hundred percent okay so there we go
819:00 - beautiful that's what it looks like on a
819:02 - mobile device now okay
819:04 - Pretty Ricky Ricky
819:06 - okay cool full screen this thing
819:10 - so some of the nav menu items seems like
819:13 - they're now coming to the bottom which
819:15 - is fine
819:16 - okay we ain't got a problem with that
819:18 - right do you got a problem with that
819:21 - because I don't have a problem with that
819:23 - okay so you should neither all right
819:26 - let's keep rocking and rolling all right
819:29 - so we got the nav done now let's go
819:31 - ahead and add home to the nav menu so
819:33 - first things first let's grab our image
819:37 - okay let's take that image and I'm going
819:40 - to add the nav home image right there
819:42 - all right so this is our image now let's
819:46 - go inside of our header JS file and
819:49 - inside of our header JS we're going to
819:51 - do a couple of things so first things
819:53 - first let's actually wrap the nav
819:56 - actually not wrap the nav bar but inside
819:58 - of the nav bar I'm gonna what I'm gonna
820:00 - do is I'm going to delete where it says
820:02 - nav menus so delete that and instead I'm
820:05 - going to make a new component that says
820:07 - nav list wrap just like this I'm going
820:10 - to tab that and I'm going to hit enter
820:12 - and then I'm going to make another
820:13 - component inside it that's called NAB
820:15 - list hit tab then hit enter and inside
820:18 - of that let's make an a tag
820:21 - um and inside of that a tag actually
820:24 - here's what we'll do okay we don't need
820:26 - an ah ref for this okay we don't need
820:29 - that but we do need this thing tag
820:32 - wrapped up in an a tag so let's go here
820:35 - and inside of here let's add an image
820:37 - and for that image we're gonna go images
820:40 - with the nav home.svg like that okay
820:43 - that's the one that we put in our SVG
820:45 - file so what it should look like is you
820:48 - got your nav bar
820:50 - you got your nav list inside of that and
820:53 - you got your NAB uh I'm sorry not NAB
820:55 - list
820:56 - excuse me nav you have your nav list
821:00 - inside of there okay
821:02 - so that's looking good now it's
821:04 - complaining hey it's not defined okay no
821:08 - worries let's go ahead and Define this
821:10 - so let's go ahead and do first of all
821:14 - const nav list wrap
821:17 - okay and equal styled
821:20 - UL it's going to be an unordered list
821:23 - and let's leave it like this then let's
821:25 - go here and we're going to have our nav
821:27 - list and this is going to be a style
821:29 - bullet points uh
821:32 - okay
821:34 - here we go oh my bad let's put the tilde
821:38 - tilde at the end of it good good good
821:40 - good good good good so now all we see is
821:42 - this bullet point right here that's okay
821:45 - because that's what we expected okay
821:48 - um now we're gonna make it mean
821:50 - something in a second by doing our
821:52 - styling so inside of our nav list wrap
821:55 - let's go ahead and do this so display
821:57 - Flex
821:58 - inside of here we're going to flex wrap
822:01 - do normal wrap and then let's do list
822:04 - style type
822:07 - none okay let's open this up and now
822:10 - because we did list style none we don't
822:13 - have that little dot there
822:14 - [Music]
822:16 - um that we were getting so that's fine
822:18 - now inside of nav list
822:20 - let's start doing let's enable display
822:23 - Flex
822:24 - and align items let's make them centered
822:28 - okay and now let's make a a style our
822:33 - link tags and let's give it a little bit
822:37 - of a styling okay so first of all we're
822:38 - going to sell line items in the center
822:40 - background let's make it transparent I'm
822:44 - using Vim so you'll see a lot of jks
822:46 - happening there that's my shortcut for
822:48 - getting out of the mode and let's go
822:50 - Direction column and I'll show you why
822:53 - that's important uh later okay so column
822:56 - cool
822:57 - let's go font size 12 pixels
823:03 - font
823:04 - weight 400 okay
823:08 - just hang in with me there it's gonna
823:10 - make sense I promised my child I promise
823:14 - my child this is gonna make sense all
823:17 - right just hang in there for me pal
823:20 - Justified accountant it's going to be
823:23 - Center and long hot we're going to give
823:26 - it a 1.5 because why not okay
823:30 - and uh let's give it a Min height
823:34 - of 52 pixel enemy with
823:38 - of 80 pixels like so
823:42 - and uh position of relative okay and of
823:48 - course you know my style I do not like
823:52 - text decorations and the underlines that
823:55 - I sometimes normally get
823:56 - okay
823:58 - so none is gonna be far about me put
824:02 - that there
824:03 - okay and now just a couple of last
824:06 - things we're going to do let me just
824:07 - make sure that our nav list is right so
824:09 - we've got our nav list
824:11 - nav home dot SVG
824:15 - a
824:17 - nav list wrap we got our nav list inside
824:20 - of that we got our a tags great
824:24 - okay let's keep on rocking and rolling
824:26 - whoops okay
824:28 - okay my bad so this nav home is gonna be
824:32 - inside of images okay unlike me being an
824:35 - idiot that I am I put it not inside of
824:38 - images so of course I didn't have access
824:40 - to this okay here we go it's right there
824:43 - okay
824:45 - cool
824:46 - um so sorry there's tons of mysterious
824:49 - code and you're probably like what the
824:50 - hell's going on we don't need the cursor
824:52 - pointer we can get rid of that okay cool
824:54 - okay so now
824:57 - a lot of this is gonna make sense all
825:00 - right so you solve it and I took away a
825:01 - line item Center watch it became so huge
825:04 - and massive right that's what she said
825:06 - but when I take it away and I hit save
825:10 - it's gone all right also this is what
825:13 - the media query part is doing all right
825:15 - let me remove all these lines of code so
825:17 - you and I can be on the same page
825:19 - because I coded just a little bit ahead
825:21 - of you but now we're back so no worries
825:24 - um
825:25 - let me just close this paren here okay
825:27 - and we're just going to code this thing
825:29 - up together okay so hit save
825:33 - um and if I hit this now we can see this
825:36 - icon right there
825:37 - okay beautiful mystery solved now inside
825:42 - of this a tag let's go span and let's
825:46 - give it a little color all right and uh
825:49 - we're gonna give it this color okay so
825:52 - boom there we go that's good and where
825:56 - is this going to show up you might be
825:57 - asking here's where that's going to show
825:59 - up okay so inside of our let's go to our
826:01 - navless component now inside of our
826:03 - navless component you see that we have
826:05 - added this a tag well what we want to
826:08 - add inside of that a tank is not just an
826:12 - image but actually a span tag as well
826:15 - that says home okay so like that the a
826:19 - link contains an image and a span tag
826:22 - called home so now this is what it
826:25 - should be looking like we got home right
826:26 - there okay and when we go to
826:30 - phone screen right we got home at the
826:33 - bottom which is pretty freaking cool how
826:35 - the media query Works magically and
826:39 - makes that happen Okay uh media query
826:42 - makes that happen at the bottom right
826:45 - like for example if I change that to top
826:47 - it's gonna make that happen at the top
826:49 - but we don't want that at the top we
826:51 - want it at the bottom okay there we go
826:55 - cool so now let's style that span tag
826:58 - right but the color home now has that
827:01 - little like grayish color that you can
827:03 - see let's go display flex and uh let's
827:06 - align items of course Center
827:10 - okay
827:12 - so that's just going to make sure that
827:14 - the text is vertically aligned how we
827:18 - want it now let's get out of this span
827:20 - tag and we're going to add in a media
827:22 - query and I'm just going to say hey my
827:25 - Max
827:26 - width should be that which is meaning a
827:30 - mobile device or a tablet or something
827:32 - of that nature and let's give it a Min
827:35 - width of 70 pixels okay and then let's
827:39 - get out of let's get out of all of that
827:43 - and on Hover
827:45 - what I wanted to do is the following and
827:48 - on active here's also what I wanted to
827:50 - do
827:51 - okay the attack specifically to the a
827:55 - tag on Hover here's what I want to
827:57 - happen and specifically it is a span tag
827:59 - on hover or active inside of the a tag I
828:04 - wanted to get just a slight color change
828:09 - k all right now you can get lost in how
828:12 - it's nested it can get kind of weird but
828:16 - um it's a nice little touch okay watch
828:18 - this when I hover over this home Watch
828:20 - What Happens boom it's very very subtle
828:25 - it's a very subtle shift okay that's all
828:28 - that's happening there so just a side
828:30 - note if you're watching this video right
828:32 - now there's a lot of weird things that
828:34 - you can kind of get tripped up on
828:36 - especially how things are nested inside
828:38 - of one another so like be on the lookout
828:41 - for that and just be careful when you're
828:43 - going through this right because for
828:45 - example here right it's the on Hover and
828:48 - on it being active inside of the a tag
828:52 - and inside of the span tag that's inside
828:55 - of the a tag have this color happen Okay
828:58 - so sometimes you can get lost very
828:59 - quickly and easily so just be on the
829:01 - lookout for that alright so now let's
829:03 - add
829:04 - um nav menus like uh like the home menu
829:07 - that we added but we're gonna add all of
829:10 - the rest of them meaning I want to now
829:13 - add uh all of these ones here my network
829:16 - jobs messaging yada yada yada okay and
829:20 - so let's start working on that well for
829:22 - a couple of things we're gonna need need
829:24 - all these have items so we already did
829:26 - nav home so we don't need that anymore
829:28 - but we're gonna need nav jobs messaging
829:32 - Network notifications and work so I'm
829:35 - going to hold shift click here select
829:38 - all of these and drop them inside of my
829:42 - images all right now that it's inside of
829:45 - my images I'm simply going to go to the
829:49 - top of my file header JS file let's go
829:52 - to our nav list and all I'm going to do
829:57 - is I'm just going to keep on adding more
829:59 - nav list so for example here I'm going
830:02 - to select this nav list component and
830:05 - I'm going to do the following okay so
830:07 - this is just be careful on this as
830:09 - you're following me I'm going to hit
830:11 - like I'm going to copy this entire
830:13 - component okay copy the entire component
830:17 - and then all I'm going to do is just
830:18 - replicate it a couple of more times
830:21 - paste paste
830:24 - paste paste okay and how many icons are
830:28 - there let's go check one two three four
830:31 - five okay
830:33 - maybe six but I think it's five if I'm
830:37 - not mistaken okay it worked under your
830:39 - messenger jobs yeah so I think I'm fine
830:42 - pasting it five times
830:44 - um now let's go and start giving them
830:46 - those names so we have nav Dash home
830:49 - now this one is going to be nav Dash uh
830:52 - jobs I imagine actually nav Dash Network
830:55 - okay let's see what the first one is
830:59 - um in the completed version we have
831:00 - Network jobs okay so the next one is
831:05 - going to be jobs and then after jobs
831:08 - it's going to be nav Dash messaging and
831:11 - after nav Dash messaging is going to be
831:14 - nav Dash notifications like so
831:18 - now you can see on the mobile version so
831:22 - nice looks so good on a mobile device
831:24 - let me actually move my face a little
831:27 - bit out of here so you can see that like
831:29 - wow am I pretending to look down right
831:32 - wow that looks amazing
831:37 - okay so there you go that is beautiful
831:40 - and when I go full screen I see them all
831:43 - up there okay and now I want to change
831:46 - what it says so for example where it
831:49 - says um home leave that as is but the
831:53 - span tag inside of the nav Network well
831:56 - we're gonna go ahead and change that and
831:58 - we're gonna say my network okay
832:01 - we're gonna go to the jobs one and we're
832:03 - going to change that and we're going to
832:06 - change that to just jobs
832:08 - okay the one
832:10 - below that we're just going to change
832:12 - that to messaging and the one below that
832:14 - uh we're going to change that to
832:16 - Notifications okay so now on mobile
832:18 - device it is looking great and uh let's
832:22 - go full screen it's looking pretty
832:24 - freaking great
832:25 - that's exactly what we're looking for so
832:28 - our nav bar is now starting to look
832:31 - really really good that makes me really
832:33 - happy so let's continue going forward
832:35 - and now add the activation functionality
832:39 - to this entire thing okay so how I'm
832:42 - gonna do that is instead of nav list
832:45 - let's go where we have nav list and what
832:49 - I'm going to do is I'm gonna do
832:51 - something special okay and I'm just
832:54 - gonna do this to the home one none of
832:56 - the other ones for now okay I'm just
832:58 - gonna kind of hard coded inside of the
833:00 - home one and the functionality we're now
833:02 - adding is you see how this home one here
833:05 - is active right but these ones look like
833:07 - they're not active let's so we're going
833:10 - to add that styling to our app
833:13 - so let's go ahead and do that okay so
833:15 - nav flash uh nav list and to this nav
833:19 - list I'm going to add class name
833:22 - and I'm just going to call it active
833:25 - okay and simply all we're gonna do now
833:28 - is we're gonna go inside our nav list
833:32 - wrap
833:34 - okay so let's go inside to our nav list
833:36 - wrap
833:38 - right here okay and uh under our nav
833:42 - list wrap we're just going to add the
833:44 - stylings we're going to do DOT active so
833:46 - for active class do the following for
833:49 - the span tag and right after that we're
833:51 - gonna just do content blank whoops
833:56 - that's fun cool transform scale of X I
834:02 - don't know why it does that one oh key
834:04 - dokie and uh simply then border we're
834:08 - gonna give it a border bottom
834:10 - of two pixels solid and let's go white
834:14 - Dash FFF
834:16 - cool okay
834:19 - so we're working on this functionality
834:22 - [Music]
834:24 - uh bottom I'm gonna give it a zero ta uh
834:28 - left zero position absolute
834:32 - position a spell position
834:36 - okay
834:39 - give it a 200 millisecond ease in and
834:42 - out
834:44 - and I'll give it a border color of
834:48 - like this
834:50 - okay
834:52 - so now we have this going on here
834:55 - so now boom there we go I just had to
834:58 - hit refresh okay and there we go we got
835:01 - home it's going active when I hover over
835:04 - it that's exactly what we want and even
835:06 - on Mobile screen I can see home has that
835:09 - like nice little underline and um you
835:12 - know that's kind of what I expect to see
835:14 - on the on the home
835:17 - um you know the mobile app the mobile
835:20 - version of all of this all right so
835:23 - let's keep on going all right so now
835:25 - let's go ahead and add
835:28 - um add user nav menu and add work nav
835:31 - menu okay so we're gonna add a couple of
835:35 - more things so for example here we have
835:37 - a user menu and then here we have a work
835:40 - menu okay looking thing so let's go
835:43 - ahead and add those two as well so first
835:45 - things first we're gonna need the down
835:48 - icon that little tiny icon right there
835:51 - it's a little bit hard to see but it's
835:53 - that icon right there okay so we're
835:56 - gonna need that
835:57 - um the other thing actually you know
835:59 - what let's just throw that into the
836:00 - images first I'm gonna need that the
836:03 - other thing we're gonna need is the nav
836:05 - work menu so let's go nav Dash work boom
836:08 - I'm gonna need that
836:11 - um
836:11 - oh we already have that that's fine and
836:14 - then the other thing we're gonna need is
836:15 - a user SVG
836:18 - okay
836:19 - there we go there it is
836:22 - okay okay so now that you have all the
836:25 - images let's go inside of our header and
836:28 - start adding them okay so let's go ahead
836:30 - and create these components as well by
836:32 - the way so I'm gonna go all the way
836:35 - under nav list but if within navless rap
836:39 - so right under the nav list ending let's
836:43 - go ahead and add user component
836:47 - okay and then right underneath that
836:50 - we're going to add our work component
836:52 - okay so these are the two components
836:54 - we're going to have now within our user
836:56 - component let's go ahead and add a
836:58 - couple of things so I'm going to add a a
837:00 - tag but I don't need an ah ref for this
837:03 - either I just need to borrow the link
837:05 - tag style link and inside of this a tag
837:08 - I'm going to need an image and I'm going
837:11 - to use the user.svg
837:14 - okay like so
837:16 - um
837:17 - right underneath this a tag right
837:21 - underneath this image what I'm going to
837:23 - need is a span
837:26 - that's gonna just say me
837:29 - okay and right underneath that me I'm
837:32 - going to need another image
837:34 - and I'm gonna give it the drop down menu
837:38 - okay so far makes complete sense because
837:41 - you got the user image right underneath
837:43 - that you got the drop down image okay so
837:45 - that's looking good now we're good with
837:48 - this part let's go inside of the work
837:50 - part work work work work work work
837:54 - so now let's go and add a couple of
837:57 - things so let's go to a tag again we're
837:59 - probably not going to need any of the
838:01 - other things let's add an image inside
838:03 - of the work tag and we're gonna add in
838:05 - the work image okay nav dashwork.svg
838:08 - cool and also we want to add um
838:12 - a span tag inside of here
838:14 - and we'll give it we'll say work and
838:17 - within NetSpend tag
838:20 - okay we didn't NetSpend tag I'm going to
838:22 - add another image
838:23 - and uh we're gonna give it images down
838:27 - icon dot SVG like so okay
838:30 - cool now it's complaining hey user is
838:33 - not defined work is not defined hey no
838:35 - problem I like when work is not defined
838:37 - because that's how I live my life as a
838:39 - CEO let's go all right so we're gonna do
838:43 - create new styling for the component up
838:47 - and got my thoughts all right so there
838:50 - we go and now I'm basically going to add
838:52 - my style components okay that's all I'm
838:54 - going to do so I'm going to borrow my
838:57 - styling from our nav list okay that's
839:00 - how you can borrow styling from
839:02 - something else and uh for my work I'm
839:05 - going to borrow my styling from the user
839:07 - okay that's kind of nice let's just hit
839:10 - save for now
839:12 - um oh let's do Style with a small S I
839:16 - believe
839:17 - okay
839:18 - user is not defined
839:21 - okay fair enough fair enough we'll
839:23 - Define it there we go okay so on the
839:26 - mobile screen now you get this funny
839:27 - looking thing at the bottom right okay
839:29 - if you're not seeing it I'm just gonna
839:31 - move this here
839:32 - I'm gonna get this funny looking image
839:34 - the bottom right
839:36 - and if I go full screen you'll see me
839:39 - and you'll see work
839:41 - so that's cool but that looks ugly so
839:44 - we're gonna fix that
839:46 - okay so let's go here to user and do a
839:50 - couple of things and basically we're
839:51 - gonna say hey
839:52 - the SVG inside of this a tag look we got
839:56 - to do something with this thing all
839:57 - right it's it's uh just unacceptable so
840:01 - let's start off with width okay let's
840:03 - try to control the width of this link
840:05 - tag
840:07 - okay and then uh let's also try to
840:10 - control the Border uh radius
840:15 - okay fifty
840:17 - 50 50 can go 50 50 with
840:21 - okay let's see hopefully that does
840:24 - something if it doesn't do something
840:26 - um I got another idea in mind okay so
840:28 - another thing what we can do is uh let's
840:31 - go let's grab the image tag inside of
840:34 - here and give that a width of 50 24
840:37 - pixels beautiful so now you see the
840:40 - image is actually quiet
840:42 - small
840:44 - all right so that's controlling the
840:46 - image that's good let's give it a height
840:48 - of 24 pixels
840:51 - all right cool cool cool
840:54 - and now let's give it a border radius of
840:58 - 50 that's going to add that nice little
841:00 - circular effect to it so you can already
841:03 - see it's starting to have the nice
841:05 - little circular effect that's great
841:08 - and let's go span tag
841:12 - and uh we're just going to align items
841:15 - in the center
841:17 - all right because that's just how we
841:21 - like to do things around here all right
841:23 - and now inside of my work
841:26 - All I'm gonna do because it's already
841:28 - borrowing tons of styling we're just
841:30 - going to
841:31 - give it a certain border
841:35 - okay
841:36 - give it a nice little nice little color
841:39 - so there it is and when I highlight it
841:42 - looks a certain way we got the drop down
841:43 - we got the me with the big fat Arrow
841:46 - this is pretty freaking cool
841:48 - looking great okay
841:51 - okay great work young Padawan so far
841:54 - we're looking good we're looking smooth
841:57 - we're looking clean so let's just keep
842:00 - on rocking and rolling through this
842:01 - thing okay now we're gonna add sign out
842:03 - functionality okay
842:06 - so let's go into
842:09 - um let's go inside of our user because
842:12 - that's where
842:13 - sign in functionality is going to be
842:15 - added so my user is right here
842:19 - okay let's go right down there right
842:21 - underneath the a tag ending and I'll add
842:23 - the sign out component
842:26 - okay now this component before we build
842:29 - it this is going to be this component
842:31 - right here when I hover over
842:34 - all right it gives me that sign out
842:36 - option that's what this component is
842:38 - going to be
842:40 - all right so that's what that component
842:42 - is going to look like okay so now let's
842:43 - go ahead and just build it out now
842:45 - inside of my sign out
842:47 - I want to add an a tag again I don't
842:51 - need the ah ref
842:53 - and um all I'm gonna have it do is say
842:56 - sign out and again I'm just adding the
842:58 - attack to borrow the styling that I have
843:01 - added to it okay so hit save let's go
843:04 - down and let's create our styled
843:07 - component for sign out const sign out
843:10 - okay and we're just gonna do styled div
843:13 - let's leave it empty for now
843:16 - and let's go inside of here let's uh
843:21 - let's go back let's hit refresh
843:23 - cool
843:25 - okay
843:26 - so we have something showing up that's a
843:29 - good sign now instead of inside of our
843:32 - sign out we're gonna
843:34 - let's
843:36 - uh go ahead and do position absolute
843:40 - let's go top by 45 pixels
843:45 - okay
843:46 - and I'm going to pass on the drop shadow
843:50 - because again it's one of those like
843:52 - weird looking ones so I'm just gonna
843:53 - keep it simple here
843:56 - so sign out
843:58 - creates a little box around so give it a
844:01 - white background
844:02 - and now let's give it a border
844:05 - radius of
844:09 - this okay
844:11 - so now outside now it has a little
844:13 - border radius around it right there that
844:15 - you can see that looks cool
844:19 - and under here I'll give it a width of
844:22 - 100 pixels
844:23 - okay and a height of 40 pixels
844:28 - okay so now the sign out is starting to
844:31 - get under control and not looking as
844:33 - crazy
844:35 - give it a font size of 16 pixels and
844:39 - transition duration
844:42 - this is going to give it that little
844:44 - effect when it comes up which it's not
844:47 - going to do right now but in a second we
844:48 - will add that so then it'll look much
844:50 - nicer text align and let's align it in
844:54 - the center
844:56 - display none
844:58 - that looks good
845:01 - okay so it won't display anything and
845:04 - then it'll come up on Hover
845:07 - okay so now let's go inside of our user
845:11 - which borrows from our style component
845:14 - uh navless component so inside of user
845:17 - we're going to create a new thing and
845:20 - we're basically going to say on Hover do
845:23 - the following for the user
845:26 - all right now we're going to select use
845:29 - this fancy selector
845:32 - to select our sign out component
845:35 - okay and style it
845:38 - align item Center
845:42 - okay and I'm going to justify content
845:44 - inside of the center
845:46 - all right now we're having reference
845:48 - error so what's going on here cannot
845:50 - access sign out before initialization
845:52 - interesting
845:54 - so what we need to do is um we need to
845:57 - move this code up I believe let's take
845:59 - the sign out code and
846:03 - um move it up
846:06 - up above user
846:09 - okay let's move it right there
846:12 - and uh we should be good
846:14 - nice we are good
846:18 - okay because yeah I couldn't reference
846:20 - sign out because it wasn't defined yet
846:21 - defined yet so we just make sure we
846:23 - defined it right before
846:26 - okay
846:28 - so let's go back
846:30 - now when I hover over me you can
846:33 - actually see this drop down of sign out
846:35 - showing up that's a really good sign
846:37 - that's what you should be seeing right
846:39 - now okay dope so looking good so far now
846:42 - let's keep on going with this thing okay
846:44 - so we're now going to add a container
846:47 - and I'm gonna basically add another
846:50 - component using style components okay
846:53 - so let's go with that and we're gonna
846:55 - add the hiring in a hurry part which
846:58 - looks like this ad right here right
847:00 - there
847:01 - all right that gives it also a
847:03 - linkedin-esque feeling we're gonna go
847:05 - ahead and add that now
847:07 - cool so let's go inside of Home JS all
847:11 - right and we're gonna add that here so
847:14 - um we're gonna be doing a lot of stuff
847:15 - so inside of this return okay let's just
847:18 - open this return uh create a container
847:21 - component inside its container component
847:23 - create a section component
847:25 - and then let's create an H5 and again
847:29 - let's create an a tag
847:31 - but uh
847:34 - um without the ahrefs okay
847:41 - like so just to borrow the styling and
847:44 - then basically what I'm gonna do is um
847:47 - just type in hiring in a hurry question
847:50 - mark
847:54 - all right and uh just like that okay
847:58 - and then underneath this H5 I'm going to
848:01 - make a P tag
848:03 - and um
848:05 - basically I'm just gonna say find
848:08 - talented Pros in record time with upwork
848:13 - and keep
848:15 - business moving and put a period there
848:19 - save
848:20 - okay so I have a section inside of which
848:23 - I have an H5 and a paragraph tag
848:26 - cool
848:27 - now let's go ahead and just style this
848:29 - and a lot of these are very common
848:32 - stylings that we have already kind of
848:34 - done so I'm gonna like go through this
848:36 - much faster
848:38 - so our container is going to be I'm
848:41 - going to just keep it empty for now and
848:44 - start off with that I'll have my content
848:46 - is going to be styled div we'll keep it
848:48 - empty for now we'll have section and um
848:52 - I think I'm going to make that section
848:55 - okay style section and again we'll keep
848:58 - it empty for now so it doesn't complain
849:00 - and uh there you go okay so now we have
849:04 - that text but you saw it was a little
849:05 - hard to see right it's kind of up here
849:08 - hiding okay and we basically need to
849:11 - push it down that's what we're gonna do
849:14 - right now we're gonna push it down
849:17 - so inside of my container I will go
849:20 - ahead and do give some padding to the
849:23 - top
849:24 - 52 pixels so now boom it just pushed it
849:28 - down and now I can finally see it
849:31 - let's give it a Max width of 100 percent
849:35 - so
849:36 - okay cool and then um what I'm gonna do
849:40 - inside of content
849:43 - uh let's give it a Max width of 128.
849:49 - this
849:50 - okay let's go down
849:54 - and I'm gonna do margin left
849:57 - Auto
849:58 - and also we're going to give it in
850:00 - margin
850:01 - right
850:04 - um and we're gonna do Auto
850:07 - okay
850:09 - cool
850:10 - and uh inside of section
850:14 - um let's do mid height 50.
850:18 - all right so let's give it that
850:21 - 50 pixels
850:24 - let's give it a padding of 16 pixels
850:29 - a box sizing let's do content box on
850:34 - this
850:35 - cool
850:37 - okay so that just centered Center
850:40 - aligned it
850:41 - all right now it's perfectly smack in
850:44 - the middle of the center
850:46 - uh let's give it a text decoration and
850:48 - we will actually give it an underline
850:52 - okay kind of like an actual link
850:54 - will enable Flex on this and justify
850:59 - content to be in Center
851:02 - okay
851:04 - there we go
851:06 - okay
851:07 - so we'll do media queries here in just a
851:10 - second don't worry for H5 I'm going to
851:13 - give it a special um
851:15 - styling let's go ahead and do this
851:20 - okay give it a little blue for hiring in
851:22 - a hurry that's that right there
851:26 - okay and the a tag inside of here
851:31 - um
851:32 - let's give it a 700
851:36 - beautiful
851:39 - okay let's get in outside of the H5 tag
851:42 - now
851:44 - and uh let's go in to the P tag and
851:47 - style that and I'm gonna say hey give me
851:49 - 14. font size 14.
851:53 - and let's also now do some coloring on
851:57 - this
851:58 - thank you
851:59 - okay great gives me makes it a little
852:03 - bit darker and uh
852:06 - Let's uh make the text Bolder right so
852:10 - 600 makes it pretty bold
852:13 - and then let's get outside of the P tag
852:15 - and finally let's give it a media query
852:18 - so I'm gonna go Max with
852:21 - 768 again mobile devices
852:25 - were you at mobile devices Flex
852:28 - direction we're going to give a column
852:30 - and then padding of course will be Zero
852:34 - by five pixels okay boom there we have
852:38 - it that is looking gorgeous okay
852:41 - beautiful hopefully you got to that with
852:43 - me and let's keep rocking and rolling
852:46 - all right just to blow some of your uh
852:48 - some of yours mines okay so to flex on
852:51 - what this media query does right so for
852:54 - example imagine if I wanted to make this
852:56 - red every time it was in mobile device
852:59 - but like if I went full screen uh it
853:02 - made it um
853:03 - it made it black okay so what I can do
853:07 - is I can actually select because this is
853:09 - a P tag right here so I can actually
853:12 - select this by doing that okay and then
853:15 - how would I make it red think about that
853:17 - how would I make it red all right so
853:21 - color red save okay so now notice that
853:25 - it's in red but when I go full screen
853:27 - mode
853:28 - desktop mode now it's black okay so it's
853:31 - basically saying
853:33 - this again is saying mobile devices do
853:36 - the following now I can also you know if
853:38 - I wanted to do something like font size
853:40 - make the font size 100 x on mobile the
853:43 - font size would be crazy in red and on
853:46 - full screen it would actually be
853:47 - completely normal that's kind of crazy
853:49 - it's almost like you have two different
853:50 - apps right that's pretty freaking cool
853:53 - so
853:54 - um I'm just going to select this P tag
853:56 - and remove it and we should be back to
854:00 - our normal
854:01 - uh healthy looking
854:04 - app all right now what we're going to do
854:07 - is basically we're gonna start to add
854:09 - some of these parts so for example in
854:11 - the finished version you see we have um
854:15 - we have these three things happening
854:17 - over here okay so this is like one this
854:22 - is two and this is three and this is our
854:25 - left side right this is our middle and
854:28 - then this is our right side okay so
854:31 - basically what I'm going to do at this
854:32 - point is I'm going to divide up the page
854:34 - in these three things and I'm gonna use
854:37 - actually grid layout instead of flexbox
854:41 - layout to do this okay so this is going
854:44 - to be really cool let's go ahead and
854:45 - make it happen pal
854:49 - okay so let me go to our our app cool
854:54 - let's go to home.js okay cool we're
854:57 - already here all right so let's go to
855:00 - um let's go right underneath section and
855:02 - right underneath section I'm going to
855:04 - add my component called layout and
855:07 - inside of here I'm going to make a div
855:09 - and call it left side here this is gonna
855:12 - I'm gonna put Main and another div and
855:15 - we'll just say right side
855:18 - okay
855:20 - and again it's complaining I don't know
855:22 - what layout is but this time you know
855:25 - what we need to do okay what do we need
855:26 - to do we need to go downtown
855:30 - and style that damn component const
855:35 - layout
855:37 - style div
855:39 - all right save
855:41 - and then let's go here
855:44 - okay so right now you got left side Main
855:46 - and right side not exactly where we want
855:50 - it but it's a good start
855:52 - and uh here's what we're going to do I'm
855:54 - going to start with display grid
855:58 - okay well that didn't do anything it's
855:59 - okay buddy hold on hang in there
856:03 - all right we're gonna call them the the
856:06 - areas we're gonna call them this left
856:07 - side Main and right side okay
856:11 - boom so it's divided up into three areas
856:15 - all right so now what I want to do is I
856:17 - want to Define how many columns I want
856:20 - right so we're gonna go ahead and do
856:23 - that now so let's go here uh and I'm
856:27 - going to give it columns and I'm just
856:28 - going to say min max give me
856:31 - this okay
856:33 - right there
856:35 - let's go
856:37 - okay
856:39 - and always like click and watch what it
856:42 - does right so right now it's doing
856:44 - something really really bizarre but
856:46 - watch what happens once we're done with
856:47 - the whole freaking thing
856:50 - okay I don't know why I'm an
856:52 - autocomplete always acts so freaking
856:55 - weird
856:56 - okay let's go here min max 300 pixels
857:02 - okay so let's go here
857:05 - um min max zero five okay there we go so
857:10 - now they're like overlapping a little
857:12 - bit but we got left side Main and right
857:14 - side kind of like how I want them but uh
857:18 - a couple of things I want to tell them I
857:19 - want to tell them hey I want to have a
857:21 - column gap of 25 pixels
857:24 - okay
857:25 - cool and
857:27 - um another thing I want is I want a row
857:29 - Gap
857:31 - of 25 pixels okay
857:34 - just make sure we keep refreshing
857:36 - because sometimes The Styling acts a
857:38 - little weird and uh grid template
857:43 - row let's go Auto on this thing
857:47 - cool
857:50 - okay
857:51 - and uh margin I'm gonna go 25 pixels
857:55 - cool so that gave it some margin from
857:58 - the top
857:59 - great and then let's go ahead and again
858:03 - add our media query so what does that
858:06 - mean that means that
858:08 - uh mobile device we want specific things
858:11 - to happen
858:13 - okay
858:14 - display
858:15 - Flex all right Flex direction we're
858:19 - going to make it go column instead of
858:21 - like row by row right so for example
858:24 - here it's going to go like multiple
858:27 - columns
858:28 - okay uh when I go into this now it's
858:33 - like that each row is a column okay just
858:36 - one column per row
858:38 - and um padding we're gonna go zero
858:42 - by five pixels like that cool so we gave
858:46 - it a little push and a shove from
858:48 - touching the screen so much on the left
858:50 - hand side okay and uh with that said
858:53 - we're looking pretty good and that
858:56 - allowed us to divide up the page into
858:58 - three and you know honestly I'm just
859:02 - gonna comment that line out because that
859:03 - line is giving me the creeps with that
859:06 - said this is looking good and let's keep
859:08 - on rocking and rolling okay so so far
859:11 - looking good
859:12 - um now let's actually go ahead and we've
859:15 - divided the page now we're actually
859:17 - going to start making the main and the
859:20 - left and the right components okay so
859:23 - let's go ahead and start doing that uh
859:26 - we're gonna try to keep it pretty
859:28 - freaking simple and pretty pretty
859:31 - um empty for now okay so let's go ahead
859:34 - go inside of components and create a new
859:37 - file and we're going to call this file
859:40 - left side.js
859:44 - um and in left side JS create another
859:48 - component okay called uh inside of
859:50 - components call it main.js and let's
859:53 - also create another component and we'll
859:55 - call it right side.js okay
859:58 - then inside of
860:00 - uh left side just go ahead and do import
860:04 - styled from styled
860:08 - components okay and uh for left side
860:12 - we're going to do the following
860:15 - all right so let's fix this one because
860:17 - we made a little uh
860:20 - typo so just rename and all I'm just
860:23 - make it a small s okay there we go so uh
860:26 - complete const left side I'm gonna have
860:29 - props like this
860:30 - okay and uh return inside of the return
860:34 - we're just gonna put a container in that
860:36 - container just say the word left side
860:38 - like that that's fine
860:40 - okay and
860:43 - we're going to create the style
860:44 - component for this so it doesn't freak
860:46 - out
860:48 - and inside of here we'll do grid area
860:51 - and we'll go left side
860:53 - just like that
860:55 - okay and again export default
861:00 - of sight cool
861:02 - so save save save save save save now
861:04 - we're going to do this let's go to main
861:08 - and um in main I'm gonna paste that code
861:12 - and everywhere it says left side I'm
861:14 - just going to replace it with main
861:16 - that's it
861:18 - okay
861:19 - whoops so let's replace this with Main
861:24 - okay
861:26 - and let's replace that with main cool
861:30 - and this
861:32 - [Music]
861:34 - like that
861:36 - so wherever it says main replace it
861:39 - um and now copy main go to right side
861:42 - paste this code and everywhere it says
861:45 - main you know the drill by this point uh
861:49 - just replace right side
861:51 - replace main with right side
861:55 - okay
861:57 - like that okay and then just go hit save
862:01 - um cool
862:03 - and last thing we want to do is we want
862:05 - to go to home.js
862:07 - okay and under layout
862:10 - we want to replace all of these divs and
862:13 - remove them because we don't need that
862:15 - anymore instead we're just gonna do left
862:19 - side
862:21 - all right
862:23 - and make sure you auto complete it
862:26 - because autocomplete will automatically
862:28 - import it for you as well
862:31 - uh why did it do left side like that oh
862:34 - because
862:37 - um
862:39 - um okay well anyways it's
862:41 - it's left side with the small s like
862:44 - that
862:45 - okay we're also going to do Main
862:48 - just like that
862:50 - close it and then we're also going to do
862:52 - right side
862:55 - make sure that when you write these
862:57 - three that you import these three as
863:00 - well
863:02 - um and now it's saying styled is not
863:05 - defined in any of them
863:08 - well what does that mean so let's go to
863:12 - left side and let's see what it's saying
863:14 - okay so lowercase the style from style
863:16 - components and that should be good to go
863:20 - I believe save
863:22 - go here
863:24 - make it styled with a small s save hit
863:28 - refresh
863:30 - and um yep that's looking great let's
863:33 - hit save like that cool
863:36 - so we're good so far and now let's
863:39 - actually add a art card component on the
863:42 - left hand side all right so let's add
863:45 - the art to the cards now so let's go
863:49 - ahead and do this okay so first things
863:50 - first I'm gonna go to uh let's go to
863:53 - left side because that's where we're
863:55 - gonna actually make this happen and I'm
863:57 - going to create
863:59 - um let's create a style component and
864:02 - I'm going to
864:04 - um
864:04 - which are called Art card okay and let's
864:08 - actually get it started with something
864:10 - in here so instead of saying left side
864:13 - in there I'm going to do art card just
864:16 - like that all right and um within this
864:19 - I'm just gonna say card okay kind of
864:22 - like that so you should have card here
864:24 - okay now inside of this we'll do text
864:27 - align
864:29 - and I'll do Center okay so boom there we
864:32 - go looking good so far foreign
864:37 - now let's go overflow hidden all right
864:41 - so it won't like bleed off the screen
864:43 - onto the sides
864:46 - okay there we go
864:48 - and um
864:50 - let's go background color
864:54 - Boom Like This
864:58 - give it a border radius of 5 pixels
865:02 - cool so now we're starting to look like
865:05 - a card right
865:07 - um
865:09 - and we have that background right there
865:12 - and now the the little radius is coming
865:14 - in that's clean and uh let's give it a
865:17 - little transition
865:19 - box Shadow 83
865:23 - milliseconds okay cool
865:26 - and now let's give it a position
865:28 - relative
865:30 - border I'm gonna give it none okay and
865:35 - um I can give it a complicated looking
865:37 - box shadow
865:39 - but I think I'm just gonna pass on that
865:41 - for now so I'm actually gonna add the
865:44 - Box uh Shadow because I think it does
865:46 - make it kind of look nice and so let's
865:49 - go ahead and do that okay I'm gonna give
865:51 - it a
865:53 - um
865:55 - the only reason sometimes I want to skip
865:56 - it is because it looks like this
865:58 - mysterious code but again a lot of it is
866:00 - auto-generated
866:02 - um you know and even when you should I
866:05 - encourage you to use like online tools
866:07 - for things like box Shadow and stuff
866:08 - like that okay all right so now we got
866:10 - the art card let's go ahead and work on
866:13 - the user information so we're gonna need
866:15 - a couple of things to make that happen
866:17 - all right so now you're gonna need two
866:19 - photos slash SVG files we're gonna need
866:21 - photo this one right here with the
866:23 - camera icon and we're also going to need
866:26 - this card uh background card okay so
866:28 - let's go ahead and take both of these
866:31 - and I'm going to
866:34 - um put them in my yoink okay just
866:38 - there's a place uh right before a pit
866:40 - stop before I drop them into my images
866:42 - so boom just added them right there
866:45 - all right so now that we added those
866:47 - images uh let's go ahead and do
866:49 - something with them so I'm gonna
866:51 - um am I in the left side already okay
866:53 - great I'm in the left side component
866:55 - already perfect now uh inside of my art
866:58 - card just so you have an idea what we're
867:00 - doing we're gonna be building this thing
867:02 - out right here on the left hand side
867:04 - okay so let's go inside of our app that
867:08 - we're working on currently inside of our
867:10 - art card component remove where it says
867:13 - cart instead we're going to create a new
867:15 - component called user info all right I'm
867:18 - gonna hit tab on this and inside of here
867:21 - I'm going to create a new component
867:22 - called background let's say tab on that
867:25 - that should complete it and inside of
867:27 - this
867:29 - um actually let's uh
867:31 - kill the card background
867:35 - right there
867:36 - okay and so inside of user info I'm
867:39 - gonna have card background I'm also
867:40 - going to have a a tag with no href just
867:43 - so I can borrow the a styling and we're
867:47 - going to have photo which is going to be
867:48 - a component
867:50 - and then I'm gonna have link just like
867:53 - this
867:54 - is going to be another component and
867:56 - it's going to say welcome there
867:59 - okay and then I'm just gonna end it so
868:02 - slash and
868:04 - just like that all right so I got user
868:08 - info and then in their card background
868:09 - and the a tag
868:12 - okay
868:13 - now right underneath this a tag I'm
868:16 - going to have another eight tag again
868:19 - with the no href
868:23 - okay it's just like this it's at this a
868:25 - tag and I have add photo text component
868:30 - and that's just going to say add a photo
868:32 - just like that
868:34 - okay now there are tons of components
868:36 - that we need to go and make so let's get
868:38 - go ahead and get started
868:40 - it's like three or four maybe more
868:43 - so let's go user info and I'm just gonna
868:46 - do style div let's leave it empty then
868:49 - we need card background
868:52 - and I'm gonna do something similar which
868:55 - is gonna be styled div let's leave that
868:58 - empty let's go cons photo and
869:02 - let's go here let's leave that empty and
869:06 - then um let's go cons link
869:09 - for the link component
869:12 - and again this is a div we're going to
869:15 - leave it empty for now
869:17 - and add photo text
869:21 - okay let's leave that empty for now as
869:23 - well
869:25 - okay user info is not defined boom
869:28 - welcome there add a photo that's what
869:30 - you should be seeing right now cool so
869:33 - now we're going to start adding all the
869:35 - styling in here so for user info let's
869:37 - get started with that so A couple of
869:40 - things are going to be happening here
869:41 - we're going to give it a border bottom
869:43 - of one pixel solid
869:47 - okay there we go so that gave it a
869:50 - little nice little drop shadow here
869:52 - makes it look beautiful so it's a border
869:55 - bottom I didn't add the Border anywhere
869:57 - else
869:58 - 12 pixel 12 pixels
870:01 - by 16 pixels okay so now this is much
870:06 - more centered we have padding going left
870:08 - we're getting padding going this way and
870:10 - we got padding going that way okay so
870:12 - far so good let's go word wrap and we'll
870:16 - do break word
870:18 - cool
870:19 - and let's go ahead and
870:23 - go ahead and do this cool
870:26 - so
870:28 - Sometimes some of this we might not need
870:30 - honestly but it's okay I'm going to
870:32 - leave it here word break
870:36 - um break
870:38 - word
870:39 - cool
870:42 - okay so let's go ahead and let's keep on
870:47 - going okay
870:49 - inside of my card background
870:53 - we're going to now okay so first of all
870:57 - we're going to add a background image to
870:58 - this okay so let's go background
871:01 - and give it a URL
871:03 - and that's going to be
871:06 - Images slash card
871:09 - background.svg cool close it put a
871:13 - semicolon good hit refresh
871:17 - refresh cool so that image is not
871:20 - showing up but that image is going to
871:21 - start showing up in just a little bit so
871:24 - let's give it a background position of
871:26 - Center
871:29 - let's go give it a background size of
871:32 - 462 pixels
871:36 - let's go give it a height of 54 pixels
871:39 - so now you can start to see that image
871:41 - show up and let's give it a margin of
871:46 - negative 12 negative 12 0. so now that
871:50 - card is starting to look
871:51 - pretty perfect pretty freaking perfect
871:55 - okay pretty and perfect there we go
871:58 - so card background we're good on okay
872:02 - now let's just go ahead and add photo in
872:05 - there so photo is going to require us to
872:07 - do a bit of styling but it's going to
872:09 - look so freaking beautiful when it's
872:11 - done so I'm going to start off with not
872:13 - having any box Shadow uh for background
872:16 - image let's go ahead and choose the
872:18 - photo image so images I'm going to do
872:21 - slash photo.svg
872:24 - okay
872:25 - now we're going to make this thing show
872:27 - up in just a second so let's give it a
872:29 - certain width let's also give it a
872:31 - certain height
872:33 - so now the image is showing up cool now
872:37 - we're going to start making it look
872:38 - better
872:40 - cool height I'm going to give it box
872:42 - sizing
872:44 - border box
872:47 - background clip content box
872:53 - background color let's go white okay
872:58 - background position
873:02 - Center
873:04 - cool
873:05 - so that changed how the image was
873:07 - looking
873:08 - I'm gonna give it a background size of
873:11 - 60 percent beautiful and then we have
873:16 - um
873:18 - background repeat at no repeat actually
873:24 - cool so because we don't want it
873:26 - repeating over and over again we just
873:27 - want one camera
873:30 - and that's how we get it now let's go
873:33 - and do border and for Border we're gonna
873:35 - do two pixels solid white
873:38 - clean
873:40 - okay margin let's give it a margin of 30
873:44 - negative 38 pixels
873:46 - Auto 12 pixel like that
873:49 - damn look at that one line of code and
873:53 - beautifully
873:55 - smacks that in the middle
873:59 - guys like isn't that beautiful when you
874:02 - have these little touches and they all
874:04 - keep adding on and then your front end
874:06 - just
874:08 - just beautiful
874:11 - all right and then uh let's give it a
874:14 - border radius of 50 percent
874:18 - now we got it round nice and round just
874:23 - how we like it
874:24 - okay now let's go inside of our link and
874:27 - make that do good things let's go 16
874:31 - pixels for the font size
874:34 - line height
874:36 - will go 1.5 okay that added some line
874:41 - height to this okay
874:44 - foreign
874:45 - let's go here and go color and we'll
874:48 - change the color just a little bit
874:50 - so we're gonna go zero zero zero zero
874:55 - point nine
874:57 - cool
874:58 - and then after that we're just going to
875:01 - choose the font way to be kind of
875:03 - boldish okay let's go 600 so welcome
875:06 - there boom
875:08 - a little bold man looks so nice right on
875:11 - the left hand side is looking beautiful
875:13 - when I go in this mode it looks great
875:15 - and mobile you know most people get lazy
875:19 - on the mobile but not us we make sure
875:22 - that that mobile version
875:25 - is uh
875:27 - is looking clutch you know is it
875:30 - distracting when I'm in the center
875:32 - probably I'll just keep myself to the
875:34 - side for now okay all right so that that
875:38 - looks great okay and then add photo to
875:42 - text add photo text
875:45 - let's go give it a color and let's start
875:48 - off with this
875:50 - okay cool we got a little blue
875:52 - action going on let's give some margin
875:56 - from the top so give it a little
875:58 - separation from welcome there right it
875:59 - was way too close and feeling a little
876:01 - uncomfortable and we got it out of there
876:04 - give it a little font size of 12 pixels
876:07 - line height
876:08 - uh again line height gives things some
876:12 - nice breathing room so it just does not
876:15 - hurt and then we'll give it a font
876:17 - weight of 400 makes it just a little bit
876:19 - Tad tad bit darker if we go 700 that's a
876:23 - little too much but 400 is just
876:26 - just right and just enough so perfect
876:29 - that's looking great now let's add a
876:32 - widget component inside of our art card
876:35 - okay so let's go ahead and do that now
876:40 - all right now let's work on our widget
876:43 - okay so first things first we're going
876:45 - to go inside of our uh left side
876:49 - component great and then here I want to
876:52 - add my widget okay so right underneath
876:54 - the user info I'm going to add this
876:58 - widget right there just like that okay
877:00 - this is going to be a widget component
877:02 - open up the a tag
877:04 - okay and then we're gonna create a div
877:08 - inside of that div I'm going to have
877:10 - some span tags so spandex
877:15 - and this is gonna say
877:16 - the first span tag is going to say
877:19 - connections
877:21 - and then the next span tag is going to
877:24 - say grow your network
877:26 - just like that
877:28 - okay now I need to close that a tag
877:31 - that's why it's complaining
877:33 - great
877:35 - and uh I need to actually add an SVG
877:38 - inside of that so what I'm going to do
877:40 - is I'm going to copy this SVG that I'm
877:42 - adding okay and um we're gonna call it
877:46 - the
877:47 - Widget icon
877:50 - all right so I'm going to go inside of
877:53 - my
877:54 - so let's take this Widget icon right
877:57 - over here okay and I'm simply going to
878:01 - add that to my images so drag and drop
878:06 - cool so now once you have that SVG
878:09 - SVG we're also going to add in our item
878:13 - icon okay that's another one we're gonna
878:15 - need so this item icon one little
878:18 - bookmark looking thing okay so let's
878:21 - also get that and add that to our images
878:24 - so drag
878:27 - drop cool so we got that SVG going now
878:31 - let's go back to our left side and
878:33 - here's what we're gonna do okay inside
878:34 - of this a tag inside of this um actually
878:39 - where are we planning to add this where
878:42 - am I planning to add this so let's see
878:45 - here
878:47 - we got
878:50 - where's my div action going on
878:52 - grow your network so right underneath
878:55 - grow your network
878:57 - um
878:58 - this actually needs to be wrapped up in
879:01 - a div I believe
879:04 - okay
879:05 - so
879:06 - let's go here
879:08 - yeah so this this needs to get wrapped
879:10 - up in a div okay boom just let's do it
879:13 - like that
879:15 - okay so widget a tag div span cool
879:21 - and um right outside
879:24 - of this div ending is where we're gonna
879:26 - make our magic happen
879:29 - okay so let's go outside of this div and
879:33 - I'm going to do image and the image
879:36 - source is going to be
879:38 - that SVG file that we talked that we
879:41 - just added okay and afterward the widget
879:45 - ends we're going to add in another
879:47 - component called item within that we're
879:49 - going to have a span tag within that
879:51 - we're going to have another image or a
879:54 - image and that's going to be slash
879:56 - images item
879:59 - hyphen
880:00 - icon.svg okay and just so you have some
880:04 - idea what is happening is we're going to
880:06 - be doing a lot of this stuff so we're
880:07 - going to be adding this we're going to
880:09 - be adding this okay so there's a bunch
880:11 - of stuff happening like that
880:13 - so hang in there Buttercup it'll be
880:16 - great and if you're watching this and
880:18 - you're enjoying this so far do your
880:20 - friend a favor and smash smash that like
880:23 - button and keep that energy high in here
880:26 - okay I love your beautiful face and
880:28 - let's keep going
880:29 - okay so widget we're gonna need
880:34 - um
880:34 - just create a style component okay
880:38 - and just for you guys I didn't do an
880:39 - ASMR version okay because you guys
880:42 - didn't like that very much so let's go
880:44 - ahead and uh let's add in a widget just
880:47 - like this
880:48 - and we're gonna do two things we're
880:50 - gonna add in widget and we're gonna add
880:52 - an item
880:53 - cool
880:55 - so widget component just in the start
880:57 - was going to be styled div I'm going to
881:00 - leave it empty and then also let's add
881:04 - in um for item
881:06 - okay let's go
881:08 - item is going to be a styled a
881:12 - and just start off with empty
881:15 - so let's put slash here by the way that
881:18 - was a little typo so boom slash not Dash
881:21 - cool so now both of the images should be
881:24 - here right there okay if I full screen
881:26 - this thing you should see them
881:28 - connections grow your network and we got
881:31 - both of our images
881:34 - right cool
881:36 - okay so let's go ahead all the way down
881:39 - and start styling this uh widget okay so
881:43 - that's gonna take a second actually to
881:45 - style because there's a couple of things
881:46 - happening here
881:48 - let's go about border bottom one pixel
881:50 - solid
881:52 - all right
881:55 - beautiful
881:57 - uh let's add some padding to the top of
882:00 - this thing
882:01 - cool and let's add some padding to the
882:04 - bottom of this thing
882:06 - beautiful let's go ahead
882:11 - and uh style the a tags
882:16 - inside of this thing and I'm gonna give
882:18 - it a text decoration of uh
882:22 - of none
882:24 - let's go display Flex because we're
882:27 - gonna need that justify content
882:31 - and I want to give it
882:33 - space between okay so you saw how this
882:37 - thing got pushed right that's kind of
882:39 - what we want this on the left side this
882:40 - on the right side and there's space in
882:42 - between that's why we write that
882:46 - align items Center
882:50 - and we're going to give it some padding
882:53 - cool
882:55 - okay so on Hover it gets darker and it
882:58 - kind of gets highlighted okay whoops my
883:01 - face is blocking pretty much everything
883:05 - great
883:07 - so when I hover
883:09 - boom boom looking pretty magnificent my
883:13 - friend
883:14 - uh background color
883:17 - on Hover we got some action going on
883:19 - okay now let's go under hover
883:23 - and let's do something okay so just go
883:26 - display Flex
883:28 - and we'll go flex Direction and we'll go
883:31 - column
883:32 - okay so connections and grow your
883:34 - network got written out on separate
883:36 - lines because this is a span tag this is
883:39 - a span tag and because of doing column
883:42 - they both got pushed onto their own
883:44 - columns
883:45 - let's go attacks a line and we'll go
883:49 - left so now connections and grow your
883:51 - network are you know evened out more
883:55 - and within this let's uh style our span
883:59 - tags even further so let's go give it
884:01 - font size of 12 pixels a little bit
884:03 - smaller
884:05 - let's give it a line height of
884:08 - 1.33333
884:10 - so we got some spacing going on in
884:13 - between some room to breathe
884:16 - it's like when I'm sleeping with my
884:18 - girlfriend and I just want to like not
884:19 - spoon for a second you know I'm
884:21 - basically giving a little line height in
884:23 - between
884:24 - because sometimes it just gets way too
884:26 - hot
884:28 - um first child
884:31 - uh AKA Monet's first I'm kidding
884:34 - all right here we go let's give it a
884:36 - color or GBA
884:39 - it's a it's one of the members on our
884:41 - team and
884:42 - I don't know if we're supposed to say
884:44 - this on YouTube but she's having a baby
884:46 - so we're excited we're super excited for
884:48 - her we're pumped we're super happy let's
884:51 - go here let's go ahead and uh
884:55 - let's go 0.06
884:58 - beautiful
885:00 - and then underneath the first child
885:04 - let's go with a nth
885:08 - child
885:09 - whoops whoops whoops whoops whoops
885:13 - and child just like that
885:16 - and let's give it
885:19 - what happened here
885:21 - just like that
885:23 - okay there we go
885:25 - so now these styled things have certain
885:29 - ways of how they're colored okay so
885:32 - that's good
885:35 - and uh let's close out of all of this
885:38 - and then the last thing we want to do is
885:40 - we want to give certain styling to SVG
885:43 - hopefully that actually does something
885:45 - cool
885:48 - um so there we go so now this component
885:50 - is looking really beautiful I mean like
885:52 - look at it right on the left hand side
885:55 - connections grow your network
885:58 - that little icon right there I mean just
886:01 - fine little touches and this entire app
886:04 - is coming along so freaking well I mean
886:07 - like just look at this thing right it's
886:09 - beautiful
886:11 - so that's great now we're gonna go ahead
886:15 - and style our item component right
886:18 - because that's another one that we were
886:20 - gonna do so let's go ahead and do that
886:23 - one okay where's item component item
886:25 - component has the item icon so I imagine
886:29 - it's this one
886:30 - but hopefully we're not wrong
886:33 - let's go
886:35 - let's give it a border color whoops
886:38 - and technically those correct code
886:43 - um okay that
886:46 - text align it to the left
886:49 - I mean do we even have text in there
886:52 - oh yeah let's go ahead and add text in
886:54 - there okay so let's go to let's go to
886:57 - our item we have span and we have an
886:59 - image and right underneath this we'll
887:01 - say my items okay just like that
887:05 - so what did left a line do let's see if
887:08 - I delete that line what happens
887:09 - absolutely nothing perfect great just
887:12 - how I like my styling to do things
887:16 - um
887:17 - padding let's give it 12 pixels
887:20 - font size
887:23 - 12 pixels is great
887:26 - and then let's go display block
887:30 - okay nice so now
887:33 - it's looking perfect
887:36 - um I want to give it a certain let's
887:38 - let's work on the span a little bit so
887:42 - first things first I'm going to start it
887:44 - off with enabling Flex on it and then
887:47 - let's go and vertically align everything
887:49 - with the line items
887:51 - play with the color just a little bit
887:55 - it just makes it kind of like a dark
887:57 - black
888:00 - okay and then let's get out of here
888:04 - right there
888:06 - and on Hover I wanna change the color
888:12 - just like that okay boom boom boom boom

891:08 - and then right underneath that I'm gonna
891:11 - have another a tag
891:13 - that says span and they'll say discover
891:17 - more just like this
891:19 - okay so we have one a tag two three and
891:25 - four
891:26 - each a tag has one span tag one two
891:31 - three four so four a tags four span tags
891:35 - got it everything inside of the
891:38 - community card cool
891:40 - good
891:42 - all right so now let's go ahead and make
891:45 - our styled component called Community
891:47 - card
891:49 - so let's go
891:51 - and let's have it borrow from styled
891:54 - card let's hit save
891:57 - and Community card is not defined cool
891:59 - there we go
892:00 - so now we got this ugly looking thing
892:02 - right here but hey at least it's right
892:04 - here and it's ours so that's good
892:07 - plus sign
892:08 - so now let's go inside of this thing and
892:11 - let's start working on it so let's add
892:13 - some padding
892:14 - cool that gives it some breathing room
892:16 - let's text align everything to be on the
892:19 - left that's better let's make it display
892:22 - flex and you know what and I'm gonna
892:26 - give it a Gonna Make It Go in columns
892:30 - cool aha
892:32 - looking way better clean
892:35 - let's go down and uh let's start styling
892:38 - the attack so let's select the eight
892:40 - eight tags now color
892:42 - black cool
892:45 - my girlfriend's favorite color
892:48 - uh let's go like this
892:50 - boom that padding gives it nice
892:54 - breathing room from the left and from
892:56 - the top
892:58 - Let's uh play with the font size and
893:00 - give it 12 pixels and then I'm going to
893:03 - do vertical a line on this thing and
893:07 - let's see if it actually does anything
893:09 - I don't even think we need this thing
893:11 - Okay cool so let's just leave that out
893:13 - for now
893:14 - because otherwise it just gets confusing
893:17 - cool
893:18 - let's go and go on Hover let's add some
893:22 - functionality to it so let's make the
893:24 - color go
893:26 - and do the that
893:28 - blue thing okay so when I hover over it
893:30 - each one of these highlights
893:33 - yeah boom boom boom
893:36 - great
893:37 - okay cool now under hover what I want to
893:41 - do is let's go to our span and let's go
893:44 - display Flex let's go align items
893:49 - and I'm going to vertically Center great
893:52 - so now events is looking good because
893:54 - before it was looking stupid with the
893:56 - plus sign let's go justify content and
894:01 - I'm gonna go space between
894:04 - cool so now that plus sign has a space
894:07 - between
894:09 - and it gives it nice little breathing
894:11 - room there
894:13 - okay
894:14 - let's get out of the span tag and uh
894:17 - we're gonna grab
894:18 - the last child
894:22 - okay and we're gonna give it a color
894:26 - okay we're gonna make that gray
894:28 - text decoration of course is none
894:32 - border top let's go one pixel solid with
894:37 - this color I think
894:40 - cool so
894:42 - this border top has done that thing
894:46 - right there that like line that
894:48 - partition that we got
894:50 - okay
894:51 - so and underneath this I'm going to add
894:54 - some padding
894:56 - great
894:58 - and let's add in a little hover
895:02 - and 0.08 cool
895:06 - oh too dark
895:09 - let's lighten that up 0.08 baby yeah
895:12 - blue blue blue hover nice
895:17 - man this is looking freaking slick
895:20 - search bar looks great my icon here
895:23 - looks great
895:25 - the front end is
895:28 - looking
895:29 - it's looking good
895:31 - looking pretty freaking good
895:34 - okay
895:37 - all right I'm in like 200 zoom on my
895:39 - screen but you know so yours might look
895:41 - slightly different but that's okay
895:44 - all right so really good progress here
895:46 - and uh
895:48 - uh I think let's keep on going all right
895:50 - so next up um let's go and add the
895:54 - follow card component on the right hand
895:57 - side well what is that what is that
895:59 - Causey it's going to be um some of this
896:02 - all right the follow component so let's
896:05 - start working on this thing now boom so
896:08 - let's go add follow card component so
896:10 - I'm gonna go to my right side component
896:12 - now and inside of my right card
896:14 - component I'm going to remove what we
896:17 - have here and instead I'm going to add a
896:20 - new component called follow card okay so
896:23 - inside of my container I'm gonna have a
896:25 - follow card component now inside of here
896:27 - I'm just going to write the text right
896:28 - side and of course it's gonna complain
896:31 - it doesn't know what it is no worries
896:33 - we're going to create a follow card
896:36 - component now or style component now
896:39 - okay so so far it should just be saying
896:42 - right side and not really doing anything
896:44 - okay no worries now let's go text the
896:46 - line let's go text a line
896:48 - and we'll go Center uh overflow Let's Go
896:53 - hidden okay
896:55 - great
896:57 - um let's go and add margin bottom eight
897:00 - pixels
897:02 - background color
897:05 - okay so now the right side is having a
897:08 - little like border radius around it okay
897:10 - it's at the bottom we'll fix that but
897:12 - that's what you should be having so I
897:14 - just zoomed out a little bit from my app
897:16 - right side should be there on your
897:18 - mobile type of view and on full screen
897:21 - view
897:22 - um right side should be kind of at the
897:24 - bottom right right now Okay cool so uh
897:28 - we added a little border radius that
897:30 - gave it the rounded Corners let's go
897:33 - ahead and do position
897:35 - relative
897:37 - and let's go border none and I'm gonna
897:42 - give it a box Shadow and let's go like
897:46 - this with our box shadow
897:49 - okay
897:50 - mysterious mysterious box Shadow and
897:54 - then padding we're gonna go 12 pixels
897:57 - cool so now right side should be kind of
898:00 - a lot more visible and much bigger
898:03 - okay
898:05 - all right I have to zoom out a little
898:07 - bit and get 225 percent and that's that
898:09 - allows me to see it okay now we're going
898:12 - to add a title inside of our card so
898:15 - let's get our feed icon and we're going
898:18 - to put that in images because that's
898:19 - what we're going to need now
898:21 - cool so with that icon on the way let's
898:25 - go back to right side and um inside here
898:29 - we're gonna add that since I'll go let's
898:31 - go where we had the word right side
898:33 - written and remove it and instead we'll
898:36 - replace it with a component called title
898:39 - and inside of this component I'm going
898:40 - to add a H2 and this H2 is going to say
898:44 - add to your feed let's hit save so it
898:46 - auto formats it I have prettier
898:49 - extension you can get the prettier
898:51 - extension
898:52 - from here if you want your auto
898:55 - completion to work and on also for auto
898:58 - completion to work you should go to your
899:01 - um workspace settings okay so just go to
899:05 - your settings how do I even get to my

899:10 - format
899:12 - and do default formatter prettier and
899:15 - also format on Save
899:18 - so once you do that your formatting
899:20 - should start to work okay cool
899:24 - um so add title now inside of our title
899:27 - I have my h2 tag and underneath that I'm
899:31 - going to add my image and my image
899:33 - source is going to be this one right
899:36 - here and all the way at the bottom we're
899:39 - going to now add the styled styling for

903:37 - items Center great it's looking good
903:41 - margin will give it a 12 pixel
903:44 - so that gave it again some Breathing
903:46 - Room between LinkedIn and the word video
903:50 - I'm gonna give it a position that's
903:52 - relative

911:18 - right so um this is a small typo okay so
911:21 - it's right side lower case okay and that
911:26 - actually brings that to the top right
911:28 - okay so make sure you have that right
911:31 - all right that ad image is acting a
911:33 - little funny so we're just gonna keep
911:34 - going and then we're gonna have that
911:36 - image show up okay but for now uh the
911:39 - banner card I'm not gonna worry about it

912:08 - be Center I'm gonna overflow hidden
912:12 - margin bottom all right this is going to
912:15 - be helpful for the share box in just a
912:17 - second but just um let's keep going with
912:20 - this hang in there with me and it'll
912:22 - make sense very very soon okay so we're
912:24 - gonna basically add in margin bottom
912:27 - eight pixels to this thing background
912:29 - color and we're gonna we're gonna
912:31 - actually inherit from this okay because
912:33 - it's going to be our common styling and
912:35 - then we're gonna inherit from this card
912:39 - um let's go border radius and go five
912:42 - pixels I'll go position relative
912:46 - border none and then we're gonna do the
912:49 - Box Shadow game of that RGB that
912:55 - and
912:57 - cool so now we got our box Shadow our
913:01 - box Shadow is good to go and uh let's go
913:04 - ahead and actually start using this okay
913:06 - so I'm gonna go into my container let's
913:08 - remove Main and instead of main we're
913:10 - going to create a new component called
913:12 - share box inside of sharebox I'm just
913:14 - going to write in the word share and
913:16 - then let's create a styling for share
913:20 - box so const share box and I'm gonna go
913:24 - and inherit I want to inherit my styling
913:28 - from common card okay and then let's go
913:33 - and do display Flex Flex Direction I'm
913:37 - gonna go column
913:38 - okay and uh now we got the share
913:42 - component showing up right over here
913:44 - okay that's perfect that's what we want
913:45 - the share to be showing up right in the
913:48 - middle
913:49 - color
913:51 - okay so that gives it a very light gray
913:55 - I'm gonna margin like this cool and then
913:59 - background white
914:01 - okay so share box is looking good we're
914:06 - inheriting the share box features uh
914:09 - from our other component called common

919:07 - article
919:08 - we got the whole shebang in here okay
919:10 - cool
919:12 - and then what we got to do is we gotta
919:14 - start adding styling to it so let's go
919:16 - to our share box and underneath our
919:19 - share box where we added background
919:21 - white we're going to add an additional
919:23 - styling okay so let's create a let's
919:25 - create a select the div not create
919:28 - and uh for div we're gonna style the
919:31 - buttons like so and these autocompletes
919:33 - are painful
919:36 - so this button is going to have the
919:37 - styling of outline
919:39 - none
919:41 - cool underneath here we're gonna have
919:44 - color
919:45 - okay
919:47 - font size let's give it a 14 pixels
919:51 - right
919:53 - all right so underneath this let's do
919:56 - mid height of 48 pixels
920:00 - cool
920:02 - background transparent
920:05 - okay so caught the caught the
920:10 - crazy thing all right so share box make
920:13 - sure the whole freaking thing is wrapped
920:15 - in share box okay now that's the error
920:17 - okay this is why it's important to catch
920:19 - these errors boom
920:21 - okay now
920:24 - um if I uncomment this out because I
920:26 - commented it right now because I was
920:27 - like there's literally no difference
920:28 - that's happening okay so let's just go
920:30 - line by line here and see
920:32 - uh oops let's just comment well comments
920:36 - that's the whole um thing at once so
920:39 - let's try it like that okay so I'm gonna
920:42 - uncomment this
920:44 - color okay that made it a little bit
920:46 - gray I think you can see that right that
920:48 - made a little bit Gray okay now
920:51 - that made the font size a little bit
920:53 - bigger right
920:55 - uh line height
920:57 - cold I give it a little height cool
920:59 - let's go mid height
921:01 - boom we got a midnight action going on
921:04 - and uh lastly
921:07 - but not leastly let's make the
921:10 - background transparent okay so clear
921:12 - clear that out great now we're going to
921:15 - add a couple of more things to this okay
921:17 - cool so now under background we're gonna
921:20 - make sure that border
921:23 - is none
921:25 - okay so now the border is gone and it's
921:27 - starting to look a lot better yeah so
921:30 - boom that's that's looking beautiful
921:33 - let's go display Flex
921:35 - nice that looks a lot more beautiful now
921:39 - clean
921:40 - and then let's go align items Center
921:45 - nice
921:46 - font weight should be 600
921:51 - yeah that looks great that looks great
921:56 - all right we're doing good
921:59 - now underneath this button
922:01 - let's get into the first child
922:04 - and uh display Flex
922:08 - okay so we're starting to control that
922:10 - image a little bit
922:12 - align items
922:14 - Center
922:16 - okay
922:17 - let's go padding
922:20 - nice some more control on that uh image
922:24 - it's always a good sign
922:26 - now we're gonna get into really
922:28 - controlling that image
922:32 - already looking better baby
922:36 - uh border
922:38 - radius of course fifty percent will give
922:41 - it that nice circular feel
922:44 - and then margin right eight pixels
922:48 - aha look at that we're getting we're
922:52 - getting somewhere with that now we're
922:53 - getting somewhere with that now
922:56 - so let's get out of that image now
922:59 - and uh
923:01 - now let's dig into the button okay
923:07 - okay so you saw what margin did right it
923:09 - gave it more margin from the top in this
923:11 - case we're gonna have Flex grow one
923:15 - and then let's go border radius 35
923:19 - pixels
923:21 - cool
923:24 - okay
923:25 - and uh let's go on and go padding
923:30 - left
923:32 - my bad left 16 pixels cool
923:38 - okay so far so good
923:41 - let's go border one pixel solid and then
923:45 - we're gonna
923:46 - essentially give it that color right
923:49 - there
923:50 - okay so now you can see start a post
923:53 - actually has a little border around it
923:55 - right
923:56 - and how did that happen so for example
923:58 - if I remove border radius now look it
924:00 - looks square
924:01 - but if I put that border radius there
924:03 - boom it's looking nice and
924:06 - circular like that okay
924:09 - now let's add
924:11 - background color
924:14 - and we'll add white cool and then text a
924:19 - line and I'm going to text align
924:21 - everything to be left
924:23 - great
924:25 - great great great great great
924:28 - okay and now let's get out of here
924:31 - and let's deal with the nth child
924:35 - uh-huh looks like that
924:39 - all right and we'll go display Flex
924:44 - he has so beautiful it's coming together
924:49 - Flex wrap wrap
924:52 - beautiful
924:54 - justify content
924:58 - base around so we'll give space around
925:06 - looks clean
925:08 - okay
925:10 - and then underneath here we'll go
925:12 - padding
925:14 - bottom
925:16 - okay so you saw how it gave it some
925:19 - breathing room from here right there
925:21 - give it breathing room right there
925:23 - okay and then the button the buttons
925:27 - here
925:29 - image uh the
925:31 - the image inside of the buttons
925:35 - okay let's go ahead and control that
925:37 - zero
925:40 - cool
925:41 - that controls it that's great
925:44 - great
925:45 - so
925:46 - so take a look at the images right here
925:49 - these images but when I add that line
925:51 - now those images have some margin from
925:54 - the text because they were initially way
925:56 - too close
925:58 - all right now let's get outside of that
926:01 - image
926:03 - and let's deal with span
926:06 - and here
926:09 - boom and now we got the beautiful blue
926:13 - action going on
926:16 - amazing
926:18 - amazing you guys
926:20 - okay that was
926:23 - um absolutely incredible work and
926:27 - um you know I just want to say that I'm
926:30 - proud of you for getting up to here and
926:33 - making such great progress so far you've
926:36 - been absolutely amazing but we're not
926:38 - done yet and we got a lot of way to go
926:41 - for example you know we I mean as
926:43 - amazing as this is looking already right
926:46 - and I bet you even completely forgot we
926:49 - actually have a freaking home page right
926:52 - which is completely mobile responsive by
926:54 - the way okay and if I hit slash home now
926:58 - we get redirected to home right so this
927:01 - is all the front end functionality and
927:02 - this is great but remember we still need
927:05 - to add more things to it like for
927:07 - example we still need to be able to add
927:09 - Firebase to it so we have login and
927:11 - logout functionality from the home page
927:13 - we still need to be able to add uh react
927:17 - router redirecting you on login to to
927:20 - this page and then we need to add more
927:24 - functionality around
927:26 - being able to write a post so we're
927:29 - going to need a modal we're going to be
927:31 - able to we're going to need to be able
927:32 - to add text in that modal and then add
927:35 - images in there and add videos in there
927:37 - and then we're gonna need to be able to
927:39 - store that inside of Firebase and then
927:40 - we're going to need to
927:42 - be able to read that from Firebase and
927:44 - show all of it here and then we're going
927:46 - to need to write react code that can
927:48 - show those components and everything in
927:50 - a beautiful way okay so we're doing
927:52 - great so far but we got a long way to go
927:55 - so hang tight you're doing fantastic

929:58 - um let's go over to our main JS where
930:00 - we're at right now I'm gonna zoom out
930:02 - just a little bit because that was a
930:04 - little too close and claustrophobic for
930:06 - comfort
930:08 - and let's go right underneath the share
930:11 - box
930:12 - okay so where is it let's go to main
930:15 - and I'll go right underneath the share
930:18 - box where sharebox is ending and let's
930:20 - open up a div and inside of this div I'm
930:22 - going to add an article okay and inside
930:25 - of this article I'm just gonna say
930:27 - article like so okay and let's hit
930:30 - refresh now it says it's not defined
930:33 - because we need to make a styling for
930:35 - that component
930:37 - okay so let's go ahead const article
930:41 - and again I can do styled and I'm gonna
930:46 - copy from the common card
930:49 - okay so let's go like this
930:51 - beautiful now we have an article right

932:10 - to do is we're gonna go inside of our
932:12 - main and we're gonna do a couple of
932:14 - things okay let's go inside of our
932:17 - article component that we made and we're
932:20 - gonna remove what we put inside of there
932:22 - all right simply because we're gonna
932:23 - change that bad boy up and add a new
932:26 - component called shared actor okay and
932:30 - inside of this shared actor I'm going to
932:33 - make a link tag now
932:36 - I don't actually need the link I just
932:39 - need to borrow the styling so I'm just
932:40 - gonna leave it like this and I'm gonna
932:42 - give it an image and we're going to give
932:45 - it a user.sme where the F where does it
932:48 - start typing
932:49 - okay
932:52 - like so
932:54 - okay
932:56 - and uh so that's pretty good as long as
932:59 - our a tag and image is concerned now
933:01 - inside of this a tag I'm going to also
933:03 - add another div
933:04 - okay and this div is going to have span
933:09 - and I'm gonna have title
933:13 - after title I'll have info
933:16 - okay capitalize the title T and then
933:19 - we're gonna have date just like so
933:23 - underneath this a tag I'm going to add a
933:26 - button that button is going to have an
933:28 - image and we're going to give it an
933:30 - ellipsis
933:31 - uh and image
933:34 - SVG okay now it's complaining it's like
933:37 - yeah I don't know what the shared actor
933:38 - is no problem const shared actor
933:43 - okay just like that we're gonna give it
933:45 - a style div make it empty and save and
933:48 - refresh and it should be defined now
933:50 - okay so now we see title info date right
933:53 - next to each other very uncomfortably
933:56 - close with the three dots okay great so
934:00 - let's start adding some styling to it
934:02 - and make it look good
934:04 - okay make it look good in the hood
934:08 - like you should let's go and do that
934:10 - okay for the shared actor so now that's
934:12 - going to require a lot of styling hang
934:15 - in there
934:16 - let's give it padding right of 40 pixels
934:19 - oops cannot see it
934:21 - cool let's go down and I'm going to give
934:25 - it if Lex wrap and we'll do no wrap on
934:29 - this thing okay and just make sure the
934:31 - whole thing is wrapped and shared or
934:33 - shared actor just like that
934:38 - okay
934:39 - padding I want to give it 12 pixel by 16
934:42 - pixels by zero
934:45 - cool
934:46 - okay whoops
934:51 - all right
934:54 - let's see
934:58 - okay this is where we have it it's
935:01 - looking good
935:03 - we got some padding going now let's uh
935:06 - do a couple of more things to it okay
935:07 - I'm gonna add margin to bottom
935:10 - let's go like this and add some margin
935:13 - and uh underneath that let's go align
935:16 - items
935:18 - Center
935:20 - cool
935:23 - and let's keep going all right so now
935:26 - let's go ahead and add under align items
935:30 - I'm going to make sure my display is
935:32 - flex okay cool starting to look pretty
935:36 - okay sometimes certain things don't
935:37 - happen but I promise they take some time
935:40 - and then they come together
935:42 - cool so we got display Flex now
935:44 - underneath here let's style our
935:46 - a tag akr link tag and I'm going to give
935:50 - it a margin right of 12 pixels okay so
935:53 - now that button moved just a little bit
935:56 - to the right that's beautiful
935:58 - now make sure you keep hitting save for
936:01 - the changes to take place
936:04 - so that gives it margin great now let's
936:07 - go flex grow we'll do one on this
936:11 - all right beautiful damage is taken up a
936:15 - lot of that nice
936:17 - and uh now I'm gonna do overflow
936:20 - hidden
936:23 - cool
936:25 - and then let's do display Flex
936:29 - okay
936:32 - whoops did not mean to do that
936:36 - all right so now you should have the
936:37 - image here the three dots to the right
936:40 - just like that and then if I full screen
936:43 - it it should still look very similar to
936:45 - this
936:46 - okay cool let's keep on going now
936:50 - underneath it this again doesn't really
936:53 - matter that much but I just like to do
936:56 - it just to be safe
936:57 - that no links have any text decoration
937:01 - just because it's annoying
937:03 - let's go inside here and now let's dial
937:07 - the image tag that's inside of the link
937:09 - tag
937:10 - and I'll give it a width of 48.
937:13 - pixels
937:16 - nice and I will give it a height of 48
937:19 - pixels
937:22 - cool
937:24 - so now what you see is that right there
937:27 - [Music]
937:29 - okay so you should see title info date
937:31 - and the three dots great
937:35 - now let's get outside of this image
937:37 - and we will select our div and let's go
937:43 - display Flex
937:46 - cool Flex direction will go column
937:51 - so now title info date should be each On
937:54 - Their Own Line
937:56 - okay
937:59 - um
938:00 - let's go flex grow
938:03 - one on this awesome so now title info
938:08 - date should be in the middle
938:10 - okay
938:14 - and we'll do Flex bases
938:17 - of zero
938:18 - all right so we got the flex bases now
938:21 - let's go margin uh left on this thing
938:24 - and we'll go eight pixels for margin so
938:28 - that gave it just a tiny little margin
938:30 - you'll see it move a little bit and I'm
938:33 - gonna go overflow hidden again
938:35 - cool so we don't want to see any type of
938:38 - weird overflow happening
938:40 - and span let's control the span now so
938:43 - text align I'm going to say left
938:47 - so now title info date should be right
938:50 - up next to the image
938:55 - let's grab the first
938:59 - child
939:02 - okay and then we'll go font size 14
939:05 - pixels cool
939:08 - makes it a little bit smaller we'll make
939:10 - it now bolder
939:14 - with font weight and again first child
939:17 - is that text right here
939:21 - okay
939:23 - [Music]
939:27 - and then let's give it a color and we'll
939:30 - go
939:31 - zero zero zero one
939:35 - okay so that makes it just a little bit
939:37 - uh darker
939:39 - okay then outside of this span tag what
939:43 - we're gonna do
939:44 - actually we're still inside of the span
939:47 - but we're outside of the first child
939:49 - right so inside of this span tag let's
939:53 - also style another element so I'm gonna
939:56 - go
939:58 - um basically this means this thing that
940:01 - you're styling all right so that and is
940:03 - referring to this shared actor style div
940:07 - so I'm saying this divs
940:10 - um nth child
940:15 - and I'm gonna go n plus one
940:19 - foreign
940:21 - and let's go font size 12 pixels
940:26 - cool
940:27 - and then we'll go
940:30 - color
940:34 - great
940:36 - so now
940:38 - the whole thing is just a little bit
940:40 - Gray
940:41 - okay so that's pretty good now we're
940:45 - gonna go outside of pretty much all of
940:48 - that and we're gonna style a button
940:49 - component on its own so we're gonna go
940:52 - outside of all of these squigglies
940:55 - and we'll now style the button component
940:57 - and we'll say position absolute
941:02 - so now the button should be
941:04 - hovering right over the photo
941:07 - we'll say right by 12 pixels
941:10 - cool top of zero
941:12 - nice
941:14 - background transparent
941:18 - like so
941:20 - border will go none
941:23 - outline will go none
941:26 - so now there's no boxes around it
941:31 - now there's no boxes around that
941:33 - Ellipsis right it's just Ellipsis by
941:35 - itself
941:37 - and uh that's it on the when it comes to
941:41 - this component for now this is pretty
941:43 - good and now let's keep on going all
941:45 - right now let's add description and a
941:47 - shared image okay that's what we're
941:49 - calling it so let's go and find her and
941:52 - this is the image that I want you to use
941:54 - okay this is we'll make a random post so
941:58 - that's the image
942:00 - and uh cool now let's go to our main
942:03 - after we got that image and now let's
942:06 - start actually working on this okay so
942:10 - what we need to do at this point is we
942:12 - need to find where our shared actor
942:14 - component is which is right here
942:17 - underneath our shared actor component we
942:21 - need to now add a new component and
942:24 - we're going to call that component
942:26 - description
942:30 - inside of description I'll just say the
942:32 - text description
942:34 - just like that that's it
942:37 - okay
942:38 - so
942:39 - that's good
942:41 - uh let's see
942:44 - what is happening here cool cool now
942:47 - underneath description we're gonna add
942:50 - one more thing we're going to add a new
942:52 - component and it's going to be called
942:53 - shared image just like this
942:56 - and inside of here we're going to have
942:58 - an a tag that's going to be empty
943:01 - and inside of this a tag we're gonna
943:03 - have an image
943:05 - like so
943:07 - shared image.jpg
943:12 - okay so again description
943:14 - [Music]
943:16 - boom
943:17 - again it's complaining that it doesn't
943:19 - know what those style components are no
943:21 - worries we'll add them in right now so
943:24 - let's go add a description
943:28 - that
943:29 - [Music]
943:39 - boom beautiful
943:41 - here we go
943:43 - that image is just out of control right
943:45 - now
943:46 - okay that image is overflowing
943:48 - everywhere
943:49 - so all good now we just need to figure
943:51 - out how to control that image okay and
943:54 - uh we'll do that now by styling so
943:56 - inside of my description
943:58 - let's add padding 0 by 16 pixels
944:02 - overflow let's make it hidden
944:07 - foreign
944:10 - let's go like that
944:13 - okay let's make it a little bit darker
944:19 - cool
944:21 - all right and then we're gonna go
944:25 - and text align it to the left now you
944:29 - can't see that much right now but now
944:31 - you'll see it okay there we go so save
944:34 - boom that's where my description is
944:36 - that's what you should be seeing right
944:38 - now but really the thing we need to
944:40 - style is that image so let's control
944:42 - that so first of all let's give it a
944:44 - little bit of margin from the top
944:46 - there so now it has a little separation
944:49 - between the word text and the image
944:52 - itself let's give it a width of a
944:54 - hundred percent
944:56 - cool so again it's still crazy but we'll
945:00 - control it in a second
945:03 - let's go here let's go display block
945:08 - cool
945:10 - let's go position relative
945:14 - all right and then background color
945:21 - okay
945:25 - all right
945:26 - and then let's control the image inside
945:28 - of this tag so let's go image
945:33 - object fit contain
945:38 - so still the image should be pretty much
945:40 - out of control with 100 percent
945:44 - and finally the image is starting to
945:46 - come into control
945:53 - so let's put a semicolon here semicolon
945:55 - here
945:56 - and beautiful so now it actually looks
946:00 - like a legitimate post
946:01 - right description title info date if I
946:06 - go full screen
946:08 - I have description here so now this is
946:10 - looking like an actual post that is
946:12 - great
946:13 - that's what we want
946:16 - all right so now it's looking like an
946:18 - actual image right it looks good so
946:20 - let's keep on going with this and now
946:22 - add social counts underneath here right
946:24 - so for example how many likes does this
946:26 - image have how many upvotes does it have
946:29 - and reactions and things like that kind
946:31 - of like in the finished version I can
946:34 - see that there are 75 reactions that I
946:37 - have zero comments how many likes
946:39 - comments shares send all of that
946:42 - cool so um let's go ahead and add all of
946:47 - those things in now so what I'm going to
946:49 - do is I will go and underneath
946:52 - underneath my
946:56 - shared image component so let's go right
946:59 - underneath that
947:00 - and I'm going to add my social counts
947:04 - component okay that's what we're going
947:06 - to call it
947:08 - let's go ahead and create our list and
947:12 - then inside of it we'll make a button
947:14 - and inside of that button I'm going to
947:16 - add my image okay and uh these images
947:20 - are again we're going to give you access
947:22 - to all these images but this is
947:26 - um gonna be an image that I kind of just
947:28 - pulled
947:29 - all right it's an online it's a URL
947:32 - all right what I'm going to do is I'm
947:33 - just going to download this image so
947:35 - it's less annoying for you guys
947:37 - let's see
947:39 - um is there an easy way to actually
947:41 - download this image though
947:43 - there's no easy way to download that
947:45 - image so actually let's just use the CDN
947:48 - okay that we have here and let's just
947:51 - stick with that okay so this is the URL
947:55 - for it and again we'll add all of these
947:58 - images inside of the GitHub repo so you
948:00 - can access all of them okay so that's
948:02 - going to give you your like button
948:04 - let's add another image right underneath
948:08 - this okay and uh this is going to be the
948:12 - following URL and uh
948:16 - we'll add that one whoops let's add that
948:19 - one right there this one okay great so

948:37 - so you can see it but yeah this is the
948:39 - Clapping one okay
948:41 - so make sure you have that one
948:44 - and underneath this image I want to add
948:47 - in another thing and we'll just add span
948:49 - tag and we'll say 75. as then to say
948:52 - that we have 75 reactions so far okay
948:56 - button cool and right underneath this
949:01 - list ending let's do another one
949:05 - Li and then inside of here we're going
949:07 - to do an a tag again remove the entire
949:10 - ahref
949:12 - and uh we're gonna say one comment okay
949:15 - let's just do two comments like this
949:17 - okay and hit save
949:19 - cool
949:20 - so we got social count inside of here we
949:24 - have a list
949:25 - we have you know one button here
949:30 - now one button has
949:32 - two images and that span
949:34 - cool
949:37 - okay great
949:38 - now let's go ahead and add in The
949:42 - Styling for our social counts component
949:46 - so I'm gonna do con social counts
949:50 - styled unordered list save the error
949:53 - should go away save again go ahead
949:56 - refresh come back
949:58 - cool
949:59 - all right so now I see this
950:04 - um I see 75 reactions thumbs up clapping
950:08 - 75 claps and I see two comments right
950:11 - underneath it okay looks good but let's
950:14 - make it look better
950:18 - okay let me full screen this that's what
950:21 - it looks like right now
950:25 - okay
950:27 - so now we have to do a bunch of styling
950:30 - work to make sure that this looks good
950:32 - so let's add a line height to it about
950:35 - 1.3
950:36 - okay so that gave it a little breathing
950:38 - room for two comments let's go display
950:40 - Flex
950:42 - all right now they're pushed to the left
950:44 - hand side
950:45 - I'm gonna align items to be to start
950:48 - kind of right at the start so that's
950:50 - good I'm gonna make overflow Auto for
950:53 - this
950:56 - margin let's give it 0 by 16 pixels okay
950:59 - so now it's pushed a little bit from the
951:02 - left hand side
951:05 - padding and then give it a little bit of
951:08 - padding
951:09 - okay good so padding went ahead and
951:12 - right added more of this so now it's
951:16 - nicely centered and looks like we have
951:18 - again more breathing room there
951:20 - border let's give it a border bottom
951:24 - of one pixel solid and give it a give it
951:28 - this color here
951:31 - cool
951:32 - okay looking nice looking nice
951:36 - okay let's give it a list style and
951:39 - we'll go and give it none
951:41 - okay so those two dots that were showing
951:44 - up now are just completely gone
951:47 - and now let's actually select the list
951:49 - and style it
951:51 - so I'm gonna go margin right on this
951:53 - thing and let's go five pixels
951:55 - right
951:56 - we'll go font size 12 pixels
952:00 - cool so now the two comments are small
952:03 - button
952:04 - display Flex
952:07 - cool so it looks pretty freaking good
952:10 - now okay so that gives us our social
952:15 - that we were looking to add
952:17 - okay
952:19 - uh now what I want to do is I want to
952:21 - add social button actions inside of the
952:24 - article okay so now we're going to make
952:25 - it look even better we're going to add
952:27 - the comments button the like one and

953:01 - images so now we're good
953:04 - all right so now we got those images and
953:08 - we are gonna now start putting those
953:10 - inside okay so let's go ahead and let's
953:14 - go right under where our social accounts
953:17 - component ends so I'm going to go right
953:19 - underneath here
953:23 - and right there I'm going to add a
953:25 - button
953:26 - and inside of this button I'm going to
953:29 - add an image and this image is going to
953:32 - be my like icon dot SVG

954:49 - and where it says comments icon I'm
954:51 - going to share the remove uh replace our
954:54 - share icon and this one I'm going to
954:56 - replace it with send icon
954:58 - so now I have a share icon right here
955:02 - and a send icon right here I'm going to
955:04 - remove this word with the word share
955:07 - and I'm going to replace this word with
955:09 - the word send
955:12 - great
955:14 - that's what we have here I have a full
955:17 - screen this
955:19 - looks freaking great
955:22 - looks amazing okay
955:25 - but we still need to make it look better
955:27 - so let's go ahead and do that now so I'm
955:30 - gonna go and create a new component okay
955:33 - the one that we called social actions
955:35 - all right so let's go all the way to the
955:38 - top
955:39 - okay so right underneath
955:43 - so right underneath social accounts I'm
955:45 - going to make a new component called
955:47 - social action so I'm going to wrap all
955:48 - these buttons inside of social actions
955:51 - okay so let's go ahead and do that so
955:53 - I'll go social
955:55 - um let's do it like this social actions
955:59 - let's copy that and let's go right
956:02 - outside of this and paste it
956:04 - so all the stuff that we added let's put
956:07 - it inside of social actions like so
956:12 - okay now it's gonna complain hey I don't
956:14 - know but this thing is all good
956:18 - let's go and do
956:20 - and uh and describe the style component
956:23 - so we'll do con social actions is equal
956:26 - to
956:28 - and I want to do styled div
956:31 - a
956:33 - okay refresh here we go
956:37 - they're right there
956:41 - okay and now let's go ahead and do the
956:44 - following
956:46 - let's go align items
956:48 - and I'm gonna align them centrally cool
956:52 - display Flex because I like enabling
956:55 - Flex mode on here
957:00 - right
957:02 - I'm gonna give it a margin of zero
957:06 - Min height
957:09 - of 40 pixels
957:13 - there we go
957:16 - let's give it a little padding for by
957:20 - eight pixels like that
957:23 - and then I'm going to make a button
957:26 - appear on this or style button not make
957:28 - a button appear on this what the heck am
957:30 - I talking about
957:32 - and let's do inline Flex on this thing
957:36 - great
957:37 - let's align these items centrally
957:41 - cool
957:43 - padding let's go eight pixels
957:46 - looking great
957:51 - okay give it a little blue so now they
957:54 - actually look very clickable
957:59 - and then um I want to add a media query
958:02 - but only 2D buttons okay nothing else
958:06 - so I'm going to do the following
958:09 - let's add our media query and I'm going
958:11 - to say Min with
958:14 - so this is going to be the other way
958:16 - this is going to say only do this on
958:18 - desktop mode so you're not going to see
958:19 - anything change right now
958:22 - okay this is saying
958:25 - only on desktop only on something bigger
958:27 - than a mobile device that's what that
958:29 - means it's the inverse of Max width
958:31 - and I'm going to say give it a margin
958:33 - left of 8 pixels
958:36 - okay you're not going to see a
958:37 - difference but let's go full screen here
958:41 - all right and so you see the like icon
958:44 - and you see the distance between the
958:46 - like emoji and the and the like text
958:49 - all right
958:51 - now on the actual mobile device they're
958:54 - much closer together okay if I actually
958:57 - comment this line out and we full screen
959:01 - it notice that they're much closer
959:02 - together okay so that difference only
959:05 - takes place on a desktop
959:09 - great so so far so good you should be up
959:13 - to Here and Now our posts are starting
959:15 - to take shape and we are liking it
959:19 - all right you dirty boys and girls let's
959:21 - keep rocking and rolling so we're having
959:23 - fun so far having fun so far you're
959:26 - enjoying yourself but now we're gonna do
959:28 - redones and that's gonna slap you in the
959:31 - face fun time is over get ready to get
959:34 - spanked actually you might like Redux
959:36 - okay so hang in there and enjoy it with
959:38 - me come on let's go so let's get to the
959:40 - Redux part okay so first things first we
959:43 - gotta install Redux how do we do that
959:45 - command J open the command line
959:48 - okay and um what I'm gonna do is just
959:51 - for a second I'm gonna stop my server by
959:53 - doing control C okay
959:56 - um on Windows it might be something else
959:58 - but just control C should work all right
960:00 - and I will simply do
960:03 - yarn add you can do npm install
960:06 - okay it's the same thing yarn add
960:10 - and I'm gonna do react Redux like so and
960:13 - I'm going to hit enter and so now it's
960:16 - going to install react Redux and then
960:18 - I'm gonna also install just Redux by
960:21 - itself yarn add and we're going to do
960:23 - Redux like so so go ahead and install
960:25 - both of those beautiful packages my
960:27 - beautiful person
960:29 - okay great
960:31 - now that that's done we're gonna go
960:33 - ahead and wrap the entire app in a Redux
960:35 - store so let's go to index.js
960:38 - okay and um simply go at the top and
960:43 - right underneath here we're going to do
960:44 - the following I'm going to import
960:46 - provider
960:48 - prover
960:50 - provider
960:52 - from
960:53 - react Redux
960:56 - cool
960:57 - and then the next thing I'm going to do
960:58 - is I'm going to import store
961:00 - from
961:02 - store
961:07 - okay
961:10 - um yeah so we have to still of course
961:12 - create a store which we're gonna do soon
961:14 - all right so don't freak out but we're
961:18 - gonna be creating a store soon
961:20 - okay
961:21 - but yeah this is what all I want you to
961:24 - add for now and then let's go underneath
961:27 - and what I'm gonna do is a few things
961:30 - instead of
961:32 - right underneath so this app here right
961:34 - we want to wrap this app inside of our
961:37 - provider now okay so let's go provider
961:41 - and store and we're going to give it our
961:44 - store that we have
961:48 - okay and uh wrap the app inside of that
961:52 - provider
961:54 - that's all
961:56 - cool that's all
961:58 - cool if you try to run your app right
962:00 - now and you're running into an error
962:02 - don't worry it's because we haven't made
962:03 - the store file yet okay so we're gonna
962:05 - go ahead and make that store file
962:08 - so let's go ahead and do that all right
962:11 - so uh let's go to
962:14 - our reducers and let's make the reducers
962:16 - first okay so I'm gonna go ahead and
962:20 - make a reducer
962:23 - let's do it like this so in my source
962:26 - I'm going to create a new folder and
962:28 - it's going to be called reducers
962:30 - okay and inside of reducers what I'm
962:33 - going to do is I'm going to make
962:35 - index.js
962:38 - okay great and um
962:42 - what all I'm going to do here is I'm
962:43 - going to say import combine
962:47 - reducers
962:49 - okay and we're going to import that from
962:51 - Redux
962:53 - and let's also do import user reducer
962:56 - from
962:58 - whoops
963:00 - user reducer like this
963:04 - and I'm going to say make root reducer
963:07 - equal to combined reducers
963:11 - that's a cool thing about some of the
963:12 - Redux stuff that we're doing okay
963:15 - and we're going to say user reducer like
963:19 - that
963:20 - okay so this is going to allow us to
963:22 - combine the reducer so it's going to be
963:24 - helpful now let's make another file
963:26 - inside of our reducers folder and this
963:29 - is going to be called user reducer
963:33 - like this
963:36 - okay so let's go inside of our user
963:38 - reducer and we're gonna do we're gonna
963:40 - initialize the initial state in here and
963:43 - uh we'll simply make the initial state
963:45 - to be where user is null he's empty or
963:49 - she
963:50 - okay and then we're gonna say user
963:52 - reducer is going to be whatever
963:55 - um in this case the initial state
963:59 - so the by default if you don't pass in
964:01 - anything it's just going to be the
964:03 - initial State and it's also going to
964:05 - take in an action
964:07 - and we're going to do a switch
964:11 - depending on the action type uh default
964:15 - however will be just the thing that
964:18 - Returns the state okay so if I get so
964:22 - here's how this reducer I think about it
964:24 - right
964:25 - user reducer anytime there's a reducer
964:29 - how I think about it really it should be
964:31 - called in my mind
964:33 - a state updater
964:36 - because all a reducer does is it updates
964:39 - a given state so for example if we gave
964:42 - it some type of state it would update it
964:44 - okay otherwise it would just return the
964:47 - existing state so here's just a dumb
964:49 - example if I gave it an array
964:52 - um with an action of
964:55 - um you know if I gave it something with
964:56 - the action of like it'll send a payload
965:00 - and it will hit like here and it will
965:04 - increment it by one
965:07 - okay
965:09 - that's where the switch case will come
965:10 - in okay is the switch case like
965:12 - all right then do the following action
965:14 - where we increment like by one is the
965:17 - switch action type comment uh well then
965:20 - in that case in increment the comment
965:22 - section by one
965:24 - if it's none of those well the default
965:27 - should be hey just return the actual
965:29 - State don't really do anything
965:30 - okay so that's kind of what's happening
965:32 - at a high level
965:34 - all right so now we have both of these
965:36 - made now let's go ahead and of course
965:38 - create our store okay and uh we are
965:42 - going to add our store
965:45 - um
965:47 - we're going to add our store let me
965:49 - actually just see this real quick all
965:51 - right so let's go inside of our
965:53 - um source and in our source we're gonna
965:57 - create a new folder okay and we're just
965:59 - going to call that folder store
966:02 - okay and inside of store I'm going to
966:05 - create a new file and this will be
966:07 - called index.js
966:10 - within this file we're going to do a
966:11 - couple of things we're going to create
966:13 - store and we're going to apply some
966:16 - middleware
966:17 - [Music]
966:18 - uh did I write it correctly and then
966:21 - remove it yes knowing me
966:23 - probably did something silly like that
966:25 - apply middleware and of course
966:28 - let's bring it from Redux
966:35 - okay import root reducer from
966:40 - reducers okay and now let's just Define
966:44 - our store and once we do this we're not
966:47 - going to have errors anymore in our app
966:49 - and our app should start
966:51 - uh running
966:58 - [Music]
967:00 - okay great so now store is defined we
967:04 - are also exporting store now that we're
967:07 - exporting store we will have access to
967:10 - it inside of our project
967:12 - and in our index.js if I go here
967:16 - we are importing that store
967:19 - and then we're passing it to our
967:21 - provider
967:22 - so technically looking at this we should
967:25 - not have any more errors if you do npm
967:27 - start in my case I'm going to do yarn
967:29 - start
967:31 - you should not have um
967:34 - errors on this thing okay so let me
967:35 - refresh
967:38 - okay so it's saying does not contain a
967:41 - default export
967:43 - and what does not contain a default
967:45 - export
967:46 - it is complaining about
967:50 - what is it complaining about attempted
967:52 - import error
967:54 - dot dot slash reducer does not contain a
967:57 - default export cool so let's go to some
968:00 - of our reducer files and let's see if
968:02 - we're exporting what we want to be
968:03 - exporting
968:05 - ah looks like we're not okay so in our
968:08 - user reducer we're gonna just simply do
968:10 - export default
968:13 - thank you
968:15 - and I'm going to say user reducer
968:18 - or wait am I in user user right now no
968:20 - I'm not
968:21 - I'm an index.js so here we have root
968:24 - reducer so I need to be
968:27 - yeah that would make sense
968:29 - so let's export the root reducer and
968:32 - let's go into our user reducer
968:35 - and let's go and Export default user
968:38 - reducer
968:40 - now we should be
968:42 - uh getting both of those
968:46 - did I misspell int yes I did initial
968:49 - should not be spelled in tissue should
968:51 - be spelled initial so initial is now
968:53 - defined
968:55 - cool now
968:58 - that was just set up okay of Redux and
969:01 - uh there's a pretty good start to it and
969:03 - we're making good progress let's keep
969:05 - going
969:06 - all right guys so just a little note
969:08 - this that you're gonna build is gonna be
969:10 - an example without using Redux toolkit
969:13 - so we wanted to show you what life looks
969:16 - like without toolkit Redux is much
969:18 - harder with that Redux toolkit if you
969:20 - built our Disney plus clone you would
969:23 - have noticed things were much simpler
969:24 - with Redux toolkit it's going to be a
969:26 - little bit harder but I think it's
969:28 - important for you to know this because
969:30 - you might go to a company that's not
969:31 - using the Redux toolkit yet
969:33 - so let's go
969:35 - all right so let's go and now start
969:39 - working on the log in functionality okay
969:42 - so I'm gonna go ahead to my login
969:45 - component do we have one yet actually we
969:48 - don't so let's go ahead and start
969:50 - working on that component now okay so
969:54 - inside of our components oh we do we do
969:56 - my bad cool so inside of our login
969:59 - component we're gonna do a couple of
970:01 - things
970:03 - okay let's go all the way at the end
970:05 - where we're exporting default login
970:08 - um we're not going to need that okay so
970:12 - let's remove that for now
970:14 - actually just leave that for now so we
970:16 - don't have an error but we'll delete
970:17 - that later okay and at the top what I'm
970:20 - gonna do is let's go import connect
970:26 - from
970:28 - react Redux like so
970:32 - okay and uh let's keep going down
970:38 - and what we're going to do here is now
970:41 - we're going to create a map state to
970:44 - props okay that's another one of the
970:46 - annoying things that we had to do before
970:49 - we got Redux toolkit okay but I'll show
970:52 - you how this works as well
970:58 - boom we'll leave that as empty and then
971:02 - we'll also do map dispatch
971:04 - to props
971:08 - okay
971:10 - and then let's
971:11 - go ahead and do this
971:15 - cool okay again just hang in with me
971:19 - I promise the more you do repetition of
971:22 - building things with Redux some more is
971:24 - going to start to make sense but it's
971:25 - kind of like one of those things that
971:27 - you kind of get the AHA moments all at
971:29 - once and also pattern recognition is key
971:31 - key key to understanding these things
971:33 - okay so don't get discouraged the first
971:36 - time you see this because it's gonna
971:37 - freak you out
971:39 - now let's go export default and I'm
971:42 - gonna
971:43 - do export default connect and we're
971:46 - going to do map state
971:47 - to props and I'm going to do map
971:50 - dispatch to props
971:53 - to props like that
971:55 - okay and then I'm also going to do login
971:57 - like this okay so freaking weird right
972:00 - but there we go
972:02 - okay that is gonna allow us to export
972:06 - login as well
972:09 - cool okay so we're good so far now what
972:13 - we need to do is we actually need to
972:14 - start installing a couple of things all
972:17 - right now let's go ahead and start
972:18 - installing a couple of other things
972:19 - we're going to need so we're going to
972:21 - need Redux thunk and we're gonna need a
972:24 - Firebase okay so let's go ahead and
972:26 - install these things now so I'm going to
972:28 - hit I'm going to click on my command
972:29 - line I'm going to hit Ctrl C to stop the
972:32 - server
972:33 - now hit enter just a couple of times and
972:35 - then I'm just going to do yarn add again
972:37 - you can do npm install but I'm just
972:40 - going to do yarn add and I'll do
972:42 - Firebase like so so now start installing
972:46 - Firebase and once that's done we're
972:49 - going to install something else
972:51 - okay we're gonna install Firebase tools
972:53 - because you're going to need those
972:56 - so I'm going to do yarn add Firebase
972:58 - tools that's the second thing you're
973:01 - going to need to install
973:03 - and then after that we're going to need
973:05 - one more thing to install
973:13 - all right now and then last one we're
973:15 - going to need is yarn add and I'm going
973:17 - to do Redux thunk Redux Dash thunk okay
973:22 - so we're gonna make sure that we have
973:24 - that
973:26 - so those are the three things we're
973:28 - gonna install make sure you don't miss
973:30 - on any of these because these are going
973:31 - to be important
973:33 - okay
973:34 - and then of course we're gonna need
973:35 - access to our Firebase config files so
973:38 - let's go ahead and get them now all
973:41 - right now so here's what I want you to
973:42 - do go to Firebase
973:44 - okay firebase.com so let's just go
973:47 - together firebase.com like so hit
973:51 - um here I'm just gonna go to the email
973:53 - that I prefer and then hit go to console
973:57 - okay and here you're gonna see all these
974:00 - clones uh free I mean you might not see
974:03 - any of them this is my Firebase so for
974:05 - you you might have to do add project
974:07 - okay and you might want to do LinkedIn
974:10 - clone I'm just gonna call It Dummy clone
974:12 - but you should call it LinkedIn clone
974:14 - like this okay so dummy
974:16 - Linked In clone like so hit continue
974:22 - um you don't need anything else and then
974:24 - they'll say creating your project and
974:26 - that's good
974:27 - okay that's kind of what you want
974:31 - and I'll show you what you need to do
974:33 - after that
974:35 - looks so beautiful right look at that UI
974:38 - beautiful just circling around all right
974:41 - so let's hit continue on that thing and
974:45 - then let's keep on rocking and rolling
974:49 - um okay so I already have a project
974:52 - created so I'm gonna get out of this one
974:54 - now and I'm gonna go to the other
974:56 - project that I have okay so I'm gonna
974:58 - switch to my LinkedIn clone you just
975:00 - stay in that exact one okay
975:02 - and here I'm gonna pull go to Project
975:06 - settings
975:08 - okay and we're gonna get the things that
975:11 - we need here so go all the way to
975:13 - Firebase SDK snippet click config and
975:16 - then get all of the details for your app
975:19 - that you need okay so I'm just gonna
975:20 - copy all of these details copy
975:23 - let's go back to our app
975:26 - okay and let's start working on our app
975:29 - so
975:30 - what I'm going to do now
975:33 - all right and just in case you were not
975:35 - able to find this code right let's kind
975:37 - of walk through it together so I'm gonna
975:40 - switch to my clone the the dummy one
975:43 - that I was building alongside with you
975:45 - okay and now it might say there are no
975:47 - apps in your project so what I want you
975:48 - to do is click that code button right
975:50 - here
975:51 - go ahead and do that now and now inside
975:54 - of here just call it the same thing we
975:57 - could call it LinkedIn Dash clone
976:01 - okay and then just hit Register App for
976:04 - now
976:07 - okay and now it's gonna give you all of
976:11 - the code that you need
976:13 - okay so then just simply grab
976:17 - grab don't grab the script tags but you
976:21 - can just grab everything that's inside
976:22 - of that like VAR okay and just copy it
976:26 - cool great so that's all you need to do
976:30 - on your end all right I'm going to
976:32 - switch back to my other project that I
976:34 - had made and I'm gonna grab everything
976:37 - from there
976:42 - all right now what I want you to do is
976:45 - go ahead inside of your source and right
976:49 - click on your Source folder and make a
976:52 - new file and I'm going to call it
976:55 - firebase.js okay and inside of here I
976:59 - want you to do import Firebase from
977:02 - Firebase like that
977:05 - and then just go ahead and paste your
977:07 - config
977:08 - okay and in your config you should have
977:11 - the API key
977:13 - you should have the auth domain project
977:15 - ID storage bucket messaging sender ID
977:19 - app ID and measurement ID okay and it
977:22 - should be called const Firebase config
977:24 - like that
977:25 - cool now I'm going to just do a couple
977:27 - of things after this so Firebase app
977:31 - and I'm going to initialize this app
977:35 - like this and pass in the Firebase
977:37 - config
977:38 - cool that'll help initialize your app
977:41 - now let's connect your Firebase to your
977:44 - database so let's do Firebase
977:46 - app.firestore
977:50 - okay
977:51 - and let's do const auth
977:55 - actually you know what I'll build mine
977:58 - from scratch with you guys okay so let's
978:00 - let's go to my
978:02 - dummy version here okay
978:06 - and I'll just build this out with you
978:08 - guys because I think that's going to be
978:10 - the best way for you guys to pick this
978:13 - up so let's hit save
978:15 - cool now you and I are gonna be on the
978:17 - same page okay
978:19 - I don't have any unfair Advantage Okay
978:22 - so
978:24 - firestore cons OS
978:28 - um
978:28 - okay this is what we're gonna need this
978:30 - for authentication later
978:33 - let's add that
978:34 - provider
978:37 - newfirebase dot auth dot Google auth
978:41 - provider
978:44 - okay
978:45 - and then let's do storage
978:51 - firebase.storage
978:53 - okay because we need to store our images
978:54 - somewhere all right so that's what we're
978:56 - going to be using storage for and now
978:58 - let's export some of these things so we
979:00 - have access to them outside of here okay
979:06 - and then export default database because
979:08 - we're going to need access to the
979:09 - database as well so this is what your
979:11 - overall Firebase file should be looking
979:13 - like this is going to be very important
979:14 - for all your Firebase uh stuff so make
979:17 - sure that you don't have some funny
979:19 - weird stuff going on here okay
979:22 - all right now let's go inside of our
979:25 - index.js which is inside of our store
979:27 - okay so we have bunch of index.jss now
979:30 - but go inside of your store click on
979:32 - that index.js okay and uh here's the
979:37 - here's what we're gonna do okay now
979:38 - we're gonna add
979:40 - a couple of things to our store
979:44 - okay
979:45 - so
979:47 - let's Hey where's my
979:51 - okay that line was just too far away for
979:53 - me to see
979:54 - let's do import thunk middleware
979:58 - okay from Redux thunk
980:02 - and um
980:04 - also what we're gonna do is now we're
980:06 - gonna start applying the middleware so
980:08 - I'm going to remove this I'm going to
980:10 - say apply middleware
980:13 - and I'm going to pass in sunk
980:16 - middleware like so
980:19 - and we're just going to close that
980:21 - paren
980:22 - and that's it okay that's the change
980:25 - that we're making here
980:27 - so we should be
980:29 - we should be good for now and now what
980:32 - we want to do is like continue adding in
980:34 - the login functionality okay so we're
980:36 - going to now add a couple of more things
980:39 - to our login okay beautiful you're
980:41 - freaking crushing it let's keep on going
980:44 - so we got this now let's make the login
980:48 - functionality work okay and what do I
980:50 - mean by that here's what I mean by that
980:52 - let's if we go to our finalized LinkedIn
980:55 - clone app if I sign out here look what
980:57 - happens if I hit sign in with Google
981:01 - boom right so this pop-up how is it
981:04 - happening how's that information being
981:06 - stored we're gonna do that and resolve
981:08 - that with Redux okay and Firebase
981:13 - so let's go ahead and work on that
981:15 - functionality now so first things first
981:19 - which one should I work on first let me
981:21 - think
981:25 - okay let's go to Let's actually do this
981:28 - okay so in our source let's make a new
981:31 - folder and we're going to call it
981:33 - actions okay for Redux you have your
981:35 - actions you have your reducers you need
981:38 - all these things okay
981:40 - and uh it's good to put them in
981:42 - different folders so inside of this
981:44 - actions we're going to create a index.js
981:49 - cool
981:50 - and uh in here we're going to import a
981:53 - couple of things I'm going to import
981:54 - auth and I'm going to import provider
981:56 - and
981:58 - um we're gonna get this from Firebase
982:01 - okay and then let's do export function
982:05 - because we're going to need to export
982:07 - this anyway so let's go sign in
982:10 - API that's what it's going to be called
982:13 - and what it's going to do is going to
982:15 - dispatch
982:17 - [Music]
982:18 - um
982:19 - auth okay and we're going to do sign in
982:22 - with pop-up so this is a nice function
982:25 - that comes with Firebase okay so this
982:27 - auth right here is coming from Firebase
982:30 - so sign in with pop-up like that
982:37 - okay so sign in with pop-up once
982:40 - Firebase responds with the promise we're
982:43 - going to do dot then okay so we're gonna
982:45 - chain it
982:47 - and we're gonna pass it a payload
982:53 - payload like so
982:57 - oops
982:58 - boom
983:00 - and then inside here I'm just gonna
983:02 - console log the payload okay so we're
983:04 - gonna be able to see that
983:06 - great now let's go here and I'm gonna do
983:11 - dot catch and let's catch any errors
983:14 - that we're getting
983:15 - and then I'm just simply going to alert
983:18 - us
983:19 - of the error message
983:21 - okay so this is what your index.js file
983:26 - should look like right about now
983:28 - okay and now let's go ahead and put it
983:30 - to use all right so now let's go to our
983:33 - login component where we're actually
983:34 - going to use this sign in thing okay so
983:39 - login
983:41 - dot JS and uh
983:43 - let's start with importing
983:47 - that little method that we made sign in
983:49 - API
983:51 - if from
983:56 - that okay so that'll import it and now
984:00 - what we're going to do is inside a form
984:01 - where we had Google form now all we're
984:04 - going to do to this component and we're
984:05 - going to say hey on click we want you to
984:08 - do something
984:10 - here's what we want you to do
984:12 - we want you to run that function so
984:15 - we're just going to do props.sign in
984:17 - okay
984:20 - that's it
984:21 - okay so let's go ahead and do this
984:25 - okay
984:27 - and we're gonna go down and this is
984:29 - where Redux gets funky but just hang in
984:31 - there with me okay and I'll show you how
984:33 - we do this so all the way at the end
984:35 - right here for the Redux portion we're
984:37 - gonna add this
984:39 - kind of right below our export default
984:41 - and let's go ahead and do map dispatch
984:44 - to props
984:47 - [Music]
984:49 - actually we're doing that already so
984:51 - let's just stay in here boom right there
984:54 - okay
984:56 - dispatch and this is the code so let's
984:59 - hit enter and get inside of here and
985:02 - we're going to say sign in
985:04 - okay and what that's going to do is
985:06 - that's going to dispatch our method sign
985:09 - in API
985:14 - okay so this sign in here
985:18 - right corresponds to
985:21 - where we're doing props.signin okay so
985:24 - now those things are connected
985:26 - and again think of Redux Like This
985:28 - Global store
985:30 - okay where when the user logs in it
985:34 - passes the user login information and
985:36 - stores it there on the front end it's
985:37 - kind of like having a database on the
985:39 - front end that you can access really
985:41 - really fast that's how I think about
985:42 - Redux and State Management tools
985:48 - all right awesome so now we got all of
985:50 - this that's looking good now let's
985:52 - actually start dispatching these actions
985:55 - um to the stores after integrating it
985:58 - with Google auth so we're going to start
985:59 - adding the Google Google auth into uh
986:03 - integration very very soon okay so first
986:07 - of all here's what I want to do let me
986:08 - go to my Firebase okay and uh what I'm
986:12 - going to do to my Firebase is let's go
986:13 - to authentication inside of my Firebase
986:17 - and under my authentication so let's go
986:20 - to our Firebase app and then inside of
986:23 - our app what we're going to do is uh
986:25 - let's go ahead to our authentication and
986:28 - then just go and click get started
986:33 - cool now inside of get started what
986:35 - we're going to do is hit where it says
986:38 - Google
986:39 - for provider and just hit enable
986:42 - and that's essentially it okay just give
986:44 - it your email whatever your email
986:48 - wait give me a weird email but whatever
986:50 - that should be good
986:52 - okay so now your Google should be
986:55 - enabled another weird uh thing uh by the
986:58 - way is if you are on some type of
987:01 - different Firebase
987:02 - website
987:04 - there you might have uh you might not
987:07 - see what I see here you might see
987:09 - something completely different so what
987:11 - you want to do in that case is actually
987:13 - you want to hit where it says build okay
987:16 - for some of you might say build click
987:19 - that and then click authentication
987:21 - underneath that that'll bring you to
987:24 - your authentication okay
987:26 - okay so now let's go ahead and start
987:28 - trying things and trying to break
987:30 - through things and let's see what
987:31 - happens okay so I'm gonna go to my
987:33 - actual app and on my app instead of home
987:37 - let's delete that and let's just go to
987:39 - the you know localhost 3000 now it's
987:43 - might say the site can't be reached well
987:45 - no problem I'm just gonna hit yarn start
987:47 - you can in your terminal hit npm start
987:50 - and you should be good to go
987:53 - okay
987:56 - so now uh we're gonna click uh oh my
988:00 - middleware is not defined oh okay
988:02 - interesting so let's go to my store my
988:07 - index.js inside of my store okay and in
988:10 - here
988:11 - I'm probably capitalizing it somewhere
988:14 - middleware and let's make it lowercase
988:17 - okay all right there we go
988:20 - all right I'm sorry Frankie Frankie's
988:22 - building it out with me to help test it
988:24 - by the way shout out to Frankie guys
988:26 - Frankie's been here Frankie popping
988:29 - Frankie's been here and Tess running and
988:32 - doing the entire build actually with us
988:34 - so he can make sure that this is
988:36 - actually running perfectly for you guys
988:39 - okay so drop some love for Frankie in
988:41 - the comments below cool let's keep going
988:44 - now let's hit sign in with Google and
988:47 - Frankie says it's working for him
988:49 - oh
988:51 - it's working
988:53 - that's cool right
988:55 - that's so freaking cool let's set
988:56 - content cleverprogrammer.com
989:00 - nice okay great so let's open up inspect
989:06 - and let's see if the payload is inside
989:09 - of our console and it looks like it is
989:13 - okay so hit inspect
989:16 - go to console and do you see where it
989:19 - says object
989:21 - now click the drop down on the object so
989:23 - you guys should see user right here
989:26 - Okay now click under user did you uh did
989:28 - you click the drop down
989:30 - now keep scrolling down and you'll
989:32 - actually see display name
989:34 - you'll see email and you'll see email
989:36 - verified
989:37 - yeah okay great and if you keep
989:41 - scrolling down you'll actually even see
989:43 - things like Photo URL do you see that
989:45 - now if you double click into the photo
989:47 - URL
989:50 - um actually can I select that copies so
989:53 - right click and copy string
989:57 - okay and now open a new tab and paste
990:00 - that string
990:02 - you should see your photo
990:04 - like this
990:09 - okay
990:11 - and that should tell you
990:13 - that your um your app is like actually
990:17 - pulling the payload from the sign in
990:20 - right so like where is that payload
990:22 - statement let's just go ahead and search
990:24 - let's go console there's like only one
990:27 - place we're actually doing console log
990:30 - um and it's inside of our uh
990:33 - oops not mean to do that
990:35 - we're doing this inside of our user
990:39 - reducer it seems like
990:43 - no no I'm sorry why am I I'm being
990:45 - freaking crazy we're it's what's right
990:47 - here not inside of our user user we're
990:49 - using it inside of our actions index.js
990:51 - and we're console logging so the payload
990:55 - is actually what Firebase gives us back
990:58 - it's this object that's the payload that
991:02 - gets dropped uh every time we log in so
991:05 - we'll be able to use that payload to
991:06 - pull the photo and pull the name and
991:08 - email and all of that good stuff okay so
991:10 - granted we're able to get everything
991:14 - that we need right granted we're able to
991:16 - get everything that we're looking for we
991:18 - still need a way to actually store that
991:22 - information right we still need a way to
991:24 - store that information so that's what
991:25 - we're gonna do and web the website and
991:28 - things still need to change uh based on
991:32 - the user logging in okay because it
991:34 - shouldn't keep saying sign in with
991:35 - Google the whole time that would not
991:37 - make sense
991:38 - all right so let's go ahead and start
991:41 - setting things up so first thing I'm
991:43 - going to do is inside of actions
991:46 - I'm going to make a new file and this
991:50 - file is going to be called action
991:52 - type.js
991:54 - okay and I'm going to do something very
991:57 - simple I'm just going to say export
991:58 - const set user equals set user
992:06 - okay that's all set user equals string
992:10 - set user that's it
992:13 - all right now let's go inside of let's
992:17 - see which file should I work on first
992:20 - let's go ahead inside of our user
992:22 - reducer now
992:26 - okay that's inside of our reducer so for
992:29 - example just click reducer then go to
992:31 - user reducer you should be there now
992:33 - we're gonna do a couple of things here
992:36 - inside of our switch case so depending
992:39 - on what type of action we get so if we
992:42 - get a case where
992:43 - we're setting a user
992:46 - what we're going to do is we're going to
992:47 - return
992:49 - whatever the state was previously
992:52 - and then add in our new user okay so the
992:56 - state is going to be updated just by one
992:58 - thing
992:59 - now it's complaining hey use uh set user
993:02 - is not defined well no worries let's go
993:04 - all the way at the top and let's import
993:06 - it so import
993:08 - set user
993:12 - okay from
993:14 - foreign
993:15 - [Music]
993:20 - type
993:22 - like that
993:24 - cool so now it won't be giving us an
993:27 - error anymore our app should actually be
993:29 - working so we're good with the user
993:31 - reducer for now now let's go inside of
993:34 - our index.js all right and now let's go
993:36 - to our index.js
993:39 - okay and in our index.js all I'm going
993:42 - to do and sorry wrong index.js my bad
993:45 - let's go inside of our actions index.js
993:47 - right here and now all I want to do
993:49 - inside of my payload instead of using
993:52 - console.log we're going to dispatch the
993:55 - user dispatch means
993:57 - send that information out shoot it okay
994:00 - whenever I think dispatch I think of
994:02 - like the Olympics um
994:06 - um what is it called referee shooting
994:08 - gun
994:10 - right so it's like
994:11 - whenever the starting pistol
994:14 - no not that that's like two of crazy
994:16 - starting pistol
994:18 - okay
994:19 - holy crap this just got crazy
994:22 - uh Sprint
994:25 - Jesus that's what I think of
994:27 - whenever I think of dispatching actions
994:29 - so like whenever we dispatch actions
994:31 - from the stores like like tell the
994:33 - entire store we're where um the user has
994:37 - logged in okay
994:40 - man got crazy
994:42 - so this is who you are when you're
994:45 - dispatching actions
994:47 - is this an actual gun I don't know if
994:50 - they have they don't have real guns
994:52 - right at the Olympics
994:55 - okay so let's go inside so in our
994:57 - index.js
994:59 - here now let's just make a couple of
995:00 - changes
995:01 - okay first of all we're gonna import
995:04 - from the top
995:06 - import set user like so and I'm going to
995:11 - do from action type okay
995:15 - that's good
995:17 - now let's also export
995:21 - cons set user
995:25 - this is going to help us set the user
995:26 - and it's going to take in a payload
995:30 - whoops
995:32 - it's going to take in a payload and
995:34 - that's going to be type
995:37 - set user and then the user is gonna be
995:41 - the payload okay whatever the payload is
995:44 - gonna be
995:45 - cool
995:48 - all right so that's good
995:52 - import is looking fresh and now we're
995:55 - just gonna dispatch the action here
995:57 - instead of console logging it's a
995:59 - dispatch set
996:01 - user and payload user just like so
996:07 - okay
996:08 - save
996:11 - okay so now with all three of those
996:14 - things done
996:15 - hopefully that information is actually
996:17 - being stored inside of Redux let's hit
996:20 - sign in with Google
996:22 - and I'm gonna go ahead and sign in
996:25 - cool
996:26 - so we'll be able to see later if this
996:28 - information is actually being stored or
996:30 - not all right so now let's redirect our
996:32 - user to home page on login so I'm going
996:34 - to go to login and inside of my
996:37 - container right at the beginning here's
996:40 - what I'm gonna do
996:41 - I'm gonna say the following I'm gonna
996:45 - say
996:46 - hey if we got a user going on
996:49 - okay
996:50 - then what I want you to do is I want you
996:53 - to redirect
996:54 - to
996:55 - okay and what we'll do is uh let me
996:58 - write redirect and hit enter so I'll
997:00 - import it from react router okay
997:03 - importing that from react router just
997:06 - like that cool and what I will say is
997:09 - redirect me to the home page
997:13 - cool now let's end that bad boy like
997:17 - that beautiful beautiful beautiful
997:19 - beautiful beautiful beautiful
997:20 - very very clean line and it says hey if
997:24 - the user is there redirect me now all we
997:26 - need to do to make this magic work is
997:30 - let's go all the way to the bottom
997:33 - and um what I'm gonna do is right above
997:36 - map dispatch to props
997:39 - let's just add it here
997:42 - actually inside of map state to props we
997:44 - can do this okay
997:46 - we can do this right here so where it
997:47 - says return which is empty we're going
997:49 - to say
997:50 - user state to state dot userstate dot
997:55 - user
997:56 - so that's who the user is going to be
997:59 - and look at that it is already
998:02 - redirecting us how freaking cool is that
998:06 - you fools
998:07 - if I go to home page
998:12 - okay let's hit sign in with Google
998:14 - hopefully it works let's see hopefully
998:16 - it breaks
998:18 - and breaks my heart whoa
998:22 - whoa
998:24 - smash the like button if you enjoyed
998:26 - that one that was really clean
998:28 - okay
998:29 - I'm loving this man are you guys loving
998:31 - this I hope you're loving this okay this
998:34 - is awesome all right now Redux is kind
998:37 - of crazy so before we move on I just
998:38 - want to explain some of this stuff here
998:40 - okay so let's go back to our home page
998:42 - or not our homepage but our login page
998:44 - right
998:45 - this sign-in pop-up this just this one
998:48 - line of code makes that pop-up happen
998:51 - that is insane okay so that's just that
998:54 - one line of code that's making that
998:56 - pop-up happen
998:57 - then this line of code is telling the
999:00 - app
999:01 - hey this is the user information
999:05 - so I'm dispatching this action
999:07 - when I dispatch this action I sended
999:09 - this function called set user okay and I
999:11 - give it the payload of the user so
999:13 - remember what is payload.user do you
999:17 - guys remember that when I did um let's
999:19 - actually do this right now so I'm going
999:21 - to console log console log and I'm just
999:24 - going to do payload here okay and what
999:26 - I'm going to do here is comment this
999:27 - line out and let's hit refresh now I'm
999:29 - going to hit sign in with Google and
999:31 - let's hit inspect okay on the right hand
999:33 - side and I'm gonna go to whoops not
999:35 - sources console okay and I'm gonna click
999:39 - sign in right there now an object just
999:43 - appeared okay and it's giving me this
999:45 - information about the user okay now the
999:49 - user information is the one I want right
999:52 - so now watch this now I'm gonna do
999:54 - payload dot what
999:57 - user
999:58 - right so now watch what happens if I hit
1000:01 - save and I hit uh refresh okay and let's
1000:05 - go sign in with Google and I'm gonna hit
1000:06 - Causey cleverprogrammer.com
1000:08 - I'm just gonna get the information
1000:10 - pertaining to the user that's it
1000:14 - so
1000:15 - I'm not meeting my display name and I'm
1000:18 - getting my email and I'm getting all of
1000:19 - that right so that's what payload.user
1000:22 - actually is so that object we're sending
1000:27 - over to this method over here that's a
1000:30 - set user so set user takes a payload the
1000:32 - payload was all of the user details
1000:35 - now this is typeset user and
1000:39 - user we set it to whatever the payload
1000:41 - was
1000:42 - okay that's kind of what's Happening
1000:45 - um that's kind of what's Happening Here
1000:47 - okay and let's go to set user
1000:50 - boom okay this is
1000:53 - it's all freaking connected okay now if
1000:56 - I go inside of my reducers and I go
1000:58 - inside of my user reducers
1001:00 - when it sees the case that I'm trying to
1001:03 - set the user it takes my existing state
1001:05 - and it just adds the new user to it and
1001:09 - if the state doesn't change it just
1001:11 - Returns the default state of whatever it
1001:13 - was before that user was there that's it
1001:16 - okay and remember Redux is immutable so
1001:20 - I'm not mutating this okay I'm creating
1001:22 - a brand new state with whatever the
1001:25 - previous state was along with the new
1001:28 - one user that I've added okay so a
1001:31 - little bit of just explaining behind the
1001:33 - scenes of what's happening with Redux
1001:35 - so now what we're going to do is we're
1001:37 - going to take the user authentication
1001:40 - info when the authentication is changed
1001:44 - okay and store it okay so for example
1001:46 - when I log in I want to like store that
1001:48 - information and have access to it okay
1001:51 - anytime I'm like refreshing or getting
1001:53 - that information so let's go ahead and
1001:55 - work on that now so inside of my actions
1001:58 - and index.js what I will do underneath
1002:02 - here
1002:04 - is uh let's make another function okay
1002:07 - and let's call it user auth like so
1002:11 - get user auth okay this is what's going
1002:13 - to get the authentication info and uh
1002:16 - let's start it off with dispatch
1002:20 - cool and I'm gonna do this is something
1002:23 - that comes from Firebase so on off stay
1002:26 - changed do me a favor and run this
1002:29 - asynchronously
1002:31 - okay you're going to take a user as an
1002:33 - input and if user meaning if the user
1002:37 - exists or is logged in or whatever
1002:39 - dispatch set the user
1002:42 - set the user to user okay
1002:48 - so that looks good now let's go inside
1002:50 - of our app uh JS file and we're going to
1002:54 - add all of this here so
1002:56 - um let's go ahead and do that okay
1003:00 - so first of all I'm gonna need to
1003:03 - I'm going to need to do a couple of
1003:04 - things and for those things we're gonna
1003:06 - I'm gonna I'm gonna kind of walk you
1003:08 - through all of this okay
1003:10 - so first of all right at the start
1003:14 - here okay function app
1003:18 - um let me think let's have it and take
1003:21 - props like that
1003:23 - okay and then inside of here I'm
1003:26 - actually gonna throw in my use effect uh
1003:29 - hook so let's go use effect
1003:31 - and uh let's hit enter
1003:33 - whoops use effect okay
1003:37 - there's tons of boilerplate that comes
1003:39 - uh
1003:40 - with a lot of this stuff but okay so use
1003:42 - effect this is how we write it in here
1003:44 - okay so I'm going to say props Dot get
1003:47 - user auth
1003:49 - cool
1003:50 - and then here
1003:53 - it's not going to really have any
1003:54 - dependencies for now
1003:59 - cool
1004:00 - okay so now it's gonna start telling us
1004:03 - hey we're erroring out so let's go ahead
1004:05 - and import react hooks so import use
1004:10 - effect like so
1004:13 - all right so that's now going to import
1004:15 - this use effect good
1004:18 - use effect does not define interesting
1004:20 - should be defined
1004:24 - okay
1004:25 - so now it's saying get user auth is not
1004:27 - a function so we're going to go ahead
1004:28 - and import that as well import get user
1004:31 - auth
1004:33 - [Music]
1004:34 - okay
1004:37 - from
1004:39 - actions
1004:41 - okay
1004:42 - so now we got that as well it's good
1004:45 - cool so now of course it's saying it's
1004:48 - not a function but we're going to go
1004:49 - ahead and take care of that okay so
1004:51 - let's go ahead inside
1004:53 - um you know just get inside of app.js
1004:55 - hopefully you're there and now let's go
1004:57 - all the way to the bottom and we're
1004:58 - going to need to do those map to props
1005:00 - type of things okay this is very common
1005:02 - thing we have to do with the Redux if
1005:04 - you're using it without toolkit it's
1005:06 - annoying but has to be done okay so
1005:09 - we're gonna do that now right after take
1005:10 - out this fat ass wallet from my pocket
1005:13 - so let's go ahead and do this the map
1005:15 - state to props like so and we're going
1005:19 - to do state and let's go like this and
1005:21 - we're going to return
1005:23 - squigglies like that
1005:25 - okay then let's do const map dispatch
1005:29 - to props
1005:31 - okay we're gonna do this is gonna take
1005:33 - in something to dispatch
1005:35 - and uh get user auth and this is
1005:38 - actually what's going to start defining
1005:39 - your function okay and we're going to
1005:41 - say dispatch get user auth
1005:44 - function okay
1005:46 - and then what we're going to do is I'm
1005:49 - going to remove this export default line
1005:51 - we're going to export default I'm going
1005:53 - to say connect
1005:55 - okay we're also going to need access to
1005:56 - this connect
1005:58 - we're going to import it later I'm going
1006:00 - to do map
1006:02 - state to props and I'm going to do map
1006:05 - dispatch to props
1006:07 - and then let's just do app
1006:12 - okay now we're gonna need to import
1006:15 - connect so let's go ahead and import
1006:18 - connect
1006:22 - um
1006:23 - from Redux okay
1006:29 - import connect my bad from
1006:33 - from
1006:35 - react
1006:38 - Redux cool so
1006:41 - that's imported now what's the error
1006:43 - let's see identifier connect has already
1006:45 - been declared oh my bad I'm declaring uh
1006:48 - getting it too many times it's already
1006:49 - right here
1006:51 - cool we got connect
1006:52 - now it's your expected an assignment or
1006:55 - function call and instead saw an
1006:57 - expression line 37 and 16.
1007:01 - cool
1007:03 - so let's see
1007:07 - okay let's wrap that in parentheses so
1007:10 - it's an expression
1007:14 - okay
1007:17 - don't need that there
1007:26 - okay so now that should be good
1007:29 - should be good should be good that
1007:31 - allows us to get the user info
1007:33 - hopefully they're not getting any errors
1007:35 - and now we are on the same page
1007:38 - beautiful okay so the other annoying
1007:41 - thing that I realize guys is um remember
1007:44 - my image was not showing up the jobs add
1007:47 - one or whatever this one just kept not
1007:49 - showing up I looked at my console and it
1007:52 - was getting blocked by client for
1007:54 - whatever reason so what I decided to go
1007:57 - ahead do is like copy that image and
1007:59 - open a copy link address open that right
1008:02 - here right and then what what you can do
1008:04 - if you're having the same problems hit
1008:06 - save image as okay and go to that same
1008:10 - folder you have everything right so for
1008:11 - example for me GitHub
1008:14 - Banger projects LinkedIn clone uh public
1008:18 - images inside of that images folder I
1008:21 - just decided to call it jobs
1008:23 - ad.jpg okay
1008:26 - um and then I hit save so then it showed
1008:29 - up
1008:29 - as an image right there okay and then I
1008:34 - went to my right side component because
1008:37 - that's where it was supposed to show up
1008:38 - and it just was like never showing up
1008:40 - okay
1008:41 - so in the right side component in order
1008:44 - for it to show what I did is I went to
1008:47 - my banner card
1008:49 - and um
1008:51 - instead of having that static link I
1008:55 - just changed it with the actual image
1008:57 - okay so how you can do that is simply go
1009:00 - and select this slash Images slash jobs
1009:03 - at jpeg hit save
1009:06 - and then
1009:08 - uh this is what you should see
1009:11 - okay so go ahead and do that that'll
1009:13 - take care of that other problem that we
1009:15 - were having earlier okay and so if
1009:17 - somebody wants to be helpful please drop
1009:19 - the time stamp to when this problem was
1009:22 - first introduced okay and then um you
1009:26 - know and just say this is the bug fix
1009:27 - for that so if somebody's looking for it
1009:29 - that'll be really really helpful thank
1009:30 - you now let's go ahead and display the
1009:32 - user photo once the user is logged in so
1009:35 - I'm going to go inside of headerjs and
1009:37 - let's go to where we have user which is
1009:42 - user component okay so this user
1009:45 - component right here okay so where that
1009:47 - says me we're going to replace that with
1009:49 - an image of me
1009:51 - okay the image that I get from Google
1009:53 - authentication all right so here's how
1009:57 - that's gonna go
1009:59 - I'm gonna go right underneath this
1010:02 - a tag
1010:04 - cool and uh right underneath this a tag
1010:07 - what I'm gonna do is open up your
1010:09 - squiggly
1010:11 - okay
1010:13 - and
1010:15 - um let's be careful where we put
1010:17 - everything okay so
1010:19 - squiggly
1010:20 - let's do it this way
1010:24 - I'm in the wrong place okay remove that
1010:26 - quickly and remove that a needs to be
1010:28 - inside of user
1010:30 - okay
1010:33 - what did I do
1010:36 - what did I do
1010:37 - I'm sorry I'm confusing you okay
1010:41 - leave work alone leave work alone so it
1010:44 - should have that a tag in there you're
1010:46 - good you don't need to touch work we're
1010:48 - trying to touch user I don't know why I
1010:51 - decided to go under work probably I've
1010:53 - just been coding for so long I'm losing
1010:55 - my eyesight a little bit so bear with me
1010:56 - here okay I'm just a human being relax
1010:59 - so right over here what I'm going to do
1011:03 - is uh let's add a squiggly here
1011:07 - okay like that
1011:09 - okay
1011:10 - so the squiggly opens up here but here's
1011:12 - where we're gonna close it so remove the
1011:14 - closing one and I'm gonna close it right
1011:17 - above this span
1011:20 - just like that
1011:22 - okay that is um
1011:26 - that is perfecto
1011:27 - [Music]
1011:29 - okay that's the right spot for me to
1011:32 - close it cool so now let's go ahead and
1011:35 - make this work so inside of this
1011:38 - squiggly
1011:39 - we're gonna do a couple of things okay
1011:41 - I'm gonna say props dot user so if the
1011:45 - user is logged in and exists I want the
1011:48 - following to happen
1011:50 - props.user.photo URL
1011:53 - okay
1011:55 - so if that URL exists then I want
1012:00 - um the following to happen okay
1012:04 - so I'm going to make an image tag here
1012:07 - and in this image tag for source
1012:11 - what I'm going to say
1012:13 - is this
1012:15 - okay and you can remove the quotes
1012:18 - because this is going to evaluate to a
1012:20 - string anywhere once it's done so I'm
1012:21 - going to say props dot user.photo URL
1012:27 - okay
1012:28 - and let's end that
1012:31 - cool
1012:32 - and then I'm going to say colon
1012:37 - so like this
1012:39 - okay
1012:40 - now
1012:42 - this looks really intimidating and
1012:44 - confusing but let me explain
1012:47 - first
1012:48 - hey is the user logged in
1012:50 - yes they are they exist great then
1012:54 - look for their photo URL does that exist
1012:58 - question mark
1012:59 - if it exists then show their photo
1013:05 - then I have this ternary operator right
1013:07 - there if it doesn't exist
1013:10 - show a generic user photo capiche
1013:16 - that's what's happening there
1013:18 - another thing why my thing looks funny
1013:21 - why my this me part with the drop down
1013:24 - sign looks funny is because the drop
1013:25 - down is not inside of the span so let's
1013:29 - go ahead and uh
1013:31 - close that and sandwich that in the span
1013:33 - okay so again
1013:35 - span should have
1013:37 - the word me in it and the drop down
1013:40 - image in it
1013:41 - okay so make sure to go ahead and do
1013:44 - that and once you do that what's gonna
1013:47 - happen is now your photo and your me
1013:50 - with the drop down looks freaking great
1013:54 - okay that's what should happen alright
1013:56 - so that's looking good now what we need
1013:58 - to do is make sure our dispatch is
1014:00 - happening because right now
1014:03 - um our app does not know about the image
1014:05 - so it needs access to the store and we
1014:08 - need to dispatch that action okay so
1014:10 - then it's going to have access to the
1014:11 - photo so anyways long story short let's
1014:13 - go all the way to the bottom
1014:15 - and let's go ahead and do map state to
1014:18 - props like so state
1014:22 - whoops okay state
1014:27 - and then inside of here we're going to
1014:29 - return user
1014:31 - state.user state DOT user and knowing
1014:35 - boilerplate code
1014:37 - okay that's map state to props now we
1014:39 - also need map dispatch to props
1014:43 - and let's go dispatch
1014:48 - like this let's leave it empty for now
1014:51 - we don't really have anything going on
1014:53 - in here just yet and then this last line
1014:56 - where it says export default header
1014:58 - remove that line
1015:00 - so we're going to delete that line and
1015:03 - we're just going to do export default
1015:04 - connect and you guys know the drill
1015:08 - we're going to connect map state to
1015:10 - props like so then we're going to do map
1015:13 - dispatch to props
1015:16 - and then we're gonna do header like this
1015:21 - okie dokie Mr Pokey okay
1015:26 - so that is pretty good for now let me
1015:30 - actually just see if we need to change
1015:31 - any additional things at the top
1015:34 - should we import connect yes we did
1015:36 - import connect so that's looking good so
1015:39 - far
1015:40 - okay great so it is working uh in order
1015:42 - to be able to see it first of all it's
1015:45 - at the bottom right you should be seeing
1015:47 - your logged in photo because I'm logged
1015:48 - in and
1015:51 - you should be seeing your logged in
1015:52 - photo at the bottom right if you're
1015:54 - logged in
1015:55 - and at the top right you should actually
1015:57 - be seeing it if in desktop mode
1016:00 - okay so you should be seeing your photo
1016:02 - cool
1016:04 - amazing
1016:05 - okay now what we want to do is uh add
1016:08 - the ability to sign out so when I hover
1016:10 - over assign
1016:11 - um me right if I hit sign out I cannot
1016:14 - sign out so let's add that ability so
1016:18 - um let's go and start off
1016:21 - bye first of all inside of actions we're
1016:24 - now going to create a new file
1016:27 - actually no let's not create a new file
1016:29 - let's just go inside of our index.js so
1016:32 - in here remember we added the sign in
1016:34 - functionality and the get user auth
1016:37 - functionality
1016:39 - so let's go underneath that and let's
1016:41 - add the sign out functionality now so
1016:43 - let's do export function
1016:45 - sign out
1016:46 - API
1016:49 - okay
1016:51 - and then let's do return dispatch
1016:58 - just like this
1017:00 - all right inside of this dispatch all
1017:02 - we're going to do is uh we're gonna do
1017:04 - auths.sign out and again this comes
1017:07 - built in with Firebase okay that's why
1017:11 - Firebase is so nice
1017:13 - and then we're going to dot then okay
1017:16 - leave that empty
1017:18 - and we're going to do dispatch set user
1017:21 - to null okay so we're going to run that
1017:23 - function we're going to set the user to
1017:24 - null
1017:25 - okay that's going to remove any user
1017:27 - that's existing and then I'm going to do
1017:29 - that catch any errors
1017:32 - um
1017:33 - and if there are any errors just simply
1017:36 - console log them in this case
1017:39 - great so this is what your sign out API
1017:42 - should be looking like right now okay so
1017:44 - continuing on with our functionality now
1017:47 - we're gonna do just a few things okay so
1017:49 - let's go to our
1017:53 - um
1017:54 - when we sign out so let's think about
1017:57 - this right when we sign out we need to
1017:59 - be redirected back to the home page
1018:02 - right just like when we sign in we need
1018:05 - to be redirected back let me fix that
1018:07 - when we sign out we need to be
1018:09 - redirected to the login page just like
1018:12 - when we sign in we're redirected to the
1018:14 - home page okay so we're gonna work on
1018:16 - that
1018:18 - um that was Nas say hi to NAS everybody
1018:21 - behind me beautiful
1018:23 - so we're going to add that redirect in
1018:26 - just a second but first let's start off
1018:28 - with the functionality so I'm going to
1018:29 - go to my header okay and let's first of
1018:34 - all import the sign out functionality
1018:36 - that we made okay so let's import
1018:39 - sign out
1018:41 - API okay and where are we gonna import
1018:44 - that from well you know where we're
1018:46 - going to import that from from our
1018:48 - actions where we just finished making it
1018:50 - okay in the index.js
1018:54 - so now this will actually import it okay
1018:56 - why is saying module is not found
1018:59 - dot slash actions
1019:04 - oh my bad dot dot slash actions there we
1019:07 - go okay because I'm inside of headers
1019:11 - which is inside of components so I need
1019:12 - to back out first and then I have access
1019:16 - to this actions folder okay gotta back
1019:20 - out then boom hence the two dots right
1019:23 - there cool
1019:25 - okay so now inside of my sign out let's
1019:28 - find that so sign out is right there
1019:31 - and uh to just sign out all I'm going to
1019:33 - say is they on click I want you to do
1019:36 - something for me okay and sign out it's
1019:37 - gonna be like hey what do you want me to
1019:38 - do well on click
1019:40 - um I want to actually sign out
1019:44 - okay I want to call the sign out method
1019:47 - now
1019:48 - remember because we're using Redux you
1019:52 - can't just normally make this work
1019:53 - because that would make too much sense
1019:55 - unfortunately so in Redux you do things
1019:58 - always in a really obnoxious boilerplate
1020:02 - method thank you Dan abramov and the
1020:05 - founder of Redux
1020:07 - so I'm gonna go to my dispatch to props
1020:10 - and in here all I'm gonna do
1020:13 - is we're gonna add in sign out
1020:17 - and what signout is going to do is
1020:19 - dispatch and we're going to use our
1020:22 - method that we created earlier dispatch
1020:24 - sign out API okay
1020:27 - so that should already be pretty good
1020:30 - okay so let's go ahead and see if that
1020:33 - does anything or not so sign out whoa it
1020:36 - actually worked did you guys see the
1020:38 - photo change that's freaking amazing
1020:42 - so let's actually go back to our home
1020:44 - page and let's test this out let's hit
1020:46 - sign in
1020:47 - and it should redirect us to the home
1020:50 - page when I sign in so boom let me
1020:52 - choose my email
1020:53 - okay it redirected me and look my photo
1020:56 - is of the logged in user that photo is
1020:58 - being pulled straight from Firebase now
1021:00 - if I hover over and click sign out
1021:04 - it signed me out and the photo is gone
1021:06 - but what should happen when I sign out I
1021:10 - need to be redirected back to the login
1021:13 - page so let's just go ahead and add that
1021:16 - last bit of functionality and how we're
1021:18 - going to do that is let's start off by
1021:20 - going to our home page
1021:22 - and inside of our home page I need to
1021:25 - make sure that I import my redirect
1021:27 - [Music]
1021:29 - okay from
1021:31 - react router Dom because that's what
1021:34 - allows me to manipulate the Dom and
1021:36 - manipulate which Pages I'm at I also
1021:38 - need to import connect because I'm going
1021:41 - to need that for this from react
1021:44 - Redux and again this is Redux without
1021:47 - toolkit okay so this is why you still
1021:49 - have to do mappings and connects okay
1021:53 - now inside of my container right over
1021:56 - here here's what I'm gonna do
1021:59 - all right we're just going to add that
1022:01 - right there and I'm going to say hey if
1022:03 - the user is not logged in or there is no
1022:06 - user
1022:08 - then what I want you to do in that case
1022:10 - is redirect
1022:12 - me too
1022:14 - the home page or I'm sorry I keep saying
1022:16 - the home page but the login page in this
1022:18 - case okay and of course we want to close
1022:22 - this so let's go ahead and do that
1022:26 - Okay cool so now when I sign out it
1022:30 - actually brings me back to the home page
1022:32 - okay and last things I want to do in
1022:35 - order to make sure that that happens and
1022:37 - my store knows about it here's what I
1022:40 - need to do because that functionality is
1022:41 - still not necessarily working we're
1022:42 - going to do map state to props
1022:47 - and I'm going to let the state know
1022:50 - about hey user update the user State
1022:53 - like so
1022:55 - and I'm going to delete this line and
1022:58 - we're going to do export default and
1023:00 - this is what we've been doing with Redux
1023:01 - every single time so connect and map
1023:03 - state to props and we're just going to
1023:05 - leave it to that because we don't need
1023:07 - to dispatch any actions in this case
1023:10 - and of course at home just like this
1023:13 - okay so now refresh
1023:15 - so now watch what happens okay I'm gonna
1023:16 - sign in with Google
1023:19 - now it should update my photo at the
1023:21 - bottom right
1023:23 - now let me full screen it real quick
1023:26 - full screen hover over let's click sign
1023:28 - out and boom that works that is nice
1023:33 - right when I sign out it actually brings
1023:36 - me back straight to the home page
1023:40 - okay so hopefully you're enjoying this
1023:42 - so far and now we're gonna start
1023:43 - displaying the username right next to
1023:47 - um right next to our user profile okay
1023:49 - user image
1023:51 - all right so here we go so now we're
1023:53 - gonna actually add the user display
1023:55 - username on the left hand side okay
1023:58 - so
1023:59 - um and we're gonna do that
1024:01 - right there okay where it says welcome
1024:03 - rafikaze that's kind of what we're gonna
1024:05 - do in our own app okay so first of all
1024:07 - just let's just log in so it redirects
1024:09 - us to the home page
1024:12 - beautiful that looks good
1024:15 - okay but now it says welcome there well
1024:18 - it should know who we are so it
1024:20 - shouldn't say there it should actually
1024:21 - say our name now
1024:23 - so let's go ahead and do that so I'm
1024:25 - gonna go to my left side component that
1024:28 - I have
1024:29 - and then where we have this link this is
1024:32 - where we need to change it okay and
1024:33 - here's how we're going to do that so I'm
1024:35 - going to say it props that User it's
1024:37 - going to get me access to the user and
1024:38 - remember display name
1024:41 - this is what should get me access to the
1024:43 - name
1024:45 - um
1024:46 - so
1024:47 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
1024:49 - basically be like hey
1024:51 - if the user exists Okay so props.user
1024:56 - if the user exists this is a nice fancy
1025:00 - ternary operator that says then show me
1025:01 - the username otherwise show me blank
1025:05 - okay or I can just say show me well uh
1025:09 - there
1025:10 - okay
1025:12 - so that way it says there for now and
1025:14 - then if the user will be there it'll say
1025:16 - their name instead cool well why is it
1025:19 - not getting the name you might ask
1025:21 - well what we're gonna have to do is tell
1025:24 - Redux about it so this is where we need
1025:26 - to map state to props so let's do cons
1025:28 - map state to props like this
1025:34 - open this bad boy up and again we're
1025:37 - going to return user
1025:40 - state DOT user state
1025:42 - dot user like this okay
1025:46 - let's refresh
1025:48 - okay and we're gonna go ahead and
1025:50 - connect it now
1025:52 - to our component all right so let's go
1025:55 - here
1025:56 - boom
1025:57 - import connect like this from react
1026:01 - Redux so now we have this imported
1026:04 - that's great
1026:05 - let's go all the way down
1026:08 - there's a lot of lines of code in there
1026:10 - remove this and we're going to do export
1026:12 - default
1026:13 - connect map state to props
1026:18 - and we'll just do left side
1026:21 - like this
1026:22 - okay again we're not doing any
1026:24 - dispatching here we're only doing
1026:26 - reading and retrieving
1026:30 - all right so now rafikaze is being read
1026:33 - hey that's amazing right let me go home
1026:36 - rafikaze if I log out it should
1026:39 - basically be uh nobody okay
1026:43 - cool slash home
1026:46 - doesn't even let me go to home
1026:48 - okay when I log in it lets me go to home
1026:51 - so that's really good my authentication
1026:53 - it seems like it's working really well
1026:55 - and things are good now we're going to
1026:57 - start working on the modal okay so let's
1026:59 - go ahead to main.js
1027:01 - file and instead of post Malone we're
1027:05 - going to be working on post modal
1027:07 - huh
1027:09 - so congratulations
1027:13 - all right post modal
1027:15 - there we go
1027:17 - you like that one nice
1027:19 - all right and uh pretty much what I'm
1027:22 - gonna do is
1027:24 - right underneath where article is ending
1027:27 - and there's a div ending right
1027:28 - underneath the article let's go
1027:29 - underneath that div and I'm going to add
1027:32 - the post modal
1027:35 - okay and you'll be like hey Kazi
1027:38 - hey Kazi were you importing the pulse
1027:41 - model from that's a really good question
1027:43 - it doesn't exist yet so we need to go
1027:47 - ahead and make it so inside of
1027:48 - components I'm going to create a new
1027:51 - file it's going to be called
1027:53 - postmodal.js
1027:56 - okay and now we're going to start
1027:59 - working on this model and it's going to
1028:00 - be nice so let's start off with styled
1028:02 - from style components because we're
1028:04 - going to need to style this thing
1028:06 - and of course let's go ahead and go
1028:10 - it's gonna get some props okay there's
1028:13 - as arguments
1028:15 - and um I'm gonna create a new component
1028:19 - inside of here it's going to be a
1028:20 - container and I'm just going to say
1028:21 - pulse modal for now let's hit refresh
1028:24 - it's still complaining well that's
1028:25 - because I have to export default post
1028:28 - modal and now it should stop complaining
1028:31 - soon okay it goes hey I don't know what
1028:33 - container is no worries I'm going to
1028:35 - const container
1028:37 - and let's actually go styled div and
1028:39 - leave it as an empty cool so now all the
1028:43 - errors are gone
1028:44 - and we're back to an operational app
1028:47 - which is exactly what we want now inside
1028:49 - of our container we're going to style it
1028:51 - so I'm going to say position position
1028:55 - fixed
1028:57 - okay
1028:58 - where is our model I'll show you our
1029:01 - model will be available for us shortly
1029:04 - okay
1029:05 - let's go top zero for the modal
1029:10 - let's go left zero
1029:15 - okay and
1029:18 - um we're gonna start seeing it soon
1029:20 - hopefully
1029:21 - I'm as surprised as you when we see it
1029:23 - just kidding
1029:25 - all right bottom zero
1029:28 - okay so that allows us to put it at the
1029:30 - top we're gonna give it a really high Z
1029:32 - index okay so you just kind of you can
1029:34 - kind of do that that will make sure that
1029:36 - it's always on top of things so now
1029:37 - you're starting to see it post modal
1029:40 - okay and now zero zero zero zero it
1029:43 - means zero on the left axis x-axis
1029:46 - y-axis
1029:47 - and uh that's what you end up getting
1029:49 - when you go zero zero
1029:51 - so what this does here by the way right
1029:54 - is this zero zero zero you're wondering
1029:56 - what it does so hit come here and
1029:57 - inspect the element now when I inspect
1029:59 - it look the modal is actually over the
1030:01 - entire screen okay and uh if I actually
1030:06 - change this to 10 pixels or let's go 50
1030:09 - pixels so something visible from the top
1030:12 - it's pushing it down but notice now it's
1030:14 - not the entire screen so why we do that
1030:16 - sometimes zero zero zero zero like that
1030:19 - is to kind of in an easy way say hey
1030:21 - take over the entire browser okay so
1030:25 - this right now is taking over the entire
1030:27 - browser and it has a massive Z index so
1030:30 - it'll also take over more priority
1030:34 - cool so now inside of color I'm going to
1030:37 - give it color black
1030:40 - and just to kind of show you this right
1030:42 - if I actually gave it a background color
1030:44 - of let's say black Watch What Happens
1030:46 - boom my entire screen is now gone black
1030:50 - okay and if I give it a z index of
1030:53 - negative 20 now it's hiding behind but
1030:56 - you can still see the little black bars
1030:58 - on the side okay
1030:59 - so that's the index just to make sure
1031:01 - that always stays on top of everything
1031:03 - else and instead of black of course it's
1031:06 - a crazy color to give it right now
1031:09 - um we're going to just give it
1031:13 - um
1031:14 - 0.8 just like this okay that's what's
1031:16 - going to happen when the modal opens
1031:18 - that's what's going to happen to the
1031:19 - entire screen that's what we want okay
1031:22 - so then we can see the modal easily so
1031:24 - that's how we make that happen cool now
1031:27 - last thing we want to do is I mean we're
1031:29 - already exporting it and we're using it
1031:32 - in main.js right so let's go to our main
1031:34 - and we have pulse modal that's how we're
1031:38 - getting this
1031:39 - cool beautiful and make sure we're
1031:41 - imported okay perfect good job so far
1031:44 - let's keep rocking and rolling and now
1031:46 - we're gonna start adding main content
1031:48 - component inside of post modal so let's
1031:50 - go to post model
1031:52 - and inside of here I'm going to remove
1031:55 - where it says post modal okay and I'm
1031:58 - going to say content cool inside of
1032:01 - content let's just write content for now
1032:03 - and leave it pretty blank and we're
1032:06 - going to add in a new styled component
1032:09 - I'm going to say content with a style
1032:11 - div of course empty to just start it off
1032:13 - with and we'll give it a width of a
1032:17 - hundred percent okay
1032:20 - cool
1032:22 - all right Max width will give it of 552
1032:28 - pixels
1032:29 - so it will never be bigger than that
1032:31 - we're going to give it a background
1032:33 - color of white
1032:36 - so now we can actually start to see this
1032:39 - okay
1032:41 - cool so we can see that the model is
1032:44 - starting to become visible and now what
1032:46 - we're going to do is let's give it a
1032:48 - let's remove that
1032:50 - uh let's actually keep that my bad and
1032:52 - let's go and give it a Max height of 90
1032:55 - percent
1032:57 - cool
1032:59 - overflow will go initial
1033:03 - okay and then let's go
1033:05 - border radius of 5 pixels
1033:09 - okay so now we're starting to have
1033:11 - slightly rounded Corners right there
1033:16 - we'll go position
1033:20 - relative
1033:22 - display Flex okay
1033:25 - and now let's do Flex Direction column
1033:28 - in this case
1033:30 - cool
1033:32 - well top 32 pixels
1033:36 - that pushes it down and we're gonna go
1033:39 - margin zero Auto

1033:45 - the middle
1033:46 - showing up exactly where we want it
1033:49 - beautiful
1033:50 - so that's all we wanted to do for this
1033:52 - and now we're going to add header and
1033:54 - post modal component okay so let's go
1033:57 - and do that so inside of content I'm
1034:00 - gonna remove content and I'm just gonna
1034:02 - go header like this

1034:49 - let's go grab that close icon and drop
1034:52 - it inside of our images now you should
1034:54 - have access to it
1034:56 - okay let's go back to the code that we
1034:58 - were on inside of components
1035:00 - postmodal.js
1035:02 - so we added that image and now we're
1035:05 - going to actually create styling for
1035:07 - that component so cons header
1035:11 - let's start right off with blank
1035:13 - and then let's go ahead and start now
1035:15 - styling it okay

1036:18 - let's go justify content on this thing
1036:22 - and we'll go space
1036:25 - between so now that X should springboard
1036:28 - over all the way to the right hand side
1036:31 - I'm gonna go align item Center
1036:36 - dope and then of course let's style the
1036:39 - button and I'm gonna go height 40 pixels

1038:24 - user info is not defined
1038:26 - you guys know the drill
1038:29 - right you guys know what we do
1038:31 - let's go ahead and start working on this
1038:33 - right style div

1038:39 - user info style div
1038:42 - like that
1038:44 - oh
1038:45 - refresh
1038:48 - okay so now that image is showing up but
1038:50 - it obviously looks crazy so we're gonna
1038:53 - Now work on it
1038:55 - let's enable display Flex to start off
1038:57 - things are already starting to look in
1039:00 - control display Flex is such magic Flex
1039:04 - Direction
1039:05 - column
1039:08 - Flex grow

1039:25 - cool
1039:26 - background I'm gonna do transparent

1039:33 - and then of course padding
1039:36 - eight pixels by 12 pixels
1039:39 - beautiful
1039:42 - great now let's inside of our user info
1039:45 - let's go ahead and do a couple of things
1039:49 - enable display Flex here I'm going to
1039:52 - align my items to the center
1039:55 - so I can see that n is in the middle but
1039:58 - it's still behind the photo
1040:01 - add padding 12 pixels by 24 pixels like
1040:05 - so
1040:06 - cool and now let's control our SVG and
1040:09 - our images and we're going to give them
1040:11 - the same type of styling
1040:14 - boom
1040:17 - boom cool background
1040:22 - clip I'm gonna go content box
1040:27 - okay border two pixels solid transparent
1040:33 - border radius this is going to give it a
1040:36 - nice little circle that we always love
1040:40 - looking clean and then of course let's
1040:44 - go inside of our span and now we're
1040:46 - gonna go font wait 600
1040:49 - font size 16 pixels
1040:52 - line height
1040:56 - 1.5 cool so now the text is looking
1041:00 - Bolder and then of course let's give it
1041:02 - a little bit of margin because it's
1041:04 - getting a little too close to that logo
1041:06 - so let's
1041:07 - push it a little bit
1041:09 - okay
1041:11 - beautiful so
1041:13 - that looks great to me
1041:16 - for shared content right this model is
1041:18 - looking good I mean of course we still
1041:20 - need to add functionality so when I hit
1041:21 - X it actually goes away right and things
1041:25 - like that so we're gonna now start
1041:26 - adding those things in
1041:29 - okay we also need to make sure the text
1041:32 - editor is editable so that's going to
1041:34 - need
1041:35 - um you know quite a bit of work so let's
1041:36 - work on that now
1041:40 - all right so cool let's start working on
1041:42 - the text editor and add in bunch of
1041:43 - functionality so I am going to go
1041:47 - um in I mean I'm I'm gonna just stay in
1041:49 - my post model okay and then um let's add
1041:53 - another component and I'm going to add
1041:55 - it right underneath shared content so
1041:57 - we're going to call it share creation
1041:59 - like this and let's just type in some
1042:01 - word in there like actions let's go all
1042:03 - the way down and I'm going to add a
1042:06 - component styling for this styled div
1042:09 - hit save just so that error stops
1042:12 - display Flex so you guys you should be
1042:16 - able to see the actions in there now
1042:18 - okay it should be it's right there boom
1042:20 - cool now I'm going to do justify content
1042:24 - space between cool and then of course
1042:28 - padding 12 pixels 24 by 16. cool so now
1042:33 - we just added some padding kind of
1042:36 - everywhere from every direction so
1042:39 - that looks that looks good now we're
1042:42 - gonna add creation buttons okay so you
1042:44 - might be wondering hey are you getting
1042:46 - the creation buttons from here so we're
1042:48 - going to have the share image okay that
1042:50 - image right there at the top and we're
1042:51 - also going to have that image the video
1042:53 - image as well so share image share video
1042:56 - I'm going to drag this into my images
1043:00 - and drop cool so that's going to be
1043:03 - there now let's go inside of my
1043:07 - um right underneath share creation
1043:10 - inside of shared creation I'm going to
1043:12 - remove the word actions and instead I'm
1043:15 - going to write attach assets okay and
1043:18 - let's create a new component called
1043:19 - attach assets okay and instead of attach
1043:22 - assets let's create a new component
1043:25 - called asset button
1043:27 - like that and inside of asset button I'm
1043:30 - going to add an image and that image is
1043:33 - going to be Images slash
1043:35 - share.mage.svg cool and then I'm going
1043:38 - to have another asset button asset
1043:41 - button
1043:42 - and inside of that I'm going to have
1043:44 - another image that's going to be Images
1043:45 - slash
1043:46 - sharevideo.svg like so
1043:49 - cool now let's go ahead and add this so
1043:52 - all the way at the bottom let's do const
1043:54 - asset
1043:55 - button is equal to styled button
1043:59 - okay and I'm gonna do
1044:01 - let's do display Flex on this thing
1044:05 - um of course it's saying that error so
1044:07 - let's actually start that styling too so
1044:11 - we we don't have that error anymore
1044:14 - styled div
1044:17 - okay boom so we got the image here and
1044:19 - then we got the video button right there
1044:21 - okay that's what we were trying to add
1044:23 - so now let's go here and do align items
1044:26 - Center
1044:28 - height will make it 40 pixels
1044:32 - give it a Min width of Auto
1044:36 - color I'm gonna go rgba zero zero zero
1044:40 - zero point five
1044:42 - okay
1044:44 - and then under attach assets
1044:47 - let's do a line items
1044:49 - Center
1044:51 - to display flex and let's go padding
1044:55 - padding right and I'll go eight pixels
1044:58 - on it boom
1045:01 - okay beautiful so we got this we got the
1045:06 - buttons
1045:07 - and we got some styling for for this uh
1045:11 - uh acid button at least okay so let's
1045:14 - finish up the styling for attach Assets
1045:17 - Now
1045:18 - okay so I'm gonna go
1045:19 - right here
1045:21 - and we're gonna use the select this
1045:23 - selector here to get our style component
1045:27 - called asset button and we're going to
1045:29 - style that to be with 40 pixels like
1045:33 - this
1045:34 - cool
1045:35 - so now that should be good okay if I
1045:38 - made that 100 pixels it'll be really
1045:41 - obvious what happens so if I go 100
1045:43 - pixels like that you can obviously see
1045:45 - that just buttons got really long but
1045:48 - let's go 40 pixels
1045:50 - and they're right there cool so that
1045:53 - looks good and now let's add share uh

1046:07 - all right let's drag that into our
1046:09 - images folder
1046:10 - okay and then let's go to our post modal
1046:13 - and inside of our post model let's make
1046:16 - that work
1046:18 - so where am I doing share comments so
1046:24 - let's go underneath attach assets

1046:30 - assets
1046:32 - all right let's go now share comment
1046:36 - like that
1046:37 - and then inside of share comment I will
1046:41 - add

1047:12 - let's wrap that new button that we made
1047:14 - inside of share comment component okay
1047:17 - so I'll go here
1047:19 - go here and paste it
1047:22 - okay so this is what it should look like
1047:25 - share common component now it's going to
1047:28 - complain about share comment component
1047:30 - but you and I we don't worry about that
1047:33 - because we know this
1047:35 - we go ahead and create the style
1047:37 - component like this
1047:39 - keep it blank and then let's add some
1047:42 - padding left
1047:43 - okay let's go ahead and let's go and add
1047:48 - margin right Auto
1047:50 - cool
1047:53 - let's go border left one pixel solid
1047:57 - rgba

1048:10 - gonna say asset button select asset
1048:14 - button and inside of that button any
1048:16 - svgs we have let's give it a margin
1048:18 - right of five pixels
1048:21 - cool
1048:22 - so that looks good the share comment
1048:25 - component it's kind of done now let's
1048:28 - add the post button
1048:31 - and how I'm going to do it is like this
1048:33 - so let's go
1048:35 - right underneath the share comment
1048:38 - and let's add in the button right here
1048:40 - okay so I'm gonna go post button
1048:43 - and let's just say post
1048:46 - now let's go ahead and add that to our
1048:48 - styling so I'm going to do cons post
1048:50 - button is equal to styled button cool so
1048:55 - again start off with empty and now that
1048:57 - button is there I can see it
1049:01 - Min with 60 pixels
1049:05 - cool
1049:06 - border radius 20 pixels
1049:11 - I like how it's looking padding left 16
1049:15 - pixels
1049:16 - cool let's add some padding right by 16
1049:20 - pixels okay so now it's made it a little
1049:22 - bit bigger background
1049:26 - like this
1049:28 - okay give it a little blue we'll color
1049:31 - it white
1049:33 - okay
1049:35 - and then on Hover
1049:38 - so I'll do this on Hover
1049:41 - we're going to give it a background of
1049:45 - that
1049:46 - right there cool
1049:49 - so when I hover boom just a little bit
1049:51 - extra blue click it and I can press it
1049:55 - okay beautiful all right so now that we
1049:57 - added that post button let's remove the
1050:00 - remove close button image okay and we're
1050:04 - gonna do some stuff with being able to
1050:07 - hide it and show it so when we hit X we
1050:09 - want things to be able to happen Okay so
1050:11 - let's go and work on that now
1050:13 - okay and um I was gonna work on the text
1050:17 - editor earlier but let's go and work on
1050:19 - it now okay so let's go ahead and work
1050:22 - on the text editor cool so no worries in
1050:25 - post modal what I'm gonna do is all the
1050:28 - way at the top okay
1050:31 - let's go import use State like this okay
1050:35 - let's use react States
1050:37 - because we're gonna need to work with
1050:39 - State now
1050:40 - and uh let's just
1050:42 - let's start so here I'm going to say
1050:46 - editor text and then we're going to do
1050:48 - set editor text so this is going to be a
1050:51 - function that allows us to change the
1050:52 - text
1050:53 - all right that's kind of how you also
1050:54 - set variables in react the react way of
1050:57 - setting variables and we're going to
1050:59 - start off with it being blank
1051:01 - okay so the functionality we're working
1051:03 - on now is this one so when I hit start a
1051:06 - post
1051:07 - this modal pops up the text in the start
1051:10 - is blank and then as I start typing it
1051:12 - it updates the text so we're going to do
1051:14 - that in our app that's not built yet
1051:17 - cool so let's go underneath user info
1051:24 - okay
1051:26 - so underneath user info I'm going to
1051:28 - make my editor component
1051:31 - and uh editor component is going to take
1051:34 - in the text area actually let's before I
1051:37 - make my editor component let's leave it
1051:38 - blank let's start off with uh just doing
1051:42 - text area like this
1051:45 - um
1051:46 - cool I'm going to remove
1051:49 - just go ahead and remove all of this for
1051:52 - now
1051:53 - all right and what I will say is inside
1051:56 - of text area let's add something for
1051:59 - value
1052:00 - so we're going to make value be the
1052:03 - editor text so whatever the state of the
1052:07 - text is
1052:08 - okay so right now it's not really going
1052:11 - to be doing much so when I type it
1052:12 - doesn't do anything it just kind of
1052:13 - freezes that's what should be happening
1052:15 - with yours
1052:16 - okay
1052:17 - then after text I want to do on change I
1052:20 - want something to happen okay and what
1052:22 - do I want to happen on change
1052:24 - I want to take
1052:28 - let's go like this
1052:29 - I'm gonna
1052:31 - take whatever the value you're giving me
1052:33 - and I want to set it to the editor text
1052:37 - so I'm going to do e.target.value so
1052:39 - whatever you're typing
1052:41 - okay
1052:42 - [Music]
1052:43 - it's complaining e is not defined okay
1052:46 - not to worry we're going to take care of
1052:49 - that shortly okay so we have on change
1052:51 - and we have the on change ending right
1052:54 - there cool let's go ahead and add the
1052:57 - placeholder as well in just a second all
1053:00 - right just make sure you refresh as soon
1053:02 - as you refresh you should be good to go
1053:04 - and all that's happening is as soon as I
1053:07 - do I type in F in the text area now it
1053:12 - calls this on change okay it goes on
1053:15 - change what should I do on change says
1053:17 - hey grab the event okay what was the
1053:21 - event
1053:22 - I wrote this thing so now what we do is
1053:26 - we
1053:27 - change the editor text variable's value
1053:30 - which was blank in the start with
1053:33 - whatever the target value is in this
1053:34 - case that's f
1053:36 - so now this editor text here becomes F
1053:39 - and then it shows F now I'm going to
1053:41 - write f e it becomes f e it passes that
1053:46 - here that passes that here and then that
1053:50 - shows that there super confusing but
1053:53 - that's what's happening okay and then if
1053:55 - I hit post I have access to all of that
1053:58 - information so now let's do placeholder
1054:02 - whoops
1054:04 - let's not do that
1054:05 - placeholder
1054:07 - okay and then my place was giving me
1054:10 - what do you want to talk about
1054:14 - cool
1054:17 - so if you remove everything that's the
1054:19 - that's what the placeholder will be and
1054:22 - of course let's also do Auto
1054:25 - Focus to be
1054:28 - true
1054:30 - okay so as far as my text areas can
1054:33 - concerned that's looking good now what
1054:36 - I'm going to do is I'm actually going to
1054:38 - create my styled component I'm going to
1054:40 - do this one the other way so let's go
1054:42 - ahead and create a style component
1054:44 - called editor and do style div
1054:48 - okay and I'm going to and I'm going to
1054:51 - style it in just a second let's go and
1054:54 - add
1054:55 - let's go and take what we created this
1054:58 - text area and we're going to wrap this
1055:01 - entire text area inside of our a new
1055:04 - component called editor
1055:07 - so make sure you cut that and you wrap
1055:10 - the text area inside of editor just like
1055:12 - this
1055:13 - okay now we need to style our editor
1055:17 - component okay great let's add some
1055:22 - padding
1055:24 - and I'll go 12 pixels by 24 pixels like
1055:28 - so
1055:29 - let's now style the text area inside of
1055:32 - this editor let's go with 100 percent
1055:37 - gold is Big let's give it a Min height
1055:40 - of 100 pixels
1055:43 - great
1055:44 - do anything yes I made it fat which is
1055:47 - exactly what we want
1055:48 - and then resize none
1055:52 - okay so now so notice this little touch
1055:55 - right if I have resize enabled at the
1055:58 - bottom right you see this resize and I
1056:00 - can resize it to whatever I want right
1056:02 - boom it's kind of weird by doing resize
1056:05 - none it now there's nothing there's no
1056:08 - way to resize this that's what we want
1056:12 - let's go here and let's go input
1056:16 - with 100
1056:19 - beautiful
1056:21 - okay
1056:22 - so whatever we're writing here input
1056:24 - cool
1056:25 - height of 35 pixels
1056:28 - cool
1056:30 - font size of 16 pixels
1056:35 - okay
1056:37 - all right and then right underneath it
1056:40 - we're gonna go margin bottom 20 pixels
1056:45 - okay great
1056:48 - our text box looks text box looks
1056:52 - absolutely great we're using uh state to
1056:55 - do a bunch of stuff and that's good now
1056:58 - again let's focus back on being able to
1057:01 - open the modal and close the modal this
1057:03 - is something very common that you have
1057:05 - to do in react and we're going to start
1057:07 - working on that now so let's go ahead
1057:10 - and get started
1057:11 - so where should we get started well
1057:16 - the first thing I want to do
1057:18 - is um inside of main I'm gonna add the
1057:22 - ability to hide and show the modal
1057:26 - cool
1057:29 - so let's go all the way at the top we're
1057:31 - going to import State because we're
1057:33 - going to need access to it so use
1057:35 - state
1057:37 - and I'm going to say from react
1057:40 - okay now underneath Main
1057:43 - I'm gonna do show modal set show modal
1057:47 - like this
1057:49 - my bad use State and um
1057:53 - default is going to be a closed State
1057:55 - okay so by default it's going to be just
1057:57 - always closed
1058:00 - [Music]
1058:02 - all right now right underneath here
1058:04 - let's add
1058:06 - the code to make it
1058:09 - um hide and show the model so let's get
1058:12 - started on that so I'm gonna do handle
1058:16 - click
1058:18 - and here's what we're gonna do
1058:22 - okay so we're going to start it off by
1058:24 - preventing the default Behavior which is
1058:27 - important for react so you don't have
1058:28 - these weird refreshing things going on
1058:31 - when you don't want them
1058:34 - okay
1058:37 - all right
1058:40 - let's go let's stay here
1058:43 - outside of our if statement and now I'm
1058:46 - gonna just add a little switch statement
1058:47 - and I'm just going to say show modal
1058:50 - all right
1058:52 - and in the case that I get an open
1058:57 - what I want you to do is the following I
1058:59 - want you to
1059:02 - set it to close
1059:04 - and then break
1059:06 - okay
1059:07 - in the other case where it's closed
1059:12 - then what I want you to do is I want you
1059:15 - to
1059:18 - show modal to be open
1059:21 - okay
1059:24 - and break
1059:27 - in the case oh actually otherwise let's
1059:31 - just do default
1059:33 - set show model to be just closed by
1059:36 - default
1059:37 - okay and then we'll break right there
1059:41 - beautiful
1059:42 - so that seems simple enough now let's
1059:44 - actually go to the button and add that
1059:46 - functionality
1059:48 - where's my button
1059:51 - user SVG yep so start a post
1059:55 - that's where we're gonna add it so let's
1059:57 - go on click equals and I'm going to say
1060:00 - handle
1060:02 - handle click
1060:04 - okay great
1060:06 - and uh where I have post modal let's
1060:09 - scroll down scroll down
1060:11 - where I have post modal I'm gonna give
1060:13 - it show modal
1060:15 - pass at the current state of the modal
1060:17 - okay so it's going to take a prop that's
1060:19 - show modal prop and we'll add in the
1060:22 - functionality for that prop in just a
1060:24 - second okay and then the handle click
1060:27 - prop it's going to just do
1060:30 - handle click
1060:32 - actually we're probably just taking in
1060:34 - props so we'll probably have to do props
1060:36 - dot show modal and props dot handle
1060:38 - click
1060:40 - so let's go ahead and check that out
1060:41 - let's go to pulse modal
1060:44 - um
1060:46 - dope and inside of my post model I want
1060:49 - to do just a few things
1060:53 - so right underneath that text that we're
1060:56 - editing
1060:57 - let's go ahead and do the following I'm
1060:59 - gonna do
1061:01 - I'm going to create a reset
1061:04 - all right and this reset is going to
1061:06 - take in
1061:08 - an event
1061:09 - and it's going to set the editor text
1061:13 - to be blank and it's also going to
1061:16 - handle
1061:18 - click
1061:19 - [Music]
1061:21 - and handle the event
1061:25 - okay so I'm going to wrap the whole
1061:29 - thing in a jsx fragment all the way down
1061:33 - to this container here
1061:37 - okay so let's just start off with that
1061:39 - and then what I'm gonna do is I'm also
1061:41 - going to wrap the entire thing in these
1061:43 - squiggly brackets
1061:46 - like this
1061:49 - cool now within here what I'm going to
1061:51 - say is I'm going to say props dot show
1061:54 - model
1061:55 - equals open if that's true
1061:59 - then what I want you to do is
1062:02 - show me all of this stuff here
1062:07 - okay and what I'm going to do to my
1062:09 - button let's go to my where is my
1062:13 - creative post create a post right so
1062:16 - right underneath that I have a button
1062:18 - okay and what to that button I'm gonna
1062:21 - do on click
1062:24 - on click
1062:26 - taking an event
1062:29 - okay
1062:31 - and call my reset function and give it
1062:36 - my give it my event okay that's what I
1062:39 - want to happen when I click X
1062:42 - so now
1062:46 - um oh also let's go all the way down
1062:49 - and where do I have my SVG
1062:52 - inside of my header
1062:56 - const header where's my header styling
1063:01 - right there
1063:03 - let's also do comma IMG to it okay
1063:07 - let's add an image to it as well
1063:09 - cool let's refresh
1063:11 - let's full screen this thing let's hit
1063:13 - start a post ooh hit X nice look at that
1063:18 - that worked I can't believe that worked
1063:22 - I really thought it was gonna break
1063:24 - boom boom
1063:27 - look at that model and look the whole
1063:30 - screen goes dark because that we have
1063:32 - that you know that post modal div that
1063:35 - takes over the entire screen when I
1063:36 - click it when I hit X it goes and it's
1063:39 - done
1063:41 - okay that modal is a very beautiful
1063:43 - functionality so great work on adding
1063:46 - that I'm proud of you okay and if you're
1063:49 - proud of you then smash that like button
1063:51 - okay just for yourself if not for me I'm
1063:54 - proud of you
1063:56 - let's keep going now we're going to add
1063:59 - a smooth fade that's going to fade these
1064:01 - things out
1064:03 - so here's how we're gonna do that let's
1064:05 - go to pulse modal and inside of our post
1064:07 - model let's go all the way down to
1064:09 - container
1064:11 - and right underneath here I'm just going
1064:13 - to say animation fade in
1064:17 - and let's do something like 0.3 seconds
1064:19 - that's 300 milliseconds
1064:23 - okay I do something I don't know
1064:26 - that didn't do anything then we're gonna
1064:29 - have to make it do something
1064:30 - start a post
1064:33 - cool
1064:34 - let's go to our index.css and we're
1064:37 - going to make it do something
1064:39 - all right so I'm now in my index.css
1064:42 - file which is of course
1064:44 - inside of source so let me close out of
1064:48 - my images and close out of my public
1064:50 - close actions
1064:54 - okay so inside of source I have
1064:56 - index.css let's go there
1064:58 - let's go all the way down and let's make
1065:01 - let's make that fade in mean something
1065:04 - and do something so I'm going to say
1065:05 - webkit keyframes let's go fade in and
1065:09 - what fade in
1065:11 - his job is going to be
1065:15 - is this
1065:16 - from opacity
1065:19 - of zero
1065:22 - what we want you to do is go to an
1065:24 - opacity of one
1065:28 - and now we're gonna also Define standard
1065:31 - keyframes
1065:34 - let's remove all of this
1065:36 - [Music]
1065:39 - Let's do an at sign right there
1065:43 - okay save because it's still complaining
1065:46 - failing to compile that should be good
1065:49 - start oh look at that fading start a
1065:52 - post click
1065:57 - yo that looks beautiful that is freaking
1065:59 - beautiful
1066:01 - that's all I gotta say
1066:03 - that's all I gotta say
1066:06 - all right that modal work was just
1066:10 - beautiful okay now let's keep going
1066:14 - beautiful so now we got that working now
1066:16 - we're gonna disable the post button when
1066:19 - the editor text is um
1066:22 - empty okay because right now even when
1066:25 - the editor text is not empty I can hit
1066:27 - post so we don't want that we don't want
1066:30 - that okay cool so let's go ahead to post
1066:33 - modal and let's start adding that
1066:35 - functionality so let's go to our post
1066:37 - button
1066:39 - and um inside of our post button All I'm
1066:42 - gonna say is this I'm Gonna Save
1066:46 - disabled
1066:48 - okay when the editor text state is empty
1066:52 - when it just doesn't exist okay if it's
1066:55 - so give me true so give me disable true
1066:59 - if the text is empty otherwise give me
1067:01 - false cool
1067:03 - that's essentially it
1067:06 - cool disable old
1067:09 - old
1067:10 - D just like that
1067:14 - okay so now because of the styling and
1067:17 - stuff like that you can't really see it
1067:18 - but it's actually disabled right now
1067:20 - because there's no borders around it but
1067:22 - I type the borders appear okay but it's
1067:25 - just like a little hard to see so we're
1067:27 - gonna go ahead and add some styling to
1067:29 - it so let's go to
1067:31 - our post button so I'm going to command
1067:33 - f
1067:34 - post button component and let's add some
1067:37 - styling to this so inside of
1067:41 - background here's what we're going to do
1067:44 - we're gonna do some cool ways of styling
1067:46 - now
1067:48 - props dot this I'm going to do it this
1067:52 - way okay let's go get access to the
1067:53 - props
1067:54 - and if the props is disabled question
1067:57 - mark then I want you to style it in this
1068:00 - way zero zero zero zero point eight
1068:05 - okay
1068:06 - and if you're not disabled then I want
1068:09 - you to style it in a different way so
1068:11 - like what we had earlier
1068:14 - so now this is going to be really
1068:16 - freaking cool
1068:18 - whoa what the hell happened it looks
1068:20 - ugly as hell
1068:22 - what the heck happened
1068:25 - we lost all of our styling
1068:28 - [Music]
1068:30 - oh man the app is going all over the
1068:32 - place
1068:33 - all right let's take that out of
1068:35 - parentheses here
1068:38 - um I mean it doesn't really matter but
1068:40 - prettier wants me to do it the other way
1068:42 - oh and why am I going blind let's
1068:46 - um close this freaking parentheses right
1068:49 - there right because that would only make
1068:51 - sense
1068:52 - and then that closes that
1068:55 - cool
1068:57 - ah yeah look at that okay
1069:02 - my post is dark I write and now it's
1069:06 - blue this is why I love styled
1069:09 - components you guys because
1069:11 - I'm just I'm saying if it's disabled
1069:13 - give it this color if it's enabled give
1069:16 - it this color and it's just so freaking
1069:18 - nice it's just so freaking nice
1069:22 - okay
1069:24 - um and now I also want to change the
1069:26 - text color Okay so let's go ahead and
1069:28 - change the text color because right now
1069:29 - just white that's not what we want so
1069:32 - let's go props and I'm gonna go props
1069:34 - disabled okay if it's disabled then do
1069:37 - the following
1069:39 - of course open close this
1069:42 - okay and then outside of this just give
1069:45 - me white okay
1069:48 - so when it's disabled it's hard to see
1069:50 - it when it's enabled boom okay so that's
1069:54 - what it I want that to happen with the
1069:55 - colors it's good it's good
1069:57 - okay cool and then on Hover I also want
1070:01 - to give it a dynamic functionality okay
1070:04 - so I'm going to say props
1070:07 - and if it's disabled again
1070:09 - let's go ahead and do
1070:13 - zero zero zero
1070:16 - zero point eight like that actually
1070:20 - let's do 0.0
1070:23 - zero point yeah 0.08 okay
1070:28 - or
1070:30 - in the other case give me
1070:34 - this
1070:36 - okay am I closing my parentheses right
1070:38 - yes I am on Hover
1070:41 - beautiful
1070:42 - okay
1070:44 - that's all that's happening
1070:46 - cool so when I hover over it gives me
1070:48 - like a lighter gray uh in the disabled
1070:51 - mode okay and then when I write
1070:54 - then it gives me this one when I hover
1070:57 - over on this thing right boom boom boom
1071:00 - beautiful that's exactly what I want and
1071:04 - that's really really good now we're
1071:06 - going to start adding file input for
1071:09 - uploading images and that allows us to
1071:12 - upload a file from our computer and add
1071:15 - it to this and that's really nice
1071:16 - functionality if you're going to a
1071:18 - recruiter you can show them that
1071:20 - functionality okay they're going to be
1071:21 - blown away so let's go ahead and start
1071:23 - adding that now
1071:26 - so file input where do we start well we
1071:29 - start in post model let's go all the way
1071:30 - to the top
1071:32 - and right underneath this let's go ahead
1071:35 - and add share image set
1071:38 - share image
1071:41 - all right
1071:42 - and I'm gonna go use state
1071:45 - leave it blank
1071:47 - cool
1071:50 - um and then what I want to do is I want
1071:51 - to handle the change as it happens
1071:56 - okay we're gonna get the first element
1071:58 - from the files
1072:00 - and if the image is blank
1072:06 - or
1072:07 - image is
1072:10 - undefined
1072:13 - okay in those two cases
1072:15 - I want to basically say hey
1072:20 - uh not an image the image file is a
1072:24 - and then we're gonna be able to access
1072:27 - instead type of image
1072:30 - cool so that's gonna be great if this is
1072:33 - going to help me figure out like what
1072:35 - the actual error is and what's the type
1072:37 - of the image
1072:39 - and then otherwise
1072:41 - I'm just going to return
1072:48 - and I'm going to return right here
1072:51 - return
1072:53 - cool and now right underneath that let's
1072:56 - go set share image
1072:59 - okay so meaning if we don't get an error
1073:03 - then do this thing
1073:05 - and when I do this thing it's going to
1073:07 - update that variable right there share
1073:10 - image cool
1073:13 - cool cool cool beans now let's go ahead
1073:16 - and actually add the upload image
1073:18 - component
1073:20 - so I'll add the upload image component
1073:23 - uh kind of right underneath the text
1073:26 - area
1073:27 - all right so text area what I'm going to
1073:30 - do is I'm going to remove this and I'm
1073:32 - just going to end it right there so just
1073:33 - a little bit tad bit cleaner and right
1073:37 - underneath the text area I'm going to
1073:39 - add the upload image component
1073:44 - and let's just go ahead and give it a
1073:46 - empty styling for now before we start
1073:48 - doing other things to it upload image is
1073:51 - equal to styled
1073:53 - div and just leave it empty for now and
1073:55 - that way we don't get into errors as I'm
1073:57 - writing it so you can see it build out
1074:00 - upload image right there
1074:03 - and let's go input
1074:07 - type type is going to be file
1074:11 - so already just by doing type file for
1074:14 - input I can now choose file and it
1074:16 - brings up all of this stuff which is
1074:18 - super cool
1074:20 - all right
1074:21 - so that's good
1074:25 - and I can even click choose file and
1074:27 - click an image and it automatically
1074:30 - knows Disney plus ASMR right it says it
1074:33 - right there so that's a really good sign
1074:34 - so like things are already kind of
1074:36 - working
1074:38 - I'm gonna say accept
1074:41 - um and let's say
1074:44 - accept what except
1074:47 - uh image slash GIF so accept images and
1074:52 - GIFs
1074:53 - and also
1074:55 - um accept
1074:57 - jpegs
1075:00 - and also I'll have it except pngs
1075:05 - okay like this
1075:07 - so that's good
1075:10 - your name is equal to image
1075:14 - the ID of this will be file
1075:18 - cool of this input
1075:21 - and then let's give it a style and I'll
1075:23 - give it a
1075:25 - jsx inline styling okay and I'm going to
1075:28 - say display
1075:32 - um none
1075:34 - okay
1075:35 - so if I remove that style you see choose
1075:39 - file if I re if I add display none now
1075:43 - that choose file is just not showing
1075:45 - because I I said don't display it right
1075:47 - if I change it with something else it's
1075:49 - going to have different Behavior
1075:51 - cool all right
1075:54 - so that's good now on change we need to
1075:58 - add something that actually handles on
1076:01 - change okay so let's go
1076:04 - on change
1076:06 - we're going to handle on change
1076:09 - okay so it's going to run our handle
1076:10 - change function we're just going to do
1076:13 - all of this which is going to set the
1076:15 - image for us
1076:17 - cool
1076:18 - cool
1076:22 - let's so now we're closing out of that
1076:25 - input that's good
1076:27 - all right so that input should end right
1076:30 - there right underneath that will add a
1076:32 - paragraph tag and in here let's add a
1076:37 - label
1076:39 - okay and html4 will just be file
1076:42 - [Music]
1076:44 - and now let's give it a style
1076:47 - okay again we'll also do this one inline
1076:50 - as well for styling just please bear
1076:53 - with me this is going to be a little
1076:54 - hard to follow but
1076:56 - bear with me here and I'm just going to
1076:58 - say cursor pointer but actually you know
1077:00 - what I don't even think we need that to
1077:02 - be honest I'm just gonna leave that
1077:04 - so that will make it simpler for you
1077:07 - and then let's just say inside of the
1077:10 - label
1077:10 - let's just say
1077:14 - select
1077:16 - a image Let's do an image to share like
1077:21 - that
1077:22 - okay so now there is our styling
1077:24 - very very simple
1077:26 - okay and when I click it
1077:28 - okay already
1077:31 - um it actually opens this up okay so but
1077:34 - what we have to do is probably make it
1077:36 - look like something that you want to
1077:37 - click on
1077:39 - so we're gonna do that in just a second
1077:42 - all right let's end our label we're
1077:45 - ending our label that's good and right
1077:47 - underneath ending our label we're ending
1077:49 - our P tag that's good
1077:52 - now let's right underneath our P tag but
1077:55 - it's still inside our upload image
1077:57 - component let's add in these squigglies
1078:01 - and we're gonna do share image so if the
1078:04 - image actually exists then do the
1078:07 - following
1078:09 - okay I'm gonna say image source is equal
1078:14 - to
1078:16 - and I'm going to say url.create
1078:19 - object
1078:21 - URL
1078:22 - and I'm going to pass this
1078:26 - the share image path
1078:29 - okay like that
1078:31 - let's close our image tag
1078:35 - beautiful
1078:37 - okay boom
1078:39 - boom
1078:41 - hey our image is showing that was nice
1078:45 - and a lot easier to do than expected
1078:48 - beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful
1078:50 - beautiful that's good
1078:52 - let's go down upload image
1078:56 - now let's add this component styling all
1078:58 - the way at the bottom for upload image
1079:00 - because right now the image is
1079:01 - ridiculous right so we're just going to
1079:03 - need to control that so let's go text
1079:05 - align
1079:06 - Center and then after this so now select
1079:09 - an image to share is looking good
1079:12 - okay and of course now what we want to
1079:15 - do is we're going to say hey the image
1079:17 - let's give it a width of a hundred
1079:19 - percent
1079:21 - one of those
1079:22 - so now the image is looking great wow
1079:26 - how nice huh we got click
1079:31 - okay let's refresh
1079:33 - right boom let's click select an image
1079:37 - to share
1079:38 - pick that hit enter
1079:40 - man that looks beautiful that looks
1079:43 - beautiful I love it okay very very
1079:45 - simple
1079:46 - and very effective very very effective
1079:51 - um now we're also gonna add a react
1079:54 - player so then that way we're able to
1079:57 - actually show like any video URLs that
1080:00 - we put okay that's gonna like kind of
1080:03 - Auto expand them and make them look
1080:05 - great so let's go ahead and do that
1080:07 - cool so let's start working on it now
1080:09 - first things we need is we actually I'm
1080:11 - going to hit Ctrl C and stop my server
1080:13 - and what we actually need is you can do
1080:15 - npm install
1080:17 - like this but I'm actually going to do
1080:19 - yarn add which is the same thing uh and
1080:23 - I'm gonna do yarn add react dash player
1080:26 - okay and hit enter so install
1080:29 - um what I want you to do is install this
1080:31 - component right now not component but uh
1080:34 - man my brain is getting fried
1080:36 - but yeah install this so now you should
1080:38 - have react player
1080:40 - okay the react player Library
1080:42 - and let's go inside of our post model
1080:45 - and go all the way at the top and I'm
1080:46 - going to do import react player from
1080:51 - react player like this cool and right
1080:55 - underneath here we're going to say const
1080:59 - video link and then we're going to say
1081:01 - set video link like this equal use State
1081:05 - and leave that blank okay
1081:08 - cool
1081:10 - now
1081:11 - inside of our handle change
1081:15 - actually are we going to work on inside
1081:17 - of our handle change
1081:19 - let me see okay so right here where I'm
1081:23 - doing this share image thing right above
1081:25 - upload image
1081:27 - um
1081:29 - where should we add this actually let me
1081:32 - think so let's keep this inside of our
1081:35 - upload image but right underneath where
1081:37 - we're doing the share image line okay so
1081:41 - right here
1081:42 - or we're gonna do a couple of things I'm
1081:44 - going to add a empty react jss jsx
1081:49 - fragment
1081:51 - okay and inside of this let's add an
1081:55 - input
1081:56 - uh we're gonna keep it text and
1082:00 - placeholder will be please input a video
1082:04 - link like that
1082:08 - and then the value will be whatever is
1082:11 - the video link that
1082:13 - we give it and of course on change we're
1082:16 - gonna say
1082:20 - take the event
1082:22 - and set the video URL set the video link
1082:26 - based on whatever the user gives you
1082:28 - okay the value of the event
1082:32 - great
1082:33 - so input ends here
1082:38 - and right underneath input what we're
1082:40 - going to do is open close squiggly
1082:43 - and I'm going to say if video link
1082:45 - exists
1082:47 - then what I want you to do
1082:49 - okay and let's close this bracket and go
1082:52 - react player
1082:56 - all right and I just imported it so I
1082:59 - imported import react player from react
1083:01 - dash player so make sure you go ahead
1083:03 - and do that let's say react player with
1083:06 - is equal to
1083:09 - 10
1083:10 - uh let's go 100 percent
1083:13 - okay
1083:14 - and then we're gonna go URL
1083:18 - and is whichever video link that's
1083:20 - actually set in our state at the moment
1083:23 - okay save
1083:25 - beautiful
1083:28 - so that should be pretty good
1083:30 - all right now we're gonna test it out
1083:33 - and see if it if it does anything
1083:37 - whoops let's do yarn start again so it
1083:40 - starts up our app
1083:42 - okay wake up app cool
1083:45 - all right so we got please input a video
1083:47 - link let's see if I have a YouTube video
1083:50 - link
1083:51 - boom right when I embed it it's right
1083:54 - there that is awesome and this also
1083:56 - happens to be my video if you want to go
1083:57 - check out my chess Channel welcome
1084:01 - that's awesome yeah
1084:03 - beautiful
1084:06 - let's go 20 on the width so that made it
1084:09 - really really tiny just like this
1084:11 - so make sure choose 100 on your react
1084:14 - player width so react player plays
1084:16 - really nicely with videos
1084:18 - okay so we're good now we're gonna make
1084:22 - it so you can switch between share image
1084:24 - or share video all right here we go
1084:28 - welcome back to the same thing that you
1084:32 - were on so let's just continue going all
1084:34 - right I just want to take a little break
1084:35 - but it's all good we're back now and
1084:38 - we're ready to go okay can I hear myself
1084:40 - beautiful awesome so let's just go ahead
1084:44 - and get started with this right so so
1084:45 - far we're doing a great job we got the
1084:48 - video players showing we got me looking
1084:51 - beautiful here right there okay maybe
1084:53 - for you it's your video that you're
1084:55 - putting okay you can use your own
1084:57 - YouTube video link and then it'll be you
1084:59 - with that said let's go ahead and make
1085:02 - it so we can switch between whichever
1085:04 - one we want right because right now
1085:07 - we're seeing both image and the YouTube
1085:10 - url I don't want to see both of them I
1085:12 - just want to see one of them okay cool
1085:14 - so let's go ahead and add that
1085:16 - functionality okay now the functionality
1085:18 - is going to take a little bit
1085:20 - so first things first we're going to
1085:21 - start off by going inside of our post
1085:24 - model so make sure you're there and
1085:26 - right here we're going to add that
1085:28 - component okay so not component we're
1085:31 - going to add
1085:32 - a state variable here okay because this
1085:35 - is going to change at some point so
1085:37 - asset area and then of course the um the
1085:40 - way that we are using it is going to be
1085:42 - set asset area cool just like this is a
1085:45 - convention we use and default is going
1085:48 - to be empty cool now let's go under
1085:52 - where we have set chair image okay
1085:55 - underneath that we're going to make a
1085:58 - new function here that we're going to
1086:00 - use switch asset area
1086:03 - cool
1086:04 - it'll take in the area as an argument
1086:07 - and then it's going to do a couple of
1086:09 - things
1086:10 - so it's going to make the
1086:13 - image just empty we'll also do set video
1086:17 - link and we'll make that empty cool and
1086:21 - then we're going to do set asset area
1086:25 - to the area that we received okay
1086:29 - and uh that's all good okay
1086:33 - awesome now let's go to our reset in in
1086:37 - our reset we're just going to add a few
1086:39 - more things okay but we're gonna add
1086:41 - that above our handle Click Change okay
1086:45 - so I'm gonna do set share image let's go
1086:49 - blank here set video link will go blank
1086:52 - because again this is reset so this
1086:54 - should reset essentially all of those
1086:57 - States so that's what all we're doing
1086:58 - there
1086:59 - now let's go down under where we have
1087:02 - the area focus in our text area Okay so
1087:07 - right below this
1087:09 - I'm gonna do a couple of things
1087:12 - okay what I'm going to do is let's open
1087:14 - up our squiggly bracket here okay
1087:19 - and um let's go ahead let's go ahead and
1087:24 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
1087:26 - close the squiggly bracket kind of in
1087:28 - this weird area right underneath this
1087:30 - jsx the jsx fragment that's ending right
1087:33 - underneath this uh
1087:35 - player that's where I'm going to add the
1087:39 - ending of that
1087:40 - okay
1087:41 - and essentially we're going to have a
1087:44 - ternary operator in between there so
1087:47 - let's do this okay so if asset area is
1087:50 - equal to image then I want the following
1087:54 - to happen all right whoops image then I
1087:58 - want
1087:59 - this all of this to happen
1088:02 - okay the upload image thing to show up
1088:07 - okay
1088:09 - um
1088:09 - all right guys so I'm gonna take this
1088:12 - where this upload image is ending
1088:15 - I'm gonna take it okay I'm gonna take
1088:18 - this thing here and let's move it up
1088:20 - okay
1088:22 - so boom boom boom let's go up top and uh
1088:27 - let's end this component right here okay
1088:30 - the upload image component
1088:32 - and here's where I'm going to add my
1088:35 - ternary so I'm going to do colon here
1088:37 - this is a little hard to read
1088:40 - and um and I apologize about that but
1088:42 - bear with me here and then I'm gonna say
1088:45 - if the asset area is Media then I want
1088:49 - you to do the following
1088:51 - okay in that case do all of this so
1088:55 - again a little hard to read but I'm
1088:58 - basically saying if it's image then do
1089:01 - all of this okay the upload image
1089:03 - component
1089:04 - okay if the asset area is Media then do
1089:08 - all of this okay great and then let's go
1089:12 - ahead and just switch a couple of things
1089:14 - so I'm going to find my asset button and
1089:16 - all I'm gonna do for my asset button is
1089:19 - very simple I will
1089:22 - simply add an on click on this thing
1089:24 - like this
1089:26 - let's open this up go like that
1089:29 - beautiful and I'm going to do switch
1089:30 - asset area like so and uh pass in image
1089:36 - okay give it pass in the image for that
1089:39 - and then where's my other asset button
1089:41 - right here this is the one for the video
1089:44 - and I'm just gonna say on click
1089:47 - and we're going to do switch asset area
1089:52 - and I'm just going to say media like so
1089:55 - okay
1089:56 - and then that should be pretty freaking
1089:58 - good great
1090:00 - pretty freaking cool wow
1090:03 - look at that it's working and it looks
1090:05 - nice right when I click the image I see
1090:07 - this when I click this one I see this
1090:10 - video right there okay and how is that
1090:12 - working well uh this is
1090:15 - this is uh one asset button which is
1090:18 - right here and this asset button number
1090:21 - two this video one okay so we got one
1090:25 - and two
1090:26 - I'll write one and two just like so
1090:29 - okay this image one is this one the one
1090:32 - and this media one is this video one now
1090:35 - what happens when I click this video one
1090:39 - or sorry this picture one is this on
1090:42 - click
1090:43 - thing runs and
1090:46 - it changes my estate variable this asset
1090:49 - area one and it changes it to image okay
1090:52 - so well let's go into that function and
1090:54 - see what that's doing okay
1090:56 - it changes it to an image okay so I go
1091:00 - switch asset area and I pass it the
1091:02 - image and then it just changes it to an
1091:05 - image all right and that makes the code
1091:09 - appear and work and do do essentially
1091:12 - what I wanted to do okay if I go and do
1091:15 - switch asset area to Media it goes ahead
1091:19 - and changes it to a media okay and then
1091:21 - boom you get your switching statements
1091:24 - here boom and here I can put my video
1091:27 - link to a YouTube video like so and it
1091:30 - will actually even put the video here
1091:33 - okay and let's test putting an image and
1091:36 - let's see if our image works
1091:37 - beautiful our image is working and
1091:40 - that's exactly what we want so we're
1091:43 - done with that functionality now we're
1091:45 - going to connect with our store and uh
1091:47 - get user info okay so let's go down
1091:51 - first of all let's actually just import
1091:53 - so I'm going to do import connect
1091:55 - because we're going to need to connect
1091:57 - to our Redux store in a second
1091:59 - so let's do this okay
1092:02 - all right so now we're going to map
1092:04 - states to props the boring usual Redux
1092:07 - stuff which you know the Redux toolkit
1092:10 - you don't need to know how to do and do
1092:13 - map state to props state
1092:16 - and um actually this is going to be an
1092:19 - expression like that
1092:22 - okay let's leave it empty for now
1092:24 - and I'm just going to do export default
1092:28 - connect map state to props we'll do map
1092:32 - dispatch
1092:35 - uh dispatch to props okay and then we'll
1092:39 - do Post modal
1092:42 - like that actually my bad okay uh this
1092:46 - is this one is going to be map dispatch
1092:48 - map
1092:50 - dispatch to props okay and uh that's
1092:56 - going to be good for the dispatch to
1092:58 - prompts and above this I'm going to add
1093:01 - map state to props
1093:04 - okay and we'll make this state now this
1093:07 - one is going to be dispatch
1093:10 - okay so this one that says state
1093:14 - cool let's go like this
1093:16 - all right I like putting parentheses
1093:19 - here hopefully prettier likes it too
1093:21 - great
1093:22 - and what I'm going to do is say return
1093:25 - user State user state DOT State like
1093:29 - that okay so now that should be good to
1093:32 - go
1093:33 - that's that all right now we're going to
1093:35 - display the user info
1093:38 - so let's go to user info component which
1093:41 - is up here and we're going to add our
1093:44 - little ternary action
1093:46 - and let's go ahead and do that
1093:50 - now okay
1093:53 - so I'm going to say
1093:55 - props.user.photo URL so hey if the photo
1093:58 - URL is there then I want you to do the
1094:02 - following then I want you to show the
1094:04 - image and the source for this is going
1094:07 - to be
1094:09 - the actual URL for the photo
1094:12 - props.user.photo URL like so all right
1094:16 - and I don't need to do anything else I
1094:20 - think that should be good cool let's end
1094:23 - this
1094:24 - photo one
1094:26 - okay and then we need an or statement so
1094:29 - an or statement
1094:30 - I'm going to basically give it this as
1094:34 - my or statement and then we need to end
1094:36 - this squiggly
1094:39 - okay
1094:40 - so what is my error here let's see
1094:45 - I think I'm ending it too early so let's
1094:47 - remove that
1094:48 - there
1094:50 - so basically I'm saying hey does the
1094:52 - photo exist if it exists if the user
1094:55 - then showed the photo of the actual user
1094:58 - that we pulled from Firebase otherwise
1094:59 - showed us Anonymous user photo so let's
1095:02 - click the post modal
1095:05 - okay now it's having an error cannot
1095:07 - read property photo URL of undefined
1095:09 - okay no problem
1095:12 - um
1095:13 - so what basically needs to happen is I
1095:16 - need to right now actually I'm logged in
1095:19 - logged in
1095:21 - okay weird error we'll figure it out
1095:24 - together
1095:25 - not to worry
1095:27 - okay let's hit save on this thing and
1095:29 - then let's go ahead underneath here we
1095:32 - got our span tag in our span what I'm
1095:35 - going to say is props.user that display
1095:39 - name okay just like that
1095:45 - great
1095:48 - and of course we gotta close our
1095:51 - squiggly
1095:52 - otherwise we're going to be in some
1095:54 - troubles
1095:57 - cool so let's try signing out let's try
1096:00 - signing in with Google
1096:05 - okay
1096:06 - cannot read property photo URL of
1096:09 - undefined
1096:11 - interesting
1096:13 - because pretty sure we're freaking
1096:15 - logged in
1096:16 - oh duh this is why I don't have access
1096:20 - to the user
1096:23 - I gotta access the freaking user okay
1096:26 - that's what user is okay State at
1096:30 - usersate.user okay so now up here
1096:36 - where I'm asking for the user command F
1096:39 - user
1096:42 - okay where I want to get the user's
1096:44 - photo now I have access to the user's
1096:47 - photo so let's hit save let's hit
1096:49 - refresh
1096:51 - and now I'm going to have access to the
1096:52 - user's photo okay so for example let's
1096:54 - Click Boom there we go okay so now let's
1096:58 - go full screen here
1097:01 - Okay click Start a post and if you're
1097:03 - logged in we'll have a photo here if
1097:05 - you're not logged in you shouldn't even
1097:07 - be able to get to this page but if you
1097:09 - did get to this page you'll have this
1097:10 - Anonymous photo as a fallback okay
1097:13 - so great now we got that photo now let's
1097:17 - add functionality with the image okay we
1097:19 - want to be able to actually upload the
1097:21 - image to Firebase storage so let's go
1097:23 - ahead and do that now
1097:25 - so first things first well what are the
1097:29 - first things first so let's go to
1097:32 - actions because we're going to add an
1097:34 - action and we're going to add a new
1097:37 - action
1097:38 - again it's going to be called Post
1097:40 - article API and it will take in a
1097:43 - payload okay
1097:46 - and I'm just going to return a dispatch
1097:48 - event
1097:50 - that's going to look like the following
1097:52 - okay
1097:53 - if what I want to do is payload is
1097:57 - payload dot image is not blank
1098:00 - so we have an image
1098:03 - then I'm going to set my upload to be
1098:06 - storage
1098:08 - dot ref whoops storage dot ref
1098:12 - okay
1098:14 - Images slash
1098:18 - payloadimage.name
1098:20 - okay
1098:23 - and then let's get out of here and we're
1098:26 - going to use the dot put method
1098:29 - and we'll do payload dot image
1098:34 - cool so this is going to help us upload
1098:38 - our image
1098:40 - all right
1098:41 - and uh let's go ahead and make sure that
1098:44 - we do that
1098:46 - all right now let's do
1098:50 - upload
1098:51 - okay and I'll do upload dot on
1098:55 - cool
1098:56 - on state changed
1099:01 - okay
1099:02 - then we're going to do snapshot
1099:07 - all right let's go and
1099:11 - not that one let's go like that snapshot
1099:14 - I'm going to say const progress is the
1099:18 - following
1099:20 - I'm gonna have snapshot bytes
1099:24 - transferred
1099:28 - boom
1099:29 - and we'll do snapshot dot total bytes
1099:34 - bytes just like that
1099:36 - all right and let's multiply that by a
1099:39 - hundred and close it off
1099:42 - cool
1099:45 - all right
1099:47 - now this is going to be helpful for
1099:49 - making that loading bar soon and you
1099:52 - guys will see how this is actually going
1099:53 - to help you
1099:54 - okay so now boom
1099:58 - we have this one right here
1100:01 - let's just wrap this thing inside of
1100:05 - parens right here
1100:09 - um it doesn't need it okay it's
1100:10 - redundant cool
1100:13 - let's get out of here and now let's
1100:16 - basically go console log
1100:18 - uh progress
1100:23 - okay and I'll do this
1100:28 - progress
1100:31 - okay and we'll put a percent sign
1100:34 - so they'll show us
1100:36 - how's our progress doing so far
1100:39 - I don't want my function to be ending
1100:43 - here
1100:45 - so this upload on
1100:48 - needed to be ending a little bit later
1100:52 - all right so we're gonna need quite a
1100:54 - lot of little weird changes here so just
1100:57 - follow along
1100:59 - um gets messy Okay so
1101:02 - open the parenthesis here and we're
1101:05 - going to close this okay because this
1101:06 - whole thing is an expression
1101:09 - then I'm going to console log the
1101:10 - progress and then what I want to do is I
1101:13 - want to essentially close out everything
1101:15 - right so for example this squiggly here
1101:17 - let's close that out
1101:20 - that parentheses right there I'm going
1101:22 - to close that out
1101:24 - I also want to close this squiggly right
1101:27 - there
1101:28 - okay and then I also want to close that
1101:31 - quickly out right there and I also want
1101:33 - to close that squiggly out right there
1101:36 - and that should effectively take care of
1101:39 - everything and once I hit save
1101:41 - it should kind of format it like this
1101:43 - okay but there's a couple of things that
1101:46 - we got to do here all right now
1101:48 - underneath this
1101:50 - what I want to basically say is if the
1101:53 - snapshot
1101:54 - state is running on the other hand
1101:58 - okay
1102:00 - then what I want to do is I want to
1102:02 - console log
1102:04 - the progress
1102:07 - okay progress like this
1102:12 - and
1102:13 - boom
1102:17 - cool so in both cases kind of show me
1102:21 - show me what's going on
1102:24 - okay
1102:25 - and then let's go underneath here
1102:29 - okay right there
1102:32 - and what I will say is if there's an
1102:34 - error then console.log error
1102:38 - code
1102:43 - okay
1102:45 - so
1102:47 - again I know there's a lot going on in
1102:49 - this upload so
1102:52 - there there's a lot right so for example
1102:54 - this upload function
1102:56 - it took in the state change then it took
1103:00 - in this function right here on the Fly
1103:02 - and then it's also taking in uh what
1103:05 - needs to happen when there's an error
1103:08 - okay
1103:13 - cool
1103:14 - and then let's also do async
1103:20 - okay we're gonna have download URL and
1103:23 - what that's going to do is we're going
1103:25 - to wait upload
1103:30 - cool
1103:31 - and we're going to do get download URL
1103:34 - like so
1103:36 - okay
1103:38 - all right so storage is not defined we
1103:41 - will Define storage by importing it okay
1103:44 - so let's go ahead up at the top and in
1103:47 - here right after provider I'm going to
1103:49 - upload storage from Firebase
1103:52 - that'll take care of that we also want
1103:54 - to add our database let's do import DB
1103:56 - from
1103:58 - Firebase we're going to need that later
1104:02 - okay
1104:04 - cool let's come on down now and we got
1104:07 - our download URL so that's good now we
1104:11 - need to do a couple of things so right
1104:13 - underneath this download URL we're gonna
1104:16 - do our DB collection okay so DB
1104:19 - collection
1104:21 - articles to the Articles collection
1104:24 - we're going to add the following the
1104:28 - actor
1104:29 - it's going to have the following things
1104:31 - in here description will be payload of
1104:34 - the user email
1104:38 - title
1104:39 - will beep
1104:42 - display name like so
1104:45 - date will be whatever is the time stamp
1104:48 - of the payload
1104:50 - and then image will be
1104:53 - the photo URL of course
1104:56 - okay
1104:58 - great
1105:00 - and then underneath Here video will be
1105:02 - payload video
1105:05 - shared image will be the download URL
1105:10 - that we made comments will be zeroable
1105:13 - kind of just hard code that for now and
1105:15 - description will be the payload
1105:18 - description
1105:21 - okay so that should be good I know that
1105:25 - that was like a pretty hefty piece of
1105:28 - code but let's go to our post model and
1105:30 - now actually add that functionality and
1105:33 - we're pretty close
1105:34 - so hang in there with me guys let's
1105:37 - import Firebase from
1105:39 - Firebase
1105:42 - okay and then we're going to import our
1105:46 - Post article
1105:48 - API like so
1105:51 - and let's do from dot dot actions
1105:56 - okay
1105:58 - so that gets us that now let's go where
1106:01 - our switch asset area shows up
1106:06 - cool
1106:08 - and let's add in our new method okay our
1106:13 - function here pulse article
1106:17 - okay it's going to take an event
1106:20 - and again I want to kind of prevent um
1106:24 - any of the weird stuff happening in
1106:26 - react where things need to refresh and
1106:28 - so on so let's take care of that and I'm
1106:31 - basically going to say if the target
1106:33 - does not equal to the current Target
1106:36 - then just return
1106:41 - cool
1106:43 - and then I'm gonna Define our payload
1106:46 - and image will be the share image
1106:50 - video will be the video link
1106:55 - our user will be our actual
1106:59 - user
1107:01 - description
1107:04 - description will be whatever the text is
1107:09 - that the user adds and of course
1107:11 - timestamp will be
1107:14 - Firebase timestamp
1107:19 - okay
1107:20 - so that's why we imported Firebase and
1107:24 - then
1107:25 - here we're going to have props Dot
1107:29 - Post article
1107:31 - that's going to take the payload
1107:34 - okay and then simply let's go ahead and
1107:36 - reset
1107:38 - e and then we'll call this function and
1107:40 - we'll reset everything okay once it's
1107:43 - added and now let's basically go ahead
1107:45 - and add these buttons
1107:47 - so I'm gonna go down to my post button
1107:52 - and inside of my post button
1107:57 - when I click that button
1108:00 - I want a couple of things to happen
1108:03 - okay so let's go here and we'll Define
1108:06 - an on click
1108:11 - just leave it blank for a second and in
1108:14 - our on click what I want to happen is
1108:17 - I'm going to give it an event
1108:20 - and then I want the following things to
1108:22 - occur
1108:27 - run our Post article function and give
1108:30 - it the event details okay
1108:33 - that means the description the text any
1108:36 - information that we have already about
1108:38 - the user and now just let's go to our
1108:41 - dispatch
1108:43 - and add all of that in
1108:45 - cool so let's go here
1108:47 - and let's add in that so Post article
1108:52 - and we will do it'll take in a payload
1108:56 - okay and then we'll dispatch
1108:58 - Post article API
1109:03 - payload like that
1109:07 - okay beautiful now
1109:10 - let's see if it actually does anything
1109:12 - for now so I will take in an image
1109:15 - select an image click an image do that
1109:21 - test let's hit post
1109:24 - post so maybe it's doing something maybe
1109:28 - it isn't but the only way to go and
1109:31 - check is to go inside of our firestore
1109:33 - database and let's see if anything is
1109:36 - actually happening
1109:38 - okay so let's go ahead and create a
1109:40 - database I'll put it in test mode let's
1109:42 - hit next
1109:44 - and enable
1109:48 - all right that's going to be important
1109:49 - because that allows our database to
1109:51 - actually be created in the first place
1109:53 - otherwise we will not have a database
1109:55 - and firestore is actually very very
1109:58 - powerful
1110:00 - so I like using this as our database
1110:03 - okay
1110:06 - all right now we don't have any
1110:08 - collections or anything like that
1110:11 - so let's try hitting post again
1110:14 - does that do anything
1110:17 - nope not doing anything right now which
1110:21 - is totally fine
1110:23 - and by the way firestore also has
1110:26 - storage okay so I'm going to click on
1110:28 - that I'm gonna go in there so on the
1110:30 - left hand side I have storage and I can
1110:33 - even upload a file right so let's just
1110:34 - click here upload a file see what
1110:36 - happens I'm just kind of like hard
1110:37 - coding and uploading it there okay so
1110:39 - boom it uploaded it and now we'll be
1110:42 - able to retrieve file from here okay so
1110:44 - that's the file data
1110:47 - it's kind of nice GUI that they have
1110:49 - actually for uploading uh things so
1110:52 - pretty uh simple but that's just kind of
1110:55 - like on me hard coding it okay but
1110:57 - that's not the way we're going to do
1110:58 - what we're going to do in our app
1111:01 - oh and going back to index file by the
1111:04 - way and our actions index.js
1111:08 - um this is squiggly okay
1111:12 - not parentheses that's why it's not
1111:14 - changing uh
1111:16 - that's why it's actually not using that
1111:18 - variable okay this is like template
1111:20 - literals so that's how they work but
1111:23 - almost refresh
1111:25 - cool
1111:27 - okay let's try uploading the image now
1111:30 - hopefully that works Let's test test
1111:33 - test test test
1111:36 - okay
1111:37 - if it works it'll probably upload it to
1111:40 - our storage folder inside of our
1111:42 - Firebase okay so let's keep on trying
1111:45 - this thing
1111:46 - all right so let's actually debug this
1111:49 - real quick together because I think
1111:50 - that's going to be helpful so let's go
1111:52 - inside of Post article and I'm going to
1111:54 - type in console log
1111:56 - uh post Malone
1112:00 - all right let's uh add a rocket here
1112:04 - okay it's not gonna add a rocket so
1112:07 - let's just add a person here that's fine
1112:09 - all right so I have my image I'm going
1112:11 - to hit post and it says post Malone
1112:15 - so I want to see where it's getting to
1112:16 - so it's getting to this line let's now
1112:19 - add a console log here and I'm just
1112:21 - going to say
1112:22 - and can I add add a cake here let's add
1112:25 - that cake
1112:26 - I don't know why it's uh being funny but
1112:28 - I'm just gonna say hello here okay and
1112:31 - let's see if it gets in here oh
1112:36 - ah okay so it seems like it's getting to
1112:40 - this if statement and then it's just
1112:42 - returning so it's actually not doing any
1112:44 - of this and it's not running this Post
1112:46 - article payload function because that
1112:49 - Post article payload actually does
1112:53 - everything that we need to do it
1112:54 - actually
1112:55 - does this Post article right we give it
1112:58 - the payload it dispatches it and then it
1113:00 - gives it to this function this function
1113:02 - knows how to upload so it's never even
1113:04 - getting to that it's just dying right
1113:06 - here
1113:08 - and that's because e.target is not equal
1113:10 - correct Target this should be car rent
1113:13 - Target okay so delete here
1113:18 - um and now it should not be getting to
1113:20 - that hello so let's try again and look
1113:22 - progress zero progress 28 progress 85
1113:26 - progress 100 wow so that actually looks
1113:29 - good looks like something happened so
1113:31 - I'm gonna go to my Firebase refresh is
1113:33 - it in my storage
1113:35 - or is it in my database oh it's in my
1113:38 - storage I oh that's cool I have an
1113:42 - images folder and here's my image Gatsby
1113:45 - versus next.js okay beautiful
1113:48 - it is all is it also in my database yes
1113:51 - it is I haven't collections here so I'm
1113:53 - going to delete this other uh record I
1113:55 - had
1113:57 - um actually let me just leave that I
1113:58 - just had like some dummy freaking record
1114:00 - okay so delete
1114:03 - um I don't know if it deletes the whole
1114:05 - thing or not it's not deleting it that's
1114:06 - fine so just forget about that one but
1114:09 - it just added this new record here in my
1114:11 - collection articles okay how do I know
1114:13 - that well if I go to my code inside of
1114:15 - my index.js I have this line here that
1114:18 - says hey
1114:20 - um DB collection articles inside of
1114:23 - Firebase add
1114:24 - and then add this whole thing
1114:27 - okay so we got
1114:29 - actor an actor has all these things
1114:31 - inside of it right
1114:34 - and then I also got just video shared
1114:38 - image and comments so video shared image
1114:41 - description of comments cool which is
1114:43 - corresponds to these four things
1114:45 - and then actor and all of that
1114:47 - corresponds to all of this okay so that
1114:53 - looks good to me so far now finally it's
1114:56 - working and this progress bar is working
1114:58 - so that's really good progress on our
1115:00 - end now let's add the same post
1115:03 - functionality but with video as well
1115:05 - okay and how we're gonna do that is it's
1115:08 - going to be very simple
1115:09 - so remember how we have this if
1115:11 - statement right here that says payload
1115:14 - image
1115:15 - well what we're going to do is say let's
1115:18 - find where that ends
1115:20 - right there okay and I'm just going to
1115:24 - do else if
1115:26 - be careful with the indentation
1115:27 - otherwise you're going to get caught
1115:29 - okay and I'm going to say if payload is
1115:31 - video then I'm going to do DB collection
1115:35 - and essentially I'm going to do the same
1115:36 - thing which is going to be articles
1115:38 - dot add
1115:40 - okay and we're going to do actor
1115:42 - description
1115:46 - payload.user.email
1115:50 - title
1115:51 - I'm just going to copy some of these
1115:53 - okay title is going to be
1115:57 - that
1115:58 - uh date is going to be whoops didn't
1116:01 - mean to delete it
1116:06 - okay so paste and then I'm going to copy
1116:11 - copy image and also paste it right here
1116:14 - okay so those are going to be the same
1116:17 - and also this whole thing pretty much is
1116:21 - also going to be the same video payload
1116:24 - video
1116:25 - shared image so the there's going to be
1116:28 - only one difference though okay so I'll
1116:30 - show you that in just a second let's hit
1116:32 - save now instead of shared image being
1116:34 - the download URL it's just going to be
1116:35 - empty because it's not an image
1116:38 - cool capiche makes sense
1116:41 - okay great
1116:44 - so that's it that's all that happens if
1116:47 - we choose to add a video instead of an
1116:50 - image okay so let's try adding let's go
1116:54 - here and refresh
1116:56 - and let's go here try adding a video
1117:00 - we'll add a YouTube video test hit post
1117:04 - and uh hopefully something happens
1117:10 - let's go to our app
1117:13 - did it add a video
1117:15 - yes it added a video right there
1117:18 - okay it's inside of our database we'll
1117:21 - be able to get access to it whenever we
1117:23 - want so on and so forth
1117:27 - okay cool now we're going to add in an
1117:31 - article reducer and this is going to be
1117:33 - helpful for when we actually want to
1117:34 - start pulling the Articles and actually
1117:36 - showing the Articles okay so let's go
1117:38 - ahead and start working on that so I'm
1117:41 - going to
1117:42 - go inside of my reducer so source
1117:48 - reducers going to my reducers folder and
1117:51 - we're going to create a new file and
1117:53 - it's going to be called article
1117:54 - reducer.js
1117:57 - AKA article updater okay much better
1118:00 - name for a reducer and I'm just going to
1118:03 - say export const in net State like this
1118:09 - loading is false okay so the initial
1118:12 - state is going to be loading is false so
1118:14 - we won't we shouldn't see that loading
1118:17 - Circle in the start
1118:20 - okay my article reducer
1118:23 - what that's going to be is hey my
1118:25 - initial state
1118:27 - let's make it the net state
1118:29 - and then it's going to take in an action
1118:31 - whoops my bad
1118:34 - there we go
1118:35 - and then we're going to take a switch
1118:38 - based on the action type that's just how
1118:40 - Redux works okay and again default is
1118:44 - going to be just returning the existing
1118:46 - state
1118:47 - and I'm going to export default article
1118:51 - reducer like so
1118:53 - now let's go inside of our index.js
1118:55 - which is inside of reducer so the re
1118:58 - index.js inside a reducer so go to that
1119:01 - and uh right underneath this user
1119:04 - reducer I'm going to add in an article
1119:06 - reducer
1119:11 - like that
1119:13 - and underneath my root reducer I'm going
1119:16 - to add so user state is good I'm just
1119:19 - going to add article state
1119:22 - and we will do article reducer
1119:25 - like so
1119:27 - all right so that's good now we're going
1119:30 - to start working on the loading bar okay
1119:33 - so we can see the loading bar uh showing
1119:36 - up as we
1119:39 - um
1119:39 - you know upload a video or an image we
1119:42 - want to see like a little spinning
1119:43 - circular loading bar
1119:46 - so let's start with going into our
1119:50 - action type.js inside of action so
1119:53 - action type.js
1119:55 - so this is going to be export con set
1119:58 - loading underscore status
1120:02 - equals set loading status like that
1120:08 - okay beautiful
1120:09 - [Music]
1120:11 - and let's go inside of our article
1120:14 - reducer
1120:16 - okay
1120:18 - and I'm gonna do one thing inside of my
1120:20 - article reducers which is I'm going to
1120:22 - add an import statement at the top and
1120:24 - I'm going to say import
1120:26 - set
1120:28 - set loading status
1120:32 - from
1120:35 - actions action type
1120:37 - okay
1120:38 - so let's import that one and then we're
1120:41 - going to do underneath our
1120:44 - action type let's go ahead and do that
1120:47 - so I'm going to say case
1120:50 - set loading status
1120:53 - okay
1120:54 - and I'm going to say a return whatever
1120:56 - the state previously was and then add
1120:58 - this new loading State on top of that
1121:01 - okay
1121:03 - keep in mind because this is Redux
1121:06 - nothing is being mutated
1121:07 - now let's go to our index not that index
1121:11 - let's go to our actions index.js there's
1121:15 - just so many indexes
1121:17 - okay so this import right here we're
1121:20 - going to do set user and also set
1121:22 - loading status
1121:25 - and let's go underneath our
1121:30 - um
1121:31 - I mean we can kind of add this wherever
1121:33 - we want but I'll just add it here
1121:37 - okay
1121:39 - let's let's just add it right there okay
1121:43 - and I'm gonna just do export constant
1121:49 - set loading is equal to it'll take in
1121:53 - status as an input
1121:56 - and we'll do type set loadings oops set
1122:01 - loading status
1122:04 - is going to be whatever the status we
1122:07 - pass it
1122:09 - okay and now let's go inside of our
1122:12 - function Post article API
1122:15 - and right underneath this return
1122:17 - dispatch I'm gonna say dispatch
1122:21 - set loading to be true
1122:27 - great let's give a little Gap here just
1122:30 - so it looks cleaner
1122:32 - great now let's go to our image and
1122:37 - our image if statement right go all the
1122:40 - way down to where we have the
1122:42 - payload.description
1122:44 - okay and right underneath that I'm going
1122:46 - to say dispatch set loading false
1122:51 - okay so once all of that happens we're
1122:54 - gonna say finish the loading meaning
1122:56 - we'll keep spinning keep spinning keep
1122:58 - spinning until the whole thing is
1123:00 - uploaded and added to our articles as
1123:03 - soon as it's added to our articles in
1123:06 - our Firebase database then stop the
1123:08 - spinning okay dispatch an action to our
1123:11 - Redux store change the state of the set
1123:14 - loading got it and then we're going to
1123:16 - do the same thing for the when the video
1123:19 - uh is done being uploaded so these are
1123:22 - the two parts where we're going to
1123:23 - switch the loading to
1123:25 - essentially false and for it to stop
1123:28 - spinning
1123:30 - okay
1123:33 - beautiful
1123:35 - now next up we're going to like add our
1123:39 - spinning logos and things like that okay
1123:41 - so here's the spending logo it's going
1123:43 - to be called spin loader this is what it
1123:45 - is okay spinloader.svg the it already
1123:48 - comes in with the graphic of the
1123:50 - spinning so we won't need to do any like
1123:52 - fancy CSS so that's a good thing
1123:55 - all right take it and add it to your
1123:57 - images and then we're going to x out of
1123:59 - it
1124:00 - okay
1124:02 - and now we're gonna go to main.js so we
1124:05 - can add that there okay so let's go to
1124:07 - where our share box is because it's
1124:09 - going to be inside of sharebox so inside
1124:12 - of sharebox we have
1124:14 - we don't need this text here by the way
1124:16 - any more share
1124:18 - let's hit refresh
1124:20 - cool so that share word is gone great
1124:24 - okay now I'm gonna add in a squiggly
1124:29 - here
1124:30 - okay and I'm gonna close this squiggly
1124:33 - uh where should I close this squiggly
1124:35 - I'll close it
1124:41 - let me think about where to close it
1124:44 - actually
1124:45 - so let's just close this squiggly right
1124:47 - underneath here okay and what I'm
1124:51 - basically gonna say is hey if the user
1124:54 - exists
1124:56 - then show the user photo like that
1125:01 - okay
1125:03 - and then here's what I want you to do if
1125:05 - the user photo URL exists then again
1125:10 - this is a ternary operator we're going
1125:13 - to do this
1125:17 - show me the actual users photo
1125:23 - end
1125:24 - okay
1125:26 - otherwise show me just an anonymous
1125:31 - photo
1125:36 - okay beautiful I'm gonna take that div
1125:40 - and uh let's put it right underneath the
1125:43 - share box okay just like that
1125:46 - so now what it should look like is we
1125:49 - have one div
1125:50 - inside of here
1125:53 - what happens is we either see the user's
1125:56 - image or we see the anonymous image and
1125:59 - then we have it button
1126:01 - okay so if I hit start a post
1126:04 - I see this
1126:06 - cool start a post
1126:09 - okay and then it uh when I click that
1126:12 - startup post button this thing is
1126:13 - treated like a button
1126:15 - and when I click it the handle click uh
1126:18 - function runs okay
1126:21 - so that little thing we added there is
1126:25 - helpful and awesome and now on this
1126:27 - button what we're going to do is we're
1126:29 - just going to add in what happens when
1126:31 - it is uh disabled okay so we're going to
1126:34 - do props out loading
1126:37 - okay and if so loading is either true
1126:41 - otherwise it's false okay so if it's
1126:43 - loading
1126:44 - set the disable to True otherwise set it
1126:47 - to false
1126:49 - so like we shouldn't be able to click
1126:51 - that thing or do anything to it if it's
1126:54 - a loading
1126:59 - cool let's go to where our content
1127:02 - component is
1127:05 - so let's find content
1127:09 - um actually we don't have content
1127:10 - component yet so let's go ahead and add
1127:13 - it and where I want to add it is
1127:17 - let's go to our share box right there
1127:20 - okay and right underneath my share box
1127:24 - I'm going to add this cool so let's do
1127:28 - this and I'm going to do props.loading
1127:32 - so if my loading is going on then
1127:36 - show my loading spinner
1127:39 - Images slash spin
1127:43 - loader.svg
1127:46 - okay
1127:48 - and I think we should be good even with
1127:50 - that
1127:54 - and let's end that image
1127:57 - that should be good
1127:59 - okay
1128:01 - so our content
1128:04 - um our content component is actually
1128:06 - going to be just a tad bit longer
1128:12 - so let's go ahead and remove this div
1128:16 - that we're wrapping article in and
1128:19 - instead we're going to wrap article
1128:21 - inside of content okay so I'm going to
1128:23 - remove
1128:25 - the um let's go ahead and remove that
1128:28 - div and let's
1128:30 - grab the ending of that content
1128:33 - and let's go all the way down to where
1128:35 - article ends
1128:38 - and let's remove this div as well and
1128:41 - paste content okay so instead of rap
1128:44 - ing our article in a div we're going to
1128:46 - wrap article in our content component
1128:49 - now again it's going to complain
1128:51 - it's gonna be like hey you haven't
1128:53 - defined content
1128:54 - okay no problem we're Pros now so we're
1128:58 - gonna go ahead and Define content I'm
1129:01 - gonna do style div
1129:04 - okay let's go up
1129:07 - boom in there and I'm gonna do text
1129:09 - align
1129:10 - Center
1129:12 - just like this
1129:14 - okay
1129:15 - and um let me go ahead
1129:20 - cool
1129:23 - okay let's do again this is for the
1129:26 - loading part okay I'm gonna do image
1129:30 - with 30 pixels
1129:34 - all right and then let's go
1129:37 - to the end here
1129:40 - all right and um
1129:42 - we're now gonna Define
1129:45 - what happens to our map State props so
1129:49 - map state to props
1129:56 - and we'll do a returned
1129:59 - loading state
1130:02 - articlestate.loading
1130:04 - and we'll also do what's going on with
1130:07 - the user so we'll get access to the user
1130:09 - state
1130:11 - and then let's do map dispatch
1130:15 - to props
1130:17 - okay and we'll just leave that blank for
1130:20 - now
1130:26 - like this
1130:33 - leave it blank
1130:38 - cool and let's do export default and
1130:41 - we'll do connect
1130:45 - map dispatch to props as well and of
1130:48 - course Main
1130:49 - that's this file that we're in now it's
1130:52 - like hey I don't know what connect is
1130:53 - okay don't worry it's not Connect Four
1130:56 - but it's importing connect from react
1131:01 - Redux like so
1131:04 - and that should know what we're trying
1131:06 - to do
1131:08 - so let's try to add an image and see
1131:10 - what happens now
1131:14 - we did not get a spinner
1131:21 - okay that was not fun
1131:24 - we definitely expected a spinner and
1131:27 - then we got like Rick Rolled
1131:40 - oh actually first of all let's go to
1131:42 - this part here we I don't need these uh
1131:47 - squigglies here first of all for the
1131:49 - loading so let's remove that
1131:52 - and uh let's try refreshing now
1131:57 - and giving it a good old College try
1131:59 - seeing if the spinner shows up
1132:03 - nope
1132:05 - okay and let's actually try putting a
1132:07 - period here real quick and do
1132:09 - period slash Images slash
1132:12 - spinloader.svg let's see if that helps
1132:16 - us out here
1132:20 - nope
1132:22 - okay I'm officially an idiot so I was
1132:25 - like wait what the frick is going on the
1132:27 - loading bar so loading bar is completely
1132:29 - working I just forgot that it
1132:32 - Works
1132:33 - um not to show the image because the
1132:35 - image pretty much just loads
1132:37 - instantaneously but this bar is actually
1132:41 - useful for when I hit post now the
1132:44 - loading bar shows so perfect
1132:47 - okay everything is working as expected
1132:50 - and we're making great progress this was
1132:53 - really awesome and fun so far so it
1132:55 - wasn't because I put a little period in
1132:58 - front of my um
1133:00 - uh
1133:02 - whatever that thing was uh the spinner
1133:04 - the spinner logo okay so anyways good
1133:08 - progress let's keep going now what we're
1133:10 - going to do is when the page is loading
1133:11 - we're gonna call the API using a use
1133:14 - effect and we're going to use that to
1133:17 - get actually the Articles from Firebase
1133:19 - okay so we're going to use react hooks
1133:21 - to get articles from Firebase so let's
1133:24 - go ahead and do that so I'm gonna go
1133:26 - into my index which is index.js inside
1133:29 - of my actions
1133:31 - okay
1133:33 - and uh let's go ahead and add a
1133:36 - completely new
1133:38 - function in here so I'm going to do
1133:40 - export function and do get articles
1133:44 - article pulse API okay
1133:48 - and then we're going to say return
1133:52 - dispatch like so
1133:56 - and we're going to say let
1133:58 - payload Okay so let's just leave payload
1134:02 - as is and I'm going to say DB dot
1134:04 - collection
1134:05 - I'll do articles and now we're going to
1134:08 - get data from the Articles okay so we're
1134:10 - gonna do order by
1134:13 - we're gonna do actor
1134:15 - dot date cool and we're going to do
1134:19 - descending like so
1134:22 - and uh then I'm gonna do on Snapshot
1134:29 - okay this allows me to read data from my
1134:32 - Firebase
1134:34 - I'm going to say payload is equal to
1134:36 - snapshot Dot docs.map
1134:40 - and all the documents that I pretty much
1134:43 - get back I'm essentially going to just
1134:46 - kind of put them in an array okay map
1134:49 - them that's what map will output that's
1134:51 - what payload will become and I'll
1134:53 - console the log payload as well so you
1134:56 - can kind of see it okay
1134:58 - cool now I have to refer to this and use
1135:02 - this inside of my main JS okay
1135:04 - so let's go to main
1135:06 - let's go import I'm gonna import use
1135:10 - effect so I can use it and I'm going to
1135:14 - bring use State because I will also need
1135:17 - State need to also manage State cool
1135:21 - let's do import the
1135:25 - get articles function as well that we
1135:28 - made inside of our actions
1135:30 - okay we're going to do
1135:32 - actions
1135:34 - dot dot slash actions just like that
1135:37 - great
1135:40 - and uh let's go ahead and just add that
1135:43 - uh
1135:44 - right here let's say use effect
1135:49 - cool
1135:52 - and props.get articles
1135:57 - okay so this will just pretty much run
1136:00 - it once
1136:02 - articles like this so essentially when I
1136:06 - go to main page uh we're gonna try to
1136:08 - run this once
1136:12 - let's go down all the way and now we're
1136:16 - gonna do our Redux stuff so let's go to
1136:18 - dispatch
1136:20 - data props
1136:23 - I'm gonna go inside of here let's do get
1136:25 - articles
1136:27 - and um
1136:30 - essentially going to say dispatch get
1136:32 - articles API like so and run it
1136:37 - run it run it run it
1136:39 - okay
1136:43 - okay let's see do I have an error here
1136:50 - use effect and use State what is it
1136:53 - complaining about
1136:57 - um oh I have uh I have it twice so that
1136:59 - can just be on one line that's fine
1137:01 - refresh
1137:03 - cannot read property collection of
1137:05 - undefined
1137:07 - okay great so let's hit inspect and see
1137:11 - if we're console logging anything we got
1137:14 - an array of four and uh this is perfect
1137:17 - because as you can see
1137:20 - this array of four is telling me
1137:25 - what do I have
1137:27 - okay so I have four items
1137:29 - okay one is um
1137:33 - this image right here the user image
1137:36 - one is this image right here
1137:40 - okay let me copy that string and paste
1137:43 - it
1137:44 - that image right there
1137:46 - cool
1137:47 - here's another one
1137:50 - it has a link to that video
1137:51 - [Music]
1137:53 - and then here's another one
1137:56 - okay
1137:58 - so shared image let's see where that
1138:00 - takes me
1138:01 - oh permission denied
1138:03 - okay all good
1138:07 - but it's looking like I have access to
1138:09 - all of this and I can actually read it
1138:14 - okay now what we're going to do is we're
1138:16 - going to dispatch an action to the store
1138:20 - um and uh for for setting articles okay
1138:23 - this will allow us to set articles and
1138:25 - then later we'll be able to do a lot
1138:27 - more things with them
1138:29 - all right cool so let's go ahead and do
1138:32 - that so I'm gonna go inside of my action
1138:34 - type and let's have another action type
1138:37 - export const get articles
1138:40 - and uh surprise surprise is going to be
1138:43 - called get articles
1138:45 - cool
1138:51 - now let's go inside of my main
1138:55 - and inside of my main where I'm defining
1138:58 - my
1138:59 - mapping state to props let's add
1139:02 - articles in here as well and I'm going
1139:04 - to say
1139:05 - state.article state
1139:08 - dot articles like this
1139:10 - cool
1139:13 - and uh let's go inside of my
1139:18 - article reducer okay if we don't have
1139:21 - one do we need to create one no we have
1139:23 - article reducer great
1139:25 - okay let's go to our initial State and
1139:28 - we're going to do a few things actually
1139:30 - although at the top so we're going to
1139:32 - import set loading status we're also
1139:34 - going to import get articles
1139:39 - okay underneath here I'm going to say
1139:41 - articles
1139:43 - and uh
1139:46 - whoops like this let's make articles uh
1139:49 - an empty array in the start
1139:53 - all right initial and now in our switch
1139:56 - cases
1139:58 - we're going to say hey if there's a case
1140:00 - of get articles
1140:04 - then what we need to do is return the
1140:07 - existing state
1140:09 - along with
1140:12 - whatever the Articles payload is
1140:21 - just like so
1140:23 - cool
1140:27 - and now let's go to index inside of our
1140:30 - actions
1140:34 - all right and in our index we are going
1140:37 - to import we have set user we have set
1140:40 - loading status
1140:42 - now let's go ahead and add get articles
1140:44 - and import this
1140:48 - and
1140:50 - let's go here and I'm going to do export
1140:53 - const get articles
1140:56 - payload
1141:01 - type get articles like that
1141:05 - payload will be payload
1141:09 - okay and let's go all the way down where
1141:12 - I'm like
1141:13 - sorting it by actor date and descending
1141:16 - order
1141:18 - all I'm going to do instead of this
1141:20 - console log we're going to dispatch this
1141:22 - I'm going to say get articles
1141:25 - payload
1141:27 - okay and I don't need this line anymore
1141:30 - so let's hit save on this thing
1141:33 - so we're done okay this is allowing us
1141:36 - to
1141:38 - set the articles
1141:41 - okay cool test
1141:45 - Mana just add a dummy image
1141:48 - not too much be happening right now
1141:51 - cool okay so everything is working
1141:55 - now what I want to do is I want to hide
1141:58 - the main content until there are
1142:01 - articles so we don't want to show any of
1142:04 - the content unless we have like articles
1142:06 - in there okay so like for example
1142:09 - if I don't have any articles then like
1142:11 - kind of don't show any of this the
1142:13 - content
1142:15 - cool so let's
1142:18 - we're inside of our main.js
1142:23 - let's go all the way up
1142:27 - let's go up right above the container
1142:31 - okay and right above the container I'm
1142:34 - going to open up a jsx fragment
1142:38 - and uh right underneath where does the
1142:41 - container end
1142:43 - so let's see where our container ends
1142:45 - under what where our container ends I'm
1142:48 - going to close off
1142:50 - my jsx fragment okay and here's another
1142:55 - thing I'm going to do I'm going to open
1142:56 - up a squiggly all the way at the top
1142:58 - right here
1143:00 - okay
1143:02 - and uh we're gonna close it all the way
1143:05 - at the bottom right before the jsx
1143:08 - fragment ending and hit save
1143:10 - okay
1143:12 - now while we're doing this is so we can
1143:14 - add our ternary operator so I'm going to
1143:16 - say if articles length is zero meaning
1143:20 - there's no articles then what I want you
1143:23 - to do is basically say they're
1143:28 - what the hell just happened
1143:30 - and there we go there are no articles
1143:34 - like that
1143:36 - okay that's all I want you to say
1143:39 - or
1143:41 - give me all of the things okay give me
1143:44 - the share box Give Me Everything
1143:51 - cool so this is a pretty simple ternary
1143:54 - operator but it's also pretty badass
1143:55 - because it's like
1143:58 - wait where did my ending squiggly go
1144:01 - it's also pretty badass it basically
1144:03 - says if there's zero then just show this
1144:06 - there are no articles and if there are
1144:08 - articles then do all of this okay kind
1144:14 - of crazy
1144:20 - cool
1144:24 - okay beautiful now we're gonna add the
1144:27 - loader
1144:28 - uh component
1144:36 - all right so a few things need to happen
1144:38 - so let's go and make the loader
1144:41 - component
1144:43 - all right
1144:57 - actually you know what let's actually
1144:59 - skip the loader component because I
1145:01 - think it's going to add a ton of
1145:02 - additional code and not that much
1145:05 - functionality so let's pass on that
1145:07 - honestly and instead what I want to do
1145:10 - is uh let's display the articles that we
1145:13 - actually get back from Firebase
1145:16 - okay I think that's going to be a lot
1145:19 - more uh interesting to add
1145:22 - cool so to get started on this we're
1145:25 - just going to do a few things inside of
1145:28 - our main JS let's go main.js cool I'm
1145:33 - there
1145:35 - um
1145:36 - let's go down to where I'm loading my
1145:39 - spinner
1145:45 - down down down okay so here's where my
1145:48 - spinner is happening
1145:51 - okay now right underneath this I'm going
1145:55 - to do a couple of things here
1146:05 - okay
1146:07 - so
1146:08 - buckle up because a lot is going to be
1146:11 - happening here so hang in there with me
1146:16 - let's go props dot articles
1146:21 - dot length
1146:24 - all right if it's greater than zero then
1146:26 - I want the following to happen
1146:30 - I want to map those articles
1146:35 - okay and I'm going to need the key
1146:38 - for performance sake
1146:45 - so I'm going to say hey article
1146:48 - key is equal to key like so
1146:59 - okay
1147:00 - and there's a lot of stuff that we're
1147:02 - going to be deleting soon as well
1147:04 - and it's going to make a ton of sense
1147:06 - shortly okay
1147:10 - so let's go articles.map
1147:13 - key
1147:16 - okay let's put a
1147:19 - bracket there
1147:25 - okay
1147:26 - and we're gonna need to end that article
1147:29 - at some point
1147:32 - but not to worry
1147:35 - let's actually do this okay so I'm gonna
1147:38 - remove
1147:41 - all of this here so we're just opening
1147:43 - this okay
1147:46 - and I'm just going to use this article
1147:48 - right here and let's give it a key
1147:54 - cool because like initially I was just
1147:56 - like showing one post but we're gonna
1147:57 - need to show multiple posts okay
1148:04 - so this whole thing is gonna end up
1148:07 - getting wrapped up
1148:09 - okay so we're gonna have to go all the
1148:11 - way down and wrap up this whole thing
1148:15 - so let's go all the way outside of
1148:18 - article
1148:20 - let's go ahead and
1148:25 - close it
1148:27 - okay
1148:28 - so hopefully the error should stop just
1148:30 - for a little bit
1148:31 - okay now we're going to make our changes
1148:35 - that we wanted to make okay so inside of
1148:38 - our a
1148:39 - um we're not just going to have this
1148:41 - hard-coded image of the user we're going
1148:43 - to have the image of the actual
1148:46 - uh
1148:47 - user okay so let's do article dot actor
1148:51 - dot image
1148:57 - okay so see now
1149:01 - it's cool because it has my image right
1149:03 - there
1149:05 - that's what we wanted it's pulling that
1149:07 - straight from Firebase that's a really
1149:10 - really good sign
1149:13 - so that's done the next thing is where
1149:16 - it says title
1149:18 - we're going to dynamically get this as
1149:20 - well so I'm going to say
1149:24 - article dot actor dot title like so
1149:29 - okay so now notice that my name is
1149:32 - coming through
1149:35 - that's also really good
1149:38 - let's do the same thing here article dot
1149:42 - actor
1149:45 - dot description
1149:52 - okay and now my email is showing up
1149:56 - and then I'm going to do article dot
1150:00 - actor
1150:01 - dot date and we're going to make it if I
1150:04 - leave it here let's see what it does
1150:08 - very interesting
1150:13 - let's see if it bugs out
1150:18 - it freaks out
1150:21 - okay and that's because we're getting a
1150:24 - weird date from Firebase so we're gonna
1150:26 - do that to date like that and let's see
1150:29 - if that fixes it
1150:31 - refresh
1150:39 - okay and if that doesn't fix it then
1150:41 - we're gonna do that to locale
1150:45 - date
1150:47 - string
1150:50 - okay hopefully that should fix it
1150:53 - and it does okay all we had to do was
1150:57 - change it and indeed it is April 24th
1151:00 - here Saturday 1 17 a.m so I'm grinding
1151:05 - out here 1 17 am for your beautiful face
1151:08 - so if you're happy about that and you
1151:11 - want to show your appreciation smash
1151:13 - that like button subscribe to the
1151:14 - channel
1151:15 - all right that's what I got for you
1151:19 - so that to me looks good
1151:22 - outside of this let's see what do we
1151:25 - need to change where it says description
1151:27 - let's change you know the description is
1151:30 - hard coded so let's change that with
1151:33 - article
1151:34 - dot description
1151:37 - like so
1151:40 - okay so test that's actually what I
1151:43 - wrote test test test test test
1151:46 - okay
1151:47 - let's see what happens if I write hello
1151:49 - and hit post
1151:51 - okay so right now those things are not
1151:54 - actually being added uh to the databases
1151:56 - and coming back we're not able to read
1151:58 - back from it so no worries okay because
1152:00 - it's still also sometimes waiting for an
1152:03 - image so a couple of things are
1152:04 - happening and while it's loading did you
1152:05 - notice I couldn't make a new post
1152:07 - so that was cool because it disables uh
1152:10 - the start a post button
1152:13 - so that's really cool functionality
1152:15 - underneath shared image we're gonna do
1152:20 - we're gonna do a couple of things
1152:23 - okay
1152:25 - side of shared image
1152:27 - should we leave this hard-coded image
1152:30 - probably
1152:33 - not
1152:34 - probably not
1152:37 - so we're going to get rid of it
1152:42 - okay why well because it's hard coded we
1152:45 - don't want it to be hard-coded we want
1152:47 - to work on it and change things
1152:49 - dynamically okay so here we go so I'm
1152:52 - going to say if
1152:53 - article shared image is not there and
1152:58 - article dot video
1153:02 - is there
1153:03 - then what I want you to do is use the
1153:06 - react player
1153:09 - all right so we're going to do react
1153:11 - player
1153:13 - and I'm going to give it a width of
1153:17 - 100 percent like that
1153:24 - okay and URL is going to be article dot
1153:28 - video like this
1153:31 - and let's close it
1153:36 - cool
1153:39 - all right so let's also import the react
1153:42 - player okay so let's go all the way to
1153:44 - the top I'm going to do import react
1153:48 - player from react
1153:51 - player
1153:55 - okay dope
1154:02 - cool
1154:04 - and uh now we'll add our or statement
1154:09 - and we're going to say or
1154:12 - do the following okay article dot shared
1154:16 - image if that's there
1154:19 - then do this image
1154:24 - article dot shared
1154:26 - image
1154:28 - and then just close it off
1154:34 - okay
1154:36 - so
1154:38 - open close
1154:43 - um
1154:48 - what's the problem here did I add a
1154:51 - question mark question mark
1155:00 - oh my bad
1155:01 - this should not be here
1155:06 - yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
1155:11 - because that's gonna end that whole
1155:13 - thing
1155:14 - okay
1155:17 - wow that looks great look at that
1155:23 - yeah buddy okay
1155:27 - so I like it I like it a lot
1155:31 - okay hover over this beautiful
1155:37 - that's absolutely absolutely great
1155:41 - all right now let's do articles comments
1155:45 - okay
1155:49 - so let's go down
1155:52 - town
1155:54 - right underneath so let's find our
1155:57 - social so we have our social accounts
1155:59 - ending uh here
1156:01 - and let's go a little bit above that
1156:05 - I have comments and my comments are
1156:07 - hard-coded in here I don't want it to be
1156:09 - hard-coded
1156:11 - so we're going to make them Dynamic and
1156:13 - I'm going to do article dot comments
1156:19 - all right zero
1156:23 - almost kind of like hard-coded but you
1156:26 - know not really
1156:28 - so that's good
1156:31 - okay great so this is looking good now
1156:35 - this is a lot of code
1156:38 - a lot a lot just this line is almost 400
1156:41 - lines of code I'll just file I mean
1156:45 - so great we have all of this showing up
1156:47 - exactly like how we want it that makes
1156:50 - me really happy
1156:52 - and then of course let's do
1156:55 - should we add more text now I don't
1156:58 - think I'm going to add this more text
1156:59 - functionality
1157:01 - okay
1157:02 - uh let's try now adding another post and
1157:06 - let's see if it actually reads
1157:09 - hey there uh we just got done
1157:14 - building
1157:17 - LinkedIn clone
1157:20 - with fire I would react.js Firebase
1157:26 - and Redux
1157:30 - for image
1157:33 - I don't know let me go and pick a cool
1157:35 - image so I'm gonna go inside of
1157:38 - thumbnails
1157:41 - and uh sure let's just pick uh
1157:47 - let's pick one of these
1157:51 - let's just pick this why not why not
1157:55 - let's hit post
1157:59 - look at that we just got done building
1158:03 - our LinkedIn clone with react.js
1158:05 - Firebase and Redux
1158:08 - so now our post functionality is
1158:11 - completely working exactly the way we
1158:14 - want it to that is absolutely gorgeous
1158:17 - all right and before we deploy this
1158:21 - thing because we're so freaking close
1158:24 - and I'm so proud of you that you've done
1158:26 - such a good job we just need to fix one
1158:28 - thing this over here looks funny and
1158:30 - these like buttons and these things look
1158:32 - funny so this is going to be
1158:35 - uh pretty simple so let's go inside of
1158:37 - our main.js and first let's fix social
1158:40 - accounts so social count component is
1158:42 - that one right there this one right here
1158:44 - okay so inside of our button let's try
1158:48 - going border none
1158:50 - so let's take away the border and uh
1158:52 - let's also do background color white
1158:56 - okay so just just matches the the rest
1158:59 - of the background
1159:01 - okay great so that looks good to me
1159:03 - let's also go inside of social actions
1159:06 - and we're going to do something similar
1159:07 - inside of our button let's go
1159:10 - um
1159:11 - let's go border none
1159:14 - okay great and let's go background color
1159:18 - White
1159:22 - okay beautiful so now
1159:26 - there you go that is our LinkedIn clone
1159:30 - it is looking absolutely gorgeous you
1159:34 - can log in you can log out I mean every
1159:36 - single functionality is there we're
1159:38 - using Redux we have our drop down menus
1159:41 - working I mean this is beautiful like
1159:43 - think about it right like if I go mobile
1159:45 - mode
1159:46 - right look at how good the mobile
1159:49 - version looks just absolutely
1159:53 - freaking beautiful okay so this is an
1159:56 - amazing clone you've done a great job so
1159:59 - far and now for the last piece of the
1160:02 - puzzle all we're gonna do is we're gonna
1160:04 - deploy it together okay so sometimes um
1160:09 - I forget my deploying commands but let's
1160:12 - just go ahead and figure it out
1160:15 - um you know in this video so first
1160:16 - things first but one thing I know that I
1160:20 - need to do is I'm gonna need to run npm
1160:23 - run build and I'm also going to need to
1160:25 - set up Firebase hosting okay so we're
1160:28 - gonna go ahead through that process now
1160:32 - um let's try let's try um
1160:36 - npm run build
1160:40 - okay and let's see it go through the
1160:44 - build
1160:47 - okay and then we're going to do Firebase
1160:50 - deploy and let's see what happens and
1160:51 - then we run into errors we'll try to
1160:53 - solve them together okay not to worry
1160:55 - just make sure you're inside of um the
1160:58 - main folder like LinkedIn clone okay
1161:00 - main directory now we should have a
1161:02 - build folder and this is going to be all
1161:04 - our optimized images and files that are
1161:07 - going to be ready are are going to be
1161:10 - essentially production ready
1161:12 - okay so there we go that's good our
1161:17 - build is good to go and now I'm gonna
1161:20 - try doing Firebase
1161:23 - deploy
1161:25 - so I'm imagining I'm gonna get some kind
1161:27 - of error or some kind of process okay
1161:30 - cool
1161:31 - no worries let's see do I have any
1161:34 - Firebase commands that I've written
1161:38 - uh-huh so I remember the command is
1161:41 - actually Firebase and net that's what I
1161:43 - was looking for okay so we're just going
1161:45 - to initialize it let's go here and
1161:47 - select hosting because
1161:50 - we're going to need to host it
1161:53 - um so that's good let's go use an
1161:56 - existing project and let's go to where's
1162:00 - LinkedIn clone
1162:07 - is it actually logged into the right one
1162:09 - because I'm not seeing my project
1162:16 - okay I'm gonna end out of it let's do
1162:18 - Firebase init one more time and let's go
1162:20 - hosting
1162:22 - okay and uh let's create a new project
1162:24 - because that that project just might not
1162:28 - have been there
1162:30 - okay
1162:37 - let's call it LinkedIn
1162:40 - clone
1162:42 - or would you like to call your project
1162:45 - LinkedIn clone
1162:48 - I did not mean to specify an ID
1162:54 - there's already a project with LinkedIn
1162:55 - clone okay all good so let's actually go
1162:58 - to Firebase from here
1163:02 - okay let's go to project overview
1163:06 - project settings
1163:11 - okay link to a Firebase hosting site
1163:14 - let's see if we can do that boom
1163:21 - okay and let's go through the init
1163:24 - project uh init process one more time
1163:27 - let's do hosting
1163:30 - hit enter
1163:33 - um I don't think it's gonna let me
1163:35 - select an existing project
1163:38 - why is it not seeing any of the
1163:40 - linkedins though that's what I'm curious
1163:44 - about because
1163:51 - this sees all this other stuff
1163:56 - but it not does not see any of the
1163:58 - linkedins which is very interesting to
1164:01 - me
1164:04 - so one thing you can do is make sure
1164:07 - so it's because I'm logged into the
1164:10 - wrong Firebase I'm going to see if I can
1164:12 - log out and I'm going to log into the
1164:14 - right Firebase okay that's really where
1164:16 - my problems were coming from
1164:21 - cool
1164:22 - so you can do this too if you're not
1164:25 - logged into Firebase make sure you log
1164:27 - into Firebase if you haven't installed
1164:28 - Firebase make sure you install Firebase
1164:30 - now would be a good time
1164:35 - now I'm logged in to Firebase okay so
1164:39 - good now let's do Firebase and net now I
1164:42 - should see
1164:44 - my dummy LinkedIn clone use an existing
1164:47 - project
1164:49 - the dummy LinkedIn clone that we worked
1164:52 - on
1164:53 - our directory is going to be build I'm
1164:56 - going to hit enter
1165:00 - configure as a single page app I'm going
1165:03 - to say yes set up automatic bills
1165:07 - file Bill already exists you want to
1165:09 - overwrite just hit enter
1165:11 - okay so now we've gone through the
1165:13 - initialization process I've also done
1165:16 - npm run build so I have my build folder
1165:18 - let's try Firebase build
1165:21 - is it gonna work is it gonna work
1165:30 - yo let's go guys
1165:33 - amazing congratulations the LinkedIn
1165:36 - clone that you worked and we worked so
1165:39 - hard for is deployed so now let's go
1165:43 - ahead and check it out hopefully it

Cleaned transcript:

react GS crash course 2021 are you excited about building projects like Tesla Clubhouse Disney and Linkedin these are some of the most powerful apps out there in the world and we will show you how to build these applications completely from scratch using react.js now react.js right now is the number one most popular JavaScript library it is also the number one demanded Library out there for jobs so if you want to get a job as a frontend developer learn this Library build projects like these and you're on your way to get your first job as a frontend developer now an average react Jazz developer makes over a hundred and ten thousand dollars with a lot of potential to get that up to 150 and 200 000. now if you are someone who wants to take this seriously and become a developer in 90 days we have a completely free training for you where you will learn the necessary skills it takes and the stepbystep process you need to take every single week to actually get that first job just click the link below pop in your name and email and we will send you the whole training but guys it would be amazing if you can smash that like button we worked really hard to make these videos really appreciate that so that this video can get out to a lot more people really helps us out with the YouTube algorithm now to thank you for smashing like button we got a baby kitten right here you see there you go all right continue watching the video and enjoy foreign this is Nas from cleverprogrammer and today I know you're already I know you're excited we are building the Tesla cologne check out this amazing Tesla clone here's what we got here it is a Tesla called webpage you guys know Teslas are amazing uh they're really amazing cars so what have we got we're going to use react GS right that's part one it's very Jazz to build this okay with all this happening we're going to do a few things to style all of this we're gonna use style components it's the one thing you need to understand right so style components are going to be used throughout here on top of that look at let's go ahead and take a look at some of the pages we got Model S page the model 3 page you know uh so forth if I go to for example this model 3 page right here if I scroll down oh look at this beautiful beautiful page that we can see now you can see how we have all these animations right now right when I scroll down we have this beautiful animation to kind of pop up well that's using something called react reveal react reveal which is a really really cool module that we're going to use in this one of course as well we have ourselves a nice sidebar right here okay and to make all this work of course in to save the data the car info data there will also be saved in where well we're in something called react Redux so you guys get the chance to kind of create your own react Redux component here as well right so look this is going to be one of the most amazing clones you will get to build um we should be able to build this in one take no problem whatsoever right so if you're ready let me know give it a thumbs up go ahead and smash that like button for us it honestly means the world to us it tells us that you are excited that you are you know that you like what we're doing and this allows us to do more of it as well of course right and this of course allows YouTube to get this out to more and more people so of course we can go ahead and teach more people at the same time and so forth all right all right other than that let's go ahead and get started right away who's ready who's ready who's ready I see all of you amazing people right there all right let's go ahead um so the first things first that we need to do let me go ahead and put this beautiful music kind of in the background while we're working let me see you make sure is how is everybody doing oh hello hello hello we have so many amazing people we have uh penguin hello hi we have pumped bhavik says beautiful I love it Nas what's up what's up how you doing good good good good let's go hello Diggity Adrian I like it too all right let's go ahead and get this party started to build something like this will of course require a few different things right we just start up first is the react Redux application right this is the code as you can see nothing crazy we have the home page the header page the section page this is our goal in terms of where we need to get to um but for now a few things let's go and open Finder right now right uh if you're on Windows of course it's gonna be for you it's going to be a different situation um just open up your what is it called my computer whatever it has to be and let's go ahead and create a new folder I'm going to open up a new folder inside where well inside pretty much something called a terminal hopefully you guys can have that it's at the terminal right there beautiful and I'm going to zoom in so you can see it much better okay all right and let's go ahead and do the following thing for this you of course need node.js right so hopefully you installed that if you have not installed that install node.js on your computer and everything will be good from there all right so we'll do npx create dash dash react Dash app will give them a react and name so let's go ahead and do 10 Tesla clone Tesla clone beautiful and we'll do dash dash template and Redux is the name of the template right right there hit enter there we go it's kind of compile it's going to do all Necessary Things it needs to do it's gonna work it's gonna go this until okay anyways I'm just you know passing time as it's kind of loading so as you can see it's creating the initial repository that you need right for for what well for basically for your application okay that's what it specifically needs somebody said hi my name is teslaco that's funny Happy hacking is what we currently have happy hacking beautiful it's exactly what we need to get to right that means our application has been complete not completed but it's installed all right uh once that you can go ahead and close this out no problem no problem and at this point let's go and go ahead and open up vs code I will do new window on my side I do not need this portion of this right here that portion goes somewhere else for me uh I could probably do it somewhere else let me go ahead I put this portion desktop too there we go all right beautiful all right so this is our views code let's open this up on the left hand side and put my testicle on the right hand side so it's a little bit better all right I like it as to file open file open beautiful go to GitHub and then go to Nas and then there's the Tesla code that we just opened up right so I will open up Tesla clone here okay beautiful all right so okay and let's see what we've got so far all right there's a Tesla car there you go beautiful um what do we have well to actually start this let's go right click this go ahead and open in the integrated terminal all right and what we will do is we'll do yarn what yarn start so we're going to use yarn this time because it's okay you can use both npm and yarn are both amazing so and yarn start oh that's going to start our application hope you guys can hear me all well yeah it's going to start our application uh this is not pretty cool this is actually live guys by the way this is I'm live I can see you I can see you right now in the comments if you say hi I say hi back to you as simple as that all right let's go ahead and do that the beautiful nice nice nice nice nice nice okay let's see let's see let's see okay all right so this is our webpage that we have right now this is not the technical don't you worry okay uh this is just a starter application that react usually comes with right um so at this point uh what are we going to do all right we need to erase some of this stuff let's go ahead and go to app.js right here and let's go to the header blah blah blah and let's remove this stuff honestly we don't need any of this stuff right here sayonara baby done you're away all right now we have a white screen which is pretty good too right we've got ourselves the white screen all right hit enter all good let's go to some index.css some of this stuff we don't need as well so we can remove some of this stuff which is just unnecessary too okay all right beautiful and so here we go now at this point a few things that we need to do as well is we need to divide this into application into a few different pieces correct and what kind of pieces would you divide this into well let's think about this right if I will if I have something like this right here's we have we have this application this might be like the whole app right so this is the whole app after that what do we have well we have the header right we have the header which is this one right this header might be divided into a few different parts as well we've got the logo we might have ourselves the menu like maybe we call it like the left menu icon or the left menu bar and then we have the right menu right there right underneath that we have the actual content or which is this we will call like a section right and now this section has a few different things right let's think about it okay well the first job is like this text component so this contains Like the Model S the order online and stuff like that right so that's we'll call the text component okay then what do we have we have a button component right here okay it's a button component that will contain the buttons like custom order existing delivery and so forth and our last one is going to be this really fancy bouncing don't bouncing bouncing bouncing uh Arrow okay um and that's pretty much it and our goal is to repeat these components so forth and so forth as you kind of go forward and so forth I see right there see right so that's pretty much it and as a repeat uh you know there's nothing else to it um and of course after that we'll figure out how to create the other Pages like a detail page and so forth okay all right beautiful um so let's go ahead and get started all right beautiful so as we said the first we need to create is going to be the header component and let's go ahead and do that so I will do Source new folder and I will say components on that component components uh commandantos componentos componentials okay let's go do a new file and we'll say header.js okay all right and I'm going to use something called react Snippets as you can see right here we have something called es7 react snippet so hopefully you guys can install that as well on your side um right if you install those don't have them go ahead and click install I already have them installed but what they will help me to do is if I go to ahead of that GS check this out all I gotta do is type it the following rfce done hit enter right like this is pretty cool what do we have ourselves well we have ourselves a function component that's what we had so ourselves right here okay and if I say header here right here right and then I'm going to import the header into app.js so let's do that right now so we'll go ahead and do import what import header from from what well a few things components so we'll have to hit the components folder slash header voila beautiful all right and we'll use the header now like so okay save that and let's go and see our new beautiful what is it our beautiful header component which is just pretty much just a head of text um let's actually make it much better right so here's what we can do now at this point guys is let's go ahead and go to indus.css and a few things I want to do is to change right um let's go ahead and Target everything right now right so again nothing crazy so far let's go and Target everything and the first thing I want to change I want to change the font family all right to make it more robotic It also says Rubik Rubik's Cube whatever's gonna be all right that's gonna be the first one let's go and change the color of also of this specific what of the specific um code of this webpage so this will apply to everything pretty much right this color will apply to every every any type of text right as you want to keep it consistent I'll give it a margin of zero so that there's all these headings do not have all these crazy margins which I don't like I give it a padding of zero as well okay good all right awesome and we're going to use something called something called border size oh no box sizing border box now for those of you who don't know what this is it's basically when you say the width of something it's going to include the padding within that div it's a little bit confusing but basically uh this will allow us to better control the width of the actual dips that's what that will allow us to do box sizing will say border box border Dash box there we go so I know I have a hard time typing sometimes guys so you can see all right let's go and focus on the body now so the body and we'll give it a width of what width of a hundred percent right here okay good and honestly that's pretty much it okay with 100 that's all I need so far okay good uh let's go back to our this okay you see our header now looks a little bit more different which is completely okay after the header what do we saving to create we need to create the actual home home page right so we have the home page and we have the header okay um let's create the home page now and components do a new file and we'll do home.js right all right and we'll do rfce again I love this one rfce and you got yourself a seat I don't know whatever all right uh same thing this one let's go ahead and do home okay we'll import inside app.js right here and so forth home Dash like this okay import it right here so import ante import home from what components componentos componentos component National home okay don't judge me all right good let's see what we got so far and we got ourselves a home components now I'm going to come with the header one for now just temporarily because I'm going to focus only on the home component right now okay and again I just want to make sure this is clear if you cannot follow along don't worry about it you know this is you know this will be available after you know the this is done so don't worry about if you cannot follow along just go ahead and review it again all right beautiful so the home component is there which I really really like um now let's focus on a few different things within the home component uh and let's go to home.js now for the styling we're going to use local style components and we need to install them first so go to your terminal let's go ahead and click Plus on it and we'll do yarn add and we'll do styled Dash style Dash components style Dash compo components there we go nope yarn oh yeah yeah but yarn add yarn there we go okay so it's going to go ahead and add the yard all right save that that's all good and we will now import import styled from what okay imports from styled Dash components good save that all right now for this component the first time we're going to create is something called the container component so we'll do is container no not container container okie dokie okie dokie container there we go container so that's going to be our first component that we'll do and with the container component let's go ahead is equal to style so this is basically will give us allow us to style the specific div right that's the power of style component instead of doing it inside CSS we do inside JavaScript and so it just makes things a lot easier for us right and now we'll do a height height of what 100 VH 100 VH good how are you guys doing by the way all doing good is everybody doing good everybody's still kind of on track with me if you guys are let me know let me know let me know let me see everybody's doing amazing somebody uh somebody says I like how Nas uses the different boxes to show us the different uh yeah different things that's amazing awesome thank you thank you I appreciate you guys all right so a height of 100 VH so let's go ahead and save that and let's look at what we have so far nothing okay it's kapusta it's pretty much nothing right now okay again what we're making right now is the what well we're making the component that's going to be this component right here so it's this whole component right which is this yellow component that's what we're working on right now right this whole yellow component that's the home.js okay um and within this home.js let's think about kind of well how are we going to create all these sections right we have this one section another one section another section and you can see the style of them was just pretty much the same you see they're pretty much the same right there so logically speaking what if you just create another carbonical section and that will allow us to reuse it every single time so if I right click on it let's do a new file and I say section section yes okay good yes and we'll do rfce here too and enter okay section is what we need to type in go to 100.js and let's import our first section so it's an import section from what from from what well because our current home.js inside the components folder we don't need anything else besides that right um we don't ask anything else besides that instead what we need is is just simply dot slash section like this right because we're already in the components folder okay let's go ahead and type in section to actually use it okay good beautiful all right awesome and then let's see what we've got so far nothing well we've got this section which is good all right in this section that GS now I promise now this is where the magic happens okay the magic happens now here all right okay so if we go to our section.js a few things that we need to really consider okay just how we consider this what do we say let's go ahead and create this text component first uh that's the first one but before even doing that I'm going to create a wrap so here's what I'll do I'm gonna create a wrap here right there wrap and that's going to be component we'll just call the wrap we can call the container whatever has to be and so forth all right let's import style components so import I'm going to use here we go import ante import installed styled from what from style Dash components okay good all right that's so good and then uh let's go ahead and create the wrap so const wrap is equal to what styled dot div okay start.dev now this is where again our fancy styled div component you know is gonna happen well they were almost at 496 likes if you can get us to 500 let's do that guys 500 likes they'll be amazing and I just want to also let you know guys by the way uh one really important thing down below what's gonna happen right now is we are we have a fulltime Master bootcamp that we've launched a while ago and we have a new class starting in June and so there's a limited spots to go ahead and join and so we have a limited availability for new students to join um full stack Mastery we have a lot of students join fulltime Mastery in the previous classes and it's been amazing so many positive results so many people getting jobs and so many people just getting results in general if yourself are interested in actually becoming a developer and you want something that will push you give you kind of a kind ability to give you some guidance give a give you proper guidance a proper road map like a fullon road map for six seven eight months right but you will stick with us the whole time you get mentored by Me by Kazi and the whole team here at clever programmer right like I said full story Master bootcamp is what we've created to help you do that um if you're interested go ahead we have a seat reservation down below to reserve your seat all it is is just a seat reservation and then we figure out all the financing leader this tells us you're serious and that's pretty pretty much it right like I said link is down below right but the most important part I just want to let you know not everybody gets in some people get denied unfortunately because you know you might not have either good energy or you may you might not be positive or you might just be you know not might not be a good fit so we look at a lot of different things for people to be able to join something like this it's a very much it's a very serious thing that we we um of course we take we take care take this very seriously of course so if you're interested come in there with good energy right put down a your sea reservation link down below and after that we'll get a call and then we'll figure out how to actually get you into the boot camp okay awesome that's pretty much it let's go ahead and continue on beautiful all right uh uh section okay what's gonna happen in this section uh the wrap is nothing nothing crazy the rep is going to be width of a hundred percent width of 100 V we'll call it VW VW it's like the car VW you know but that was my first car actually 100 VW which is the full view width right that's the full view width that's what it means okay then we'll give it a height as well and we'll give it a height of what of 100 VH right here 100 VH so 100 vertical height pretty much is what it says okay all right let's give the background color background of like orange just so you can see exactly what we are working with all right there we go right so this is all working right right the whole view with the whole view height okay all right um at this point let's go ahead and give it a background image and the background image should be this one right here now where you get this background image again what's going to happen is we have a Google drive folder with all the images down below right so if you all you have to do is just simply open this on this one up you open the Google drive folder the images folder and you put it inside your public folder like so so right now I have no images folder of course I can actually open it open up the Google drive folder inside my application let me go ahead and take a look at it where I can do that let me see where do I have it one second I think I have right here actually I have the images folder right here open and find wherever you'll find her there we go so I have my images folded right here right so this is the one that that you guys will get um if you go ahead and download the Google drive folder just go ahead and go description below download it from there and you'll be all good and then all you need to do is need to unzip it of course and then once you've got that just grab that and then drag it into the public folder right like like so just drag it in done right and now it's all in here right this is a lot of different stuff for you um you know between the model S the model 3 all these different images that you need to use okay so if you got that let me know down in the comments and then we'll make sure to take care of you okay beautiful all right uh let's continue on okay all right so when we do the background image well we have a background images called models.jpg so hopefully everybody was able to get those images like I said link is down in description below all right uh background image so far nothing's showing up which is completely fine I was going to remove this background noise I don't want that so hideous there we go um the image is actually there we just don't see it because we need to send out a vertically so we need to Center the actual background image and to do that what I like to say something like background Dash size is equal to cover not covered but covered boom you see now all of a sudden this becomes a very different image right there see okay now let's do at that point let's go inside this image the background image and to do that we'll do background um position so background background Dash position and we'll give it a center boom voila center right I'm acquisition back you know I I did this one back go round position there we go see now this car is pushed in the center which is exactly what we want to do then let's go ahead and make sure it does not repeat itself so we'll do background repeat now repeat so we'll do back round Dash repeat I will say no sorry about that repeat there we go now repeat but no repeat no right there no repeat all right so I'm not just going to change this point right if we still have ourselves everything we need to have and that's pretty pretty much it okay okay that's what I want you to focus on for now now let's go ahead and add in the text component stuff okay what we need to create of course is not going to be this text component which is right here and we're going to call something called like item text so item text okay and inside this item text a few things we need to go ahead and create is of course if we look at our Tesla clone what do we have we have a header and we have like a sub header and to make that happen here's what we'll do we'll do an H1 tag each one and this H1 will have the title for now let's just say the title will be Model S this is the one the title so model has for now this is temporary data placeholder data okay Model S okay beautiful and then uh we'll do another one that's going to be what the P tag P tag let's go ahead and remove that right the P tag and this one's gonna have order online for touches delivery right there boom it and I'll be honest with you it actually is touches delivery when I ordered the Tesla it's like it literally it was like Christmas morning I woke up in the morning and the car was there on my driveway it was pretty insane I will say like they bring it into you and you you don't have to do nothing you just sign and you sign in on your on your Tesla account and then you just say okay take delivery it's pretty cool I will say Okay order online for tattoos delivery all right and then once we got that let's go ahead and save this of course and we need to create the item text component here so we'll say const item text is equal to what styled right here styled dot div okay good all right and with this one uh what do we need to need to do nothing nothing too crazy we're going to give it some padding top so you can see you already have it here it's pretty good it's all we need so we'll do padding top Dash top and that will be 15 VH 15 VH V hush that's pretty funny okay and then we'll do text line Center because you know just to align the center technically already is centered but it's okay okay that's not Center there we go you see now Model S is right here right that part is done let's look at our next part that we need to figure out which is going to be the what that's going to be now the buttons right so that's going to be these buttons right here okay button group okay uh all right let's go ahead and create that component we'll create the component that will actually wrap these buttons right so uh the buttons that we need to go ahead and wrap are these buttons right here right so this is going to be the button group that we're going to create right now okay called the button group right button button sorry my horrible handwriting but I'm trying my best button group okay all right so say button button well I'd like to say button in Korean means bread you know button group and then there'll be a few bundles that we need to create inside here the one is going to be left button and then it's going to be a right button as well so we'll say left button button you like my accent and then the right button right button okay good and then of course all these buttons will have a few different uh there'll be one it's gonna be custom order so let's go ahead and do the custom order one so this could be custom order no I'm not I know what that was honestly custom order save that and the last one is going to be existing inventory existing existing inventory inventory inventory existing inventory that's the one that we're looking at okay beautiful all right existing inventory and let's see what we have so far um well that we need to create the actual components groups of course so we'll do that right now all right so we'll do the what we'll do const button group is equal to styled dot div uh that there for now okay uh nothing crazy so far let's go ahead and create the button the actual that button so we'll do const left button is equal to also style.div okay boom and now for the right button the right button we're going to now use the left button as a reference so what does that mean if I say right button put on is equal to as I've say style that divs can be styled button left button you see this love button why because this allows us to inherit all the CSS of the left button that's pretty much the reason okay now put the button group what are we going to do with the button group uh nothing too crazy so far um let's go ahead and actually focus on the left buttons that's what I want us to focus on right now specifically okay okay so left button all right um okay let's do the following let's see what happens here nothing oh we have some stuff we have custom order and stuff with that okay that's fine all right um for this specific section well here's we'll do we'll do background color of this left button is the following right background color is this color right here okay good that's the background color all right let's remove this stuff right here on this side that's the background color and then what do we need to do is let's do a height of 40 pixels height height of what 40 pixels okay and then we'll give it a width of 206 pixels width of 200 256 pixels okay good all right save that okay show is all good and let's see what we have so far and so far like it's just it's nasty right so but it's okay don't worry about it right and then what we'll do is we'll give it a color so color of white so white okay now yeah white so that's gonna be the text color so you can see now we have the text color right here that's a white text color okay now these are two divs and let's go ahead and Center them in the center right so the mini will do display Flex on them Flex it always likes it ah display facts and then we'll do what uh we'll do Justified content to Center horizontally right horizontally means Justified content Center so we'll do justify let's go ahead and do it this way justify content that's gonna be Center good all right and then we'll do online item Center as well all right items Center as well okay good okay now what do we have so far right justify content online items Center okay um now these are two buttons right so let's go ahead now to make them more look like buttons let's go ahead and add a border radius so we'll do what border Dash radius right and that was going to be what let's go give it a 100 pixels oh would you look at that now we have something now we like to look at right uh it's going to get an opacity and it's going to be 0.85 right okay so now we have an opacity that just kind of stays there which is pretty pretty cool okay all right then the next one is going to be what well uh let's do text transform make sure it's all up okay so text transform all uppercase okay nice that looks sick that looks amazing let's give the smaller font size as well so font Dash size it's gonna be watched that's pretty much just 12 pixels something's nothing crazy yeah there you go good good I like it I like it all right so that's that's the font size and then what um we need to stack that from left to right that's what we need to figure out how to do right how do you stack them from left to right that's the big question right so to do that uh well a few things we need to go the button group and say display Flex on this one boom boom right there you see right away we know what right away it Stacks from left to right that's what this display Flex allows allows us to do okay now how do we put this custom order this is that's the inventory kind of from more at the bottom that's the question I want us to ask right well this happens a few ways well because if we go to the wrap right the wrap controls what let me go ahead and remove this portion now at this point the wrap controls what controls this whole thing right this whole thing right this whole thing right and if I do display Flex on it I can actually push these away so that this goes all the way to the bottom right that's what my goal is right so on the wrap I'm going to say display Flex display I will say the flex Flex it Flex it Flex it Flex it don't forget it display Flex beautiful and then at that point what's going to happen is we'll do what Flex Direction column right so basic column means we're going to put it from top to bottom that's what that means okay nice Direction column there we go see now it's back to normal again now to actually fully make it work all I gotta do and actually push this to the bottom well I do something like um Justified content space between so justify content right and then space Dash between boom oh would you look at that it's like all the way over there you guys see that right there that is beautiful all right let's go ahead and do a line item Center to align it horizontally so interesting part is you need to know is justify content usually does alignment for horizontal section right so if you want to align something horizontally right that's what that's the content is for and usually align items is going to be a vertical alignment okay but when you switch the flex Direction it switches it flips now justify content is going to be for is going to be for this one is going to be for vertical alignment vertical and then align items now if I do center right here that's going to be for horizontal alignment whole horizontal you see what I mean so it flips when you do five Direction column you can see now the custom order they're actually they are actually properly aligned right now okay beautiful uh but I want us to focus on now is gonna be the the button group let's go ahead and take this button Google let's give it a margin bottom margin bottom margin bottom off uh about 30 pixels so it's kind of it's a little bit better now there too okay so I like that a lot better now right and what else do we have let's for these specific buttons let's give them what let's give them a cursor pointer as well so left button it's gonna be cursor cursor pointer okay save that all right so now there I can let me see Cur sir cursor okay save that I see I can it now exist as a cursor as well all right now a few things open passage is 0.5 that's all good opacity is good a few things I want to focus on um let's add this specific portion remember this one this this like well that is just simply an arrow that's all it is nothing too crazy um so to do that what we'll do is we'll create something called a down arrow as oh that's just an image right so here's we'll do we'll create it outside the button group and we'll say the following we'll say down Arrow like so source is equal to what source is going to be equal to images down here let's face G so we have to inside the images folder again if you want the link to it down below okay boom down arrow okay down arrow images down here right here is that defined again it's going to create that let's create that I need to create to create so we'll do here we'll do what const down arrow down arrow okay is equal to what is equal to styled dot image right there okay on this image a few things we need to go and create you'll do margin top margin Dash Dash margin Dash top that's going to be 20 pixels to give some spacing right and then I will give the height so a height oh height of what 40 pixels okay nice so it says styled style styled styled there we go all right so the arrow is now there the custom order is there so it's not the best solution as we need right so um don't worry we'll fix that in a second here okay so you can see what do we have now here's the issue this is now here and this is now here bad right because why because when we did justify content we did space between meaning it's going to create as much space in between every single component here right that's what space in between means right but how do we fix it well very simple by actually making this making this one component right right so for example if I say generous buttons if I give like this buttons okay check this out buttons okay boom what's gonna happen now what do you think oh new component correct yes yes yes yes that's going to create new components so called buttons we'll say const of buttons but is equal to style that div save that right there see you see what just happened right see this just became like this right see but they're beautiful right it's exactly what we need what we need for this for this right there right there see beautiful and let's go back to now our page application now um how did that happen well because this whole thing became one component that's what happened right this whole thing became one component and so this just pushed it down like this right all right uh up next let's go ahead and create a little margin between every single button so if I go to my left button I will do margin what I will go ahead and do the following which is margin I think we'll give it 20 pixels I think it's pretty good um either that or they only just maybe eight pixels see margin margin 8 pixels like this okay much better much better now I would like for this thing to hop so uh we're gonna make it hot how uh well we're going to create an animation we're going to create animation okay uh to do to make that happen here's animation it's going to be animation called animate down and if I go to my down arrow in here but right there check this out so right now nothing's happening because we have not created animation you see so it's just kind of like it's like meh right it's meh right now but don't you worry we got you okay don't you worry we got you um what I'm gonna do now at this point is very simple is I will go to innis.css right here and I'm going to create the animation myself right this is using keyframes right using keyframes is what it's going to do and I'm just going to copy and paste it here because I'm going to type it out all for you right and what these are is very simple here's what happened imagine like for example that you know uh so keyframes are like percentages of like uh of the actual um or the actual text or the deal for example right so at zero twenty percent you know nothing now at 40 we're going to translate translate basically five pixels up you see right there you see then at 60 I'm going to translate three pixels up now at 50 we're going to translate to zero so that's what creates this up and down feeling so if I save this right now boom see that's what creates this upside down up up and down filling to do you see right that's okay the upper up and down kind of like feeling type and so forth right um this also creates a little bit of an issue with overflow as you can see right here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to give overflow hidden on this specific down arrow right here so this down arrow you see how it creates overflow well we can do fix that by just going a section right and I'm going to say overflow hidden overflow overflow X overflow Dash X is going to be hidden boom okay overflow overflow axis hidden let's see down arrow is that let's go ahead maybe fix it using what what can we use fix it using what if I maybe I remove this portion let's go and remove this okay I kind of like that I don't want that margin top it kind of pushes way too much all right so that's good overflow x hidden uh if I go to body let's go to index.css oh okay I need to also do overflow overflow Dash X it's gonna be hidden boom boom see to make sure we don't have the horizontal scroll bar that was there which would look hideous which I don't like all right so there you go so we got now our translation which is really good okay so we have a translation what's the next step we are going to work on and that's going to be let me see what you guys are saying something is awesome that's awesome sweet uh SCS is the way to go yes we'll actually go into scss at some point as well on this channel too uh are you building that using react yes I am change my Butters are not all the way down there what you put but yeah so now they're all down sweet now it's all good now it's all good now it's all good okay sweet all right everybody still with me everybody's still with me yeah beautiful of course you are because you guys are amazing that's all I can say to you all right and again guys let's go and hit that like button smash that like button to help us out with the YouTube algorithm that's it that really we're at 673 likes let's get to 800 that'll be great all right um all right so we got that portion look at this let's go and change up this button now the existing delivery button because it actually is different here um pretty simple because we go to our section.js here's our button all we gotta do is just change the button color so the right button instead of doing here nothing the right button will be the following the right button will be back on color of white background doesn't mean white boom oh let's go I mean we're gonna give the opacity to opacity right 0.65.65 there we go okay and that will give the color of the text it's gonna be more of a darker side colors will be black there we go nice you see there you go now we got these two buttons and they look pretty good look at that look at that that's it that's all we just did we just did everything we need to do look at this huh how cool is that huh awesome all right so we're almost there now if you check this out all we gotta do now this one is just replicate the same situation right so if I go ahead and go to sections now apologize if I copy this section and paste everywhere all right if I paste this section check this out what's going to happen we have more section of the same sections there you go that's it now I want us to really figure out the one is like for example if I go small you see how the custom order just kind of like goes outside the boundary we can fix that too actually we can fix that very easily using like media queries right so so basically what we can do is on uh let me go ahead and take a look at it go to section here you see button this button group right here this button group is it's actually a flash Direction row but if I would go ahead on the media which is what I can do I can do media width like this so on the max with basically four four like small uh Max width of 768 pixels those are like small um screens I do flash actually column and so they go into column basically meaning from top to bottom like this all right so to this side you see that just happened look at there you see right and how this happened because when the width becomes 768 pixels you see it applies this right here CSS flag Direction column that's what allows us to do this and that's it there's nothing crazier than that honestly all right so now here's the question now um how do we go ahead and make these Model S stuff and make have all this stuff working differently right because what we have right now is just open the list and of course we have model y by the way this is the one oh this is actually the one I have by the way such a beautiful card look at this oh so good Ah that's such a good car I love it the Special is in this blue color it's so good wouldn't you guys agree with me like in a blue color like that's my favorite color by the way yeah uh anyways uh let's go ahead and do the following we have all these sections right and they're all the same so the question is like how do we make them different right how do we make them different so they're all different I guess I can say um well we could just pass in something called props right and what are props props are like parameters for a function that's pretty much all it is it's a parameter for a function right so if we currently have the model S right and we have one section we can reuse this just change the title here so here's what I'll do I'll go to home or let's go I'll go to home here and for the section here look we'll pass in a few parameters it's just kind of like you're passing parameters for a function that's pretty much it inside here I will pass in two for three parameters so let's go ahead and do title okay not like this title is equal to what and this is going to be Model S right and then the description is all gonna be well pretty much you know delivery so the screen is going to be ordered online the description right here let me go ahead and make this beggar for you order online for touches the description after that let's go ahead and do what let's do background image background image that's with the model S1 then we'll do the left button text right we have a left button that's gonna be the custom order and then the right button text is going to be existing inventory there you go okay let's go ahead and comment this portion of four temporarily okay because I want to show you how we're going to do this so this gets passed into props if I go into the section itself let's go hang on the section itself okay and I have props here they're basically like parameters if I just click install login cancel the log prompts don't visit I'm gonna show you this for a second here so look props right clicked inspect element on this one and I will show it to you within the console right here good all it is is props just an object like that's all pretty much is and look at this all this stuff has been passed in right the background image the description the title and so forth and so now all I do is something like for example I'll do this under the following what I do I do props props that What DOT title all right I save that Raza title look at that look at that model S right here see that title like it was replaced by the actual title within the actual what the actual component right that's all we pretty much had to do okay now we can't even be smart about this by doing the following we can unpack this using something like this so I can do it like this title boom right there how cool is that okay okay how cool is that check this out so title is right there and I can replace this with title and all this done is this basically just unpacks this whole object this whole object has key and no key like background image and so forth but this right here is called unpacking and we're unpacking the object to include to actually just get the get the actual Keys that's that's all pretty much does all right so let's say let's go ahead and stop this for now good all right so we have that next one that we're going to unpack is which one that's a description good description which is which one comma description and we can use that here now boom boom description boom right there awesome you see again shows up right here okay beautiful just just the way we like it okay next step is going to be what the actual left button text so this is this one left button text right here that button text is going to be this one and then right there and then the right button text is going to be right here right button text so we'll use that as a prop as well okay right by text of course we do unpack them as well so we'll do what left button text copy that left button text right here comma right button text command C command V all right so we have unpacked all of these items inside here so if we save that right you can see you know still and nothing really changes but here's what we can change if I go to home and if I uncomment some of this stuff okay now I have three different sections what I can do is just change the actual data so here's what I can do here inside this one I can give it the following here's my data here boom this one is title model.p what model y p y model dot y That's the uh they asked the other one description order online background images now model Y image and then left button text custom order and same thing here so if I save this oh look at that you see model y has changed now one thing has not changed is the actual image and we'll focus that we'll we'll fix that in a second here next one let's do model three okay let's do model 3 now same thing you see so all we do is we're showing the props we're just passing different props and we're using the same HTML that's the coolest part about react.js good boom there we go save that let's see model three now again image does not change we'll change that in a little bit okay next one model X let's do the model X1 Model X all right we'll do the following there so Model X okay Papa there we go okay model X all right same thing look at this model X you see it all just kind of works you know automatically no problem whatsoever now the one big thing we need to figure out is okay well how come the images are not showing well in the section because the image is the same right the image is which image it's uh it's this image right here that's a background image right um to fix that it's pretty simple actually let's go ahead and go to the home.js and inside actually let's go to section.js my bad section and we need to pass in the actual background image you see we pass on this background image let's go ahead and copy this background image go to section and we'll go ahead and unpack this right here comma unpack it right here unpack it so now we have it you know we can actually have it inside our component and we need to use it somehow actually okay how do we use it well we use it by actually passing in um well passing an actual component or a prop into a style component because you can do that too serious audio BG background image background emit background image and we'll say what equal boom right BG image they could have background image that's all and now all we do is inside what is inside our actual what our actual BG image will wrap see how we have the wrap here basically instead of doing this here's what we'll do in this case do like this we'll say background image back on this image okay let me just do it properly so you guys can have it so right here background image okay and instead of doing like this I'll do like this okay props so we can actually get props inside style components we'll do props okay and after props what are we gonna say check this out okay we'll give a URL here so say URL that I actually will do like this we'll say URL and we'll be uh Dash images Dash Dash the actual prop that we just passed in Dash what that's what huh boom look at this look at this one that's pretty cool I will do props Dot perhaps.what WG image right there after BG image WG image okay so let's see what happens now so okay we had this images URL and that has images inside of that okay good okay let's see let's see let's see and then we of course I think I think we need to close it as well let me go ahead and make sure it's all good so that's all good that must be all good URL is right here that's the URL icon image yeah I don't think that's an issue all right let's go and say this background image okay cool now you're ready let's see if it actually changes anything so what's gonna happen here we pass in the background image here voila okay then we what happens then is that gets passed into the rap style component right there see VG image then that gets back to the prop so we have we get props from the actual style component now we have props and we set the background image using the prop so Props URL images browser BG image that's it save it oh let's go look at this look at this guys model 3 Model X how cool is that right we just pass in the prompts and now we have all of these different components that are there for us to use look at this is that that is pretty insane I will say so hmm what do you guys think so far what do you guys think so far let me see what are you guys thinking oh everything is working everything is working almost at 800 likes let's go let's get to a thousand guys you guys are amazing you guys are amazing 800 like let's go so again we're passing in props at this point and here's what bill look at this we build ourselves a full on Tesla I mean we haven't built a Tesla clone just yet fully but it's getting there it's getting there it's pretty cool all right let's finish up the actual um sections so I will go to here and I will do the following so let's go ahead and go to home.js and we have a few more sessions we need to finish up right next one is going to be the solar panels section so I'll do a section all right it's a solar panel section okay and I have it right here for you guys so you can just copy this on yourself put them right there okay all right title lowest cost solar panels description money back guarantee background image is this one order now this done let's see it now let's see it oh it's so good it's so good guys it's just so good so good okay next one solar for new roofs so that's another one we're gonna also also create right now so here's another section we're going to create you see how easy this stuff is is so easy to create now right because all we're doing is just we're using the same component but but with different uh parameters what is now oh so good oh my God oh my God it's so good guys I don't know I just love these images I love these images though I can tell you next one last one is going to be the accessory section which is going to be this section right here last section at the accessories so feel free to cover this on your own by yourself as well title accessory description is nothing a lap button is nothing and then right by the text we don't have any of that as well let's go ahead and remove that instructor nice let's go ahead and see okay now here's one issue that we found right so here's an issue we have the shop now button right shut now button and then because we only have one button here this created one issue well the fact that this channel button is on the center which of course is bad so how do we fix that pretty simple if I now go to my section.js basically here's what I'll say if the right button exists only then will I go ahead and showcase it so here's what I'll do to this out I will say right button right button text okay then I will go ahead and do the following and then only then will I do this boom boom boom boom boom boom right there that's all save it look at this you see shop now button is exactly the middle because why before the right button was always there just it had their empty right button text but now now what happened is we just said hey if the right button text exists only then do you show the right button the actual right button but if it doesn't does not exist forget about it don't even show it and the last button is going to be the only one that's left and that's pretty much it okay oh yes look at this is so good oh my God you guys this is

we've got this now I want us to focus on a v header that's what I want us to focus on now at this point all right uh let's go ahead and do this let's go ahead and in our this this whole git do ad and we'll say sections sections for the Tesla that's pretty funny for the Tesla okay save that beautiful all right section of the Tesla oh it's good next up um a few different things huh what are we gonna say what are we gonna do we're gonna do head of the GS here's what we're working on now let's go ahead and put the header inside here right go let's go let's go the head is pretty big actually and it will require some a good amount of work guys okay we're quite a good amount of work oh 800 likes that is pretty pretty awesome pretty awesome all right header let's go ahead and import stock components so import styled from style components style Dash component there we go all right sweet sweet sweet good let's go ahead and do the following we'll do create a what create a container here like we always like to do container right there all right so create a container here as well all right let's go ahead and create this idea so import styled up no no const container oops is equal to what style dot What DOT div there we go that's going to be the container okay and now for this container a few different things and this container will have the first thing it will have is of course let's think about it what does it have initially well a few different things let me go ahead and show this to you well we'll have the header and so when you what we have the kind of like the um we have the logo that's part one and we have the menu That's part two and we have the right menu That's part three okay that's part three so with vitamin into three parts let's do uh first let's go ahead and do the logo okay I'll create an etad right because the logo will have will have a link and we'll give it a an image right here look at this out image right here this is the image their image it's only so image source images logo.svg that's it save that let's see does it show up somewhere uh not really why because in the Honda JS actually inside the app.js we're not importing this there we go let's go ahead and uncomment the hair.gs so we can actually use it beautiful hey you guys have the toaster logo look at that it's a beauty it's such a bad yes oh something happened that's really interesting I don't want that okay header nice all right let's go ahead and click on the menu so we'll do menu menu okay sweet so that's the menu okay menu is not defined because we're going to create this right now so as a const menu is equal to what styled dot div customer your style dot okay also nothing crazy here let's go ahead and give some data or some styling for the actual container the actual header so the header will have a few things number one let's give them in height main height of what of 60 pixels there we go okay 60 pixels okay good that's the main height right there see so it's a little bit bigger now that's good and you see it's white but we actually kind of want to be on the one position fixed so we actually want to be a in you know actually have fixed positioning and so to do that here's what we'll do position fixed right position fix means what means that it will just be here right here you see it's always there on the top no matter what it is no matter what no matter where you are okay next um but it's following the display Flags so display Flex to align a vertical here to align them vertically Center so this play display Flex right here Flex okay good all right next up we'll do online items Center oh I don't want God ah see the Tesla centered okay good let's go ahead and give some padding so we'll say padding 0 20 pixels done oh okay good beautiful all right all right so now look at that it's pretty pretty much there look at that the Tesla clone okay all right so that's all good uh the next thing we need to work on is going to be the what the menu the menu has a few different things um what does it have well we've got ourselves what Model S model 3 Model X model y that's what it has okay that's what it's got to make that happen let's go ahead and do this okay in the menu let's give it a P tag ptech and inside that that will be an ATAC ref is equal to currently nothing nada okay boom okay good and so that has the following that has let's go ahead and say for example like Model S Model S for now okay that's the model that's the thing that's the P tag that we're going to use all right all right let's go ahead command C command V command so though might be what model X there's going to be model what is it what are the models here what is it the model S model three model three who's excited for The Roaster by the way that's gonna be really cool Model X I'm really excited for the Roadster that's going to be a crazy car if model Y is a crazy car model S is a crazy car I mean all of them are pretty much crazy I just can't imagine what the rose is going to be all right okay good awesome sweet so that's pretty awesome all right let's see what happens now okay there we go okay um so what happens here is you can see we have the a tag which kind of makes it you know has underline looking very much easily fix that by going inside the index.css boom let's keep the a tank so let's target all a tag ATech and we'll do text transformation or text transform none what does that mean oh text equation not so text decoration because by default it's underlined where is it right here that's the default one but instead we'll just say what none so if I save that see it's gone nice beautiful all right next one is in the menu you see how they're kind of like one on one one on top of each other we can fix that also by using display Flex let's go to menu okay and in the menu all we gotta do is the following it's just a split flexion display Flex display Flex it that's how we do it and we'll do online items um no no we'll do display Flex which let's go ahead and save that nice beautiful we will do a line item Center good beautiful that's amazing okay nice nice nice lineup Center that centers it let's go ahead and also give it maybe some spacing I would say so as well uh and to do that let's go ahead and Target the actual uh uh let's see uh P within this here so I'll do what font weight I will do what can I do it here let's do find weight is going to be 600 okay good nice beautiful and we'll do a text decoration text decoration correlation that's going to be uppercase boom that now workout types decoration text transform actually text Transformer bet transform there we go Model S models three beautiful nice and then let's go ahead and give some padding so for every single Pita I will give a padding so padding padding is going to be zero 10 pixels zero this in this case means top and bottom so basically top about a zero left and right is 10 pixels that's what that means oh my Daisy right there see oh let's also do flags for app Flex um rap let's do no rap all right to make sure there's not wrapped because I like the fact that it's wrapping like you know and so forth um I think it's just no rap like this I feel like that ah Maybe I'm Wrong anyways so here's what we got so far which is pretty good all right um a few different things I want us to focus on as well what we're going to do is we're going to make this menu basically a full width so Flex one so but given a flex one we're giving a full kind of weight Flex one and then if I say something like this for example if I say just the content Center check this out justify content boom no Justified content what happens here no nothing uh justify content align item Center let me see here container display Flex let me make sure it's all good why is it not doing so justify content Center that's one why is it not because here's the goal I wanted to also fully be the full width here so if I do inspect element let's see what happens Happening Here Right Now okay we have this all it's actually not the full width it's unfortunate it's actually because this is not the forward oh so you see this right here this is why inspectile is so important sometimes guys you see the full header is not the full width of the actual page now to make that happen it's pretty easy actually check this one out check this one out so to make that happen all we have to do is the following um is we give it right here so this container you see this container the header is I do the following I say top zero right that will stick it to the to the zero to the top okay that's love zero will stick it to the left okay now right zero it will stick it to the right meaning it will expand you see right there it says what happened it will expand the header with the full width after just happened you see that right there the header is the full width how cool is that right how cool is that so that's what just happened so now we have these specific models okay great the last the next thing you need to work on is going to be what well uh that's gonna be uh this shop Tesla account let's go ahead and make that one happen too so that's pretty easy as well and again some of this stuff is also going to be like we'll change it up later on to make sure it's actually like you know the menu is right so now we'll do the right menu all right menu right menu okay and inside the right menu there'll be a few different things we'll have first it will have a schref is equal to what I'm gonna go ahead and actually um I think this shouldn't be P I think we should remove this stuff I think there should be just a tags honestly that's something you hear same thing with this boom remove this just so we have an attack there's no reason to have all these P tags so it just will consistent throughout the whole thing okay and you can use command D to make sure it's all consistent okay so a schref and then it's gonna be in the same course and this will be a shop okay okay next one's gonna be a schref a Shroff is going to be equal to what is equal to href is equal to which one which is actually Tesla account so let's go ahead and do that we'll be uh Tesla account good good good and the last thing we need to do is we need an icon that's like a burger icon right here so we'll do that in a second here but first i'm going to focus on the right menu That's What I want to focus on for a second here okay so let's do right menu so save that of course we don't that does not not defined right now so that's not a problem whatsoever so we'll do menus this menu okay so we'll do a tag here instead of P make sure you're targeting a tag now at this point you see okay good all right let's go ahead and do const right menu is equal to what style dot div that's all it is okay um let's see here right menu is not defined yes it is you just need to refresh it there we go all right same thing we can do also the same thing on this one and also Target the actual individual what the individual a tags using something like this boom you see save it hey let's go beautiful all right so that's that's pretty good I kind of like that so let's find ways for 100 text transform uppercase on the right menu padding let's go the only thing I will remove probably is going to be like the the padding and I'll set up to do margin margin right 10 pixels so now the shop that's a kind of more closer that's something I'll do at this point and then let's go ahead and remove this don't need this okay good I like that um the only thing it's pretty much we need to do is let's see let's see let's see it's going to be that the little uh hamburger menu that's what it's called so if I go to my Tesla account you see there's a hamburger menu we can fix that so we can actually make that work it's pretty cool check this one out to make this one work it's it kind of works like this um we're gonna use material UI so material UI icons let's go install that one let's go to here beautiful all right and here's I'm gonna show you icons and you just type in menu done here's our menu you see right there Dune let's go import this command C okay and then put it into our actual what right here so import that now how do you actually need to install of course immature UI so to install into install material UI core and material UI icon so let's go ahead and do install material UI right there there we go right here so the first thing to install is going to be I'm actually going to use yarn so I'm going to say yarn and material UI core so to do that let's go ahead and open inside integrate terminal right there beautiful and we'll do yarn add material UI course that's the core uh which is basically material UI save that add that beautiful very very beautiful we're almost eight 854 likes let's go let's get to 900 you guys are amazing as always 900 likes that'll be awesome okay next one is gonna be material UI icons and to do that we'll do yarn add material icons right here okay again command K boom boom chicka we're done okay well I do this I'm gonna drink my hmm so good so good so good all righty beautiful nice nice nice nice nice nice nice while that's doing hope you guys are still with me hope you guys are enjoying the build all the Tesla clone is going to be interesting one I think I'll be really cool to build is actually the Tesla clone dashboard you know how there's a dashboard where the Teslas use inside there that'll be amazing to build and I we're working on that one as well so that's gonna be really cool um but yeah some exciting things happening guys that you have no idea there you go all right let's see so that's all good now to use material UI we've done already here look at this we install material UI and now we just import the menu icon that's the only thing that we now need okay let's see in the patient I thought that was pretty funny don't you guys think so yeah I think it's pretty funny all right guys let's go ahead and continue on you guys are always as always are amazing there was a party code you know it that's how we do it all right guys so is math important for coding no it's not I'll just answer that for you math is not a portable coating at all in fact it's you don't need it at all like zero zip knowledge nothing just so you know all right beautiful all right now at this point let's go ahead and add a menu icon we're going to create our own menu icon because uh we'll change the styling of it so we'll say custom menu custom menu right here right here and we'll use the menu icon like so so let's go ahead we'll do right here so const custom menu is equal to styled styled what styled nope styled what style menu icon style menu icon right there see style menu icon okay now what can I do with the style menu icon really nothing I'm kidding I can do a lot so here's what happened here check this out oh it's so good that's so good all right beautiful I like it um for the right menu let's go ahead and display Flex it so display Flex to make sure it's all align Center so display Flex display Flex okay beautiful and we'll do a line items Center just under the center or something there we go display flag Center align I'm Center there it goes right there on the menu icon will do a cursor pointer cursor that is going to be pointer good good good good good good good good good good cursor pointer refresh it oh let's go and nothing's happening so far I don't worry about that just yet okay now another thing I want us to focus on is going to be look look how by the way guys just want to say how good does this look already look at this guys this is sick this is amazing so proud about one thing I want to change you see how this model actually gets squished well we're gonna make the change that you know whenever you get to a small screen you just remove it now to remove it again how do we do the last time we're also going to use a media query it's just how we did the last time right and with media queries it's pretty simple you just do like this try this out so on the menu group and the menu on the menu right here so we'll say what media again Max with RS 768 pixels meaning basically when we get to 768 pixels browser wood we say display none on the full thing so save that boom right there see oh let's go boom now What's Happening Here you see that shop Tesla account for some reason is doing this thing where it's like going all the way to the left hand side and we can fix that by what go into the container and currently we say align item Center but to make them space out we say justify content content and then we'll just space between that's it beat win there we go look at that oh oh oh oh yeah there we go so beautiful I love it so how cool is this guys huh that's pretty pretty amazing 883 likes guys you guys are amazing 900. let's go okay so that is all good that's cool good all right the next I want to focus on is you know how inside if I refresh this page it has like this really slick animation and it's pretty cool I kind of like it you guys want to install the animation I think so too so how do we make this animation works it's gonna usually called react reveal check this out react reveal and all this is just a module it's basically just a module for react uh for animation Library you see look at this pretty much anything you want I mean we can even use different effects if you if you wanted to there's a zoom effect and so to create actually add a fade effect it's pretty simple you just you know you install react reveal like so right and then you do what then you do basically you add not zoom but you do see where's the fade I want to do Fade home fade fate fate fate fade effect there we go with their fade left you know you just give the Fate that's pretty much it that's it see that's all happens so let's go ahead and make that one work that's pretty cool um if I have my Model S here no matter why yeah that's cool all right so open up in terminal right here and let's do yarn add yarn add and what react reveal let's see one more time tutorials instructions react reveal right here react reveal so you want to add react reveal boom adding that to the react good good good beautiful nice okay all right now that that's happening oh it's gonna happen now at this point let's go back to our react reveal let's go into the fade effect we need to import the fade right here so import fade okay let's go and import fade here um this is the the let's go ahead this needs to be done on this section so import fade here two two two two boom and all we need to do is now just basically you know group the fade of what you wanted to fade it's as simple as that right so here's what I'll do on the item text I will say the following I will say fade where is it is it I will say here fade it I'm so faded fade bottom from the bottom boom and I will give it a round this could be around the item text boom okay let's see it now oh how good is this check this one out guys all right I like that next let's go ahead and do around the bun group right here so do the following so we'll do Fade same thing also bottom boom Tata oh God oh yeah oh you oh so good so good so good oh my God I love this this is so good oh I love that that animation is so good I mean who doesn't come on guys come on come here come on give me a break come on how good is this huh how good does this look I mean if you're not great I don't know what's going on with you you know so I'm getting very close Okay the next thing I want to start working on a work on is gonna be what is going to be the actual um kind of sidebar right so the sidebar that kind of comes up from here when I click on this we need to have a sidebar that comes up on the right hand side okay um so let's make that one happen sidebar is what's called a burger nav menu and for now let's go just let's go ahead and just create a program menu and that will be done so the hair.js right there so let's do this so Burger nav okay and this one will just have a bunch of like for example like items so here are the items that they should look like so we'll create a few items like this for example we'll say we'll use uh a Light Element so we'll say Li like this and we'll give an attack so we'll say a a schref is equal to nothing so far okay nothing so far but inside there for example we have things like existing inventory inventory right we also thinks that it's going to copy this right here so command C command V commit uh command V Command right uh we have a few different things that we're gonna say so invest in this inventory we have used inventory right so for example use inventory we have for example trade in right trade uh trade Dash in you know and so forth and so forth let's go ahead and maybe modify some of these right here maybe oh the Cyber truck who's excited for that one cyber truck right here there's maybe The Roaster that's gonna be pretty cool one too right there and so what we're building right now is pretty much the following right if we're building this menu boom this menu on the right hand side that's our building right there oh this one on the right hand side everything else will build now we just need to go and focus on that one okay uh you can see these were the model X use inventory that's just pretty much those items right there all right awesome sweet so we got that portion that's all good um and the burger nav of course not existing right now so we need to create that so let's say const const what const Burger nav Burger now is equal to what Burger nav is equal to style dot div Tata right there all right oh that looks hideous don't worry about it guys okay so don't worry about this so the Burger now right now uh let's go ahead and do the following we'll just put it on top of everything else that's that's kind of needed all right um so for one it's gonna be position fixed so position fixed why because it's always in the top no matter what right it's always going to be where on the right hand side right always going to be here no matter what page you're on okay so business fixed now where I'm going to say top zero right I'm going to say bottoms here to stretch it only the bottom and then I'm going to say write zero that will take it all the way to the right hand side boom okay so now it's on the right hand zero good next all right at this point let's go into background color back background white nice you see so it's kind of getting there a little bit all right so it's background white let's give it a width width of 300 pixels good nice okay I like it good good let's also give it a z index because obviously it's like kind of like I think it's kind of like the index so the Z index is like 10 100. let's see is it 100 um I think it's because in that case we need to go ahead and make everything else is the index of smaller that's what we need to do in that case so that means that everything else oh man that's a lot gosh darn it okay so the whole section now let's do this let's go to section how and this right here will say Z index index of 10 let's just say will that change anything because I want this to be on top you see what I mean I want it to be on top is what I'm trying to get to let's think about it here the index 10 that's going to be maybe negative one negative one no that's not it the index of let's just say the index of 10 . so what's what's being overwritten so let's see okay let's see let's see let's see let's see so ball for one is the item text so I think we need to focus on item text here so let's do item text let's do this one it's going to be Z index it's gonna be 10. come on give me something um so item tax C next minus one does that mean the home just had needs to have a smaller Z index I'm just trying to think here guys what do you guys think here so home maybe this is going to be easy index of 10 maybe no did not change nothing okay let's see how do we go ahead and make sure that this kind of works the way I wanted to so Z index of 10 what do you guys think have any suggestions and we have any suggestions some said refresh no home 10 it's Max but do 10 for sidebar okay so for sidebar let's try that for the header for the whole Burger nav let's try that I mean I can't do anything like let's see still not nothing how do we fix the Z index issue the index of let's try this the Innes of 16. I'm just thinking here let's see easy index oh maybe it's this so it contains really let's see if I go to here and I say this container is z index of one oh what the heck oh that makes sense oh so we actually so it was competing the weight was competing not with everything else it was actually competing with the actual header which is the container which is above it because this remember this broken app is within this so in order to have this show up above this the container I'm going to give this a small Z index and give this one a z next like 16 they say okay that makes sense okay so there we go all right so cool we kind of got that that's pretty awesome I kind of like that won't you agree okay so now let's go ahead and focus on we have the index okay let's do the burger now and top zero width that's good that's good now okay let's go and remove this list out because it's horrible Let's test Style it'll be none okay good next let's do padding 20 pixels to give it some padding all around good nice nice nice nice nice nice okay 20 pixels then let's go ahead and do the following then we'll do a background no no no so the list style is kind of like not the way I wanted to because why because it's centered which is not what I like so to make that work I just do display Flex on this one this place of display Flex on this puppy there you go good and then we'll do fly version column good ah it's still okay don't worry and then uh we'll do what to flex um justify content justify content a flex start good oh like this let's justify content like really come on really nothing is a text online text align what start okay never mind you don't need this livestretation column that case I mean that could still be useful actually oh we don't need this one so attacks the line start which is good which I like okay uh let's see where are we at so on this one we have model three Model S okay I like that so now let's go ahead and focus on each line so Li okay so a lie on this one we'll do the following and this all I will do so we'll have padding top and bottom padding 15 pixels for every single one and then left and right is gonna be zero for now okay and we'll give it a border bottom boom right there good okay good and then we'll give it an a tag so on the let's go ahead and see let's see now oh let's go that looks good that looks good okay I like it I like it I like it let's go ahead and give it and the etag let's just give it a more of a font weight so we'll do font weight wait font weight by the way we're almost at a thousand likes guys come on let's get this party started fund weight 600 good a let's go now of course now the thing we need to work on is how do you actually make it work so that it actually shows up properly you know what I mean because right now it's just kind of there right so right now it's just kind of there um yeah it's top right bottom zero you know and we just hide it somehow so how do we hide it well for one let's go ahead and add an x button so in a material UI icons let's go and find material icons let's do material UI icons material and let's find an x button X there we go close okay good exactly what we want So Close icon all right like oh look how good this look guys oh my God it's so good okay let's go ahead and input our close button here okay so inside the burger nav we'll create we'll actually go ahead and do this close button right here oops oops so we'll do um we'll do what Custom Clothes so we'll say this custom close custom close so it's going to create a custom close button and how we're gonna do that well by using stock components so let's go here const custom close is equal to what styled no start what you see style close icon right there there we go close icon nice okay good good I like it okay uh allowed me to actually make sure this one gets aligned not there but actually somewhere else so to do this one we'll do let's see let's see let's see just kind of thinking here and this one um we need to wrap it in that case so let's do we'll create a closed wrapper clothes wrapper because we need to actually shift this to the right hand side right so if I go ahead and do it this way so again this is Bishop to here right we need to put that here in order to shift that properly how is it going to work well to shift it properly right I'm going to create a div around it a wrapper and then display Flex it and put it here that's I'm going to create it okay just so you know and that's a pretty good way of doing this kind of stuff right so just so you know custom close okay so if you want to like align something remember this rule wrap it if you want to align something wrap it you need to there's always needs to be a parent wrapper in order to align something vertically horizontally left right whatever it might have to be right okay close wrapper let's go ahead and create that color wrap right here okay so close wrapper so const close wrapper is equal to styled dot div now look at this one now you see check this one out okay all I do at this point is very simple I say the following I say display Flex flex and here's what I do check this one out okay let's play flex and we'll say um justify content content what Flex end boom right there see just as simple as that that's it and now that's there okay next up let's go ahead and do the following we'll do um let's do on the actual custom close we'll do what cursor pointer pointer save that nice right there there we go beautiful beautiful good good good good good good awesome sweet look at this oh my gosh this looks good guys this looks so good all right who's still with me you guys still with me I hope so let's go all right all right so we got this portion now we need to figure out how do we close it well we're going to use use state to make sure that we understand when is there when there is a closing factor or when there's an open Factor right so for example um let's go and do this let's use your state to figure out when I click on this I'm going to trigger a you state to say Hey you know close it right if I open it I'm going to say that we have an open State now that's what's going to happen now okay so let's do this I'm going to say you stay it's going to open import you state here you state beautiful okay all right nice nice nice nice and at this point you as few a few very simple things okay this is so clean guys by the way such such a such clean code which I really love by the way all right so we have you state and the side here is the following boom and we'll do const here I'm going to create our use state so we'll say Burger uh status of a burger I'll say open Burger open or set I'll just say Burger status I think it's good I kind of like that one status right there and with a sad Burger status a burger Stat or this right there it's equal to what use State and this will set it to false so we're now right now it's actually closed so story status is closed but there right so that's what's gonna happen Okay so recess is closed now how do you go ahead and make sure that you know that this stuff is actually closed or open well very simple is what we can do is the following so look at this on the burger nav I'm going to pass an error wrapper here I'll pass in a parameter here and this can be show is equal to the status of the burger status say Burger status Burger status right there I guess that is inside the burger now Burger now all I'm going to do is check this one out I'm going to say for example here um if we have so look at this one I'm going to transform it so I'm going to say transform check this one out transform okay I'm going to look at the props or props like so what about this I've done before and basically here's what we'll say if if it says prop star show perhaps.show right it basically says perhaps a show we're going to do what transform you know nothing so here's what we'll do we'll do even says props.show we'll just make it you know show basically um translate x0 so here's what we'll do so Translate translate X it would need to be like this right here translate X 0. and what does that do so if I go to translate X go ahead and do it this way otherwise we'll do translate x 100 percent Translate X 100 percent okay okay let's see so right now it's false okay oh now it's false Okay so what just happened let me see and make sure it's all good let me see I think I need to actually hey let's go so now now look you see so right now translate X basically if it's show we have translate x0 so translate x what does that what does that pretty much do um Let Me Go and show it to you Tran this is late X right here look at this one guys this is pretty cool right so I can move something basically so right here for example I can translate x 10 pixels I'm gonna translate 10 pixels to the right hand side right and so what's going to happen is is the following if I go ahead and actually if I do for example if I do show and I say here a hundred percent boom let's go and see this see this see this prop Style Show isn't working at all let's see am I missing something um probably show should be false if it's false I think it should be translate zero yes yes yes yes yes there you go so let's get this out so this will do if props that show basically you could not proper show is false right now of course so what's going to happen is it's going to translate what zero it won't move it at all right right so that's gonna happen if it's false it won't move it at all that's that's that's that's kind of what happened of course but we need to say this if it's false what happens actually if it's true if it's if we say props.show right then we actually need to move it not nothing because basically we do nothing right so if it's true we don't do nothing to this right this stays the way you should be right but the second is false this is false we need to move to the right hand side it's full width right here see that's why he shows it that way now check this out what we can do now at this point is we can have another click so when I go ahead and I click open so this com unclick button so unclick unclick is equal to what right I'm gonna say uh right well I'm gonna say what I'm going to do the following I'm gonna say sadbroker status to true that is too true so set it to true okay true so means if I click on this on you icon set the progress status to be true minions mini open so let's try this for now oh look at that see that means open right there how cool is that so that means open okay now close is now work right now because of course close is nothing right so now to actually change that to make that fully happen what to do on the on the click of this one what we're going to say is equal to what boom boom will say what status what cyberger status to what to false there we go look at this now right so now we change it to false if I do this oh how cool is this Guys burger status is now officially what officially now true or false now again this is where we now make it very beautiful look at this one let's go ahead and make it very beautiful now okay guys how good is it starting to look aren't you aren't you pumped aren't you like like excited for this and by the way we're almost at a thousand likes guys 977. let's go ahead and make sure we have that you know let's get to 1K it's not that much come on you guys got it's been working really hard now um all right so that's good 977 likes let's go all right to make it flow very nicely we just add a small transition to it check this out you see this transform all I do is look transition I say the following transition transition and I do what on the transform Factor Traditions form and I will say what 0.2 seconds and I'm going to say ease in right now your wife it is my friend are you ready for the reveal all right oh foreign look at that boom boom boom boom boom I kind of want to make it even better though I kind of want to make it look even better let me see let's see I want to say ease in ease out I wouldn't say easing ease dash out I don't like that better knock here oh that's not it hold on um let's see there we go much better I like oh let's go that looks so good how cool is that guys let's go ahead and give us a thumbs up for the following and we're at a thousand likes you guys are amazing as always just want to say something easy now thank you hey let's go oh how cool is that beautiful it looks so good okay now let's go ahead and actually add something to this right we're gonna add some Redux to this all right but pretty much look at this we're almost pretty much done we're so close to finishing this a Tesla clone uh it's so clean the coat is clean that's the really cool part about this all right um a few things now we're going to do is the following let's go ahead and add some data to it about like our cars right so as you can see here we have for example you know we might have cars for example car titles so here for example Model S and so forth right Model S model 3 Model Model Y and and so forth now let's go ahead and create uh our Redux store that will contain the cars that we will be using here okay we'll be using here so here's what we'll do let's go ahead and look at the Redix the component that we need to create so let's go features and the one that we have currently is like a weird one that's like a counter feature we don't need that one at all so we can actually fix that one but that's the hand side we can't fix that one um don't need the counter instead of go ahead and create new folder on the features folder and let's call it for example car slice car slice right there okay counter you can remove that one so let's go ahead right click um delete move to trash now we only just have car slice because that's the only thing we need so inside the car so it's gonna create a new file and what actually no Let's do let's see uh let's rename this to car rename this to car not car slice car and inside here we'll create new file called car slice car slice.js beautiful okay all right let's go to our app go to store and I've removed this counter reducer because we don't need that one okay okay good on the counter slice on the car slice all right we need to of course import Redux toolkit so let's go ahead and read the import Redux toolkit for create slice and what slice is basically in Redux is Imagine remix is like this whole state of data that you have right imagine Redux is like for example you know where this is this whole state right and a slice is just one smaller state right one small one piece of a state so in our case our slice will be for example just car for now and that's why it's called slices right it's like a slight slice of pizza right and every single for example when you're trying to save data in the global state of the whole website right you might have a car slice you might have an inventory slice who know for example right inventory you know and so forth and so forth and all that is just data shared across all your web pages websites all your pages on your site that's pretty much it okay so let me create a slice that's what's Happening Here all right beautiful let's go ahead and go next the next one we'll go ahead and do is we've got the car sliced that's great um let's create the initial state so we'll do const initial State and we'll give it a few cards so we'll say um cars I'm giving the cars right here and this will be actually an array of objects X just actually just honestly just an array of cards so say for example model which one what do we have Model S model 3 right Model S model 3 Model X model y so Model S Model S model three okay Model X Model X and then model y oh model y there we go all right so we got ourselves the cars okay um let's go ahead and now get this car so to create the actual slice we'll do const car slice car slice is equal to what's going to create the slides right we're creating a slice of pizza right create slice right there and that takes a few different things the amount we're going to name it as name the slice right there this could be car for now okay and then we'll give an initial state and initial state right there okay and then we'll give a few reduces now we don't need any reduces at this point right because our goal right now is just to get the cars that's it so we don't need anything like that of that sort that's way too complicated instead but instead will what we will however do is we'll get the cards themselves so we'll say export const and the trajectory or how usually you do it inside slices inside windows toolkit is you for example do select so it's like selecting a piece of object selecting a piece of data so in that case I'm selecting cars right here okay is equal to what is equal to state it's a good State and then it's gonna return to me let's turn to be the state that car the car is the name of the slides right here dot cars that's it and that's going to be this right here that's with this whole array that's pretty much it okay so this right here is mapping directly to this right here and Select Cars will have that for us that's it and of course we're going to export now default uh we could ask for the reducer because we need to actually export some kind of reducer even though it's empty default and we'll say car slice dot reducer beautiful nice all right once we've got that we need to actually import this so let's go ahead and go to store and we'll do import and this will be the car reducer so we'll say car car reducer right here from what okay when you go back then we need to go into features let me go ahead let me see this I need to go back let me go into features right here after that we need to go into the car right there car let me go car slice beautiful right there and so inside of this kind of reducer we just change it to car reducer car is going to be car reducer right there right so that's pretty much all you have to do on the Redux reducer side okay so just keep that in mind always okay guys uh you know the store you you tell what producers you have okay the slice is basically every individual reducer you can see right individual slice and this contains the actions and I'm not gonna go into go deep into redex of course that there will be another video of itself um but it Redux there's always a few different things we also have we always have the initial State that's a state that you will have when you initially start the application and you will have reducers and reduce strategies just functions you can use to manipulate the state maybe you have a function that will add a new car you know or something something else so that's what kind of the Redux reducer is there for right there's also actions but we'll talk about those later most important thing is the fact that we have Select Cars which will get us the cars individually okay nice okay so all right at this point we are pretty much almost done let's go to home.js and what we need to do is the following it's got a section here section here uh no actually not here header right here we're going to import our car slice so so let's go import okay I will say Select Cars right this will get us the actual car select cars from from what from features right here slash car slash car slice good and we need to actually import your selector so in order to select something that usually something called use selector which is a hook which is a react hook right here oh God right here so you selector and then we're going to select the actual card so we'll say const cars is equal to what use selector from what well Select Cars boom done you see that's it right we've started the cars from the actual you selector right so if we're in a consult login let's go to consult a load the cars cars okay console login right now let's go ahead and right click inspect them on this one console uh let's go ahead and see how this works out let's go ahead and refresh it says Legacy Collins API has been detected within the strict mode tree don't worry about this one but look at this here it is Model S model 3 Model X model y beautiful that's all we need to Do's I see this is some fade stuff we don't need to do this one should mitigate to the new version the old API will be 24 that's fine right so right there here's our array and now all we do is for example for this which so now here as we'll do if cars cars and and cars dot map right gonna get the individual car and then we're gonna get the index boom done all right and took automatic index and then that's going to give us what okay good so then I will go ahead and do a Shroff Doom right here I will give it some kind of a thing like this okay that closes that beautiful there we go so Model S okay now check this out all we gotta do now at this point is just be give it a car oops car and I can remove this now done so now let's see oh let's go another thing we want to figure out is give the key so because if I right click the Spectrum on this one go to console here see it says each child in the list should have a unique key the reason why they do that is because um react actually tracks individual Child by the key so let's say any changes happened it will not work to make those changes I'm curious about using the index like this right there see so if I inspect them by now okay the console and let's go ahead I refresh this again see the child is no longer that issue is no longer there beautiful let's remove this console of cars guys we're almost done so close to being done and finishing up this Tesla clone that is pretty pretty insane I will say all right and the next thing I'm going to do is we'll do the same thing with this specific situation here with this cars and I'll put in here cars are map but in my case I'm going to use it like this boom and this will be the actual car itself car right there and again a lie and I'm going to give it a key is equal to the actual index boom boom boom boom boom don't need any of this stuff boom right here that's it that's it and so this is gonna be that let's go ahead and take a look at that one so cars.map so let's go see oh oh would you look at that oh guys look at what we have got for ourselves let's go ahead and do add and that's gonna be uh Redux for cars right there good yes good be a look at what we have got for ourselves oh my God look at that guys look at this Model S model three we have some beautiful animations look at that oh my God accessories all this stuff and if you compare it to an actual Tesla page I mean let's go ahead and take a look at the Tesla page actual Tesla page let's take a look at it here look at that like what like okay just compare it here like hold on look look like what guys do you see the magic that we have just done like can you tell the difference I mean yes we have this fancy feature like the scrolling feature we can work on that later but look it's there I actually hate I actually hate this kind of um features of like where they you know they don't allow you to scroll I hate that oh let's go look at oh my God how good is this guys this is So Fresh So Clean You Know It uh guys that is pretty pretty insane wow wow wow looking dope Nas Jessica's dope that's awesome sweet howdy hello Colleen let's go let's go beautiful so what we've got like I said we've got everything we finished the application it looks so good it looks clean Model S model y model 3 Model X guys you put this on your portfolio it's gonna be a winning portfolio for yourself this is going to be a winning portfolio put this on your portfolio you're going to just it's going to be so good that's all I can tell you all right look at that oh my God yes oh my God it's so good that's so beautiful guys that's pretty much it for me uh hope you guys enjoyed the build like I said guys if you're interested in actually joining the boot camp and enjoying the boot can actually become a developer link is down below in description to go home and reserve your seat all it is is you just put in a small deposit just to go ahead and join the boot camp more information about The Bootcamp is on cleverpro.com you know uh on cloudpro.com which is actually right here if you go to Claire black cleverprogram.com let's go and see this right here go to coding bootcamp and you'll you can learn more about the Kony boot camp right here right so we've been at this for quite a while some of our some of our instructors and students have joined so many amazing companies look at this right and so forth so if you're interested go ahead and check this out and then you click the link below to go ahead and put in your and reserve your seat like I said see reservations close very very soon actually by June 1st we have reservations closing so you won't be able to join anymore at this point um but that's it from me in that case hope you guys have an amazing day let me see how you guys are doing let me go ahead and comment with you guys show astrology yes everybody says show us okay sure I can show that no problem GS so the GS resists of the GS right there that's it there's nothing crazy about this guy stole the GS that's it that's it storage right here like this car reducer that's all it is you have to import the reducer right here and then set it right there that's all you gotta do okay that's pretty much it guys and look at this by the way I don't know if you guys see this but this is also uh oh this is the actual Tesla phone this is actually also like user friendly too not user friendly but mobile friendly as well which is pretty insane looks so good so good guys who think this was an amazing build who enjoyed it let me know thumbs up of the video If you enjoyed this specific build I sure did I really did actually it was really really good it was really good let me see what are you guys saying here all right nice there's a building for Jingle clone that's gonna happen that's definitely sweetness thank you awesome Adrian I'm happy you enjoyed it Nas let's go Muhammad let's go super thanks guys awesome sweet thank you thank you thank you Lewis at elbow cough that's awesome uh but before you yes I do mean GitHub put this on your GitHub put in your portfolio because some people you might have portfolios where you showcase the actual application so definitely put that there let's see super clean super fancy I agree with that nice nice nice nice nice now let's go nice let's go luik is currently in a full stack Mastery let's go hey hey let's go look I love you too bro super clean now that's what I'm talking about but there's two kids that's actually an import that's going to take a look at this on google.com it's an import guys it's a new way to do Redux it's pretty awesome thank you so much I'm not number one fan oh let's go Daniel okay thank you I'm your fan I'm your number one fan number two maybe number two fan oh my God all right guys that's it from me uh hope you guys have a great day and I'll see you in the next video Disney plus phone with react.js that's what we're doing today look at this Disney plus that we have right now as you can see look at this let me put this making this full screen this is a beautiful uh that we we're going to build we're going to use Firebase we're going to use Redux we're going to use reactor Dom we're going to use let me see what else are we going to use we're going to use things like you know a react slick to be able to create this slick animation right here right uh so many different things we're going to use style components all is going to be used here okay and of course we're gonna be using vs code for to be able to build this look at all these animations if I go ahead and click on this I can sign out beautiful and then I can click login to log in again with my this is by the way using Firebase authentication so I can log in like this but oh we're set we're set hello YouTube Hello everybody I hope you guys are doing great all right so let's go actually get this party started let's get it straight into it um so a few things we need to do to go ahead and get the start like I said this is going to be a very detailed build we might split this up into two parts but this is how we're going to do it all right beautiful all right okay so now at this point what we need to do is the first things first is let's go ahead and build out our actual project by starting up a you know project using react so the opportunity to do of course for this you need a node.js so the first thing you need to do is you need to install node.js hopefully you have that by now so node.js right here very very important right that's gonna be what you need that's node.js all right so make sure you install the recommended version okay once you've got that of course you need to install pretty much this we use code and once you're done with that you're pretty much all set okay all right sweet sweet so let's go ahead and open up our finder or uh something where we go ahead and actually open up a folder I'm gonna go ahead new finder here new finder uh new finder window hopefully I can find it here where's my viewfinder window right there all right and now we'll go have a GitHub folder here right here and this is called Nas and I'm going to do new Services New terminal at folder so I'm going to open up a new terminal folder if you're in Windows you might have to do it differently you might have to use your terminal kind of like on windows so what I will do on this point is I will say type in MPX create create I'm gonna go ahead and make this a little bit bigger so you can you can all see it npx npx create dash dash react react Dash app dash dash template Redux right so we're going to use Redux for this specific application note so npx create react app dash dash template Redux is what you need to do so click enter on this one to see all options please specify the project I need to okay so the issue is are you specify the project name here so NPS queer react app and we're going to call it Disney Disney Plus Dash clone right here so npx career react app Disney plus clone dash dash template Redux hit enter all right that's all going doing so what's happening here is very simple guys okay what's going on is basically it's building all the scripts it's building it's initializing a the first project for us uh in order to be able to do something like this and of course hello YouTube Hello everybody I see all of you guys well we have a 20 donation from on let's go beautiful thank you so much um that is amazing let me go ahead and highlight highlight you on here where are you where are you where are you where are you oh whoa let's go beautiful thank you thank you appreciate it because of clever programmer I made over 100k a year thank you on appreciate it yeah he joined us actually uh he joined clever programmer a while ago and actually joined our boot camp and he was able to make a lot of a basically a Sunday key job and then make up more money from other jobs as well so pretty pretty insane all right now at this point that's that's it so what we've done here is we've created our project it was happy hacking once it says happy hacking you're pretty much done okay I'm gonna put up some music here so we can all be listening to a little bit of music while we're coding all right so happy hacking beautiful all right at this point what we need to do is you see how it created this folder called Disney plus clone right here and all we need to do is very simple we need to go ahead and open this up and we use code all right so let me put this use code on here on the right hand side and of course hopefully you can do this by your with by yourself as well that that all right I'm gonna open up a new new window with vs code there we go beautiful that's the new window just opened up I will do file open and then go to my ticket hub go to NAS here and then the one that we just did is what the Disney plus clone that's the one that we just opened up so let's go ahead and do that right now beautiful all right sweet all right and here's what we got now so right this is the project that we start out with with or basically react GS you can see we have source and there's a few files that you need to pay attention to the the one file that you need to really really pay attention to is kind of like uh well this one right here is we have app.js that's kind of like your main file right here and what we can do is if we do go ahead and do let's do right click on the yarn.lock and then say open inside integrate terminal right here and then do npm npm start boom npm starts to click npm Start beautiful that will start up your project guys okay that will set up your project and now at this point you should see it right here oh let's go this is our first react JS project reactor JS project okay of course you can click you can hit plus right here to add add it you can hit minus and the way it's working it's working with Redux is because we're able to for example click plus and minus with Redux right and Redux is a way to roster Save State and we'll talk about how that's done later on a little bit okay so subtract number three two one Z and so forth that's pretty awesome all right so this is our first project right here and what we need to do is very simple at this point is let's do some cleanup okay that's part one all right in terms of cleanup let me go ahead and make this right here uh at that JS don't really need anything here now just remove that sign out of baby let's go that's done all right save that that's what I'm talking about all right okay that's what I'm talking about so we don't need that all right so now it's clean right and I can type with whatever whatever I want in here so I'll say hello boom right if I say hello okay so really just anything I kind of want all right A5 for example look at these other things uh we have 300 views 300 people on YouTube Hold up what's up what's up what's up amazing to have all of you guys here as always as always okay beautiful hello hello hello great travel creation always helps me somebody somebody said all right so that's if I say hello here you can see we have hello on here next up let's go and clean up some CSS here um at that CSS just command a don't need none of this all right save it don't need none of this it's all I'm not going to say useless but it's unnecessary for us okay so that's done uh test.gs don't need any of this do remove delete this one right here too move to trash okay do not need that okay uh next thing logo you see this logo import logo from logo SVG don't need this either boom right here okay do not need that okay and that's pretty much it next up let me see next up let me see uh I will go ahead and do the following is let me go ahead and do this so we have that next up let's put you see how we have this counter we don't need this counter as well so that's not too more important local SVG remove this one unnecessary all right and now we have a pretty clean clean app now what I want to do is let's go ahead and create components all right I'm going to create new folder here I'm going to create a components folder right so the reason why we like to do that is because just it makes things so much simpler right so and just create a components folder and that's over all of your components will live now let's really think about how are we going to build this application right this application contains a lot of different aspects all right let's think about what it needs for us to actually build this um a few things as you can see here that part one is we kind of have the header right here that's part one and I'll always like to think about the structure of you know anything that I'm building so for example um if I do this so this right here is my header okay so I know that I need to build a header that's part one part two I need to go ahead and build a slider that's going to be another component I need to go ahead and create okay that's part two part three is I'm going to basically then build up this right here this viewer it's called a viewer right that's going to be what we will do with that so that's another component after that what we'll go ahead and do is we'll build this movies list that's going to be a third component and so what now has happened is we've just divided our application into multiple components right and this is how every single app works or basically on you know uh that's how every single app kind of works you know when we're going to build it in react.js honestly any app you're going to build online so let's see it so these are the coupons we want to build let's actually go ahead and build them right here now we know there's multiple Pages for here inside the app.js we'll create a component called header right here and this looks like a div but really it's kind of like it's a component so pretty much it is a div but it's a div that contains another component and what I will do is I will create a file inside click the components folder and I will say header.js that JS boom right there then what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the es7 code Snippets which hopefully you have when you install extensions which is this one right here you see esm react code Snippets right there right see esm red code Snippets right here hopefully you install that at this point and once you've done that if I click on here.js which is the one the file I created I will do rfce right and you can see this is our app.js so we have the header component inside here now that we've done that let's type in header in here so save that go to app.js and what's going to happen now at this point is well we need to import the header so I'm going to say import header from from what well from components folder from the components folder so I will do like this components Dash header done components Dash header okay I will go ahead and save this now at this point all right and once I've done that if if I look at my app look at that it says header right there had it right that is the header right so we've just created the header component using this okay all right beautiful now let's go to head.js and inside here we're going to use style component now what style components are basically CSS within JavaScript all right let's try this out um to use style components what I'm going to do is actually install them first so let's go ahead and do do Plus on our integrate terminal right here now we'll do the following npm install styled Dash components style Dash componentials done beautiful awesome style Dash components okay so this installed it is installed the components okay that's awesome there we go beautiful that's amazing and then what are we going to do now this point is we need to import it now right so I'm going to import styled from styled styled Dash comp styled Dash components beautiful awesome import style from the side dish components save that save that and look here's what we can do now check this out remember how we had this deal right remember this dip well I can replace this deal with it with actually a basically like a style component so check this out container our name is to container like so right to literally container right here right and you see it says container is not defined no problem whatsoever we'll fix it in a second here so I'm going to say now this point the following const container container is equal to styled dot div so really we're creating a div with JavaScript you see instead of saying div here we're saying container so we name it whatever we want but then we create a style.dip now check this out what can we do with that well a few things we can give it a height so let's give it a height for example let's give it a height height of let's say for example 70 pixels 70 pixels okay save that all right and then let's get the background color so I'm gonna say background background color and I'm going to give it this color right here and you know I want you guys to copy this as well by yourself okay so this is 0 9 0 b 1 3 that's hashtag right there all right save that beautiful and so for look at this right here boom look the header is created is pretty much created you see the header is now created right here which directly maps to just this container that's all all we literally had to do that's all we had to do right that's all we had to do okay beautiful all right next up once we've done that so that's in the background color right all right so let's go ahead and save this background color so that's in the header okay beautiful next up is the format it's going to now create another component called home now what is the home well the home will be this portion which is this whole thing right well called home component right right why we're going to call home component what do you think we're going why do you think we're going to call the Home component like let me know in the comments below right it's because we have multiple Pages we have a home page we have a you know a login page and we have a detail page when I click on a detail I have a detail page as well and so that's what we're going to call home inside components new file let's create home home.gs boom right there beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful so that's that's our home.js let's do rfce again and again if you don't have RFC just kind of copy this portion right here to your terminal uh to enter your vs code okay and that's going to call this home boom right there awesome Okay add that GS let's import home of course we need to import it the cool thing about react.js is you can Import and Export things right just kind of how you you Import and Export with you know with trucks and you know in real life it's the same thing we can export just how you see if you go to home.gs you see you export a function or a component right you export it right here and then inside app.js we import it so I'm going to say here home from pom pom components Dash what which one do you think would do home right that's the one we're going to create beautiful all right next thing we're going to do is put the home inside here boom right there all right all right beautiful so let's go ahead and save this one all right I like it I like it I like it and if you go to home.js we'll call it home so really if we go to our react app boom we have home right here right now bars here home is here awesome all right so part one let's focus on just the header for now right our goal is to get to a hair that looks pretty much just kind of like this pretty much just kind of like this right here okay let's go just kind of like this all right so what are we going to do inside here well a few things right let's go and divide this up into a few different things well we have here this is the everything about this the divs is we have this is a div this is an image and now we have a connect menu portion right here right and then we call this a nav menu and then this is going to be like um a profile image right here so pretty much we're thinking about three divs that we need to go ahead and create beautiful all right three dips let's think about this now inside here in terms of container I'm actually going to change this name to not be container about I want you just to be nav so nav and by the way to actually make it happen to the cell you see how I just added it at the same time here's a cool trick click command d in vs code or Ctrl D and it will select all these things automatically for you and you just change on the Fly see for example let me see see it changes everything in the flight how cool is that huh give me a thumbs up if you think if you think that's cool give me a thumbs up thinking that thing that if you think if you think that's awesome I think it's pretty cool yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah all right there we go beautiful beautiful sweet all right so now instead of doing style that div I'm going to do style.now so it's going to be navigation bar and that's just a little more user friendly with HTML5 that's pretty much the reason why once we've done that let's go ahead and do the following um well let's go ahead and create our actual logo so I'm going to create a logo here logo again it's going also going to be style component source with a certain image no image just yet okay okay logo let's go ahead and do this const const logo right const logo style the image logo right there of equals oh styled dot image right there that's an image right again and again these quotes right here these quote this code are called template little pretty much or I call backticks and this is where we put our CSS inside here all right beautiful and then aside here we're going to give it a width of width of 80 pixels so width 80 pixels all right now with now with guys okay with I'm not the best uh you know I'm not the best typer I will say that with 80 pixels okay all right so so we have the logo I can see there's nothing again does not show up on here but here's what we can do all right now let's go ahead and focus on the nav menu all right so we have the nav menu here nav menu let's create this other component now menu nav menu and we're going to create it into a div so it's the same thing here you see the cool thing about style components is that I'm creating CSS within the actual Javascript file I'll have to go back and forth between two files nav menu equals styled dot div done Zone done all right that's awesome okay no error so far now how do we go ahead and get this image a logo okay now um David or amanath hopefully we have a link down in the description basically towards a folder that has an images folder and you should be able to download that folder and maybe a month a day but you can go ahead and send it to me can you send it to me on uh slack or something like that maybe David you can send to me on slack the Axel the actual um um yeah then also I've dropped it into Zoom chats thank you so I'm gonna drop in the zoom chat for those of you guys who are on Youtube it'll be down description uh below okay and of course for those of you who cannot keep up right now don't worry you'll be able to watch this back for sure right this is a recording recorded uh you know coaching call kind of right uh we'll be able to rewatch there's no problem so if you cannot keep up with this no problem whatsoever if you can all the best to you right that's thumbs up but if you cannot don't worry right just watch it's about kind of understanding by the there's a lot that you will actually learn here just by watching and then once you watch just basically rewatch it a few times later on and then um you know and then do it by yourself kind of maybe after we finish this uh coaching call okay we'll finish this live right so there's a folder right here I'm going to open this one up for you guys all right this should be down in the description go and do this all right this is the folder done description or down the zoom chat just hitting that one okay there we go and this has all the images and all the videos and there's also like a Javascript file as well we will be using that tomorrow actually not so much today what I want you guys to do is download this one so download this one so let's see you're zipping up right now good good good good good and like I said if you cannot keep up just rewatch this video and you know just do your best that's it it's about having fun and enjoying the build with us okay all right all right beautiful all right let's go and continue on so it go ahead it will download it that's exactly what I want all right I'm going to open this up in my finder window let me see let me find it let me find it downloads and see downloads downloads downloads downloads two to two Okay I'm going to unzip it so this is the one that's downloaded I'm going to unzip and this is what I have you see these images right here and so what I want you to do is simply you know where to put it here's where I want you to put it so take out these images you see this images folder you need to put it inside the public folder right here inside the public folder right that's where you need to put that okay let me go ahead and try that but not just images appreciate yourself let me see no we don't need just images I actually need everything hold on because I did not download everything let me see I'll make sure done with everything Drive oh I only download the images I should download the whole thing download the whole thing that's what I should have done right there see I only select the images but that's okay download the whole thing here all right okay good good good good good good good all right awesome sweet and I'll open this up again and finder all right downloads where is it downloads right here okay this is the one we want extract it I'm going to double click it here on Mac if you're on Windows just go ahead and click on as well just extract it okay beautiful all right so all these things I want you to select these things right here and just basically just move them move them into into the public folder so these videos and images these ones right into the public folder done okay now we have images inside here and the videos inside here all right that's it that is it that you need to do all right beautiful because all these images that we're going to use are they're all pretty much just here okay they should be inside the public folder right here as you can see public and images and videos right there all right hopefully you guys got that thumbs up if you guys got that yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes again the folder is in the description below okay description below all right let's go ahead and create the image all right so what what I need to do is this for the source it will actually be Dash images Dash logo Dash logo.svg Now where's it coming from you see images right here along with SVG directly from here from here right here okay that's where it's coming from all right all right let's go and save this one refresh boom right there we got the Disney plus logo just like that how cool is that right all right beautiful let's go ahead and maybe add some Panic to this you see how it's all the way on the top I don't like that instead what I'm going to do is I'm going to center it so to center it I'm actually going to focus on the main nav the nav is this whole div right here okay that's the whole nap and I'm going to tell a display Flex right so this playfi is going to allow us to very easily to very easily very easily structure our code our structure our front end display flex and so save that see that puts it right there and I'm going to say align item Center item Center to Center vertically boom see now it's under vertical right here I'm going to give some padding I'm going to say petting 036 pixels all right pending zero through it now what is all this zero means top and bottom this means zero pixels for top and bottom 36 bit so this means left and right padding okay that means left and right padding okay that's what that means all right so let's go ahead and save that all right beautiful that looks so much better now guys check this out that looks so good all right I love that so logo is there let's now focus on the nav menu that one is a little bit going to be trickier okay and that menu will have a few things okay the first thing will be is every single icon here that you see right every single icon what it is is basically this right here is an a tag this is an a tag and inside here we have a logo and a span tag so let's take a look at this oh if I say here for example if I say oop let's go remove this for a second here boom I'm going to say a right I'm going to give it a that logo you see which is this image right here right this image right here I'm going to say here image source is equal to beautiful and let's do it go to images Dash home icon home Dash icon dot SVG done okay all right and then let's go ahead and do a span here all right and we'll give it home done so a tag home so if I say this let's see what this turns out to oh it looks so horrible that's okay no problem with Summer okay so you see the icon is there which is great but of course you know the fact that home page is here the homepage we don't really see that's mainly because of the color right we need to give it a color that's that's pretty much wide all right so a few things that I want you guys to think about is the following let's go ahead and focus on this home icon partially the Span needs to be color white so to make a color white we need to go to the following let's make the whole thing color white what I mean by that is let's go to index.css all right and this body let's give the full color to be white see this one white right it makes this homepage now white see right there it just showed up just like that just like that beautiful all right now let's make this icon be the left side of this home icon right how do we structure from being like this to being like this right that's the question well it's very simple it's all using display Flex so I'm going to go back to my header I'm going to back to my header.js okay JS and I will say the following where am I where am I where am I okay yes no menu so here what I'm gonna do display Flex Part One display Flex on this all right now that's not really change anything here right it's still home is like this uh instead what I will do the following I will say a here you see and then here I will say display facts again the a we're targeting this a tag that's the link tag right so a will say display Flex display Flex awesome save that boom you see now this icon all of a sudden now it's very different it's left to right instead of top to bottom just simple that all right so that's good let me kind of make this all right beautiful right there okay that's the blue flags then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to align this time so I'm say align items items Center save it done you see now this home icon is centered right here together with the icon itself okay next up let's go and add some padding to it some say padding padding 0 12 pixels and what this does is this is going to add Paddy on the left and the right hand side okay beautiful next up let's do the image let's go ahead and change this image because it's way too large right this is this is our this image logo so in size style components I'm going to say image now you may wondering now how the heck is like are we able to Target all these CSS like this well that's the power of style components what we can do is we can we can Target it basically our elements like a tree for example here we're targeting the attack within the nav menu div here we're targeting the image tag within the a tag you see so we can do that in style components right for images let's make the image here height of 20 pixels and whenever we give a height the the width changes automatically beautiful oh so much better so much better so much better all right so much better I like it so much more beautiful we got that portion let's now go to the uh the span tag okay so span okay and then here uh pretty much again nothing much let's change the font size here so we'll say font size not don't size font size font size okay font size 13 pixels you guys all good still on on Zoom yes you guys are still great yes yes yes yes beautiful yes give me the hands up hands up hey let's go beautiful that's what I'm talking about font size 13 pixels let's give it some ladder spacing letter spacing and the mom for David if you have any issues just speak out loud and I'll be able to resolve anything okay 1.42 pixels all right and so forth let me see so now you see it changes a little bit there's a little bit of a difference now in terms of how it looks like which is pretty great all right now let's go ahead all we need to do now at this point is very simple is well I pretty much just need to copy this stuff so let's go to here let's remove this let's put this all at the bottom don't need this at all actually we don't even need this portion too either honestly so a tag command C I'm going to duplicate this command V right and instead of down those this for example this will be search right and this will be instead of Hallmark it will be search icon search icon all right save that next up look at that you see how to create a search like on the right hand side just as we speak right here look at that done beautiful all right next one all right I'll just duplicate it here boom next one is going to be not the home icon but it's gonna be the watch list icon watch list dunzel alright so we'll say watch list icon in here watch list icon all right same thing going before this the third one or the fourth one my bad there we go oh another one look at that look at that Mighty look at that crikey oh no that's that's from a movie all right it's gonna be the original one this time original icon we're going to use and we're going to say Originals here foreign nose all right okay okay same thing again instead of doing this I want to do movies here movies let me go to movie icons icon beautiful all right same thing you see now we have movie on the right hand side if I scroll down to the right hand side yeah it's okay don't worry about that just yet you see beautiful look at that oh so good so good all right and then the last one is going to be which one is going to be series last One's Gonna Be Series right here so we'll say here we'll say series and then we'll say series Dash icon series Dash icon let's go ahead and save that oh beautiful look at that oh oh that's so good oh let's go that's amazing guys that's amazing that's so good there we go look at that so that's our going to be our navigation menu now at this point now we're not done yet I gotta have some fun sometimes okay all right next up is going to be the user image profile all right so let me go ahead all right uh the next one is going to be this one right here which is this little literally this little small icon right here that's all we are going to do uh let me do this here and this this is going to be called the user image so here we'll say user user Imager right and so forth now with this image let's go ahead and go down here and we'll say const user image is equal to styled dot div oh no not that they're actually that image it's going to be an image type component you see so with style components you can have different type components images you can have spans we can have divs right now but basically any HTML component you can have you can have that with a style component all right now on the user image the image we're going to use for the time being is going to be just this one right here it's going to be you can use any image you want technically but I have this one right here and hopefully we can have a monitor David put in the chat there we go and that's going to be pretty that's actually my image it's actually me that's not all right let's see let's see how does it look like oh let's go let's me if you have your own picture use your own picture I highly recommend that you use a square picture that's gonna be very helpful very helpful to you okay all right so that's gonna be sick okay so do that now of course we're not done yet uh we need to do is let's go ahead and make this a little bit better well let's go ahead and set the way so check this out guys if I want to edit the style for this I hit command and click on this you see anomalous Styles check this out how cool is that out command click on the actual user image I think in Windows is control click I think so or Windows click I'm not sure try one of those so inside the user image I'm going to say width with 48 pixels okay height height also 48 pixels done save it all right now it's a bit smaller which is great and then I'm going to get a border radius borders radius of 50 now what that does is that gives it basically a circle that makes it into a circle because the Border radius basically as the Cur the beautiful most beautiful curvature on there on all the corners right you see right here fifty percent of the full image is going to be basically curved up that's what I mean next thing I'm going to make it to cursor pointer the reason why we do that is because it looks like or it feels like a you know a button the youth all right oh let's go all right last thing look at this you see how this icon is all at all with the left hand side well what I can do is I can actually expand the nav menu the nav menu right here to push this icon all the way to the right hand side by using what what do you guys think we can do here let me know what do you guys think put in the chat what do you guys think we can do to push this now menu right here all the way to the right hand side well that's very simple actually I can go to the nav menu and I can say the nav menu hey you know what let's give the flex of a one look at this nav menu I'm gonna say Flex one and what that does that's biscuit says look at this that says hey this name menu is the most important thing right and you want to explain to as much as possible and so that's what that what that does okay I'm going to give it a small margin left 20 pixels margin left modular 20 pixels is tomorrow ah margin Dash left I'm gonna give it 20 pixels 20 pixels right here uh 25 actually give some spacing and they'll add inside there you go just to give spacing and then the last I want to do is for each a tag I'm gonna give it a cursor pointer all right cursor pointer and what that does is going to make you like a hand there we go now it's a hand you see that right there now it's a hand okay but okay we're not done yet I also want to make this into a line item Center so this basically will here will Center it vertically so I'll line items might not change might not change a little bit just see that does not change much honestly right here it's beautiful right there all right so align them Center and that's looking pretty good wouldn't you say so what do you guys think let me know let me know in the comments below let me know in the chat what are you guys think so far that's looking really really good so far all right I like it next up all right next one let's go ahead and make that a beautiful animation that we have just this one so this is going to be really really cool the way we make this happen is really cool really cool all right Monique says beautiful I like it thank you money all right let's go and check up on YouTube here for a second here all right that's what I'm talking Nicholas says awesome sweet Flex ah you guys are amazing I like it nice bro Javier says nice bro all right all right now a few things that we need to make to make it kind of like uh you know to make that portion happen so um check this one out this is going to be like a really cool trick that maybe you have not learned before but inside the um here inside this span this pan here's what we can do we can use something called um after so what does it do right here I'm gonna say here I'm gonna say this this after now what this adds is this adds almost like a div this adds a div right here so I'm gonna say after I'm gonna give a content and I'll explain what again what it does in a second here content of empty string okay and I'm going to give it a height so imagine it like a normal div height of two pixels I have two pixels and I'm going to say background is white background is white okay and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to position okay well for now it's going to see what does that do and let's see refresh uh nothing so much because we need to give the width so let's give the actually give the Contour like hello jello see there you go there it is right here it's called Jello see and it's back on color white if I remove this black and color white Jello now what it does if I when it's back download on this one here's what it does is it adds a div after the ending of everything so check this out if I go to span you see there's home and then there's a after imagine this after almost like a div like a div you see and it has the content Jello and a height of two pixels and with that we can actually be very very very useful we can actually be very smart with that let's go and save this beautiful all right let's go and do that save that all right and of course we don't need Jello at this point right no I mean unless you guys like jello who like jello here anybody likes Jello here I like jello I'm a big fan of jello I love Jello it's my favorite favorite type of food okay love jello all right beautiful there we go that's what I'm talking about so let's go ahead and do the following now so how am I going to position this you see how this position inside here especially at the bottom how do we make that work well let's think about it I'm going to use something called position absolute so here's what I'll do I'll do position absolute absolute absolute right here and I'll give a top of zero of zero and I was playing well how that works out a little bit top left of zero right of zero and then bottom is actually going to be minus six pixels so why mine is not you might be asking well a few reasons why save this as you can see right there it's still not show now because why we need to give it if you're going to position absolute something it needs to be positioned to what to a relative object well let's make the same the the span position relative and so you have to give it a parent to cling on to right so let's go ahead and save that position relative content High 20 pixels okay okay okay opacity of one background color white all right let's go and refresh this still not there let me see make sure it's all out it's all good let me see inspect that one and this one home oh because I did not put this correctly there you go boom right there you see now it's at the top okay it's at the top or why because I do I though this top zero don't need this remove this one type zero boo now to the bottom you see that right there look now it's at the bottom so we have this line here that was created how well we said that okay you have this div right here it's called a span okay we have this div and we said hey you know what let's all let's go ahead and create another div we're using after but let's make that div which is this one right here let's make the small div let's give it a height of two pixels a backup color of white unless absolute position it to the left where there's no space to left there's no space to the right and from the bottom it's like for example wait from the left create no spacing from the right there's no spacing and then from the bottom there's only negative six pixels meaning it will push it down it will actually push down the div below this band component that's really cool part you need to understand right it will push down below this Bank opponent okay let's go ahead and continue on all right awesome sweet sweet sweet you guys still good yes yes yes yes yes beautiful beautiful all right all right Derek I think you're still good Alex you're still a little good Jared I think look you're still good as well beautiful Leonard as well and same as Christian all right sweet sweet all right all right now the way we need to start out now of course when we go ahead and build stuff like this of course you see how that does not show up until until we actually do something about it right until we hover over it so how do we make that happen well um very simple very simple let's do initially we're going to give the passive zero passive zero opacity of zero and then we'll do transform skill X zero so what does this do scale x0 basically is going to scale the I'm going to go ahead and comments will pass it here for a second so it's going to scale the div to zero if I do 0.5 it's going to make it 0.5 you see that right there 0.5 the simple as that right all right if I make it for example 1 dance can be the full thing right there see but if I do zero it's going to make it zero okay now in our case I'm going to make a zero and also passes zero and then well here's what we'll do on the hover of span on the hover actually of the whole a tag which is inside here look at this I'll do the following this this this will say hover boom voila I will do spin after right right and the hover of this of this spent after was a transform transform scale X into one so we go from zero to one scale basically from zero width to the full 100 width that's what that means and then I'm going to give opacity of one for that all right let's try it let's try it oh oh does not work that's okay that's okay because we need to give it a transform from what to what so check this out I need to give this transform origin from left to the center let's try refresh again oh two two two that's not really happening here let's go ahead and see what's going on here so we have a tag that's on here on the hover of that ban we're calling the span which is that one right after transform transform scale X one oh right here right there that's the one boom boom boom boom look at that see boom boom boom so it shows up on the hover you see opacity wanna transfer scale works one but let's make it even beautiful beautiful look at this all right I'm going to add a transition and hear the transition this is a special transition and this says transition everything all all attributes at 250 milliseconds and this is a special type of tradition right this right here basically says what type of a transition there's like a linear transition this is this right here number has a special temperature it may be for example a month then maybe you can put it down the chat in the zoom in this specific text right here right cubic bizire cubic bizarre right here all right so it's a really cool transition that if I now apply this oh oh oh let's go let's go boom boom boom boom boom boom look at that guys how cool is that look at that how cool is that what do you guys think huh that's pretty awesome what you think so that's pretty awesome you can actually have this like I said it's this one right here pubic desire right a little bit desire use that one you can do linear as well but ah you can do linear but we don't want that that's not not not too much fun all right so save that and that's it our header now at this point is officially done that's it it's done done so that's it comprende all right all right so that's all good Hatter is finished okay header is finished and let's go ahead and go to here a git and I'm going to actually save it so I'm going to say add header so I'm going to save this inside the git and I want you guys to get used to doing stuff with this as well so add header that's going to save it into our get all right and that's it we don't have to worry about anything else at this point besides that that looks so good by the way that looks so great that looks so good well don't you guys think it looks awesome raise your hand I think this looks amazing yeah and it's the way it's done is very intricate too it's all using CSS you see right this transform origin is saying hey go from the left corner to the center right here you see kind of uh from left corner to the center that's the same the transition say transition all of this and the transform says scale it from zero to one that's it that's all I'm saying that's as simple as that all right let me see now disappointing YouTube we have 356 people on YouTube let's go 423 people on YouTube that is beautiful amazing amazing excited to see all of you wow wow that's actually pretty great all right so that's what we have this at this point okay I know everybody looks yeah it's amazing that's cool that's cool it's cool I like it okay so that's part one let's now look at the home page okay the home page now let me go ahead and focus put this on the right hand side and put it more on the right hand side all right home page is done check mark all right next up let oh header is done check mark next up is home page homepage is going to be a little bit more difficult but that's completely okay let's go to the home page all right um so the homepage will have a few things all right of course uh let's start out with a container here like we always like to do so let's go and import style components here import styled from from what style components Dash components all right sweet aimport stuff to the style components let's do the following so const container equal styled the what start that there for now oh actually no style domain so mean is actually a great it's a very HTML5 friendly basically it tells Google or any other browser that this is the main content right so it's the same thing as saying div except that uh you know underneath the hood Google likes to read that so that's why we say Main all right now for this one let's do the following for this one okay um a few things few things all right a few things we need to think about here uh first things first let's do a main height so we're going to do Min height main height here so what is the main height uh really is the following um remember how this height is 70 pixels so this right here is 70 pixels okay that's 70 pixels all right then that's mean that this will be what the rest correct so that this right here it means will be those will be the rest of the the height right so that's what that's what that means well to make that happen here's what we can do I can say calc so CSS can actually calculate stuff for you I can say a hundred VH that means a hundred vertical height 100 ago that's the full width from top to bottom of the view view height viewport that's the browser height minus 70 pixels right so that's the height main height is this full height beautiful we got that all right all right so we have that and then another padding to it padding padding and I'm gonna go to zero calc here and all this is saying is this is 3.5 view uh vertical uh kind of view width 2.4 or 3.5 actually 3.5 view width plus five pixels that's just pretty much it's nothing too crazy just a very soft calculation so this means top bottom zero pixels left and right is this one right here sorry all right now how do we actually see this well it's very simple let's go ahead and actually add a background color here back on blue let's see our let's see background blue okay does not show up on there background color blue blue is that there or no let me see inspect element in this one um let's see inspect Alma here uh body root app Dave home oh here's why the reason why it's not working is because remember what we did here is we forgot to put the container so container is actually being used here instead of div container boom container nice I like oh that's cool let's remove this hideous color please I don't like that okay so so that's all good now with the color that we do want to use however is going to be like a home color a background color it's gonna be actually this color right here so what I want you guys to do to add a nice background color is that CSS here in the index.css here and let's go to body and do here background color right here hashtag zero four zero seven one four it's a nice color that we're going to use for the Disney plus clone okay that's that's ever see nothing too crazy just just a very simple one okay just about that all right beautiful all right next up so that's all good let's go ahead and go to home.gus all right I like it I like it like that I like it like taking it anyways guys all right let me see so that's all good next up is gonna be watch next up is going to be we need to now add the background image now if you look at our Disney plus clone make it a little bit bigger you see we have this background image that looks that's in here see this as I scroll you see it's there you see that as I scroll there's a background image in there you can have to look very close in here you see it's a background image so how do we make that work well um let's take a look at it what we're going to do is we're going to use this after before stuff that we talked about before okay before that's that's a fun that's a funny pun funny punners before all right done before and it basically will add a div before the container check this out I'm gonna say background background here now it's a URL boom done okay I'm gonna give it Dash images Dash images a dash home Dash background that what that PNG done okay now so that's the URL I'm gonna say Center that's the vertically Center horizontally centered right and then I'm going to say what um center dash where am I where am I right okay sender then I'm going to cover and then I'm going to say no repeat and fixed so no repeat means do not repeat this no repeat do not repeat repeat uh this image right and it can be a fixed image now how fixed we'll talk about that in a second here all right now it's still not there of course it's not here right you don't see you don't you only see oh that's not good right you still see only this no problem whatsoever right so let's do this right so again it's URL images whole background PNG Center Center cover no repeat fix no changes so far don't worry I'm gonna do content here check this out now content nothing just how I usually like to do it okay now again if I add content for example like y'all save that yo see it adds a before right there see let's go ahead and do it like this right there I think I'm going to position absolute that's the cool part position absolute right all right right and I'm going to say now the following top zero left zero zero then I'm going to say write zero right and then bottom uh bottom zero right save that now still nothing happens why because the following because we need to make it absolute to what I need to make this position relative save that all right save it let's see let's see position relative background is this content is this and fixed the Mississippi absolute refresh this um I don't really see the background image yeah there's no bueno let me see your L am I doing this right bottom zero I'm gonna say Z index minus one all right I don't see the background image just yet don't worry about that we'll make that happen a little bit here let's see I think it has to put this back on let me let me try this just for a second here boom boom boom boom boom boom okay so there was a little bit of mix up here so I guess I did it wrong in terms of how we set the background so here's what we'll do background URL right there images home background.png Center this horizontal vertical Center this is basically the type of positioning here right this is background position cover right I'm going to add a dash here so Dash cover and after that we say no repeat and then we say fixed okay so fix means basically fixed on the page so if I scroll if I scroll it will always be fixed on there okay that's what that means guys if I scroll it will always be fixed on there that's what that means look how good this looks already so good so good I like it that looks beautiful and again how does it work again right because if you think about this let's look at our rectangle here boom there's a rectangle right that's our home let me go ahead and forces here this right here is our home component you can see right then what we did is when we did before we added another div right there's no name for it right and we give it a content of nothing and we need position absolute top zero left zero right zero bottom zero meaning here's what that means that it's going to be 0 pixels from the left zero pixel from the top zero pixels from the bottom of this from the bottom right the zip is from the right so when you do that you stretch the whole div to the end of this dip like so oops to this right here that's what you do and so now we have this extra div that blue chip salute it will not move anywhere and it will be behind all content all the time because we give it a z index of minus one that's why okay so I want you guys to really think about that Z is a big deal this is 0 minus one you will later on if you will see when I add content to it like if I do for example if I forget this music let's remove this for a second here see the home was gone right if I do see them as one home is out there you see that's why that's what that's so important okay and honestly that's it you're done on this container home now of course no you're not pretty much done but this is looking now very good raise your hand if you're still with it are you still with me raise your hand yeah you guys still with me how beautiful is this turnout to be just within about what one hour at this point within one hour we've gone so far now exactly it's beautiful all right and on YouTube guys I know you guys are killing it as well it's a lot of fun all right so we got that portion we got this I like it I like it like that okay anyways all right um so now next portion is going to be the image slider which is gonna be oh this is gonna be so much fun you guys are you ready for the image slider oh that sucks it's gonna be a fun one it's gonna be a fun one because I know you guys will be confused that's why that's why exactly why so but it's okay we'll we'll do this together don't worry about that so image slider so what are we going to use for this image lab well the first thing to do is we need to create the actual component so let's go ahead and do inside the components folder right click new file and we'll say what we'll say image image slider dot JS done all right let's do rfce to create our component all right and we'll say image slider here all right save that beautiful image slider and of course it's not here because we need to import it so let's go back to our home.js which is right here and let's import that right just how we always import we like to import so import what image image slider from what from from going to be from what is it guys what is it component what what is it well directly from here because our image slider is inside this folder components folder and our home page inside this folder so we'll say dot dash image slider save that let's go and create the component side here now so say image slider done all right boom image slide is right here all right so that's pretty good I'm pretty happy about that how that's turning out all right it's really really good actually I like that a lot all right so that's really cool so and now let's actually work inside the image slider let's go into here boom now we're inside here okay all right inside here a few things we need to do what we're going to use to do to do image slider is something called react slick check this out sorry let me get some water I'm dying out here oh yeah you know you guys don't want me to die right I hope so I hope not all right so there we go so it's called the react slick and it will give you some examples here but basically it's a react module that's been built for us to make beautiful sliders so right here reacts the documentation right there boom see you right there and this looks pretty much exactly the same as what we're trying to build and actually tells us how we need to build this there's a settings there's a component right here there's settings we need to give it and then we just return the div you can see we will use the slider component that's this one right that's like opponent and then we'll use it where we'll use it inside here right there right so that's how we need to do so the first thing for you to do is we need to install image slider and well to make that happens go back to here react slick all right all right so okay so npm install reacts like dash dash say let's go and copy that all right let's open up our terminal which we like to do by right clicking and then open an integrate terminal no problem right click on package.json or whatever you have to click right click on let's open up this okay so do npm install react slick dash dash save done hit enter okay that will install the react select module for you okay done that's all good we're not done yet though but now we need to do npm install slick Carousel this will install us the CSS we need to use so next one is going to be npm install slick here so that's next one and enter and look at this guys it literally has 746 000 weekly downloads this tells me that this is a good module to download no good no mods not good module to download basically it's very well supported that's what that tells me okay okay now what we do is we need to now import these CSS files here okay and need to import of course import the actual uh the actual as well slider so let's do that so here we'll say import import slider from react Dash slick fast slick all right save that right and then we'll do the following we'll save here or say lat settings ah don't let's not do that just yet actually I'll do that just yet get that for a second here and then we need to import the CSS files right here Imports like carousel right here so these ones are really really important so import and hopefully a monthly where you guys can take care of it maybe you guys can put in the chat something keep putting a chat hopefully uh Imports like carousels looks like that CSS right there that's the one that we need to use okay all right save that beautiful and we're not done yet so now at this point let's go ahead and use style components as well so let's go ahead and import style components of course we're we're currently here okay there so let's go ahead and do import style components import styled import styled styled from from what styled Dash components done stylish components all right so that's that's good and instead of doing uh div we're going to say carousel so command D just like both carousel done and let's create that stock component we'll say const carousel is equal to what not style that they have actually but check this out remember how we had to use slider remember how inside here we had to use slider component you see which came directly from here remember that well watch this I'm going to say styled slider basically instead of doing slider inside directly inside here I'm giving it a style component because then I can actually style it myself right that's the whole reason why that's the cool part about this so slider okay so that's there uh everything's gone everything's deleted that's okay don't worry there's a reason for it probably I know 100 hopefully I think it's because the fact that we import a slider and we have not given it any uh settings yet so don't worry about that so let's go ahead and quit some settings and we'll do let settings equals the following and there's a few times we can set there's like dots you know infinite true speed and so forth and first dots so that's the dots that will show up at the bottom so we'll say dots that's going to be true comma they will say infinite that's true basically you will infinitely should be able to infinite infinite that's going to be true as well all right then speed is going to be 500 that's 500 milliseconds that's basically half a second okay slides to show one to show ah my bad it's gonna be one comma and then we're going to do uh uh slice to scroll how many slices go for scroll biscuit slides to scroll is going to be one as well okay an auto uh Auto play is going to be true boom so this is our settings okay I'll place it with the true let's get the things now to here now the way we do that is using something this is called destructuring you see how they do it here it's called destructuring that's what that that's what that does so say dot dot dot dot settings basically it's put it puts in basically all of these all of these settings directly into the carousel div as a as a basically as a what's it called a so save that why is my thing not working that's interesting right click it inspect almond where's my header where's everything it's not it's not there at all the help Carousel they're just going nuts on me let's go and Spike down below here body the root oh there's something happening here it's very interesting some they fail which are like oh slider but we are recording the div component type is invalid expect the string for builtin components of a class function react Dom defined but you likely forget to export your component from the file it's defined in or you might have mixed up a default or name view okay Imports interesting style import slider die right through rightly let me see slider import slider from Carousel slick see import slider make sure it's all good guys and on YouTube you guys have the same and you guys have the same issue is it just me maybe it's just me it's okay we'll be able to solve anything we put on mine too correct cons Carousel that's fine that's all good we imported it correctly which is correct right maybe it's because we need to have an actual div inside here let's try let's see this let me let me try this let me try this for a second okay boom let me try this for a second here one second I'm gonna do the rap as a style that div don't worry about it don't worry don't worry I got you guys so const wrap is equal to style dot div okay let's see okay so all right so the reason why it wasn't working looks like is all right so oh I know I know it's fine don't worry about it it's gonna fit your fix okay so the reason why it's working because when we put it into the slider right there's literally nothing here right there was nothing to slide and so it gives us errors right because it probably expects us to have some kind of a slider right it's some kind of uh the actual image inside here because if you look at here right we need to give it a div right a div to slide through so day of H1 or H3 whatever might be right and so we're doing here is we're kind of did well to create a div what we're going to do is the following so let's go back to here right again it's going to be not going to work but we're going to create a wrap here a raptive so that's going to be it's just a normal div going to be a style component what should we create inside here constrap style.div okay then inside here we're going to create an image that's the images we were going to uh now that's going to show up basically so do the following so we'll say image here say image and we'll say source is equal to the following okay there's going to be Dash images Dash slider slider Dash badging that jpeg there you go and close it out all right so good that's image one and now I'm going to get another image let's go ahead and do another image there we go now we have ourselves a slider right I know it looks horrible I know it's like bad boom very bad right now would you think that's bad right right raise your hand that's that's bad right that's pretty bad yeah I'll agree with that yeah you guys want to make it better shall we make it better yeah she'll make it better I think so I think so all right uh this pretty much just requires a a little bit of CSS that's that's pretty much all it does it all requires okay um so let's go ahead and actually look at our CSS here I'm gonna put this here uh boom right here wrote that here all right so we're gonna focus on the curious so here let's do a margin top here for a second so margin top so margin Dash top is going to be 20 pixels boom all right that's gonna basically push a little bit oh they'll just go away the hell oh no this happened so save that so it pushes the slider over to the bottom which that's what I like to do that's what I kind of like right so I kind of wanted to put a little bit more to the towards the bottom okay all right okay all right awesome sweet so that's that all right and then what I want to do is well a few things um let's focus on the wrap here for a second here okay this wrap let's look at this image okay image let's focus on this image and with this image let's give the width width of a hundred percent and a height of a hundred percent okay boom right there see done so 100 and now it's a lot lot better would you give me that one I would say so um next up for this one let's change this one to not be slider badging let's change it to be slider b b a badag but that that's actually inside the images folder but dag the jpeg all right establish we have now two different images you see right there but dag but that's funny but Doug that's funny all right on the image side um a few things I want to give it a little bit of a curvature here so let's do the following so a little bit of a curvature uh we're gonna do the following so I'm gonna say image and I'm gonna say border radius okay border radius board Dash radius radius of 4 pixels it's going to curve a little bit of that of that kind of like this image a little bit maybe you see it you see right there maybe you see that right there see that you see how it curve is it a little bit I see that curls are just a little bit right there just right there okay okay then I'm going to give it a box Shadow now I want you guys to copy this one okay this box shadow check this out okay right there so RGB biscuit that's basically where the color it's coming from to the character where it's going so it's very simple right RGB right here maybe uh David Romano maybe you guys can put in this box Shadow for everybody in the comments below is 0.6 pixel 30 30 pixels minus 10 pixels maybe you guys you can put it it's basically just a box Shadow style that's all it is now I know it looks horrible right now it looks horrible now don't worry don't you worry at all okay so back shadow look at that oh that looks so good it looks so good all right I mean actually does not look good I'm sorry um does not look good at all actually so the reason why it does not look good at all because inside this right here this slick component it's called slick component we call it um we don't you see how in reality we're supposed to see all these other images you see all these other images on the right hand side and the left hand side you see that but we don't see that the reason being is because there's no overflow hidden on this dip overflow and biscuit on any overflow it hides the rest so to prevent that what we're going to do is the following so I'm going to say inside the carousel I'm going to Target the Slick list select Dash list and here I'm going to say overflow visible boom holy that made a big difference you see just like that look see overflow visible to overflow hidden right so before initially it was hidden by default that was inside their CSS that would they that they gave you see now it's visible visible visible done now it's visible okay right there so that's gonna be that but they're awesome sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet oh that looks so good okay it looks so good look at that oh that's so guys how cool is that raise your hand with me if you're still with me yes yes yes everybody everybody beautiful I like it it's looking so good we're making such good progress I love it all right so that's overflow visible and then what we're going to do is a few things I'm I need to change up to make it even better okay let's give a small border uh so get a border I'm gonna say border four pixels here on this image I'm gonna say border 4 pixels solid right transparent now what does that mean transparent is the color you see it adds a small like just transparent color now again right here it's kind of like right here and don't worry we'll fix it kind of how it looks like again it looks a little bit odd right here I know don't worry about it we'll fix that in a second here I'll fix that a second here so it's gonna be a transparent border right um next thing let's do the following here um on the Carousel and the carousel so we have slick list and then we're going to add a color white on all these active buttons right so let's do the following to do that I'm going to say Li dot slick active so when there's an active button active button before right now how does this work out I will show you in a little bit here for a second here and I'm going to say color white white okay Ally it's like that's actually inside let me see the carousel okay I'm also going to do the following so I'm gonna say on every single button right here I'm gonna say UL Li button these are the basically the the next button right here and I'm gonna say like this before I'm gonna say here font size let's say font size I'm gonna increase the fonts decrease fans are just a little bit so font size 10 pixels right there okay I'm gonna say give it a color I mean you can be cool it can be just a white color right there so these buttons are here see see boom all right so but I'm gonna give this a more gentle color I don't like that actually too much I like this color right here this guy's a little more gentler I kind of like that a little a little better a little better okay so that's kind of that color white uh same thing with right there oh you see how it has like this white more of a more of a white look when on the active on the active button you see that right there see right there beautiful all right now you see how we have the next button but we don't have the previous button the reason why why is because of the Z index so if I do button here and I give it a z index of one a one check this out oh let's go you see right there that my friends is basically what we need right so that's that's pretty much that I'm going to zoom in on this let me see how does this look like what are you guys think so far it's working pretty good I think so too I think so too I like it I like it I like it I like it I like it like that all right that's looking pretty good I like the way it's going oh my God not save this I don't want that that's pretty pretty good and then the next thing we need to do is to make it work a little bit better is is the following so so check this out you see how here you see how that's like this border is within this image you see it's like a little bit better right that's kind of how I like it a lot better so what we'll do is this is called because of box sizing it's it's a bit a little weird but I want you guys to understand this a little bit here um it's all because of box signing border box so you see how these borders are on the outside here on the outside well to make them on the inside to make the biscuit included part of the whole image I'm going to go to app.css and I'm going to say everything that you have oops oops oops oops they have box size and board box save that boom see big difference look at that you see now what happens with this is basically it's telling for example uh border box when I say border box is 10 hit the content should contain the Border itself basically the width contains the Border that's what that means right and so that's way when I say with 100 right the width actually is contained within the Border that's what that means right that's what we can see the border which is much much better now and I like that a lot better honestly yeah oh let's go look at how good that looks guys that looks so so good oh my God it makes me happy all right let's go back to home.js let's go to image slider back to here we're not done yet we're almost done but not done yet almost there but we're not there we're so close but we're not there yet let's go uh the next thing um I want to give it a small hover effect so what do I mean by that on the hover of the image fully I want to change the small a few small things I'm going to be in here okay so I'm going to say hover I want to say hover hover and I'm gonna change the color the color of the board to be white so I'm gonna say border is going to be 4 pixels solid solid but this time the Border color is going to be this one right here oh we see this rgba 249 so it's almost like a white color with a little bit of transparency and then save that let's see oh let's go look at that right there see okay next thing let's give it a cursor point to the wrap cursor cursor pointer the wrap okay so when I hover it's like actually like a it's actually like a cursor right here you see it's good beautiful and then the last is give it a transition so the transition rate should be transition let's give it extra transition so we'll say transition duration oh look at that so much better you guys so so so much better that's so much better what do you guys think huh what do you guys think Hmm I like that so much better uh I need to fix this brush over here see this before I should be before in here okay there's the color white I'll refresh this oh let's go whoo beautiful beautiful and guys we have made ourselves a a carousel that's it the carousel is right there now you'll be wondering I want to ask you questions I may have a question do you raise your hand if you think you wanna you're wondering like how the heck does this work like imagine if you wonder how the hell does this work okay good so look so because this is actually part of this is within the actual what's it called This is within um um what am I say oh yeah we also need to fix this portion I need to fix this don't worry we'll fix this I got it we'll play this in a second okay here so if I right click on this inspect element let me put this here a little bit to the bottom here okay I'm gonna put it here uh this is the button here you see button see this button so what's gonna happen we have this you see here look align slick active so automatically basically JavaScript underneath the hood is adding a slick active class you see this to this Li bone forces here then it goes to here and so we're doing here we're targeting a CSS class called called Li slick active right there and then we're targeting the button now look at this see there's buttons you see this so button okay let me let me let me do auto play false for now so this stops here okay so it stops moving around right so you see here right there so button here so now this is a select active here I'm gonna say button and look before you see so a line slick active a button before and we've done this actually is done through the slit Carousel module right they do this themselves and look at that this before button has a color black what we did we said no make it color white that's what we did we overwrote overwrote the natural natural CSS that comes with react slick do you understand that raise your hand if you understand it with me yes do you see what I'm talking about do you see what I'm talking about yes we overwrote it but because by default by default the Slick active if you go to Slick active you go to that button they go to before so you select active button before by default it's just color black see here that's the default CSS that comes with the slick theme which is this one right here you see with this like theme CSS but we said no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no we're gonna change ourselves that's what happened here so that's what we did here color white that's it all right and that's what happened now funny enough let's go ahead and fix this portion because that's pretty bad uh you guys want to fix that yeah originally if you guys don't fix that yeah I think so too all right well that's honestly that's not that bad to fix so what we do is we need to go to actually index.css Js let's go home.js and all you need to do on the home.js is just say overflow hidden that's it so overflow here overflow inside the hollow.js Overflow Dash X is going to be hidden save it and so save that refresh is it still there Ah that's it and then also do the same thing on the header actually let's go to header actually so header.js same thing on the nav let's do overflow exiting overflow and what really this does is very simple guys overflow based basically means when some content overflows what your view your view with like if a Content overflows your view with we simply just hide it and you see right there we don't have that weird camaraderie going on anymore it's that's it it's done that's it awesome let's go back to image slider and let's go back to autoplay and we'll say the true now save it there we go awesome sweet all right we got that that's all good all right so raise your hand is still with me everybody's still with me all right next up look guys we have made our own image curiosa and it looks sick it looks so good it looks so good it looks so good boom boom boom boom boom boom boom wait was it false or true like this awesome it looks so good all right the next thing we need to work on is going to be uh these posts right here so this portion so this portion is gonna be really fun to make actually so we're gonna call them called they're go They're gonna be called viewers is what they're going to be called so let's go to here let's call them viewers so let's create a new component here and so new component new file it's called this viewers V e v i e where's that dot Js right there you're the Js all right so that's going to be viewers.js and what we need to do with this one is very simple is let's go and do rfce and viewers right there so save that awesome sweet save that and the following needs to happen now at this point is okay and we need to of course now input this I'm gonna say viewers here viewers let's go to import it inside where import inside the home.js so important Helm let's do import viewers viewers from from where from dot slash viewers ah this one yours right there okay let's also go ahead and say this let's go ahead and do add image slider slider let's go and save that all right that looks so good it looks so good all right sweet so that's amazing I like that import viewers and let's go ahead and actually use this one so we'll say viewers let's use this component let's use a component I like it not drivers buyers viewers all right that looks sick okay boom all right so that's that one and of course now if we go ahead to our racked app boom we have viewers right here you see of course that's not what we want to do but that's what we got so far understand comprende all good good all right let's now work inside the viewers.js file which is going to be pretty pretty simple it's not gonna be it's not gonna be anything too crazy or anything in terms of CSS uh you just learn some stuff so let's go ahead and do import style you know the drill guys import styled styled from what from stock components styled Dash components components save that awesome okay and let's go ahead and create the container oh oh container and let's go and create the the container component so I'll say container here so const const container is equal to styled dot div the div Denzel done Zone okay simple so all right now let's go ahead and do the following uh let's do at this point let's give us a padding for us so the container let's do padding padding let's do some stuff let's do container padding zero zero 26 pixels and what is this actually on about what is this 26 pixels well if I go ahead and take a look at this here let's go and say this right click viewers come on good okay so this one here right there so 26 pixels means literally petting bottom 26 pixels that's the shortcut for this one right pending bottom 26 pixels that's what that means okay all right now okay so that's all good that's so good now let's go ahead and take a look at what we're going to put in here well this one is going to have a few things inside inside here actually no I need to be inside here container no actually it's not depending but my bad hold on that's not right hold on so this is right here actually let's do margin top my bad margin Dash top margin top and we'll say 30 pixels here okay that makes more sense right 30 pixels that pushup pushes and more to the bottom um let's do the following now let's do um display grid so this would be really interesting now we're gonna go into grid now now what is this grid raise your hand if you know what grid is anybody know what grid is what is Grid or just yeah so what is grid so grid is basically it's kind of like Flex but it allows us to be very discreet it's like a it's it's a it's basically like a uh you know Flex on steroids that's what I'll call it you know that's what I'll call it and we'll give it a grid and we'll say here we'll say grid template columns so we'll have three so we have Falcon with template template columns columns and with query template columns well actually hey there before we do that let me go ahead and come with this portion out just so I can show it to you inside the container of course we do we need to have all these images right so we need to create the web so I'm going to say create wrap wrap for this one rap right so every single thing is going to be a wrap so this is gonna be your wrap that's gonna be a wrap it's gonna be individual dips right here that's what these are okay understand comprending good right wrap and every single rapper will have an image so it's an image image and we'll say source is equal to and it's going to be this one this is the image right here so hopefully maybe you guys see you guys know where to get it or maybe a month they can help you guys out and actually give you guys the image okay so images viewers Disney rap is undefined and we're able to find it right now so it's a const const wrap is equal to styled dot div that's what it's equal to okay Okay so style.div boom right there that's amazing okay and oh my God it looks so bad don't worry about it so let's go ahead and create a few of them okay so let's go ahead and do actually create five of them oh my God it looks so bad but two three four five okay all righty let's go look at this it looks horrible I know it's okay don't worry about it so now to fix that that's where Grizz gonna come in so let's go try this out so with grid and I'm gonna give it columns now so look at this great typical columns I'm going to say repeat so what this says create five columns so five comma min max and what this does is basically gives it a whip basically what is it what we should use well a minimum is zero basically about the 1fr simply means stretch it out as much as possible basically that's what one of our stands for okay boom all right okay now it's kind of like in line but it still looks horrible uh and so that's already to actually go to the wrap and actually fix that right because technically we have five grids if you look at it right look see one see five grits one two three four five you see it's there it's just a Disney the images are actually overflowing that's what's got going on right here so to fix that if we go to wrap and we'll say here image right I'm going to say a width of 100 so basically the image should take up 100 100 percent done okay oh boom right there awesome sweet right so I'm then going to say I'm going to say height of those 100 simply height 100 percent boom right then I'm gonna say object fit so rjfit means hey fit up the object as much as possible so object fit cover so fitted the image as much as possible inside this div awesome and that's honestly pretty much it now for this wrap let's give it some stuff let's give this this so we'll say here uh border let's give it a border and the Border will be look like a little bit like this kind of it's a very light border look three pixel solid rgba that's the RGB I want you guys to use right 249 249 and 0.1 so guys it's a very light border let's go save that Okay order is it not showing up let's see not sure not but just completely okay border oh that didn't real right we have border let's see border zero pixels oh solid solid right there awesome so that looks great so we have one two three four five things that we have okay now of course let's add some border radius to this one I'm gonna say border radius border Dash radius radius and let's give it a 10 pixel radius nice oh looks so much better now now it still looks pretty bad I don't like it did you guys agree with me this would you guys agree that it needs some spacing in between like in between every single column would you guys agree with me in that one should we add some spacing yeah beautiful all right beautiful so to do that we're gonna use a gap we're going to use something called Gap so check this out okay let's use grid Gap grid Dash Gap and I will say 25 pixels boom oh look at that so grid Gap is a very useful tool okay it's a very useful way to add a gap between every single grid item oh boom see so simple so simple right and now let's go ahead maybe add some uh let's get add some padding inside this container so we'll say padding let's say 30 pixels zero then we'll say 26 pixels boom so push it over the bottom so basically if you inspect down but on this one if I go ahead and go look at this specific padding you see this literally just means it's very simple padding top is 30 pixels petting your right is zero putting left to zero and then painting bottom is 26 but this is means Top This is bottom this right here stands for left and right that's what that means okay all right beautiful all right so that's that now let's go ahead and give it a box shadow okay I'm gonna get a box shot it looks a little bit kind of like this right there so again you can copy this as well hopefully maybe uh David and them can put it for you guys in the comments or maybe he'll push you guys in the comments in there there's a bachelor just kind of copy it for yourself here all right so that's that so it gives it you see that gives it that boxer which is really good by the way which looks so good which I like a lot actually it's a very light back Shadow okay and then let's do an hover effect so on the hover I actually want to make it bigger so let's do on the hover now by the way do you know what this does what does this do do I might raise your hand if you know what this does raise your hand if you don't know what this does so this actually basically concatenates the hover to the parent which is the wrap it's kind of like doing it's kind of like doing for example wrap wrap hover that's what it's doing so basically this is concatenating hover to the wrap that's what it's doing just so you guys know okay all right on the hover let's go and change up the temperature let's do scale it so let's go ahead and scale it in the X and Y Direction so transform scale so scale just simply means make it bigger okay and then we'll change the Border color to be a little more different as well yes boom okay so now if I say this boom you see it's a little bit different now but of course we can make it better let's add a cursive point in this one cursor pointer pointer save that okay now now to cursor pointer which I like a lot awesome sweet God it looks so good guys it looks so awesome I love it all right that's cursor pointer and then what I want to do is I want to go ahead and change up the box Shadow here as well just a little bit foreign box just a little bit here not not not too much so it becomes a big it becomes a bigger box Shadow but to make this actually cleaner we're going to give it a transition boom so this is transition everything with two by the way this number remember this number I want you guys to remember this this is a big number here this number is actually used in a lot of transitions this is if you if you give it to if you give it a number higher than this it became becomes too slow if you give it a number less than this it becomes sometimes too fast so actually this number is actually used by a lot of developers this number 250 milliseconds so just keep this one in mind okay and this is the choose that you want to use right here cubic bizire desire all right save that and look now look at this you guys ready for this you guys ready are we ready hold on oh oh my God that looks so good oh oh so good oh this looks so good oh that looks great that looks amazing I love this one I love that one the Border changes transforms it oh looks so good how cool is that huh so that's pretty much that for you so look we finished the views but of course let's go ahead and change up these images so they're a little bit better a little better so if you have viewers Disney and then we have what viewers and Pixar let's go ahead and do Pixar here Pixar okay let's do Marvel and then we'll do Star Wars Star Wars okay and then we'll do National right here to National boom save that oh let's go that looks so good oh look at that guys but this is our ours that looks so good raise your hand with me if you're still with me and you're ready to continue on because that was pretty sick won't you agree with me on that one don't you agree that was pretty sick I will say hey let's go appreciate yourself hey let's go beautiful beautiful so we've got our viewers ready we've got our slider the next dance we're going to focus on is just basically the movies so our goal is to get these moves right here these ones right here you see these ones these ones that's going to be our goal now at this point and it's very simple let's go remove this rack slick okay that's the next one we're gonna focus on okay uh let's do that so let's go ahead and go to our vs code here let's do add again I want you guys to understand this one so add viewers right here let's go and add this to git commit again hopefully you guys used your git commit properly all right all right so let's go ahead and uh create new component let's do this one should be called uh movies Dot movies.js all right so rfce you know the drill okay boom create the movies let's call it movies movies awesome sweet so that's going to be a movie here all right so that's movies here all right save that and let's go now to uh let's import this into the home page okay so let's do back to the home page by the home page and let's import it so we'll say import um movies from what from movies all right that's the next one we're gonna create right right there and let's go ahead and use that one so we'll say movies here okay beautiful beautiful beautiful movies all right sweet I like it all right so I like it like that um that's amazing okay so just like music right here so movies that's all good let's go ahead and go now to the movies let's focus on that one so let's go ahead and save this and boom now we have we can see we have the moves right here so we create a component that's exactly what we need to do all right now this component is gonna be again not that hard of a component as well um let's go ahead and do our normal thing we'd like to do which is import style so I'm going to use style components of course import Stout from where import styled from from style Dash components stylish components components okay and then instead of doing return dip we'll do containers so we'll say container let's go all right at the bottom we have const container so let's do the following const container is equal to what styled dot dip okay okay so that's good all right nothing too crazy here uh let's get a little bit of padding here and this Penny what do you guys think this this penny is gonna be bottom padding so don't worry about so much about that one right all right uh next one is let's do H4 so we'll do an H4 here H4 let's do so this is gonna be a H4 heading let's do here recommend recommended for you oh no that's not what I want save that oh let's go that's beautiful it looks great that looks great I like that I like it like that I like it okay beautiful I like it it's a little bit big I feel like no I feel like it's a little bit bigger than what I like it will like to be but it's okay we'll fix that later don't worry about that recommended recommended by for you that's okay so next up let's go ahead um and create our content so as you know why our content is actually going to be here that this is our content right that's our content and that's going to continue the movie so to do that what we'll do is to create a Content component so look at a Content component right and the reason why we're doing this because it's going to make us to it's going to allow us to easily use a grid for example to wrap up our uh you know wrap up our list of stuff right so list of movies all right um okay let's go ahead and create a create a contact content is equal to style.div boom okay save that save that as good all right save that okay and it's all good right there beautiful so content styled dot edif that is pretty pretty awesome okay so let's do the following so now we'll do uh let's create for that content now every single movie just like how it was here is going to be a div as well see how this right here so every single movie here is also going to be a div and we're going to call it a wrap so let's do that here we'll say wrap wrap rap okay I will say here image source is equal to something well our image is going to be the following maybe hopefully maybe hopefully um maybe hopefully uh we can go on and comment this portion out for you guys or but this is going to be a temporary image that I'm going to use it's the is this image right here you see now maybe a month you guys can put it into the chat right here uh or put it into the the YouTube comments as well nothing nothing too much of a crazy solution situation but wraps undefined let's create a wrap right here constant wrap is equal to styled.div Boom all right save it all right this is the image we're going to use the Simpsons image for now now you can get it pretty much any anywhere you want right just go ahead and for example uh you know I'll copy image address I'll knock you I can put it to you guys in the chat I'm a cop yeah I can do it here for example I can put you guys in the chat and maybe for example let me see uh I've been putting two guys in the chat so you guys can all have it let me see that's the image we're going to use foreign and then maybe a month you can place that into the actual chat on YouTube That'll be amazing actually if you can do that that'll be very very helpful for so many people all right so if we have this let's do the same thing now but let's do multiple like multiple times let's do it like for example how many times do we need well we need it to be one two three four so four times actually so four times so we'll do the same thing we'll do four one two three four save that okay you can see right now it's horrible of course it makes sense right why it's horrible it's from left to right well to fix that again we're going to use grid to fix that right again let's do that so we're going to go on the content side and we're gonna say display display grid a grid okay I will say grid Dash Gap okay it was to be 25 pixels okay pixels and then here we'll say grid template columns so just how we've done different colors before we'll say the same thing here so grid Dash template Dash columns okay and we'll say repeat 4 comma min max right there zero comma one FR right so again same thing but just while repeating it four times boom look at that though so fast we've got our thing finished that's so great okay so that's amazing awesome all right so that's so good so now of course now we have the four cons which is um which is exactly what we want but just so now we need to fix the actual images themselves that's not an issue whatsoever so that means we go to wrap here and now on the image side just how we did it beforehand let's give it a width of a hundred percent little 100 that means it will fill up the full grid see what there see just like that it's fixed height of 100 percent 100 percent there okay that stretches the image a little bit so to fix that we do object fit object Dash fit Dash fits could be covered boom see it just object Fitness it will cover up the image within a div okay so we'll it will stretch out as much as possible without while keeping the aspect ratio of the actual image okay beautiful so we got that next thing let's go ahead and focus on the wrap uh let's give it a border radius because I kind of want that so border radius there's also gonna be 10 pixels all right that's that's great that's amazing so I like that SN pixels and then you can see now I know that I know technically if we save this doesn't show 10 pixels don't worry about that we'll make you show a second if I do overflow hidden hidden then it will show it the Border radius bull you see you see what happens again because the image just goes outside the border right and so when we do overflow hidden well then it can continue inside the actual dip beautiful all right next thing let's go ahead and do it gets give the ER a border the board I'm going to use is this one so border three pixels solid rgba with this one right here right so feel free feel free to copy of this one maybe or maybe a month after David maybe you guys can go ahead and copy this one into into somebody some somewhere all right next up a box shadow that's this one boom so again feel free to copy this box shadow in here feel free to copy this to anywhere you want it to be okay hopefully you guys can see that all right so that's box Shadow and honestly that's that's pretty pretty pretty much it that's nothing more crazier than that that's that looks pretty pretty damn good wouldn't you guys say so I would say so I kind of like that actually it's pretty pretty good I like that a lot actually all right so now this point let's do the following here okay I'll do the following here so we have the box Shadow we have the Border we have all of that that's amazing that's awesome let me go ahead and wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait what is this no that's good that's good that's good that's good okay next thing Let's do let's do a hover effect so on the hover again we're going to use this uh hover effect right here on the hover of this right boom right let's scale it a little bit a little bit just how we did it before previously transform scale okay save that boom and then let's do let's change the Border color of on this so on the hover of this all we do is we change the Border color to be this so basically it's a similar border color but it's a little more visible see it's a white white color that's what's gonna happen here so it's a white color that's a little more visible that's what's going to happen okay okay then we're going to change the box shell to be a little bit more prevalent as well all right that should be more a little more problems we'll do that to do let's go that's amazing I like that I like that and now see now boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom now right there that's exactly what we want but of course um we don't see you way too much because we need to do Transition so to do a transition we're going to see you use the same transition we used before transition all 250 milliseconds cubic bizire desire it's funny desire so feel free to copy this for yourself right here transition all 250 milliseconds cubic zire 0.25 0.46 0.45 is 0.940 seconds right there okay save that save that oh look at that and let's do a cursor pointer cursor pointer to actually do that it's a cursor pointer oh oh oh oh look at that how cool is that huh dude that's pretty slick guys okay okay that's pretty pretty slick okay I love that that looks so good that looks so good guys all right looks so good look at that the Box shot look at the transition it's so great I love that all right all right so who's still whipping guys you guys still with me yes or no yes yes beautiful I love seeing all your beautiful faces that makes me so so happy all right so we got that portion let's go ahead and look at this if I go ahead and copy this portion this whole thing and I paste it multiple times basically I just create more Simpsons so I create more movies that's that's all I'm doing so that is what our goal was was to create actually just simply just create this all right and uh well the home page I will honestly say is um kaput I mean in terms of design of course the logic not so much there yet but your design it's kapu it's funny it's done right so what I want to focus on so that's awesome so we have that and of course if these images are actually going to be replaced later on by images that come from a database so that's we're gonna we're going to do that later on a little bit but I want to work on a detail page now so let's go and work on a detail page now okay um so detail page so I will save this and let's look at the detail page now the detail page is basically going to be another component so let's go ahead and do here new file here and we'll do detail .js okay JS so that's going to be the detail detail one that we use so let's go ahead and do this so the rfce rfce beautiful create the detail component inside here which is exactly what we need and this will be detail all right sweet all right now how do we go and switch up between detail Peach and the home page good question um well it's going to be very very simple uh we're going to use something called react router Dom so what we need to do is we need to go to app.js and you see how we have the header home so by default it's just simply just throwing the header and the home well we need to change that to be to change to something called react water down so if I'm going to go to if I go to react router Dom here okay right right here you see that's what we need to use so this is what we need to do is react router down so we need to install into install install react water Dom again let's right click it open an integrate terminal right amp you install react part down beautiful nice nice nice nice nice nice nice I like it I like it I like it that's awesome okay all right let me show this hungry it's a lot you know um whoa that's what I'm talking about go left oh go before okay all right so that's good um so we installed we have a react rather down now to actually use it to use it as you can see we need to go ahead and actually import it like so so browse the router and software so let's go ahead and import that so import and you guys can do that on yourself here right there so you need to import right here browser router switch route and Link now the way this works is very simple and I'll show it to you here in a second how this works but red water is pretty much going to wrap your whole application around a route around a router and so we go ahead and we got the router um hold on right here I'm gonna do this router so the whole application is going to be right around the router okay but the fall to every single route will have a header page correct yes correct right so by default everything will have the header page right then what's going to happen is then we'll have multiple routes where either the home page or the detail page changes you can see for example if I click on the detail page here right the header does not change but what does change is this portion right that changes right so that's what we will achieve with this if I go ahead and if I click on this I want to say here now I'm going to say switch switch so again that's coming from directly from here you see that switch switch and switch just means it means okay you turn on this switch this to it this switch or this switch that's all it means and then we will go ahead and do a route so route if we see there's a the path is detail detail if the path is detail we will use the detail page so let's go ahead and do that I'm going to say import detail component from where components right components slash what detail boom voila all right next up so then we do detail like so detail so that will biscuit on the route where the path is slash detail we'll give it a detailed page however if the route is a home page for example like this or the path is actually just just home right there right and then it will have the home one a vhome component I just want to see how this works it's very simple right very simple we have a router that's this right anything that's inside the router will always be visible right so for example the header here will always be visible anything inside the switch case will always change so for example if I have a route here with the path details a path is basically the URL path as this path okay if it's detailed we go to detail page if it's homepage path is slash it's the home page raise your hand that makes sense does that make sense yes or no comprende yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes beautiful right that's going to be the home page and now let's go ahead and take a look at that all right so if I save this now technically I'm in the home page you see nothing really changed but if I go to slash detail boom we are on a detailed component you see the header still stays which is right here which is exactly we want to do right but the detail component which is this one says detail how sick is that what do you guys think you guys like that I think it's pretty cool all right so that's pretty cool so on the details now let's go ahead and focus on the detail page inside here well the detail page is a little bit longer than some other pages so here's what we'll do let's go ahead and do import styled from style components style Dash components okay so import style from style Dash components okay and a few things are going to happen here in the detail page of course let's go and make this a container as we like to do all the time so we'll say container container just like so all right beautiful not defined that's not a problem whatsoever so we say now const the phone will do the following so const container is equal to what oh is equal to style dot div right there okay start the div okay and this dialogue is going to be pretty pretty simple uh same thing we're gonna give it a Min height just how it did it for home so Min height I mean height I mean height I mean height is going to be calc a hundred vertical hey vertical height 100 VH minus 70 pixel step 70 pixels basically that's the that's that top bar right there okay awesome and then we'll get also pattern just how we did we give a pattern to the homepage too so padding which is this one so zero calc 3.5 for ver no VW basically means um width so basically that's the viewport width so 3.5 viewport width right there ah right there beautiful see all right so that's all good now of course if you think about this what does this have let's think about what does this specific thing have well it has a few things in terms of components well we have this this is the main component correct but this component is actually has a background you see it has a background image right so we can call the background image and then we have this kind of like logo and then we have I like to think of it as like a roll so right see you see I always think of I see things as rows and columns this to me is a row that contains multiple columns column of one button another button third button and fourth button right then we have another row that has this then another row that has the description basically of the thing do you understand that yes or no right yes all good yes yes yes yes yes good awesome sweet so that's what that has okay all right now and we can simply just honestly based on look at what we just have you can see we can do it so the first we need to create is the background is the background component so let's create the background component so we'll say background background boom background component and we'll give it an image source is equal to the following right and maybe if a monthly maybe because can help me out and actually give them this image source and this image stores again you can use any image source you want but in my in my case I have this one which maybe I can give it to you guys in chat here I'll go take us in chat boom that's the image I use okay that's the image I used let's just basically just this image right here all right okay that's the image and then so that's going to be the component if I go ahead and save that okay we have an error says background is not defined so it's a const const background is equal to styled dot div style.div the first other dip beautiful okay oh let's go look at that I mean it looks horrible but it's still it's kind of there right now adjust how I did our background image we're going to position it also fixed to the whole page so as we'll do we'll do the position fixed position fixed you see boom change right here we'll say top zero top zero right we'll say left zero just how I would like to do it left zero bottom zero right and then what a right zero right zero okay okay boom right there right zero okay now again it looks a little bit odd here I can see that right right there don't worry about that we'll make it work don't worry and then here's what we'll do in that case right so and then position fix about position fix to what well position fix to the actual container so we'll say here position relative remember if you're doing position absolute position fixed you have to use position relative because it will fix it to the relative parent kind of like you have to have a parent kind of like that you know you will have a parent right so position relative save that right nothing really changes here in the in those terms but what does change is the following look at this I'm going to now Target the image itself image right and I'm going to say here the image here is with a hundred percent with a hundred percent good and height of what of 100 as well okay I know it got stretched out but don't worry because what we can do is we can say object fit object Dash fit is gonna be what cover I want you guys to look into that cover boom see oh Moly Moly now you can see it just covered the whole thing right which is don't worry about that don't you know um so to prevent that from covering the whole thing it's very it's as simple as well I'll just put a z index minus one on it so that's it look okay Z index minus one and now the header shows as well and yeah that's it's as simple as that nothing too crazy you have to you have to honestly do let's add some more let's add a small opacity to something opacity fast is 0.8 oh so it's a little bit darker you see that a little bit darker and honestly that is that background image that is done comprende yes all good beautiful awesome sweet all right so I like that let's now go back to our what go back to our top and let's think about what else do we have well we also have this thing which is this which I like to call a title so so basically that's done now let's call let's you let's focus on this one right focusing down so that's going to be the title okay and we'll call it image title which title boom and we'll also give an image image source and I also have that source for now again this data will come later on from a database so don't worry about that okay then we're going to copy this image so you guys can all have it and I'll paste in the chat as well maybe a month a month after div you can paste it in the comments on YouTube as well that'd be awesome thank you okay I'm gonna paste it here boom okay all right so that's gonna be that all right let's go to our application here so it's the images are not defined of course we Define it in using style.div nothing crazy here let's do the following and we say what image title and no Define it first image title is equal to styled dot div done oh let's go that looks like I mean not that much but it's not bad again we can also use some really really cool things with that right so image Title Here we're going to give it a height of 30 VH protocol height okay right and don't worry about it we'll focusate on the image and then we'll we'll give the image so here's here's the thing with images give it a parent container and then on the image say with 100 and do object fit that is your recipe for any good image sizing give a parent container right a container to contain once you've done that on the image say with 100 100 and then give it an object fit that is your your goto that should be your goto okay so do image same thing with a hundred percent okay a height of a hundred percent yeah look at this object fixed this time the however contained right boom big difference huh much big difference much big difference right don't worry we'll make it a better even right now so as we'll do I'll do uh width of this one is going to be 35 BW viewport with right there see that makes it even better and then we give it a minute let's go ahead and give it a Min height just in case main height main height of 170 pixels beautiful and then we'll do a main width of 200 pixels men with of 200 pixels all right so nothing created just has changed but all we know is that this is working this image is great right so let's uh we're getting very close to where we want to get to all right next up what we need to do is next up is we need to go ahead and focus on what that's going to be kind of like this content right here all this content right here I want to focus now on the controls you see this on the controls so let's go ahead and focus on the controls here so I want to say the following I'm going to say here controls let's go ahead and do ah controls right here I'm going to create the controls con so controls oh controls controls container boom controls and all that will simply do is very simple let's go ahead and that will contain the play button and stuff like that right so let's go ahead and install that div foreign controls const controls is equal to styled dot div okay and inside here it's very simple we have four buttons here one two three four okay one two three on that side it's very simple now at this point we need to create four buttons One's Gonna Be the play button so when you hear the play button okay got crushed on it then we do the trailer button trailer button okay and then we have the add button so let's go ahead and add that one too add button beautiful and then we have the group watch button oh watch button go watch button there we go awesome sweet so that's kind of that so group watch button is what we're focusing on right now at this point okay let's go ahead and create all these buttons right right so let's go ahead and do the bottom let's go to the bottom we don't need any of this just yet okay let's go to the bottom and we'll just go ahead and focus on the buttons himself so let's do the following so here we'll say const play button right is equal to styled dot div right that's that okay next one's gonna be which one next is going to be the trailer button so it's a const triller button foreign same thing here NASA is going to be const which one the add button right here and that's going to go to styled.div as well dot div boom nice last one is going to be the group watch button oop oops oopsie Daisy group watch button is equal to also style that div all right let's see what these now have inside okay so let's try this let's go and take a look at this nothing they have absolutely nothing but also we made it with small mistakes because this needs actually be a button so we need to go call this button not this but but you see button button button button okay so that's it we've got ourselves a bug that have nothing inside them right now but we'll fix that here in a little bit okay so let's go and take a look at the actual buttons on what we need to have inside them well the button will Purge part one the bodies will have uh kind of like things inside of it right so every single button well let's look at the play button first for example here so play button has what the play icon and the text play so we'll give it an image here so we'll do image image source is equal to equal to what is equal to Dash images okay Dash the play icon black button that we have actually inside our images which we downloaded by the way right here boom okay so that's the one we need to use okay that's gonna be our images inside the play button and then we need to go ahead and create a span and that's going to say play right there play as component capitalized so it's easier for us yeah let's look at this oh let's go it looks so bad but it's there right let's do the same thing with the trailer Button as well so we can focus on two at the same time okay so do the trailer button at the same time same thing with this one that's going to copy this image put it in the trailer button right but this time the trailer button is going to be play icon White not black but white this one hopefully you guys are still with me all right and then we have what then we have the span right now spinning so old it's just a wrapper and that will be what the Thriller button that's it okay all right so now we have two buttons you can see here one is trillion one is played they have different styling for them so that's what we need to what we need to focus on now at this point let's go let's go now to our play button and a few things that we need to focus on on the play button well a few things let's think about part one let's think about the Border radius right so we need to go ahead because it kind of looks horrible right now so do border radius radius right and let's give it four pixels body radius so it's a little bit cleaner and software so what it is four pixels and so forth okay next up let's change the font size of this so we'll do font size just a bit of a more of a font size okay all right so it's a little bit bigger now at the same time now you can see how these play buttons oh look let me go ahead and remove this portion right here we don't need that you see this butt play button so you see how they're not kind of like aligned aligned uh horizontal vertically correct so we can do this use display flag so it's in display Flex foreign tically align them okay oh don't worry about that don't worry about that that's fine and I will say here align items a line line a line with their items Center boom boom you see now the play button is aligned now let's go ahead and make sure that all of these but are aligned horizontally as well to do that we do go to controls and I say here display Flex display Flex flex and what do we say you see that puts them in a in a row by row fashion because by default the flex direction is rho not column you see and so we go that puts them into like the it's one row basically right into one row all right so that's good Flex direction is basically in the one row now let's go ahead and do the following for the play button let's give it a height let's go to height or 56 pixels all right so it's a little bit a little bit bigger okay and let's uh do the following let's go ahead and give a um let's think about this here for a second I will go ahead and actually say background color it's good just change the background color for this one so say background color I'll just do this boom so background color should be that now of course it's not that just yet let's go ahead and remove the Border border border can you see how we had the Border that's a hideous right now hey there we go so much better look at that so much better all right let's also add a little bit species on the left hand side and the right hand side and to do that all we do is we simply just do uh padding right so we do padding so padding zero pixels on the top or bottom and the butt on the left and right will do 24 pixels simple as that right there see and now let's go ahead and add um uh let's add some margins so let's do margin right you see to make sure that it pushes this trailer one so we'll do a margin right here margin Dash right like this and we'll give it a 24 22 pixel margin oh boom done look at that it's already getting much much better than what we'll want to do let's also in terms of color the black color that's all good I like that uh let me think about what else do well so we think should we do let's add some lighter spacing let's change that up a little bit here as well so letter spacing just to space it out a little bit more spacing and we'll do 1.8 pixels right just spaces out just a bit more just more so it's yeah I like that a lot better actually yeah I like a lot better and that's good okay that's awesome and let's of course let's make it a cursor pointer too right so that means when I can click on it when I can hover over it because right now it's not a cursor pointer right so let's do cursor pointer cursor let's do a pointer boom all right oh something happened oh right here right there so now if I hold it see it's a cursor pointed now okay good so now we're not there yet okay not there yet I like that now let's go look at the back let's glue now let's think about the hover uh solution so on the hover of this we're going to use this again so on the hover of this on this whole button we're going to change the background color just a little bit right so here background see this boom so now oh boom boom boom you see it right there boom boom okay good so I like that that's amazing that's awesome now the same thing is gonna happen with the trailer button right with the trailer button now check this portion out the trailer button right has the same style as this except it changes a few things like for example the background color well check out what we can do we can actually import it we can actually use like for example it's kind of like polymorphism you know in classes but in our case we can actually kind of like import the style so I'll do styled play button look at this style play button see now it's the same great great great great way but all I gotta do if you need to know in order to change color all I do is the following I say background is going to be the following so it's the back is going to be a little bit more darker here foreign and we're almost done guys guys we're almost done for today by the way just want to let you guys know that almost done okay I like that let's do a little bit give it a little bit more of a border so I I like that too more of a border one pixel solid so kind of like a white border as well and let's go ahead and let's do the following let's do a color so let's go ahead and do more of a white color I guess like a more of a lighter white color boom look at that oh let's go now of course also I kind of want to if I go to here Ah that's fine that's great oh let's go guys how cool does that look now all right uh let's make sure this text text transform actually let's do text transform uppercase so make sure it's text transformed to make sure it's all applications text transform this form let's do uppercase to make sure it's all uppercase okay save that boom done holy man look at this guys that's so good okay so I like that so play Trilla that's all there I love that portion okay let me go let me go I'll call this close this out we have a few more ones which is going to be the add button so far let's go ahead and focus on the add button which looks a little bit more different right it has like it only has it's just one icon right so in the add button all we're going to do is just simply just an image so that's all we'll do so in the ad and the uh in uh the add button and all that will be is simply just like a background a background image let me let me think about this for a second here so in the app add list button uh it would just be like a plus that we need to go ahead and add and that's pretty much it so if you look at it here look at this inspect you see here we have this span span so it actually creates like a really interesting solution but I don't want to do it that way actually I actually want to do a little bit differently you see I'm going to just simply do a plus icon or just just simply just a plus that we're going to use inside our thing so look at this I'll see I will say here as I will say span I will say here span oops span plus right I know nothing crazy so far right but don't worry it's gonna happen right so to make this this one happen what's gonna happen is we're gonna give it a height and a width as well so let's go to the add button okay let's go ahead and give it a width all 44 pixels let's give it a height of 44 pixels okay good so that's that's awesome sweets that makes me that makes me happy next up uh let's go ahead and just how did it in the other one let's go ahead and do uh display Flex play Flex right okay and now let's focus on the span as you span here let's do spin and let's change the font size of this one to be more so font size this would be maybe 16 pixels 18 pixels let's see maybe maybe more what do you guys think 24 pixels 26 pixels yeah it's about that ah I would say 30. there we go much better right all right so display Flex we're gonna do now align item Center to align everything inside there horizontally or vertically align Center okay and then we'll do Justified Contest Center to do align it horizontal all right so justify content Center foreign justify content Justified that content is going to be Center done so that that's a very nicely centered uh so forth let's do border release to give it a nice circular border for this radius 50 of course nice look at that it's time to look a button right I like that all right so that's really cool that's really cool motor radius all right and let's go ahead and do a background let's do that let's do background let's give it a border actually border of white so border here is gonna be white okay so it's a white border that's awesome let's give it a different background color too a background color should be this as well done look at that right let's also do a color white color white on the actual span oh let's go look at that and then we'll do a cursor pointer on the actual full button so we'll do cursor cursor pointer boom right there and honestly that's that's pretty pretty much it we'll do here again there we go and then we'll do a margin right of 16 pixels to push the other button away so margin margin Dash right will be 16 pixels good so let's go ahead and save that all right save that all right it's going to refresh that beautiful oh it looks so good so good now you can see here that this button is not vertically aligned with all these other ones you see how it's kind of more the top versus more centered so how would we go ahead and do that to make sure it's fully centered well that's a very very simple solution honestly again display Flex so to do that we go to our parent which is the controls the controls controls the controls controls everything right so we go to controls errors and controls display flags and we do align items look at this Center and watch it boom you see this just became centered just like that it's so simple right so that's right there is going to be our plus plus button all right last button that we're going to focus on is going to be that's our button right there let me see right there last one is going to be the group watch button okay and I think it probably is the Sim similar button that we should use a music coupon button but this one's gonna have an image so let's try that right out so this one has an image right here so group watch button okay let's add an image here okay and we'll get a source is equal to okay is equal to what well we have a group icon that we can use right there so this is in your images folder if you downloaded it from the drive right there okay that's your image okay so that's good group watch button I like that that's awesome and again we'll do the same thing I think I think it's worth doing like the same thing which is also with 44 pixels and everything everything's pretty much uh you know similar so let's try that so we'll do I think we can probably let me see I can probably use styled actually this add button look at this guys I button oops no this other one okay so that's good all we need to do is just differentiate the color a little bit a little bit because you can see here it's a little more darker color here so we'll differentiate the color here just a little bit but giving it a darker a darker background color which is actually more of a more of a it's actually more of a background color black boom boom done done done that's it done look at that oh oh oh how good is that what do you guys think are you guys still with it yes or no we've got ourselves you see well very slowly we're turning out to have an amazing solution here an amazing product like you know little by little we have CSS going so far look at this guys all right look at all these CSS we just did all using style components that's pretty pretty epic I will say so all right and we're not too far off from actually being fully done right now we have a subtitle that I'm gonna do description and that's pretty pretty much it so let's go ahead and do that let's go finish this up let's finish it up with a button you guys oh oh all right let's take a bottle break all right beautiful that's amazing that's exactly what I'm talking about all right last thing that we go ahead I need to do is well it's the following okay so let's go ahead and take a look at it all right by the way how is Facebook doing how's YouTube doing by the way let's see we got 400 people 224 people on YouTube still let's go that's amazing good to see all of you guys so good to see all of you guys so many people you guys are commenting nonstop every single time that's awesome that's awesome someone said you had to hide the arrows while arrows no I didn't do not do not need to hide anything I've got everything here I need fully all right all right let's go ahead and do one last thing here that we need to go ahead and do all right by the way guys on YouTube can we please get to a thousand likes is that possible can we get to a thousand likes on YouTube That'll be amazing those of you on Zoom are you guys pumped yes or no with me raise your hand raise your hand if you're still with me yes yes yes beautiful that's what I'm talking about all right next thing oh we need to kind of focus on is going to be now this detail page which is a list page right here I can actually just copy this for now temporarily I'm going to copy this and I'm going to call a subtitle here so let's go ahead and create a subtitle component so let's go ahead and do this so we'll do subtitle here actually not not inside the controls but actually it's outside of control so we'll do subtitle sub sub title okay I subtitle and that's going to contain the actual text which is this is temporary text okay placeholder text that's what that's all we know okay and then inside there we're going to create the description and I'll give you guys you know the actual text if you need text but you can put anything you want in there right you you don't even need just put anything you want let's just that's temporary until we actually get it from the database so for now just put anything you want in there okay so that's Shin okay all right let's go and copy this right boom done nothing too fancy like I said right nothing too fancy at all all right of course when if we go back to our application says something that's not defined that's the normal usual thing so what we need to do we need to Define it so we'll say the following so do style.div so const subtitle go ahead make sure you guys can see the top here subtitle is equal to styled dot div beautiful style that dip awesome sweet nice so let's start the dev and that's amazing let's do something with the same thing with description const ipation is equal to styled dot div as well all right all right Maddie's oh what just happened what happened description the heck I did not okay good wait holy moly I will not just kill the whole application with this that'd be funny if I did though all right so for the subtitle it shouldn't be anything too crazy let's go ahead and um change the color just be a little bit more of a lighter color so I'm gonna do command click on this command click and this takes me the actual style so that's one thing you actually can use color which is this color okay save that it's a just very light color Okay font size 15 pixels find this if so let's go ahead make this a little bit there you go a smaller font size let's do Min height uh main height of 20 pixels as well okay let's also give a margin top margin top let's do margin top margin top 26 pixels to give it a a uh what's it called there we go just to push a little more to the bottom here you see just to push it more to the bottom right here I like that okay snap pushes more to the bottom and then same thing with description let's go ahead and do that so now if we're in description let's look at the description here okay awesome that's pretty simple similar one as well right uh let's do we'll change the line height here for a little bit so we'll do line height line height or say 1.4 so so it creates more of a spacing you see I kind of like that a lot more let's do fonts let's give it more of a font size a bigger font size so font size 20 pixels so it's a bigger text boom beautiful let's do padding top is going to be so we'll do margin top is actually going to be much top 16 pixels boom nice I like that awesome sweet let's do the same thing with the color right there same with the color ah yes and well I mean that's that's pretty much it look at that holy moly let's go that's pretty much it guys how cool is that what do you guys think we have ourselves a detail page now yes it does not connect directly to the thing that's gonna have the connection is gonna happen tomorrow the whole Redux all of that that's gonna happen tomorrow although Redux connecting right you know the reactor down with three Ducks actually pull and then data from a Firebase that's going to happen tomorrow who's excited for that let me know in the comments below who decide for that one that's gonna be pretty cool that's pretty cool it's not easy but we'll do it all right and the last thing that I kind of maybe want to touch on is potentially the login page so let's go and touch on the login page I think they'll be a lot of fun as well okay login page should not be anything too crazy so we'll just touch on the login page a little bit as well so what we have here well we have the detail page which is here boom okay we have ourselves at the detail page oh that's the home page then we have the detail page okay and then let's go ahead and create a login page uh well a login page as well with this all right let me see so to do this let's go and create a login component so let's go ahead first is first let's go ahead and do add detail page and uh detail page in our commit as always okay and let's do this let's do components let's do a login page so right click new file we'll do login .js boom login.js let's do rfce boom that creates the login page and so forth right okay so that's going to be the login page okay and then what we'll do is very simple we'll to make this happen let's go to our home to our app.js and if there's a route that says the login route we'll just take it there so say route path is equal to what let's just say login slash login and what do we do what do we do well we import the login component so we say import login from where from dot dash components Dash what login dunzo okay so marginal file you tend to import components let me see components of log and I create one oh it should be there let me see outside the project folder all because of this right here done done ah awesome sweet let's go and do that awesome so that's good and so now we go to this you should we should use the logging components let's try to try that login component oh done all right let's go and go now let's go to our logging component oh let's go login boom login is what we got and if we go to login in the in our actual build function sign out here's our login component you can see not you know nothing nothing crazy so far okay nothing crazy so far and this is where we will be very smart okay you can see how the header is still the same but it changes when the login point is different so we'll do that tomorrow that's part of Redux we'll have we'll make that tomorrow but today is we'll focus on this portion right here right we'll focus on this push we'll create this button which is beautiful we'll create this image right here and then this stuff right here as well so a few different things I welcome to create right now so let's go look into well what components do we have for this well few things we have the actual container that's the width 100 right okay then what I like to let me go ahead and put a rectangle here so we have this okay and then we have I like to call the content section why because it gets centered horizontally and vertically you see if I go ahead and look at the brush see it gets sent horizontally centered and also vertically right that's that right and then of course inside that we have a few different things we have well what do we have we have a few logos so we have a kind of like uh let me see I'm going to rectangle here the logo here that's going to become that's going to be component that we're going to use as well then let me see let me see then we have a button called get all there button okay and then finally we have a description get Premiere access and then finally we have another logo code like this that's it that's pretty much it so uh with that being said let's just look into what we do so let's go to login page it's got a login page I mean a lot of is hideous right now but but Logan page let's start up with the container okay so oh let's go and import style so import styled guys we're almost done we're going to create the login page and then we're almost done for today and then we'll finish up tomorrow okay so import styled from style Dash component okay all right from stylish components okay that's awesome and this one let's go ahead and create a container here okay let's do const container is equal to styled dot div beautiful style.df that's amazing okay so now okay a few things are gonna happen here at this point let's do the same thing remember in the con in specific container we need to one is we need to kind of change up this image which is a pretty cool image that's pretty pretty sweet and we need to add that background image in a little bit here so let's go ahead and add a uh well we can do a few things here the same thing we did before remember how we did that before let's do it right now so inside here look at this let's do a before just we'll do before so we'll do position relative here position relative okay and we'll do the whole before thing which is what did the last time to add those background images right so we did like this put it like this before right like so right and of course number one I need to give this uh the container to give this a height so the height for this one is gonna be just how did the last time is a hundred VH minus 70 pixels done done okay 100 VH minus 70 pixels that's going to be just how we had to follow these other ones we do the same thing for this one okay okay good before so that's gonna be this relative now before with this specific specific one is we're going to add a background image so let's go and do this so we'll say here we'll say position absolute absolute absolute I will say top zero zero we'll say bottom zero bottom zero okay we'll say content is nothing comes with nothing right the Jaws that we had in the detail page right by the site is just in this case we had the background was like you know we used an image inside that which is completely fine don't worry about that right content is nothing and then we will say go ahead and then bottom left zero right zero as well zero good all right and now check this out now right all right that's supposed to and then we'll do of course this to hold the whole Z index now now this point that's pretty much good so position relative on that that's all good I like the height here nothing crazy here let's do a background image now so say background Dash image okay and we'll give it this URL that's the login we have a background image so we have a special login background image that we have which looks a little bit like this boom right now you don't really see it right now don't worry about that so what's gonna happen now this point is default position absolute top zero bottom zero left zero right zero okay let me make sure it's all good that's all great position before they created before all right let me see or maybe it's after no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no it's like this wait wait wait um it's after hold on before there's no before here that's interesting maybe it's after here let me see maybe it's after you guys see what I'm talking about let's see hmm see how did I do before let me see am I missing something here before no technically it's good like this before back on URL same thing that was the image slider right here before foreign fixed position absolute top right content zero position relative okay bottom zero okay that's interesting all right let's see so before let's go back to our login page yeah that's right but to our login page here do command P to go back to login okay so the content nothing top zero bottom zero left zero is your background image is that one so do like this okay let's see just don't understand why it's not editing before content let me see content hmm that's very interesting I don't understand why okay let me move this image for now okay what if I do exactly the way I had it before before I don't understand why otherwise it would just not work let's go to log in the Js log in the Gs let's see you guys do you guys see any issues that I don't see or no or am I blind to this wait now it has a before now I did so what was I doing before that was not right what what I do before same Ampersand Time same colon same before what oh man this is not cool anyway special absolute good okay well I mean I'm not sure without bite that hat but that made that that happens sometimes it's a cold not semicolon absolute is a colon not semicolon oh is that why because I had this one wrong okay interesting so probably because of the thing okay that's fine so let's go ahead and in our login that that makes sense okay so we'll change the background image I do not need this right now good it's a background image Dash image boom oh there we go so much better we'll do a background position top position top okay so start from the top we'll do a background size cover so it covers the full thing so background round size cover okay nice I like every size cover and then Becca said no repeat so does not repeat basically the whole thing at all no repeat no repeat beautiful and that's it we've got ourselves a background which just looks so good now again this right here we'll change later on okay the most important thing is now let's go ahead and change up this stuff so now we need so we have this portion which is great let's focus now on the the actual what's it called the actual content so let's create the content which I'm gonna call the content yeah I'm gonna call it the content box content box that's what I'm gonna call it the content box Okay so content box right here beautiful content box and inside this content box is where for example our logos will be so for example actually maybe let's call it CTA box some of this a call to action box SATA what do you guys think maybe call a CTA for now CTA and inside here we'll have what will have the following we'll have CTA logo one so let's do this CTA logo one as could be an image and then there'll also be a CDA logo two later on so let's start with the CTA logo one which has a source we'll say source is equal to first is equal to right here and there will be right here CTA logo one which we have in our images folder boom done right there CTA okay and I'm just so if you go back to here of course we have an issue here so CTA that means you to create a stock component so let's do so let's go ahead and do this so we'll do const CTA CTA equals styled dot div okay that's part one and then CTA logo one is going to be an image so okay const CTA logo one is equal to what style dot image boom boom hey right there it's okay don't worry this refresh this will work okay good awesome so that's fine that's awesome no problem whatsoever so now with this specific thing let's go ahead and I kind of wanted a um let me think about this here what height should we give it I think we should give it a a specific height I think we should give it I should give it a specific uh height and width so let's do this for the CTA let's do a Max width Max was good to do some Max with of 650 pixels for example okay awesome and I also want to give it a specific uh let's do a top a specific padding on specific padding so let's do padding so top is going to be 80 pixels top bottom 80 pixels and left and right are going to be 40 pixels all right there you see I like that okay now so you see this kind of becomes that the whole dynamic here uh but actually yeah that's right yeah that's right yeah so now to make it all work properly what we need to do is uh we need to on this container we need to give the position not position but display Flex Flex to make sure it's all centered and then oh well we'll just go display Flex I know where I just went and then we'll do a line item Center where did the thing just go where'd you go don't leave all right so I'll bring it back okay that's interesting so if I don't if I don't do display Flex it's fine this play relax all right that's fine that's a Justified content maybe as well justify content Center hmm Max with I don't like the fact that CTA is just not showing up just kind of like that so that doesn't make sense at all um this one said the DF that's this one before oh it's here just it does not have a width that's why that's fine we'll give it a whisp we'll give it with right now uh let's give it a width of 58 let's get a width with all let's just say 50 percent there we go let's do more like 60 or something there we go maybe 70. there we go I like that okay that's good I like that okay and of course it's centered right there but you know then once we put another stuff it'll be centered normally so okay just for kind of sentence that's basically it's fully center now in this position that's amazing I like that portion the next I need to do is create the sign up button so that will be inside here so we'll do sign up sign up so create a sign up button so sign up sign up right there and then inside here we'll say get all there remember just like how they had it here so get all there get all there let's increase this width a little bit more maybe like 80 I would say so okay same thing let's do const sign up equals styled dot what style Dot style dot it's gonna be actually it looks like it's an a tag actually it's an a tag right there done right there see all right awesome sweet sweet so that is all great um I like that portion nice so that's gonna be good next thing let's go ahead and actually make that make this into a proper button well to make that happen they get all there we need to give the number one a specific width so let's do that so we'll say width width of a hundred percent okay that's fine I will do a background color and we'll give it this background color which is this one bull right there save that okay again not not nothing crazy right now right but that's again nothing don't worry about that just yet okay we'll do font away here bold font wait bold okay and then what we want to do is inside this CTA is we need to we want to display Flex on this one so to the cell so if we display Flex on this one and no that's the only way to make this a tag all the way fully uh full width display Flex through this out right right so I know this one to the left hand side to the right hand side but to fix that what we do is do Flex Direction so Flex Direction column yeah column right that's not to fix the the top to bottom see now it's fully kind of like top and bottom and so forth okay so I like that PlayStation column and then what I want to do is I want to give it a some kind of uh what's it called the the actual sign up button I want to give it a a padding a top padding so let's do this so right here we'll do padding 17 pixels oops to give it a top and bottom pixel and zero picks on the left and right oh no not that one hold on not here not on the button here my bad good good good good good good good good I like it I like it I like it like Dutch oh yes I do like it like that beautiful so at that point that's all good uh let's go ahead and change the color here just a little bit more so we'll do color that's awesome let's change the colors a little bit more boom right there okay okay let's get a border radius okay again to get those curvature a little bit you can see guys like all we're doing is CSS right now it's crazy huh border radius and I'll make it four pixels nice look at that next let's go ahead and do a text align Center oh let's go look at that would you look at that that's pretty awesome let's give the boy a what's it called a I mean I don't know let's give it a border don't don't worry about the Border just yet so that's good let's do a font size let's change the font size here a little bit so font there's size font size 18 pixels so it's a little bit bigger okay I like that I like that let's do a cursor pointer so that let's do a cursor Point down here cursor pointer okay so that boom it's a button now awesome sweet let's go ahead and that's pretty good so I like that portion let's do now at this point let's go ahead and let me see let me think about this here let's do a uh yeah that's pretty good let's do a hover effect so if I go hover over on this now so I'm going to say hover hover what are we gonna change well what we want to change is actually the missing about this you see you want to change the background color a little bit here that's the that's what I do so let's do it right now so on the hover of this let's change the background background to be this specific one good save that boom boom boom boom boom boom we could do a small transition even at this point too so we'll do another example transition all and then you can do things like for example uh 250 milliseconds there boom you see much better okay awesome sweet I like that and that looks to be all good let's do letter spacing let's face this out a little bit so ladder spacing of 1.5 pixels nice so it's a little bit bigger now you see that guys you see that beautiful that's all there okay all right so that's I like that let's go ahead maybe add a margin top let's do margin top margin Dash top maybe like let's just say 8 pixels there we go just space that just a little bit more and let's do margin bottom 12 pixels so margin margin bottom for the next element done all right there we go awesome so that's all good next up next up is we have this kind of stuff right here nothing too crazy here so let's do the following so the description that's called description so I'll add the description here so we'll call description component corruption component right there description component and then I'm going to copy this you guys can go ahead and copy this for yourself as well again you can put anything you want in here like you have right here description and I'll post it paste on you guys for the chat let's go ahead right there I will paste the description for you guys here boom done all right that's the description I'm going to create a description component that's the next thing so we need to do const description right is equal to what styled styled that what that div right that's what we need to create and then once we have that actually knows do style.p a P tag let's use because you use it so you see when you style components you can use P tag a tags pretty much anything at this point that's awesome all right I like that so that's good let's go ahead and do the following now we do color colors girls could do font size 11 pixels 11 pixels make it a lot smaller there we go let's do um let's do line height let's do letter space actually letter spacing we'll make it um 1.5 pixels just spread up just a little bit nice I like it we'll also do text align Center text align Center nice I like it I like it like that oh beautiful nice and and then let's see uh line height 1.5 let's see line height 1.5 save that boom all right so much better I like that and then there we have finally at that point we have our last one let's go ahead and make this a little bit bigger again I keep wanting to make this like 90 or something you know I know why and then we'll move this up to the bottom we'll move this up a little bit too later on don't worry good awesome I like that that's not and then we have finding the last logo of the day it's gonna be CTA logo two so let's do that right now solder here so how did the TTA logo one I'm going to copy this portion right here I'm going to put it into here so CDA logo two and this is going to be logo two which is this one two done guys we're almost done almost done it's insane almost so close so glad you're So Far So Close you're so far all right all right same thing with this one CT basically it's gonna be the same one as uh yeah logo two go and do this all right oh wait wait I Define let's define His Image so CTO logo too const uh CTA oops CTA logo 2. equals dialed dot image there you go check this out now hold on oh it's not there that's okay let's go and take a look at it again CJ local to oh because PNG not SVG my bad oh let's go beautiful let's make it a little bit smaller I want to make it just a little bit smaller um and to do that I'm just going to add some padding on the right at the left and the right okay so let's do that around this one so I'm going to say here oh actually no this is good honestly I kind of like it though I kind of like this I want to start this more uh this is kind of vertically bonus out of this better a little bit better so we did do a line out of Center but I would rather do it kind of line items top here right minus top just how we have it here and then that's part one and then I kind of want to do it where uh that's pretty good I like that I like that and I'm gonna do opacity here opacity here let's say 0.8 a bit more 0.7 just a little bit more of a darker theme you see I like that let's do a margin top actually on this whole shebang so let's do let me see let me think about this actually I kind of like that maybe let's do margin top on this specific thing marched up on the whole container I'll do a margin top oops something just happened margin top I'm almost done guys here's some margin that's top monitors topless to 200 pixels no not this one on the content itself GTA here the goal almost done no let's do 150. no let's do a hundred and we're there guys that is pretty much it look at that oh that looks good maybe maybe make actually let's maybe make this image maybe make this a little bit smaller maybe let me see a width of let's see wait 90 percent and there we go and then inside here we'll go ahead and do T da da just like content is d8 so we'll do Justified content in the CTA to make sure it's all good Justified no actually align item Center align item Center you see how currently it's not aligned like this you see you see how let me go ahead and remove this for you guys um you secretly it's not aligned or horizontally well we can maybe we can fix it by saying item Center but yeah right there see but not see usually when you do when you do horizontal a line you want to use Justified content Center but because we did a flex Direction column right and then they switch align items changes to horizontal Direction just if a Content changes the vertical Direction so it's actually the switch in terms of uh yeah I know it's just weird like that for some reason but yeah that's pretty much it guys look at this we have ourselves the the image we have ourselves everything we have ourselves I know it's a little weird because we have the login so let's take a look at what do we have look at this we have all you guys who are on hold on guys we've finished we finished the login the home page we finished the the detail page all it's done is tomorrow we connect them all together all that happens is tomorrow we create Redux to connect the data we use Firebase to get the data from Firebase then we basically set the movies to actually basically so when I go for example here to movies here let's go ahead and do the home page here right I want to be able to see actual actual movies on here not just movies that are you know images and then I should be able to log in log out no problem whatsoever like when I should be able to log out from here log in using fibers authentication and you guys will learn all of that tomorrow how sick is that who's excited guys check this out we've done all this look at this let's go detail here slash detail page sagittal page foam oh not that one hold on detail holy moly this is exciting oh so good let's give it a command uh boom oh let's kill the action I need to give this a Max width actually yeah we'll we'll do that tomorrow don't worry guys the max width let's actually give the max to itself what is it what is the max width of this thing should be maybe 700 pixels 900 pixels I think so let's go to the detail page let's fix this for a second here just go here detail boom let's fix the description here this one Max width Max width what is it 500 pixels what do you guys think here yeah see now let's do a 760. I like that better but my dad that's so much better awesome look at that oh that looks so good let's give let's actually give this logo a little bit more of a margin top I like that this uh image title let's give that image title a little bit larger top so let's do oh margin top it will do 20 pixels oh now let's do a margin top Maybe 40. let's do 100 no 60 pixels oh let's go there we go that looks so good if we now go to our home page what do we have we have ourselves movies whoa look at that we can hover over them you can go to next ones this is application that we built I can hover over these look at this oh that looks so good let's go raise your hand if if you thought that was epic raise your hand Juliana did you were able to actually fully finish it with me Juliana yeah partially partially that's awesome guys for those of you who did not were not able to finish it don't worry this the recording is you know it's through zoom and it's also on YouTube it's actually on YouTube right here so if you were not able to finish it no problem guys that's pretty much it for YouTube people guys we are currently what we're still at what 200 people watching guys this is insane insane I will say guys pretty much the best the best thing I've done like this is I mean this is so much fun for me personally look at what we've built here look at what we have done I mean this is like hold on this is pretty much like the best thing of I mean I don't know I have so much fun did you guys have fun raise your have you had fun doing this raise your hand if you had fun building this application guys yeah there we go all right for those of you who are on YouTube guys for those of you who are on the zoom stay tuned make sure you stay on Zoom okay I'm unit no I cannot be hold on hello hello hello can you guys hear me can you guys hear me or no oh there we go I know what happened there but for some reason got muted on on the thing let me make sure I don't know why I just actually oh don't do it just yet bro not yet not yet bro not yet bro okay okay let me show because I cannot hear myself at this point hold on uh uh okay can you hear me can you talk okay good so yeah guys like I said for those of you guys uh those of you guys who are on YouTube this was a ton of fun right part two is gonna be for tomorrow if you want to join our react.js challenge that is where we're building this whole thing right if you want to join us go ahead and join us down below in the description below right join the JavaScript Challenge and we'll finish this up fully to the event we did this Disney clone part one tomorrow Disney Club part two we're finishing up this whole thing we'll be able to deploy it and actually use it together right on top of that on top of that we'll be talking about how to become a full stack developer a full stack developer with react.js in 2021 so go ahead and click the link below there should be a react.js challenge link to join if you're interested I got guys other than that it has been pretty it's been fun I would say it's been fun guys uh those of you on YouTube like I said a lot of fun thank you guys so much a thousand likes to reach let's go that's amazing thank you so much so much for all the energy you guys put into this right it has been a ton of fun I really enjoyed it guys so yeah have yourselves a great day today the Disney clone that you see right here we had day one in the previous video where we focused on building up the home page like this we focus on building the login page that looks like this right here login we also focus on building the the detail page it looks like this as well so right there and we've done all this yesterday and day one so if you're interested we have a video and down in the description below for you to go ahead and check out but other than that let's go ahead and continue with what we're doing so like I said our goal is to be able to get to this right we are building a Disney clone we have a react slick for react slider which looks like this we are using Firebase for authentication right here right we're using beautiful animations with CSS if you scroll down right here oh if you click on something to be able to get to the next page we are using react water down right here beautiful right and if we go to login so let's go and sign out here for a second if I click login again this using Firebase authentication beautiful and to keep to make all this work to keep the state managed we are using Redux for State Management common together it's all working so beautiful so nicely it is user friendly it is mobile friendly and so we're just going to continue on with building this beautiful um from the last time from the last time what have we done from the last time we have our project that's basically like this right here right as our project we have a few files we have the main files let me go ahead and show it to you here detail home page right here home page header image slider login movies and viewers right and all this contribute to application that is pretty much the way it is right now nothing crazy so far because right now our goal is very simple the number one goal I'm going to do is you see how these movies right now are just static files static images we're going to be grabbing them now from the database to make sure we have them basically from the databases what I'm trying to say right we want to have them Dynamic right we don't want to have them static all the time all right okay to make that happen to make that happen we're going to be using Firebase and deep database from the from there right on top of that after we finish with that part two we're going to focus on is go to the detail base when I go to the detail page of course we don't want to see just static content we want to see content that changes based on the mood I click right that's part two part three is going to be login so we're focusing on the login which happens to be right here when I click on this we should be able to log out and I should be able to log in and honestly that is pretty much it for today and once we're done we will go ahead and host our application straight on Firebase and you'll be able to play with it and use it and just be so proud of it to put in your portfolio and so forth all right so our project is here okay to do the whole Firebase getting movies let's do the following let's go ahead and go to home.js okay home.js I will make this a little bit larger home.js on home.gs we need to go ahead and grab the movies that's the functionality we're going to use now to Gap those of course we're going to be grabbing them from the Firebase and right now we have nothing with Firebase related that means we need to install Firebase so create a new terminal right here inside inside your inside your uh what's it called uh your views code and we'll do npm install npm install Firebase done all right we will install that and then we will also add the configuration for the Firebase so let's do npm install install receive install Firebase Dash tools boom voila Firebase Dash tools we got those so those two things NTM install Firebase right here and then npm install Firebase tools both are needed for us to work all right awesome clear this out all right next thing we need to create a firebase.js file because we need the configuration now usually what I would do is I will go ahead and actually show you how to go to Firebase clear your project and so forth but in our case we're not going to do that mainly because a lot of the data all this movie's data there is already prepopularly in our database and so we'll just give you access to be able to prepopulate your data as well right so it just makes it easier for us and for you at the same time let's create a new file here new file we'll do firebase.js and very important make sure this fiber suggests is not is not inside any of these folders like app or components or features or anything like that it needs to be inside the source folder very important next up as you know we down below we have a Google drive folder that has images and it has a few different things below it let me see let me go ahead right here where's that finder folder oh let's go to downloads here and we had a Disney clone challenge this was exactly the what's it called the the folder you can download down below in the description below okay download that and you have videos images and the next thing you have also is something called firebase.js okay I want you to go ahead and actually open this one up so it's going to open this one up either with Sublime Text or whatever that you use to open it up so I'm going to open up inside vs code right here this is the fiber suggest we're going to use all right so copy this one command C go to firebase.js and paste it in there done right and honestly that's all you need and again it's inside the folder Down Below in the description okay inside that folder the firebase.js okay download that and then paste it in say here so what's going on here in this file a few things we are importing Firebase part one nextly we have a Firebase configuration file right there and this basically just gives us access to the actual database next thing we initialize the Firebase app right here right and then what we do is we we need to tell Firebase so what we're going to be using well the first thing we're going to be using is Firebase firestore so firestore is the actual database we're going to be using Firebase authentication later on to be able to log in and log out we're going to be using Google authentication because like I said fibers can have like Yahoo and application there's like all these Amazon application Facebook authentication in our cases it's just gonna be Google auth okay and finally we're going to be using Firebase Storage storage as well right so those three things is well we need to make sure to tell our project uh to use once we get that does everybody have that let me see does everybody this everybody see the folder or see the file everybody has the file on the zoom there yes yes yes yes beautiful awesome all right next thing once we have that let's go back to now home.gs all right Honda GS and here we need to grab the movies from the database and first is a few things we need to use something called use effect to be able to grab those movies let's go and import use effect here use effect bomb right there use effect which is right here now what this is going to be used for is use the fact that says Hey whenever I load my component whenever I upload my page or all that I will be doing is basically just running whatever you tell me to do right so for example here if I say use effect place a use effect boom and I say it like this okay good and I'm going to put nothing inside here check this out if I simply just do comma and I do console log okay console console.log okay hello all right check this out cancel the look hello far save that and if I refresh this all I have to do refresh this inspect dominant on this one called a console see hello so what this is telling me is this right here is being run whenever this component this whole component it gets loaded right this whole thing is being run that's the reason we use users like otherwise if we don't use use effect it will be very messy a lot of calls getting being called if you want to avoid that all right next thing is since we're using Firebase database let's go ahead and import DB DB from Firebase we need to use Firebase like so so dot dot slash means go back up the folder because Chrome inside the components and then we need to go back up to the source folder to access firebase.gs all right that's part one all right since we got that all right let's go ahead and take a look at how do we grab the data so we'll do DB DB dot collection collection DOT book collection of what we have a collection called movies inside our database and we will say something called on Snapshot what does this mean on Snapshot means whenever it's not just kind of like a picture right you take a picture of whatever it is a landscape or you know uh yourself who knows right take a picture and it's a still picture right and it does not move but it's a certain point in time well what a snapshot does it says it's almost like taking a picture of the database and then returning that picture to you right at that point in time that you called it right the point in time that you called it and now what happens also with it is whenever the picture changes or whenever for example the database changes it will actually send a new picture to you every single time that's the cool thing about Firebase is that's why it's called a live database all right on Snapshot all right and we'll do like this snapshot called a function okay so it's gonna get a snapshot and then I will show it to you what we get from it snapshot oops let me go and times quickly snapshot snapshot snapshot okay good good good good good and well let's go ahead and install log what we actually get you'll see it's a little messy check this out snap shot okay done okay if I go ahead and right click this inspect that one on this one console log what do I get look at this this is what I get right here like I said it's really messy but what do we have here here we have Docs we have empty metadata query and then size right and the main thing we need to look into is docs you see look at this you see this right here it says array of 16 what do you think this means well this just means literally we have 16 items in our database right here look right 16 movies but again you don't see them fully it's a little bit odd the way it's made but you'll see that in a second here but we have this 16 elements in the database and we just received them right once we receive them well what's going to happen is let's go let's go ahead and capture them we'll do let temp movies here 10 movies is equal to snapshot snapshot dot docs remember how we talked about the docs portion map and that map will simply Loop through every single snapshot and then we're going to return something from it check this out right here's a little return so for every single dock every single dock that we have and put it on the right hand side for every single dock that we that we are going to use we're going to grab the ID and the data from it so return boom ID doc Dot ID comma dot dot dot data hold the phone as I understand what you're talking about this is very confusing what are we doing here let me show it to you console.log .data all right so the log and check this one out okay inspect on it boom inspect the element on this go to console again look at this you see every single doc that data is is what is the object look at this right here boom you've got the background image the card image description subtitle title these are all movie stored in our database right and that's exactly what we are doing here and so we're capturing that by using doctor data we're capturing that portion but also separately in order to capture the unique ID so we can later on use it for the detail page or capture inside doc.id as well right and this dot dot send simply means basically let's go ahead and unpack this object and put this whole dog the object inside this new object that we created which is simply just an object with the brackets right and then we'll return that back to the 10 movies so we're doing this right here let's go ahead and stop the so lock here I will do consult a log cancel the log temp movies okay save that all right boom right there look 10 movies is exactly what we now need we have the ID the ID of the actual movie the ID is used for identification inside the database we have a description the card image the background image pretty much everything we need for the detail page and also for this page as well and honestly that is it that is it my friends right but of course we're not done right we have these movies and that's great right how we go have it and show them now I'm here how do we do that well this is now where Redux comes in and this is the interesting portion okay and I want you to pay attention to this really quickly here a Redix is basically what's going to manage all the data so if you imagine this right if you imagine the fact that if you have a rectangle here and if you imagine that this right here is state I'm going to make this of course this for here State okay this is called State and state is basically a database DB for your app but internal app basically for your it's basically DB for database inside Chrome right and inside State we have what we have things like we have different um values maybe we have movies inside the state oop not here uh maybe we have movies maybe we have you know user maybe we have uh I don't know some kind of other list maybe right um all of that is actually being saved so for example here I'm gonna say movies movies maybe for example we have user right the application State sees all that and so and manages all that right and because we save it in the global state in the application State we can access the average weight that we need that is the important part here this is why Redux is so useful because otherwise if we don't do that then we have to pass down data from movies down to movies here and you're passing down data every single time and that's a lot right that is not very good that's not very useful and that's why relax is so important okay now at this point since we do have Redux let's go ahead and take a look at what do we create with it well if you look at Firebase and I'm sorry if you look at Redux readers has a few things when we did the Redux toolkit when we use the template Redux template right here you see it created a temporary one called counter boom let me go remove some force me Kana right here and if I click into it it has something called counter slice and we have the initial State here and so forth we're going to mock this up and I want to show you exactly how it works let's create a new file here a new folder actually we'll call it movie okay movie oh actually not inside here but inside the features so new photos inside the features not bad we'll call it movie boom not inside the counter remove this one delete this one I don't want that boom okay counter movie Inside here create new file called movie slice and I know you might be wondering what is movies like so why is why is it called the slice I'll explain a little bit why all right and inside movie slice uh a few things we need to do is we need to import create slice create slice slice there we go from Redux toolkit so from at Redux Redux right JS slash tool kit done all right so crease live for midax Slash 2 Kit and honestly that's it and so usually we have a three Ducks is a few things we always start out with initial State like when I say state is what do we have at first what do we have in our data in in our Chrome database or in our application database well we always start out with nothing so we say const initial state initial state is equal to bump initial state is equal to and we're going to give a movies key it's not right it's nothing right we start off with nothing initially okay once we have that we're actually going to create the slides for the movie so what does this mean so let's go let me take a look at this const movie slice will we slice is equal to create slice and you're like holy this is so much I don't get it it's as complicated as hell all right don't worry don't worry I'll explain this let's create let's name this slice here I'm going to name this slice called movie so name I'm going to name a movie boom comma and I'm going to pass the initial State that's going to be loaded with initial State boom comma and I'm going to give the a reducer now what is a reducer check this out okay um well very simple Redux is made of a few things actions actions reducers users and State right actions reducers and state there's also something called sagas but we don't really care about that too much here that was previous Redux okay actually this real estate and action is basically the action you want to do so for example right if you want to I don't know create a movie if you want to set the new movie if you want to delete a movie if you want to log a user out if you want to log a user in this is called the action this is called actions okay you want to log them in you want to log them out you want to sign them in you want to save the data it's called actions right now reducers reducers are basically is what takes an action and actually changes the state so it kind of kind of goes kind of like goes like this let me show you actions foreign call reducers reducers change the state and so forth that's honestly what happens right and now it does not make it's nothing more complicated than that right one way I can show it to you is really cool like this on the right hand side you can see here that this right here is an action it's called dispatch so we usually dispatch in action it's like you you're dispatching your driver right right you dispatch an action it goes to the action right here there's a type deposit it goes to the store the reducer the reducer right here changes the state to ten dollars see so again we click on something dispatch is in action oh let me go ahead right this budget is an action boom boom reduce or change the data the state now ten dollars that's obviously this is the whole thing dispatch right reducer changes the data in the state and that is pretty much it and we change it in the UI and that's it the coolest part about this is because whenever I change the state here right basically the whole app knows about it the whole app right so let's say for example I have a home page that has some data I have a home page that has some data right and the reducer said hey the movie's changed right so we uploaded new movies or whatever it might be what will happen is every single component will get notified about that and so now you can make the changes really fast and really quickly and you don't have to listen on everything and that's what makes it so powerful okay all right continuing on so does that make sense is this a better description of kind of what we like says this is a relationship does that make sense raise your hand is that a little bit better to understand yeah a lot better okay good good I know it's a little bit hard it's this one is usually a little hard to understand but all you have to know is we have actions that to basically what you want to do so kind of what you want to do let's say I want to walk I want to walk so I'm walking walking walking and then maybe I want to for example buy something or I want to buy something then the reducer is what allows me to do that okay all right so we have initial State let's create those reducers boom let's create those reducers all right all right we're going to create a reducer called set movies and what this will do is we'll take a parameter called state so this is the current state comma action right common action and this is a function right here pretty much right and what's going to happen is this is where we change the state so in the sample is function we're going to pass in new movies that we get from the database it's as simple as that so to stay the movies is equal to action dot payload actually that payload all it is is that's the actual parameter that we pass into the summaries function you'll see that later on that's what pill pillow carries so if I pass in an array into some movies I will get it here it's an action.payload that's what will happen next up in order to actually use the movie slides we have to export the actions because remember we dispatch actions right so I'm going to say export const right here const and I'm going to say here said movies right is equal to movie slice movie slice dot actions boom there right so this is the ash that we're going to export next thing is we need to now export the actual movie State itself because remember how do we use a component to access our movie State work very simply we have to export it so export and the gist of it is we usually like to say something like for example select movies right that's kind of like the the the traditional tradition but that's the way you want to do it select something so what are you selecting from the state is it movies maybe there was something else say for example like I don't know uh horror movies right movies in here right well you would do a select horror movies inside here whatever it might be right that's it okay so select movies is equal to here we'll take the state and we'll say it's state and all it is is state oh state DOT what state well the movie state right movie status is the reducer right state of movie dot movies done okay this will give us back the movies okay next okay we're going to export the actual slice itself so export the actual reducer export default so by default we're going to export the reducer movie slice dot reducer right the reason why we do that is because we need to tell the store we call the store the whole store that we have this right here reducer save that awesome sweet let's now go back to our app go to storage yes and we need to now import that store actually right we need to import that store or input that reducer and we can do that very simply just by simply going okay let's do it like this so import whilst a movie reducer right movie reducer from voyages are from features features Dash movie Dash movie slice okay and then inside of these counters because which came originally we just say movie is equal to the movie reducer and all you're telling the application is that we have this reducer at our disposal that's it that is all you are saying my friends all right that's great let's actually see if this works I'm going to save this I'm Gonna Save this refresh it all right so nothing's broken so far which is good nothing's broken so far the main thing is going to happen is when we actually use the movie reducer which we will do inside the home.js basically whenever we are right whenever we are getting movies this is we will be able to set the movies for the whole state the whole state because then it can be accessed everywhere inside our application right so inside our home page let's say we have a home page here right that's the home page the home page and now we have for example the movies component right two different components we have components movies component and a home component so let me say here this is for example the home component this is the movies component Right Moves component well they both share they both share the same store right which contains movies right so what happens is that inside the home functionality okay inside the home functionality all I do is I hey I set new movies right using this the reducer and then because of that I can actually get movies inside the moves component that's it that's all that happens all right boom awesome all right so let's go ahead and do that now to use the reducer we need to use something called dispatch so let's go ahead and do this we'll say import right and we'll say use dispatch right there use dispatch okay from Redux react Dash Redux all right and then we will import the set movies action so import right there set movies okay from what is it dot features Dash what movie Dash what movie slice right but there was a movie Dash movie slides right there beautiful okay we got the action which is set movies we've got the use dispatch which we're going to use to dispatch that action so this place like basically calling it it's like hey do this action that's what this patch is used for all right and then honestly that is pretty pretty much it uh we've got this badge we've got that right to use this patch we need to say that we say const dispatch is equal to use dispatch oop not that one this patch it's better good good we got that now so let's think about this right once I get my movies inside you know in from the database what I need to do well it's very simple at this point now I need to that's this that that aspect A dispatch in action right called set movies to set the movies for the whole store for the whole database that's what we need to do does that make sense anybody question does that make sense yes yes yes which is dispatch in action saying hey you know what let's we got these moves from the database let's go ahead and then store them inside the whole state the global State okay this is where we'll do like this we'll say dispatch dispatch right dispatch and we'll say set movies right and this will have temp movies inside here Tempo movies you get 10 movies okay and let's go and check out make sure nothing's broken let me see not does anything break let's rock the inspect element anything break oop I forgot to share here so here's what we did we did this batch we did dispatch right here okay and then we did dispatch submoo is right here okay that's we just did and we imported sub moves and use dispatch beautiful all right all right so if we go to console here no bad ears just good this is a good sign nothing's nothing's going haywire which is a good sign right but of course we still don't know how is this working well that's actually now use the Redux in terms of actual uses the state that we can use the same state between the movies component and the home component well go to movies okay go to movies and let's use select movies so when I say import select movies that will get us the movies that we stored in the database select movies from from what well dot features slash slash what movie slash movie slice right movie slice again where's this coming from I mean go to movie slides here movie slice boom look at this see select movies select movies all all that's doing is that's cool getting us the movie State that's it that's all it is doing that's pretty much it right let's do here that's all that it's doing so let's now go back to uh where was I at hours at Movies component boom all right that's good next up is we need to actually to use the selector we need to use a use selector so import I know it's a little complicated guys there's so much to it right but once you know it for the first time or want to kind of realize how it works it's not that bad oh come on you selector from again react Dash Redux beautiful okay the three Ducks save that there we go you selector and let's now grab those movies okay we'll say constant movies this is where we're going together with so constant movies is equal to use selector the one we just imported from here react Redux okay and the selector will be select movies that's on that's the one we need to use select movies okay and let's check this out I'm going to consult a log here to the log right there right there I'm saying this is movies right comma I'm gonna say move just so you guys can see it okay oh no no no no not that boom all right save that inspect element console oh look at that this is movies at Ray 16. we have the moves you see how it traveled between the global State we have the global state right so what do we do here we went down to the home state home component right inside the home component we grabbed here so the home component we grabbed the data right here okay we grab the the data from the database we dispatched an action we used Redux to save the movies inside basically the store right the react store right it's kind of like a store where you buy things right you can buy things you can put things in there you can buy things from there right we put the movies to the store right once we put that there if we now go back to movies component right we just now grab from the store we grab it from that store that is it that's happening here what do you guys think about does that make sense does that make sense kind of iffy yes or no raise your hand if it kind of makes sense right yes yes okay good I know I know it's a little bit iffy to fully understand videos it takes a few days it takes a few I mean sometimes it takes a week to fully understand it okay but we have the movies which is great all right we have those once we get those of course we need to replace these static images now right now how do we do that well that's pretty simple we can do that by doing a wrap a basically a loop through them so we'll do the following we'll do let's see this so we'll do movies so we'll check if the movies exist right and then if the moves exist we'll say like this movies and or say this movies.map check this out movies the map okay and this will take in a movie okay oh I should not not like that taking a movie and it will actually no come on now there we go thank you all right and the wrap is actually the rap which is currently directly the rap is what the rap is this right that's the whole thing right so doing it here we'll put it inside here boom boom boom boom okay all right there you go okay all right so what's going on here this functionality says hey if movies exist then you can go ahead and proceed with doing something about it right but if movies is null because in the beginning with the when the page loads the movies is no right we haven't gotten it from the database yet once we did get it from the database we simply just Loop through it right here that's it that's it all right and as we Loop through it we use a map function to Loop through it get the movie and let's now actually get the movie data right so we'll say the following the source image remember how we can still log The Source image let's go ahead and remove this portion don't need this that it will be what movie Dot what card image okay let me go ahead and just oh do you see what just happened right here guys look at that look at that just like that it just worked do I see right we love the most can you hear me Jesse that's amazing yeah I can hear you beautiful beautiful right so it's just all working the way you should be let me make sure that I want to give it to you there we go awesome you hear me Jesse okay good you can hear me yeah I can hear you yeah yeah and what did we just do here like I said we grabbed the move from here and I'm going to consult the log saw the log movies okay likely is an aspect element right this camera oh no console something happened each child okay we'll take care of this a second but here are the movies right we have the ID we have the subtitle right and what we use from the movie is we use the movie the car damage right so if you look at it here the card image so that's what we used that's what we said card image right here card image you see that's exactly what we need to use right there all right and honestly that's that's pretty much it all right but of course we're not done yet so a few things I want to fix together here it says here you see how there's an error that says here well each child each child in a list should have a unique key prop what does that mean well Redux underneath the hood tracks all of these components all these components right if there's any changes that happen to them but attracts them through a key like a unique key and to give unique key we need to do something like this so we'll say key is equal to and we need to give a unique key and what's the most unique thing that we have about a movie what is it put in the chat what is the most unique thing that we have about a movie individual movie Object it's the ID that's correct so I will say to get the ID well actually we'll grab the index here I mean I don't think you could move that ID so we'll say movie here movie dot ID that's it so save that boom let's see inspect element and let's take a look if that era appears still MC console okay that's the old ear so if I refresh this oh yeah no air you see no more errors now it's all working perfect the way it should all right so we have done that portion we've grabbed the movies from the database they're in our possession we have it all right only thing is left at this point is when I click on them I should be able to go to a detailed page so I can see the eventual movie uh object basically that's the whole goal about this right right there and of course let's go ahead and remove all all these uh Simpsons once because it just looks like our Disney clone is full of Simpsons which is not the case so let's go and do this so wrap let's remove all these Simpsons don't need that bye bye that's funny all right save that oh just happened I just removed all notes right here there you go all right save that okay good good no more symptoms thank God I mean nothing against sepsis I love Simpsons guys okay nothing against Simpsons guys all right next up uh what do we have is let's go ahead and add our code here so add uh add grab movies from DB we'll put that into our GitHub save beautiful all right all right number two that we're going to work on is let's look on the detail page so we need to create a link here when I click on this specific thing I should be able to go to the detail page of the specific image of what I clicked on so the specific right movie uh won't be that hard we will use react router down for that as well and the way we do it is something called a link this also will say a link here so import import link we've used reactor zombie previously but now we're going to use the link portion of it link right here okay from what react Dash router router Dash Dom that's dumb okay and really what a link is basically it surrounds the object with an attack honestly that that's all it does we can do that here so I will say inside the wrap I will say let's link it will do the link like so boom put the image inside the link of course okay save that put it like this okay and link to What specifically this is what we need to specify we'll link it to what well how do you think we're going to link it well we have the detail page let me go to the app.js right inside your detail page but what if we passed in a detailed slash ID a lot of times we will do detail slash and we'll do give an ID like this oh come on Rocket I don't need you right now right slash ID and this ready is going to be the parameter we pass in into our detail component all right let's go back to movie uh yes movies okay and we'll say Link and Link to link to and we'll give it the link so here's the link right so let's think about this right we'll say it's detail so slash detail right right detail slash what the ID of the movie so right here we're going to use template literals then movie dot ID boom right there so all it will tell us is it will link us to the detail and then division movie ID right so we're going to Loop to every single movie I get the ID from the movie and then put it inside the link towards the detail page and honest honestly that's that's it that's it we're done with that portion it's as simple as that let's go and right click this I want to show it to you guys right click on it inspect element look at this you see this Ace draft tag right here look at this see this no this one here right there detail page and this 30ay is in the visual linked to the movie If I go to a different movie the link will be different because of course the ID is different right so this is 530 aui this is 5n and honestly that's pretty much it that's all we got to do that's it comprehendo that's it right so if I go back to here we have our link right there beautiful okay say that Tata okay save that all right we have that all right so now if we click on it should technically take as a detail page okay are you ready for this are you ready are you ready so click on it oh let's go look at that it took us direct the detail page but of course it's not the correct image still right so like it's not the correct one so it's just the same one but the reason why that's the case is because if we now go to the detail page what right of course it's all static content right but look at this it's starting to come together really nicely is you click on individual movie right there it takes you to the page that you want us to take it to and honestly that's it that's all we need to know specifically look at that that's so good guys what do you guys think so far give me a thumbs up in the comments below if you guys are liking what you just seems so far give a thumbs up there we go beautiful beautiful beautiful all right all right now let's focus on the detail page right here okay um a few things since we're passing the ID you see how here we have the ID that's the ID okay we need to capture that idea because we need to get grab all the data about the specific movie so here's what we'll do I'm going to say like this okay Papa we're going to use use parameters from reactor Dom so import oh import you use params use programs from all right from what react Dash router Dash Dom save it all right next one const and we'll grab the ID this is the smart thing about react Rotterdam and knows this kind of stuff because we in the inside the app that GSB told it that the what's going to happen after the detail link is the ID it will save it actually in the parameter that's the cool part let's go back to the detail and we'll say use params use params right there and we'll grab the ID from it so now if I go go ahead and do console.log console.log ID so technically that's it technically ID let's go ahead and expect them on this one okay expect them on this one let's go ahead and go to console all right prop type the prop 2 is marked as required in Lincoln but its value is undefined no that's different okay there's the idea right here that's all we got to do see we got we grabbed the ID that's it all right save it beautiful okay next up we need to again grab the data for this specific movie right and we're going to use use effect so let's go ahead and code to react or say use effect here use effect okay again so let's do use effect because we need to grab the data individual data right right there and this needs to happen whenever we load the component the component the detail component specifically okay this empty bracket means call this functionality whenever you load the component I just want you to make sure you understand that next thing inside here we need to grab grab the movies the movie movie info from DB from the DB from database right there to do that let's import DB from Firebase import B from okay Firebase okay and to grab the data bit the movies database we'll say DB dot collection collection okay and with the collection we use it's called movies right that's coming from database directly okay beautiful we'll give it a specific dock we need to use so dot doc Doc and the ID that's it DOC ID right this is directly going to convert it from here right it's kind of like telling you hey grabbing the movie with this specific ID dog yet right there dot then so once we get it we're going to grab it and then we're going to use it now right the dog is going to be inside the functionality here and what we need to do is we need to check if this dock exists so we'll say if doc doc dot exists meaning if found the specific document or the specific yeah the specific entry with that ID we're going to use it now so if that exists we'll say what well we need to save the movie data save the movie data but how guys do you think we should see this inside do you think we should save inside the Redux or do you think we should save it actually inside the state what do you guys think Redux or state if you think it's going to be Redux raise your hand here okay everything is if you think it's going to be State raise your hand now what do you think or give me a thumbs up it's actually going to be in state here's why because this changes for every single right page this changes right we're not going to reuse the movie data anywhere else besides on this page so we don't need to save inside no the actual Redux instead we're going to use State okay to use that we need to you to use state you state right there okay we're going to grab it so we'll say uh what is that what are we going to do uh do const right there cast movie movie sub movie that's how we go ahead and I will say equal use state okay so you stay is basically like Redux but for individual components okay for individual small components if Redux is for the whole app okay and it's shared amongst all the components your state is basically for individual component so it's on a smaller scale okay and it was made for three different reasons it just makes things easier sometimes okay and what we get here this is the movie that we will use and if we want to change the movie we use sub movie so in our case since we get the movie we'll do set movie right I will do dog dot data that's it save that all right okay and otherwise however if it does not exist for example let's just say that I don't know the movie does not exist we're going to basically redirect direct to home page for some reason let's just say it does not work out right well in our case let's go and check out what we do so I will say here consult the log console.log movie is movie is what movie right here okay save that all right check this out inspect them on this one let's go and do console oh movie is object right there look at that boom right there so this ID right this idea give us a specific object we need right there this is the object we need holy moly that's so cool right pick up grab that oh oh that's not one okay I know what happened there so that's it once we have the movie right because again we use set movie to save us at the movie Object right here once we have that we now we need to use the that date the specific data right and now it's very simple inside here instead of doing a static image we replace that with a normal image so image source was a movie dot open now like this okay movie that's what background image but background image oh yes save it oh look at that this is the exact movie that we clicked on guys the exact move we clicked on is that background image right next one image title will do movie right there right right or say what movie Dot title image save that boom look at that guys now it's Tangled you see how it's doing all right next up we need to change now this specific portion right this specific portion so what is what is this going to be movie dot what that subtitle grab it movie dot subtitle boom right there okay oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait and then a spell right sub title which is going to be this one right here subtitle okay boom right there look fantasy animation and finally last I'm gonna be moved the description so we'll say here movie right there movie The What description done that is it guys that's it our detail page is now premium is finished that's it look at and look at how beautiful it looks you see the steps we took we grabbed the ID once we got the ID we grab from the database right like I said let me see look at a mistake let's think about this here two we got so here so here grab ID grab ID right then grab from DB right and populate populate populate data or populate UI that's it that's all we did we grabbed the ID from the top page we grab for you we use that to grab uh the data from database and then we populated you the UI that's all we did inside here honestly that's it beautiful that is all good guys are you still with me guys how cool is this you guys still with me that's pretty awesome huh you know who with me yes yes yes yes yes yes yes beautiful beautiful beautiful all right next one let's go take a look at how this actually works let's go back to our home page let's go back to our homepage I actually want to link the homepage to actually go back home because I'm getting tired of typing home I'll do Incredibles oh can I have the background image of undefined let me go back to here let's try this here again oh interesting let's go to here I think I know this is happening actually I know what's going on oh okay I got it so here's what needs to happen here um in order to for this to fully fully work right again this use effect happens maybe a little bit later on of course right so basically it initially we don't actually have this data at first right this happens later on this is why we need to do a little bit a little bit differently and in the detail page foreign image so here's a lot of times what I'll do for example the reason why it's yelling me is because the fact that we don't have the movie our disposal right now right we're trying to grip the movie back on image but whenever we go grab it from the database we're not actually getting it we're getting it a few seconds later that's kind of the issue there right so let me go ahead and look at this here for a second right there so we're still grabbing these that's no problem right I think the problem comes when we go ahead and go the specific movie so let me go and click this again that's okay all right to fix that here's what I usually do which is very simple fix I just do like this I say if movie exists like this if movie then we say uh uh no no and end right there right there eighth movie exists only then do we get all this data look at this oh come on come on holy Molina's holy macaroni okay my next only the movie exists do we actually show it in the database or show it on the front right there oh do you like this Papa don't worry don't worry guys it's gonna be fixed okay save that oh come on give me a break okay save that um must be wrapped in in closing tag you want to do this I did want a GSX fragment yes I did but oh I think I know why okay here let's do it like this and then this will be the closing tag right here we go fixed there you go and I'll show you exactly why this happened and what's going on and why we need to do this check this out okay good save that okay let's look at one oh look at that boom right there look at that boom boom boom oh let's go let's go let's go we fixed it guys we fixed this issue look at that that's awesome oh boom let's see we fixed the issue so what happened here guys very simple right well initially we got this errors because we tried to grab the background image for a movie that does not exist it's as simple as that right um does not exist because use effect it takes us a few seconds to actually grab the data from a database right so it takes a few seconds maybe like five seconds but to go to the actual page it takes a little millisecond right and so when we actually are executing this while this is trying to get the data right here right this is already being preloaded and is trying to do move the background image which is not right because we don't have it yet unfortunately we don't have it so we're not going to do this will give us an error but what we did here is very simple we said if the movie Object exists basically if it's this way he is not null right if the movie Object exists right then we will go ahead and execute and actually all put all this to your jsx in place right and then we got all these errors because why because we need to put this into this is called like an um an empty like tag an empty tag I forgot what it's called Anonymous tag Anonymous tag so it's not actually a deal but it's kind of like a div right when you put it inside here you have to wrap it inside of one container and anything else can go inside it it's a little bit confusing on on the react side but it's just some things like that they have to get used to unfortunately with react so uh yeah I know unfortunately that's just how the case it is you know but with it look we said the movies we say the data we got it if I go back to the home page boom right there oh oh so good oh oh so good look at that boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom done guys how cool is this you guys still with me yes or no let's go yes you guys you are beautiful as always love you all very much now was that was that understandable did you guys understand why we had all these issues do you guys get that yes yes or no give me a thumbs up for yes give me a thumbs up for no okay all right in the comments as well guys on YouTube as well too all right all right so we got that portion that's working now all fine no problem whatsoever let's now focus on the last part of our application which is going to be the login section this might be a little bit harder but I'm sure we'll be able to figure it out okay this is where now we have to use Redux yet again okay we need to create a user kind of State Management to be able to manage the user State and see if the user exists right if these exist we do this if it does not exist we do that right that's it okay let's go ahead and create a movie slice uh let's go ahead and create a user slice actually so a new folder inside features new folder let's call call it user done right inside here we'll go ahead and do my bad we'll do user slice so new file new file user slice.js done okay same thing here let's go ahead and import Redux just how we did it inside the movie slice and by the way just a quick note the reason why it's called a slice is it's kind of like a slice of a pizza right if we're creating all these reducer functionalities which are just slices of the big thing that's why it's called a slice yeah nothing complicated there mmhmm and pour slice nice then create initial state so const initial state initial state all right and there are three things we're going to say first one is going to be named right okay and this is going to be empty and then we're going to save email right also nothing and then we're going to say photo right that's the photo of the person foreign once we got that let's go ahead and create a slice so we'll say const user slice slice is equal to create slice create slicer create slice okay all right inside the crate slice give it some values like name in our case it can be user cool and then we will go ahead and give it the initial state right so our initial state is basically nothing nada then we have reducers this is where we will get our reducers and a few things we need to do on here inside the reducers um few juices the first we need to create is called set user so site user login so we'll call it set user login and this will of course take state comma what action right Papa there we go the second one is going to be which one which is going to be set sign out so set sign out because again when we sign out we want to be able to clear the state correct so we want to be able to clear everything here so it says sign out right there we'll say state okay no actually we're going to pass into here because nothing really happens and when we set to now what happens what do you think in the comments below what happens when we set sign out it's very simple we say state dot name is equal to basically nothing again or no okay we say state dot email is equal to null as well oh no boom and then we say State a photo that what photo is equal to what null 2 right beautiful now when we log in of course let's go and finish this one up again state.name is equal to what we're going to pass a some kind of action we'll say action dot payload payload dot name right there all right and then same thing is gonna happen with these other ones are here so there bomb in this case email and it will say payload.email right and then State DOT photo payload.photo all right no that's not the one save that beautiful okay so few things again set user login to be able to log the user in we save the user data okay then we set user sign out so we should be able to sign the user out so that we don't have the data anymore and basically we can't show that application anymore that's it all right give me one second I need to go ahead and take a breath so good so good okay okay after we've done that we need to grab all the actions right so we'll say here what I'll do it like this so it's a little bit cleaner okay so again we need to export the actions because actions will allow us to dispatch them right so we'll do what set user login and then set sign out so here we'll say right there oh no that's not what I want come on nope said user login comma set sign out is equal to what is equal to user slice user slice dot What DOT actions actions right there beautiful actions not action what actions are there actions make sure measure is plural all right after that okay we will go ahead and bring back the specific data so we'll say export right const and then this will be select select it's like what select user username user um also user name is equal to what State uh Papa state the user.wat.name right same thing is going to happen with these other ones but in our case we're going to do select user what user what do you think guys here user email here right because we need to select the email and we're going to grab the email from here boom and select user watch to a photo right there and that's going to grab the user photo done all right and then at this point all we need to do is export the reducer so we'll say export export uh default so by default we export the reducer default default user slice dot reducer Danza okay all right and that's it we've created our react Redux slice for just the user okay now let's tell the story that we have them so let's go to the store.js let's import it let's go ahead and remove this counter reduce because it's not useful at all oh there we go move this kind of reducer on unnecessary fully and let's do import user reducer from okay the features Dash what user dashboard user slice done okay and the same thing is going to happen here so say comma and then we'll give it a comma we'll say user here user user slice done all right so we were able to pass in all that data and now if we look at it here really no big area that's going on here we're pretty much all good on that aspect that's not what I want a view sort of you inspect element let's see yeah nothing crazy in terms of like actual errors are going on here nope we're good beautiful that makes me so happy okay of course if I go to here it should be all good as well okay so sweet sweet so so now in order to fully make this word we need to go let's think about how this works right we need to create a login button if we're not logged in right so let's think about this this will happen inside the header because remember if I go back to our app which is this app right here right let's go sign out you see the header changes right we have a login button right here right this right here and we need to be able to handle that so let's create the login button boom let's create the login button and that's going to happen inside the header header.js boom right there okay all right let's see so what's going to happen we need to be able to grab the username the email photo and see if it exists if the user does not exist we show the login button however if it does exist we don't show the login button and instead we show the user Circle does that make sense comprende oh good yes yes yes yes yes comprending good all right all right let's make that happen in that case by the way let me see here all right beautiful wow so many comments are going holy moly you guys insane all right beautiful all right so log in let's go ahead and create the login button in that case but first we need to of course need to import the select username all this kind of stuff so we can do that by doing like this import right here import select select user name comma select so that user what user photo comma what select ah user photo do anything else username and user photo we don't need their email that's pretty much it okay okay from what from no that's not what I want from from the actual user slide so from the features features comma or slash user slash user slice okay save that next thing of course we need to go ahead and import the the whole use selector thing so let's go ahead and do import watch use selector oh that's not what I want no use selector from what from oh my I forgot to show you guys my bad my bad my bad on YouTube how long was I on here I'm very curious hmm well here's what we did guys I said I went to here uh all I did is I imported this right here so like username is like user select user photo okay that's all pretty much did on YouTube Just so you guys know okay and then on the user slice I mean we did this whole user slide so hopefully you guys seen this I don't remember when did I put it on here hopefully you guys seen that one that's the one we did create okay let's now go back to I don't think it was that long huh I don't think it was that long it was not no okay thank you just to use selector okay let's go back to Heritage yes from and we need to import that from react Redux Yak Dash Redux three ducks react Dash Redux and honestly that's pretty much it redis Redux we've imported that that's all we now need at this point okay let me see make sure it's all good here react with us you selector import that uh let's actually now use that right so we use selector let's go ahead and use that so we're going to grab the username so const user name is equal to use selector you selector and which one you're going to use well select username right here so select select user name right there beautiful and then something const user photo is equal to use selector no um yeah so maybe on line eight yeah thank you Jesse you a selector awesome okay what do you select user photo beautiful so I'll use your photo it's exactly what we need and now at this point a few things are going to happen so here's let's think about this if we don't have if we don't have basically like the you know the yeah if we don't have the user basically then we you know login button and we can do that inside the nav menu so after the logo let's think about like this I'm going to create an if else statement so basically if there is no username user name oh this one if there is no username right if it does not exist then we will go ahead and show the login button so I'm going to say login that's it right log in right here and I'm gonna say login right this could be that's going to be a stock upon that we'll create otherwise otherwise otherwise we'll show the nav menu oh this one and the user image actually I feel like those two things are important okay otherwise we'll show the user menu and the login so to make that happen we need to make it again we need to use this call Anonymous tag like this right boom right so we need to put in the user image right there and then the menu inside there Papa Papa so we had another menu in here user image in here of course right uh to make it fully work of course we can do that so we have to do like this we have to do parentheses close parentheses right there Then over by the Seas oh hold on that's not right it's not right question mark so again if this is true we do this otherwise we do this whole thing understand that's all happens that's it okay so now let's go ahead and try this out I'm Gonna Save this let's go to our app it says login is not defined exactly perfect it's exactly what we need to do so let's go to our login button so we'll say const login is equal to basically a const uh login is equal to style dash dash we'll make it a uh I want to say it let's just say a deal for now okay I do okay I did this option button right there you see Perfect all right all right so at this point to make this fully work what we'll do is the following so let's go ahead and do that um login button will do we'll give it a border radius let's think about this where's our login button oh it has like a border so let's give it a border initially so we have border one pixel solid let's level like this 41 pixel solid good let's think about this put it here border one pixel solid beautiful all right and then within that we're going to uh let's see border then it's going to give us some padding so padding 8 pixels right 16 pixels so 16 pixels on the left and right hand side save that beautiful now it's a little bit bigger bigger button which exactly what I like all right right so we stretch it out let's give it a border radius now border Dash radius radius right here okay radius beautiful I that's going to be border radius of 4 pixels four pixels I like that uh so much better all right we're going to go ahead and let's go ahead and do letter spaces so maybe face the ladder spacing a little bit spacing right 1.5 pixels okay just make it a little bit bigger and let's do tax transform uppercase to make sure it's all applicated text transform transform right here right there uppercase bro good all right beautiful nice nice nice nice then we just need to give it a background color so let's give it a background color a little bit more of a darker side but a transparent background color so let's try that right here voila okay so it's a little dark darker background color okay awesome next thing on the hover of this button of this div right so let's do the hover so we'll say hover right here so now however what are we going to do well let's think about this right on the hover we're changing kind of like number one to White so we're kind of flipping the black to white white to black right so let's try that right now okay hover let's change the background color background color it's going to be more of a wider color so it's going to a little bit like this awesome and then the color of the actual text is going to be now black so let's see black okay all right and then border color is gonna be transparent as well so border color Porter Dash color it'll be transparent parent uh rent be transparent there we go so let's go hover go ahead and hover this oh let's go beautiful but we're not done yet because let's give it a small transition so we'll do a transition here transition all 0.2 seconds right here no oh let's go beautiful let's also get a cursor pointer cursor pointer nice ah oh look at that beautiful that's what I'm talking about now of course so we have to log in now how do we make sure that this login is kind of all the way on the left slash the right hand side that's actually a good question how do we make sure we do that how do we make sure that the login is all the way on the lot on the left and the right hand side what do you guys think because if you think about this right the login is here right I hit the logo here right is there anything we can do for example with I don't know uh with the nav what should we do what do you guys think we can do well here's my thoughts on this I think we should create a logging container here a container here login container right here like this here's why I can put the lock inside here no problem whatsoever right but the login container look look what I'll do is I will go ahead and actually basically give it a flex of one that's a cool part I as well do all right that's going to create a long container underneath this one so we'll say Okay const login container style.div okay check out this Flex one Flex one right no look I know I know I know don't worry don't worry about this so here's what we'll do right it stretched out the whole div that's okay so here's what we'll do Now display Flex okay you see and then we'll do what justify content check this out justify content Center or flux sent justify justify content what flex and boom right there you see login now shifts right to the right hand side which is exactly what we need which is right here right there see just just I'm too good I'm too good so there we go we got we got that portion right there sorry that's how fun you know I was proud of that that's pretty cool I did not fly you know so okay so the login button is right there okay now what needs to happen is we need to go ahead on the click of this button we need to log ourselves in right now how does that work out well this is gets a little bit more tough for guys all right so let's try let's try this let's go ahead and create a signin function so we'll do const sign in sign in right here is equal to a function right and this is where Firebase really it plays a big role here okay on the sign in function uh well we need to input off here so let's go ahead and do that so this is where really we're going to use a lot of you know what is this react find render compatibility type I don't need that right here all right so let's go and import import we're going to use auth so import auth comma provider Provider from Firebase right from what Firebase right there boom okay okay import that from the from Firebase okay now when we sign in the way it works is very simple I click on something and I will call a function that will sign me in basically so to make that happen I will say here auth DOT sign in with popup sign in uh I'll do cleanly sign in with no with well this is what right there it's only with popup and the popup so basically it's going to pop up something what provider right well we said in Firebase we're going to use the Google provider so we'll say provider here provider beautiful and then that then so when we sign ourselves in and it's successful we say we get the result and what result do we get well let's take a look at what we get here back okay we get results and we actually let's go into console log the result for now console.log the log result okay boom save that console log result and of course we need to make that happen when you do unclick on here so on click unclick is equal to what and will give the function the sign in function so sign in sign in sign I function okay so let's try that now so we have that portion done let's click login oh oh would you look at that how cool is that oh guys holy moly right you click login pops up a button click contact level programmer right and let's see what we get back inspect them on this one what do we get back here let's go to console uh blah we get an object actually here look at this and this object has a user object let me show you so you guys can see it better right there we have a user object right here right there see and the user object has a lot of stuff including some IDs but the coolest thing it has is right here display name email and there's a photo one here too photo URL you see so we can actually use that fully we can fully use that to grab that data let's try it okay let's try it okay let's go back to here okay let's go back to here all right we have the specific portion all right so now let's go ahead and actually set the user data so we'll do of course console.log.user so the log uh user but a few things we need to do because on the log no user is fine this is where you set the data in the Redux to set the data in the Redux to set all this username and folder and stuff like that of course we need to grab this from the user slice right here right because we need to grab the what the set user login so let's grab that right now set user login let's go and grab that go back to overhead.js let's grab that from the user slice boom right there okay okay and then let's go ahead and you need to dispatch it as well so let's go ahead and dispatch it too so that means we need to import this patch that means we need to import use right here use dispatch use dispatch comma with use selector as well and we do use the dispatch so const dispatch is equal to what use dispatch use dispatch okay use this patch and then after that once we've once we imported dispatch let's actually dispatch it so here we'll do dispatch right there right dispatch what well what we dispatched the set user login set what user login with what data what data right so when you dispatch so you should log in with some data but what data we're going to actually give it well that's going to be up to us to figure it out right let's do that right now we have name is equal to what let's do this right here say let user is equal to result.user right remember we got that from where from here you see right there right there so user result.user is this right here specifically boom okay so now we'll do set user login okay and we say it's gonna be name is equal to user dot display name boom again coming directly from the data here display name right here you see next up email okay user.what user dot mail okay next up is going to be photo so photo okay user dot what photo URL which is coming directly from where from here right there fold the URL right there so you see there's a reason for everything that we're doing okay boom so now if I sign in if I click sign in again technically I should have the nav menu appear in here technically okay let's go ahead and try that out so let's go ahead and see sign in all right so I should really kind of like so it's gonna happen is it still going to dispatch the user login that's going to save it inside the global State want to save in a global state that means this will be right here updated automatically and once this is updated you see this becomes what not truthy but falsy and so it's going to show us a nav menu that is it let's go and try this out okay all right let's go and click login oh did you guys pay attention to that did you guys pay attention to this look it just showed up oh let's go that's so good give me one of Applause everybody hurt anybody I might just applausing for myself that's fine too that's fine too yeah there you go right so we got that portion working that's okay it makes me really happy and honestly that is it that is it okay and once we have this let's go ahead and focus on the sign up feature so we need to be able to sign out as well right and the signal happens when I click on what when I click on this right here I click on this I should technically sign out all right let's go ahead and do that okay so create a sign off function so we have con sign in const sign out out is equal to right here right there it's also equals to a function all right and what's going to happen here is of course we'll remove we'll assign the user out and to do that we'll do auth DOT sign out like so right and once that's successful we'll say that then function well dispatch a functionality well dispatch and it will dispatch what well user slice dispatch set sign out right that's the functionality you need to use that means we need to import it set sign out okay save that beautiful all right that's all good set sign out so this patch set sign out functionality and honestly that is it my friends and one small thing we can do is once you sign out all we have to do at this point is just simply redirect you back to the login page so let's try that right now now to do that we need to use something called history so we'll use here import use history look use history this is part of reactor react router Dom history from react Dash router Dash Dom and the way you use this like this right I'm gonna say const history is equal to use history beautiful and all I do at this point is I say this history that push so basically after all is said and done I just do a history that push I would say my friends let me see where is there wizard where's it where's it where's the where's it right there here I do history history that push basically and I push to the the login page so we'll say login that's it login page so if I sign out now we need to of course we need to go ahead and click on sign now so let's go ahead and do on click on the user image so on the click of the user image we'll sign out the user so on click right there we're going to sign out the user foreign save this so we have sign in sign out that's all good okay let's try this now you guys ready for this are you guys ready for this all right boom sound you can run Applause yay yay I'm pausing myself again dang it okay so log in all right classic level programmer all right beautiful that's exactly what we just got right so okay now of course we we logged in no and what we can do is after you sign in right we can also after you sign in we can also dispatch you to a different page so let's go and do this so we'll say uh history.push now push what the push to where to the home page right that's it there we go so if I let's go ahead and sign out again okay I did that that's fine right let's do history that push to the home page which is this one log in because the clever programmer boom oh look at that you guys ah it's so awesome so look at that and then I click sign out again oh my God it's still good and then hey let's go so there is one issue here however and it's the fact that for example you see if I refresh this basically the user is gone that's that's the issue here and we can actually kind of fix that by by setting the user whenever we kind of like um on the Heather so the way to fix that is very simple and again the reason why this happened is because the state is gone the state is gone once I refresh the page the state is gone that's it sayonara bye bye baby that's it we're done right so to fix it we're going to use off on state changed right and we're going to use use effect with this one too so look at this we'll say use effect use effect right here I'm going to say auth auth on state changed so we'll say uh use effect use effect right there okay okay we'll say basically on the change of let me see when you first log into the page right here when you first log in we'll do the following we'll do auth auth dot on of State changed okay it could be async we're going to grab the user and basically it's gonna be really simple right all that happens here is the user exists right there right because here's the thing um a Firebase remembers the user in cookies in a cookie and so that's where we get this right here right it remembers the user in the cookie and so say if user user then we do what then we do again we do dispatch like the site user login again dispatch that user login again and then we do history dot push dot push dot push home page down there we go uh oh this is more important right there boom that's it there you go so you see let's think about if I refresh now you see you see the user is actually being set right there you see when I refresh the receiver here the users being set if I sign out I sign out I sign it back again classic color programmer let's go let's go to here oh look at that guys that my friends is pretty much it we have finished with more well all the functionality we wanted to get done in Disney plus clone you can my friends you can sign out you can sign in anything you can do pretty much so sign out login right because your clever programmer beautiful right there click on individual movie watch the movie go back oh god let's go yay that's what I'm talking about we have one last thing to do that we're going to try right now is we're going to try and deploy it actually as well I think it's actually deployed it's deployed on our side if you want to go ahead and deploy it on your site if you want to try it out because on our side is actually deployed already so um if you want to deploy it it's not that hard if you undeploy it just go ahead and let me see let me show it to you on your side deploy it right do Firebase deploy deploy deploy right with react right here right find that right here there's a really simple explanation how to deploy a Firebase application right you can do Firebase login Firebase in in it do hosting that's all you got to do right from that point on all you have to do is when it says or is it where's the where's the full Firebase project for this directory you select your project you created after that you do Firebase deploy and honestly that's pretty pretty much it all right that's all you got to do uh so yeah that's how you deploy a bar than that guys and that's it we are done we have our app fully built let's go ahead and log in yet again here so who's still with you who actually was able to kind of finish it with you is anybody able to finish your part partial with me anybody here anybody no anybody or you can oh Juliana you did let's go Juliana beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful so guys for those of you who are on YouTube let me go bring you guys up on YouTube I see all so many comments it's insane so many comments awesome thank you so much for the amazing amazing support I see all you guys on YouTube right now holy moly we've got a great crowd

thing hopefully you're able to follow along me out of that that's it I'll see you guys in the next video this is fun this is a lot of fun oh my God it's all good so good no try questions all the best I'm I'm so hungry oh yeah foreign here's the app that you're going to be building today the clubhouse clone all right now you're going to have a screen that's gonna welcome you like this so you go okay let's enter my username and get inside all right here you can put your phone number and hit next now it might send you a code you put that in okay it's dummy it doesn't actually send you a code and then you hit next well are you going to enable notifications to know when people are talking you know what I actually will so I'm going to hit allow boom enter the clubhouse clone we're done with the onboarding flow now we are on to the logged in user flow we have our header at the top with our header components that are going to be there no matter where we go and here is our app and we're seeing which users are talking with each other how many people are in the room how many people are actively talking right I can start a room I can hit social I can hit let's go and boom look at that a loader popped up and then the room started now I can see that there are two people in the room I can hit the mute button and actually mute I can unmute all right and if I wanted to I can just click leave quietly and leave out of there nobody even knows that I was there and notice that I'm actually using bottom sheet which is something I'm going to show you with the react that you can use when I click things change and I'm doing using the react hook for use state right State Management and I'll be able to switch between them and look the text at the bottom changes other things that are happening in this app is if I click the profile it takes me to the profile page and here rafikaze has zero followers 51 following clever cozy right and how am I making all of this styling happen right here let's go back and let's go to the explore page and look at how beautiful this page looks and how are we making this page look as beautiful right so how do we have this component here I'm using using Aunt D for this which I'm going to show you guys in this video we have our subheader component at the top Explorer with that back button right there okay I'm also using fire um icon so like boom we got this one right there all right languages how am I making all these cards appear and it looks really beautiful and look it's dynamically doing this right so I have data in a Json file and it's looping through and showing all of them so how do you actually do that with components and react you're going to learn how to do that so this is the clubhouse clone that you're going to be building this is one of the most advanced frontend projects and one of the most creative ones that we have done on this channel I think it's gonna blow your mind and I think you're going to be blown away by all the Advanced react.js Techniques that you learn so heavy front end build I'm excited I'm ready to just jump in and get some get my hands dirty I hope you're ready and I hope you're excited it with that said let's just smash the like button okay and subscribe to the channel because it really helps spread this video out if all you do is smash the like button doesn't cost you anything but changes my freaking life okay puts a video in front of people and our goal at clever programmer and so 5 000 people get jobs this year okay so I'm really really excited about that I love your beautiful face and we're going to be getting in to the video now let's go all right so let's just get straight into the build so first things first open up your command line so I'm just going to open up my um I term for you it'll probably be just regular terminal okay and uh you can make this folder wherever you want but I just like to go into my GitHub I have a folder called Banger projects that's where I like to put all of this and then I'm just gonna do create react app or you can do npx create react app okay like this and I will do Clubhouse clone and hit enter so at this point we're just gonna wait for the installation to be done as soon as the installation of your project is done and it's initialized then you're ready to get started okay and they're going to be a couple of differences between what you're doing and what I'm doing maybe you use npm maybe I use yarn so wherever I use you see me using yarn okay I'm gonna be using yarn add you're going to be using npm install okay so don't let that freak you out as we get into it now I'm going to go into my Clubhouse clone folder and you'll see hey that folder exists and I'm inside of it and now what I want to do is I want to open up my visual studio code and I'm gonna hit oh I'm gonna go to GitHub um I have my Banger projects folder and inside here I got my Clubhouse clone and you can just go ahead and open up your new folder that you made I'm gonna go here app.js kit command J to open my up up my command line and then I'm just gonna do yarn start and on the right hand side you're gonna see my server open up and I'm Gonna Keep it running right right there okay so at this point you should be at this part where your little circle is spinning and now another thing I want to do is I'm gonna go ahead and add so whenever I do yarn add what you should do is you should do npm install like that okay so I'm gonna do yarn add I'm gonna add bootstrap to my project because we're gonna need it okay so let's go ahead and install that and once that's done installing you should be good to go as far as bootstrap is concerned okay and then we're gonna go to our index file index.js and actually right underneath here I'm gonna do import bootstrap dist CSS bootstrap mn.css okay just like that so this will allow us to actually import bootstrap because we're going to be needing it throughout this project and next up let's actually just reset all of the styling so that's another thing I like to do so let's go ahead and just remove our index CSS s file completely I'm also going to grab everything in my app.css and just remove it and hit save and then let's go to our index.js file and let's remove this line where we have index.css okay because we just removed that file so of course on the right hand side is giving us an error about that and complaining okay so let's go to app.js sometimes when you run into errors just hit refresh usually what's especially a lot of The Styling errors that you're going to run into it takes care of a lot of those now the last part of the reset is going to be let's go to our app.css and in our app.css let's just add some styling okay so let's go to my root here and how I'm going to style it is I'm just going to say text color again this is going to be the text that we're going to need for the clubhouse style color text okay let's give it this text here dope and then I'm going to do button background color okay so now we got our button background color as well let's hit refresh that should be good okay beautiful and let's now go ahead and uh give it our HTML a scroll behavior of smooth and then body I'm going to do margin zero so this is so I can remove any uh styling that react comes with so that's why I want to specifically say margin zero and just like remove any of those okay even though we removed index CSS but it's just good to go ahead and do that for resetting purposes font size one em and then font family we're going to do new triff Pro like that all right now let's actually work on adding the welcome page uh inside of our clubhouse clone alright so the welcome page that we're going to be working on is going to look like this okay so let's go ahead and work on that so first things first I'm going to go to my app.js and we're going to remove pretty much everything that I have in here okay and honestly just for now let's just leave it with like a dumb H2 and just say let's build the clubhouse clone okay just so there's something here and of course because we um let's also remove the logo and hit refresh cool and here we have let's build the clubhouse clone that's all you should have right now now we're gonna work on and add some of our components okay so let's go ahead and add our welcome.js so I'm gonna build a page so let's go in our source I'm going to create a new folder and it's going to be called Pages just like this and inside of pages I'm going to have a file and it's going to be called Welcome JS okay and we're going to do import react from react okay now let's we're gonna go ahead and Link this file in just a second so I'm going to say export default function welcome okay and then let's just have it return something silly for now like I'm gonna say stew I am speaking from the Welcome JS file okay I want to just Hannah potato symbol because why not so I'm already exporting this let's go ahead back to our app.js and Link this file now so I'm gonna go here and let me actually just try to do this let's see how intelligent it is Boom so you can see that my import automatically happened import welcome from Pages slash welcome and I I'm speaking from the Welcome JS file so now these files and components are linked and let's go ahead and keep adding things uh to our welcome component okay so let's start off from I'm gonna remove all of this just for now we're gonna hit return and then I want to do and create a div and let's go ahead and give this a class name of I'm gonna do Styles and do style this autocomplete is aggressive style.welcome container okay and now it's going to be complaining about hey style is not defined well no worries we're just gonna go ahead and make the Styles now so let's right click into our source file and I'm going to create a new folder this folder is going to be called style and this is going to create all our styling and in here I'll create a new file and it'll be called welcome welcome dot module.css just like this so this is our page and this is the styling that goes with that page okay so they're just gonna work hand in hand now inside of here let's just add some level of styling so I'm just going to say welcome container okay and let's just add padding of 3 Em by 1.5 am okay just like this so I'm going to leave this as is until we run into our next problem let's hit refresh now it will still complain that style is not defined well that's because you probably have to actually import it at the top so let's go import style from style welcome okay let's do it like that and we're gonna do welcome dot module dot CSS okay so now it should be good to go okay so now inside of this div we're gonna add a H1 and let's just have that H1 say welcome so now there you go we got our welcome and the reason why you have that padding is because we added a bunch of padding probably three em padding from the top and then 1.5 on the side so you get the welcome right here if I went back to our styling uh where did we have the style here right if we change this up it's going to do something different if I change that to 1.5 it's going to be different so here our styling is connected and it's working and that's a really good sign okay now we're gonna have um this one all of these okay so we're gonna create a new styling for this so let's go ahead and do that so right underneath my welcome I'm going to create another div I'm going to give it a class name of let's go with style dot welcome info all right and then welcome info I'm gonna have a paragraph tag and we're pretty much going to start off with the with just some copy and I'll just say hey we're working hard to get Clubhouse ready for everyone while we wrap up the finishing touches okay we're adding people gradually you don't have to copy all of that with me but I just like to add it because this actually makes it look like a real clone you know so like just going one step further to make it look very very real okay so that's why you know if you want to do it just do it with me because your project is going to look freaking phenomenal all right to make sure because sometimes what happens is if your project is just too dummy of a project recruiters are going to look at it and they're gonna be like looks too dummy but adding a little bit of this even though it seems like grunt work might add a wow factor to your project all right so that's why don't get lazy here just work with me all right and then I'm just gonna say noting making sure nothing breaks cool all right so that's uh good and let's see do I want to have all of this I can I'm going to be lazy and I'm just gonna copy it okay I'll give you a deployed version too and then you'll be able to copy it from there as well so we'll put another P tag here and I'll paste all of that cool and then do I have anything else okay the last it's the last finishing touches okay so let's go P tag oh whoa what happened there P tag let's paste it alright so our second P tag all the all these look good but I think one of them might need a little bit of styling work so we're going to go ahead and do that in a second but right now more importantly this is going to need some styling so let's go back to our module.css all of this is going to need styling so now let's style our container so I'm going to go display Flex that's going to enable Flex mode and look at how pretty it looks yeah we're done I'm gonna do Flex Direction and uh we'll start off with column okay back to normal back to where we started and then I'm going to justify content with space between cool and then let's do align items like start okay hi let's try 100 VH so that gave it a nice little height from the top and then let's go ahead and add a background color and that's going to do magical stuff right that's going to give it that Clubhouse background color and it's going to start to look nice just like that pink all right so if I remove this background color looks regular looks white I added and now it looks like oh maybe a little clubhousey okay now what I want to do is now let's style the welcome containers H1 which is going to be that welcome okay so let's go welcome container H1 so I'm going to select that H1 and let's style that bad boy so fine font size I'm gonna go with the 1.7 em so let's make that a little bit smaller give it a font weight of 500 okay refresh cool font style I'm gonna go with normal and then margin bottom let's go zero cool and then color I'm just gonna use the variable of the color that I made for text color and then we'll be able to reference that dope okay and then let's style our welcome info class so welcome info height let's go with 253 pixels okay and I'm gonna go over flow Auto dope so now you can see I have like this little scrolling thing so now it just doesn't keep just going down I can actually like scroll up and down there's another reason why you should add the dummy content right even though it seems like grunt work to add all this it's good because once you have it you'll have if you don't have all of this text and you won't even have that like scrolling functionality all right and then let's go and um style the paragraph tag so all of this stuff that's wrapped in paragraph tag so I'm going to go ahead and style that now so let's go margin bottom I'm gonna go to em on this thing cool and let's go color and again we're going to use the text color font size I'm gonna go with uh one em on this thing and let's see font style normal should be good okay and font weight 400. so again when sometimes uh some of this stuff doesn't work refresh and you'll see the difference so for example if I change this to like something ridiculous like 900 it'll it should show you okay so this is just to make sure that hey like things are things are working as expected all right so now what I want to do is I'm going to actually take all of this and I'm gonna I want to put it in like a parent container and then style that all right so we will call that component uh plan layout so let me go to app.js so I'm going to take this welcome component that I have and I'm going to wrap it in something called plan layout so it's going to look like this plan layout okay but since I haven't made it yet I'm gonna go and make that first so inside of pages I will create a new folder where you will call it layouts all right and inside of this folder I'll create a new file and we'll call it planned layout.js okay epic now in here let's do import react from react all right let's capitalize that R and then let's go function plan layout and it'll have children okay and I'm going to return this and what I'm going to return is a div and it's going to have a certain styling okay so we're going to use jsx here let's go like this I'm going to go with 100 I'll go Max with I'm gonna need to put a comma here it's an object jsx object okay that's what we're passing in here let's give it 500 pixels and then I'll give it margin Auto okay and then of course let's go to where the div is ending okay we'll end the div here and inside of this will put all the children components there alright so plan layout plus all the children components will go inside of it now let's make sure that we go ahead and Export this export default plan layout just like this and let's wrap this bad boy Lester have you been a bad boy inside of a plan layout all right so I'm gonna hit uh return like this plan layout wait why the does it say plan layout J oh there we go plan layout still says J whatever boom boom so wrapped it up just like this and I'm gonna do import plan layout from and again where is it at it's in pages and then inside of layouts and then inside of there it's a file called plan layout alright so I'm going to get it just like that Pages layouts plan layout hey look at that starting to look a lot more clubhousey okay great progress so far and now let's actually start adding links on this page so then we can navigate out of the home page right otherwise we're going to be permanently stuck in the home page and uh that's not what we want okay so we're gonna add uh links to be able to go to the next page now so let's do that so first things first now we're about to start adding routing okay so what that means when you want to do that is we need to install things so let's go yarn add again you're going to do npm install whenever you see me do that and we're going to do yarn add and let me move myself away a little bit here so you can see what I'm typing yarn add and we will do react Dash router just like that and hit enter okay and then the next one we're gonna do is um we're gonna install react router Dom and what this will allow us to do is it will allow us to navigate back and forth between pages okay so that's going to be an important thing so now both of them are installed just in case you missed it yarn add or npm installed this one and also install this one cool so now both of those should be added in your package Json and I mean I'll just show you my packet Json okay let's go my yarn lock they look very ugly I thought they're going to look much prettier but there it is react router react router Dom bootstrap that's what I have you should have those uh things as well cool so let's add them to my welcome.js page um so let's go to this page here hit save and let's start working on it so I'm going to do import link from react router Dom so in in react you don't want to use like a tag that much you want to use this link and what that allows you to do is navigate between Pages without having to do any type of refresh it's really really powerful so take uh take advantage of that so let's go down down down and I'll go right underneath here underneath the Paul whatever section because we want to add uh we want we want to add these buttons and things right there so let's go underneath this and I'm going to make a new div and this will have a class name of and we'll do style dot action button okay we're going to style this in a second but let's just add it for now just so you can see how ugly it looks and then you'll see the prettier version afterwards so I'm going to say link exact two and we'll do get username and after this we'll do class name equals primary button and this is coming from bootstrap align items Center and just like this okay and now it's complaining it's like hey you gotta like close some of this stuff so we will close it in just a second but we have to close our link first so once our link closes then it will be fine okay save refresh all right so now it's going to give us a little error and it's going to complain hey you're using link outside a router so let's go ahead and fix that right now so let's go at the top I'm going to hit import browser router and we'll do from react router Dom okay actually my bad let's do that in our let's do that actually in our app.js file okay let's do that here and let's wrap our entire app in the browser router so let's go browser router okay and save okay so now our entire app is wrapped up in it cool so now let's go here so our link now is good to go and we're gonna add a few things to it so let's go to all right so right underneath this let's go and go get your username actually let's get out of the link tag and I'm gonna do get your username and we'll just kind of like leave this blank for now let's hit save and here it is right we can already see that link it says get your username and you can see that right when I clicked it it actually navigated me to get underscore user that's really dope it happened like really fast and without even refreshing of course we'll need to tell it to how do you route out of this page and then how do you render a new page we'll have to tell it and teach it those things and let's add an image okay and this image we're gonna have a source and of course I'm gonna have you guys get access to all these images Okay so let's go and get this image alright so for now I'm going to hold off on this image we have our username so that's good let's just actually work with the button first and then if we need to add anything we will add it later let's go underneath this all right and I'm going to make another link okay so we have this button here being a link and then we'll add another little button thing and then that'll also be a link okay and then um actually this one just will just be text so I'm going to say have an invite text sign in cool just like we have over here have an invite text sign in cool I have an invite text sign in so we got two links here but now we need to do styling because one looks like a button and one looks like text they're also Center aligned so we need to make sure that we do that with ours okay we need to make sure that we Center align them so let's go ahead and do that all right so now inside let's go to our styling and style this okay so I'm gonna go to my welcome Dot module.css and let's actually style our action button so let's go here and I'm gonna go action button and let's go align self let's go Center cool so now both of those are centered that's a really good sign we will do display Flex okay so now they look nice and ugly but we're gonna fix them in just a second let's give it a direction of column good um we're gonna need to align them vertically as well cool and then of course let's align them horizontally as well with justify content content Center okay cool and now I'm going to take my let's grab our action button class again and let's grab our last child of um of our a okay so let's go grab that and for color I'm going to do button background color like this font size let's go with I really want to make um this clone Pixel Perfect so that's that font size looks good to me okay there we go again sometimes when I'm doing this guys it gives me AIDS I'm like what the is going on change the goddamn thing and finally when I hit refresh everything changes and it looks good okay so if if your styling is not doing anything just hit refresh okay so Watch What Happens right when I add this color right it gives it this uh what is that like a weird ugly turquoise color okay that's necessary because Clubhouse looks like that alright so give it that color it's gonna be good font size we got it working let's add a weight and I'm gonna go with the weight of 400 cool refresh okay good good all right and then font style let's go with normal on this thing Okay cool so so far this is looking good all right now we're gonna add the patch for having an invite page as well so what does the invite Page look like well if I go to the finished version of the app and I go to my invite page it looks like this okay and then if I like you know put in uh some random dummy number whatever it takes me another page and then that actually takes me to this page and when I click it it takes me to the app all right so we have a bunch of screens that we want to work on so we can have a actual normal looking user flow because that's something important as a developer you need to learn how to be able to design that and build it okay and make it functioning so let's go and add that now so first I'm gonna work on the phone confirmation page so we're going to work on the page where if I go here it asks me for this type of stuff okay so let's go and work on that I'm gonna go to pages and inside of pages we'll create a new page new file file and we're going to do page or actually phone confirmation.js just like this all right so now let's start off with importing react and we're going to need to use um we're going to need to do State Management so let's also use use State because we're going to need it and uh that's good cool let's also import Style okay and I'm gonna let's comment this out for a second because uh we're gonna need to create styling for this in just a second okay and let's also import link so it can allow us to navigate without needing to refresh so react router Dom beautiful and let's go and Export default function phone confirmation and what export default does is at the bottom of the screen you don't have to add a separate line for uh exporting this and it allows you to use this component phone confirmation inside of your other files wherever you might want to use it so we're going to have a value set value okay a state variable okay it's going to keep track so just start off with use State and then we're going to do a return div and class name style phone confirm phone confirm and let's go container we're going to work on that container in a second for now now let's just add in this enter your phone so can we see that page right now well let's try Okay so let's try to go to slash invite all right or get user we can't really go to that page so we're gonna need to add routing for it so we can go to it okay so let's do that first so I'm going to go to my app.js and then app.js let's add routing for it so I got my browser router and I'm also going to get route just like this and within my app underneath plan layout what I want to do is I'm going to go uh let's delete this line here okay this is going to be something cool I'm going to do so route exact path and I'll say the home page should take us to this component oh this is such clean syntax I think this is new with react this is a really really clean syntax all right and then we have slash invite and this should take us to the phone confirmation page okay and make sure that you import that at the top so now it says welcome is not defined and it goes so welcome let's do capital W so now that's good and now it says style is not defined in phone confirmation.js so let's go back to our file guys a lot of this you have to get used to and comfortable with reading the errors okay a lot of the battle is like actually understanding what your errors are saying it says his style is not defined and that actually makes sense it's like style and it's complaining so probably we have to actually import style so in our phone con confirmation let's go ahead and do import style from and we're gonna do style slash phone confirm.module.css but now we have another problem it says can't resolve meaning like now I can't find this file and that's because we didn't actually create this file yet okay while we're making our or phone confirmation component let's also create the styling for it so let's go to our style folder and in here we're going to create a new file and this new file is going to be called phone confirm Dot module.css and let's just start off with some styling actually it's running already so let's go back to our code for now so now all errors are gone that's a good sign and if I go to the slash invite page I can actually see where we have written enter your phone and it's showing that right over here so that's also a really good sign that means that's really cool it means our routing is working and this component is being rendered based on the routing so if I go to app.js we say Hey whenever you go to slash invite then show the phone confirmation component okay and let's go to that component it's really really clean okay let's hit save let's hit refresh where did I add those stupid little tildas so we have enter your phone where the heck did I Anthem I can't even see them pretty fresh delete holy crap let's undo okay well I guess you're just gonna have to live with them now um all right well that's it okay let's let's keep going all right so um what I want to do now is I want to style style this thing okay but I'm gonna style it in just a second I don't know man some weird happens when you're demoing stuff but at this point I just don't care guys and uh we just gotta roll with the punches all right so inside of this div I'm gonna create a new P tag and uh we're gonna say by entering your number you're agreeing to our terms okay so I'm just gonna leave it like this you're agreeing let's go agreeing okay and then I'll I'll add a Spam tag let's not end our P tag yet and within my span tag I'm just going to say terms of service and privacy policy okay and then I'll say tanks outside of the spam tag cool but let's maybe give it a space let's give that a space dope so this is looking good by the way I discovered I added it to my entire app so now again a debugging session okay so if I add it into my entire app and it's showing up everywhere then it's not component specific it is global so Global I shouldn't be looking within this component because the Eric can't possibly be here so I'm going to look inside of my app JS and inside of my app.js I have multiple components right and if you notice I've actually added it right there okay so now that's permanently there no matter what page I'm at okay so you you could if you added a potato here it would follow you to the depths of hell it doesn't matter where you go it will follow you throughout the freaking app so the moral of the story is don't be a potato uh oh gosh what have I done now all right let's close this all right all right good cheese okay good good good good now let's go ahead and style this sucker alright so I'm gonna go to my uh phone confirmation module.css and we're going to create styling for this thing those Go Phone confirm and do container like this let's add a padding to it so I'll go 3M by 1.7 em just like this all right let's hit refresh have to refresh every second but that's okay and then we're gonna go display Flex oh so pretty Flex Direction remember call them that thing and you will be much better if you put it in a row you'll probably not be better because row is default and align items will go Center and um so that's vertical alignment okay and then we're going to do justify content Center and that will that will horizontally align things okay let's go height and we'll go 100 VH so that like kind of centers it okay and then I'm gonna do background color and of course we're going to pick uh rap what the what is a wrap color oh okay never mind there's like a weird shortcut that was totally unnecessary let's just add the normal color for Clubhouse clone so I'm gonna go F2 F0 E4 all right and now we'll have the clubhouse color okay just keep refreshing like a maniac and things should be good and then I want to go position relative all right so that's good now we're going to style the H1 just it just a little bit so phone confirm container and I'm going to grab the H1 of this and I'm going to say hey give me a font size of 1.3 am so we're gonna make that a little bit smaller it was really big font weight of 500 font style I'm gonna just have normal and then let's go margin bottom zero and we'll give it a color of our text color okay so this is our clubhouse style text color and then lastly okay actually there's few more things we want to do here but let's still go phone confirm container let's grab the text so the paragraph tags and uh we're gonna give it a different font size let's refresh okay so the that font size is much smaller as you can see here go font weight go font style will be normal margin of zero we'll go width of a hundred percent on it and then Max width I'm gonna say 270 pixels so it's looking more centered on mobile devices now and uh text align of course Center and then justify content and for this one we can even do space evenly and we should be good and then the actual last one where we have terms of service and privacy policy now this should look different than the rest of the rest of everything so let's style it differently okay so again let's grab the P tag and the span tag with inside of the P tag okay that's basically what I'm saying there and I'm just going to give it a font weight of 500. okay let's refresh and you can see it looks just a little bit Bolder than the rest of the things okay and for now that's that's pretty much actually let me go here yeah this is pretty good right now okay I hope that you're enjoying this so far uh we're gonna keep going and the next functionality that we're actually gonna add is we're gonna add um links so you can actually go forward and then eventually so you can also like click the back button and go back from this page otherwise can just be stuck just stuck on this page for the rest of your life alright so let's actually add the input for where people can put in their phone number so for example when I go to the invite page I can now put in my phone number right here okay so we're gonna add that to our uh invite page as well right now we just have enter your phone by entering your number you're agreeing to blah blah blah let's put that and work on that now so first things first I'm going to need to install a library from react so we're going to do yarn add or npm install both are okay react phone number input just like that all right not input input with an end hit enter so that's going to go ahead and install this library on your computer and you'll be able to use this okay and then let's go to our phone confirmation page here and we're going to add this phone input okay so let's go ahead right underneath the H1 I'll add my phone input and now watch I'm going to hover over this hit enter and it should have Auto completed it so or or imported it so you see right there it automatically imported it okay if it did and then just go ahead and import it and we're going to do phone input and inside of this input and actually this will be a selfclosing tag like this all right and you can already start to see that the input is showing up here I can choose International I can put a phone number in so really cool comes with some logos and stuff like that too we're gonna definitely have to style this I'm going to say International okay and then I'm going to say default country and us if you don't know what parameters it has you saw how it all kind of Auto completes it so that'll show you what kind of uh parameters you can play with and after default country we have value which we're going to set to value and that's again coming from whatever you might type in here okay we're going to need access to to this and then that's kind of kind of it actually all right now that we've added the input what I want to do is um I kind of want to add some of the arrow links that we were talking about and arrows for like being able to go forward and at some point being able to go backwards so let's go ahead and do that okay so I'm gonna work on that with you now so I'm gonna go into my phone confirmation.js which I'm already here so that's great and we're going to do a couple of things okay so all the way at the top or we have the phone confirm container right underneath that I'm actually going to add a link and in this link I'm going to say okay I'm going to do this and I'm going to give it a class name of style dot back button and then inside of here we're actually going to use that image well you're like hey Kazi where's that image let me show oh yeah so you're gonna have your own images file but in public images we have them all here okay so I'm gonna need arrow and next Arrow pretty soon so I'm just gonna get both of them for now whoops and um inside of my public right I can create a new folder and I can call it images and I can put my images inside of there okay so let's go ahead and I'm gonna grab my images again when I had them boom boom boom public images and I got my next Arrow and arrow cool take them drop them and now we got them both so I got my SVG one and I got my regular Arrow cool beautiful let me put my phone on silent so nobody can harass me like that again and let's keep going so now let's actually add that image I'm gonna do images Arrow dot PNG okay now let's go to the slash invite page misspelled it okay great we have that image showing up it doesn't look so good but it is showing up so that's a really good sign now let's go underneath here and I'm also going to add another link and in this link I'm going to say exact two and we're gonna go to code confirm and then I'm gonna give it a class name of let's see if I can um first add the the text and then the image okay so let's go here I'm going to say next all right where is that next it's all at the bottom okay so you will see this next Aldo at the bottom might be a little hard to see but there it is okay let's zoom out maybe just a little bit oh already the navigation is working so that's a good sign cool and now to this next I'm actually going to add add an image okay so we're going to say IMG Tab and then the source I'm going to give it is my next Arrow icon.svg and then let's now go ahead and start styling this thing slash and then I will say class name equals ml1 and that that made a little uh you saw what it did right so for example if I remove this class name and hit save the next button you'll see that it actually moves a little bit to the left okay and this is happening uh because of bootstrap now I'm also gonna add a class name to this at the top where I kind of left it blank and what I'm going to say is the following give it a primary button see if that does anything refresh okay so that's the top uh the next Arrow image it's the the next button right here okay so right now you can't see the image that's next to next okay it's really hard to see it it's right there and uh don't worry we're going to be able to see more of it once we style it more okay so for now just kind of like hang in there okay let's go here and uh that probably looks better for mobile okay so we'll we'll leave it at this okay I know it's a little uh kind of like a little difficult to see some of these things but I think you should be fine right now so that image is there now let's go primary button I'm gonna say deflects here and then I'm gonna go and align items Center and basically now what we need to do is go ahead and actually start styling this stuff so I'm gonna go to okay guys so a couple of things I want to do so one thing I want to do is I want to go to my app CSS file and um I want to make sure that my button here doesn't really have any styling so it doesn't come with any outline okay I'm just going to say important right here the next thing I want to do is I want to make sure that my link tags don't really have any underlines on them okay so that's why I'm adding this to my app.css file okay so we'll do text declaration none Okay cool so I shouldn't have really any errors going into this now you'll notice that I added this class name to this next Arrow image and I said primary button but we don't really have a primary button class so let's go ahead and add the CSS for our primary button and let's go ahead and do that now all right so now let's go to our app CSS success and add this code there okay so app.css is right here and we're gonna add it in okay so I'm going to say primary I'm going to grab my primary button class and we'll give it a background color of let's just start off with a pink background color and so you can see now it's highlighted okay the R button so I'll change this background color from that to something that makes much more sense we'll use our variable okay and I'm going to say a button background color like this so now you see that it has this like blue color behind it but it still looks a little bit ugly so let's keep working on it all right let's um zoom out just a little bit now I wanna I wanna add some color to this okay so let's make that how many yes we got here cool so let's make that white I'll add a border or radius and we'll go with two em on this one cool so that that gives it those like nice little rounded corners but it's still you know kind of hideous so let's you know let's make it let's make it work I'll add a little bit of padding to this okay wow that padding really made a lot of difference right you saw the button kind of just let me remove the padding and let me add the padding and that just makes a world of a difference so remember these patterns as you're making buttons as you're making whatever you're making just a little bit of padding or a little bit of margin can make such a huge difference and then I'm gonna give it a font size of 1.2 em okay and if you'd never see changes just hit refresh so you saw the font size get bigger and it's a little bit easier to see now we'll give it a font weight of 500 that's good now it looks a little bit Bolder and then font style I'm gonna go normal cool text align I am gonna say Center on this okay so I think that is looking really really good and let's go back to our app CSS file so now this is looking good now pretty soon we're going to need to bring this back arrow button and con into control because it's it's all over the place and honestly it's taking over our entire app and you know taking over my entire life so I'm gonna fix this now all right so now let's go back to our phone confirmation and here we look look we did we did value right but how is that value going to get changed you see the set value is still unused and that's really how you actually change variables that are like State variables in react right so I still need to do like on change what I want to say is hey call this call my set value okay and that's going to actually allow me to accept the new value and actually make a change happen cool and that's going to update our value in here okay so now let me type stuff in great that looks good because if you actually go back back and you take that on change out right so like if you comment that out watch what happens if I go and I try to type in my phone number I'm going to get an error and it's going to say hey on change is not a function okay and so here let me bring this back and now when I actually try to write it knows actually what to do with that cool so this is looking good now what I want to do is I want to actually add that back arrow and give it a little bit of styling Okay so we've already added that back arrow and now let's go to our phone confirmation.module.css and we've we've added some Styles in here but now we're going to actually add the styles for this button right here because remember this this image is kind of crazy right so I'm gonna actually do back button and we're gonna give it a position absolute okay so now it's like right in the center all right so now if you actually comment it out right it's actually in line with every other element but actually if I make position absolute it is going to be smack on top of everything that's what position absolute does and uh let's give it a top of 10 pixels like this okay and then we're going to give it a left of 10 pixels like that cool and then the last thing we're going to do is we're going to bring that image size under control okay so I'm going to select the image I'm going to give it a width of 20 pixels and there you go that's it okay that uh resizing just changes the game and now we got the back button here we got our next looking good okay we got the big American flag in the middle put your phone number in and I mean I don't know this the screen is starting to look pretty damn good to me with that said let's keep on going all right now I actually want to work on the confirmation screen okay so for example what's the confirmation screen you ask Kazi what's the confirmation screen all right don't worry let me freaking show you okay so I go here I hit next and this is the confirmation screen so this is a very simple screen that's what we're going to work on right now and um it's going to be quite simple okay so let's go inside of our source inside of our source I'm going to um go inside of our pages and in my pages I'm going to create a new file and it's going to be called code confirm.js just like that okay inside of here I'm going to do import react from react like this I want to also get my Styles okay from that slash style slash phone confirm dot module.css cool so this should be in under my pages Pages code confirm beautiful then you back out you go into style okay that's that's good all right and then I'm also going to need my link because that allows me to go to different links without having to refresh okay that's a better a way to better than using the a tag that's what I recommend in react so now let's uh export default function so you don't have to write an additional export line if you just do that here and this component will be called code confirm okay and then in here I'm going to create a div it's going to have a class name of style DOT phone confirm container so we're going to now reuse some of the styling and the code that we've already done we're going to have another div here it's going to have a class name of text Center and this right here text center it's a bootstrap it's it's a bootstrap thing that is basically shorthand for doing text align Center okay so just makes your life a little bit easier now inside of here I'm going to make an H1 okay and then this H1 I'm just pretty much going to say enter the code we just texted you we're gonna actually need to see this so let's go ahead and actually to create the routing for this so we can see this freaking page okay so let's go to our app.js and in here we'll create the routing for so I'm going to say import code confirm from and we'll do Pages slash code confirm so I'm going to get that component and then at the end here I'm going to say let's go like this and for the path it's going to be code confirm and of course show me this component code confirm oh did I misspell it should be confirm confirm and let's actually go to this file and let's do I mean it's confirm everywhere okay I might have just misspelled it here then okay so let's try going here and doing code underscore confirm hit enter uh nothing was returned oh yeah because we don't have a return statements so we'll just do for now I'm just going to do a return and I will wrap this whole thing up in an expression like this save boom okay enter the code we just texted you so so far it's looking good now this H1 let's style it in a specific way so what I'm going to say is uh I'm gonna style it okay actually let's add all the content first and then I'm gonna style it so let's add a P tag inside of this div and basically in this P tag I'm just going to say it didn't receive receive it okay and then we'll have a span tag in here and then in that span tag I'm just going to say tap to resend okay so just like that then receive it tap to resend beautiful now for this H1 I'm going to say give it a um not last name I'll do style and we'll do I'm gonna give it a jsx expression and I'm gonna just give it a object inside of it okay it's just a simple JavaScript object and in here I'm going to say with will be 100 this is inline styling okay Max width will be 200 pixels and then we will use um margin bottom will be 1 em so enter the text we just enter the code we just texted you didn't receive it tap to resend and it looks looks pretty freaking good all right and then for my P tag I'm going to give it a little bit of styling as well we'll go class name mt2 let's hit save so again remove it refresh bring it back mt2 now with this empty two you might not see the difference right away but once we actually add the input box where you actually put in your number okay so for example um here you're actually going to see the difference all right so we'll talk about that once we add it other than that I think as far as this specific page slash screen slash component is concerned the code confirm one I think it's looking good and uh let's now start working on the input okay so now we're going to work on the input box over here so let's put that right underneath the H1 simply do input the type is going to be text because yes we're going to be putting in text in there and then we're going to do styling all right so let's go style I'm going to go with in here I'm going to give it a hundred percent width okay so you just saw this got a little bit wider that's perfect um now all right let's um let's actually do it like an object okay okay with 100 I'm going to give it a border of none so let's get rid of uh the border around it let's go down all right and sometimes you know if it doesn't show up just hit refresh because I don't know why but sometimes the code just won't load up okay so just hit refresh the Border should now be gone and it should look much cleaner we're gonna do text align okay and I'm going to do Center like this cool um and then I'm gonna do outline I'm gonna say uh none what does this text align line do notice we're now about to write I'm writing from the left hand side right text align Center I write I write from the middle so that's good okay so this code confirm screen honestly looks uh pretty good let's just move forward now so we're going to add the next and previous uh buttons to this so we can actually go back or forward right because otherwise we're just going to get stuck here so we want this and this luckily we just created it and this is where you're going to start seeing um some of the power of react this is we're going to see the power of react okay so let's keep on rocking and rolling so inside of our code confirm I'm going to go all the way up right underneath here and I'm going to add a link tag like that I'm going to say exact 2 and we're going to say get username like that and we'll have a class name and the class name will be style dot back button okay and of course let's give it an image so we'll go image on here and I'm going to say slash Images slash arrow.png okay so now that button is there okay now one more thing we need to add and we'll add it underneath this div is create a link I'm going to say exact two we'll say allow underscore notifications notification okay I think that's because that's going to be another one of our screens and then here I'm going to say class name and let's put that okay let's put that below so class name and I'll say primary button Flex align items Center like that cool so now that button is there and it's looking good it's inheriting the styling from primary that's what we wanted okay and um I want to of course give it some text right so here I'm just gonna say next and then we'll give it an image images slash next Arrow icon dot SVG so now that uh little image is there okay let's hit refresh great great great great great okay that's the image that we wanted and then of course we'll do class name equals and we'll go ml1 on this and again this is a bootstrap cool so now this is looking uh this is looking good okay and it's doing what we want it to do so let's keep on going all right so I don't like that uh underline that's happening underneath the next so let's go to our app CSS and what I'm gonna do here is I'm just gonna do a hover okay and on this hover I'm gonna say text decoration and let's go with none okay and let's go let's refresh hover over it okay it's still giving us problems let's hit save here so let's actually go ahead and debug and see what's going on here all right let's go ahead and add the important right here hit save go over and boom look it's gone okay so um sometimes you just have to add that important to take precedence over maybe some of the other styling you have or if you're using bootstrap maybe their text decoration or their on Hover with the a tag is taking precedence but doing important you say hey forget all that this is what takes importance and go with this one all right so now let's add our notification page okay that's going to be another one of our screens so I'm gonna go inside of my pages here and I'm going to right click and we're going to go and add a new file and it's going to be allow notification.js and in this file I'm going to say import react from react like this cool we're also going to import style from all right we've done this a couple of times now phone confirm dot module.css like that and then I'm going to do import link from react router Dom okay all right and then export the function so let's make our component now is going to be called allow notification okay and just you're clear on what we're building here is this one this screen right there all right this is a really this is really important for building out a proper user flow you need to have all of these things in there so I'm going to say div okay and um this is going to have a class name of style DOT phone confirm container like so okay inside of here I'm going to have another div and I'm going to Center align it so let's go ahead and uh class name text Center okay inside of here I'm going to have an H1 and that H1 will say last important step like this let's go to ours um okay and let's actually go ahead and connect this to our app JS and add it to our routing so we can actually go to this page okay so I'm going to import allow notification from actually we don't need this because we should just be able to use this component okay so I'm gonna go here and I'm going to say allow notification and hit save and it's already imported at the top and the exact path to get here will be allow underscore notification so now let's change that URL to allow underscore notification all right and I'll hit enter and I'm on this page uhhuh nothing was returned so we just have to make sure we wrap this thing in a return statement like this save last important step is now showing up okay that's good now inside of here I want to add in another H1 and I'm going to say enable notifications to know when people are speaking okay or talking like that cool now let's start giving it a styling so I'll give this one an H1 and we'll say mb4 alright so you saw that it gave it a few like line breaks here okay okay that was helpful and then we will do for this H1 as well we'll do something similar and I'll say class name and we'll go mb3 okay so that moved it up a little bit okay so that's margin bottom right short for I believe margin bottom and that's how we we add margin Bottoms in bootstrap I suck at bootstrap but this is fun right like we're all learning something and we're implementing it in this project and using it so that's super cool now let's work on adding the notification popup okay so like this little thing here we'll work on that so how we need to do that is first of all go ahead and grab the image so it's going to be the in the image folder that's in the description of the video that you can get access to okay that's where all the files are going to be images all the assets you'll ever need grab this image um this SVG and put it inside of your public images folder like so okay so now we have it now with that said let's go ahead and work on more on or allow notification component okay so right underneath this H1 we're going to create a div and it'll have a class name of style dot notification container and don't worry we'll create that styling okay let's just add all the content first and then we will create the styling for it so just breathe for me breathe in breathe out and relax it'll all be just fine should I all right that was bad but whatever I'm gonna add it in anyway okay uh next up let's create another div okay and I'm gonna give it a class name of uh P3 so this is shorthand for padding in all directions in bootstrap okay way nicer than having to do that in CSS is kind of annoying all right now within here we're going to make an H3 and uh this is going to say Clubhouse would like would like to send actually let's um camel case everything would like to send you notifications just like that cool let's get out of that H3 and we're gonna have a P tag and it's going to say notifications may include alerts sounds and icon batches so we got our H3 that's good you should have your paragraph tag with that information now let's go ahead and um let's get out of this div and let's go underneath here and we're going to create a new div okay and this will have a class name of style dot action button okay and inside of here I'm going to be using a link and this link will do the following okay exact two and this link will take me to the home page and this will basically the text will say don't allow okay so we have the Sexes don't allow when I click it I just get redirected to the home page you saw the URL change at the top that's it simple we'll have another link and this will also take us to the home page so let's actually what I'm going to do is um let's just paste this and we're going to remove the word don't so we have don't allow and then we have the word allow okay and with styling we're gonna separate them out from each other so they're not so close and then let's create an image and the image source is going to be hand icon.svg look at that look at how good that looks okay it's coming together okay just have some hope faith and some patience it'll all come together and it'll look beautiful just like you you are beautiful and I want you to remember that as you watch this tutorial and if you're enjoying this so far smash that goddamn like button break the Subscribe button and help me and help us make this the best community for developers in the world and beat the YouTube algorithm while we're at it back to the tutorial okay so let me um yep so we got this image okay don't care that much about the alt stuff right now and let's go ahead and give it a class name and I'm going to do style dot hand icon okay we'll we'll create styling for it do not worry okay so now all this stuff is done now it's time for the fun stuff we're gonna go ahead and style this page okay all the content is there now let's work on our styling so I'm gonna go to our phone confirm module.css and inside of here let's start off with the notification container okay so I'll go notification container like so um and I'll give it a border radius of uh one em not one m okay okay so we got our border radius now you won't be able to see it until I actually add the Border okay so let's go ahead and um add a uh background color and we will add um I'll make the background color white okay so there you go okay if I remove the Border radius look at that it looks like a square and it looks kind of ugly then I do this and it already kind of looks delicious and you're like man that looks juicy I like it I don't know where it's headed but I am liking this and now we're going to give it a box Shadow and box shadow of zero pixels by zero pixels by five pixels and then we're gonna go like this look at that that drop shadow just makes it pop out and it just looks visually so damn good but a few more touches so work with me here let's go here I'm gonna go notification container let's grab H3 by the balls okay hopefully there are no kids listening to this but um you you know in that case it's just juggling balls and we will give it um font size of one em cool what happens if I let go of this oh okay so it makes it much smaller right boom you saw the H3 get under control because the H3 was ridiculous and uh we'll give it a font weight of uh 500. okay it said refresh cool and then um font style won't really matter I'll give it a color of zero zero zero zero zero like this okay so it's like kind of dark black um very subtle difference there but definitely you can see it if you look closely and then with we're gonna go hundred percent okay boom so let's go and I'm gonna margin Auto this thing okay and um then after this let's go margin bottom let's add a little margin bottom and I'm gonna go with 0.3 em okay makes a little bit of a difference gives us some more breathing room and now let's control the P tags okay so we're gonna go ahead and do that so I'm gonna go notification container we'll grab the P tags and then I'm going to say font size let's go 0.825 em cool let's go refresh and then um let's go font weight 500 okay so now this is starting to look a little bit better I'm gonna go line height of 1.3 so that reduced the line height by a little bit and then let's go margin Auto on it okay so that allowed it to kind of be Center aligned good next up grab the notification container and grab the action button class like this and in here I'm just going to say position relative and then what we're going to do is let's grab the action button class and inside of the action button class let's grab the a tags and we're gonna do a couple of things so first of all I'm going to say display and I'm going to say inline block okay all right so now what I want to do is with 50 okay wow that looks great so don't allow and allow or separated all right so now what I want to do is uh let's give it a padding of 0.5 em nice okay that looks great and I'm going to give it a border top of one pixel solid and we'll make it like so oh so clean okay we got a border top now let's go color let's use our variable and use this and what that did is it changed the color of the button okay now watch what happens when I comment this line out and I'm going to hit save keep looking at the colors they're like blue blue right but then when I do this and hit save they're like depressing turquoise color which I don't know why Clubhouse uses those colors it kind of depresses me but they like to use it so we're going to be using this um dope okay good now let's go again notification container action button inside of it and then we're gonna grab the a uh tags and we're gonna get the first child of the a tags okay and inside of here let's go border right dope and go one pixel solid and that little gray color okay what broke this time all right so this is what got added right now okay right there that's what God added and um that's looking good now let's work with the hand icon so I'm gonna go um notification container let's grab the hand icon inside of there and uh we'll go position absolute and we will go bottom negative 90 pixels okay let's refresh oh where is that image we don't even see that image that image is gone it's invisible but the card the card looks freaking beautiful right the card looks freaking great just because it is border right that added that the other border top added this I mean it's just clean and now let's go ahead and go right and I'm gonna go 20 pixels okay so now we got the hand showing up the hand of God and we'll give it a width of 80 pixels boom home and now it's telling people hey go ahead and allow it okay go ahead and allow it so that this page looks good it makes you want to click allow so then this Page's job is therefore done okay good job if you've made it so far and let's just keep going okay let's not stop and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna create a routing container and it's going to separate routes between logged in users versus logged out users so let's go ahead and go do that right now oh all right so let's go to our app JS and in here I'm also going to add switch all right like Drake says I just flipped the switch now I'm going to show you how to flip the freaking switch and under browser router I'm going to do a few things here okay so I'm gonna say route and inside of here I'm going to say exact and here's something cool I can do I can say path okay and uh there's a couple of reasons for this one it for this is going to be extra added layer of security like people will not even be able to go to these pads um or I'm sorry people will only be able to go to the paths that are inside of this array okay so for example slash so it's going to be the home path for like or the default page right your localhost or your main domain of your website and then I'll have slash invite um we'll have slash uh get backslash get username I will also have code confirm boom boom code confirm and then we'll have allow notification okay so what this means is if you try to even go to a path called like slash bananas all right let's go slash bananas you literally will not be able to go to that path at all okay so that's kind of the point of it and it's kind of cool like that and uh this route is going to end all the way at the bottom okay so it's going to be under right underneath where plan layout ends there we go now what we want to do is we want to add a switch statement that's going to allow us to like kind of switch between which one we want okay I'm going to say switch and I'm going to wrap this thing up in the switch okay so switch is going to end right above the plan layout right there let's see what the error is I got plan layout hmm oh my bad yeah this makes no sense so switch is just going to be inside of plan layout okay there we go cool so we got our switch we got our plan layout um a better way of calling it would be like the onboarding layout right so it's like what's the default layout we want on the onboarding screens and onboarding process when the user is signing up so that's gonna have one style of layout and then we're gonna have a different style of layout once the user is actually logged in okay so like for example this is the user flow right so if I go to the home page here this is a completed version of the app not the home page let's go to let's say the default one right you'll notice that all the text is kind of usually in the middle and there's this background color and there's no buttons or things on the top okay it has a very like similar uh Style Now go to invite consistent style okay same thing text and content is kind of in the middle there's no big things on the top and there you go right but now watch what happens once the user has signed up so let's hit next let's hit next let's hit allow now our layout is completely different so once I'm logged in permanently our layout is going to be different right so it doesn't really matter where I go we have like different styles of layout right and uh they're a little bit similar in nature depending on where you click and where you go but right like upcoming for you goes at the Top If I click explore Explorer goes at the top right you have two invites that goes at the Top If I hit notifications the activity where it goes on the top so there is going to be different layout plans so this is important for you to conceptually understand as we go through this and that's why this freaking thing is so cool here that we're doing okay so that's that you're good with that and now we're gonna keep on rocking and rolling all right so now we're gonna work on the next layout okay so remember layout one the onboarding process layout right that was the aka the plan layout okay and then layout two we're going to call it app layout all right that's gonna be the one that's once the user is logged in so again I'm gonna put in um here parentheses this is going to be for all logged in users and then this is going to be for all uh logged out users okay that's how the structure is going to be so let's keep going boom boom bada bam I will go let's go inside of pages inside of pages inside of layouts we're going to create a new layout so I'm going to set new file and I will simply say app layout dot Js okay and in app layout.js we're going to do a few things import react from react then we're gonna export default function so this is where we're going to create our component it's going to be called app layout and it's going to take in children and I'm assuming it's going to wrap the children inside okay so we're going to go div give it a class name of app layout so then we can you know do something with the styling later on if we wanted to and then it'll just display all the children components within that div and um let's go to our app.js now and in our app.js what I'm going to do is let's go down right underneath where we are actually ending our route right there and we're going to add another route okay and this route is going to be exact path all right and it's going to be an exact path to home okay and we're going to do display app layout here okay app layout like so hit enter so it Imports app layout from pages and layouts close the brackets okay and then here we're going to add our switch cool and um that should be good all right so now we're going to add a home page for logged in users okay so let's go ahead and do that so inside of our switch I'm going to have a route and here I'm going to say exact path path and we're going to say home and the component will be our home component okay just like that so I'm doing this here just to show you like we're just showing you that there are multiple ways of passing in a component I could have also just said home like this I can also remove this Arrow here okay but I'm just going to leave this here so you have multiple ways of how to pass a component okay so that looks good okay so we have our switch there and then our route okay and then this route can be a selfclosing tag because there's not much happening in between that so we can make a selfclosing tag just like this okay and now let's see what happens if I click home and hit enter all right it says home is not defined great so now we're going to make our home component um so let's go to pages and inside of pages I'll make a new file it will be called home.js okay and in here I'm going to do import react from react and I'm going to do export default function we're going to do home and we'll go and just return a empty div okay let's refresh and now it says home is not defined well that's because we need to import it so we'll import home from slash Pages slash home so now it's there and if I added a H2 here that said Hello World um home okay and you can see we got home there on the slash Home Route okay but also you can see that there's no styling so now we're going to go ahead and add that styling so let's go into our app.css file and here I'm going to add styling for our app layout like so and we'll have a background color of a clubhouse okay so you see the you see the background color up there and we'll do height of 100 pH cool so that's taking over the whole screen I'm going to do position relative and then with let's make it a hundred percent okay Max width I'm gonna go with 500 pixels okay and then we'll do margin Auto okay beautiful so now our styling is good to go and now we're ready to do some damage all right now we're gonna work on our header alright so what that means is we're gonna work on all of this and we'll add it and look great and you already know you look great okay so let's go ahead and do that so I'm going gonna go to my com um let's go inside of source okay and now we'll create components because these were pages that we were creating earlier inside of source I'm going to create a new folder I'm going to call it components like so and inside of my components I will create a new file new component and it'll be called header JS okay and I'm going to do import react from react like that I'm going to do import link from because I'm going to need need that from react router Router Dom like so and then let's also do import style from style dot header dot module.css they're going to be like hey guys see that file doesn't exist and you're right it doesn't exist and we're gonna run into a problem so inside of our style we're going to create a new file and it's going to be called header dot module.css okay let's just look at the style slash okay let's go style slash um and that should be good okay so I'm pretty sure that should be good okay cool so now let's um work on this component okay so there's going to be a lot of things that we're going to be doing so all function header like so and I'm going to just do return okay we're gonna have a div and the class name of this div is going to be style dot header all right and again we're going to create all these Styles so don't worry they're gonna not be there yet and then we'll have um link tag okay and this LinkedIn tag will be will have an exact two slash Explorer so when you click it it'll take you to the Explorer page and inside of here I'm going to have an image and that's going to be search dot PNG now before we continue further let's make sure at least this shows up so what do we need to do well we need to go to our home JS and we need to replace all this garbage that we have and replace it with our header component so I'm going to do header hit enter and it should import your header from there okay so now our header is being imported but we don't see anything so let's see and investigate further what could be going on let me remove this div and see what happens still I don't see anything maybe it's the styling of the image so let's go and take a look at that so actually you know of course we don't have this image I don't know like this is what happens when you um sit here in front of a computer for six hours straight and and working on this freaking project and coding you um you know start losing your brain cells so let's get back into it okay and we need to basically add um this you know this PNG file that um we don't have and then I'm pretending to have so let's go in our images and let's grab search because we're gonna need this okay we're also going to need a couple of other ones so we might as well just grab it now so we're gonna need search we're going to need notifications we're going to need invite we're gonna need calendar and we're going to need B1 so let's go and drag all of these into our images folder great so now we're going to have access to all of those okay and let's hit refresh and there we go Tada or nice image that perfectly fits on the screen and looks completely mobile responsive there you go you're done congratulations on your build you can go home now okay let's work on it now cool so um uh let's let's of course style it a little bit because uh if I don't style this I'm gonna get a headache all right if we continue building this so let's go ahead and grab our header and uh display Flex Flex like that we'll go align items Center so this will align items vertically aligns things okay let's go back style dot header import style from okay and this is our header okay great and then um let's uh let's take the images first okay let's do that header let's take the image and we will go with 25 pixels okay let's hit refresh so there you go that is looking great right that looks good we can see it and we like it okay that's the size that we want otherwise it gets too crazy and then um we're also going to work on the nav items in just a second but right now let's let's go ahead and keep adding things to this okay let's throw in some more images first so then we can really see the difference of The Styling because I don't like to just add styling for the sake of adding styling let's go to home and uh we'll just wrap this up in some jsx fragments like this cool okay that's not really going to make any difference but just you know it makes me feel warm and cozy so just do it for me cool uh let's go to our header now and uh we'll add a couple of more links okay so let's get out of uh this div or actually let's let's stay in this div and let's just go down underneath this link and I'm gonna go div and we will create a new div for our nav items okay so inside of our nav items let's have a link exact two and this will be for friends invite okay and inside of this link we will have an image and uh this image will will be our invite image so there you go we got that okay and if I click between these you notice how the URL will change when I click the mail icon click it and it is navigating me right there okay where I asked it to navigate me now we're gonna need a couple more icons to be exact we're going to need calendar and notification and our profile image so we're gonna need three more so I'm gonna copy this I'm gonna go here and I'm going to hit paste and I'm going to hit paste and then I'm going to hit paste again okay so I copied it and pasted it three more times so we're gonna have a total of four inside of our nav bar now we need to change a few things so where it says slash friends invite we're going to change this with upcoming we're going to change this one with activity and this one will be profile okay and then this one here where it says upcoming I'm gonna change that to calendar the Activity one we're going to change this with the notification image so you see the images are changing so if you keep noticing what's going to happen with the last image when I change it from invite to B1 so pretty much all the images and icons we need are there are the calendars and one two three four five yep one two three four five okay great so yeah they're all there so now this header is looking good but of course we need to finish our styling that we started justify content and we're going to do space between and you're going to see there's going to be a beautiful difference that happens and there you go and the space between is not happening between each element it's actually happening between our header and then our nav items okay and in between we have space and that's happening because of this and that's activated because of display Flex all right you see how all of this is connected it is freaking mindblowing okay and I hope it's blowing your mind right now let's go padding 0.5 am and we'll go 1 em on this beautiful position I'm gonna go absolute okay that looks great we'll go top zero uh left zero and bottom zero and uh actually right zero and then that's good cool and then the background color will be the um of course the clubhouse color cool so that looks really really good and now we're going to um take care of our nav items and give them some margin because they look way too close to me squeezed up together so let's actually grab nav items image tags okay and then we'll go margin and let's give some margin between them let's go like this and now we got um some margin between them they look like they have some breathing room and that makes us happy okay so they're looking good so far and or pretty much good to good to keep going and go forward and actually uh work on more things so let's go all right so so far so good now we're gonna start adding our uh daily info cards okay and what these cards are are these cards right here okay so let's start adding those cards in the mix and uh and start working on them so we of course first of all need some data okay because we can't just make cards about nothing so let's go ahead and add some data okay so in my source I'm going to create a new folder it's going to be called data and inside of data I will have a new file and I'm going to call it dailycard.json this is we're going to pull our information from cool so we're gonna have an array of objects hello Json and in here I'm gonna have time and my time is going to be um time is going to be 7 PM okay and we'll try to give you this file too but just to kind of speed up the process here I'm going to um I'm going to just paste this okay so that will speed up the process a little bit so Time title description Time title so again boom Clubhouse Town Hall what is the connection between and talk let's do more okay so that's just us adding data so it didn't really add these cards yet okay so we actually need to make that happen now the next thing we need to do is actually be able to um to have a component that actually shows this so let's go on ahead to um let's go inside of our components and in our components we're going to create a new file and it's going to be called daily info card.js it's going to be our component okay and I'm going to do import react from react import style from I'm going to do Style slash daily infocard.module.css so again that is not done yet we're gonna actually create that styling and of course let's also do import data from we do data slash daily uh card.json okay so this is going to give us access to all of the data that we have now let's export this export default function daily info card like this and I'm going to return and um and let's go H2 and we'll say I'm the daily card like this let's hit save and we need to make sure that this is actually showing up so let's go to home.js and in home we'll add this component so I'm going to Simply say daily info card actually let's go daily info card and hit enter and it will Auto Import this component from the top okay let's hit refresh okay what's the error can't resolve okay so why it can't resolve is we need to actually create a styling so let's go inside of our styling and we'll create a new file and it will be called daily info card dot module dot CSS so that's going to take care of that and you should be up and running now the only thing is well why are we actually not seeing anything from here so let's go ahead and figure that out okay so now you might be wondering hey the H2 here is not showing up because that's what I was wondering and all we have to do to actually fix that is actually let's go ahead and create a new file in our style and this file will be called because what we need to do is push that down it's actually getting hidden behind Okay so we're going to create a new file and this file will be called home.module that's CSS okay and I'm going to dot home container and let's leave it empty for just one second let's go back to home and we are going to wrap this daily card info in a class and this class will be class name equals style dot whoops let's do um style dot home container like that and uh this card will be wrapped in this div and now let's go back wait why does this say style is not defined um oh yeah we have to actually import style from style.home wait slash home dot module.css like that okay now we need to actually add some styling to our home container okay so we're gonna do padding top and we'll do 3.5 em like that we will do overflow Auto let's also do padding left one em all right so the reason why that's not showing up is because this daily here is lowercase and it actually needs to be Capital because it was saying that it was not used so I was like interesting so let's make that capitalized and now okay that padding is actually helping right if I remove this padding notice you actually won't see it so let's add that padding beautiful and now we can see it okay now let's add some padding right we'll go one em on this okay let's go padding uh bottom we'll go 3.5 em okay so there's padding at the bottom it that'll help push out other things that are too close to it we'll go height 100 percent um and Yep this is looking good so the home container now looks good let's go to daily info card okay and let's see if we can console log things right so let's go and console log and see what data gives us this is the data that we're actually pulling from here so I'm going to hit inspect and uh we're gonna go to console and I haven't array and that array has all my stuff in it right so I'm already getting access so it's like if I want to get access to 7 pm time or let's see if I want to get access to where the title is Mind Body game how do I do that so I'll get my first index and then I will go uh give me my title right so if I did that save I now I'm seeing Mind Body game okay if I wanted access to this dynamically inside of my H2 I could actually do that as well just add this some jsx magic hit save and Mind Body gamma showing up here right if I show replace this with one now you'll have that one if I replace this with two so you're getting the pattern here right I'm probably gonna write a for Loop okay and that for Loop is probably gonna show as many items as there are in my Json okay got it cool so now let's just now ain't nothing to it but to do it so let's go ahead and uh do that so in my components let's start working on it let's remove this return here okay let's make it an expression and then inside of here I'm going to have my div I'll have class name equals all right we'll go style dot daily card so this dialing we will create it's not there yet okay so refresh it should be good okay and inside of here is we're going we're where we're going to do our looping okay so let's go data.map so whenever you're looping the dot map is going to come to save the day we get access to that item let's create another div inside of this div we'll have span class name we'll leave this blank okay and then we're gonna go item dot time it says item is declared but its value is never red so we're okay oh maybe these are maybe let's put squigglies right because as okay there you go all right so it's still not showing up but we'll have to do a couple of things for it to actually show up so let's see what we need to do let's go to our all right so now one another thing we want to do is make sure that this is actually returning uh right away so we're gonna do an implicit return and how we do that is simply because this lacks a return statement right so if I had a return statement like this here um you'll notice that it just works and I'm pulling all the information that I need okay but what we're going to do is I'm going to delete this and this and we're going to remove the squiggly and the squiggly and instead we're just going to replace it with a open close paren like this okay and then another one and we're good okay so now it's just returning this all right implicit return here and boom all right guys so now let's go ahead and uh what I'm gonna do is uh right underneath this span let's make another dip and inside of here we'll make a span tag and we'll say class name leave it empty okay and um actually let's not do that um I think let's do it another way so div we'll go span I'm sorry I'm just changing my mind here uh like crazy guys but just hang in there with me I think we should be fine with I think but this way how I had it and um I think I want to do item dot title now because I want to get the title so 7 PM Mind Body game Clubhouse town hall and ism.earth so so that's good and underneath this let's go P tag and let's grab the description now there we go so now we got all of them but what we need to do is make the title look a little bit smaller and gray make the description probably um bigger and dark okay and then we'll add this um background color okay probably add a little border radius and uh that seems pretty good right and then maybe some more things but that seems like a good start so those are the things I'm keeping in mind as I'm gonna go and um create the front end for this so let's go into our daily card uh daily info card module that's CSS and we'll grab this class let's go let's of course add our background color first we'll do E7 E4 D5 just save okay background color is uh showing up actually is it showing up let's go FFF like this and hit refresh okay again I don't know why I wrote daily let's actually write daily card there we go okay now it's showing up so now let's change this 2 E7 e 4d5 okay just like this so now that color is there beautiful all right so we added the background so that's good okay let's add padding to it so it right because right now it's too close to the seven and you know the time and the title and the descriptions too close to them so we'll add some padding and that'll like boom right it makes it gives us some space and makes it bigger and then the last thing is let's add some border radius to it and that gives it those nice little rounded Corners okay what what's next let's um let's add our daily card and Target the div so we're gonna actually work on the div let's go uh display uh flex and again the reason why we're using this little greater than sign that you see here is because we don't want to select all of the children right if I did this it'll select all the divs within the divs within in the days within spans that have divs inside of them whatever right by doing this greater than sign I basically say hey buddy only get let's say like this div don't grab this div okay just the child of this card that's it okay the direct the direct child not my grandchild and great grandchild and great great great great grandchild okay so use that for your advantage but just remember with great power comes great responsibility and we'll go flex start on this cool and then um I'm gonna give margin bottom and we'll go 0.5 okie dokie okie dokie so now you see there's like weird stuff going on with it but it's all good okay that's what uh I think adding display Flex did that right so if I remove display Flex this is how or if I add display Flex right this is how it's looking so we're still gonna need to style it a little bit more and then make it work okay let's uh let me actually zoom out a little bit so if I zoom out it looks better and this is realistically this is probably have a look on a phone but I'm just zoomed in more guys because I am on a giant TV so to you when I zoom out things look really really small right so for you the viewer I'm zooming in a little bit okay so just forgive me for some of the things when they don't look right let's grab our daily card let's grab a div within it and let's grab a span within that okay and we'll go with 20 and then let's also go text aligned and I'm gonna say end set refresh so you see this this went to the right like this let's grab our daily card again let's grab the div within it and the div within that okay and uh I want to style it is I want to go margin left 0.5 em okay so now there's a gap between seven uh the the time and the title in the description okay we'll go display Flex cool we'll go flex Direction and let's go column okay and with 80 percent great so that looks good and um I'm gonna just add a couple of more things so I'm gonna grab my daily card class again and I want to Target to span all the span tags inside of it okay and basically I want to say hey font size of this give me 0.675 em actually yeah that should be good so there we go we got the smaller font size just like kind of how we want it right we're gonna go color are in here and I'm gonna go hey give me a text give me my text color okay so this is more of that um Clubhouse color and then font weight I'm gonna go 500 on this bad boy okay so just adds a little bit more weight than the default now I definitely want to play with my uh that sounds funny now I definitely want to play with my P tag okay and uh we're gonna give it a font size of 0.875 em and let's go ahead and uh refresh this my boy Frankie's in the house let's go shout out to boy Frankie there we go hey hey if you made it so far to the video just say Frankie in the comments and nobody will know what the you're talking about it'll be the most upvoted comment it'll confuse the out of people but you're the squad you're the notification Squad so if I can do it hey all right let's um go here and I'm gonna give it a font weight of 500 okay again you see that pop out just a little bit and become darker and man starting to look good I'm gonna give it a line height Hamid is excited too nice uh line height okay so now the line height actually made it come closer to each other so it actually decreased the default that would that that it had I'm going to give it a margin of zero so let's see what that did right so here's a slowmo replay boom take away that margin and it's much closer together okay um and I'm gonna go inline block cool and um inline block what else do we got okay white space gonna give it a no wrap on this thing so this is useful for in this case it's not going to be too much useful but this line here is useful for like if this screen became too small and one of these words had to be broken down it'll wrap it to the next line okay instead of like running across the screen and having you scrolling left and right but here it's not that necessary all right and then um let's go of course overflow I'm gonna go overflow hidden okay and we'll make that uh important all right and then basically what we're gonna do is I'm going to say text overflow okay and uh we'll do ellipses okay so if the text ever becomes too much I just kind of want it to uh give me an ellipsis so let's actually see if it does anything so I'll make the description much longer let's see if that does anything wow look at that so as soon as it starts overflowing look at that from the front end we can actually put the dot dot dots how freaking cool is that normally you have to do that from the back end right some a dummy like me that doesn't understand front end that much I would normally not do this but it's cool like I'm learning these new features with you okay we're both learning together so it's exciting um so that's actually a really cool thing to be able to do okay so that's your text overflow Ellipsis little ninja hack and then we'll go with um and we'll go 195 pixels okay so that made the width a little bit smaller and therefore the text starts to get the ellipses a lot earlier okay so our home.js is looking good our daily card Json is looking good our daily info card component is looking good our module files are looking good uh so this is good now we're gonna create a room info cards with dummy data okay so we're gonna have room cards now and they're going to have a bunch of information in them so let's go and start adding some uh Json files okay so let's go in our data I'll click file we'll go room card dot Json just like that okay and then room card we'll have boom boom okay and um basically we'll um I'm gonna copy some of this okay because it's gonna take too long to um to hand write this okay and we'll try to give you access to these files too so you can actually uh copy this and add this all right and then um starting from my members I'm going to copy that as well so let's go here and paste that cool and then I'm going to get a couple of more members and uh basically you know complete complete all of my data in here so I got all all of my stuff that completes my entire Json file okay you will just have this out of the box so I got a couple of members here okay so for example what am I trying to do right now so all this stuff here good time we got Calvin Harris right and then we got sriram Christian arthi we got Steven sanovski we got Paul Davidson that data is going to start to be pulled from here right now in our app it's not being pulled from anywhere yet okay so we are going to work on that so let's go to our components let's create a new file and we're going to call this file room info card.js all right and now we're gonna do the use we got our import react from and later we're gonna need these okay even though right now we might not need this but later we're gonna need to you use State and we're going to need react hooks so we're going to need a use effect so let's go from react and then I'm also going to do import style all right from and I'll go style roomcard.module.css like so and I'll also go import data from from data slash roomcard.json okay those are the three things I need access to and now I'm going to do export default function so basically the component that I need room info card it'll take in props and let's open it up and I'll just say return and um I'm just gonna have it return and empty jsx fragment for now actually let's uh let's add an H2 and say I am the room info card so now what I want to do is I'm going to connect this to my home so I can actually just see this file so let's go to our home JS and in my home I'm going to do a couple of things I'm going to add this component right underneath daily info card so I'm going to say room info card and hit enter that's going to Auto Import it at the top and then I'm going to say set items visible equals okay and you'll see what I do here and it's going to be um basically some of these items so actually we're just going to leave it as is I'm not gonna add any kind of extra fanciness to this just to kind of like reduce the scope of the project otherwise it would just take too freaking long okay so I'm gonna make it a little bit simpler so you can have it on your portfolio much faster okay now I'm importing it I'm showing it here now it's complaining hey you don't have the styling for it okay great let's add a new file it'll be called roomcard.module.css and that's it and hit refresh and now this says hey I am the room info card so we got this thing connect did and doing what we wanted to do and now if I wanted to like Loop through it and print this stuff out I could right and then I would basically have access to all of the things that I need right so like for example I could just do data.map I can grab um each item Loop through them and let's do my let's do implicit return here okay and we can basically say what we want here right so here let's just get our item so you're gonna complain all right so let me actually do json.stringify because it doesn't like when I do it the other way so there we go I'm just like splatting my entire object onto the screen if I needed access to like particular things from it I could get access to them right but what I imagine this is is probably we have an array of objects here right and I can Loop through them and get access to them and show the people and blah blah blah it's just a Json file okay but Json stringify is kind of a nice way to just Splat things onto the screen and see them all in one place Okay cool so let's now remove this stringify thing that we're doing here and instead what I'm going to do is um I'm going to let's open this up and let's go um let's open this up and what the that's not what I meant to do at all what is happening okay that's beautiful boom all right now inside of here I'm going to have a div inside of which I'm going to have another div inside of which I'm going to have another div okay is it mysterious enough how many more divs I'm going to have you don't know and then I'm just going to do style dot room card container and within this let's go and add an H6 I'm gonna say hey give me my item.title and then within this let's go H2 so I'll go H2 here actually let me practice that shortcut let's go H2 just like this command and D okay I'm going to do command D it selects I delete it deletes both save boom okay so now I'm getting access to my titles and here I'm gonna get access to my subtitle okay so title subtitle still doesn't look as beautiful as I wanted to but uh that's gonna happen very very soon okay the speed that we're going is going to happen very very soon so let's go to our module file so roomcard.module.css and now all we got to do is just add some some styling okay so let's go and go room card container and I'm going to give it a background color and we'll make it white save and you can see that white happening let's give it a padding of one em one Em which way cool now we're going to give it a border radius of 1 am cool so now we got a slightly rounded Corners let's go border none okay so now it looks cleaner and then we're going to go margin top 0.5 em so each of the cards has some spacing in between it beautiful now let's target the H6 and style that so I'm going to say font size 0.67575 em save so now that good time font became a lot smaller I'm going to give it a color of our text color like so and font weight will go 500 okay then let's grab the room container of H2 font size I'm going to go 0.875 em okay so now that text is a lot more contained it's not as crazy font weight that and now I'm gonna go line height one okay so that reduces the uh the line height that they had and then for color we're gonna go like the straight up black right so let's just go boom cool so it's like dark black perfect that's a room corn info is look looking good now we're making good progress let's keep going let's add let's do add details in the room info card okay so this is going to require a couple of things so first of all let's go ahead and let's do yarn add react icons and remember you will probably do npm install if you're not using yarn like me so yarn add react icons okay so now once that installation takes place it's going to be really good and I need access to a couple of images so I need access to this user image right here I also need access to this user image right here okay so these two images you're going to need so let's go ahead open our public have access to our images let's drag this drop it into our images and uh voila we have access to it okay beautiful then what we need is um we need to work on our room um room info card so let's go to our room info card not here room info card right there and let's work on it so react icons that we actually added has access to all of the icons that means it has access to font awesome and icons and the rest of the icons okay so that's why it's super um useful to use that Library it also has access to material I a material UI icons and evil icons and feather icons so all the icons okay so installing react icons is a really nice hack that you can use okay so use that alright so now we're basically going to add some more details to the info card to make it look like this because we have the title we have the subtitle but we don't have the people's names showing we don't have how many people are in this room we you know there's like bunch of stuff that we don't have right we don't have images of the people showing like this um and we're also going to need icons like this chat icon this filled chat icon and this like person fill that content we're gonna need a couple of things here so let's start off by working on those things okay so we got the images that we needed now we just actually need to like start coding some of this up so inside our room info card uh let's go right underneath this H2 right here and we're going to make another div and uh whoops and I'm going to give it a class name of style dot room members like so we are going to create styling for room members later for now let's just keep going so we got room members let's create another div inside and in this div I'm going to have my images okay and we're going to have user image.jpg and this one so that image is already showing up that's really really good and then this is going to be called user image 2. so we got both of the users but notice that it just keeps running across I can scroll horizontal I mean it's kind of hideous but it works so that's a really good sign and it's looping through so for however many cards we have we have that many uh images right so these two images showing up three times six images showing up currently cool all right so now what we need to do is uh let's go right underneath this div ending we'll create another div and uh inside of here let's Loop through we're going to do item Dot members.map and um remember we're already looping right here so we have access to item so then we're gonna map through each item each item's members and we're gonna do uh the following I'm gonna grab uh any item that's in there let's do this and uh we're gonna have it just returned an expression let's go inside of here and we'll do a P tag okay and then inside of there I'm going to do item DOT first name and followed by item so that person's first name and we'll do I mean it should just be called person right we could probably just call this person as well so we got first name and then we got last name like so and let's see if it's actually showing up anywhere so boom Surya Ram Krishan or the stevensonovsky Paul Davidson we have uh we have this working already and uh let's let's actually name it person unless we have a good reason not to okay now the code um easier to understand and then let's actually add a um let's add our icons okay so let's go all the way to the top and I'm going to do import and I'll say BS chat Dots bschat Dots fill and Bs fill person fill and we'll do from react icon slash BS okay and if I scroll down oh what happened to my freaking oh yeah okay let's add it here we didn't add it that's why and all I'm gonna do is I'm going to say BS chat dots like this and now we got the person next uh and next to the person we have the chat dots okay so that looks great that looks really really good right underneath this we're going to have AP tag this is going to have its class name and we're going to do uh display Flex align items and I'm going to do Center and then inside of it now inside of this P tag we'll write We'll add a span tag and this will have a class name of MR2 okay so margin right we're going to give it some margin right and uh let's just write 1.8 beautiful it's there now and right underneath that let's go BS fill person fill so we can have that icon right next to that okay and then I'll go span and we'll go class name let's do MX2 um and we'll just leave it blank for now okay or empty like basically giving a space right after the span let's have another span here and we'll go class name and again we'll go margin right too all right and uh just in case I didn't clarify what MX was MX is margin horizontal okay this is margin right cool so we'll go and let's just put the number like five here okay and then we'll go and basically do chat dots fill oh okie dokie that looks good so now this page is pretty much done now all we gotta do is uh work on The Styling so let's go into the room card module.css and let's finish up the styling that we started okay so let's go room members and we'll grab the image and first let's control the image because it's just out of control and it's like way too big there we go so now we got the images under control so that's good let's add the Border radius of 0.6 em okay so now already the images are looking really clean um it's so cool like I kind of just want to build an app for our own team now it this like inspires me and let's go like this room members and I'll go display flex and I'll go align items Flex start okay good cool let's go room members I'll grab the P tag and then we'll go font size 0.975 uh em okay let's refresh so now it's looking good we have the images to the left we got the text nice and Center just like this font weight I'll go 400 and uh line height let's play with the line height so line height will shrink it okay we reduce the light height and we'll go margin bottom okay so We Shrunk the margin bottom too so now these cards are kind of getting squished together and coming closer okay and giving it that text color okay good and uh let's grab our room members class let's grab the div inside of it and let's grab the first child in that div okay and what we're going to do with this is I'm going to say hey make the position of this relative and give me a margin right of two yeah boom look at that if I take away the margin right right it makes it makes a huge difference so let's hit uh refresh save and refresh boom so now we got the images on the left we got this on the right now these cards are looking really freaking good right now we want to do a couple of more things and it'll make all of this look even better okay so let's go room members let's grab the div let's grab the first child again and then within that let's grab the image and then let's grab the second child like that and uh we'll basically go so this is the second image so this is really cool we're basically saying grab this div inside of that div right so wherever the div is inside of that div get me the image so that's like okay I'm getting you all the image tags and then we're like inside of the image tag get us the second image so like we don't care about this one specifically we want the second one and we're gonna go position absolute and then um we're going to go left one em and we'll go top one em just like this so hit save and look at that this image is now on top of that other image watch what happened when I removed the first child from being relative it has now gone up and it's doing position absolute against the entire browser right by doing this trick here by making the parent position relative then what happens is that the child even those position absolute it's only going to play instead of playing on this entire canvas and then it goes hey left one em and top one em is right there it goes we go actually that's not your parent anymore your parent is actually now just this container over here that contains the images and so then within that when we give it a position absolute and go left when em and top one em it goes right there you see it's kind of like a cool hack that you can do so yeah this card is looking good I mean it's very clubhousey we got the top nav bar working I mean Why Stop Now right when you're about to take over the city and you're already your boats are in there and you're already fighting and you're winning the battle that's not the time to go back home that's the time to keep on going so if you're here keep on going all right right now is not the time to quit right now it's time to smash that like button if you want to become a developer if you want to put this project on your portfolio and change your life and to subscribe to this goddamn Channel and let your friends know about this okay because what are they doing they're probably doing nothing they're just hanging around maybe it's a Friday maybe it's Saturday Sunday they're not they're not doing anything send them this video change their life make an impact with that said let's get back into the tutorial okay so this photo I mean it's looking freaking beautiful um and let's just keep going okay so now uh what we want to do is let's add a button to start a room uh so like for example I'm talking about this button right here all right that green juicy button that's a starter room we're gonna add that because that's what our app needs right now so inside of my home JS okay let's go home Jess inside of here um we're gonna add this thing okay so all the way to the top let's go import and uh we're gonna we're going to do AI outline plus outline outline plus okay from react icon slash Ai and then we're gonna need another one and we're gonna go BS grid three by three yeah and let's go BS okay so what is this well here is the three by three grid icon and then here is the other icon that we're gonna need okay so yeah let's go we got this all right now um we're gonna go down into right underneath our room info card let's get out of this div let's create another div and uh within here I'm gonna go class name and we're gonna go style dot action underscore button and um let's give it let's give this a styling as well so I'll go style and we're going to give it a object so we're going to go position items actually let me think about this because we might not even need that we might we might be able to keep it simple all right so now what we're going to do is um let's go ahead and uh you know the main functionality we're going to start working on is the starter room and how it opens up these rooms and you can choose from different ones so we're gonna like kind of add that functionality so let's go we got this button this div right here now inside of here what I want to do is I want to create a button all right and then within this button what I want to do is um I want to have my outline plus outline plus okay not pick Center we don't need to import that okay great this icon I'm going to give it a margin right so let's just first add it so you can see it so right now this plus is all the way at the bottom left doesn't look very pretty but it um it's there okay let's give it a um class name and we'll do our bootstrap class so I'm going to go margin right two okay so now that made it that expanded it and made it a little bit bigger okay and then we're gonna say start or room like this so now we have a button that says starter room okay and then right underneath that we're actually going to have another button and this button is going to um say the following BS grid uh three by three Gap and let's end it like so and it says is not whoa whoa whoa what okay let's refresh react Dash icons is not exported attempted import error interesting okay let's try to do this BS grid three by three uh refresh okay so the error here guys is this I believe is a capital x so let's make it a capital x and save and that should be uh reference error three by three X is not defined okay cool now we got that grid icon showing up at the bottom okay beautiful so that's looking good and uh let's let's now start styling this okay because it looks way too ugly for us to just be able to ignore it and continue so I'm going to go on home container and then we're gonna go and get the action button all right so Pro tip this plus sign here basically means hey get me the sibling action button of Home container okay so they're at the same level so like if if I go in home.js or not home JS where should I go room info card okay if wherever we have home container is there a good example of this um let's look all right so basically here I'm saying hey uh get me the action button that's at the same level as this guy but say that this action button was nested inside here it would not get me that and if it was on the outside of this one layer back it would also not get me that so as long as they're at the same level it will get me that okay that's pretty freaking cool you can do that with that plus sign um little plus sign action here so I'm Gonna Get You The Sibling action button and inside of it any buttons I want to style them the following way so it's not child um it's sibling cool so now let's go and um let's give it a background color of uh transparent and then what we're going to do is border none that should make it look less ugly so you can see all the way at the bottom now it looks slightly less ugly and then we'll go margin left and we'll go Auto that should uh let's see does that do anything it doesn't do anything in this case not a problem let's go home container and uh we'll do the same thing again so action button like this and then let's do display flex and I'm gonna just do font size and we'll go 1.3 em like this now let's do home container and I'm gonna grab the sibling action button and um okay this display Flex actually I don't need but here we got our display Flex okay hold on I'm I'm doing something funny here okay so this home container here right what I want to select within this by the way is I want to actually select the button SVG all right now you can start to see that it's actually in the middle so that's cool so get me the button SVG and then in this one what I want to do is um I'm going to align item Center okay so I'm going to be vertically aligned I want to add padding okay so that was the thing that was missing and that's gonna actually make a big impact on how this looks so added padding and now you can see all the way at the bottom I got starter room with tons of padding but it's like just stuck to the bottom but that's not what I want I want it to be there like all the time okay so let's go down it's there and then it goes away so we're gonna fix that that's why we're gonna give it position absolute okay actually we can even do um position sticky all right so now it's just freaking stays it stays there the whole time um and now let's go position all right and now we're gonna go and do left zero and I'm gonna do um I'm gonna do uh right zero and then I'm going to do top zero and you can see it's vanished and then it comes back up okay let's refresh okay it's there it's there so that's good and we're going to give it a background image actually so let's go background image and I want to give it a linear gradient and it's going to be a transparent 20 percent we'll give it a certain uh the um the clubhouse color here and we'll give it 80 percent so yeah so it basically has a 20 transparent to eighty percent Clubhouse colors okay going from top to bottom like that and now let's go home container let's grab the action button let's grab the button inside of that and then let's grab the first child what was that first child great and um let's start working on this now so I'm gonna go and say border radius to em okay let's go background color and let's give it this color it might be a green color let's see yep so we got this this green happening okay so we will still need to change the text color so let's go and make the text um all white okay good let's add padding actually to it so I'm gonna go like this for the padding beautiful looking much better and uh font size let's go like this beautiful font weight I'm going to give it a 400 all right okay and then uh display Flex align items I want to do vertically centered so that plus sign just got a little bit more centered it was not initially we're going to go and position absolute this bad boy and then left 50 percent okay and then transform will do translate X by negative 50 percent okay so now whether I go up or down it's always there up or down boom always there okay beautiful so a starter room is there our other like little grid icon is there in the bottom right so this is looking really good and ignore that little thing that's my Chrome extension that it's just impossible to ever remove but we're making really good progress so far and then the last thing I want to do there's still a little bit more that we got to do here is um let's go to our home container uh sibling action button let's grab a button inside of that let's get its uh second child okay like this and then let's give it a line height of one all right and then let's go down and I'll do home container again let's get the sibling button let's get the um nth child and I'll basically get the um all right and same thing but this time let's play with the SVG and uh we'll go text color okay beautiful so now all of that is good it's looking like how we want it it looks beautiful and now we're basically ready to make progress and um continue further okay and we're gonna basically now add an animated bottom sheet so that when we click Start a room there's actually a bottom sheet that pops open look at how good it looks so let's go and do that so first things first let's open up our command line and um I'm gonna hit clear and let's install this thing so I'm going to do yarn add you have to do npm install if you're not using yarn okay so yarn add I'm going to do react swipe I'm gonna move my face so you can actually see it swipe able bottom sheet just like that and uh let's mirror my face it looks like I'm actually looking at the code so now it's installed we can put our command line away and uh now we can keep going at it all right so a couple of things right now okay that are happening that are like a little funny and our button doesn't really look that good okay so I'll show you what's happening okay notice on the right hand side we have two scroll bars right now so I can scroll within here and then I can scroll on the outside what the hell is going on that's really weird why is there like two different ways to scroll so we're gonna we're gonna do a couple of things one I want to do bottom zero all right and now this thing should show up cool so now I can scroll in here and it's there but then I can still scroll on the outside which is weird and it doesn't really create a good feel for the app that that's not what we want so let's go to app CSS and in this we don't want to be able to scroll app layout so let's go overflow hidden hit save and look at that it's done okay so it's beautiful the solution was really elegant and simple okay and our problem that we were facing is now fixed and we are good to go okay so let's now keep on going and making progress on this so next up all right so now let's go forward with adding the bottom sheet okay so we already did our installation just in case you missed it for whatever reason um just make sure you do yarn add let me hit up yarn add react swipeable bottom sheet okay because we're going to need that again that's this thing right here I'm going to hit command J and lower my command line there and let's actually add the code for bottom sheet and there's going to be a couple of things that we're going to need to do for this okay so this is going to take a second so let's close out of this go inside of our source inside of our components I'm going to create a new file and it's going to be called bottom sheet.js just like this okay and then we're going to do import react from react like that we'll do import swipeable bottom sheet from react swipeable bottom sheet we'll do import style from and it's going to complain that we don't have this yet so we're going to make this next bottom sheet module.css okay let's just make this file before it complains because it's really annoying when it does so let's go to style new file bottom sheet.module.css there let's come back to our file now and uh I'm gonna do export default function and this component will be called bottom sheet it'll take in props all right and then we'll do returned and we're going to do this okay swipeable bottom sheet and we'll say open okay and it'll take in the props dot sheet visible and then we'll do all right so um let's go on change and uh we'll go boom on change here's what I want you to do buddy I want you to go and do props dot um set sheet visible I'll do props dot sheet visible so basically when you click it just invert its visibility okay so for example when I click here so here it's like off right now the default state is off but when I click it it's on but then when I click it again it's off you see so like you need to be able to set it on and off on change okay and in this case the change is clicking in and moving it down okay so those are going to be the two things that are going to be inverting it and then I'm going to say browse set items visible and we're going to set that to true so far so good all right and then let's go full screen equals I'm going to go props.sheet title it's going to be room detail so if it's room detail then I want you to return true otherwise false and let's close that okay and then right underneath this I'm going to create a div that div is going to have a class name of style dot bottom uh let's go bottom sheet container just like this so that's good and then here we're going to give it a style and we're going to say background color back ground color will be props the sheet title profile okay if it is a profile then give me transparent parent otherwise give me empty okay and um that's it so now let's just close out of everything that we have opened export default function hit save and this will save so that's a lot we're gonna break it down don't worry but right now there is a lot that we got to do okay so let's like keep powering through this and then it's gonna make um it's gonna make sense once it's for pretty much done okay so let's go to our home and um in our home I'm going to go and import bottom sheet actually let's not do that because we'll just import it as we need uh import data from and we'll go data slash roomcard.json okay good and then let's go right underneath home and we're going to now use State finally okay because we need it in our home Js so let's go and import it from here use State beautiful go down here we're going to go const I'm going to say items visible set items visible and this is going to be true and then let's go and do um sheet visible and we'll go set sheet visible and we'll go false and we'll need to do a couple more okay so I'm going to go to this one and we're gonna go sheet create room this will be set sheet create room let's make another one that's loader visibility stability so like this is where we're going heavy on react here set loader visibility and then last one we're going to do card ID and I'm going to do Set Card ID okay and we're going to say you state one just like that all right now we're gonna go down and basically we're gonna say for the button on click I want you to do the following I want you to set sheet visible and set that to true and then we're going to add the bottom sheet and the bottom sheet we're actually going to add below the button and below this div ending and we're going to add a bottom sheet like this okay and if you Auto completed it it should import bottom sheet from the top just like that so we're going to go bottom sheet and I'm going to say sheet title is equal to start room we'll set um let's actually end the sheet it's going to be a self closing tag we'll do set sheet visible to we'll take an item and we'll go set sheet visible to item okay whatever the item we're passing in all right next up let's go sheet visible like this and we'll go sheet visible I'm going to go car detail and let's go let's go data dot find and let's do for every item that we get let's get the item ID okay and check if it's equal to the card ID then let's do set items visible okay and again we're gonna do we're gonna do item okay and I'm gonna go and say set items visible to the item and then let's do set sheet create uh create room just like this okay equals oh grab the item and then do the following set loader visibility to true and then we're gonna do set timeout set sheet create Rome okay give it item and then what I want to do lastly here is set loader visibility to false okay and then let's just give it a thousand second timeout okay or not second but millisecond cool so pretty much one second time out here so a lot going on here in bottom sheet but again just hang in with me um I promise it will make sense okay now let's hit save and refresh okay and um let's go to our app it says sheet visible is not defined inside of Home JS so sheet visible visible okay so let's correct that set items visible sheet set sheet trade room okay beautiful okay let's click so right now nothing is necessarily happening and then also let's go ahead to our styling um and add our styling to it all right so let's go to our let's basically add some CSS because without it we really won't see it so let's go to bottom sheet module CSS here okay and uh and by the way just at a high level just so I can explain what's happening here right when I hit start a room it opens up a bottom sheet right then I can select any one of these now when I click into one of them and I hit let's go it opens up yet another bottom sheet okay so the bottom sheet within the bottom sheet okay that's why it kind of gets like a little complex here okay and also notice if we're lucky you're going to see a loader in the middle unless it like loads too fast so let's let's go you see that you saw that right hopefully you saw that one click it I'm going to click and right there okay I'm sure you saw it so that loader is also are being added in the middle while it's loading so there's a lot going on in real time so let's go bottom sheet container let's go here um where are we adding this class name right there okay bottom sheet container and let's go background color and we'll go ffff and this is our code okay so so far nothing is happening all good let's click here and let's go border radius go 1.5 em let's go padding I'll go 1.5 am followed by 1 nem like this okay position let's go relative on this and let's go height uh a hundred oops a hundred percent okay let's hit so now we got this completely styled it's connected to our file and now let's troubleshoot what's happening oh and by the way I made this one typo hopefully you didn't make it with me so if you go to bottomsheet.js in components um I kept writing visible and so when you do that what happens is when you click right and you hit start room nothing happens but if this is visible right and then you click it and you hit start a room that will happen like a modal thing will try to open up okay even though right now it doesn't really look that good so now let's work on once we click Start a room we want to be able to um basically see something right so like for example when I start a room I see open social close things like that right so let's actually start adding certain things to it so um first things first let's make a new component so let's start there all right so in components what we're going to do is I'm going to right click um we have bottom sheets okay but basically inside of bottom sheets we're going to actually we're going to create a new folder okay and it's going to be called bottom sheets just like this dot J uh not DOT JS it's a freaking folder okay cool um and then in here I'm going to do start room.js just like that all right so we got bottom sheet um this component okay now let's work on it okay so I'm going to do import uh react and then we'll do use State just like this I'm going to go from react okay let's go import style from and let's go boom style bottom sheet.module.css and then I'm going to go import FC Globe because we're going to use those Globe um icons right in a little bit so from react icon slash FC those icons are going to be really cool once we add those that component is going to pop and it's going to look so freaking good okay so let's keep going and add that now let's go ahead and make our component and it's going to be called start room and it's going to take in some props all right and here we go and room set room okay and we'll go use State open just like that and then we're going to say return the following all right and let's close close that guy just kidding um I'm gonna close this jsx expression here and um fragment I mean all right and then in here I'm going to have a div with a class name of style dot switch underscore line let's go like this now within this div I'm going to have um actually no that div let's just end it there for now and then let's have another div all right and then we're gonna have a class name of uh let's let's do text right on this and we're going to add a button to this and I'm going to do style dot add topic button and we're going to create all these Styles so again don't worry so much about it right now plus add a topic okay just like that now we're going to need to connect this to our bottom sheet so let's just connect this to our bottom sheet for now okay so if I hit start a room right now nothing happens so let's go to our bottom sheet and let's import import start room from bottom sheets slash start room and then let's go down right underneath this um actually where it should be at this let's add it right underneath this I think actually so let's go right underneath here and let's do a couple of things all right so let's go inside of this div here okay not not inside here okay because that's where you add attributes so boom right there and uh what we're going to do okay is we're going to uh add our start room component which we imported from the top and it's going to be selfcontained so let's just end it for now let's go set sheet create room equals and passive props.set sheet create row just like this all right we're gonna do set sheet visible equals and we're gonna give it an item and we'll do this we'll go props dot set sheet visible item and props dot set items visible to True okay and that looks good and I think uh pretty much we should be ready to go okay we have a start room component it takes in these things here okay we're giving it like what the set sheet create room prop already is we're passing it that's okay and um yeah so let's take a look okay I'm gonna hit refresh let's hit start a room boom we get add a topic right there okay right now there's no styling on it so it doesn't really do all that much but it's visible and I can see it now let's add the other ones okay so we still have finished this one yet under starter room so we got this at a topic let's go right underneath it we'll go div go class name and uh we'll go style dot select room all right and inside of this div I'll have a button cool and I'll go class name and we'll go room equals open all right so we we're using this ternary operator here so it's either if it's open then use the active style otherwise just blank style and uh another thing I want to add to this is I want to say hey on click what I want you to do is um give me give me a little something something okay so set room open okay so when I click then make sure that the room is now open okay great now we're still not done with this button we're gonna do a couple of things inside of here let's add throw in a div inside this div I'm going to throw in my FC Globe okay my FC Globe component slash icon that I'm getting from um react icon so if you haven't installed it make sure you go and you install it great and let's go ahead right underneath that div and what I want to say is open so that's pretty good let's hit save let's hit start a room oh not not that one let's hit start room so now you see the globe and you see open showing up that's a really good sign so we have certain things coming together okay so now we're gonna do something pretty similar and add the next few buns so let's add another button inside of this button actually let's uh let's play around with the attributes of this button so I'm going to say class name and I'm going to say hey if a room is equal to social then do me a favor and make the style active otherwise leave it blank okay and then uh maybe we'll add an on click for this as well so we'll do on click and I'm gonna say hey give me a set room and let's go social on this thing and then um let's go inside of the button and inside of this button here let's give me a div give me FC Globe let's add a selfclosing tab just like this social let's hit start a room now we got two buttons here perfect and I need to do that one more time for close so I'm going to get a little bit smarter with it and uh I'm gonna grab this whole thing copy it actually maybe let's not copy the div let's just copy the button okay all the way to where the button ends and um let's just add it in and hit save okay and then the only thing I'm probably going to change neat to change here probably is closed set room to closed um and change this to closed hit refresh started room and now I got open so social closed open social close so still a lot left to go on The Styling but hey that's uh you know pretty good freaking start so that's good and in bottom sheet so I've added what I needed to add to the bottom machine I added to this not as good okay now we're gonna do change the style of start room bottom sheet and we're going to add tons and tons of styling and that's going to make things a lot better so inside our start room let's do a few things let's go to where our closed button is okay and where we're closing our div right underneath that let's open up a P tag and inside of here I'm going to say start a room like this and then I'm going to leave this empty space there all right we don't really even need that we can just actually leave it like this that's a better way to leave it they are right autocomplete is Right within this let's add a span tag okay and within the span tag I'm going to say hey if the room is closed can you double check that for me and if it is closed okay do me do me a favor okay if it's closed for people then write for people I choose all right otherwise check if the room is social and then basically say with people I follow so check for that so this is gonna be a question mark like this and then we're gonna do otherwise open to everyone all right so we got multi multiple turn nested if then statements ternary operators but all they're doing is when I click this it's a starter room open to everyone when I click social it's a starter room with people I follow when I click close it says starter room for people I choose so that's really what we're trying to do in our app and look it's working so that's pretty freaking cool right like if I click this it says start a room open to everyone click this start a room with people I follow click here sort of room for people I choose okay beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful angel all right let's go div and I'm gonna go class name text Center and then inside of this div I'm going to add a button that button is going to have a class name of style dot Let Go Button we're gonna style this in a second so hold on to your panties for me please thank you on click I'm gonna go like this and we're gonna say perhaps a sheet create room set it to True okay and uh here so it's going to be set sheet create room okay so set sheet create room set sheet visible set it to true and then the the text for the button that I want is a confetti okay it's just not happening huh so we're just gonna what do I gotta do here tada make that copy it all right so confetti and I'm gonna say let's go just like that okay this is the let's go button so we're gonna create a special uh styling for it okay so let's hit start a room oh not this app the one we're working on so you can see we have let's go all the way at the bottom we have open social close we have added topics so now it's just a matter of styling so let's go to our bottom sheet.module.css and boy oh boy time to get to work so let's go with uh let's go with styling our switch line I'm gonna go position absolute position absolute and I will go top six pixels so we'll we'll start seeing differences a little bit later on but let's just keep going for now left 50 percent I want to go transform translate X negative 50 percent okay like that go height for pixels with 35 pixels uh background whoops background color give me a grayish color okay so it's this line right here okay it's a little hard to see but it's right there so for example if I remove that you don't see it if I add the color you see it right if I remove position absolute then it's to the left hand side uh of my face if I add position absolute then it's there right if I take out left 50 it's to the left again so that's what's that's how this that's what the switch line is okay then let's go add topic button and we'll go background color transparent okay beautiful and um probably gonna go border none on it so it looks cleaner refresh starter room so there we go now add a topic does not have that ugly border around it which we're probably going to remove from all of the other ones as well and color 2 8 ae61 okay this is going to be that green color perfect now let's uh get our select room class let's go ahead and style it so let's go with border bottom one pixel and we'll go solid and we'll go gray on this one beautiful and then let's go padding on it 1.5 Em by zero I'm gonna go display Flex align items Center and then justify content space between okay there we go right so now we have space between and it's starting to look much much much much much much much better life of frontend developers get used to it get used to it as a react developer you are a frontend developer okay now let's go select room and we'll add a button again we'll do border none so I'm selecting all these buttons and removing all of their borders hopefully let's bring this down let's bring that up let's refresh order none let's go back on color and I'm gonna go transparent so now that background color is gone nice this is exciting I'm freaking excited making this with you guys let's give it a round some rounded Corners even though they're freaking invisible um let's give it a padding all right give it a padding okay and then let's give it the um Clubhouse color cool and then line height of 1.2 beautiful now it's looking really good we've squished it together just a little bit let's grab our select room class and inside of it let's do button active so border we're gonna give it one pixel solid and we're going to give it a light C green when something is active so now open is active now social is active and now closed and now closed is active so you see when it gets active it gets that like sign and then we're going to go background color and we'll go light blue and here right style DOT active that's where we're making that happen okay so if it's open then apply that style that's what we're doing beautiful so now I've got the background color so when I click that's oh that's awesome and then we're going to do now a couple of more things okay so now this is to select what's active now let's go with uh button div okay so let's attack the div and I'm going to give it a background color and let's go light C green again on it okay let's boom so it looks a little bit ugly but just bear with me let's give it a border radius of 1.5 let's go select our button SVG and change the font size to 4 am okay so now they're much much much bigger let's go bottom sheet container let's grab the paragraph tag I'll go font size on this thing will be one em okay we'll go color uh let's go text color and I'll go text align Center beautiful so now this text is in the center so that's a really good sign and we'll go font weight 500. okay so now that's looking really really good and then let's work on the let let's go button I'll go font size 1.3 em font weight will go 500 on the Let Go Button uh let's go border none that's gonna make it look clean let's refresh hit starter room so starting to look clean we're probably gonna need to give it a border radius let's give it a border radius of 2 em okay let me refresh oh border radius right now we got those nice rounded Corners we'll give it font color of white okay now we need to of course give it a background color of that green 2 8 ae61 save nice now probably let's give it some padding 0.3 e m by 2 em yes nice that works and then let's go a text align on this thing and I'm gonna go Center oh man that is looking freaking beautiful okay start a room wow I am excited by this app man this is so freaking cool zoom in zoom out start a room starter room wow and I'm excited okay so that looks great The Styling is coming together and my neck is about to fall off I've been shooting for about eight hours but you know let's go let's freaking go you guys I'm pumped for you let's keep going so we got an added loader okay so let's work on that and uh let's work on also our home a little bit so let's go on our home JS and we're going to add I mean honestly we don't actually really need the loader the loader takes a bunch of work and does so freaking little but okay fine we can add it we can add it I won't be lazy I won't be lazy let's just go all right so let's go loader visibility okay and um here's what we're gonna do all right so my bad I meant to put parentheses here okay cool so loader visibility it's going to have a div inside of it all right and inside of this div we're going to have a certain styling okay so I'm going to assist dialing um and let's go position fixed and then I'll go top zero okay and we'll go uh right and we'll go bottom zero and we'll go left zero and we'll go display uh flex and align items and I'll go for Align items I will go Center and we'll go justify content and that'll also be Center so that's good so far let's go here I'll add in an image and we'll go images slide slash loader dot GIF so if we don't have this loader let's go ahead and bring it into our world I'm going to go to my public file images we got our loader right here okay so let's open up our uh let's open up our public we got our images let's drag our loader and drop it in there okay beautiful and let's close out of it because we need that loader okay and then we're going to have another beautiful little thing so basically this is a ternary operator right either this is going to happen if loader visibility is true or whatever is in this parenthesis is going to happen okay so here we go so in this parentheses it's pretty simple and it's going to be nothing so either display the loader doing its fancy things otherwise just do nothing and don't show anything and great so pretty freaking simple okay um not complicated simple so you see the loader came up right right when I hit let's go you'll see the loader popped up right there and it was there it's there as well when I hit it let's go and it's there again okay so very simple and very very clean and I think it actually shows up for one second I think that's why we did the set timeout right that's why we did set timeout and that allowed allows it to show up for one second I think if I if we do it 10 seconds here and then I hit start room and then we hit let's go this will probably show up for 10 seconds okay so we're just kind of like hard coding our visibility so see what I said like trust me it'll make sense as we go on okay so it's hopefully already starting to make much more sense okay so we added the loader now let's go ahead and add new room bottom sheet so we'll go ahead and uh do that yeah new room is going to take a little bit but I think this one is going to be a pretty um pretty important one you know that we that we really need all right guys so now what we want to do is um we want to basically add a new room inside of the bottom sheet okay so what does that mean well when I click Start a room in my finished app and I hit let's go look it starts a new room okay and this is a bottom sheet okay so we have two bottom sheets one when I click Start room and one when I click let's go all right so those are two things that two types of sheets that we're gonna need all right so let's just get started on that and let's start working on it um I'm gonna work on my component so let's go inside of our components right click and we're going to go inside of our bottom sheet folder and in here I'm going to create a new file it's going to be called new room dot JS again we're going to import everything we need we're going to need to use uh use State at some point so let's get that now let's import The Styling okay and if there's any styling that we don't have yet we just go ahead and make it so we know it's going to complain at some point about not having room detail module.css so right click and let's just make it just in case we don't have it so room detail dot module dot CSS just like that all right so we got this um made so that's good now let's go back and get some fonts that uh get some fonts and things that we're going to need some icons I mean outline file okay and I'm gonna do from react icon slash AI okay beautiful and uh the other icon I'm going to need is BS mic mute fill and let's give it BS just like this now we're creating a new component called new room and here's we're going to be using our state variables like mic mute visible and set mic mute visible and it's going to start off with false what does this mean so if I go to my finished version of the app if I hit start room and if I hit let's go look all the way at the bottom right you're going to see the mic if I click that mic it becomes and this becomes mute as well right here and when I unclick it there's no mute that's there anymore how's that happening well this is actually where um we're using our state variables to make sure that we keep that information we can show it in real time okay so that's what's really going on there and let's go down and I'm going to go card props.card detail beautiful so we got our you state hook and we're using it here that's beautiful and it's helping us all right so now I want to make sure I return and we want to return something so right now I'm just going to say potatoes all right potatoes so I'm not going to return anything useful but what I want to do is connect this component where it's going to be shown and that way then when I'm making changes I can actually see them happen in real time okay so we're gonna go do that so let's go to our home file home.js and let's go down down down where should we add this okay so right when where am I doing my timeout cool so right underneath where I'm doing my timeout we're going to add this and we're going to add a bottom sheet just like that and we're gonna go this is going to be a selfclosing tag so let's just close it right away we're gonna go sheet title is new room and set sheet visible is going to be taken an item and let's go set sheet create room okay I'm just going to set it to Whatever item we pass it boom let's go sheet visible like this and uh card detail we're gonna do new room data and set items visible I'm going to do taking an item and we'll do set items visible to item okay now this new room data that we're giving it here it's clearly not imported so let's go ahead and import that so I'm going to do import new room data from um and actually we need to get our data as well okay because we're going to need to use that data at some point so first let's go ahead and make that file so we have our new room Json file okay which is this one right here and again ours is pretty simple we're going to keep it really really simple so let's go inside of source and inside of source let's go inside of data and in my data I'm going to create a new file and we're going to call it newroom.json all right and let's just paste all of this there okay so that is paste pasted all right so if I go to our app right now our app is saying hey new room data is not defined so we made our data now we're just simply need to import it okay so I'm going to say import new room data and we're going to say from let's go bottom sheets Slash new room okay so bottom sheets slash new room just like that all right and that's gonna really um that's gonna basically import that so that complaint should stop now it says hey can't resolve this so let's go check what is happening right now and why I can't resolve that so new room data okay currently I'm in my pages in home.js so I might have to back out of the directory and then go into bottom sheets let's check pages home.js yeah might have to back out and go to data right so back out slash data slash bottom sheets and new room set refresh let's make this small lowercase it actually let's uh Delete let's delete this because we cannot import that there but let's go actually let's go new room data not in bottom sheets because that's not where it's at I don't know why I'm going crazy so let's go data Slash new room okay and let's do dot Json okay let's hit refresh and now that's good okay beautiful exactly what we're looking for all right so so far when I hit start room and I hit let's go it just keeps opening uh new sheets but it just feels like they're kind of on top of each other right so we're going to go ahead and fix that and make it so it actually opens new sheets okay so let's go and uh let's go back into our um let's go back into a bottom sheet.js okay and make a couple of changes so let's go bottom sheet.js this is our component okay and to this component what I want to do is let's go under let's go here and let's import our room so important new room from and I'll go bottom sheets slash new room okay so now we got that import and let's go to all the way where we added a background color for profile and right underneath here all right guys so now conceptually this is important to understand before we continue so here I have this one that start room right so this sheet title whoa all right this sheet title is going to be um this is our start room okay that's what the sheet title is here and um when I click let's remove this when I click let's go right and it opens up a new room now the sheet title is different so now the sheet title is actually a new room okay so this is going to be important for us because based on what somebody did we're going to show them a different sheet okay and that's how we're able to do that so just keep that in mind as we go along and write the next part of the code okay so I'm just going to start off with this so let's I'm going to cut this we're going to need this in a second I'm just going to cut this for now okay and here's what we're gonna do I will make the squiggly here and we're going to basically say hey if this sheet title is new room okay question mark then I want you to do the following show me the new room okay so this has similar code and uh we're going to paste it and let's do new room as our component okay and I'll import it so if I hit enter hopefully that imported it oh no already imported so that's good a new room we're gonna do the same types of things but let's go down and we're going to say card detail is going to be props Dot card detail just like that we are going to do set sheet visible but we won't need this or do this okay so let's go ahead and fix what it's complaining about we got our new room opening up here and now the new room actually needs to close so we probably need to close that within this there we go so if you see new room then show me this component now on the other hand though if you see start room like this then I want you to do something different I want you to do this okay so now we're getting into nested ternary operator sometimes it gets like a little bit tricky to visualize this but just follow along with me here and once this is done you'll be able to see what we're doing here okay and now I'm going to paste my start room one that we had earlier okay and uh let's what do we need okay we need to make sure that our start room actually closes at some point and ends start room not there so let's end it okay let's remove these quotes right there don't need them anymore and let's end our start room component let's hit save okay beautiful and then we'll say otherwise just do nothing okay so how we read this ternary operator is like this hey are we um hey is this a new room that's being created okay if it's start room being created then show the start room so show all of this stuff okay if it's a new room being created for example when we hit let's go then show this the potato uh room that we created okay so that's this new room otherwise do nothing that's really it okay and we got this question mark here so if the first thing is true then it'll show all of that otherwise it'll go through this secondary secondary um ternary operator that we added there okay beautiful so now our sheets are working as we hoped they would so that's a really good sign and now let's go ahead and build out our uh our sheet okay so I'm gonna go into our new room which is in which is a bottom sheet component that we're making and let's go ahead and build that out all the way now so instead of potatoes we're gonna make it much better than that let's end our jsx fragment here okay and let's go and I'm gonna go div all right and we'll give it a class name of sell that room detail container and again we're going to add all these stylings if we don't have them already within this div I'm going to have another div and I'm going to do a class name and we'll do style dot head and of course let's go like this um and then let's go and do do class name in here and we're again going to use bootstrap so let's go display Flex align items center now again all of this is going to start coming together once we start adding content inside of this okay so ahref I'm going to add here it's going to just be empty and uh let's go on click and we're going to say on click do this props dot set sheet visible and we're going to set it to false okay and uh let's also add an image in here okay and this image is going to be of the arrow that we have so let's go slash Images slash Arrow Dot PNG just like this all right so we got this crazy image uh Happening Here and let's add a class name which is going to allow us to style it later a style Arrow icon okay so so far completely out of control but it's all good we're going to um style it okay it's this Arrow right here we're going to we're going to make it look great that's good let's go underneath here and I'm gonna go span tag hallway all right and then underneath this hallway let's go ahead and create yet another div we're going to do outline file okay so this outline file is going to be this file right over here that's what we're going to add now what is it complaining about it says it's not defined okay not a problem so let's write this again but this time yeah I outline and let's do file I will hit enter it seems like it didn't import it so we'll just import it manually I'll go all the way to the top and import actually we did import it AI outline file so yeah I outline oh so it should be good start a room let's go there we go we have our hallway and we have that file at the bottom so that is good that's exactly what we were looking for and underneath here I'm going to add an image it's going to have a source of images so we got the image here for the user okay and of course we're gonna need to style this image too later so let's just keep it here for now all right now let's get to the fun stuff let's style this thing okay and we're gonna make it look juicy gonna make this thing look go great okay so let's go over to our room detail module CSS that we made okay and let's start styling this thing so we're going to have room detail container go height 100 on this thing background color we'll give it a clubhouse background color beautiful and margin let's go negative 1.5 em and we'll go negative one here so now it's looking good but still a lot of work to be done okay let's control that um Arrow very quickly we're going to do that in just a little bit so let's grab the container let's grab the head and in here I'm going to say display Flex let's go align items Center justify content space between okay and then of course we'll add some padding to this okay padding 0.8 Em by 0.5 like this so we had so things happen but our image is gone but don't worry we're going to bring all of these things back and make them look good so go in our head and the arrow icon that's inside of there and for our Arrow icon I'm going to give it a width of 15 pixels okay let's hit refresh beautiful so now our Arrow icon is probably there oh yeah it's actually right here so we got our error icon we got our image we got our file we got all of this stuff let's go transform rotate and we'll go 90 degrees and margin top negative 0.5 VM beautiful let's go and play with the profile image now so we can make the guy look better so let's go here all right now already it's starting to look great okay it controlled all those crazy images because they were just exploding everything let's give him a border radius of 0.8 em and then margin left 1.2 am beautiful and then I'm going to go ahead span font size one em okay margin left 0.5 em so we we gave a little spacing between this and give a little spacing between that and uh let's grab and control the font size of our SVG so font size let's go 1.4 am great okay let's so notice how this SVG becomes bigger now save and that is bigger okay so that hallway or sorry that file is like much bigger okay great so our styling is looking good let's make sure everything is looking good in our home JS okay home JS is looking good yeah all right other than that we got we got things looking spectacular and we made great progress here now let's go ahead and add body inside of our new room sheet meaning like we're gonna add more things inside of here so it doesn't look that boring right as you can see this looks much more interesting and this body will contain people and it will contain images and things like that so let's go ahead and work on that body now so I'm going to go back into my uh new room and in this new room JS let's go here pretty much um almost all the way to the end but just one level above it I'm going to add a div and let's give it a class name of go style dot detail room detail card and inside of here I'm going to have another div a class name of again we're going to go dflex on this which is just display flex and align item Center justify content between and then we'll go flex wrap like this okay very cool and then the next thing I want to add to this div is I want to add some styling so let's go here and let's add some padding padding of 0.5 em and by 1 AM now you might be wondering Causey why are you doing this with bootstrap and then why are you doing this like little line of styling here well we using this right just bootstrap gets us almost all the way there with the styling that we need to do and then I just need to add one more line so I'm not going to create it in a whole new file and try to maintain it it's fine just add some inline styling for it you're good okay nobody's gonna go crazy um so that's good okay let's go inside of this div now um and then I'm going to basically Now display those cards of the people that are actually in the room all right so let's go card dot members .map we'll go item so let's Loop through all the card members and uh here's what we are going to do okay let's have a div in here and within this div um I want to do I want to do a couple of things okay let's give it a class name because we're going to uh style this so style dot member container okay and then I'm gonna go hey it's Mike mute visible question mark um if it is visible so let's just complete this okay so I'm gonna go like that okay now it's complaining about something and let's see what it's complaining about it's probably complaining about so this is ending we're ending this we're opening and this should be closed with this all right so let's go ahead and do this so right now I'm basically saying hey if the mic mute visible is true then do nothing otherwise do nothing so obviously we're going to add um add things in here right now okay so for mic mute visible if it is true we're going to do the following I'm going to say show me a div give it a class name style dot audio icon and here I want to say mic mute fill so we're importing that at the top that's the one thing that we need okay mic mute fill is if I hit start a room hit let's go you can see when I go mute I can see this okay some mic mute fill okay so let's Head Start a room I'm gonna hit let's go all right so right now we're not seeing anything happening with the mic or anything like that but again we're gonna need to do a bunch of styling before we can see um really any of those things uh taking place so let's go down here I'm going to add an image and I'm going to do Images slash user image dot jpeg okay let's hit let's go and we have a person in the room okay our goal is to make it look like this so let's do that let's go down and I'll go P tag whoops we'll go on uh span and I'm just going to add a little asterisk here and then let's go down and I'm going to do item DOT first name because remember we're in the middle of the loop right this is where the loop is happening and we're in the middle of it so for however many people there are in our Json that's how many images it's going to show so for example I don't know if we had uh more members so let's go here and save then you see the second image is showing up right so let's go ahead and undo this so right now we just got one person showing actually let's show two people right so let's go Rafi qazi okay and then here we'll have Nas domansky all right great I'm sorry guys I just uh ate some hot sauce so if you hear me doing a little bit of slurping just please forgive me I'm trying my best to keep going here hey all right so we got this we got um this is this is all good okay this is all good start a room hit let's go we got this big ass faces in here and now we're going hey man we can't just keep having those big ass faces in there we have to um we have to you know style this because it's it's you know to be frank it's out of control so let's go to our roomdetail.module.css all right and we're gonna style this thing so let's go here and uh start adding in all right we're gonna go room detail card and I'm going to give it a background color so so far we don't really see that much happening okay no worries let's go padding or one em one em 3M and one M okay so we got some padding in there and I of course I want to control the images so let's control the images a little bit too so room detail card let's go image and I'll go with 70 pixels okay so let's see if that controls the images a little bit hit let's go so now the images are much more in control right and we have a background color of white that you can see there we got raphae we got Nas good good good good let's give each image a border radius of 1.7 em and let's continue styling this so I'm going to go border radius for the whole thing and I want to do 1.5 em 1.5 am and then let's go zero zero so now these Corners have they're nice and rounded and height I'm gonna go 90 VH so now it's 90 viewport height okay so now it's much bigger than when we started and let's go overflow Auto restart hit start room hit let's go beautiful so far so good let's continue styling this so we're going to style the H6 on this thing so let's go room detail card H6 uh we don't have an H6 yet not that I can remember but let's go ahead and style it anyway because we're probably gonna need this later so I'm going to add that in so font size 0.675 em okay let's give it a color of uh text color we will go font weight of 500 like this and then of course let's go margin bottom 0.3 em all right so we're going to see a lot of those changes taking place once we add an H6 okay right now we don't have them let's style our uh we'll style our H3 later as well if we ever needed a H3 for this let's style Our member container I think that's important so let's go member container like so and um I'm gonna go text the line Center okay let's refresh start room let's go we will go uh width of it is 70 pixels and Position will give it relative relative like that refresh hit let's go Okay cool so far it's looking good and now let's go remember container audio icon and I'm going to say position absolute and we'll go right negative five pixels bottom 36 okay so we're gonna make we're gonna make the icon show up that's our goal make the audio icon show up on the screen we're gonna give it a z index of five and let's go maybe give it a background color of background color of and let's just make it white for now with 25 pixels and height I'm gonna go 25 pixels okay let's hit refresh let's go this thing let's sometimes zooming out can actually help as well now to have that icon show up the mic icon what I'm going to do is uh let's just go ahead and set this to true and that will make sure that that shows up the whole time okay and then the then we can essentially just go on styling and make sure everything is looking looking um how we want it to look so let's keep styling our audio icon here all right so I'm going to give it a border radius of 50 so now it has those rounded Corners around it going to use uh display flex and I'm going to align items Center cool and then justify content let's go Center so everything is looking good and then I want to do box Shadow and add a little box Shadow to it so let's uh let's do that oh nice look at that that just made it pop out right it has that little nice gray backdrop to it and that makes it pop out just like how we want it so that's looking beautiful so far now let's go ahead and color that audio icon so I'm going to go here let's go audio icon and let's grab this VG and I'm going to give it a color of 2 8 e a e 6 1. so let's save save again refresh okay so now it has that like nice green color that we wanted it to have beautiful very clubhousey looking okay let's go member container I'm gonna go display Flex we're gonna go align item Center and this will be useful for the text stuff that we have so I'm gonna go font size one em and again if you're ever like hey I want the stylings to work sometimes just refresh okay and that'll show you um whether the styling is working or not okay cool and uh then uh this is again we're gonna need this later but I would just want to keep keep the styling here font wait 500 and then color let's go with okay awesome and uh next up let's style our span tag so I'm going to go member container and we'll grab span let's give it a font size of 2.5 em boom boom shakalaka we will give it a display inline block with I'm going to make it 14 pixels so let's just you know make it a little bit smaller we'll give it a height of 14 pixels beautiful border radius will be 50 let's give it a background color and I'm gonna go to 2886 ae61 okay so that gives it a little green and let's get it uh white color margin right and I will go 0.1 em beautiful so that margin from that little button that we gave it right gives it a little margin beautiful and line height of 0.8 and that's good oh look at that it's looking clean so all I had to do was just add a little line height there and it gives it that stylistic green color okay so we are uh we are all good with this component now the new room JS we have it doing what we wanted to do and now let's go ahead and add footer in our new room sheet okay so we're going to need a couple of images that we're going to need access to so let's go ahead and grab those images reveal all right so we're going to need access to our hand piece symbol and we're going to need access to our stop hand so both of these uh let's go public images I'm going to grab this drop it in images so both of those okay why do we need access to this well because you see here at the bottom leave quietly and then this raised hand here that's why okay and now time to make this footer work so let's go into our new room JS and we're going to add another one okay so we're going to do AI outline Plus why because if I look at my finished version I need this plus sign here okay and now I'm going to do another import that's going to give me this icon so these two are going to be images and then these two are going to be Imports so let's go ahead and grab we got mic mute fill let's go ahead and grab just the mic fill as well okay let's go down here and I'm going to do const we'll set a new state variable items visible and I'm going to go set items visible and we'll set default state to be true just like this okay and we'll go down here all right okay so we finish this here we got a div let's go underneath the second div and add it in go div class name and let's go style dot footer and I'll create button okay we'll go on click props dot set sheet visible false like this and that button will end and then inside of that button I'm going to add an image and that's going to be the hand piece image handpiece.jpg or actually is it PNG I think it's PNG yes it's a PNG boom son okay all right so it's this one oh not that one so we got the hand icon and then we have the hand piece dot PNG right there beautiful and underneath this button we're going to add another div and this div will have a button and this button will be a AI outline plus button that we already imported and that's it refresh let's go so I see the plus button and it's underneath the peace sign okay you should see it too but it's like hard to see it's like all the way at the freaking bottom all right so it should be there on your on yours uh too if you're following along so far let's go button underneath here and guys look if you're following along so far by the way I just want to say you're doing a phenomenal job keep going don't quit look what is this just a couple of hours and you have a fully finalized project on your portfolio that you can show it to your recruiter and at a job interview okay so don't quit keep on going and we're gonna finish this together so I'm going to add another button and inside of this button I'm going to add an image and it's going to be Images slash stophand icon dot PNG like this okay and then my button ends and underneath that let's add another button and I'll go on click uh give me the following set mic mute visible and basically just change its current value okay between toggling it on and off okay and this button is going to be a dynamic little button okay so let's go inside of our button here and I'm going to say mic mute visible if that's true then give me mic mute fill otherwise you can also give me just mic fill look at that when I click this button it toggles as on and off like this now I can remove that hardcoded true statement that I have here let's make that false so now when I refresh my app and I hit start room and I hit let's go it won't be muted muted by default but if I go down here and I see my mic and I click that mic notice that it gives me that muted uh styling that we did and even at the bottom you see that it gives us that muted styling right so that's freaking cool that's awesome beautiful all right so our job here is is good but we have to of course style the bottom because the bottom still you know is not the prettiest looking thing on the planet so let's go room detail module.css let's go footer display Flex okay so already it's starting to get in some type of control it's not as hideous anymore I'm just zooming in so you can see it clearer let's go align item Center justify content I'll go space between we'll go position absolute and again I'm going to do left zero and we'll do right zero and we'll do bottom zero okay beautiful let's give it a background color and make sure that that color is white okay start a room let's go nice okay great great great great great now let's give uh let's work with the footer buttons so style the buttons we'll give it a background color of okay so let's go ahead and do it all right so that color like does that make any changes to it at all what the heck okay well we'll just leave it at the color that it was then we'll give it a border of none so those ugly borders should go away it still looks pretty hideous so we'll we'll fix that in a second let's go to em all right so now it has somewhat of a border radius so it looks a little bit better um let's grab the images Now button images and I'm going to give it a width of 30 pixels so now those images are smaller and they also look much more high quality right because they're probably not the highest resolution things on the planet let's grab the button inside here and we will say display Flex on this we'll go align items Center so this will give us some vertical alignment we'll give it padding so the buttons have a little bit more uh meat in them just like this color we're going to give it that little green color that we always give things that's going to be the text color so you're not going to see that right this second and font wait I'm going to give it 500. okay so if you did want to see it we could go to new room JS and we can find this button that has the hand piece thing in it and we can add text in here so I can say leave quietly and hit save and boom you actually see leave quietly at the bottom just like that just like you would imagine and that looks great okay so our styling is coming together how we want it and we're very happy with it okay let's go down and let's go to div I'm going to do display Flex align items Center okay great let's go footer grab the div and we're going to get the button inside of it let's give it a line height of one width of 36 pixels so now they're all looking somewhat even we still have certain so like we still have these things too close to each other so I imagine we might want to give a little bit of margin let's look at our final product so it looks like there's a little bit of margin in these right where whereas in hours there really isn't that much margin in between those the other things I noticed is my hand icon here or image here is centered uh horizontally here it's not so I'm probably going to need to do that at some point so let's uh add a border radius first let's go border radius and we'll go 50 percent cool we're going to go display Flex okay the buttons are now like we going crazy everywhere so let's go align item Center this will vertically align them and then we'll go justify content and this will horizontally Center them okay vertically Center horizontally Center and now they're looking much better again we're still going to need to give a little bit of margin so we're going to do that now so let's go into the footer go into the div going to the button grab the first oh dib let's go div we'll go button and first child all right and inside of the first child I want to go font size 1.5 VM on this give me that 1.5 em and we'll go margin right 0.5 yeah let's refresh start our room let's go okay so now we got that margin showing up and now we want to add the margin to the second child because I said hey specifically give me the margin on this child here now we're going to add a margin to the right of our second child so how do we do that how do we do that it's very simple it's pretty much this exact same thing except of course we are not going to change the font size and instead of first child I'm going to say nth child and we'll just go to great we got it and then lastly let's go ahead and make the font size a little bit bigger because the plus sign looks really big the hand sign slapping sign looks big but the mic is much smaller compared to that so we're going to grab the third child and um not margin right but instead we're going to grab the font size and boom now the mic looks much much much bigger okay so we're done with the styling here we're having things show if I hit mute it makes the mute thing come up right my leave quietly actually works that was cool when I did leave quietly it leaves freaking amazing right so the functionality wise this app is coming along beautifully and we're almost at the Finish Line we just have a couple of more things to do all right now let's go ahead and add um add a Explorer page so what do I mean by that when I click here notice this explore page okay there's a lot of things happening here okay you got the follow button you got this card here you got a bunch of cards that show up here so we're gonna go ahead and add that functionality in as well okay so first things first let's install a couple of things so let's go yarn add again on your computer that might be npm install if you do not have yarn so let's go yarn add and we're going to do ant design like this we're gonna need this for some of our styling and then after this I'm going to do yarn add and okay I'm gonna need that as well so in terms of installing things that should take care of what we need okay leave quietly not quiet little um and we're going to add up we're going to add a couple of things here okay so let's go to app.js and here let's import explore from Pages slash Explorer now it's going to complain and it's going to be like hey I cannot resolve this Explorer component what the heck is going on well no worries that's because we have to go ahead and make our Explorer okay and we gotta we gotta add in the things that we need there so um one thing I want to do is actually uh get the data ready for explore so we can play with the data so let's go hit new file and I will go explore.json this is going to be the the dummy data that we're going to use okay so let's right click and let's reveal in finder and uh I mean you can't reveal in finder there's nothing for you okay but I have this for you you're gonna have to go and get it from the link in description of the video okay so let's go ahead and uh open this file not like this but I can open it like this great so paste all right so we got this is going to be the Demi data that we need all good we got access to it and let's Now work on our explorer.js page slash screen slash component so many terms in react so inside of source go inside of pages um and I'm going to hit new file and we're going to go explore.js just like this all right let's go import react from react import style from style explore module.css now it's going to complain hey that styling doesn't exist great let's go to style and let's make it explore.module dot CSS just like that and let's also go import down outlined fire outlined I'm gonna need these from ant design icons just like that okay why do we need that import well let's go here and we're going to need things like this like that fire icon okay and let's go import data from data slash explore Json cool now let's work on our explore component so I'm going to say export default function Explorer and we're gonna have people a con uh conversion conversation let's go conversation and I'm going to set this to data okay so I'm just unpacking people and conversations if I go to my Json I got people all right and I got another object called conversation so I am just uh unpacking this there's some other term in react I forget but in um python you call it uh Tuple unpacking but here um I forget the term as like a es6 thing that you can do okay really cool and let's go return and we're going to go div and I'm going to give it a class name of style Dot Explorer container and again we're going to style that later let's go and have an H6 here and we go people to follow just like that and then we're going to have div here and let's go style dot people container all right and inside of here we're going to do our people Loop so we have our people and we're going to go people map and let's grab a person or let's just do item okay and this is an implicit return statement that I'm doing and let's go within this div and let's do a couple of things so I'm going to go display Flex on this align items Center let's go within this div here add an image and we'll go let me just slash user image.jpg or as I like to say japeg and let's go add another div we'll give it a class name of margin left 2. okay thanks to bootstrap for helping us out here we'll send add an H5 go item dot title okay now there's a lot that we're doing here so let's go ahead and add this component somewhere we can so so we can at least start seeing it before we go ahead and add a bunch of more things otherwise it's kind of confusing so let's go to app.js we're importing our Explorer but now let's go ahead and add it so I'm going to go and in our home we're also not going to add explore just like that and we're going to add another route statement inside of our switch and let's just do this component regularly how we do all our other components I'm going to go component explore like this and we're going to go call it Explorer just like that okay let's hit refresh cool something weird happened so when I click it I see people to follow at the top and then I see a bunch of images okay so it's working somewhat when I click that image it at least takes me here let's go back and finish up all the styling for it that we started so in our explore page let's add a couple of more things and then we're gonna add The Styling so underneath this H5 let's add a P tag and I'm going to go and say item dot description like this okay again you won't really be able to see a lot of this stuff here okay there so at least so I commented out the image just so you could see all of this and you can see that I'm dynamically pulling all of this from that Json that I had okay right there let's go button we'll go follow okay so now that button is showing up that's good good all right that looks great now let's get out of here and we're going to add another button and this will give it a class name of style dot show more excited to show more people and we're gonna go down outlined boom all right so that's where we're getting that down arrow from right there okay so now I think we can um add in a bunch of uh styling so let's go to our Explorer module CSS explore whoops explore module.css and let's start working on our styling it's going to be quite a bit of styling here okay so let's go explore container add some padding let's add height 100 percent okay uh overflow Auto and let's do padding top 5.2 em okay so the padding is now showing up I'm going to add my images back okay so now after I did overflow Auto you saw that at least it allows me to scroll automatically Up and Down based on how much content we have on the screen now I want to definitely control the images here because they're a little ridiculous so let's go head image with 15 pixels let's just control it interesting that does not control it yet okay let's go uh position absolute left zero top 50 percent transform Translate Y negative 50 percent okay I said refresh okay so it's not doing all right so before actually we add this styling in right let's comment this out for now we're going to save this for later but let's go and add this show more people um card as well okay so let's go and style uh that so let me let me go to so or explore container we're adding some padding to it that made that made some change now let's style our people to follow so anything with an H6 okay so let's go explore a container I'm gonna go H6 on this thing and we'll go font size like that okay we'll go padding actually let's go um font weight 500 color beautiful and then margin 1.5 em okay so it gives it that little gray color right there now let's work on the show more so show more I'm gonna do display Flex okay we're gonna show more show more people it's a little hard to see but it's still uh still there okay and let's control the images as well so I'm going to do um Let's go people container image let's go with 40 pixels border radius 1.1 am okay so that controls the images so the images don't look freaking crazy now let's come to show more where we were working and let's add more uh more things to this okay so this show more people okay so for example if I do border none you'll see that the Border um The Border kind of vanished okay so those are some examples of what we can do to this but let's remove that for now let's go align items I'm going to go Center position absolute bottom I'm going to go negative 14 pixels on this thing okay so it moved it all the way down left 50 percent left oops okay and then we can do translate X probably negative 50 if we wanted to so let's go transform translate x negative 50 so this is one hack of how you can like Center align things let's give it a background color and I'm gonna go with an F4 F4 F4 okay and we're going to make that an important one so it overrides any other styling that this card has okay cool other things I want to do is border none and let's give it important so now that border is gone give it a color font color of this and I'm going to go important cool so again it's a little hard to see for you but it's there at the bottom okay so for you it should be there just chilling at the bottom a little hard to see okay like right there on my screen and box Shadow I'll give it zero pixels my bad it probably exploded your ears sorry about that okay so that adds a nice little box Shadow on this thing and what can we do to make sure we see it right so let's go show more people I'll go H2 dummy text all right so because we've done so dummy text is showing above that because we've done position absolute I believe right so that's why that's showing at the bottom otherwise it would show right here okay but because of position absolute it's making sure it's all the way at the bottom okay so I can change the the negative 14 PX okay I can bring that later just so you can see how it's being styled right now and then we can go font weight 500 and let's go important all right okay and let's go show more span and we'll go font size okay margin let's give it a little bit of margin for from the top so 0.4 em should be good beautiful and then of course let's give it some margin from the left 0.5 VM all right so now this button is starting to look much much much better right we've got some margin here we got some margin there all right so let's go down and um we're gonna add um we would do stuff with the header but let's go ahead and do that maybe um we could do that a little bit later or we could do a little bit of that now trying to think I think the header stuff let's do it just a little bit later okay for now let's just work on the people container that we have okay so I'll get started here so let's go people container and I'm going to give it a background color for that so that's highlighting to you where the people container is and where it starts and all of that let's give it a margin of negative 0.5 em beautiful we'll give it some padding cool and then make sure the position is relative okay and show more people is right there great okay if I added that little uh bottom negative 14 pixels at the bottom of that that would put the show more people right here okay beautiful that's because this is relative and if I remove this now it just vanishes okay so that's the trick we use we make the parent container relative and the child container absolute and so then it just stays within that all right so let's grab the people container again let's grab a div inside of it I'm going to do display Flex we'll align items Center so vertically align it we'll justify content space between so things are evenly spaced out so we got our text here we got the image here we got the follow button and let's give it a margin bottom beautiful let's go down let's go and add an H5 to this thing styling for H5 for the text color let's just make it the regular color that we use for Clubhouse okay let's refresh okay great so look at the font keep watching it let me uncomment it and boom the font size became a little bit smaller all the h5s became a little bit smaller and then let's give it a margin bottom of 0.2 em okay that looks good let's go here and let's get into the P tag so the P tag we're going to do a little bit of styling here so let's start off with the color first so I'm going to put this for color font size let's go 0.9 em okay so we're making the font size a little bit smaller again refresh if you don't see any differences let's remove any margin we have so again all of those come together a lot closer display I'm gonna do block and let's go with 173 pixels okay and I'll also do display uh webkit box height I want to do fit content okay let's hit refresh good line height and that goes ahead and just shrinks it a little bit okay that's why we add that line height there all right so what I want to do here is it's going on for four lines I want to make it so it only comes to two Okay so I'm gonna do webkit line clamp on this thing and let's go with the clamp of two let me hit refresh save okay interesting all right so now let's keep on styling this thing so I'm going to also um throw so this clamp is going to make sure that it's going to be um on two lines okay so you'll see what I mean in just a little bit let's also throw on a I'm gonna Orient this vertically let's go overflow hidden on this okay and I'm going to do text overflow ellipses so that's going to put the little dots if it can't read anymore and then last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to color it like that all right let's make sure we hit refresh and that's looking pretty good okay beautiful oops misspelled that let's spell it Orient like that save cool all right so Watch What Happens right if I remove the or that look what it does if I remove the Overflow hidden it will have this like overflow hashtag a Naj Cass whatever right so if I remove that overflow or if I add hoverflow hidden then it will take care of that if I take out the ellipses okay so let's go so ellipses will actually help the text if we ever have overflowing text it's just going to end it with the ellipses all right and then we're going to do people container let's go and add a button and in this button I'm going to say background color and let's go transparent on this button okay border I'm going to give it a solid okay let's give it a button background color so now this follow button is starting to get styled if I remove the transparent look how it has that like gray color and then as soon as I go transparent it gets the color of whatever is behind it okay let's give it a border radius of 2 em so now we got nice rounded Corners there let's give the font our color button background color okay so now it'll also have that blue that just bolds it up a little bit dope and then let's go padding 0.1 em and 1.2 am okay so now that padding makes it look really freaking cool okay and that button is looking kind of how we want it and now we want to have conversation cards okay we want to style them as well but we're going to do that next all right so let's add the conversation section in Explorer and that's going to be quite simple so I'm going to go to my Explorer and right underneath let's find where our H6 is at and right underneath this div ending here we're going to add another div actually let's not add another div okay what I'm going to do is let's start off with H6 and this is going to be find conversations let's go conversations about just like this okay I'm going to delete this and let's go ahead and actually paste it within this div right here okay let's put that inside of that div otherwise I was complaining okay so now you see this thing that says find conversations about blah blah blah okay so what we're going to be working on is this thing right there find conversations about and right underneath this let's go and put ellipsis like this right underneath this I'm going to have last name and I'm going to do row so this is like margin horizontal of zero okay and then within this div I'm going to get access to my conversations and loop through them like this okay and again we're just going to be returning an expression so let's go div and this div will have a class name of we'll go column six and margin bottom three cool actually no this is probably not what we want let's grab from here okay and I'm going to cut this all right and let's actually move that below this button right here so I'm going to go below this button and let's go underneath this div and I'm going to paste this here okay that way to find conversations about is going to happen here because otherwise it was really messy how it was happening there now let's go create another div and I'm going to give it a class name of style.conversation card and here we're going to have another H6 and I'll do fire outlined just like this hopefully we've imported that have we not imported that okay it goes we have not imported that so we will go and import that um oh actually maybe it's a line with the small L nope we still have not so let's go and do that fire outlined like this all right so far outlined is not defined refresh okay so we got our fire icon showing up that's a good sign and I'm going to do item dot title nice okay that's good and then let's go underneath this we'll add a P tag and we'll just go item give me the description of the item boom did I misspell a descript description so somehow the description is being added but it's somehow invisible okay item dot description let's add it there okay so we're gonna fix that in a second let's keep going for now oh I think it's because I actually misspelled description and I spelled it description like this so that's really where the error is happening from so it's yeah so everywhere all right let's do command um let's do command D and let's go actually wait why did it not select every single one of those command D huh that's interesting I don't know why it's not selecting all of them change all the currencies let's go description so now that'll fix that typo that I had we can change this with description and boom there we go okay so that is all good now let's go ahead and add the styling for this um component okay so let's go into our explore module.css and we will add The Styling for our conversation cards now so conversation card and I'm going to go and give it a background color of white okay we're gonna of course give it a border radius and I'll give it those nice rounded Corners good let's give it some padding okay and then let's give it a box shadow that looks pretty all right beautiful so this is looking really really good so far okay and again if you're enjoying this and you love this do consider our course uh profit with JavaScript because in that course we're gonna go way deeper because here you're following along with me you're learning this you're having fun you're building something that's actually really powerful but there are a couple of things where you're like how what are the basics behind this right so sometimes when we're building these clones we might not be able to go into deep down nittygritty of everything because otherwise this maybe five six hour long tutorial would actually be a 20 hour 40 hour long tutorial right so we take all of those Basics we put them inside of the program so then you yourself can build apps like this from scratch without having to necessarily follow along on this coding tutorial okay so if that's something that actually interests you and excites you then definitely click the link below and jump inside a profit with JavaScript okay this is the best community in the world of developers you get three coaching calls per week so the coaching calls are absolutely so valuable you have 20 plus hours of content around react JS all right so it's brilliant and you're going to be building tons of real world projects inside of that course okay so if you're enjoying this so far I would highly recommend to consider joining that course and I would love to see you you inside okay that's it that's it let's get back into this all right so um let me go ahead and do a couple of things here so I'm going to do conversation cards and let me grab the H6 okay and I'm going to set the color to our regular color that we have okay for the fonts and I'm going to give it a font size of one em okay so that made it just a little little bit bigger in this case let's give it a margin of zero okay so there's no margin that's why everything just squished up and we're gonna go display Flex beautiful okay so let's take out that line let's say display Flex everything is working nicely and we will do align items Center beautiful and now let's go grab the span tag inside of the H6 and I'm going to give it a little margin right and we will go 0.2 em beautiful let's um now grab the P tag in conversation let's take away any margin in there as well okay so now you see it's made it significantly smaller we're going to make the color maybe a little bit Gray let's give it a line height of 1.2 dope and then font size of 0.8 am nice that looks beautiful look at that so now our explore page is looking looking as good as it can be right this is a really solid looking explore page it looks juicy it makes you want to click on it and see what else is happening okay so great job on this and of course let's add our header as well okay so we're gonna add our header and our sub header so let's go to our Explorer and let's start with adding our header okay so we're going to need a couple of things um let's do import input oops input like this from Ant um ant d and outside of this let's start working on our header okay and we're going to add our header pretty much at the top so let's go div here and I'm going to go class name and this div here will be style.header okay and then inside of here I'm also going to have a sub header okay so I'm going to table that for now but we will add it later so I'm going to comment that out just for now there and then let's put our input that we got from anti the input component we go style of that input will be the following will have a background color of that so now our input is showing up and that's the background color okay if I remove that I mean looks pretty much the same to me so that's good uh do we need to be oh we out yeah Okay cool so we got our background color here let's go ahead and add a border radius 0.8 em oh duh so style is misspelled it's styled like this lowercase okay so now there we go we got our style going okay and I can see it now so that border radius is now coming through as well if I remove it okay boom and now let's add a couple of more things here so let's go padding and we're gonna go 0.3 Em by 1 em so now it's gonna become a little bit bigger like this I'm going to add border of none okay beautiful so now it's looking much cleaner and then we're gonna go box Shadow and we'll go none as well so let's hit save okay now it's it's there and it's doing what we want it to do great all right so now let's do a couple of more things uh what I want to do here is let's give it a size of large large input okay and then I'm going to give it a placeholder of find people and clubs so now that placeholder is right there and then let's give it a image whoops image tag weird let's go image source is equal to Images slash search dot PNG like this okay we're gonna close it and then let's go ahead and give it a width of 15 pixels like that and let's hit refresh okay great so we got our image up here and so so we're good to go right we got what we need we got what we came for and our search is showing up at the top good now can we make it look better yeah probably we can give it some styling and that should help us make it look better okay so let's go back to our my explore module CSS explore module CSS right and uh let's go add some stuff about a header okay so let's go header and I'm gonna go position absolute great we'll go left zero will go right zero and let's hit refresh okay great and let's go uh top zero cool so now boom all the way at the top let's give it a background color the clubhouse color great did I write that right f2f0e4 yeah I did all right let's give it a z index of five on this just so like we make sure it always stays on top it doesn't really go behind anything and I'm going to give it a padding of 0.5 em okay so that pushed it out a little bit from those top the top part because otherwise it was too close to it and one more thing to be to keep in mind why this is not showing the anti design and it's kind of just showing a random design is because we need to duh go inside of our index.js and actually import it um right here okay so we're going to do anti dist and D dot CSS so once we import this give it some time to load and hit refresh and now it's going to import that design and it looks much better than it did earlier now we're gonna work on the sub header component which is this one right here so that Explorer with the back button on the top so how do we add that well first of all we need to actually go and create a new component so I'm going to go inside of my components right right click here new file and we're going to go sub header .js like this and inside of here let's start off with a couple of things import react from react that we need import style from style slash explore.module.css okay we already have that file so we're good to go and let's just create the component for now let's make sure we spell this right sub header and I'm going to just give it a H2 actually let's go return and let's go H2 sub header like this and then let's go to our explore.js and make sure that we can actually read it and it says sub header is not defined so let's go sub header let's go like this okay sub header hit enter it'll Auto Import it at the top just like this and now we got our sub header being imported great now those go to our subheader component and we're going to start start creating this so open close parens because this is what we're going to be returning and we're going to do a couple of things so let's go ahead and do H3 and what I can do here is put the page title okay so I can kind of hard code the page title to like for example I can just say explore like this and it's going to just say that at the top but we want we would rather have it be passed in from right here from the subheader component right so like that's what we would want to preferably do so let's go ahead and do that now so this H3 instead I'm going to replace it with props.page title like this all right and I wanted to show me that now clearly that's not there as of now but I can actually give it that so I can give it page title equals something so let's just go page title like this equals and I'll go subheader boom or explore booms right there okay and oh it's called deconstructor right so for example we could use deconstruction over here instead of using props so like for example I could do page title because we know we're going to be receiving that and I could get rid of props if I wanted to right but props just makes it easier for us to deal with it we can give it like any number of arguments okay it's a little crash course for you now let's actually start styling this a little bit okay so let's add a div okay let's remove the whole thing for now let's add a div and I'm going to give it a class name of style dot head okay and we're going to create that style file or styling for that in a little bit I'm also going to create a link to the home page now you might see that there is a problem here oh I mean first of all let's obviously open close this in parens otherwise that code will be forever unreachable now we we still need to import link because it says link is not defined so let's go ahead and do that import I'm going to do import link let's go like this I'm going to need with router as well and Link from react router dump great okay now within this link I can make it anything I want okay so for example let's refresh this and this heee can be a link to a home page I click it it takes me to the home page I click here I go back to the explore page but instead of a he what I'm going to make it instead is I'll make it make it an image and we'll go Images slash arrow.png okay not so pretty so what I'll do is um I will try to go style it and make the image a little bit smaller right so for example we can go to explore.js I can grab my head and any images inside of it and we can give it a width of 15 pixels okay and now it's just there at the top so that's just to like kind of control that image so it doesn't explode on our face alright so that link is good now while we're still in this div we're going to do a couple of more things let's give it an H3 okay and we're going to do props.page title what we did earlier and now it will show us that explore at the top so that looks good to me actually it looks like this page is good let's hit explore again this looks good to me I don't we don't need this it's not being used so you know it's not a good practice so leave that in there and let's throw that out now let's go to and work on adding a profile page so for example when I click this it takes me to this profile page let's add that okay so I'm going to go to um let's see where should we start so let's just go to our app.js for now and in my app.js I'm going to do a couple of things we're going to get an error but that's okay so let's go import profile from Pages slash profile and I want to add the path here so I am able to route to it we'll do profile and of course I want to be able to route to that component so in my component I'm going to add profile now my app is going to complain I don't know what that component is or what that page is so let's go ahead in our source and we'll go and in our pages right click and we will hit create a new file and it'll be called profile dot JS and in here we will do everything we need to do to be able to see our profile okay let's go finish the styling for this Explorer okay so let's go to our explore module CSS for a second and um I'm going to go to head all right and we're going to text align it to Center so that takes the whole thing to the center let's add padding let's add position relative and we'll do margin bottom the things underneath it there's some margin there okay cool and then let's make sure that we play with the image and control it better so going to give it a position absolute okay so the image was the thing that was actually pushing the whole thing down now I've just said hey position absolute so it'll just be like Splat on top of anything and then I'm going to kind of position it right there so we can give it a left of zero pixels we can give it a top of 50 percent and then we can transform and Translate Y and we can do negative 50 like this okay and again that's a trick for centering okay so you could do this trick for centering things horizontally you could also use this trick to Center things vertically let's go here and we're going to go um we do we have an H3 here actually I think that's an H3 right what is Explorer yeah that's an H3 so we can grab that let's give it a margin of zero and then we will give it a maybe a smaller font size like 1.2 okay good so now I can see everything I can see explore I can see people to follow my left arrows there I can click into this okay that's looking good I am definitely happy uh I'm definitely happy about that and do we even need this H6 oh yeah yeah yeah we do we do for the people to follow okay fantastic good progress so far all right so our app is complaining right like for example if we go to the home page it works if I go to the explore page it works but if I go to the profile page when I click on that face it goes huh what what's happening well let's work on that okay so um look we uh let's go to our app.js right we imported profile but when I go inside of profile it's kind of empty right and there's not anything going on so let's go ahead and actually start working on our profile component so I'm going to go import react from react like this I'll go import explore style from style slash explorer.module.css whoops CSS okay and now I'll be able to access any styling within it by doing explorestyle Dot we name space it like that import style from there we go oh my all right style slash profile dot module.css okay now it's going to be like hey I attempted an import but it doesn't work all right and it's also complaining about this so what we need to do is actually create export default function and we're going to call it explore like this or no what am I doing is not explore profile and have it returned H2 it's going to say a profile like this and now it's going to give me a new error it's going to say something something about CSS and that's because it doesn't see where we got the profile.module.css it's like yo it's actually not there so let's go and add it profile dot module.css like so so now I've added it okay now it's not going to complain about that let's hit save let's hit refresh and bada bang bada boom we got something happening here so let's work on this component first before we do any type of styling so let's let's get ready to rumble all right so we'll go return and then in here let's add a blank jss jsx fragment like that and within this I will write my code so we'll have a div and I'm going to give it a styling of it says style.profile container okay and inside of here we'll go and have a class name here of Explorer style dot header okay it's going to borrow the styling that we made for our explore page that's what we're going to be using this for and um I think that's that one is good let's go and add another div and this div is going to be I can give a class name and what I'm going to do I'll give a style name using a template literal okay so basically what I'm going to do is I'm going to call it explore header but then attach bootstrap stuff to it so let's go ahead and do that so the so this one is going to be normal explore style dot head but then here's the template literal parts that comes in clutch so we're going to say text right margin bottom of zero nice little way of doing it there explore style is misspelled Here style all right let's hit refresh and we should be good to go okay so still an empty page but don't worry The Emptiness is about to end now we're going to throw in a link tag in this so when we throw that in and it gives us an error what we do is we need to go and import it so let's go import link from react router Dom okay now this link is uh going to link to maybe it allows us to go back to the home page okay so let's go to and I'm gonna say home just like that and inside of here I'll have my image and we'll go Images slash arrow.png so we got that little image if I click it takes me back to the home page that's all we got for the profile so far but hey it's pretty good you know why because it's not none it's not nothing I just hit command J and hit the command line and we're gonna do class name for this of Explorer style dot Arrow icon okay now this link is good that's all I wanted to do here let's create another div and we're going to give it a class name of style.action button okay and you might be wondering hey what's the point of this what are we going to do here well what we're going to do here is create all of these buttons right there okay so inside of this we're going to have our at sign okay so when we do that and it doesn't know what you're talking about what we need to actually do is go up at the top and import it so I'm going to go here and I'm going to say import BS at from react icons slash BS okay and now I got my little tiny at symbol okay if I zoomed in like a maniac it would be a big it'd be a little bit bigger now I also need my other things right I need uh my upload sign and I need my settings logo settings icon rather so let's go ahead and add those right so I'm going to go BS upload boom like this and then we're going to need um AI outline setting okay again it's complaining that it doesn't have those so let's give it them BS upload and that should be good and then we're also going to do import AI outline setting from react icons Dash AI like this and now we got all three of those icons now again as my eyes sees them as a designer I'm looking at oh I'll probably need to increase the font size in them and increase margin okay so as soon as I highlight that well that might be the perfect time to actually go to our module and just attack it right away so let's go get our action button right because this is inside of our action button let's attack the SVG which is what icons are they're svgs and I'm going to give it a font size of 2 em along with a margin right of one and all of a sudden these icons look much bigger right and they have a margin so that's really good it's really really good let's go back to our code that we were adding maybe we still need to add a couple more things like our image the username Harmony following things like that okay so let's go ahead and do that now let's go kind of um almost all the way down so count with me here this div this div this div and we will go right here and inside of here I'm going to add an image and this image will be of that user image that we had perfect and we'll give it a class name and again we're giving it a class name so then we can Target that class and style it okay so we're going to do that very very shortly but underneath this let's go ahead and give it an H4 and in this case I will just say rafikaze and right underneath that we'll add a P tag okay and we'll say clever cozy like this okay let's hit refresh boom great so that looks pretty good now again we just need to come into our styling and style up some of the stuff so let's go to profile module.css and I want to work on this image I want to grab this image and I want to style it so profile container grab the image in there with I'm going to give it a 80 pixel width a little hard to see and I'll give it a border radius of 2.2 em now the reason why that's all hard to see is because um the actual container I we didn't work on right so let's actually work on the container let's give it a height of a hundred percent and hit save great we will add overflow Auto to it and then we will add padding let's add padding top so we can give some some space from the top like that take the padding out and see padding when I add that padding now it's visible and we can see it and we'll also add padding all around so may so it's uh it's a little bit farther from the center and things like that okay let's take this padding and add it above padding top so let's add the padding first and then we'll do padding top 5 VM okay so sometimes in CSS yes the order can matter okay so that's why we're doing it like this now what I want to do is I want to grab the last child okay and I want to give it a certain I'm going to take away the margin so for example if you look at my last child here there's a margin right there we don't want that we want this gear sign to be right all the way to the right and these buttons will automatically follow so for example I got my gear here and these buttons but the gear is close to the edge of the screen so let's go ahead and make sure that that gear is to the edge of the screen how do we do that let's give it action let's grab our action button inside of it let's grab our SVG and let's grab the last child so the last SVG that we got let's go grab that great we're going to grab that and I'm going to give it a margin right of zero now don't go around grabbing random children okay that's not what this is about okay but in this case we can grab the last child and we should be uh legally okay to do so all right again hit refresh the disease of the browser will come to get you hit refresh and now it should be good beautiful okay what else do we need to work on here I want to work on some of my h4s but do we have h4s right now do we have h4s we don't so I think I'm going to hold off on that and um actually is my name in an H4 let's see yes it is so let's actually work on our H4 then so I'm going to grab that profile container and the H4 inside of it we'll go font size 1.5 em okay so let's make it a little bit smaller for color will give it the regular text color that we've been giving our stuff and then margin we're gonna go like this on the margin let's refresh okay beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful and um we will play with the p tags as well do we have P tags in here yes we do so let's play with the P tag here and I'm gonna go profile container and we will go font size 1.1 em oh font eyes that's interesting font size okay and I'm gonna make the color a little gray I had tons of A's in here let's hit refresh that refresh works like magic and let's take away any margins we have okay great great so this looks pretty good now we're going to add maybe a couple of more details to the profile page like the amount of followers add a bio at Twitter at Instagram things like that okay so let's go back to our profile page that we have and let's just add those things to this all right so let's go right underneath this P tag and I will create another div and we'll go class name go style dot follow all right we're gonna style that so for example all of this follow stuff here we're gonna style it in a specific way so that's why I'm just putting a class there so I can Target it and play with it later inside of this P tag let's have a span tag and we'll go zero and uh zero followers okay starting fresh starting fresh okay so you can see the zero followers and that right now is kind of the same thing but we'll we'll make that adjustment later can we do this hack because sometimes we can do this hack let's see all right yeah there we go that's cool right um the BR the code is so smart it understands what we wanted it to do okay so we can actually write it like that and it looks good zero followers all right let's add another P tag right underneath it and I will have another span tag what happened there span tag will go 51 and then we'll go space and we'll say following some zero followers and we got 51 people following Clubhouse our clubhouse is popping okay we're famous now let's go right underneath um this div here where it's ending and we're going to add a button and this button will say add a bio just like that and let's go underneath this and we'll go div I'm going to say class name and let's go margin bottom four on this thing and let's go inside of that div and I will add AI outline Twitter let's hit enter thank God for the first time in its life it decided to do an import now we got this Twitter icon right there and we will say add Twitter did that work hey that works that works that works now let's actually make this a button so what I'll do is let's wrap this up in a button okay so let's go button let's go underneath this just like that so we have add a bio button and then we have ADD Twitter button and I just want to make sure my margin button bottom on this button is zero so let's go class name margin bottom zero like that okay hit refresh cool as usual nothing happens um right underneath this button we are going to maybe add another button and that's going to be an Instagram one so let's just copy this instead paste it and uh we will say Instagram and let's say add Instagram okay and let's go right underneath this div right there all right and we'll add a class name and let's do style dot nominated will again get access to it afterwards let's throw in an image and again this is going to be an image of the user just like so right underneath the image let's add another div blank div and we'll go joined whoops okay and then this P tag we'll go this person joined um you know 14th of July 2021 14th of July is my birthday all right let's go 2020 so it's real because 14th of July has not happened yet and let's remove this for now and right underneath this P tag let's have another repeat tag and it's going to say nominated nominated by those span tag Anton Alarcon mixing names here all right so we got uh we got the image we got this now we're gonna style it we're gonna style it soon enough okay so just hold on there for me relax we're gonna style it very very soon let's go underneath this div right there and I'm going to say member oops let's go and say member member of all right and let's add a button and we'll give it a class name of style dot add member button and we're gonna do our plus sign for this one now it's like hey the plus is not defined what are you doing no worries BS plus and we're back in business okay so here's the situation right now I got my at my handle I got my followers I got a button for add a bio Twitter Instagram I got an image of who nominated me and then I can add as member of okay so so far so good but remember keep in mind this needs to go from looking like this which is kind of like crap to looking like this which is freaking beautiful Pixel Perfect okay kind of like my girlfriend so we're gonna make it look nice now let's go on from here to my uh profile Dot module.css and let's start playing with this okay so I'm gonna start with the follow first because the follow is uh not looking exactly how we want it so let's go profile container and Target that follow let's go display Flex on this bad boy cool so already it's getting in line we like that now let's go align items okay that didn't do anything let's refresh okay comment it out okay so we won't maybe add a line items Baseline and then let's try margin bottom let's see if that works all right that works that's good now you can just go and artificially give it a space as well or we can do it this way I can actually grab the first child in this okay so here here's a cool way of doing this so let's go to this one where it's a zero followers so where does it say that it says it right here right so for example I have this div right here now this div has um 2p tax okay now what I can do is I can actually get this div's first child so the first child would be this P tag and I can actually style it a certain way so that's something cool that I can do so let's go ahead and do that all right so let's go profile container and I'll go and Target the follow because it's this one right there and we're gonna get the first child of the P tags okay so let's go to the P tags and let's go to direct children I'll grab the first child and I'll say margin right of 2.5 em let's hit refresh and look at that right it added a margin right right after the zero follower right here so that's quite cool that's a good way of doing this okay so we're good on this end let's go and um Target our span and like change the font okay so font wait I'll start with and we'll go 500. we'll go color we'll give it like a darker black color which is the clubhouse text color origin right I'm going to go 0.2 em on this so there's some margin between the letters there and the words there and let's give it a font size of um and again I'm playing with the span here so let's give it a font size of 1.3 em like that save save refresh great so the font size of 0 and 51 is much bigger right so for example if I go um 3am and I hit save notice the 0 and 51 become big but the followers and following remain small and that's what we want that's what we want so we're happy okay great man my my front end skills are improving like crazy with you guys okay my frontend skills used to be absolute garbage now they're becoming so much better I'm excited thank you guys for being here with me doing this making me do this and build this for you I'm enjoying this just as much as you are so smash that like button if you haven't already subscribe to this channel if you want to keep seeing bills like this and if you want to boost me to make more builds do that right now and let's get back into it all right so let's go um grab our container and let's grab the Buns okay now the buttons are looking absolutely hideous whenever they look like this the first things I think of man I want to get rid of that background color man I want to get rid of the Border outlines right so let's go ahead and do that so I'm going to just stay border or not let's start there okay they're gone now they still have that lingering ugly color let's um so let's get rid of it let's go background color and we'll just go transparent let's hit save boom Blended straight into the background looks beautiful let's go down and um let's give the buttons a blue color all right the clubhouse color button background color like this okay now they look like they're clickable and then let's give some margin on the bottom all right let's go to em my bad margin bottom great now I don't like this image being that big all right so let's go and contain that image so let me go here and uh where's my image all right my image is under nominated so I can just go globally image or I can just grab this specific image so at a good you know uh good habits we're gonna grab the image like this and let's go with 15 pixels for now uh what happened there we go oh wow it's way too small that's what she said let's go 40 pixels all right that's good and we can also add a border radius to it if we want it to and uh that makes it better okay and then margin write it uh by this much okay so if there's anything we add to the right which we will it'll like make it look good now let's just play with nominated uh itself and let's turn the whole thing into Flex let's align uh to the center and then let's give you a margin button bottom of one em margin bottom so the member of got some breathing room from it okay and if I remove this margin right look the text becomes way too close that's not what we want want the image and the text just a little bit farther away from it so that's good now let's uh play with the p tags here a little bit so let's grab the P tag in nominated and I'll go 0.975 em and then I'm going to go line height 1.4 so let's refresh great so now it's like a little bit closer together right like this see and we'll grab the span as well now and just Bolden it up a tad bit so this ant on all our cones the name of the person looks a little bit special and now let's also make it black okay we'll go VAR text color boom Anton all our cone pops out has a little bit Bolder of a weight looks different from the rest of the things and uh now let's make this uh button look beautiful here the plus one looks weird we don't like it so we're going to go add member button that's how we're going to select it because it's right there add number button that's the class we were messing around with and we'll go background color and I'm going to give it light blue and I'm going to say important like overwrite anything else that's there don't worry about that let's give it a margin bottom of uh zero and again this is important stuff so great if there was anything below it it would put get pushed down let's give it a padding so we're gonna make it a bit we're going to make it bigger we'll also give it a border radius so it starts to look more like this okay probably one em you know because if you look at the border radius of this and this they look very similar right visually so sometimes just play around with it and like give it a 1em and see what happens and hit refresh and like look they look they're looking very similar all right and let's go line height we'll go we'll go uh with the line height of one so that like did that kind of like squish it together yes it did right because otherwise it's too elongated but the line height makes it Go smaller so if I went 0.5 em on this um 0.5 not em but just 0.5 let's just keep it one for now and then margin top I'm going to give it 0.3 em so they'll push it a little bit below versus member up so now it looks like a nice clickable button and this screen looks really good so if we go back we got this screen right here we have our explore screen looking good we have our profile looking good that's a really good sign we can start a room we can hit let's go like look at all this right this is freaking crazy I can mute and unmute I can leave the room quietly and then not Dimension I got my like user flow right so this is my home page I can hit get username I can go to my invite page right I can go to this page now next next allow like the whole flow I mean the whole thing is so freaking beautiful now you notice this little problem right that we had in the start so if I go like this and I hit get your username it takes me to this page that doesn't really exist so that's a problem so let's just go ahead and see how we would fix that so the first thing that comes to my mind is well what component is that I think that's the welcome component and I think the problem is that I have get username and it's taking me to this page when it probably should be taking me to the invite page so I'll just hit save I will go back refresh hit get your username and now boom I'm going to this page done hit next next allow boom problem solved so again debugging just get calm and then start like you know anytime you go run into errors just calm and then start to kind of go one thing at a time don't think of it all at once because then it seems intimidating and it seems scary go what's the one thing what are the things that I do know for a fact start there and then work your way through it okay beautiful so our uh explore our profile is looking great most of the things are looking good so we could have done a lot more with this and we can keep going and here's my challenge to you okay see if you could make these Pages do certain things so see if you could play around with them and add more functionality to them okay so I'll leave that challenge up to you here's what my finished version and product looks like right here's the upcoming for you this is what it looks like look at this nice and then I even have a bottom sheet that comes up at the bottom I can get out of here I can go to my activity and my activity notifications here looks so good right so I'm going to challenge you to see if you can do that okay but currently this is the functionality of the app that we have and we have a fullon user flow that I just showed right so if I go to my home page it brings me to here which looks so cool I can hit get your username I can type in my number next I can allow to get the notifications it brings me here I can start a room and it can alternate between those I can hit let's go the loader pops up I come to the room I can mute unmute I can leave quietly I can go to my profile page and I can go to the explore page and see what's popping and even like type things in and of course I almost forgot one last piece of the puzzle which is deploying this app on Firebase okay so that's gonna still be exciting so let's go ahead add to firebase.com and we will click um I'll just go to my kazia clever programmer email you can go to whichever one you want of course click go to console and uh we're going to create add a project I'm going to say Clubhouse clone hit enter I will say Do not enable analytics and we will simply make sure that we get through this screen okay so now Firebase project is getting ready all right I'm gonna open up my command line and in the meantime we're gonna have to do Firebase in net in just a second so make sure you have Firebase tools and Firebase downloaded so let's go ahead and do npm install Firebase okay so make sure you have that if you have it globally then great and make sure you also have uh Firebase itself Firebase tools so yarn add Firebase tools and you can do again you can do um npm install because you if just in case you might not have a yarn add okay so I just want to make sure that I have those things installed and then I'm good to go okay let's refresh and um we're done on the Firebase side we just needed to go ahead and initialize the project and we don't really need to do anything else now again the part of deploying is that you're going to be able to go to blah blah blah blah.com and you'll have your site up and running okay so that's the great thing about doing that so we're gonna now make sure that we have everything we need uh available and then we deploy it and there's just a couple of steps to being able to do this so let's go ahead and do this together carefully so I'm going to do fire base in it and let's see what it asks so it gives us multiple choices I'm just going to choose hosting because I just want to deploy this app online so I'm going to hit enter now let's do use an existing project okay hit enter and let's see I see Clubhouse clone right there I'm going to hit enter it says what do you want to use as your public directory now this is an important part okay what I want to use in the public directory is actually just a directory called build so make sure to write build important and now it's asking configure as a single page app I'm going to say yes so I wrote Y and hit enter this I'm going to leave default okay good I have my build folder but it's not completed okay so now what I want to want to do is I want to do npm run build and hit enter so now it's going to create this build folder with all of our assets and opt super optimized way so this build is ready to be deployed in the most optimized way a possible okay so everything that gets deployed is actually right inside of this folder so that's what it's working on right now and it's saying creating an optimized production build okay so that is super freaking exciting let's go and add some music in here to make sure that we're good to go on this and this freaking bangs all right so we got the uh the build is good now let's try doing deploy Firebase deploy crossing my fingers I hope it works let's see is it gonna work is it gonna work let's go hey all right now I'm gonna grab this URL let's open up a new tab hit enter yo our build is here how cool is that you guys how cool is that let's go back our build is looking great let's hit get your username it's right there let's type some random stuff in hit next allow who beautiful start around let's go loader boom I can mute and unmute I can leave quietly damn let's hit profile profile page takes me here nice all right let's go explore explore page looks beautiful and that is freaking awesome this is a phenomenal build you did a fantastic job if you got to here give yourselves a huge round of applause like that is absolutely amazing guys like this was such a sick freaking build okay and I'm so excited for you that you stuck around here you did this entire Clubhouse clone from scratch I mean just look at it you

you're gonna learn the science and everything behind how you think about building projects like these because it's cool to watch me build this you know and you saw me build this from scratch but like I want you to learn the science behind how did I sit by myself alone in a room and figure out how to build Clubhouse clone okay so like you will be able to build these real world projects that can do all of these things all by yourself okay and know the science behind it so you could do it from scratch when you're you know when you open up a file right and there's like nothing there and you're like oh what do I do now right and that's all you see how do you go from that to a finished product so profit with JavaScript shows you all of that so go out and take advantage of it you get an incredible community that supports you that is there every step of the way with you you have access to the slack Community as well so if you get stuck and you're like Hey how do I make this component and like how did you guys get it to line up like this perfect well no problem somebody will explain it to you if you're like hey this image you know I can't get it to overlay on this they'll show you the little trick that you can do with position absolute in the parent or position relative in the parent container and position absolute in the child right they'll show you those tricks and they'll

it's like a family okay you're gonna build some incredible projects inside of that um inside of that uh inside of this course you have some of the best instructors in the world okay and you have people Landing sixfigure Developer jobs all right I got a job offer for ninety thousand dollars Frank got a job offer for six figures um this guy got a job offer 410 000 I mean the results are crazy okay you can go ahead and check it out yourself and honestly join this course worst case scenario you have a money back guarantee okay so there's nothing for you to uh worry about so go ahead sign up for this course so you can actually build these clones yourself you can actually build these projects yourself and you're going to learn the fundamentals that you actually need and we're going to start from absolute scratch and what that means is we're gonna start from our command line okay so let's go ahead and clear out everything on my command line I'll make my screen just a little bit bigger here and um let's just go here and do a couple of things okay so I'm just gonna go into my GitHub folder you can go wherever you want okay and I'm gonna do npx create this is the important command for you to follow uh LinkedIn clone oh it's complaining what is it complaining about okay so let's go ahead in the start and let's try doing sudo npx let's see if it's a complaint about this no it's not okay so the complaint is that we need a new version all right new minor version available okay so they want us to install the new version so let's just take that command you might actually need to do this as well and now it's complaining so let's do sudo okay actually let's do this okay I'm just gonna do create react app okay for you npx probably works for me sometimes on this computer I have to do create react app for whatever reason and I'm just gonna do LinkedIn clone like so and let's hit enter and let's see what happens beautiful it's installing hopefully it's installing for you as well beautiful okay let's wait for it to finish all right great we have the entire app pretty much installed uh ready to get started could create react app adds in a lot of useful things that we need that's why this is important and once this is done we are actually ready to go ahead and get started now what I recommend we do is let's open up visual studio code okay and I'll bring that over here and inside of our Visual Studio code okay we're gonna do this okay I'm gonna open let's go I'm gonna go to my GitHub I'm gonna go to my banker projects here's my LinkedIn clone I'm just going to open that uh bad boy up and we're pretty much right at the start okay okay so let me open up my command line and let's go into our app.js this is what you should have okay now I'm gonna do yarn start and that will actually start my development server and let's go here and start it boom this is what we should be seeing right about now okay awesome one note for you by the way the if you're watching this um if when I do yarn start you can do npm start okay so for example if you don't have yarn just do npm start okay otherwise you'll have to install yarn and I'm pretty sure it's something like this and you can actually install yarn uh but you know if you don't want to get fancy just do npm start and you should be good I just um I just like to do yarn I'm just used to it now okay so your localhost 3000 is open uh you should be good to go now we're gonna do a couple of things we're going to delete unnecessary files okay so for example set up tests I don't really need it report this one logo SVG uh not gonna need that um not gonna need app.test JS so I'm holding command and I'm just clicking each one of these okay and now I'm just going to delete them so they're all gone okay next up what I'm going to do is actually pretty much every line inside of my index I'm going to just remove don't need it okay so let's just go like that and get rid of that okay cool so that's good good let's go to app CSS and uh inside of app CSS I also don't really want anything so I'm just going to hit command a to select everything and I'm going to hit delete okay and I'm going to hit save so now all of that should be gone as well and now in app.js now here's what's going to happen Okay so on the right hand side when I hit refresh you should see this error your error will be like something something something logo SVG complaining about it well it makes sense why it's complaining about it because you just removed the logo silly all right so now in our app.js we're gonna go and that import line at the top where we're look we're not importing the logo anymore so now we're just gonna go ahead and remove that line okay so I'm gonna delete that line right there and um also there's a bunch of stuff in this file that we don't need any anymore so for example everything inside of this div right here I can just get rid of and instead I'll just say let's build the Linked In clone like that okay and on the right hand side now it's complaining about report web vitals okay that's simple just go to index.js and remove this line there remove this line there where we're importing hit save wait for it to stop complaining and hey we're making some progress that's what you should be seeing right now okay so great job so far by the way okay beautiful so we got rid of all of the fancy styling or anything like that we wanna pretty much start this app as bare bone as humanly possible okay and kind of go from there so now what I'm gonna do is we're just going to kind of set like LinkedIn type of styling okay so first things first I'm actually going to take the LinkedIn image all right and again I'm going to drop these images for you guys in the link okay so you can grab the LinkedIn uh image from from this file here okay or you can just go online and find a LinkedIn image so I'm gonna go and um you know I'm gonna grab this LinkedIn image okay and what I'm going to do is I'm going to put it in my images public folder I'm going to create a new folder in here and I'm going to call this images so inside of your public create a new folder called images cool and inside of there I'm going to put my linkedin.png and again if you want to find the LinkedIn PNG very simple just go online type in LinkedIn PNG and you know again you can use the one I gave you or just find one from online okay all right so now what we're going to do is now that we have the image okay I'm gonna go inside of my um let's go inside of my index.html okay and that's also inside of public you have index.html and we're just going to make a couple of changes to that all right so where it says public underscore URL it says favicon uh blah blah blah we're gonna replace all of that and remove that and replace it with Images slash the image that we just added Linked In LinkedIn dot PNG okay and hit save now at the top of your app you should actually see the LinkedIn logo as your favicon okay do you see it beautiful okay nice and uh so that's good to go okay now we're gonna go down and uh let's go where do I want to add the rest of this okay so let's go ahead and see where it says Apple touch icon and here instead of this logo we're gonna replace this logo here with the same logo so let's do images slash LinkedIn dot PNG just like that okay great so we're making good progress so far and now let's go inside of our index uh index.css okay so that file is going to be inside of your Source directory so go inside of that okay index.css now we're going to add in a sum styling okay and this is going to be the common styling that we're going to be using for LinkedIn so I just decided to Splat all of that kind of in the start all right right we're going to start with making sure the Overflow Y is scroll okay so basically if we're scrolling up and down I want to see the scroll bar on the right hand side so that's what that's going to do and now I'm going to do overflow X and we're going to do hidden okay and what this is going to ensure also remember to put semicolons and also remember to keep hitting command s or Ctrl s and saving okay and overflow x hidden is what it's going to do is if we're scrolling horizontally we're not going to see any bars on the bottom okay that's what this is going to do cool and now let's just do a couple of things um to root to our body to our HTML we're going to add in a background color of the following F5 F5 F5 okay this is a white color the kind of color that kind of LinkedIn uses okay that's uh that's what this is going to do okay let's also add box sizing and I will just do border box here Order Box all right so that's good that's that makes it easier for us to like design our app okay and make sure that things fit kind of like how we want them to and it doesn't do anything weird Okay um next up we're gonna do a couple of things all right so now I'm gonna basically add some styling to things like H1 H2 blah blah I'm gonna just reset their styling so they behave in the way that I want them to okay so um let's grab our div let's grab H1 H2 h3h4h5 H6 so all basically H Tags I'm gonna also throw in header in there I'm gonna throw in HTML um this tag here I'll throw in an image tag let's throw in label these are all things that we're gonna need later okay my bullet points Li nav P tag let's throw in small tag as well span and unordered list okay that's it I promise okay I know it looks freaking crazy looks stupid but I promise that's it okay now we're gonna do a couple of things to it so margin we're gonna make it zero okay that's uh first things first so already you you saw your headline go above okay because I removed the margin so I'm resetting the settings on here uh padding I'm going to set to zero as well okay we're gonna go and set border to zero of all of theirs cool outline we'll just set it to none okay and then um font size I'll do 100 on these guys okay let's add throw in a vertical line on this bad boy and we'll do Baseline okay and background let's do transparent cool so you shouldn't see too many changes happening right now but what this is doing is setting us up for Success kind of like if your parents were investing into like a 401k or your college uh funds that we're setting you up for Success even though when you were born you had no idea what they were doing okay like that just buy me candy with that money okay what are you doing all right I hope you're making good progress so far okay now uh we're gonna do a couple of things guys so what I want to do now is first of all I want to focus myself okay good now what I'm going to do on top of that is uh let's start working on some of our components like our login component okay so login component is going to be our component after I sign out of the app so if I sign out it's going to be our logout login page okay so let's work on that so first things first I'm going to install a couple of things that I'm going to need okay so I'm going to need let me just open up another terminal thing here by hitting that button over there okay and um actually actually you know what I won't do that let me close that terminal just so you can see things clearly and um exit out of this and what I'm going to do is I'm going to do uh yarn add but you can also do npm install okay either one is fine I just like yarn better so whenever I do yarn add you do npm install yarn add npm install okay so I'm going to do yarn add uh react router Dom because I want to use react routers okay so that's the first thing that I need to install the second thing I'm gonna actually need to install is um style components because guess what we're going to be using style components in this beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful okay so we pretty much got what we're looking for all right we we got what we're looking for those are the two things we're looking to install and now we're going to go inside of our app.js okay um actually you know what let's build out our component first so let's go inside of our source let's add a new folder and it'll be called components like that inside of our components folder I'm going to create a new file and it'll be called login.js okay and in our login.js file we'll just start off with import style from styled components like so and then let's um add in the actual component okay so let's capitalize the name and uh we'll pass in any props that it needs and open that bad boy up okay and we'll just have it return a div that says login inside of it so pretty much not that much right now and of course let's export this so we have access to this component outside of this file into our other files capiche good so I'm going to hit save now let's go into our app.js file because what I want to happen is I want to take this component use it inside of my app.js file and then have that be displayed on my screen so now let's go to our app.js file well in order to use that file what do we need to do the first thing we need to do is starts with an i then it has an M import okay so let's go ahead and import uh login okay from um and we're going to do components slash login all right and another thing we need for this is we also want to start using our react router okay so let's go ahead and import all of the things we need for that so we're going to do browser router okay like so and we're gonna do as router okay comma switch um and let's do route okay so I'm I'm basically getting browser router switch and Route those are the three things I'm getting okay and where am I getting them from great question from react router Dom like that okay and uh that's it cool well now we actually gotta do our routing so I'm going to remove this H2 and I'm just going to start it off with router and I'm going to hit tab to auto complete that okay inside of that I got my switch okay and inside of my switch I'm going to have my route all right and this route is going to be an exact path all right and this exact path is just going to be the home page okay so let's hit refresh it's complaining about something what is it complaining about well let's see what is the error about said save okay did we do yarn start we did not do yarn start so of course that's complaining makes total sense boom now let's hit restart beautiful okay and now you're like hey I don't see anything on the screen there's nothing here well yes because inside of Route you still didn't add in the login component so let's add in the login component let's ah do that okay this is the component we imported we added it there and now you see login okay that's it so we're pretty much now set to go and start working more on like styling our login component and adding more things to it so let's just go ahead and start doing that now okay great job so far so now let's keep rocking and rolling okay we got basic login component functionality working okay now we're gonna add a container and we're gonna start adding some nav components and we're going to add some styling to this okay so let's go ahead and do that so I'm going to do a few things so first of all um I'm going to find this SVG right here okay I'm gonna put that inside of my images folder so I want you to actually find an SVG again it's going to be in the comments below or in the description below for you so don't worry about that I'm gonna put it right here in my images okay awesome so hopefully now you got it in your folder let's keep on rocking and rolling and guys you know if you want to know how to stop and start your servers control C control C stops it okay then you can install whatever module you need to install and then you can do npm start so just make sure your server is running otherwise your app is not going to show up here okay just a little note Okay cool so now let's keep going through this I'm going to go inside of my login component and uh we're gonna now start adding some styling and stuff here okay so uh just bear with me so first things first okay I'm gonna just remove this entire line right now don't need that and we're going to start with a return statement okay and let's create a container component okay and inside of our container component let's create our nav component and again hit tab okay and then inside of our nav I'm going to add a link tag okay and then this link tag is pretty much going to do nothing as of now and it's just going to be the LinkedIn SVG logo okay that's it so effectively what is this going to be it's going to be this thing right over here okay just so you know where we're headed and what we're doing that's what we're building okay so it's going to be a link and inside of this link all right we're going to add our image tag okay so notice the hierarchy container nav inside of there we have a link and inside of there we have our image tag okay IMG hit tab to auto complete um from my images folder I'm going to get my login logo.svg that gets me my SVG that I'm looking for and now look it's complaining it's like I don't know what container is or navis make sure to keep hitting command desk or control s to keep saving okay so now what this is complaining about is all that means is we actually need our container and nav style styling okay so let's go ahead and just style them not a big deal at all so first things first I'm going to hit cons container okay and I'm going to create style div and I'm going to put tilde tilde okay tilde is the key that's right above tab okay and just hit save so I'm going to leave this style component empty for now okay and then I'm gonna create a style component for my nav bar so I'm going to do const nav and I'm going to do styled dot nav and I'm going to do tilde tilde and save and stop right there okay so what am I doing here I'm giving it empty styling okay if I do that well you should now have a LinkedIn clone okay awesome okay so now I'm gonna start adding some styling okay and what that's going to allow me to do is it's gonna allow me to control that image because that image right now is just straight up out of control right because you don't want your LinkedIn to look that freaking massive so inside of here I'm just going to hit enter enter okay and then uh padding I'm going to give it zero pixel padding okay so on the container side I'm done for now and inside of my Nav Now I want to style this okay and this is where it gets like interesting what I need to do all right so let's go ahead and give it a Max width of uh 11 28 pixels let it refresh okay cool and then uh let's go ahead and give it margin Auto okay and I'm gonna give it a padding of 12 pixels by Zero by 16 pixels okay so now we saw a little bit of like padding kind of kick in so it's not completely touching the the top part right of our um of our browser because that didn't look great and now we're gonna actually use flex so to enable Flex you got to do display Flex okay now you might be wondering hey where did it go bring it back don't worry we're gonna bring it back really soon okay just hang in there for me align items this is going to allow us to align it centrally okay this is vertical alignment and then let's go ahead and do position relative okay and um I'm gonna do another thing I'm gonna do justify content and I'm going to do space between and I'll explain why I'm gonna do space between in just a second all right and uh let's give it a flex wrap of no rap I don't want this to wrap and go to new lines because for my browser right if I have this nav bar right here I don't want it to wrap and then go essentially to new lines that's not something that I want okay so this is looking good so far and then I think I just want to do a few more things to make sure that we're good to go okay I'm just gonna say hey anything that's you know inside of the a tag do a few things with it give it a width of 135 pixels so now this image has a specific width we controlled it right this is what we essentially wanted to do now let's go ahead down and I'm going to give it a height of 34 pixels cool okay and now what I want to do is Media query okay so this is something cool that I want you guys to learn and what I'm saying here okay is on a phone this line here all that means is on a phone do the following okay so I'm gonna open squiggly brackets I'm just going to say give it a padding of Zero by five pixels like that okay so if we're on a responsive mobile device it's just gonna look slightly different all right this is going to make a big impact later on so with that said with the currently with the nav bar and where we're trying to place our LinkedIn clone we are good now let me explain why we did space between remember how the final version should look well guess what guess how this is separated because of space between okay and guess why it doesn't run on new lines Why join now is not here and why sign in is not here because of flex no rap okay all these little things make a huge freaking difference okay and you can play around with it you can delete lines and like go back and forth and see if that actually does anything okay and that's another way to like pick up and get better at these skills okay so let's keep going and by the way if you're wondering why your code especially inside of the style components doesn't look like mine and it's looking like it's just one giant long string and it freaks you out um what I recommend is go to extensions and you can get vs code um just type in style components okay and you can get like one of the style components extensions that might actually help you I think it's called vs code styled components that one so you can get that one and I think that'll like give you the highlighting you're looking for and make your things look normal okay I have tons of extensions but that's um one of the ones that's really helpful all right cool so now let's go ahead and add the join now button in our app okay and that's going to be that beautiful button right there and it has a couple of features I want to show you when I hover over it it has the little gray color that happens also notice that it has a nice little border radius so we're gonna go ahead and build that now so let's go ahead and do that so first things first I'm gonna go inside of my login.js I'm already here so that's good and then underneath this image right here uh the the login logo so go underneath that okay that link tag as well and I'm just going to open up a div and inside of it I'm going to create a new component called join inside of that I'll just say join now okay now again you should be at this point where it's complaining join is not defined blah blah blah blah blah okay cool well not a big problem now all we have to do is actually just go ahead and create our join component so I'm just going to do const join and let's just get started okay and um styled a and leave it empty for now save okay so now at least you have join now up here on the top right okay so now let's start with the styling so go inside of it hit enter twice and let's go so let's choose font size and I I think I'm gonna go with font size 16 pixels on that one all right so now underneath the font size I'm going to add a padding of 10 pixels by 12 pixels on this thing okay so you can see it got pushed just a little bit from The Edge that's exactly what we're looking for uh text decoration um none because for my link tags I don't want them to have an underline so that is to just make sure that that happens and for color I'm gonna go with something like this okay just a not completely black it's a little bit grayish okay so that's what I want to do here um as a matter of fact actually what I can do is 0.08 okay so I think yeah let's leave it at this actually I'll 0.08 after hover okay so let's go here let's give it a margin right of 12 pixels great get giving it some more distance from the right hand side because we're going to put something else there and then let's go ahead and say that on Hover we want certain things to happen because right now it still doesn't have any hover functionality right so let's go ahead and do that so on Hover we're actually going to change the background color and um I'm gonna do this to the background color okay so what does that mean when I hover over it has a lighter gray right so it's kind of a dark gray join now when I hover over it it has a lighter gray behind it okay cool now I'm also going to change the font color on Hover okay and I'm probably gonna what I'm gonna do is I'm probably going to make it just a little bit darker so let's go here boom so the font color turns a little bit darker as you can see and then let's add text decoration of uh none okay and all of that is looking good so when I hover over okay no underlines no weird stuff happening and you know one last thing is that it's still looking pretty Square to me what I want to happen is I want to give it the little little rounded Corners so let's add some border radius to this thing so I'm going to go border radius and for Border radius I'm just going to say hey give me four pixel border radius on this thing okay so when I hover over I got a nice little rounded corners and the join now button is looking absolutely great okay amazing we're doing great so far guys if you guys are enjoying this video by the way so far smash that like button break that thing and of course subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and uh let's just keep on going so and the one thing I still want to do is uh to index I want to actually add to our index as CSS I just want to add some fonts okay so going to um our body right what I want to do is actually just want to add a font family here okay so let's go ahead and add uh to our body okay and we're gonna add a certain uh fonts okay and the only fonts I really want to add here is font family I just want to add Ariel Ariel like this and then I just want to add Sans serif okay fall back and so yeah now the fonts are looking good kind of what we're looking for and with that said let's just jump in to start working on our sign in component okay that's that thing right there so let's go ahead and do that so sign and component we're going to need a couple of things so let's go to our login component inside of our login component I'm going to make our signin component right underneath the join uh the join button okay but it's going to be in the same div okay so this is important to understand same div the join now component and right underneath it we're going to have sign in component okay hit tabs to auto complete that and then I'm just going to do sign in okay now again it's complaining hey cyanide is not defined so same thing here you guys know the rules let's create a styling for our sign in component okay and this is going to be a a tag AKA link tag and then let's just hit save cool so what you should see now is you should have sign in on your screen if you full screen it you should have sign in right there okay and now we're gonna go inside of this and start actually adding this thing so I'm going to add a little box Shadow to this and um you know I used a box Shadow generator that's what you can do as well but here you're just gonna get the final version so we got a little box Shadow around this thing so you see now a blue outline outside of your sign in all right we're going to give it a color of um a little bluish color for the sign in as well okay and for Border radius let's give it 24 pixels cool so now it's looking nice and round that's good okay I'm gonna give it a transition duration of 167 milliseconds okay so you're gonna see that's gonna come into play later on like for example when I hover over this it has a little nice transition that's happening there that takes 167 milliseconds it seems like just give it a font size of 16 pixels okay and I'm going to give it a font weight of 600 okay so now it's a little bit Bolder line height give it 40 pixel line height okay so now boom all of this stuff got pushed down just a little bit and um on top of this I'm gonna do a couple of more things to this let's give it a little padding I think okay so padding I'm thinking 10 pixels by 24 pixels like that okay so now signin component is looking a little bit funny it looks good here but on mobile mobile device it's freaking cut in half so it looks stupid so we're gonna fix that don't worry okay so that's our padding Now text align it um in Center okay and then we're gonna go back around color for it and background color is going to be a just that Okay so so far so good and then on Hover we're gonna give it some functionality okay on Hover I'm going to say that the background color is going to be let's go like that okay actually let's make it this one to 49 bye okay said refresh cool okay so now when I hover over it you see that there's a blue color that's happening okay and when I remove the transition look it just happens instantly so we don't want that effect I want that transition there because it allows me to make it blue but with a nice little transition on Hover and then on top of that I want the font color to change when I hover on it and I want it to be this blue uh right here on Hover okay so that's good and then of course text decoration even though right now it's good but let's just add this for safety and just good um you know default behaviors and patterns okay cool so our sign in on your computer should be looking good okay it's just because I was zoomed in like too much at 175 so when I meant here it looks good okay because I'm on a giant TV so I'm trying to zoom in but now you should be good okay so with that said our login component is looking pretty good now we're gonna start adding in our sections and putting in main content in there right now okay so now let's actually work on our section so in section basically it's going to be this big section over here okay so now we need to make that work at the image so it's also mobile responsive right because for example it's here like this but when I full screen it da completely different right boom and now it's here but when I go mobile the image is in the middle the text at the top how is that happening so we'll show you the magic behind the scenes Let's uh go to our login.js so we're here now right underneath the nav bar we're going to add our section that's going to be our new component all right all right so now of course it's going to complain and do our favorite complaint which is section is not defined okay so now it just means that we haven't had it added the styling part of this okay so let's go ahead and do that I'm going to create a section styling like this and it's going to be section okay save um cool so that's good now of course you know the drill enter enter inside of here and let's start adding what we want okay so first things first let's go align content and start whoops start okay now make sure let's also do display Flex because we're going to need that okay uh Min height I'm going to keep that at a 700 pixels for this thing okay and uh let's give it padding Bottom now some of the stuff you guys are not gonna see okay like for example padding bottom you're not gonna see it but what it's actually doing is if you added more content underneath this so like for example say section is like this right if I added something else underneath section it would start adding it from here but that's not what we want we want to give it a little padding so that padding that's what we're giving it right now okay so that's why some of the stuff is going to be invisible you can be like what the hell are you writing Kazi and why isn't it it's not doing anything but trust me it's actually adding padding that is good convention to do that okay uh conversely this is going to add padding to the top so just like this right now you saw it gave some breathing space between the nav bar and this section starting over here okay so cool we added pattern to the top and the bottom and now we'll do this all right cool so just giving it some additional padding now I'm going to make the position relative okay and um Flex wrap I'm going to actually do Wrap okay and the reason why I'm doing that is it this is the wrapping is what's allowing this image to get wrapped around which means when I do this it wraps it okay so that's what we want that means if the screen goes too small those things wrap and actually form new rows this is why Flex is so freaking helpful uh with we're gonna give a width of a hundred percent on this bad boy Max width is going to be 128 pixels okay align items because I want things to be in the center let's give it an align items of Center margin Auto okay and then of course last and pretty important thing is on media how do I want it to behave so meaning like on my phone on my iPhone how do I want it to behave this is how I want it to behave okay and let's give it a mid height mid height of zero pixels like this okay let's open full screen okay so now the section is in the middle you guys are going to start to see a lot of this Behavior once I start adding content to it okay it's going to start becoming a lot and a lot more clearer so now let's go ahead and start adding content to this thing and start adding stuff in our hero okay so let's go ahead and get our hero image so this is going to be our hero image that we're going to use right over here okay so we're going to put that inside of our images folder oh and just one fix right here guys um this is PX right there okay so just make sure you have that 768 pixels cool okay now let's go to our um I mean we're already here in our login component okay hopefully you're here now underneath our section we're going to add hero under um actually is going to be within our section okay so the hero is going to be within here okay so let's do this let's remove where we say section because that's not what we want anymore let's do hero as a component and hit Tab and uh just hit save so what it should look like is you should have section and hero should be inside of your section component okay now inside of your hero we're going to add an H1 and that's going to say welcome to your professional Community kind of like how it is on LinkedIn right it's save now again it's complaining hey hero is not defined well again that makes sense my friend because you know the deal we need to actually go ahead and uh make the style component for it so we're gonna do const hero style div okay do that and hit save so now we should have welcome to your porefessional community so let's um fix that welcome to your professional community great and let's just go here and start adding our width at a hundred percent why does it always autocomplete to that it's so silly okay and uh we're gonna style the H1 inside of here like the following okay so we're gonna give it a padding bottom of zero okay we'll give it a width of 55 Jesus so welcome to your professional Community that's what it should be looking like okay and that just happened because of the width that I gave it cool all right now we'll give it a font size of 56 pixels like so Big Font that's kind of cool like it actually looks powerful as soon as I did that and let's give it a color of 2977c9 okay so this is gonna be a light blue font weight let's give it a 200 font weight okay so not super thick and bold not Thicker Than a Snicker okay this is very LinkedIn e LinkedIn e vibe that we have here let's give it a line height of about 70 pixels okay great so that gives it some Breathing Room in between each line like so and um after line height let's add in a media query so we tell it how to behave on a mobile device okay so let's go Max with okay and this is a mobile device 768 pixels text a line on a mobile device should be Center so it should be vertically aligned okay let's go font size to be 20 pixels all right great and then let's go with to be a hundred percent rate and then let's go line height to be about two great okay so this is what it looks like on a normal screen and then this is what it should look like on a mobile screen right in the center fits nicely looks great just like you thanks for watching so far let's keep going all right so this is good now I want to get outside of this H1 okay and now let's style the image inside of here because we we want to add the image and we want to tell it how to um how to behave okay so let's go uh above all the way here we're inside of our hero we added the H1 let's also go ahead inside of this H1 and inside we're gonna add our image okay so let's go outside of this you know correction hit image and how to complete that and um I want to pull the image that we added okay and it's basically login Dash hero.svg okay so now you should have the image showing up man it's already looking pretty freaking nice okay just make sure you didn't do any misspelling so like look welcome to your professional Community is looking good but this image is looking way too big so we need to control it that's what we're gonna do let's go to the bottom and let's go inside of our image and we're gonna just control this freaking thing okay right now so first of all let's give it a z index of minus one and while we're doing that is so if a text is overlapping it it's always on top okay image should have this image should not have the most priority the text should have a higher priority than this okay now with let's go 700 pixels on the width cool uh just exploded but don't worry we're gonna control that so now on full screen notice we have made it already smaller okay before it was like even bigger than this okay for position we're going to do absolute okay and then uh bottom let's go negative two pixels okay look at that it's like in a weird position look at that boom right there right there okay don't worry we're gonna take care of that right now let's go negative 150 pixels uh right there cool and um it's kind of like watching a painter paint you know where it's like not making sense and then all of a sudden it kind of comes together and your brain is blown uh apart on a phone how I want it to behave is top give me uh 230 pixels okay and then with so like from the top right from the top make it drop that's a wet you know what I'm talking about so like for example if I change this like 50 pixels right it goes higher up but two 30 pixels is gives me that nice little touch that I'm looking for on a mobile device but don't worry right now it's like kind of invisible on a full screen so we'll will um fix that as well okay but let's just make sure it's good on the mobile device so with we're going to go with initial and then position we're going to go with the going to go with initial as well and I'm going to do the same thing for height and I'm going to go with initial okay so now on mobile device it is looking beautiful okay absolutely gorgeous so so far so good all right folks so one of the problems I'm running into right now is my image on full screen is going invisible but on Mobile screen it's there if that's happening with you actually comment out the Z index minus one line and now your image should be showing up okay and you should be good to go so let's keep on going ahead here and adding more functionality to our app so I want to add in the Google form component okay so I want to add in like the Google login so let's go ahead and get that Google logo okay so take that add it to your images okay awesome so now after adding that Google SVG let's go ahead and start adding that to our login okay so here's how we're gonna do it uh let's go right underneath um actually we can keep this inside of the hero section right because that's where we want it so inside of our hero I'm going to add a form okay so let's go ahead and add that form um actually this form I'll probably add it right outside of the hero okay I apologize for the confusion and throwing you all over the place let's add form here okay and we're going to work on the styling of this form and then inside of here I'm going to have another component called Google just like that okay and I'm going to throw in an image inside of the Google component and it's going to be my uh Google SVG component okay or not component I'm sorry the SVG file look at the image and um right underneath this let's go ahead and just say sign in with Google like so okay now again it's complaining okay form is undefined Google is not defined you guys know the drill let's create stylings for them that's what it's complaining about so I'm going to create a form and this is going to be a styled div all right I'm gonna leave it like this and then I'm going to create Google and this is going to be a styled button and I'm going to leave it like that refresh boom we got the sign in with Google form all the way at the bottom you should be seeing that right there let me make myself just a little bit smaller okay so you can see it okay now let's go full screen like so beautiful looking good so far and can be here and be good all right full screen and uh looks great now inside of our form let's start adding styling in here so let's start off by giving it a margin top of 100 pixels start there so that gave it a bunch of margin and that's really good okay because we definitely want to add some margin in there so that way nothing weird happens okay and also it gives it plenty plenty of spacing that we want all right cool so that's good the other thing I'm going to add to my form is I'm going to give it a width of 400 pixels 408 pixels okay and then let's go ahead and give it a media query whoops media query I'm going to say Max width of 768 pixels which means hey I'm on a mobile device buddy on a mobile device I want you to give it a smaller margin top so it's not a huge margin top okay so you see it now it's a little bit closer to our image which makes sense which makes sense okay now inside of our let me actually all right it's in our style button let's go ahead and now add um let's basically add styling to this okay so let's just start with display Flex so we have Flex box enabled on here and then inside of here we're going to justify content and this is going to allow us to horizontally Center things so let's Center that I'm going to add a background color to this and let's just do FFF okay which is going to be this bright white that you just saw happen right there okay and um align items so I want to I want to Center align this thing okay so that's now looking a lot better let's go ahead and give it a height of 56 pixels so 100 width let's give it a border radius to give it nice little rounded Corners beautiful and now I'm going to give it a box Shadow that's going to be a little bit complicated here but again you can Auto generate these uh from box Shadow generators okay but just bear with me here because it is going to be worth it because it will make it look great okay I can set pixels RGB okay and uh let's give it a zero percent here okay I'm gonna just save this and then let's do another inset there okay and um I think I'm gonna just make it let's go RGB here and zero zero zero slash zero percent okay so that's a mysterious looking thing but it gave it the Box shadow that we were looking for okay without it we just don't have that box Shadow so it's not the end of the world honestly whether you have that or not but you can add that in okay if you don't want to write all that out I won't blame you if you um if you avoid that cool so let's do vertical align and let's go middle okay and then I'm gonna give it a zero index of zero let's also start adding in the transition duration for this because I want it to have a nice little effect as I hover over it okay and if font size of 20 pixels so now sign in with Google is looking much bigger so great and then uh I think color let's color it like so so that makes it just that little bit grayish color that is looking great and then now let's add in Hover functionality on this thing guys because once we have that hover then it's gonna do things when we hover on it does that make sense okay let's go ahead and do that guys and let's keep the freaking energy alive and up in here so I'm glad that you guys are with me and rocking and rolling okay if you've been if you've made it with us so far smash the like button like look at how good this freaking thing looks right on your portfolio it's gonna look so great and it's just gonna make you stand out from so many of the other people out there so let's keep going so on Hover let's basically add a background color changing all right so let's do this uh let's give it a 207 207 another 207 and we're going to give it a 0.25 okay so now when I hover it has that little gray color showing up in the background okay all right so we gave it a little background color now let's go ahead and also add a font color for this okay and I'm gonna give it um this color right here 0.05 so when I hover over it makes the text a little bit darker okay that's a nice little touch and now again we're going to add a little Annoying box Shadow thing with honestly I'm just gonna skip because I hate for you guys to have to type it all out just looks annoying it's just annoying so this is uh great so far I think this is good and I think that um this looks great so far so let's keep going okay so next up um we're going to add a couple of more things to this okay so that should complete your basic form and to sign in with Google and let's basically add now some header functionality okay so I'm gonna go inside of my header and this header is going to be on the home page so what does that mean if I go to slash home okay I want to be able to get routed there so this is the completely built app okay this is the build version the final deployed version and when I sign in with Google right when I do slash home it should take me to this page so now we're gonna actually start working on this page and working on this header here as well so let's go ahead and get started with that so first things first inside of my let's make our header component and then we're going to make our home component or let's do the other way let's make the home component first so inside of components I'm going to make a new not folder new file and this is going to be home.js and I'm going to do import style from styled components here all right and then I'm going to create a component called home okay and then I'm going to return div and let's just do home like this okay perfect that's all good and let's just go ahead and Export default home so now this is a component we have access to in other areas now let's go ahead and create our header component okay so let's go inside of components new file header.js just like so and inside of our header JS we're going to do this pretty much a similar thing import style from style components and let's create our header component like that give it the argument of props and we'll return a div that just has a text header inside of it that's it for now and now inside of our app.js we're just going to import these okay so here's what that's going to look like so under login we have under login we have this route ending we'll create another route okay create another route and this is going to match the path of home like this and then inside of here we'll have header okay let's go header let's make sure that in our header component we export default header because that's why it couldn't auto complete it it seems like let's go back and now I'll go header and boom it will auto complete it and uh it we just imported header up there and uh let's also import home okay so I'm gonna do home like that and so I imported header from components header I imported home from components home we got header and home under the route call Path slash home so that means now I should be able to go slash home and it should take me to it so both of those components are showing and that's exactly what we wanted perfect so now you should be able to go to slash home see all of this stuff and let's keep rocking and rolling here okay so next up let's add in our containers you know how I like to do these things guys so let's go to our header file okay and inside of our header we're going to do a couple of things so you guys are going to need to keep up with me okay so let's go ahead and um add a container inside of the container let's add our content okay it's out of there let's add just text that says header for now okay so this is what it should look like for now and now we're going to add these style components right underneath here okay so I'm going to do container style div and let's leave it empty for now and let's do the same thing for content and we're going to style div and we're going to leave it empty for now okay let's hit refresh boom so so far this is what you should be seeing okay if I change this with boogie boogie hit save you should now see boogie boogie here okay cool now we're gonna start styling this stuff in here so let's add a background color and let's go White dope so it looks a little funny right now because it's just just bright white and it's almost like somebody was cleaning a really dusty board right that's what it looks like now let's add a border bottom one pixel let's make it solid and okay uh weird did not need that many parentheses so bugger off mite cool okay and uh now let's go ahead and add left zero okay and underneath this let's add some padding so we'll go uh Zero by 24 pixels just like that position I'm gonna go ahead and go fixed top give it zero and I'm just going to give it a crazy Z index because I want to make sure that that always stays on top okay and that's like never going away anywhere again a lot of this stuff is going to be invisible until you click into it like this and now you'll see this header okay I'm in inspect mode so just bear with me promise is going to get better let's give it a background color or actually no I'm sorry let's not do that let's give it let's do display Flex so now we have the flex mode enabled now let's go align items Center on this thing okay it'll Center align items let's go margin zero Auto and let's go Min height 100 percent okay hit save and let's go Max width of 128 pixels okay awesome now with this guys you're not gonna see much again this is to set us up for our next step where we're gonna now start adding the logo and the header okay and then you can actually start to see what this code was doing so let's go ahead and now add the logo so I'm going to grab the home logo and I'm going to add it in our images okay boom right there now let's go back to our header file and in our header file I'm going to now start by adding this image so let's go to the top and inside of content let's remove the word header we don't need that anymore let's add a component called logo inside of that let's add a link tag okay and um we're gonna say that this image should take us to the home page meaning that if I'm logged in if I hit that image right there you know it should take me essentially to the home page okay which is this page right here okay so now we're just gonna add the actual logo and the image so inside of this link tag let's add an image tag like so and this image tag is going to be slash Images slash home Dash logo dot SVG okay that's what we just added right here homelogo.svg now style components is going to complain it's going to say hey I don't see this component or The Styling for it no worries let's go ahead and add it my friend so I'm going to add a logo like this styled and I'm going to make it a span tag let's make it empty for now and let's do margin write eight pixels and then let's go ahead and do font size about zero pixels just like so let's hit refresh and tada all of that work that we had done earlier is now showing us what's going on okay so let's try removing these things and let's see if it makes a difference right so I removed container and look you cannot see anything right but now let me bring everything inside of container and now you can see it and now you can see why we gave it a color of white because now it's visually there okay so great work all right so now let's go ahead and add search and input and search icon so for example this search bar right here let's go ahead and add it and let's go ahead and uh get started on it right now boom so first things first we're gonna go ahead into our header file okay and uh in our header file we're gonna do a bunch of stuff okay along with like some stuff with SVG okay so what I'll try to do is I'll try to kind of um give you this SVG so you can have access to it as well okay so let's keep going I'm going to give you access to the SVG file too in a second but let's go ahead under our logo and under our logo what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a search component okay and let's hit search and I'm going to hit tab all right inside of my search component I'm going to create a new div inside of that div I'm going to create an input okay and I'm going to add a placeholder all right just like so now I'm going to go and create a new component called search icon let me actually go ahead and do that like this okay search icon will be inside of my search component so that makes sense all right now inside of my search icon I'm going to add my SVG uh logo slash path okay so I'm going to give you access to this as well but here it is all right if you guys need it again all of this is going to be Link in the description below so that way you guys have access to it okay so it's an SVG and then all we gotta do is uh we just have to close out of this SVG okay just like so so boom now again search is not defined search icon is not defined so we're just going to go ahead and create those okay so let's go ahead and let's do search first and then we're gonna do search icon so let's go search and um you guys know the drill I'm gonna go ahead and make it empty for now and let's go ahead and create styling for our search icon as well I'll go and uh do this okay so empty empty cool so we got our search icon right here we got our search bar right there um it is looking beautiful magnificent and we like it all right now all we have to do is start styling our search component all right so let's go ahead and style this thing okay so inside of our search I'm going to give it a opacity of one let's give it a flex grow of one as well okay and um I think I'm going to give it a position relative okay and then let's do the following for this div all right let's go Max with we'll go 280 pixels okay input I'm gonna go border none for the input so now notice that there's no border anymore so it already looks much cleaner uh box Shadow will go none and then background color eef3f8 okay that gives it a little light gray I'm gonna go border radius of two pixels cool okay that's gonna be the font color and width will go 218 pixels so now it's a little bit wider padding okay so great I'm gonna give it a line height of 1.75 okay so it became a little uh you know wider from the top got a little bit more height a hence height font weight let's give it 400. great font size we'll give it 14 pixels make sure every full screen it nice looks good looks really good height let's give it 34 pixels border color I'm going to give it a this color right here cool and then vertical align text top okay great so this thing is looking good now the search bar okay now let's work on the search icon so we have the style div that we started then let's go ahead and style that search icon component as well so we're gonna make the width 40 pixels for it position absolute Z index let's give it a one top 10 pixels so now it's getting inside of that search bar which is exactly what we want so that's good and we're doing that by using of course position absolute making sure that the Z index is making sure that it's not like hiding behind other things you know I don't know if I give it a z index of negative 200 it might hide behind other things right so Z index one just make sure hey don't hide don't be shy okay and then the position absolute just allows us to like position it okay now let's go border radius of that cool and then margin of zero great I don't want any box Shadow I mean I don't think I'm gonna even add that line okay I mean I could have pointer events none for this let's go and see yeah that's kind of cool okay so there's no um that's a nice little touch right because if I save now if I hover over it my mouse still looks like a pointer right but watch what happens when I go pointer events none when I hover over it the whole thing is a text box it's a nice little finesse that we decide to put in here for you and of course let's go display Flex so we have flex functionalities and flex superpowers and let's uh horizontally align that great now it's a little bit closer to the search bar okay look at it oh man that search bar is looking nice all right and then align items we're gonna align it to be Center and then of course let's add a transition background color and then have that transition be 0.15 seconds cool okay okay dokie okay I I mean I don't even think honestly we need that line you can kind of take that out and it still looks fine to me okay I like to just simplify it if we don't need something just take it out okay cool so search icon is looking good search is looking good yeah to me this is looking great okay you're making great progress so far I'm really proud of you now what we're going to do is we're going to actually turn that search icon into a file okay so I think that's going to be a lot better uh for you so let's go ahead and do that so I'll show you how to actually turn this into a file so inside of search icon what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this SVG right I'm going to cut it you need to cut it okay and um inside of my public images I'll create a new file and we're going to call it search Dash icon dot SVG just like so now inside of here I'm going to paste that SVG code okay so now notice that my search icon is not there anymore makes sense now what I'm going to do instead in my header I'm just going to replace all that SVG garbage code that I had I'm just going to replace that with this image and I'm just gonna go search icon.svg like so and tada we got that icon right there okay this is also highlights to you how you can actually turn that into a file all right has a nice little touch right there great now let's start adding things to our nav bar okay and we're going to start making progress on that all right so now let's style our nav bar okay and let's make it look pretty Pretty Ricky Ricky all right here we go so I'm gonna jump inside of my headers and uh we're gonna add nav okay and we're gonna add nav right underneath this search so give me a nav component just like this please and let's just go ahead and say nav menus now we're going to go ahead in our styling and we're just going to say const nav styled nav like this okay and we're going to go inside of here get a little margin left get a little bit of ah okay that's looking good display block beautiful got nav menus showing up on the top right hand side that looks good uh of course let's add in a media query for phones 768 pixels mobile devices in general and let's say hey if you're on mobile give me a fixed position on this nav and give me a left of zero bottom of zero background white and of course give me a width of a hundred percent okay so there we go beautiful that's what it looks like on a mobile device now okay Pretty Ricky Ricky okay cool full screen this thing so some of the nav menu items seems like they're now coming to the bottom which is fine okay we ain't got a problem with that right do you got a problem with that because I don't have a problem with that okay so you should neither all right let's keep rocking and rolling all right so we got the nav done now let's go ahead and add home to the nav menu so first things first let's grab our image okay let's take that image and I'm going to add the nav home image right there all right so this is our image now let's go inside of our header JS file and inside of our header JS we're going to do a couple of things so first things first let's actually wrap the nav actually not wrap the nav bar but inside of the nav bar I'm gonna what I'm gonna do is I'm going to delete where it says nav menus so delete that and instead I'm going to make a new component that says nav list wrap just like this I'm going to tab that and I'm going to hit enter and then I'm going to make another component inside it that's called NAB list hit tab then hit enter and inside of that let's make an a tag um and inside of that a tag actually here's what we'll do okay we don't need an ah ref for this okay we don't need that but we do need this thing tag wrapped up in an a tag so let's go here and inside of here let's add an image and for that image we're gonna go images with the nav home.svg like that okay that's the one that we put in our SVG file so what it should look like is you got your nav bar you got your nav list inside of that and you got your NAB uh I'm sorry not NAB list excuse me nav you have your nav list inside of there okay so that's looking good now it's complaining hey it's not defined okay no worries let's go ahead and Define this so let's go ahead and do first of all const nav list wrap okay and equal styled UL it's going to be an unordered list and let's leave it like this then let's go here and we're going to have our nav list and this is going to be a style bullet points uh okay here we go oh my bad let's put the tilde tilde at the end of it good good good good good good good so now all we see is this bullet point right here that's okay because that's what we expected okay um now we're gonna make it mean something in a second by doing our styling so inside of our nav list wrap let's go ahead and do this so display Flex inside of here we're going to flex wrap do normal wrap and then let's do list style type none okay let's open this up and now because we did list style none we don't have that little dot there um that we were getting so that's fine now inside of nav list let's start doing let's enable display Flex and align items let's make them centered okay and now let's make a a style our link tags and let's give it a little bit of a styling okay so first of all we're going to sell line items in the center background let's make it transparent I'm using Vim so you'll see a lot of jks happening there that's my shortcut for getting out of the mode and let's go Direction column and I'll show you why that's important uh later okay so column cool let's go font size 12 pixels font weight 400 okay just hang in with me there it's gonna make sense I promised my child I promise my child this is gonna make sense all right just hang in there for me pal Justified accountant it's going to be Center and long hot we're going to give it a 1.5 because why not okay and uh let's give it a Min height of 52 pixel enemy with of 80 pixels like so and uh position of relative okay and of course you know my style I do not like text decorations and the underlines that I sometimes normally get okay so none is gonna be far about me put that there okay and now just a couple of last things we're going to do let me just make sure that our nav list is right so we've got our nav list nav home dot SVG a nav list wrap we got our nav list inside of that we got our a tags great okay let's keep on rocking and rolling whoops okay okay my bad so this nav home is gonna be inside of images okay unlike me being an idiot that I am I put it not inside of images so of course I didn't have access to this okay here we go it's right there okay cool um so sorry there's tons of mysterious code and you're probably like what the hell's going on we don't need the cursor pointer we can get rid of that okay cool okay so now a lot of this is gonna make sense all right so you solve it and I took away a line item Center watch it became so huge and massive right that's what she said but when I take it away and I hit save it's gone all right also this is what the media query part is doing all right let me remove all these lines of code so you and I can be on the same page because I coded just a little bit ahead of you but now we're back so no worries um let me just close this paren here okay and we're just going to code this thing up together okay so hit save um and if I hit this now we can see this icon right there okay beautiful mystery solved now inside of this a tag let's go span and let's give it a little color all right and uh we're gonna give it this color okay so boom there we go that's good and where is this going to show up you might be asking here's where that's going to show up okay so inside of our let's go to our navless component now inside of our navless component you see that we have added this a tag well what we want to add inside of that a tank is not just an image but actually a span tag as well that says home okay so like that the a link contains an image and a span tag called home so now this is what it should be looking like we got home right there okay and when we go to phone screen right we got home at the bottom which is pretty freaking cool how the media query Works magically and makes that happen Okay uh media query makes that happen at the bottom right like for example if I change that to top it's gonna make that happen at the top but we don't want that at the top we want it at the bottom okay there we go cool so now let's style that span tag right but the color home now has that little like grayish color that you can see let's go display flex and uh let's align items of course Center okay so that's just going to make sure that the text is vertically aligned how we want it now let's get out of this span tag and we're going to add in a media query and I'm just going to say hey my Max width should be that which is meaning a mobile device or a tablet or something of that nature and let's give it a Min width of 70 pixels okay and then let's get out of let's get out of all of that and on Hover what I wanted to do is the following and on active here's also what I wanted to do okay the attack specifically to the a tag on Hover here's what I want to happen and specifically it is a span tag on hover or active inside of the a tag I wanted to get just a slight color change k all right now you can get lost in how it's nested it can get kind of weird but um it's a nice little touch okay watch this when I hover over this home Watch What Happens boom it's very very subtle it's a very subtle shift okay that's all that's happening there so just a side note if you're watching this video right now there's a lot of weird things that you can kind of get tripped up on especially how things are nested inside of one another so like be on the lookout for that and just be careful when you're going through this right because for example here right it's the on Hover and on it being active inside of the a tag and inside of the span tag that's inside of the a tag have this color happen Okay so sometimes you can get lost very quickly and easily so just be on the lookout for that alright so now let's add um nav menus like uh like the home menu that we added but we're gonna add all of the rest of them meaning I want to now add uh all of these ones here my network jobs messaging yada yada yada okay and so let's start working on that well for a couple of things we're gonna need need all these have items so we already did nav home so we don't need that anymore but we're gonna need nav jobs messaging Network notifications and work so I'm going to hold shift click here select all of these and drop them inside of my images all right now that it's inside of my images I'm simply going to go to the top of my file header JS file let's go to our nav list and all I'm going to do is I'm just going to keep on adding more nav list so for example here I'm going to select this nav list component and I'm going to do the following okay so this is just be careful on this as you're following me I'm going to hit like I'm going to copy this entire component okay copy the entire component and then all I'm going to do is just replicate it a couple of more times paste paste paste paste okay and how many icons are there let's go check one two three four five okay maybe six but I think it's five if I'm not mistaken okay it worked under your messenger jobs yeah so I think I'm fine pasting it five times um now let's go and start giving them those names so we have nav Dash home now this one is going to be nav Dash uh jobs I imagine actually nav Dash Network okay let's see what the first one is um in the completed version we have Network jobs okay so the next one is going to be jobs and then after jobs it's going to be nav Dash messaging and after nav Dash messaging is going to be nav Dash notifications like so now you can see on the mobile version so nice looks so good on a mobile device let me actually move my face a little bit out of here so you can see that like wow am I pretending to look down right wow that looks amazing okay so there you go that is beautiful and when I go full screen I see them all up there okay and now I want to change what it says so for example where it says um home leave that as is but the span tag inside of the nav Network well we're gonna go ahead and change that and we're gonna say my network okay we're gonna go to the jobs one and we're going to change that and we're going to change that to just jobs okay the one below that we're just going to change that to messaging and the one below that uh we're going to change that to Notifications okay so now on mobile device it is looking great and uh let's go full screen it's looking pretty freaking great that's exactly what we're looking for so our nav bar is now starting to look really really good that makes me really happy so let's continue going forward and now add the activation functionality to this entire thing okay so how I'm gonna do that is instead of nav list let's go where we have nav list and what I'm going to do is I'm gonna do something special okay and I'm just gonna do this to the home one none of the other ones for now okay I'm just gonna kind of hard coded inside of the home one and the functionality we're now adding is you see how this home one here is active right but these ones look like they're not active let's so we're going to add that styling to our app so let's go ahead and do that okay so nav flash uh nav list and to this nav list I'm going to add class name and I'm just going to call it active okay and simply all we're gonna do now is we're gonna go inside our nav list wrap okay so let's go inside to our nav list wrap right here okay and uh under our nav list wrap we're just going to add the stylings we're going to do DOT active so for active class do the following for the span tag and right after that we're gonna just do content blank whoops that's fun cool transform scale of X I don't know why it does that one oh key dokie and uh simply then border we're gonna give it a border bottom of two pixels solid and let's go white Dash FFF cool okay so we're working on this functionality uh bottom I'm gonna give it a zero ta uh left zero position absolute position a spell position okay give it a 200 millisecond ease in and out and I'll give it a border color of like this okay so now we have this going on here so now boom there we go I just had to hit refresh okay and there we go we got home it's going active when I hover over it that's exactly what we want and even on Mobile screen I can see home has that like nice little underline and um you know that's kind of what I expect to see on the on the home um you know the mobile app the mobile version of all of this all right so let's keep on going all right so now let's go ahead and add um add user nav menu and add work nav menu okay so we're gonna add a couple of more things so for example here we have a user menu and then here we have a work menu okay looking thing so let's go ahead and add those two as well so first things first we're gonna need the down icon that little tiny icon right there it's a little bit hard to see but it's that icon right there okay so we're gonna need that um the other thing actually you know what let's just throw that into the images first I'm gonna need that the other thing we're gonna need is the nav work menu so let's go nav Dash work boom I'm gonna need that um oh we already have that that's fine and then the other thing we're gonna need is a user SVG okay there we go there it is okay okay so now that you have all the images let's go inside of our header and start adding them okay so let's go ahead and create these components as well by the way so I'm gonna go all the way under nav list but if within navless rap so right under the nav list ending let's go ahead and add user component okay and then right underneath that we're going to add our work component okay so these are the two components we're going to have now within our user component let's go ahead and add a couple of things so I'm going to add a a tag but I don't need an ah ref for this either I just need to borrow the link tag style link and inside of this a tag I'm going to need an image and I'm going to use the user.svg okay like so um right underneath this a tag right underneath this image what I'm going to need is a span that's gonna just say me okay and right underneath that me I'm going to need another image and I'm gonna give it the drop down menu okay so far makes complete sense because you got the user image right underneath that you got the drop down image okay so that's looking good now we're good with this part let's go inside of the work part work work work work work work so now let's go and add a couple of things so let's go to a tag again we're probably not going to need any of the other things let's add an image inside of the work tag and we're gonna add in the work image okay nav dashwork.svg cool and also we want to add um a span tag inside of here and we'll give it we'll say work and within NetSpend tag okay we didn't NetSpend tag I'm going to add another image and uh we're gonna give it images down icon dot SVG like so okay cool now it's complaining hey user is not defined work is not defined hey no problem I like when work is not defined because that's how I live my life as a CEO let's go all right so we're gonna do create new styling for the component up and got my thoughts all right so there we go and now I'm basically going to add my style components okay that's all I'm going to do so I'm going to borrow my styling from our nav list okay that's how you can borrow styling from something else and uh for my work I'm going to borrow my styling from the user okay that's kind of nice let's just hit save for now um oh let's do Style with a small S I believe okay user is not defined okay fair enough fair enough we'll Define it there we go okay so on the mobile screen now you get this funny looking thing at the bottom right okay if you're not seeing it I'm just gonna move this here I'm gonna get this funny looking image the bottom right and if I go full screen you'll see me and you'll see work so that's cool but that looks ugly so we're gonna fix that okay so let's go here to user and do a couple of things and basically we're gonna say hey the SVG inside of this a tag look we got to do something with this thing all right it's it's uh just unacceptable so let's start off with width okay let's try to control the width of this link tag okay and then uh let's also try to control the Border uh radius okay fifty 50 50 can go 50 50 with okay let's see hopefully that does something if it doesn't do something um I got another idea in mind okay so another thing what we can do is uh let's go let's grab the image tag inside of here and give that a width of 50 24 pixels beautiful so now you see the image is actually quiet small all right so that's controlling the image that's good let's give it a height of 24 pixels all right cool cool cool and now let's give it a border radius of 50 that's going to add that nice little circular effect to it so you can already see it's starting to have the nice little circular effect that's great and let's go span tag and uh we're just going to align items in the center all right because that's just how we like to do things around here all right and now inside of my work All I'm gonna do because it's already borrowing tons of styling we're just going to give it a certain border okay give it a nice little nice little color so there it is and when I highlight it looks a certain way we got the drop down we got the me with the big fat Arrow this is pretty freaking cool looking great okay okay great work young Padawan so far we're looking good we're looking smooth we're looking clean so let's just keep on rocking and rolling through this thing okay now we're gonna add sign out functionality okay so let's go into um let's go inside of our user because that's where sign in functionality is going to be added so my user is right here okay let's go right down there right underneath the a tag ending and I'll add the sign out component okay now this component before we build it this is going to be this component right here when I hover over all right it gives me that sign out option that's what this component is going to be all right so that's what that component is going to look like okay so now let's go ahead and just build it out now inside of my sign out I want to add an a tag again I don't need the ah ref and um all I'm gonna have it do is say sign out and again I'm just adding the attack to borrow the styling that I have added to it okay so hit save let's go down and let's create our styled component for sign out const sign out okay and we're just gonna do styled div let's leave it empty for now and let's go inside of here let's uh let's go back let's hit refresh cool okay so we have something showing up that's a good sign now instead of inside of our sign out we're gonna let's uh go ahead and do position absolute let's go top by 45 pixels okay and I'm going to pass on the drop shadow because again it's one of those like weird looking ones so I'm just gonna keep it simple here so sign out creates a little box around so give it a white background and now let's give it a border radius of this okay so now outside now it has a little border radius around it right there that you can see that looks cool and under here I'll give it a width of 100 pixels okay and a height of 40 pixels okay so now the sign out is starting to get under control and not looking as crazy give it a font size of 16 pixels and transition duration this is going to give it that little effect when it comes up which it's not going to do right now but in a second we will add that so then it'll look much nicer text align and let's align it in the center display none that looks good okay so it won't display anything and then it'll come up on Hover okay so now let's go inside of our user which borrows from our style component uh navless component so inside of user we're going to create a new thing and we're basically going to say on Hover do the following for the user all right now we're going to select use this fancy selector to select our sign out component okay and style it align item Center okay and I'm going to justify content inside of the center all right now we're having reference error so what's going on here cannot access sign out before initialization interesting so what we need to do is um we need to move this code up I believe let's take the sign out code and um move it up up above user okay let's move it right there and uh we should be good nice we are good okay because yeah I couldn't reference sign out because it wasn't defined yet defined yet so we just make sure we defined it right before okay so let's go back now when I hover over me you can actually see this drop down of sign out showing up that's a really good sign that's what you should be seeing right now okay dope so looking good so far now let's keep on going with this thing okay so we're now going to add a container and I'm gonna basically add another component using style components okay so let's go with that and we're gonna add the hiring in a hurry part which looks like this ad right here right there all right that gives it also a linkedinesque feeling we're gonna go ahead and add that now cool so let's go inside of Home JS all right and we're gonna add that here so um we're gonna be doing a lot of stuff so inside of this return okay let's just open this return uh create a container component inside its container component create a section component and then let's create an H5 and again let's create an a tag but uh um without the ahrefs okay like so just to borrow the styling and then basically what I'm gonna do is um just type in hiring in a hurry question mark all right and uh just like that okay and then underneath this H5 I'm going to make a P tag and um basically I'm just gonna say find talented Pros in record time with upwork and keep business moving and put a period there save okay so I have a section inside of which I have an H5 and a paragraph tag cool now let's go ahead and just style this and a lot of these are very common stylings that we have already kind of done so I'm gonna like go through this much faster so our container is going to be I'm going to just keep it empty for now and start off with that I'll have my content is going to be styled div we'll keep it empty for now we'll have section and um I think I'm going to make that section okay style section and again we'll keep it empty for now so it doesn't complain and uh there you go okay so now we have that text but you saw it was a little hard to see right it's kind of up here hiding okay and we basically need to push it down that's what we're gonna do right now we're gonna push it down so inside of my container I will go ahead and do give some padding to the top 52 pixels so now boom it just pushed it down and now I can finally see it let's give it a Max width of 100 percent so okay cool and then um what I'm gonna do inside of content uh let's give it a Max width of 128. this okay let's go down and I'm gonna do margin left Auto and also we're going to give it in margin right um and we're gonna do Auto okay cool and uh inside of section um let's do mid height 50. all right so let's give it that 50 pixels let's give it a padding of 16 pixels a box sizing let's do content box on this cool okay so that just centered Center aligned it all right now it's perfectly smack in the middle of the center uh let's give it a text decoration and we will actually give it an underline okay kind of like an actual link will enable Flex on this and justify content to be in Center okay there we go okay so we'll do media queries here in just a second don't worry for H5 I'm going to give it a special um styling let's go ahead and do this okay give it a little blue for hiring in a hurry that's that right there okay and the a tag inside of here um let's give it a 700 beautiful okay let's get in outside of the H5 tag now and uh let's go in to the P tag and style that and I'm gonna say hey give me 14. font size 14. and let's also now do some coloring on this thank you okay great gives me makes it a little bit darker and uh Let's uh make the text Bolder right so 600 makes it pretty bold and then let's get outside of the P tag and finally let's give it a media query so I'm gonna go Max with 768 again mobile devices were you at mobile devices Flex direction we're going to give a column and then padding of course will be Zero by five pixels okay boom there we have it that is looking gorgeous okay beautiful hopefully you got to that with me and let's keep rocking and rolling all right just to blow some of your uh some of yours mines okay so to flex on what this media query does right so for example imagine if I wanted to make this red every time it was in mobile device but like if I went full screen uh it made it um it made it black okay so what I can do is I can actually select because this is a P tag right here so I can actually select this by doing that okay and then how would I make it red think about that how would I make it red all right so color red save okay so now notice that it's in red but when I go full screen mode desktop mode now it's black okay so it's basically saying this again is saying mobile devices do the following now I can also you know if I wanted to do something like font size make the font size 100 x on mobile the font size would be crazy in red and on full screen it would actually be completely normal that's kind of crazy it's almost like you have two different apps right that's pretty freaking cool so um I'm just going to select this P tag and remove it and we should be back to our normal uh healthy looking app all right now what we're going to do is basically we're gonna start to add some of these parts so for example in the finished version you see we have um we have these three things happening over here okay so this is like one this is two and this is three and this is our left side right this is our middle and then this is our right side okay so basically what I'm going to do at this point is I'm going to divide up the page in these three things and I'm gonna use actually grid layout instead of flexbox layout to do this okay so this is going to be really cool let's go ahead and make it happen pal okay so let me go to our our app cool let's go to home.js okay cool we're already here all right so let's go to um let's go right underneath section and right underneath section I'm going to add my component called layout and inside of here I'm going to make a div and call it left side here this is gonna I'm gonna put Main and another div and we'll just say right side okay and again it's complaining I don't know what layout is but this time you know what we need to do okay what do we need to do we need to go downtown and style that damn component const layout style div all right save and then let's go here okay so right now you got left side Main and right side not exactly where we want it but it's a good start and uh here's what we're going to do I'm going to start with display grid okay well that didn't do anything it's okay buddy hold on hang in there all right we're gonna call them the the areas we're gonna call them this left side Main and right side okay boom so it's divided up into three areas all right so now what I want to do is I want to Define how many columns I want right so we're gonna go ahead and do that now so let's go here uh and I'm going to give it columns and I'm just going to say min max give me this okay right there let's go okay and always like click and watch what it does right so right now it's doing something really really bizarre but watch what happens once we're done with the whole freaking thing okay I don't know why I'm an autocomplete always acts so freaking weird okay let's go here min max 300 pixels okay so let's go here um min max zero five okay there we go so now they're like overlapping a little bit but we got left side Main and right side kind of like how I want them but uh a couple of things I want to tell them I want to tell them hey I want to have a column gap of 25 pixels okay cool and um another thing I want is I want a row Gap of 25 pixels okay just make sure we keep refreshing because sometimes The Styling acts a little weird and uh grid template row let's go Auto on this thing cool okay and uh margin I'm gonna go 25 pixels cool so that gave it some margin from the top great and then let's go ahead and again add our media query so what does that mean that means that uh mobile device we want specific things to happen okay display Flex all right Flex direction we're going to make it go column instead of like row by row right so for example here it's going to go like multiple columns okay uh when I go into this now it's like that each row is a column okay just one column per row and um padding we're gonna go zero by five pixels like that cool so we gave it a little push and a shove from touching the screen so much on the left hand side okay and uh with that said we're looking pretty good and that allowed us to divide up the page into three and you know honestly I'm just gonna comment that line out because that line is giving me the creeps with that said this is looking good and let's keep on rocking and rolling okay so so far looking good um now let's actually go ahead and we've divided the page now we're actually going to start making the main and the left and the right components okay so let's go ahead and start doing that uh we're gonna try to keep it pretty freaking simple and pretty pretty um empty for now okay so let's go ahead go inside of components and create a new file and we're going to call this file left side.js um and in left side JS create another component okay called uh inside of components call it main.js and let's also create another component and we'll call it right side.js okay then inside of uh left side just go ahead and do import styled from styled components okay and uh for left side we're going to do the following all right so let's fix this one because we made a little uh typo so just rename and all I'm just make it a small s okay there we go so uh complete const left side I'm gonna have props like this okay and uh return inside of the return we're just gonna put a container in that container just say the word left side like that that's fine okay and we're going to create the style component for this so it doesn't freak out and inside of here we'll do grid area and we'll go left side just like that okay and again export default of sight cool so save save save save save save now we're going to do this let's go to main and um in main I'm gonna paste that code and everywhere it says left side I'm just going to replace it with main that's it okay whoops so let's replace this with Main okay and let's replace that with main cool and this like that so wherever it says main replace it um and now copy main go to right side paste this code and everywhere it says main you know the drill by this point uh just replace right side replace main with right side okay like that okay and then just go hit save um cool and last thing we want to do is we want to go to home.js okay and under layout we want to replace all of these divs and remove them because we don't need that anymore instead we're just gonna do left side all right and make sure you auto complete it because autocomplete will automatically import it for you as well uh why did it do left side like that oh because um um okay well anyways it's it's left side with the small s like that okay we're also going to do Main just like that close it and then we're also going to do right side make sure that when you write these three that you import these three as well um and now it's saying styled is not defined in any of them well what does that mean so let's go to left side and let's see what it's saying okay so lowercase the style from style components and that should be good to go I believe save go here make it styled with a small s save hit refresh and um yep that's looking great let's hit save like that cool so we're good so far and now let's actually add a art card component on the left hand side all right so let's add the art to the cards now so let's go ahead and do this okay so first things first I'm gonna go to uh let's go to left side because that's where we're gonna actually make this happen and I'm going to create um let's create a style component and I'm going to um which are called Art card okay and let's actually get it started with something in here so instead of saying left side in there I'm going to do art card just like that all right and um within this I'm just gonna say card okay kind of like that so you should have card here okay now inside of this we'll do text align and I'll do Center okay so boom there we go looking good so far foreign now let's go overflow hidden all right so it won't like bleed off the screen onto the sides okay there we go and um let's go background color Boom Like This give it a border radius of 5 pixels cool so now we're starting to look like a card right um and we have that background right there and now the the little radius is coming in that's clean and uh let's give it a little transition box Shadow 83 milliseconds okay cool and now let's give it a position relative border I'm gonna give it none okay and um I can give it a complicated looking box shadow but I think I'm just gonna pass on that for now so I'm actually gonna add the Box uh Shadow because I think it does make it kind of look nice and so let's go ahead and do that okay I'm gonna give it a um the only reason sometimes I want to skip it is because it looks like this mysterious code but again a lot of it is autogenerated um you know and even when you should I encourage you to use like online tools for things like box Shadow and stuff like that okay all right so now we got the art card let's go ahead and work on the user information so we're gonna need a couple of things to make that happen all right so now you're gonna need two photos slash SVG files we're gonna need photo this one right here with the camera icon and we're also going to need this card uh background card okay so let's go ahead and take both of these and I'm going to um put them in my yoink okay just there's a place uh right before a pit stop before I drop them into my images so boom just added them right there all right so now that we added those images uh let's go ahead and do something with them so I'm gonna um am I in the left side already okay great I'm in the left side component already perfect now uh inside of my art card just so you have an idea what we're doing we're gonna be building this thing out right here on the left hand side okay so let's go inside of our app that we're working on currently inside of our art card component remove where it says cart instead we're going to create a new component called user info all right I'm gonna hit tab on this and inside of here I'm going to create a new component called background let's say tab on that that should complete it and inside of this um actually let's uh kill the card background right there okay and so inside of user info I'm gonna have card background I'm also going to have a a tag with no href just so I can borrow the a styling and we're going to have photo which is going to be a component and then I'm gonna have link just like this is going to be another component and it's going to say welcome there okay and then I'm just gonna end it so slash and just like that all right so I got user info and then in their card background and the a tag okay now right underneath this a tag I'm going to have another eight tag again with the no href okay it's just like this it's at this a tag and I have add photo text component and that's just going to say add a photo just like that okay now there are tons of components that we need to go and make so let's get go ahead and get started it's like three or four maybe more so let's go user info and I'm just gonna do style div let's leave it empty then we need card background and I'm gonna do something similar which is gonna be styled div let's leave that empty let's go cons photo and let's go here let's leave that empty and then um let's go cons link for the link component and again this is a div we're going to leave it empty for now and add photo text okay let's leave that empty for now as well okay user info is not defined boom welcome there add a photo that's what you should be seeing right now cool so now we're going to start adding all the styling in here so for user info let's get started with that so A couple of things are going to be happening here we're going to give it a border bottom of one pixel solid okay there we go so that gave it a little nice little drop shadow here makes it look beautiful so it's a border bottom I didn't add the Border anywhere else 12 pixel 12 pixels by 16 pixels okay so now this is much more centered we have padding going left we're getting padding going this way and we got padding going that way okay so far so good let's go word wrap and we'll do break word cool and let's go ahead and go ahead and do this cool so Sometimes some of this we might not need honestly but it's okay I'm going to leave it here word break um break word cool okay so let's go ahead and let's keep on going okay inside of my card background we're going to now okay so first of all we're going to add a background image to this okay so let's go background and give it a URL and that's going to be Images slash card background.svg cool close it put a semicolon good hit refresh refresh cool so that image is not showing up but that image is going to start showing up in just a little bit so let's give it a background position of Center let's go give it a background size of 462 pixels let's go give it a height of 54 pixels so now you can start to see that image show up and let's give it a margin of negative 12 negative 12 0. so now that card is starting to look pretty perfect pretty freaking perfect okay pretty and perfect there we go so card background we're good on okay now let's just go ahead and add photo in there so photo is going to require us to do a bit of styling but it's going to look so freaking beautiful when it's done so I'm going to start off with not having any box Shadow uh for background image let's go ahead and choose the photo image so images I'm going to do slash photo.svg okay now we're going to make this thing show up in just a second so let's give it a certain width let's also give it a certain height so now the image is showing up cool now we're going to start making it look better cool height I'm going to give it box sizing border box background clip content box background color let's go white okay background position Center cool so that changed how the image was looking I'm gonna give it a background size of 60 percent beautiful and then we have um background repeat at no repeat actually cool so because we don't want it repeating over and over again we just want one camera and that's how we get it now let's go and do border and for Border we're gonna do two pixels solid white clean okay margin let's give it a margin of 30 negative 38 pixels Auto 12 pixel like that damn look at that one line of code and beautifully smacks that in the middle guys like isn't that beautiful when you have these little touches and they all keep adding on and then your front end just just beautiful all right and then uh let's give it a border radius of 50 percent now we got it round nice and round just how we like it okay now let's go inside of our link and make that do good things let's go 16 pixels for the font size line height will go 1.5 okay that added some line height to this okay foreign let's go here and go color and we'll change the color just a little bit so we're gonna go zero zero zero zero point nine cool and then after that we're just going to choose the font way to be kind of boldish okay let's go 600 so welcome there boom a little bold man looks so nice right on the left hand side is looking beautiful when I go in this mode it looks great and mobile you know most people get lazy on the mobile but not us we make sure that that mobile version is uh is looking clutch you know is it distracting when I'm in the center probably I'll just keep myself to the side for now okay all right so that that looks great okay and then add photo to text add photo text let's go give it a color and let's start off with this okay cool we got a little blue action going on let's give some margin from the top so give it a little separation from welcome there right it was way too close and feeling a little uncomfortable and we got it out of there give it a little font size of 12 pixels line height uh again line height gives things some nice breathing room so it just does not hurt and then we'll give it a font weight of 400 makes it just a little bit Tad tad bit darker if we go 700 that's a little too much but 400 is just just right and just enough so perfect that's looking great now let's add a widget component inside of our art card okay so let's go ahead and do that now all right now let's work on our widget okay so first things first we're going to go inside of our uh left side component great and then here I want to add my widget okay so right underneath the user info I'm going to add this widget right there just like that okay this is going to be a widget component open up the a tag okay and then we're gonna create a div inside of that div I'm going to have some span tags so spandex and this is gonna say the first span tag is going to say connections and then the next span tag is going to say grow your network just like that okay now I need to close that a tag that's why it's complaining great and uh I need to actually add an SVG inside of that so what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy this SVG that I'm adding okay and um we're gonna call it the Widget icon all right so I'm going to go inside of my so let's take this Widget icon right over here okay and I'm simply going to add that to my images so drag and drop cool so now once you have that SVG SVG we're also going to add in our item icon okay that's another one we're gonna need so this item icon one little bookmark looking thing okay so let's also get that and add that to our images so drag drop cool so we got that SVG going now let's go back to our left side and here's what we're gonna do okay inside of this a tag inside of this um actually where are we planning to add this where am I planning to add this so let's see here we got where's my div action going on grow your network so right underneath grow your network um this actually needs to be wrapped up in a div I believe okay so let's go here yeah so this this needs to get wrapped up in a div okay boom just let's do it like that okay so widget a tag div span cool and um right outside of this div ending is where we're gonna make our magic happen okay so let's go outside of this div and I'm going to do image and the image source is going to be that SVG file that we talked that we just added okay and afterward the widget ends we're going to add in another component called item within that we're going to have a span tag within that we're going to have another image or a image and that's going to be slash images item hyphen icon.svg okay and just so you have some idea what is happening is we're going to be doing a lot of this stuff so we're going to be adding this we're going to be adding this okay so there's a bunch of stuff happening like that so hang in there Buttercup it'll be great and if you're watching this and you're enjoying this so far do your friend a favor and smash smash that like button and keep that energy high in here okay I love your beautiful face and let's keep going okay so widget we're gonna need um just create a style component okay and just for you guys I didn't do an ASMR version okay because you guys didn't like that very much so let's go ahead and uh let's add in a widget just like this and we're gonna do two things we're gonna add in widget and we're gonna add an item cool so widget component just in the start was going to be styled div I'm going to leave it empty and then also let's add in um for item okay let's go item is going to be a styled a and just start off with empty so let's put slash here by the way that was a little typo so boom slash not Dash cool so now both of the images should be here right there okay if I full screen this thing you should see them connections grow your network and we got both of our images right cool okay so let's go ahead all the way down and start styling this uh widget okay so that's gonna take a second actually to style because there's a couple of things happening here let's go about border bottom one pixel solid all right beautiful uh let's add some padding to the top of this thing cool and let's add some padding to the bottom of this thing beautiful let's go ahead and uh style the a tags inside of this thing and I'm gonna give it a text decoration of uh of none let's go display Flex because we're gonna need that justify content and I want to give it space between okay so you saw how this thing got pushed right that's kind of what we want this on the left side this on the right side and there's space in between that's why we write that align items Center and we're going to give it some padding cool okay so on Hover it gets darker and it kind of gets highlighted okay whoops my face is blocking pretty much everything great so when I hover boom boom looking pretty magnificent my friend uh background color on Hover we got some action going on okay now let's go under hover and let's do something okay so just go display Flex and we'll go flex Direction and we'll go column okay so connections and grow your network got written out on separate lines because this is a span tag this is a span tag and because of doing column they both got pushed onto their own columns let's go attacks a line and we'll go left so now connections and grow your network are you know evened out more and within this let's uh style our span tags even further so let's go give it font size of 12 pixels a little bit smaller let's give it a line height of 1.33333 so we got some spacing going on in between some room to breathe it's like when I'm sleeping with my girlfriend and I just want to like not spoon for a second you know I'm basically giving a little line height in between because sometimes it just gets way too hot um first child uh AKA Monet's first I'm kidding all right here we go let's give it a color or GBA it's a it's one of the members on our team and I don't know if we're supposed to say this on YouTube but she's having a baby so we're excited we're super excited for her we're pumped we're super happy let's go here let's go ahead and uh let's go 0.06 beautiful and then underneath the first child let's go with a nth child whoops whoops whoops whoops whoops and child just like that and let's give it what happened here just like that okay there we go so now these styled things have certain ways of how they're colored okay so that's good and uh let's close out of all of this and then the last thing we want to do is we want to give certain styling to SVG hopefully that actually does something cool um so there we go so now this component is looking really beautiful I mean like look at it right on the left hand side connections grow your network that little icon right there I mean just fine little touches and this entire app is coming along so freaking well I mean like just look at this thing right it's beautiful so that's great now we're gonna go ahead and style our item component right because that's another one that we were gonna do so let's go ahead and do that one okay where's item component item component has the item icon so I imagine it's this one but hopefully we're not wrong let's go let's give it a border color whoops and technically those correct code um okay that text align it to the left I mean do we even have text in there oh yeah let's go ahead and add text in there okay so let's go to let's go to our item we have span and we have an image and right underneath this we'll say my items okay just like that so what did left a line do let's see if I delete that line what happens absolutely nothing perfect great just how I like my styling to do things um padding let's give it 12 pixels font size 12 pixels is great and then let's go display block okay nice so now it's looking perfect um I want to give it a certain let's let's work on the span a little bit so first things first I'm going to start it off with enabling Flex on it and then let's go and vertically align everything with the line items play with the color just a little bit it just makes it kind of like a dark black okay and then let's get out of here right there and on Hover I wanna change the color just like that okay boom boom boom boom hey hey nice look at these cards now this thing is coming look at how much we got completed it's looking great you you are great thank you for being here so far and I really I mean in all seriousness I really appreciate your support thank you so much and let's keep going this one is for the boys and the girls okay great progress so far cupcake but uh now is not the time to quit now is the time to go harder so we can finish it and make your portfolio look amazing so you can get that dream job okay right now is not the time to quit so let's keep on rocking and rolling uh let's work on the community card okay so first things first we're gonna need this image this is that plus sign uh finished version of that looks like this this is going to be the community card okay so that's what we're gonna be working on so let's go ahead grab that sign and add it to my images folder okay all right so once you got that plus signed let's go to the left side and uh let's add that thing in okay so go to let's go to under our art card where it ends so where does it end right there let's go under there underwear and let's do community card component hit tab hit a tab okay so we're gonna now borrow the link tag styling just like that and inside of our link tag I'm gonna hit make a span and the span is going to have the word groups in there okay and uh now I'm going to make another a tag that's going to be empty just like this inside of here we're going to have another span and inside of there I'm gonna have the word events and right underneath that I will have my image and um my image is going to be the Plus icon SVG that I got okay so again Community card I got my a tag here my a tag here with some span with the span tag in there okay two a tags with Spam tags in there and um we're gonna need just essentially uh a few more things okay so let's have another a tag blank and inside of here let's have a span tag that says follows whoops let's say follow hashtags okay and then right underneath that I'm gonna have another a tag that says span and they'll say discover more just like this okay so we have one a tag two three and four each a tag has one span tag one two three four so four a tags four span tags got it everything inside of the community card cool good all right so now let's go ahead and make our styled component called Community card so let's go and let's have it borrow from styled card let's hit save and Community card is not defined cool there we go so now we got this ugly looking thing right here but hey at least it's right here and it's ours so that's good plus sign so now let's go inside of this thing and let's start working on it so let's add some padding cool that gives it some breathing room let's text align everything to be on the left that's better let's make it display flex and you know what and I'm gonna give it a Gonna Make It Go in columns cool aha looking way better clean let's go down and uh let's start styling the attack so let's select the eight eight tags now color black cool my girlfriend's favorite color uh let's go like this boom that padding gives it nice breathing room from the left and from the top Let's uh play with the font size and give it 12 pixels and then I'm going to do vertical a line on this thing and let's see if it actually does anything I don't even think we need this thing Okay cool so let's just leave that out for now because otherwise it just gets confusing cool let's go and go on Hover let's add some functionality to it so let's make the color go and do the that blue thing okay so when I hover over it each one of these highlights yeah boom boom boom great okay cool now under hover what I want to do is let's go to our span and let's go display Flex let's go align items and I'm going to vertically Center great so now events is looking good because before it was looking stupid with the plus sign let's go justify content and I'm gonna go space between cool so now that plus sign has a space between and it gives it nice little breathing room there okay let's get out of the span tag and uh we're gonna grab the last child okay and we're gonna give it a color okay we're gonna make that gray text decoration of course is none border top let's go one pixel solid with this color I think cool so this border top has done that thing right there that like line that partition that we got okay so and underneath this I'm going to add some padding great and let's add in a little hover and 0.08 cool oh too dark let's lighten that up 0.08 baby yeah blue blue blue hover nice man this is looking freaking slick search bar looks great my icon here looks great the front end is looking it's looking good looking pretty freaking good okay all right I'm in like 200 zoom on my screen but you know so yours might look slightly different but that's okay all right so really good progress here and uh uh I think let's keep on going all right so next up um let's go and add the follow card component on the right hand side well what is that what is that Causey it's going to be um some of this all right the follow component so let's start working on this thing now boom so let's go add follow card component so I'm gonna go to my right side component now and inside of my right card component I'm going to remove what we have here and instead I'm going to add a new component called follow card okay so inside of my container I'm gonna have a follow card component now inside of here I'm just going to write the text right side and of course it's gonna complain it doesn't know what it is no worries we're going to create a follow card component now or style component now okay so so far it should just be saying right side and not really doing anything okay no worries now let's go text the line let's go text a line and we'll go Center uh overflow Let's Go hidden okay great um let's go and add margin bottom eight pixels background color okay so now the right side is having a little like border radius around it okay it's at the bottom we'll fix that but that's what you should be having so I just zoomed out a little bit from my app right side should be there on your mobile type of view and on full screen view um right side should be kind of at the bottom right right now Okay cool so uh we added a little border radius that gave it the rounded Corners let's go ahead and do position relative and let's go border none and I'm gonna give it a box Shadow and let's go like this with our box shadow okay mysterious mysterious box Shadow and then padding we're gonna go 12 pixels cool so now right side should be kind of a lot more visible and much bigger okay all right I have to zoom out a little bit and get 225 percent and that's that allows me to see it okay now we're going to add a title inside of our card so let's get our feed icon and we're going to put that in images because that's what we're going to need now cool so with that icon on the way let's go back to right side and um inside here we're gonna add that since I'll go let's go where we had the word right side written and remove it and instead we'll replace it with a component called title and inside of this component I'm going to add a H2 and this H2 is going to say add to your feed let's hit save so it auto formats it I have prettier extension you can get the prettier extension from here if you want your auto completion to work and on also for auto completion to work you should go to your um workspace settings okay so just go to your settings how do I even get to my settings go to your settings and have format and do default formatter prettier and also format on Save so once you do that your formatting should start to work okay cool um so add title now inside of our title I have my h2 tag and underneath that I'm going to add my image and my image source is going to be this one right here and all the way at the bottom we're going to now add the styled styling for this component const title and I'm going to say inline Flex on this thing so right there okay great let's go down align items okay and I'm gonna justify content let's go space between that should space things out for us cool let's go ahead hit refresh great and let's go font size and I'm gonna go 16 pixels all right and with 100 beautiful and again color okay so that gives it a little gray add to your feed Okay add to your feed that's what that should look like pretty simple all right so we're good with that and now we're gonna add feed follow list okay that's what we're gonna do so that's gonna add multiple more things this is going to be the big one it's gonna add a lot of things cool so great now let's add the feed list okay so under the title I'm going to create my feed list cool so let's go ahead and do it like this and as a matter of fact do I even need that other uh add to your feed stuff don't really think I need that anymore actually let's add the feed list underneath our title okay so leave the title as is and underneath that let's add our feed list okay I'm just gonna do this it's kind of like easier to see all right so let's go feed list component and inside of here I'm gonna have um here's how I'm gonna do this okay let's go there keep the a tag empty inside of here I'm going to have an avatar component whoops an avatar component like that and underneath this I'm going to have a div that div is going to have a span tag and it's going to say Linked In like this okay uh underneath that let's put a button that says follow cool so feed list um list okay the LI inside of that we have an a tag that's that's going to have an avatar component then we have a div that has LinkedIn and then a button that says follow cool all right so underneath this let's Get Out Underneath this and let's create another list okay inside of there we'll have another a tag again let's remove the ahref um cool let's put our Avatar component again and let's go div on this thing span I'm gonna go video cool and then I'm gonna go button and this button is also going to say follow great all right now it's like hey I don't know feed list I don't know Avatar so no worries we're just gonna go ahead and uh create stylings for them and this is going to be a styled uh UL okay unordered list and then we're going to to also create a styling for Avatar let's do that so now you should see on the right hand side we have add to your feed LinkedIn and then video cool now this feed list let's go inside of it and let's go margin top 16 pixels and we'll go display flex and align items Center great it's looking good margin will give it a 12 pixel so that gave it again some Breathing Room between LinkedIn and the word video I'm gonna give it a position that's relative and font size let's go 14 pixels on this thing so it's going to be on the smaller side and then let's select the div just like that and let's go display Flex in there and I'm gonna go flex Direction column on it okay to just make sure that the follow button is underneath where it says LinkedIn and video okay and uh let's get out of this and here I'm gonna now style the button so background color let's go transparent color okay a little gray these are some ugly buttons right now but I swear they're gonna look good by the time we're done with them the bun looks Goofy okay and they're getting uglier by the second okay padding 16 pixels okay fat buttons now and uh we're gonna vertically align them let's give it a little border radius so it has slightly rounded Corners that's better box sizing I'm gonna do border box font weight cool I'm gonna justify the content to be Center give it a Max height of 32 pixels in Min height actually I'm going to give it a Max width instead of 480 pixels text align Center and outline none great so looking good so far I'm liking it okay and now we're gonna go and do this stuff with the Avatar okay so let's get out of this uh and we're done with the we're done with the feed list let's go inside of our Avatar one now and inside of our Avatar we're gonna add the background image let's give it a URL and um I'll show you guys this image as well but uh this is what it is just type it out with me.com slash c h 1b4v oh my goodness I'll try to make it easier for you and add it somewhere inside of uh GitHub but this is the image okay it's kind of ridiculous I'm sorry but that's that's what it is okay so you can type that out or maybe we'll put it in our in my GitHub repo so you can kind of have access to it cool so boom let's go back round size and we'll do contain background position center let's go no repeat and with the 48 pixels and then let's go height of 48 pixels okay great coming along okay coming along so that's good so far by the way if you're wondering what that image is it's that like big plus sign that we have in our final app so let me just show you it's that one right over there actually actually I think I got the image wrong myself so this is what it actually is now boom we got that hashtag symbol right over there okay that's what that is so now that's looking better all right now let's add recommendation component and add a banner card cool so let's go ahead and do that baby girl all right we got the right icon and uh that's actually do we have the right icon did we add the right icon it's this one right here beautiful looks kind of silly did I add it I can't remember let's drop it in right here again boom I mean looks like I never added it before okay now that I added that let's go back to um our right side so let's go right side and then inside here underneath the feed list component once we get out of that one let's go ahead and create a recommendation component and under my recommendation component I'm gonna go view all recommendations okay and underneath here I'm gonna add image and let's go Images slash right icon Dash SVG cool so and now it goes hey recommendation is not defined well not a problem my friend let's go all the way down wait what's Happening Here recommendation wait I meant to do this view all right it should be wrapped in recommendations the image there we go that's better okay and recommendation let's create a new style component for it recommendation and we're gonna go style a cool let's just leave that now I'm also going to need a banner card okay so let's go and add the banner card right underneath the follow card okay so let's go Banner card just like that and um inside of the banner card I'm gonna add an image and that image is also going to have a really annoying source all right I'm gonna paste that in right there all right so again I'm gonna try to give you access to um the image but for whatever reason if you're unable to get it I'm just gonna paste that image right here um so you can see it okay it's gonna be this image and this is the URL um yeah there you go okay but I'm gonna try to make it easy for you guys to get it so I'll work on that so Banner card um yep that's it for the banner card and then now we just have to create styling for it okay so let's go all the way down for Banner card and let's go Banner card and for styling let's just um inherit our styling from follow card cool let's go here and refresh great let's go in our recommendation and go color give it a little color for our recommendations our blue color so view all recommendation it now has that blue color that you can see and it's looking good okay now let's go underneath here let's go display Flex let's go align item Center and font size 14 pixels cool so just made that a little bit smaller and then for Banner card what we're going to do is we're just gonna say hit image make the width of it a hundred percent and then make the height of it a hundred percent and that's it okay that is it oh by the way um I was wondering why my right side was messed up I in my file um which file am I in right now I think right um yep so right side JS inside of this file this was like at the bottom right and I was like why is this the bottom right so um this is a small typo okay so it's right side lower case okay and that actually brings that to the top right okay so make sure you have that right all right that ad image is acting a little funny so we're just gonna keep going and then we're gonna have that image show up okay but for now uh the banner card I'm not gonna worry about it I'm just gonna uh keep rocking and rolling okay so just bear with me and let's go so now we're gonna add a common card component okay so let's go inside of Main um and in here we're going to basically create that component let's go here const common card okay and we're going to do this okay and uh text align it to be Center I'm gonna overflow hidden margin bottom all right this is going to be helpful for the share box in just a second but just um let's keep going with this hang in there with me and it'll make sense very very soon okay so we're gonna basically add in margin bottom eight pixels to this thing background color and we're gonna we're gonna actually inherit from this okay because it's going to be our common styling and then we're gonna inherit from this card um let's go border radius and go five pixels I'll go position relative border none and then we're gonna do the Box Shadow game of that RGB that and cool so now we got our box Shadow our box Shadow is good to go and uh let's go ahead and actually start using this okay so I'm gonna go into my container let's remove Main and instead of main we're going to create a new component called share box inside of sharebox I'm just going to write in the word share and then let's create a styling for share box so const share box and I'm gonna go and inherit I want to inherit my styling from common card okay and then let's go and do display Flex Flex Direction I'm gonna go column okay and uh now we got the share component showing up right over here okay that's perfect that's what we want the share to be showing up right in the middle color okay so that gives it a very light gray I'm gonna margin like this cool and then background white okay so share box is looking good we're inheriting the share box features uh from our other component called common card okay so now in our share box we're gonna be adding a bunch of things okay what is sharebox you might ask well that's a really really good question so let's actually see what sharebox is so share box I believe is going to be our um this one right here this is are going to be our share box okay we got photo video event and article in there okay that's what we're working on right now so um AKA our post box okay so let's add those things in I'm actually excited to build that component out that component is going to be a lot of fun and that component is going to have some really dope modals that go along with it okay so get excited so first things first I'm gonna need a couple of couple of icons all of those icons actually so I'm gonna need my article icon that one right there I'm gonna need my event icon so let's go and find it starts with an E Event icon I'm also going to need my photo icon look for a p photo icon and then I'm also going to need my video icon where is that right there cool so let's take these I'll open up my public images and doom drop it in right there pop it like it alright let's delete this one cool all right um so this is good now um let's refresh so we got all of our images not okay that's good let's go to main JS now and in our main file we're gonna now start adding all of this okay so under share box I'm just gonna add in a div and inside of the div let's add in images and um let's add in our user SVG okay so that big that's a big image right there that we added cool it's taking up the whole screen right now but that's okay we're gonna fix that soon and then right underneath that we're going to do button and say start a post cool so underneath that we're going to have another div inside of that div we'll have another button and then inside of that button we'll have another image and then this image is going to have our photo icon.svg okay so like look right underneath that user image we got this thing going on right here okay what doesn't look like this right now but we're working on it okay we got the image part down and we got the photo down now we're going to take that image and we're going to control it soon because that image is out of control right now we're gonna control it don't worry okay and uh and you'll see how that happens okay so I got my button right here with an image inside of it and uh right underneath this uh image actually let's add in a span Tag and Call say photo cool so now that's looking good underneath this button let's add in another button and and this button right here is going to have another image in here this image is going to be slash images event icon dot SVG just like that cool so that's event um actually we got photo icon.svg and this one let's make it video icon okay and then the span tag right underneath it is going to be video okay then let's have another button hopefully you're getting the rhythm of this okay and then inside of this button we're gonna have image and we're gonna have slash Images slash Images slash event icon dot SVG okay and then underneath this image we'll have span event just like that cool and lastly I'm going to have another button which is going to have an image inside of it that image is going to be I don't know where it starts writing it goes crazy slash Images slash article icon dot SVG okay and the span tag here simply going to say right article just like that now let's go and check it out all of them are right there that looks great making progress photo video article we got the whole shebang in here okay cool and then what we got to do is we gotta start adding styling to it so let's go to our share box and underneath our share box where we added background white we're going to add an additional styling okay so let's create a let's create a select the div not create and uh for div we're gonna style the buttons like so and these autocompletes are painful so this button is going to have the styling of outline none cool underneath here we're gonna have color okay font size let's give it a 14 pixels right all right so underneath this let's do mid height of 48 pixels cool background transparent okay so caught the caught the crazy thing all right so share box make sure the whole freaking thing is wrapped in share box okay now that's the error okay this is why it's important to catch these errors boom okay now um if I uncomment this out because I commented it right now because I was like there's literally no difference that's happening okay so let's just go line by line here and see uh oops let's just comment well comments that's the whole um thing at once so let's try it like that okay so I'm gonna uncomment this color okay that made it a little bit gray I think you can see that right that made a little bit Gray okay now that made the font size a little bit bigger right uh line height cold I give it a little height cool let's go mid height boom we got a midnight action going on and uh lastly but not leastly let's make the background transparent okay so clear clear that out great now we're going to add a couple of more things to this okay cool so now under background we're gonna make sure that border is none okay so now the border is gone and it's starting to look a lot better yeah so boom that's that's looking beautiful let's go display Flex nice that looks a lot more beautiful now clean and then let's go align items Center nice font weight should be 600 yeah that looks great that looks great all right we're doing good now underneath this button let's get into the first child and uh display Flex okay so we're starting to control that image a little bit align items Center okay let's go padding nice some more control on that uh image it's always a good sign now we're gonna get into really controlling that image already looking better baby uh border radius of course fifty percent will give it that nice circular feel and then margin right eight pixels aha look at that we're getting we're getting somewhere with that now we're getting somewhere with that now so let's get out of that image now and uh now let's dig into the button okay okay so you saw what margin did right it gave it more margin from the top in this case we're gonna have Flex grow one and then let's go border radius 35 pixels cool okay and uh let's go on and go padding left my bad left 16 pixels cool okay so far so good let's go border one pixel solid and then we're gonna essentially give it that color right there okay so now you can see start a post actually has a little border around it right and how did that happen so for example if I remove border radius now look it looks square but if I put that border radius there boom it's looking nice and circular like that okay now let's add background color and we'll add white cool and then text a line and I'm going to text align everything to be left great great great great great great okay and now let's get out of here and let's deal with the nth child uhhuh looks like that all right and we'll go display Flex he has so beautiful it's coming together Flex wrap wrap beautiful justify content base around so we'll give space around looks clean okay and then underneath here we'll go padding bottom okay so you saw how it gave it some breathing room from here right there give it breathing room right there okay and then the button the buttons here image uh the the image inside of the buttons okay let's go ahead and control that zero cool that controls it that's great great so so take a look at the images right here these images but when I add that line now those images have some margin from the text because they were initially way too close all right now let's get outside of that image and let's deal with span and here boom and now we got the beautiful blue action going on amazing amazing you guys okay that was um absolutely incredible work and um you know I just want to say that I'm proud of you for getting up to here and making such great progress so far you've been absolutely amazing but we're not done yet and we got a lot of way to go for example you know we I mean as amazing as this is looking already right and I bet you even completely forgot we actually have a freaking home page right which is completely mobile responsive by the way okay and if I hit slash home now we get redirected to home right so this is all the front end functionality and this is great but remember we still need to add more things to it like for example we still need to be able to add Firebase to it so we have login and logout functionality from the home page we still need to be able to add uh react router redirecting you on login to to this page and then we need to add more functionality around being able to write a post so we're going to need a modal we're going to be able to we're going to need to be able to add text in that modal and then add images in there and add videos in there and then we're gonna need to be able to store that inside of Firebase and then we're going to need to be able to read that from Firebase and show all of it here and then we're going to need to write react code that can show those components and everything in a beautiful way okay so we're doing great so far but we got a long way to go so hang tight you're doing fantastic smash the

that you actually need all right now let's actually start adding the article portion okay that means like we'll be able to see some of the Articles so here we go so first things first okay um let's go over to our main JS where we're at right now I'm gonna zoom out just a little bit because that was a little too close and claustrophobic for comfort and let's go right underneath the share box okay so where is it let's go to main and I'll go right underneath the share box where sharebox is ending and let's open up a div and inside of this div I'm going to add an article okay and inside of this article I'm just gonna say article like so okay and let's hit refresh now it says it's not defined because we need to make a styling for that component okay so let's go ahead const article and again I can do styled and I'm gonna copy from the common card okay so let's go like this beautiful now we have an article right here pretty clean okay pretty nice so let's hit save now let's actually add more things to this okay so first thing I'm going to do I'm just going to add padding zero to it cool margin of Zero by Zero by eight pixels okay and then I'm gonna do overflow I'm just gonna say visible on this thing okay so our article is here it looks great I like how it looks I like how you look and you're important and I love you okay never let anybody tell you otherwise I'm here to support you all right let's keep going so great job on the article all right now let's work on the uh Ellipsis okay so first what I want you to do is open it up Whoopsie Daisy you're crazy all right this is the Ellipsis SVG it looks like that three collapsible dots okay so what I want you to do is open up your public open up your images and then open up your that's inappropriate open up your heart that's what I was going to say and drop that image all right great now that you got that image what we're going to do is we're gonna go inside of our main and we're gonna do a couple of things okay let's go inside of our article component that we made and we're gonna remove what we put inside of there all right simply because we're gonna change that bad boy up and add a new component called shared actor okay and inside of this shared actor I'm going to make a link tag now I don't actually need the link I just need to borrow the styling so I'm just gonna leave it like this and I'm gonna give it an image and we're going to give it a user.sme where the F where does it start typing okay like so okay and uh so that's pretty good as long as our a tag and image is concerned now inside of this a tag I'm going to also add another div okay and this div is going to have span and I'm gonna have title after title I'll have info okay capitalize the title T and then we're gonna have date just like so underneath this a tag I'm going to add a button that button is going to have an image and we're going to give it an ellipsis uh and image SVG okay now it's complaining it's like yeah I don't know what the shared actor is no problem const shared actor okay just like that we're gonna give it a style div make it empty and save and refresh and it should be defined now okay so now we see title info date right next to each other very uncomfortably close with the three dots okay great so let's start adding some styling to it and make it look good okay make it look good in the hood like you should let's go and do that okay for the shared actor so now that's going to require a lot of styling hang in there let's give it padding right of 40 pixels oops cannot see it cool let's go down and I'm going to give it if Lex wrap and we'll do no wrap on this thing okay and just make sure the whole thing is wrapped and shared or shared actor just like that okay padding I want to give it 12 pixel by 16 pixels by zero cool okay whoops all right let's see okay this is where we have it it's looking good we got some padding going now let's uh do a couple of more things to it okay I'm gonna add margin to bottom let's go like this and add some margin and uh underneath that let's go align items Center cool and let's keep going all right so now let's go ahead and add under align items I'm going to make sure my display is flex okay cool starting to look pretty okay sometimes certain things don't happen but I promise they take some time and then they come together cool so we got display Flex now underneath here let's style our a tag akr link tag and I'm going to give it a margin right of 12 pixels okay so now that button moved just a little bit to the right that's beautiful now make sure you keep hitting save for the changes to take place so that gives it margin great now let's go flex grow we'll do one on this all right beautiful damage is taken up a lot of that nice and uh now I'm gonna do overflow hidden cool and then let's do display Flex okay whoops did not mean to do that all right so now you should have the image here the three dots to the right just like that and then if I full screen it it should still look very similar to this okay cool let's keep on going now underneath it this again doesn't really matter that much but I just like to do it just to be safe that no links have any text decoration just because it's annoying let's go inside here and now let's dial the image tag that's inside of the link tag and I'll give it a width of 48. pixels nice and I will give it a height of 48 pixels cool so now what you see is that right there okay so you should see title info date and the three dots great now let's get outside of this image and we will select our div and let's go display Flex cool Flex direction will go column so now title info date should be each On Their Own Line okay um let's go flex grow one on this awesome so now title info date should be in the middle okay and we'll do Flex bases of zero all right so we got the flex bases now let's go margin uh left on this thing and we'll go eight pixels for margin so that gave it just a tiny little margin you'll see it move a little bit and I'm gonna go overflow hidden again cool so we don't want to see any type of weird overflow happening and span let's control the span now so text align I'm going to say left so now title info date should be right up next to the image let's grab the first child okay and then we'll go font size 14 pixels cool makes it a little bit smaller we'll make it now bolder with font weight and again first child is that text right here okay and then let's give it a color and we'll go zero zero zero one okay so that makes it just a little bit uh darker okay then outside of this span tag what we're gonna do actually we're still inside of the span but we're outside of the first child right so inside of this span tag let's also style another element so I'm gonna go um basically this means this thing that you're styling all right so that and is referring to this shared actor style div so I'm saying this divs um nth child and I'm gonna go n plus one foreign and let's go font size 12 pixels cool and then we'll go color great so now the whole thing is just a little bit Gray okay so that's pretty good now we're gonna go outside of pretty much all of that and we're gonna style a button component on its own so we're gonna go outside of all of these squigglies and we'll now style the button component and we'll say position absolute so now the button should be hovering right over the photo we'll say right by 12 pixels cool top of zero nice background transparent like so border will go none outline will go none so now there's no boxes around it now there's no boxes around that Ellipsis right it's just Ellipsis by itself and uh that's it on the when it comes to this component for now this is pretty good and now let's keep on going all right now let's add description and a shared image okay that's what we're calling it so let's go and find her and this is the image that I want you to use okay this is we'll make a random post so that's the image and uh cool now let's go to our main after we got that image and now let's start actually working on this okay so what we need to do at this point is we need to find where our shared actor component is which is right here underneath our shared actor component we need to now add a new component and we're going to call that component description inside of description I'll just say the text description just like that that's it okay so that's good uh let's see what is happening here cool cool now underneath description we're gonna add one more thing we're going to add a new component and it's going to be called shared image just like this and inside of here we're going to have an a tag that's going to be empty and inside of this a tag we're gonna have an image like so shared image.jpg okay so again description boom again it's complaining that it doesn't know what those style components are no worries we'll add them in right now so let's go add a description that boom beautiful here we go that image is just out of control right now okay that image is overflowing everywhere so all good now we just need to figure out how to control that image okay and uh we'll do that now by styling so inside of my description let's add padding 0 by 16 pixels overflow let's make it hidden foreign let's go like that okay let's make it a little bit darker cool all right and then we're gonna go and text align it to the left now you can't see that much right now but now you'll see it okay there we go so save boom that's where my description is that's what you should be seeing right now but really the thing we need to style is that image so let's control that so first of all let's give it a little bit of margin from the top there so now it has a little separation between the word text and the image itself let's give it a width of a hundred percent cool so again it's still crazy but we'll control it in a second let's go here let's go display block cool let's go position relative all right and then background color okay all right and then let's control the image inside of this tag so let's go image object fit contain so still the image should be pretty much out of control with 100 percent and finally the image is starting to come into control so let's put a semicolon here semicolon here and beautiful so now it actually looks like a legitimate post right description title info date if I go full screen I have description here so now this is looking like an actual post that is great that's what we want all right so now it's looking like an actual image right it looks good so let's keep on going with this and now add social counts underneath here right so for example how many likes does this image have how many upvotes does it have and reactions and things like that kind of like in the finished version I can see that there are 75 reactions that I have zero comments how many likes comments shares send all of that cool so um let's go ahead and add all of those things in now so what I'm going to do is I will go and underneath underneath my shared image component so let's go right underneath that and I'm going to add my social counts component okay that's what we're going to call it let's go ahead and create our list and then inside of it we'll make a button and inside of that button I'm going to add my image okay and uh these images are again we're going to give you access to all these images but this is um gonna be an image that I kind of just pulled all right it's an online it's a URL all right what I'm going to do is I'm just going to download this image so it's less annoying for you guys let's see um is there an easy way to actually download this image though there's no easy way to download that image so actually let's just use the CDN okay that we have here and let's just stick with that okay so this is the URL for it and again we'll add all of these images inside of the GitHub repo so you can access all of them okay so that's going to give you your like button let's add another image right underneath this okay and uh this is going to be the following URL and uh we'll add that one whoops let's add that one right there this one okay great so now we got these two images okay and this image right here you can go look it up this image is going to be um the Clapping Emoji okay really hard to see I'll have to zoom in quite a bit so you can see it but yeah this is the Clapping one okay so make sure you have that one and underneath this image I want to add in another thing and we'll just add span tag and we'll say 75. as then to say that we have 75 reactions so far okay button cool and right underneath this list ending let's do another one Li and then inside of here we're going to do an a tag again remove the entire ahref and uh we're gonna say one comment okay let's just do two comments like this okay and hit save cool so we got social count inside of here we have a list we have you know one button here now one button has two images and that span cool okay great now let's go ahead and add in The Styling for our social counts component so I'm gonna do con social counts styled unordered list save the error should go away save again go ahead refresh come back cool all right so now I see this um I see 75 reactions thumbs up clapping 75 claps and I see two comments right underneath it okay looks good but let's make it look better okay let me full screen this that's what it looks like right now okay so now we have to do a bunch of styling work to make sure that this looks good so let's add a line height to it about 1.3 okay so that gave it a little breathing room for two comments let's go display Flex all right now they're pushed to the left hand side I'm gonna align items to be to start kind of right at the start so that's good I'm gonna make overflow Auto for this margin let's give it 0 by 16 pixels okay so now it's pushed a little bit from the left hand side padding and then give it a little bit of padding okay good so padding went ahead and right added more of this so now it's nicely centered and looks like we have again more breathing room there border let's give it a border bottom of one pixel solid and give it a give it this color here cool okay looking nice looking nice okay let's give it a list style and we'll go and give it none okay so those two dots that were showing up now are just completely gone and now let's actually select the list and style it so I'm gonna go margin right on this thing and let's go five pixels right we'll go font size 12 pixels cool so now the two comments are small button display Flex cool so it looks pretty freaking good now okay so that gives us our social that we were looking to add okay uh now what I want to do is I want to add social button actions inside of the article okay so now we're going to make it look even better we're going to add the comments button the like one and bunch of them cool so first things first let's go ahead and find them so I have comments comments is going to be that one right there at the top and we have our like icon so that one we have our send icon let's find that boom right there and then of course we have our share icon right there okay let's drag all of them straight into images cool so we got all of those inside of images so now we're good all right so now we got those images and we are gonna now start putting those inside okay so let's go ahead and let's go right under where our social accounts component ends so I'm going to go right underneath here and right there I'm going to add a button and inside of this button I'm going to add an image and this image is going to be my like icon dot SVG cool so now you should see a like button up here on your screen like so great after this let's go actually let's add the button word like next to it too because I think that'll look nice so let's go and let's add in the word like great so now we have a blue button and we have the text that says like cool okay let's go um underneath here and let's add in another button now okay and inside of this let's add an image and let's go images comments Dash icon SVG great so you got the like button and now we got the comment and we'll do a similar thing we'll do span tag and I'm just gonna say comments plural great and now we're going to repeat that okay so I'm going to just copy this button I'm going to paste and paste and where it says comments icon I'm going to share the remove uh replace our share icon and this one I'm going to replace it with send icon so now I have a share icon right here and a send icon right here I'm going to remove this word with the word share and I'm going to replace this word with the word send great that's what we have here I have a full screen this looks freaking great looks amazing okay but we still need to make it look better so let's go ahead and do that now so I'm gonna go and create a new component okay the one that we called social actions all right so let's go all the way to the top okay so right underneath so right underneath social accounts I'm going to make a new component called social action so I'm going to wrap all these buttons inside of social actions okay so let's go ahead and do that so I'll go social um let's do it like this social actions let's copy that and let's go right outside of this and paste it so all the stuff that we added let's put it inside of social actions like so okay now it's gonna complain hey I don't know but this thing is all good let's go and do and uh and describe the style component so we'll do con social actions is equal to and I want to do styled div a okay refresh here we go they're right there okay and now let's go ahead and do the following let's go align items and I'm gonna align them centrally cool display Flex because I like enabling Flex mode on here right I'm gonna give it a margin of zero Min height of 40 pixels there we go let's give it a little padding for by eight pixels like that and then I'm going to make a button appear on this or style button not make a button appear on this what the heck am I talking about and let's do inline Flex on this thing great let's align these items centrally cool padding let's go eight pixels looking great okay give it a little blue so now they actually look very clickable and then um I want to add a media query but only 2D buttons okay nothing else so I'm going to do the following let's add our media query and I'm going to say Min with so this is going to be the other way this is going to say only do this on desktop mode so you're not going to see anything change right now okay this is saying only on desktop only on something bigger than a mobile device that's what that means it's the inverse of Max width and I'm going to say give it a margin left of 8 pixels okay you're not going to see a difference but let's go full screen here all right and so you see the like icon and you see the distance between the like emoji and the and the like text all right now on the actual mobile device they're much closer together okay if I actually comment this line out and we full screen it notice that they're much closer together okay so that difference only takes place on a desktop great so so far so good you should be up to Here and Now our posts are starting to take shape and we are liking it all right you dirty boys and girls let's keep rocking and rolling so we're having fun so far having fun so far you're enjoying yourself but now we're gonna do redones and that's gonna slap you in the face fun time is over get ready to get spanked actually you might like Redux okay so hang in there and enjoy it with me come on let's go so let's get to the Redux part okay so first things first we gotta install Redux how do we do that command J open the command line okay and um what I'm gonna do is just for a second I'm gonna stop my server by doing control C okay um on Windows it might be something else but just control C should work all right and I will simply do yarn add you can do npm install okay it's the same thing yarn add and I'm gonna do react Redux like so and I'm going to hit enter and so now it's going to install react Redux and then I'm gonna also install just Redux by itself yarn add and we're going to do Redux like so so go ahead and install both of those beautiful packages my beautiful person okay great now that that's done we're gonna go ahead and wrap the entire app in a Redux store so let's go to index.js okay and um simply go at the top and right underneath here we're going to do the following I'm going to import provider prover provider from react Redux cool and then the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to import store from store okay um yeah so we have to still of course create a store which we're gonna do soon all right so don't freak out but we're gonna be creating a store soon okay but yeah this is what all I want you to add for now and then let's go underneath and what I'm gonna do is a few things instead of right underneath so this app here right we want to wrap this app inside of our provider now okay so let's go provider and store and we're going to give it our store that we have okay and uh wrap the app inside of that provider that's all cool that's all cool if you try to run your app right now and you're running into an error don't worry it's because we haven't made the store file yet okay so we're gonna go ahead and make that store file so let's go ahead and do that all right so uh let's go to our reducers and let's make the reducers first okay so I'm gonna go ahead and make a reducer let's do it like this so in my source I'm going to create a new folder and it's going to be called reducers okay and inside of reducers what I'm going to do is I'm going to make index.js okay great and um what all I'm going to do here is I'm going to say import combine reducers okay and we're going to import that from Redux and let's also do import user reducer from whoops user reducer like this and I'm going to say make root reducer equal to combined reducers that's a cool thing about some of the Redux stuff that we're doing okay and we're going to say user reducer like that okay so this is going to allow us to combine the reducer so it's going to be helpful now let's make another file inside of our reducers folder and this is going to be called user reducer like this okay so let's go inside of our user reducer and we're gonna do we're gonna initialize the initial state in here and uh we'll simply make the initial state to be where user is null he's empty or she okay and then we're gonna say user reducer is going to be whatever um in this case the initial state so the by default if you don't pass in anything it's just going to be the initial State and it's also going to take in an action and we're going to do a switch depending on the action type uh default however will be just the thing that Returns the state okay so if I get so here's how this reducer I think about it right user reducer anytime there's a reducer how I think about it really it should be called in my mind a state updater because all a reducer does is it updates a given state so for example if we gave it some type of state it would update it okay otherwise it would just return the existing state so here's just a dumb example if I gave it an array um with an action of um you know if I gave it something with the action of like it'll send a payload and it will hit like here and it will increment it by one okay that's where the switch case will come in okay is the switch case like all right then do the following action where we increment like by one is the switch action type comment uh well then in that case in increment the comment section by one if it's none of those well the default should be hey just return the actual State don't really do anything okay so that's kind of what's happening at a high level all right so now we have both of these made now let's go ahead and of course create our store okay and uh we are going to add our store um we're going to add our store let me actually just see this real quick all right so let's go inside of our um source and in our source we're gonna create a new folder okay and we're just going to call that folder store okay and inside of store I'm going to create a new file and this will be called index.js within this file we're going to do a couple of things we're going to create store and we're going to apply some middleware uh did I write it correctly and then remove it yes knowing me probably did something silly like that apply middleware and of course let's bring it from Redux okay import root reducer from reducers okay and now let's just Define our store and once we do this we're not going to have errors anymore in our app and our app should start uh running okay great so now store is defined we are also exporting store now that we're exporting store we will have access to it inside of our project and in our index.js if I go here we are importing that store and then we're passing it to our provider so technically looking at this we should not have any more errors if you do npm start in my case I'm going to do yarn start you should not have um errors on this thing okay so let me refresh okay so it's saying does not contain a default export and what does not contain a default export it is complaining about what is it complaining about attempted import error dot dot slash reducer does not contain a default export cool so let's go to some of our reducer files and let's see if we're exporting what we want to be exporting ah looks like we're not okay so in our user reducer we're gonna just simply do export default thank you and I'm going to say user reducer or wait am I in user user right now no I'm not I'm an index.js so here we have root reducer so I need to be yeah that would make sense so let's export the root reducer and let's go into our user reducer and let's go and Export default user reducer now we should be uh getting both of those did I misspell int yes I did initial should not be spelled in tissue should be spelled initial so initial is now defined cool now that was just set up okay of Redux and uh there's a pretty good start to it and we're making good progress let's keep going all right guys so just a little note this that you're gonna build is gonna be an example without using Redux toolkit so we wanted to show you what life looks like without toolkit Redux is much harder with that Redux toolkit if you built our Disney plus clone you would have noticed things were much simpler with Redux toolkit it's going to be a little bit harder but I think it's important for you to know this because you might go to a company that's not using the Redux toolkit yet so let's go all right so let's go and now start working on the log in functionality okay so I'm gonna go ahead to my login component do we have one yet actually we don't so let's go ahead and start working on that component now okay so inside of our components oh we do we do my bad cool so inside of our login component we're gonna do a couple of things okay let's go all the way at the end where we're exporting default login um we're not going to need that okay so let's remove that for now actually just leave that for now so we don't have an error but we'll delete that later okay and at the top what I'm gonna do is let's go import connect from react Redux like so okay and uh let's keep going down and what we're going to do here is now we're going to create a map state to props okay that's another one of the annoying things that we had to do before we got Redux toolkit okay but I'll show you how this works as well boom we'll leave that as empty and then we'll also do map dispatch to props okay and then let's go ahead and do this cool okay again just hang in with me I promise the more you do repetition of building things with Redux some more is going to start to make sense but it's kind of like one of those things that you kind of get the AHA moments all at once and also pattern recognition is key key key to understanding these things okay so don't get discouraged the first time you see this because it's gonna freak you out now let's go export default and I'm gonna do export default connect and we're going to do map state to props and I'm going to do map dispatch to props to props like that okay and then I'm also going to do login like this okay so freaking weird right but there we go okay that is gonna allow us to export login as well cool okay so we're good so far now what we need to do is we actually need to start installing a couple of things all right now let's go ahead and start installing a couple of other things we're going to need so we're going to need Redux thunk and we're gonna need a Firebase okay so let's go ahead and install these things now so I'm going to hit I'm going to click on my command line I'm going to hit Ctrl C to stop the server now hit enter just a couple of times and then I'm just going to do yarn add again you can do npm install but I'm just going to do yarn add and I'll do Firebase like so so now start installing Firebase and once that's done we're going to install something else okay we're gonna install Firebase tools because you're going to need those so I'm going to do yarn add Firebase tools that's the second thing you're going to need to install and then after that we're going to need one more thing to install all right now and then last one we're going to need is yarn add and I'm going to do Redux thunk Redux Dash thunk okay so we're gonna make sure that we have that so those are the three things we're gonna install make sure you don't miss on any of these because these are going to be important okay and then of course we're gonna need access to our Firebase config files so let's go ahead and get them now all right now so here's what I want you to do go to Firebase okay firebase.com so let's just go together firebase.com like so hit um here I'm just gonna go to the email that I prefer and then hit go to console okay and here you're gonna see all these clones uh free I mean you might not see any of them this is my Firebase so for you you might have to do add project okay and you might want to do LinkedIn clone I'm just gonna call It Dummy clone but you should call it LinkedIn clone like this okay so dummy Linked In clone like so hit continue um you don't need anything else and then they'll say creating your project and that's good okay that's kind of what you want and I'll show you what you need to do after that looks so beautiful right look at that UI beautiful just circling around all right so let's hit continue on that thing and then let's keep on rocking and rolling um okay so I already have a project created so I'm gonna get out of this one now and I'm gonna go to the other project that I have okay so I'm gonna switch to my LinkedIn clone you just stay in that exact one okay and here I'm gonna pull go to Project settings okay and we're gonna get the things that we need here so go all the way to Firebase SDK snippet click config and then get all of the details for your app that you need okay so I'm just gonna copy all of these details copy let's go back to our app okay and let's start working on our app so what I'm going to do now all right and just in case you were not able to find this code right let's kind of walk through it together so I'm gonna switch to my clone the the dummy one that I was building alongside with you okay and now it might say there are no apps in your project so what I want you to do is click that code button right here go ahead and do that now and now inside of here just call it the same thing we could call it LinkedIn Dash clone okay and then just hit Register App for now okay and now it's gonna give you all of the code that you need okay so then just simply grab grab don't grab the script tags but you can just grab everything that's inside of that like VAR okay and just copy it cool great so that's all you need to do on your end all right I'm going to switch back to my other project that I had made and I'm gonna grab everything from there all right now what I want you to do is go ahead inside of your source and right click on your Source folder and make a new file and I'm going to call it firebase.js okay and inside of here I want you to do import Firebase from Firebase like that and then just go ahead and paste your config okay and in your config you should have the API key you should have the auth domain project ID storage bucket messaging sender ID app ID and measurement ID okay and it should be called const Firebase config like that cool now I'm going to just do a couple of things after this so Firebase app and I'm going to initialize this app like this and pass in the Firebase config cool that'll help initialize your app now let's connect your Firebase to your database so let's do Firebase app.firestore okay and let's do const auth actually you know what I'll build mine from scratch with you guys okay so let's let's go to my dummy version here okay and I'll just build this out with you guys because I think that's going to be the best way for you guys to pick this up so let's hit save cool now you and I are gonna be on the same page okay I don't have any unfair Advantage Okay so firestore cons OS um okay this is what we're gonna need this for authentication later let's add that provider newfirebase dot auth dot Google auth provider okay and then let's do storage firebase.storage okay because we need to store our images somewhere all right so that's what we're going to be using storage for and now let's export some of these things so we have access to them outside of here okay and then export default database because we're going to need access to the database as well so this is what your overall Firebase file should be looking like this is going to be very important for all your Firebase uh stuff so make sure that you don't have some funny weird stuff going on here okay all right now let's go inside of our index.js which is inside of our store okay so we have bunch of index.jss now but go inside of your store click on that index.js okay and uh here's the here's what we're gonna do okay now we're gonna add a couple of things to our store okay so let's Hey where's my okay that line was just too far away for me to see let's do import thunk middleware okay from Redux thunk and um also what we're gonna do is now we're gonna start applying the middleware so I'm going to remove this I'm going to say apply middleware and I'm going to pass in sunk middleware like so and we're just going to close that paren and that's it okay that's the change that we're making here so we should be we should be good for now and now what we want to do is like continue adding in the login functionality okay so we're going to now add a couple of more things to our login okay beautiful you're freaking crushing it let's keep on going so we got this now let's make the login functionality work okay and what do I mean by that here's what I mean by that let's if we go to our finalized LinkedIn clone app if I sign out here look what happens if I hit sign in with Google boom right so this popup how is it happening how's that information being stored we're gonna do that and resolve that with Redux okay and Firebase so let's go ahead and work on that functionality now so first things first which one should I work on first let me think okay let's go to Let's actually do this okay so in our source let's make a new folder and we're going to call it actions okay for Redux you have your actions you have your reducers you need all these things okay and uh it's good to put them in different folders so inside of this actions we're going to create a index.js cool and uh in here we're going to import a couple of things I'm going to import auth and I'm going to import provider and um we're gonna get this from Firebase okay and then let's do export function because we're going to need to export this anyway so let's go sign in API that's what it's going to be called and what it's going to do is going to dispatch um auth okay and we're going to do sign in with popup so this is a nice function that comes with Firebase okay so this auth right here is coming from Firebase so sign in with popup like that okay so sign in with popup once Firebase responds with the promise we're going to do dot then okay so we're gonna chain it and we're gonna pass it a payload payload like so oops boom and then inside here I'm just gonna console log the payload okay so we're gonna be able to see that great now let's go here and I'm gonna do dot catch and let's catch any errors that we're getting and then I'm just simply going to alert us of the error message okay so this is what your index.js file should look like right about now okay and now let's go ahead and put it to use all right so now let's go to our login component where we're actually going to use this sign in thing okay so login dot JS and uh let's start with importing that little method that we made sign in API if from that okay so that'll import it and now what we're going to do is inside a form where we had Google form now all we're going to do to this component and we're going to say hey on click we want you to do something here's what we want you to do we want you to run that function so we're just going to do props.sign in okay that's it okay so let's go ahead and do this okay and we're gonna go down and this is where Redux gets funky but just hang in there with me okay and I'll show you how we do this so all the way at the end right here for the Redux portion we're gonna add this kind of right below our export default and let's go ahead and do map dispatch to props actually we're doing that already so let's just stay in here boom right there okay dispatch and this is the code so let's hit enter and get inside of here and we're going to say sign in okay and what that's going to do is that's going to dispatch our method sign in API okay so this sign in here right corresponds to where we're doing props.signin okay so now those things are connected and again think of Redux Like This Global store okay where when the user logs in it passes the user login information and stores it there on the front end it's kind of like having a database on the front end that you can access really really fast that's how I think about Redux and State Management tools all right awesome so now we got all of this that's looking good now let's actually start dispatching these actions um to the stores after integrating it with Google auth so we're going to start adding the Google Google auth into uh integration very very soon okay so first of all here's what I want to do let me go to my Firebase okay and uh what I'm going to do to my Firebase is let's go to authentication inside of my Firebase and under my authentication so let's go to our Firebase app and then inside of our app what we're going to do is uh let's go ahead to our authentication and then just go and click get started cool now inside of get started what we're going to do is hit where it says Google for provider and just hit enable and that's essentially it okay just give it your email whatever your email wait give me a weird email but whatever that should be good okay so now your Google should be enabled another weird uh thing uh by the way is if you are on some type of different Firebase website there you might have uh you might not see what I see here you might see something completely different so what you want to do in that case is actually you want to hit where it says build okay for some of you might say build click that and then click authentication underneath that that'll bring you to your authentication okay okay so now let's go ahead and start trying things and trying to break through things and let's see what happens okay so I'm gonna go to my actual app and on my app instead of home let's delete that and let's just go to the you know localhost 3000 now it's might say the site can't be reached well no problem I'm just gonna hit yarn start you can in your terminal hit npm start and you should be good to go okay so now uh we're gonna click uh oh my middleware is not defined oh okay interesting so let's go to my store my index.js inside of my store okay and in here I'm probably capitalizing it somewhere middleware and let's make it lowercase okay all right there we go all right I'm sorry Frankie Frankie's building it out with me to help test it by the way shout out to Frankie guys Frankie's been here Frankie popping Frankie's been here and Tess running and doing the entire build actually with us so he can make sure that this is actually running perfectly for you guys okay so drop some love for Frankie in the comments below cool let's keep going now let's hit sign in with Google and Frankie says it's working for him oh it's working that's cool right that's so freaking cool let's set content cleverprogrammer.com nice okay great so let's open up inspect and let's see if the payload is inside of our console and it looks like it is okay so hit inspect go to console and do you see where it says object now click the drop down on the object so you guys should see user right here Okay now click under user did you uh did you click the drop down now keep scrolling down and you'll actually see display name you'll see email and you'll see email verified yeah okay great and if you keep scrolling down you'll actually even see things like Photo URL do you see that now if you double click into the photo URL um actually can I select that copies so right click and copy string okay and now open a new tab and paste that string you should see your photo like this okay and that should tell you that your um your app is like actually pulling the payload from the sign in right so like where is that payload statement let's just go ahead and search let's go console there's like only one place we're actually doing console log um and it's inside of our uh oops not mean to do that we're doing this inside of our user reducer it seems like no no I'm sorry why am I I'm being freaking crazy we're it's what's right here not inside of our user user we're using it inside of our actions index.js and we're console logging so the payload is actually what Firebase gives us back it's this object that's the payload that gets dropped uh every time we log in so we'll be able to use that payload to pull the photo and pull the name and email and all of that good stuff okay so granted we're able to get everything that we need right granted we're able to get everything that we're looking for we still need a way to actually store that information right we still need a way to store that information so that's what we're gonna do and web the website and things still need to change uh based on the user logging in okay because it shouldn't keep saying sign in with Google the whole time that would not make sense all right so let's go ahead and start setting things up so first thing I'm going to do is inside of actions I'm going to make a new file and this file is going to be called action type.js okay and I'm going to do something very simple I'm just going to say export const set user equals set user okay that's all set user equals string set user that's it all right now let's go inside of let's see which file should I work on first let's go ahead inside of our user reducer now okay that's inside of our reducer so for example just click reducer then go to user reducer you should be there now we're gonna do a couple of things here inside of our switch case so depending on what type of action we get so if we get a case where we're setting a user what we're going to do is we're going to return whatever the state was previously and then add in our new user okay so the state is going to be updated just by one thing now it's complaining hey use uh set user is not defined well no worries let's go all the way at the top and let's import it so import set user okay from foreign type like that cool so now it won't be giving us an error anymore our app should actually be working so we're good with the user reducer for now now let's go inside of our index.js all right and now let's go to our index.js okay and in our index.js all I'm going to do and sorry wrong index.js my bad let's go inside of our actions index.js right here and now all I want to do inside of my payload instead of using console.log we're going to dispatch the user dispatch means send that information out shoot it okay whenever I think dispatch I think of like the Olympics um um what is it called referee shooting gun right so it's like whenever the starting pistol no not that that's like two of crazy starting pistol okay holy crap this just got crazy uh Sprint Jesus that's what I think of whenever I think of dispatching actions so like whenever we dispatch actions from the stores like like tell the entire store we're where um the user has logged in okay man got crazy so this is who you are when you're dispatching actions is this an actual gun I don't know if they have they don't have real guns right at the Olympics okay so let's go inside so in our index.js here now let's just make a couple of changes okay first of all we're gonna import from the top import set user like so and I'm going to do from action type okay that's good now let's also export cons set user this is going to help us set the user and it's going to take in a payload whoops it's going to take in a payload and that's going to be type set user and then the user is gonna be the payload okay whatever the payload is gonna be cool all right so that's good import is looking fresh and now we're just gonna dispatch the action here instead of console logging it's a dispatch set user and payload user just like so okay save okay so now with all three of those things done hopefully that information is actually being stored inside of Redux let's hit sign in with Google and I'm gonna go ahead and sign in cool so we'll be able to see later if this information is actually being stored or not all right so now let's redirect our user to home page on login so I'm going to go to login and inside of my container right at the beginning here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna say the following I'm gonna say hey if we got a user going on okay then what I want you to do is I want you to redirect to okay and what we'll do is uh let me write redirect and hit enter so I'll import it from react router okay importing that from react router just like that cool and what I will say is redirect me to the home page cool now let's end that bad boy like that beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful very very clean line and it says hey if the user is there redirect me now all we need to do to make this magic work is let's go all the way to the bottom and um what I'm gonna do is right above map dispatch to props let's just add it here actually inside of map state to props we can do this okay we can do this right here so where it says return which is empty we're going to say user state to state dot userstate dot user so that's who the user is going to be and look at that it is already redirecting us how freaking cool is that you fools if I go to home page okay let's hit sign in with Google hopefully it works let's see hopefully it breaks and breaks my heart whoa whoa smash the like button if you enjoyed that one that was really clean okay I'm loving this man are you guys loving this I hope you're loving this okay this is awesome all right now Redux is kind of crazy so before we move on I just want to explain some of this stuff here okay so let's go back to our home page or not our homepage but our login page right this signin popup this just this one line of code makes that popup happen that is insane okay so that's just that one line of code that's making that popup happen then this line of code is telling the app hey this is the user information so I'm dispatching this action when I dispatch this action I sended this function called set user okay and I give it the payload of the user so remember what is payload.user do you guys remember that when I did um let's actually do this right now so I'm going to console log console log and I'm just going to do payload here okay and what I'm going to do here is comment this line out and let's hit refresh now I'm going to hit sign in with Google and let's hit inspect okay on the right hand side and I'm gonna go to whoops not sources console okay and I'm gonna click sign in right there now an object just appeared okay and it's giving me this information about the user okay now the user information is the one I want right so now watch this now I'm gonna do payload dot what user right so now watch what happens if I hit save and I hit uh refresh okay and let's go sign in with Google and I'm gonna hit Causey cleverprogrammer.com I'm just gonna get the information pertaining to the user that's it so I'm not meeting my display name and I'm getting my email and I'm getting all of that right so that's what payload.user actually is so that object we're sending over to this method over here that's a set user so set user takes a payload the payload was all of the user details now this is typeset user and user we set it to whatever the payload was okay that's kind of what's Happening um that's kind of what's Happening Here okay and let's go to set user boom okay this is it's all freaking connected okay now if I go inside of my reducers and I go inside of my user reducers when it sees the case that I'm trying to set the user it takes my existing state and it just adds the new user to it and if the state doesn't change it just Returns the default state of whatever it was before that user was there that's it okay and remember Redux is immutable so I'm not mutating this okay I'm creating a brand new state with whatever the previous state was along with the new one user that I've added okay so a little bit of just explaining behind the scenes of what's happening with Redux so now what we're going to do is we're going to take the user authentication info when the authentication is changed okay and store it okay so for example when I log in I want to like store that information and have access to it okay anytime I'm like refreshing or getting that information so let's go ahead and work on that now so inside of my actions and index.js what I will do underneath here is uh let's make another function okay and let's call it user auth like so get user auth okay this is what's going to get the authentication info and uh let's start it off with dispatch cool and I'm gonna do this is something that comes from Firebase so on off stay changed do me a favor and run this asynchronously okay you're going to take a user as an input and if user meaning if the user exists or is logged in or whatever dispatch set the user set the user to user okay so that looks good now let's go inside of our app uh JS file and we're going to add all of this here so um let's go ahead and do that okay so first of all I'm gonna need to I'm going to need to do a couple of things and for those things we're gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna kind of walk you through all of this okay so first of all right at the start here okay function app um let me think let's have it and take props like that okay and then inside of here I'm actually gonna throw in my use effect uh hook so let's go use effect and uh let's hit enter whoops use effect okay there's tons of boilerplate that comes uh with a lot of this stuff but okay so use effect this is how we write it in here okay so I'm going to say props Dot get user auth cool and then here it's not going to really have any dependencies for now cool okay so now it's gonna start telling us hey we're erroring out so let's go ahead and import react hooks so import use effect like so all right so that's now going to import this use effect good use effect does not define interesting should be defined okay so now it's saying get user auth is not a function so we're going to go ahead and import that as well import get user auth okay from actions okay so now we got that as well it's good cool so now of course it's saying it's not a function but we're going to go ahead and take care of that okay so let's go ahead inside um you know just get inside of app.js hopefully you're there and now let's go all the way to the bottom and we're going to need to do those map to props type of things okay this is very common thing we have to do with the Redux if you're using it without toolkit it's annoying but has to be done okay so we're gonna do that now right after take out this fat ass wallet from my pocket so let's go ahead and do this the map state to props like so and we're going to do state and let's go like this and we're going to return squigglies like that okay then let's do const map dispatch to props okay we're gonna do this is gonna take in something to dispatch and uh get user auth and this is actually what's going to start defining your function okay and we're going to say dispatch get user auth function okay and then what we're going to do is I'm going to remove this export default line we're going to export default I'm going to say connect okay we're also going to need access to this connect we're going to import it later I'm going to do map state to props and I'm going to do map dispatch to props and then let's just do app okay now we're gonna need to import connect so let's go ahead and import connect um from Redux okay import connect my bad from from react Redux cool so that's imported now what's the error let's see identifier connect has already been declared oh my bad I'm declaring uh getting it too many times it's already right here cool we got connect now it's your expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression line 37 and 16. cool so let's see okay let's wrap that in parentheses so it's an expression okay don't need that there okay so now that should be good should be good should be good that allows us to get the user info hopefully they're not getting any errors and now we are on the same page beautiful okay so the other annoying thing that I realize guys is um remember my image was not showing up the jobs add one or whatever this one just kept not showing up I looked at my console and it was getting blocked by client for whatever reason so what I decided to go ahead do is like copy that image and open a copy link address open that right here right and then what what you can do if you're having the same problems hit save image as okay and go to that same folder you have everything right so for example for me GitHub Banger projects LinkedIn clone uh public images inside of that images folder I just decided to call it jobs ad.jpg okay um and then I hit save so then it showed up as an image right there okay and then I went to my right side component because that's where it was supposed to show up and it just was like never showing up okay so in the right side component in order for it to show what I did is I went to my banner card and um instead of having that static link I just changed it with the actual image okay so how you can do that is simply go and select this slash Images slash jobs at jpeg hit save and then uh this is what you should see okay so go ahead and do that that'll take care of that other problem that we were having earlier okay and so if somebody wants to be helpful please drop the time stamp to when this problem was first introduced okay and then um you know and just say this is the bug fix for that so if somebody's looking for it that'll be really really helpful thank you now let's go ahead and display the user photo once the user is logged in so I'm going to go inside of headerjs and let's go to where we have user which is user component okay so this user component right here okay so where that says me we're going to replace that with an image of me okay the image that I get from Google authentication all right so here's how that's gonna go I'm gonna go right underneath this a tag cool and uh right underneath this a tag what I'm gonna do is open up your squiggly okay and um let's be careful where we put everything okay so squiggly let's do it this way I'm in the wrong place okay remove that quickly and remove that a needs to be inside of user okay what did I do what did I do I'm sorry I'm confusing you okay leave work alone leave work alone so it should have that a tag in there you're good you don't need to touch work we're trying to touch user I don't know why I decided to go under work probably I've just been coding for so long I'm losing my eyesight a little bit so bear with me here okay I'm just a human being relax so right over here what I'm going to do is uh let's add a squiggly here okay like that okay so the squiggly opens up here but here's where we're gonna close it so remove the closing one and I'm gonna close it right above this span just like that okay that is um that is perfecto okay that's the right spot for me to close it cool so now let's go ahead and make this work so inside of this squiggly we're gonna do a couple of things okay I'm gonna say props dot user so if the user is logged in and exists I want the following to happen props.user.photo URL okay so if that URL exists then I want um the following to happen okay so I'm going to make an image tag here and in this image tag for source what I'm going to say is this okay and you can remove the quotes because this is going to evaluate to a string anywhere once it's done so I'm going to say props dot user.photo URL okay and let's end that cool and then I'm going to say colon so like this okay now this looks really intimidating and confusing but let me explain first hey is the user logged in yes they are they exist great then look for their photo URL does that exist question mark if it exists then show their photo then I have this ternary operator right there if it doesn't exist show a generic user photo capiche that's what's happening there another thing why my thing looks funny why my this me part with the drop down sign looks funny is because the drop down is not inside of the span so let's go ahead and uh close that and sandwich that in the span okay so again span should have the word me in it and the drop down image in it okay so make sure to go ahead and do that and once you do that what's gonna happen is now your photo and your me with the drop down looks freaking great okay that's what should happen alright so that's looking good now what we need to do is make sure our dispatch is happening because right now um our app does not know about the image so it needs access to the store and we need to dispatch that action okay so then it's going to have access to the photo so anyways long story short let's go all the way to the bottom and let's go ahead and do map state to props like so state whoops okay state and then inside of here we're going to return user state.user state DOT user and knowing boilerplate code okay that's map state to props now we also need map dispatch to props and let's go dispatch like this let's leave it empty for now we don't really have anything going on in here just yet and then this last line where it says export default header remove that line so we're going to delete that line and we're just going to do export default connect and you guys know the drill we're going to connect map state to props like so then we're going to do map dispatch to props and then we're gonna do header like this okie dokie Mr Pokey okay so that is pretty good for now let me actually just see if we need to change any additional things at the top should we import connect yes we did import connect so that's looking good so far okay great so it is working uh in order to be able to see it first of all it's at the bottom right you should be seeing your logged in photo because I'm logged in and you should be seeing your logged in photo at the bottom right if you're logged in and at the top right you should actually be seeing it if in desktop mode okay so you should be seeing your photo cool amazing okay now what we want to do is uh add the ability to sign out so when I hover over assign um me right if I hit sign out I cannot sign out so let's add that ability so um let's go and start off bye first of all inside of actions we're now going to create a new file actually no let's not create a new file let's just go inside of our index.js so in here remember we added the sign in functionality and the get user auth functionality so let's go underneath that and let's add the sign out functionality now so let's do export function sign out API okay and then let's do return dispatch just like this all right inside of this dispatch all we're going to do is uh we're gonna do auths.sign out and again this comes built in with Firebase okay that's why Firebase is so nice and then we're going to dot then okay leave that empty and we're going to do dispatch set user to null okay so we're going to run that function we're going to set the user to null okay that's going to remove any user that's existing and then I'm going to do that catch any errors um and if there are any errors just simply console log them in this case great so this is what your sign out API should be looking like right now okay so continuing on with our functionality now we're gonna do just a few things okay so let's go to our um when we sign out so let's think about this right when we sign out we need to be redirected back to the home page right just like when we sign in we need to be redirected back let me fix that when we sign out we need to be redirected to the login page just like when we sign in we're redirected to the home page okay so we're gonna work on that um that was Nas say hi to NAS everybody behind me beautiful so we're going to add that redirect in just a second but first let's start off with the functionality so I'm going to go to my header okay and let's first of all import the sign out functionality that we made okay so let's import sign out API okay and where are we gonna import that from well you know where we're going to import that from from our actions where we just finished making it okay in the index.js so now this will actually import it okay why is saying module is not found dot slash actions oh my bad dot dot slash actions there we go okay because I'm inside of headers which is inside of components so I need to back out first and then I have access to this actions folder okay gotta back out then boom hence the two dots right there cool okay so now inside of my sign out let's find that so sign out is right there and uh to just sign out all I'm going to say is they on click I want you to do something for me okay and sign out it's gonna be like hey what do you want me to do well on click um I want to actually sign out okay I want to call the sign out method now remember because we're using Redux you can't just normally make this work because that would make too much sense unfortunately so in Redux you do things always in a really obnoxious boilerplate method thank you Dan abramov and the founder of Redux so I'm gonna go to my dispatch to props and in here all I'm gonna do is we're gonna add in sign out and what signout is going to do is dispatch and we're going to use our method that we created earlier dispatch sign out API okay so that should already be pretty good okay so let's go ahead and see if that does anything or not so sign out whoa it actually worked did you guys see the photo change that's freaking amazing so let's actually go back to our home page and let's test this out let's hit sign in and it should redirect us to the home page when I sign in so boom let me choose my email okay it redirected me and look my photo is of the logged in user that photo is being pulled straight from Firebase now if I hover over and click sign out it signed me out and the photo is gone but what should happen when I sign out I need to be redirected back to the login page so let's just go ahead and add that last bit of functionality and how we're going to do that is let's start off by going to our home page and inside of our home page I need to make sure that I import my redirect okay from react router Dom because that's what allows me to manipulate the Dom and manipulate which Pages I'm at I also need to import connect because I'm going to need that for this from react Redux and again this is Redux without toolkit okay so this is why you still have to do mappings and connects okay now inside of my container right over here here's what I'm gonna do all right we're just going to add that right there and I'm going to say hey if the user is not logged in or there is no user then what I want you to do in that case is redirect me too the home page or I'm sorry I keep saying the home page but the login page in this case okay and of course we want to close this so let's go ahead and do that Okay cool so now when I sign out it actually brings me back to the home page okay and last things I want to do in order to make sure that that happens and my store knows about it here's what I need to do because that functionality is still not necessarily working we're going to do map state to props and I'm going to let the state know about hey user update the user State like so and I'm going to delete this line and we're going to do export default and this is what we've been doing with Redux every single time so connect and map state to props and we're just going to leave it to that because we don't need to dispatch any actions in this case and of course at home just like this okay so now refresh so now watch what happens okay I'm gonna sign in with Google now it should update my photo at the bottom right now let me full screen it real quick full screen hover over let's click sign out and boom that works that is nice right when I sign out it actually brings me back straight to the home page okay so hopefully you're enjoying this so far and now we're gonna start displaying the username right next to um right next to our user profile okay user image all right so here we go so now we're gonna actually add the user display username on the left hand side okay so um and we're gonna do that right there okay where it says welcome rafikaze that's kind of what we're gonna do in our own app okay so first of all just let's just log in so it redirects us to the home page beautiful that looks good okay but now it says welcome there well it should know who we are so it shouldn't say there it should actually say our name now so let's go ahead and do that so I'm gonna go to my left side component that I have and then where we have this link this is where we need to change it okay and here's how we're going to do that so I'm going to say it props that User it's going to get me access to the user and remember display name this is what should get me access to the name um so what I'm going to do is I'm going to basically be like hey if the user exists Okay so props.user if the user exists this is a nice fancy ternary operator that says then show me the username otherwise show me blank okay or I can just say show me well uh there okay so that way it says there for now and then if the user will be there it'll say their name instead cool well why is it not getting the name you might ask well what we're gonna have to do is tell Redux about it so this is where we need to map state to props so let's do cons map state to props like this open this bad boy up and again we're going to return user state DOT user state dot user like this okay let's refresh okay and we're gonna go ahead and connect it now to our component all right so let's go here boom import connect like this from react Redux so now we have this imported that's great let's go all the way down there's a lot of lines of code in there remove this and we're going to do export default connect map state to props and we'll just do left side like this okay again we're not doing any dispatching here we're only doing reading and retrieving all right so now rafikaze is being read hey that's amazing right let me go home rafikaze if I log out it should basically be uh nobody okay cool slash home doesn't even let me go to home okay when I log in it lets me go to home so that's really good my authentication it seems like it's working really well and things are good now we're going to start working on the modal okay so let's go ahead to main.js file and instead of post Malone we're going to be working on post modal huh so congratulations all right post modal there we go you like that one nice all right and uh pretty much what I'm gonna do is right underneath where article is ending and there's a div ending right underneath the article let's go underneath that div and I'm going to add the post modal okay and you'll be like hey Kazi hey Kazi were you importing the pulse model from that's a really good question it doesn't exist yet so we need to go ahead and make it so inside of components I'm going to create a new file it's going to be called postmodal.js okay and now we're going to start working on this model and it's going to be nice so let's start off with styled from style components because we're going to need to style this thing and of course let's go ahead and go it's gonna get some props okay there's as arguments and um I'm gonna create a new component inside of here it's going to be a container and I'm just going to say pulse modal for now let's hit refresh it's still complaining well that's because I have to export default post modal and now it should stop complaining soon okay it goes hey I don't know what container is no worries I'm going to const container and let's actually go styled div and leave it as an empty cool so now all the errors are gone and we're back to an operational app which is exactly what we want now inside of our container we're going to style it so I'm going to say position position fixed okay where is our model I'll show you our model will be available for us shortly okay let's go top zero for the modal let's go left zero okay and um we're gonna start seeing it soon hopefully I'm as surprised as you when we see it just kidding all right bottom zero okay so that allows us to put it at the top we're gonna give it a really high Z index okay so you just kind of you can kind of do that that will make sure that it's always on top of things so now you're starting to see it post modal okay and now zero zero zero zero it means zero on the left axis xaxis yaxis and uh that's what you end up getting when you go zero zero so what this does here by the way right is this zero zero zero you're wondering what it does so hit come here and inspect the element now when I inspect it look the modal is actually over the entire screen okay and uh if I actually change this to 10 pixels or let's go 50 pixels so something visible from the top it's pushing it down but notice now it's not the entire screen so why we do that sometimes zero zero zero zero like that is to kind of in an easy way say hey take over the entire browser okay so this right now is taking over the entire browser and it has a massive Z index so it'll also take over more priority cool so now inside of color I'm going to give it color black and just to kind of show you this right if I actually gave it a background color of let's say black Watch What Happens boom my entire screen is now gone black okay and if I give it a z index of negative 20 now it's hiding behind but you can still see the little black bars on the side okay so that's the index just to make sure that always stays on top of everything else and instead of black of course it's a crazy color to give it right now um we're going to just give it um 0.8 just like this okay that's what's going to happen when the modal opens that's what's going to happen to the entire screen that's what we want okay so then we can see the modal easily so that's how we make that happen cool now last thing we want to do is I mean we're already exporting it and we're using it in main.js right so let's go to our main and we have pulse modal that's how we're getting this cool beautiful and make sure we're imported okay perfect good job so far let's keep rocking and rolling and now we're gonna start adding main content component inside of post modal so let's go to post model and inside of here I'm going to remove where it says post modal okay and I'm going to say content cool inside of content let's just write content for now and leave it pretty blank and we're going to add in a new styled component I'm going to say content with a style div of course empty to just start it off with and we'll give it a width of a hundred percent okay cool all right Max width will give it of 552 pixels so it will never be bigger than that we're going to give it a background color of white so now we can actually start to see this okay cool so we can see that the model is starting to become visible and now what we're going to do is let's give it a let's remove that uh let's actually keep that my bad and let's go and give it a Max height of 90 percent cool overflow will go initial okay and then let's go border radius of 5 pixels okay so now we're starting to have slightly rounded Corners right there we'll go position relative display Flex okay and now let's do Flex Direction column in this case cool well top 32 pixels that pushes it down and we're gonna go margin zero Auto okay so now we have this thing smack in the middle showing up exactly where we want it beautiful so that's all we wanted to do for this and now we're going to add header and post modal component okay so let's go and do that so inside of content I'm gonna remove content and I'm just gonna go header like this thank you cool and inside of here what I want to say is let's go in h add an H2 and we'll do create a post like that right underneath this I'll add a button and inside of this button I'm going to add an image and this image is going to be a close icon.svg okay and now the header is going to say hey I'm not defined well no problem okay and I'll show you how to add a close Icon by the way so the close icon actually is right here it looks like that little X at the top so let's go grab that close icon and drop it inside of our images now you should have access to it okay let's go back to the code that we were on inside of components postmodal.js so we added that image and now we're going to actually create styling for that component so cons header let's start right off with blank and then let's go ahead and start now styling it okay so we now see create a post so that looks pretty good display block I'm going to add padding to it boom now the padding starting to look good I'm going to add a border bottom so I'm going to add a something on the bottom and then lastly we're gonna do this clean let's give it a font size of 16 pixels I'm gonna give it a line height of 1.5 beautiful I'm going to go RGB a on this thing and let's do this cool so it's like a little grayed out now we'll do font weight 400. and then justify actually before we do that let's enable display Flex let's go justify content on this thing and we'll go space between so now that X should springboard over all the way to the right hand side I'm gonna go align item Center dope and then of course let's style the button and I'm gonna go height 40 pixels with 40 pixels great Min with Auto uh color let's do the same thing a little bit of that gray never hurt nobody cool and then SVG hey pointer events make sure that there are none pointer events are none okay cool X cool all right so now we got that big boxy looking um X in the model it's pretty good it's a good start okay let's create shared content and add user info part inside of it okay so let's go to you know we're inside of here now let's make sure content so where am I gonna do that I'm gonna let's do it right underneath this header right here shared content let's go user info let's make another component and inside of here I'm gonna go image slash Images slash user SVG okay this is just gonna be that dummy user in image and for span let's go name okay all right shared content is not defined user info is not defined you guys know the drill right you guys know what we do let's go ahead and start working on this right style div let's leave it empty for now user info style div like that oh refresh okay so now that image is showing up but it obviously looks crazy so we're gonna Now work on it let's enable display Flex to start off things are already starting to look in control display Flex is such magic Flex Direction column Flex grow one overflow y I'm gonna go Auto on this thing vertical align Baseline cool background I'm gonna do transparent okay and then of course padding eight pixels by 12 pixels beautiful great now let's inside of our user info let's go ahead and do a couple of things enable display Flex here I'm going to align my items to the center so I can see that n is in the middle but it's still behind the photo add padding 12 pixels by 24 pixels like so cool and now let's control our SVG and our images and we're going to give them the same type of styling boom boom cool background clip I'm gonna go content box okay border two pixels solid transparent border radius this is going to give it a nice little circle that we always love looking clean and then of course let's go inside of our span and now we're gonna go font wait 600 font size 16 pixels line height 1.5 cool so now the text is looking Bolder and then of course let's give it a little bit of margin because it's getting a little too close to that logo so let's push it a little bit okay beautiful so that looks great to me for shared content right this model is looking good I mean of course we still need to add functionality so when I hit X it actually goes away right and things like that so we're gonna now start adding those things in okay we also need to make sure the text editor is editable so that's going to need um you know quite a bit of work so let's work on that now all right so cool let's start working on the text editor and add in bunch of functionality so I am going to go um in I mean I'm I'm gonna just stay in my post model okay and then um let's add another component and I'm going to add it right underneath shared content so we're going to call it share creation like this and let's just type in some word in there like actions let's go all the way down and I'm going to add a component styling for this styled div hit save just so that error stops display Flex so you guys you should be able to see the actions in there now okay it should be it's right there boom cool now I'm going to do justify content space between cool and then of course padding 12 pixels 24 by 16. cool so now we just added some padding kind of everywhere from every direction so that looks that looks good now we're gonna add creation buttons okay so you might be wondering hey are you getting the creation buttons from here so we're going to have the share image okay that image right there at the top and we're also going to have that image the video image as well so share image share video I'm going to drag this into my images and drop cool so that's going to be there now let's go inside of my um right underneath share creation inside of shared creation I'm going to remove the word actions and instead I'm going to write attach assets okay and let's create a new component called attach assets okay and instead of attach assets let's create a new component called asset button like that and inside of asset button I'm going to add an image and that image is going to be Images slash share.mage.svg cool and then I'm going to have another asset button asset button and inside of that I'm going to have another image that's going to be Images slash sharevideo.svg like so cool now let's go ahead and add this so all the way at the bottom let's do const asset button is equal to styled button okay and I'm gonna do let's do display Flex on this thing um of course it's saying that error so let's actually start that styling too so we we don't have that error anymore styled div okay boom so we got the image here and then we got the video button right there okay that's what we were trying to add so now let's go here and do align items Center height will make it 40 pixels give it a Min width of Auto color I'm gonna go rgba zero zero zero zero point five okay and then under attach assets let's do a line items Center to display flex and let's go padding padding right and I'll go eight pixels on it boom okay beautiful so we got this we got the buttons and we got some styling for for this uh uh acid button at least okay so let's finish up the styling for attach Assets Now okay so I'm gonna go right here and we're gonna use the select this selector here to get our style component called asset button and we're going to style that to be with 40 pixels like this cool so now that should be good okay if I made that 100 pixels it'll be really obvious what happens so if I go 100 pixels like that you can obviously see that just buttons got really long but let's go 40 pixels and they're right there cool so that looks good and now let's add share uh comment component mouthful a little bit of a mouthful all right so let's go find this so share comment it's gonna be this one all right let's drag that into our images folder okay and then let's go to our post modal and inside of our post model let's make that work so where am I doing share comments so let's go underneath attach assets okay so let's go outside of attach assets all right let's go now share comment like that and then inside of share comment I will add um let me do it like this you could see the entire time let's just do asset button asset button like that and inside of this asset button I'm going to add an image and this image is going to be the following slash Images slash share comment dot SVG cool and then we'll just write anyone here okay so now you see this button up here but now let's wrap that new button that we made inside of share comment component okay so I'll go here go here and paste it okay so this is what it should look like share common component now it's going to complain about share comment component but you and I we don't worry about that because we know this we go ahead and create the style component like this keep it blank and then let's add some padding left okay let's go ahead and let's go and add margin right Auto cool let's go border left one pixel solid rgba this cool so now you're seeing this border right this thin little border that's being there let's go ahead make a dollar sign I'm gonna say asset button select asset button and inside of that button any svgs we have let's give it a margin right of five pixels cool so that looks good the share comment component it's kind of done now let's add the post button and how I'm going to do it is like this so let's go right underneath the share comment and let's add in the button right here okay so I'm gonna go post button and let's just say post now let's go ahead and add that to our styling so I'm going to do cons post button is equal to styled button cool so again start off with empty and now that button is there I can see it Min with 60 pixels cool border radius 20 pixels I like how it's looking padding left 16 pixels cool let's add some padding right by 16 pixels okay so now it's made it a little bit bigger background like this okay give it a little blue we'll color it white okay and then on Hover so I'll do this on Hover we're going to give it a background of that right there cool so when I hover boom just a little bit extra blue click it and I can press it okay beautiful all right so now that we added that post button let's remove the remove close button image okay and we're gonna do some stuff with being able to hide it and show it so when we hit X we want things to be able to happen Okay so let's go and work on that now okay and um I was gonna work on the text editor earlier but let's go and work on it now okay so let's go ahead and work on the text editor cool so no worries in post modal what I'm gonna do is all the way at the top okay let's go import use State like this okay let's use react States because we're gonna need to work with State now and uh let's just let's start so here I'm going to say editor text and then we're going to do set editor text so this is going to be a function that allows us to change the text all right that's kind of how you also set variables in react the react way of setting variables and we're going to start off with it being blank okay so the functionality we're working on now is this one so when I hit start a post this modal pops up the text in the start is blank and then as I start typing it it updates the text so we're going to do that in our app that's not built yet cool so let's go underneath user info okay so underneath user info I'm going to make my editor component and uh editor component is going to take in the text area actually let's before I make my editor component let's leave it blank let's start off with uh just doing text area like this um cool I'm going to remove just go ahead and remove all of this for now all right and what I will say is inside of text area let's add something for value so we're going to make value be the editor text so whatever the state of the text is okay so right now it's not really going to be doing much so when I type it doesn't do anything it just kind of freezes that's what should be happening with yours okay then after text I want to do on change I want something to happen okay and what do I want to happen on change I want to take let's go like this I'm gonna take whatever the value you're giving me and I want to set it to the editor text so I'm going to do e.target.value so whatever you're typing okay it's complaining e is not defined okay not to worry we're going to take care of that shortly okay so we have on change and we have the on change ending right there cool let's go ahead and add the placeholder as well in just a second all right just make sure you refresh as soon as you refresh you should be good to go and all that's happening is as soon as I do I type in F in the text area now it calls this on change okay it goes on change what should I do on change says hey grab the event okay what was the event I wrote this thing so now what we do is we change the editor text variable's value which was blank in the start with whatever the target value is in this case that's f so now this editor text here becomes F and then it shows F now I'm going to write f e it becomes f e it passes that here that passes that here and then that shows that there super confusing but that's what's happening okay and then if I hit post I have access to all of that information so now let's do placeholder whoops let's not do that placeholder okay and then my place was giving me what do you want to talk about cool so if you remove everything that's the that's what the placeholder will be and of course let's also do Auto Focus to be true okay so as far as my text areas can concerned that's looking good now what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to create my styled component I'm going to do this one the other way so let's go ahead and create a style component called editor and do style div okay and I'm going to and I'm going to style it in just a second let's go and add let's go and take what we created this text area and we're going to wrap this entire text area inside of our a new component called editor so make sure you cut that and you wrap the text area inside of editor just like this okay now we need to style our editor component okay great let's add some padding and I'll go 12 pixels by 24 pixels like so let's now style the text area inside of this editor let's go with 100 percent gold is Big let's give it a Min height of 100 pixels great do anything yes I made it fat which is exactly what we want and then resize none okay so now so notice this little touch right if I have resize enabled at the bottom right you see this resize and I can resize it to whatever I want right boom it's kind of weird by doing resize none it now there's nothing there's no way to resize this that's what we want let's go here and let's go input with 100 beautiful okay so whatever we're writing here input cool height of 35 pixels cool font size of 16 pixels okay all right and then right underneath it we're gonna go margin bottom 20 pixels okay great our text box looks text box looks absolutely great we're using uh state to do a bunch of stuff and that's good now again let's focus back on being able to open the modal and close the modal this is something very common that you have to do in react and we're going to start working on that now so let's go ahead and get started so where should we get started well the first thing I want to do is um inside of main I'm gonna add the ability to hide and show the modal cool so let's go all the way at the top we're going to import State because we're going to need access to it so use state and I'm going to say from react okay now underneath Main I'm gonna do show modal set show modal like this my bad use State and um default is going to be a closed State okay so by default it's going to be just always closed all right now right underneath here let's add the code to make it um hide and show the model so let's get started on that so I'm gonna do handle click and here's what we're gonna do okay so we're going to start it off by preventing the default Behavior which is important for react so you don't have these weird refreshing things going on when you don't want them okay all right let's go let's stay here outside of our if statement and now I'm gonna just add a little switch statement and I'm just going to say show modal all right and in the case that I get an open what I want you to do is the following I want you to set it to close and then break okay in the other case where it's closed then what I want you to do is I want you to show modal to be open okay and break in the case oh actually otherwise let's just do default set show model to be just closed by default okay and then we'll break right there beautiful so that seems simple enough now let's actually go to the button and add that functionality where's my button user SVG yep so start a post that's where we're gonna add it so let's go on click equals and I'm going to say handle handle click okay great and uh where I have post modal let's scroll down scroll down where I have post modal I'm gonna give it show modal pass at the current state of the modal okay so it's going to take a prop that's show modal prop and we'll add in the functionality for that prop in just a second okay and then the handle click prop it's going to just do handle click actually we're probably just taking in props so we'll probably have to do props dot show modal and props dot handle click so let's go ahead and check that out let's go to pulse modal um dope and inside of my post model I want to do just a few things so right underneath that text that we're editing let's go ahead and do the following I'm gonna do I'm going to create a reset all right and this reset is going to take in an event and it's going to set the editor text to be blank and it's also going to handle click and handle the event okay so I'm going to wrap the whole thing in a jsx fragment all the way down to this container here okay so let's just start off with that and then what I'm gonna do is I'm also going to wrap the entire thing in these squiggly brackets like this cool now within here what I'm going to say is I'm going to say props dot show model equals open if that's true then what I want you to do is show me all of this stuff here okay and what I'm going to do to my button let's go to my where is my creative post create a post right so right underneath that I have a button okay and what to that button I'm gonna do on click on click taking an event okay and call my reset function and give it my give it my event okay that's what I want to happen when I click X so now um oh also let's go all the way down and where do I have my SVG inside of my header const header where's my header styling right there let's also do comma IMG to it okay let's add an image to it as well cool let's refresh let's full screen this thing let's hit start a post ooh hit X nice look at that that worked I can't believe that worked I really thought it was gonna break boom boom look at that model and look the whole screen goes dark because that we have that you know that post modal div that takes over the entire screen when I click it when I hit X it goes and it's done okay that modal is a very beautiful functionality so great work on adding that I'm proud of you okay and if you're proud of you then smash that like button okay just for yourself if not for me I'm proud of you let's keep going now we're going to add a smooth fade that's going to fade these things out so here's how we're gonna do that let's go to pulse modal and inside of our post model let's go all the way down to container and right underneath here I'm just going to say animation fade in and let's do something like 0.3 seconds that's 300 milliseconds okay I do something I don't know that didn't do anything then we're gonna have to make it do something start a post cool let's go to our index.css and we're going to make it do something all right so I'm now in my index.css file which is of course inside of source so let me close out of my images and close out of my public close actions okay so inside of source I have index.css let's go there let's go all the way down and let's make let's make that fade in mean something and do something so I'm going to say webkit keyframes let's go fade in and what fade in his job is going to be is this from opacity of zero what we want you to do is go to an opacity of one and now we're gonna also Define standard keyframes let's remove all of this Let's do an at sign right there okay save because it's still complaining failing to compile that should be good start oh look at that fading start a post click yo that looks beautiful that is freaking beautiful that's all I gotta say that's all I gotta say all right that modal work was just beautiful okay now let's keep going beautiful so now we got that working now we're gonna disable the post button when the editor text is um empty okay because right now even when the editor text is not empty I can hit post so we don't want that we don't want that okay cool so let's go ahead to post modal and let's start adding that functionality so let's go to our post button and um inside of our post button All I'm gonna say is this I'm Gonna Save disabled okay when the editor text state is empty when it just doesn't exist okay if it's so give me true so give me disable true if the text is empty otherwise give me false cool that's essentially it cool disable old old D just like that okay so now because of the styling and stuff like that you can't really see it but it's actually disabled right now because there's no borders around it but I type the borders appear okay but it's just like a little hard to see so we're gonna go ahead and add some styling to it so let's go to our post button so I'm going to command f post button component and let's add some styling to this so inside of background here's what we're going to do we're gonna do some cool ways of styling now props dot this I'm going to do it this way okay let's go get access to the props and if the props is disabled question mark then I want you to style it in this way zero zero zero zero point eight okay and if you're not disabled then I want you to style it in a different way so like what we had earlier so now this is going to be really freaking cool whoa what the hell happened it looks ugly as hell what the heck happened we lost all of our styling oh man the app is going all over the place all right let's take that out of parentheses here um I mean it doesn't really matter but prettier wants me to do it the other way oh and why am I going blind let's um close this freaking parentheses right there right because that would only make sense and then that closes that cool ah yeah look at that okay my post is dark I write and now it's blue this is why I love styled components you guys because I'm just I'm saying if it's disabled give it this color if it's enabled give it this color and it's just so freaking nice it's just so freaking nice okay um and now I also want to change the text color Okay so let's go ahead and change the text color because right now just white that's not what we want so let's go props and I'm gonna go props disabled okay if it's disabled then do the following of course open close this okay and then outside of this just give me white okay so when it's disabled it's hard to see it when it's enabled boom okay so that's what it I want that to happen with the colors it's good it's good okay cool and then on Hover I also want to give it a dynamic functionality okay so I'm going to say props and if it's disabled again let's go ahead and do zero zero zero zero point eight like that actually let's do 0.0 zero point yeah 0.08 okay or in the other case give me this okay am I closing my parentheses right yes I am on Hover beautiful okay that's all that's happening cool so when I hover over it gives me like a lighter gray uh in the disabled mode okay and then when I write then it gives me this one when I hover over on this thing right boom boom boom beautiful that's exactly what I want and that's really really good now we're going to start adding file input for uploading images and that allows us to upload a file from our computer and add it to this and that's really nice functionality if you're going to a recruiter you can show them that functionality okay they're going to be blown away so let's go ahead and start adding that now so file input where do we start well we start in post model let's go all the way to the top and right underneath this let's go ahead and add share image set share image all right and I'm gonna go use state leave it blank cool um and then what I want to do is I want to handle the change as it happens okay we're gonna get the first element from the files and if the image is blank or image is undefined okay in those two cases I want to basically say hey uh not an image the image file is a and then we're gonna be able to access instead type of image cool so that's gonna be great if this is going to help me figure out like what the actual error is and what's the type of the image and then otherwise I'm just going to return and I'm going to return right here return cool and now right underneath that let's go set share image okay so meaning if we don't get an error then do this thing and when I do this thing it's going to update that variable right there share image cool cool cool cool beans now let's go ahead and actually add the upload image component so I'll add the upload image component uh kind of right underneath the text area all right so text area what I'm going to do is I'm going to remove this and I'm just going to end it right there so just a little bit tad bit cleaner and right underneath the text area I'm going to add the upload image component and let's just go ahead and give it a empty styling for now before we start doing other things to it upload image is equal to styled div and just leave it empty for now and that way we don't get into errors as I'm writing it so you can see it build out upload image right there and let's go input type type is going to be file so already just by doing type file for input I can now choose file and it brings up all of this stuff which is super cool all right so that's good and I can even click choose file and click an image and it automatically knows Disney plus ASMR right it says it right there so that's a really good sign so like things are already kind of working I'm gonna say accept um and let's say accept what except uh image slash GIF so accept images and GIFs and also um accept jpegs and also I'll have it except pngs okay like this so that's good your name is equal to image the ID of this will be file cool of this input and then let's give it a style and I'll give it a jsx inline styling okay and I'm going to say display um none okay so if I remove that style you see choose file if I re if I add display none now that choose file is just not showing because I I said don't display it right if I change it with something else it's going to have different Behavior cool all right so that's good now on change we need to add something that actually handles on change okay so let's go on change we're going to handle on change okay so it's going to run our handle change function we're just going to do all of this which is going to set the image for us cool cool let's so now we're closing out of that input that's good all right so that input should end right there right underneath that will add a paragraph tag and in here let's add a label okay and html4 will just be file and now let's give it a style okay again we'll also do this one inline as well for styling just please bear with me this is going to be a little hard to follow but bear with me here and I'm just going to say cursor pointer but actually you know what I don't even think we need that to be honest I'm just gonna leave that so that will make it simpler for you and then let's just say inside of the label let's just say select a image Let's do an image to share like that okay so now there is our styling very very simple okay and when I click it okay already um it actually opens this up okay so but what we have to do is probably make it look like something that you want to click on so we're gonna do that in just a second all right let's end our label we're ending our label that's good and right underneath ending our label we're ending our P tag that's good now let's right underneath our P tag but it's still inside our upload image component let's add in these squigglies and we're gonna do share image so if the image actually exists then do the following okay I'm gonna say image source is equal to and I'm going to say url.create object URL and I'm going to pass this the share image path okay like that let's close our image tag beautiful okay boom boom hey our image is showing that was nice and a lot easier to do than expected beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful that's good let's go down upload image now let's add this component styling all the way at the bottom for upload image because right now the image is ridiculous right so we're just going to need to control that so let's go text align Center and then after this so now select an image to share is looking good okay and of course now what we want to do is we're going to say hey the image let's give it a width of a hundred percent one of those so now the image is looking great wow how nice huh we got click okay let's refresh right boom let's click select an image to share pick that hit enter man that looks beautiful that looks beautiful I love it okay very very simple and very effective very very effective um now we're also gonna add a react player so then that way we're able to actually show like any video URLs that we put okay that's gonna like kind of Auto expand them and make them look great so let's go ahead and do that cool so let's start working on it now first things we need is we actually I'm going to hit Ctrl C and stop my server and what we actually need is you can do npm install like this but I'm actually going to do yarn add which is the same thing uh and I'm gonna do yarn add react dash player okay and hit enter so install um what I want you to do is install this component right now not component but uh man my brain is getting fried but yeah install this so now you should have react player okay the react player Library and let's go inside of our post model and go all the way at the top and I'm going to do import react player from react player like this cool and right underneath here we're going to say const video link and then we're going to say set video link like this equal use State and leave that blank okay cool now inside of our handle change actually are we going to work on inside of our handle change let me see okay so right here where I'm doing this share image thing right above upload image um where should we add this actually let me think so let's keep this inside of our upload image but right underneath where we're doing the share image line okay so right here or we're gonna do a couple of things I'm going to add a empty react jss jsx fragment okay and inside of this let's add an input uh we're gonna keep it text and placeholder will be please input a video link like that and then the value will be whatever is the video link that we give it and of course on change we're gonna say take the event and set the video URL set the video link based on whatever the user gives you okay the value of the event great so input ends here and right underneath input what we're going to do is open close squiggly and I'm going to say if video link exists then what I want you to do okay and let's close this bracket and go react player all right and I just imported it so I imported import react player from react dash player so make sure you go ahead and do that let's say react player with is equal to 10 uh let's go 100 percent okay and then we're gonna go URL and is whichever video link that's actually set in our state at the moment okay save beautiful so that should be pretty good all right now we're gonna test it out and see if it if it does anything whoops let's do yarn start again so it starts up our app okay wake up app cool all right so we got please input a video link let's see if I have a YouTube video link boom right when I embed it it's right there that is awesome and this also happens to be my video if you want to go check out my chess Channel welcome that's awesome yeah beautiful let's go 20 on the width so that made it really really tiny just like this so make sure choose 100 on your react player width so react player plays really nicely with videos okay so we're good now we're gonna make it so you can switch between share image or share video all right here we go welcome back to the same thing that you were on so let's just continue going all right I just want to take a little break but it's all good we're back now and we're ready to go okay can I hear myself beautiful awesome so let's just go ahead and get started with this right so so far we're doing a great job we got the video players showing we got me looking beautiful here right there okay maybe for you it's your video that you're putting okay you can use your own YouTube video link and then it'll be you with that said let's go ahead and make it so we can switch between whichever one we want right because right now we're seeing both image and the YouTube url I don't want to see both of them I just want to see one of them okay cool so let's go ahead and add that functionality okay now the functionality is going to take a little bit so first things first we're going to start off by going inside of our post model so make sure you're there and right here we're going to add that component okay so not component we're going to add a state variable here okay because this is going to change at some point so asset area and then of course the um the way that we are using it is going to be set asset area cool just like this is a convention we use and default is going to be empty cool now let's go under where we have set chair image okay underneath that we're going to make a new function here that we're going to use switch asset area cool it'll take in the area as an argument and then it's going to do a couple of things so it's going to make the image just empty we'll also do set video link and we'll make that empty cool and then we're going to do set asset area to the area that we received okay and uh that's all good okay awesome now let's go to our reset in in our reset we're just going to add a few more things okay but we're gonna add that above our handle Click Change okay so I'm gonna do set share image let's go blank here set video link will go blank because again this is reset so this should reset essentially all of those States so that's what all we're doing there now let's go down under where we have the area focus in our text area Okay so right below this I'm gonna do a couple of things okay what I'm going to do is let's open up our squiggly bracket here okay and um let's go ahead let's go ahead and what I'm going to do is I'm going to close the squiggly bracket kind of in this weird area right underneath this jsx the jsx fragment that's ending right underneath this uh player that's where I'm going to add the ending of that okay and essentially we're going to have a ternary operator in between there so let's do this okay so if asset area is equal to image then I want the following to happen all right whoops image then I want this all of this to happen okay the upload image thing to show up okay um all right guys so I'm gonna take this where this upload image is ending I'm gonna take it okay I'm gonna take this thing here and let's move it up okay so boom boom boom let's go up top and uh let's end this component right here okay the upload image component and here's where I'm going to add my ternary so I'm going to do colon here this is a little hard to read and um and I apologize about that but bear with me here and then I'm gonna say if the asset area is Media then I want you to do the following okay in that case do all of this so again a little hard to read but I'm basically saying if it's image then do all of this okay the upload image component okay if the asset area is Media then do all of this okay great and then let's go ahead and just switch a couple of things so I'm going to find my asset button and all I'm gonna do for my asset button is very simple I will simply add an on click on this thing like this let's open this up go like that beautiful and I'm going to do switch asset area like so and uh pass in image okay give it pass in the image for that and then where's my other asset button right here this is the one for the video and I'm just gonna say on click and we're going to do switch asset area and I'm just going to say media like so okay and then that should be pretty freaking good great pretty freaking cool wow look at that it's working and it looks nice right when I click the image I see this when I click this one I see this video right there okay and how is that working well uh this is this is uh one asset button which is right here and this asset button number two this video one okay so we got one and two I'll write one and two just like so okay this image one is this one the one and this media one is this video one now what happens when I click this video one or sorry this picture one is this on click thing runs and it changes my estate variable this asset area one and it changes it to image okay so well let's go into that function and see what that's doing okay it changes it to an image okay so I go switch asset area and I pass it the image and then it just changes it to an image all right and that makes the code appear and work and do do essentially what I wanted to do okay if I go and do switch asset area to Media it goes ahead and changes it to a media okay and then boom you get your switching statements here boom and here I can put my video link to a YouTube video like so and it will actually even put the video here okay and let's test putting an image and let's see if our image works beautiful our image is working and that's exactly what we want so we're done with that functionality now we're going to connect with our store and uh get user info okay so let's go down first of all let's actually just import so I'm going to do import connect because we're going to need to connect to our Redux store in a second so let's do this okay all right so now we're going to map states to props the boring usual Redux stuff which you know the Redux toolkit you don't need to know how to do and do map state to props state and um actually this is going to be an expression like that okay let's leave it empty for now and I'm just going to do export default connect map state to props we'll do map dispatch uh dispatch to props okay and then we'll do Post modal like that actually my bad okay uh this is this one is going to be map dispatch map dispatch to props okay and uh that's going to be good for the dispatch to prompts and above this I'm going to add map state to props okay and we'll make this state now this one is going to be dispatch okay so this one that says state cool let's go like this all right I like putting parentheses here hopefully prettier likes it too great and what I'm going to do is say return user State user state DOT State like that okay so now that should be good to go that's that all right now we're going to display the user info so let's go to user info component which is up here and we're going to add our little ternary action and let's go ahead and do that now okay so I'm going to say props.user.photo URL so hey if the photo URL is there then I want you to do the following then I want you to show the image and the source for this is going to be the actual URL for the photo props.user.photo URL like so all right and I don't need to do anything else I think that should be good cool let's end this photo one okay and then we need an or statement so an or statement I'm going to basically give it this as my or statement and then we need to end this squiggly okay so what is my error here let's see I think I'm ending it too early so let's remove that there so basically I'm saying hey does the photo exist if it exists if the user then showed the photo of the actual user that we pulled from Firebase otherwise showed us Anonymous user photo so let's click the post modal okay now it's having an error cannot read property photo URL of undefined okay no problem um so what basically needs to happen is I need to right now actually I'm logged in logged in okay weird error we'll figure it out together not to worry okay let's hit save on this thing and then let's go ahead underneath here we got our span tag in our span what I'm going to say is props.user that display name okay just like that great and of course we gotta close our squiggly otherwise we're going to be in some troubles cool so let's try signing out let's try signing in with Google okay cannot read property photo URL of undefined interesting because pretty sure we're freaking logged in oh duh this is why I don't have access to the user I gotta access the freaking user okay that's what user is okay State at usersate.user okay so now up here where I'm asking for the user command F user okay where I want to get the user's photo now I have access to the user's photo so let's hit save let's hit refresh and now I'm going to have access to the user's photo okay so for example let's Click Boom there we go okay so now let's go full screen here Okay click Start a post and if you're logged in we'll have a photo here if you're not logged in you shouldn't even be able to get to this page but if you did get to this page you'll have this Anonymous photo as a fallback okay so great now we got that photo now let's add functionality with the image okay we want to be able to actually upload the image to Firebase storage so let's go ahead and do that now so first things first well what are the first things first so let's go to actions because we're going to add an action and we're going to add a new action again it's going to be called Post article API and it will take in a payload okay and I'm just going to return a dispatch event that's going to look like the following okay if what I want to do is payload is payload dot image is not blank so we have an image then I'm going to set my upload to be storage dot ref whoops storage dot ref okay Images slash payloadimage.name okay and then let's get out of here and we're going to use the dot put method and we'll do payload dot image cool so this is going to help us upload our image all right and uh let's go ahead and make sure that we do that all right now let's do upload okay and I'll do upload dot on cool on state changed okay then we're going to do snapshot all right let's go and not that one let's go like that snapshot I'm going to say const progress is the following I'm gonna have snapshot bytes transferred boom and we'll do snapshot dot total bytes bytes just like that all right and let's multiply that by a hundred and close it off cool all right now this is going to be helpful for making that loading bar soon and you guys will see how this is actually going to help you okay so now boom we have this one right here let's just wrap this thing inside of parens right here um it doesn't need it okay it's redundant cool let's get out of here and now let's basically go console log uh progress okay and I'll do this progress okay and we'll put a percent sign so they'll show us how's our progress doing so far I don't want my function to be ending here so this upload on needed to be ending a little bit later all right so we're gonna need quite a lot of little weird changes here so just follow along um gets messy Okay so open the parenthesis here and we're going to close this okay because this whole thing is an expression then I'm going to console log the progress and then what I want to do is I want to essentially close out everything right so for example this squiggly here let's close that out that parentheses right there I'm going to close that out I also want to close this squiggly right there okay and then I also want to close that quickly out right there and I also want to close that squiggly out right there and that should effectively take care of everything and once I hit save it should kind of format it like this okay but there's a couple of things that we got to do here all right now underneath this what I want to basically say is if the snapshot state is running on the other hand okay then what I want to do is I want to console log the progress okay progress like this and boom cool so in both cases kind of show me show me what's going on okay and then let's go underneath here okay right there and what I will say is if there's an error then console.log error code okay so again I know there's a lot going on in this upload so there there's a lot right so for example this upload function it took in the state change then it took in this function right here on the Fly and then it's also taking in uh what needs to happen when there's an error okay cool and then let's also do async okay we're gonna have download URL and what that's going to do is we're going to wait upload cool and we're going to do get download URL like so okay all right so storage is not defined we will Define storage by importing it okay so let's go ahead up at the top and in here right after provider I'm going to upload storage from Firebase that'll take care of that we also want to add our database let's do import DB from Firebase we're going to need that later okay cool let's come on down now and we got our download URL so that's good now we need to do a couple of things so right underneath this download URL we're gonna do our DB collection okay so DB collection articles to the Articles collection we're going to add the following the actor it's going to have the following things in here description will be payload of the user email title will beep display name like so date will be whatever is the time stamp of the payload and then image will be the photo URL of course okay great and then underneath Here video will be payload video shared image will be the download URL that we made comments will be zeroable kind of just hard code that for now and description will be the payload description okay so that should be good I know that that was like a pretty hefty piece of code but let's go to our post model and now actually add that functionality and we're pretty close so hang in there with me guys let's import Firebase from Firebase okay and then we're going to import our Post article API like so and let's do from dot dot actions okay so that gets us that now let's go where our switch asset area shows up cool and let's add in our new method okay our function here pulse article okay it's going to take an event and again I want to kind of prevent um any of the weird stuff happening in react where things need to refresh and so on so let's take care of that and I'm basically going to say if the target does not equal to the current Target then just return cool and then I'm gonna Define our payload and image will be the share image video will be the video link our user will be our actual user description description will be whatever the text is that the user adds and of course timestamp will be Firebase timestamp okay so that's why we imported Firebase and then here we're going to have props Dot Post article that's going to take the payload okay and then simply let's go ahead and reset e and then we'll call this function and we'll reset everything okay once it's added and now let's basically go ahead and add these buttons so I'm gonna go down to my post button and inside of my post button when I click that button I want a couple of things to happen okay so let's go here and we'll Define an on click just leave it blank for a second and in our on click what I want to happen is I'm going to give it an event and then I want the following things to occur run our Post article function and give it the event details okay that means the description the text any information that we have already about the user and now just let's go to our dispatch and add all of that in cool so let's go here and let's add in that so Post article and we will do it'll take in a payload okay and then we'll dispatch Post article API payload like that okay beautiful now let's see if it actually does anything for now so I will take in an image select an image click an image do that test let's hit post post so maybe it's doing something maybe it isn't but the only way to go and check is to go inside of our firestore database and let's see if anything is actually happening okay so let's go ahead and create a database I'll put it in test mode let's hit next and enable all right that's going to be important because that allows our database to actually be created in the first place otherwise we will not have a database and firestore is actually very very powerful so I like using this as our database okay all right now we don't have any collections or anything like that so let's try hitting post again does that do anything nope not doing anything right now which is totally fine and by the way firestore also has storage okay so I'm going to click on that I'm gonna go in there so on the left hand side I have storage and I can even upload a file right so let's just click here upload a file see what happens I'm just kind of like hard coding and uploading it there okay so boom it uploaded it and now we'll be able to retrieve file from here okay so that's the file data it's kind of nice GUI that they have actually for uploading uh things so pretty uh simple but that's just kind of like on me hard coding it okay but that's not the way we're going to do what we're going to do in our app oh and going back to index file by the way and our actions index.js um this is squiggly okay not parentheses that's why it's not changing uh that's why it's actually not using that variable okay this is like template literals so that's how they work but almost refresh cool okay let's try uploading the image now hopefully that works Let's test test test test test okay if it works it'll probably upload it to our storage folder inside of our Firebase okay so let's keep on trying this thing all right so let's actually debug this real quick together because I think that's going to be helpful so let's go inside of Post article and I'm going to type in console log uh post Malone all right let's uh add a rocket here okay it's not gonna add a rocket so let's just add a person here that's fine all right so I have my image I'm going to hit post and it says post Malone so I want to see where it's getting to so it's getting to this line let's now add a console log here and I'm just going to say and can I add add a cake here let's add that cake I don't know why it's uh being funny but I'm just gonna say hello here okay and let's see if it gets in here oh ah okay so it seems like it's getting to this if statement and then it's just returning so it's actually not doing any of this and it's not running this Post article payload function because that Post article payload actually does everything that we need to do it actually does this Post article right we give it the payload it dispatches it and then it gives it to this function this function knows how to upload so it's never even getting to that it's just dying right here and that's because e.target is not equal correct Target this should be car rent Target okay so delete here um and now it should not be getting to that hello so let's try again and look progress zero progress 28 progress 85 progress 100 wow so that actually looks good looks like something happened so I'm gonna go to my Firebase refresh is it in my storage or is it in my database oh it's in my storage I oh that's cool I have an images folder and here's my image Gatsby versus next.js okay beautiful it is all is it also in my database yes it is I haven't collections here so I'm going to delete this other uh record I had um actually let me just leave that I just had like some dummy freaking record okay so delete um I don't know if it deletes the whole thing or not it's not deleting it that's fine so just forget about that one but it just added this new record here in my collection articles okay how do I know that well if I go to my code inside of my index.js I have this line here that says hey um DB collection articles inside of Firebase add and then add this whole thing okay so we got actor an actor has all these things inside of it right and then I also got just video shared image and comments so video shared image description of comments cool which is corresponds to these four things and then actor and all of that corresponds to all of this okay so that looks good to me so far now finally it's working and this progress bar is working so that's really good progress on our end now let's add the same post functionality but with video as well okay and how we're gonna do that is it's going to be very simple so remember how we have this if statement right here that says payload image well what we're going to do is say let's find where that ends right there okay and I'm just going to do else if be careful with the indentation otherwise you're going to get caught okay and I'm going to say if payload is video then I'm going to do DB collection and essentially I'm going to do the same thing which is going to be articles dot add okay and we're going to do actor description payload.user.email title I'm just going to copy some of these okay title is going to be that uh date is going to be whoops didn't mean to delete it okay so paste and then I'm going to copy copy image and also paste it right here okay so those are going to be the same and also this whole thing pretty much is also going to be the same video payload video shared image so the there's going to be only one difference though okay so I'll show you that in just a second let's hit save now instead of shared image being the download URL it's just going to be empty because it's not an image cool capiche makes sense okay great so that's it that's all that happens if we choose to add a video instead of an image okay so let's try adding let's go here and refresh and let's go here try adding a video we'll add a YouTube video test hit post and uh hopefully something happens let's go to our app did it add a video yes it added a video right there okay it's inside of our database we'll be able to get access to it whenever we want so on and so forth okay cool now we're going to add in an article reducer and this is going to be helpful for when we actually want to start pulling the Articles and actually showing the Articles okay so let's go ahead and start working on that so I'm going to go inside of my reducer so source reducers going to my reducers folder and we're going to create a new file and it's going to be called article reducer.js AKA article updater okay much better name for a reducer and I'm just going to say export const in net State like this loading is false okay so the initial state is going to be loading is false so we won't we shouldn't see that loading Circle in the start okay my article reducer what that's going to be is hey my initial state let's make it the net state and then it's going to take in an action whoops my bad there we go and then we're going to take a switch based on the action type that's just how Redux works okay and again default is going to be just returning the existing state and I'm going to export default article reducer like so now let's go inside of our index.js which is inside of reducer so the re index.js inside a reducer so go to that and uh right underneath this user reducer I'm going to add in an article reducer like that and underneath my root reducer I'm going to add so user state is good I'm just going to add article state and we will do article reducer like so all right so that's good now we're going to start working on the loading bar okay so we can see the loading bar uh showing up as we um you know upload a video or an image we want to see like a little spinning circular loading bar so let's start with going into our action type.js inside of action so action type.js so this is going to be export con set loading underscore status equals set loading status like that okay beautiful and let's go inside of our article reducer okay and I'm gonna do one thing inside of my article reducers which is I'm going to add an import statement at the top and I'm going to say import set set loading status from actions action type okay so let's import that one and then we're going to do underneath our action type let's go ahead and do that so I'm going to say case set loading status okay and I'm going to say a return whatever the state previously was and then add this new loading State on top of that okay keep in mind because this is Redux nothing is being mutated now let's go to our index not that index let's go to our actions index.js there's just so many indexes okay so this import right here we're going to do set user and also set loading status and let's go underneath our um I mean we can kind of add this wherever we want but I'll just add it here okay let's let's just add it right there okay and I'm gonna just do export constant set loading is equal to it'll take in status as an input and we'll do type set loadings oops set loading status is going to be whatever the status we pass it okay and now let's go inside of our function Post article API and right underneath this return dispatch I'm gonna say dispatch set loading to be true great let's give a little Gap here just so it looks cleaner great now let's go to our image and our image if statement right go all the way down to where we have the payload.description okay and right underneath that I'm going to say dispatch set loading false okay so once all of that happens we're gonna say finish the loading meaning we'll keep spinning keep spinning keep spinning until the whole thing is uploaded and added to our articles as soon as it's added to our articles in our Firebase database then stop the spinning okay dispatch an action to our Redux store change the state of the set loading got it and then we're going to do the same thing for the when the video uh is done being uploaded so these are the two parts where we're going to switch the loading to essentially false and for it to stop spinning okay beautiful now next up we're going to like add our spinning logos and things like that okay so here's the spending logo it's going to be called spin loader this is what it is okay spinloader.svg the it already comes in with the graphic of the spinning so we won't need to do any like fancy CSS so that's a good thing all right take it and add it to your images and then we're going to x out of it okay and now we're gonna go to main.js so we can add that there okay so let's go to where our share box is because it's going to be inside of sharebox so inside of sharebox we have we don't need this text here by the way any more share let's hit refresh cool so that share word is gone great okay now I'm gonna add in a squiggly here okay and I'm gonna close this squiggly uh where should I close this squiggly I'll close it let me think about where to close it actually so let's just close this squiggly right underneath here okay and what I'm basically gonna say is hey if the user exists then show the user photo like that okay and then here's what I want you to do if the user photo URL exists then again this is a ternary operator we're going to do this show me the actual users photo end okay otherwise show me just an anonymous photo okay beautiful I'm gonna take that div and uh let's put it right underneath the share box okay just like that so now what it should look like is we have one div inside of here what happens is we either see the user's image or we see the anonymous image and then we have it button okay so if I hit start a post I see this cool start a post okay and then it uh when I click that startup post button this thing is treated like a button and when I click it the handle click uh function runs okay so that little thing we added there is helpful and awesome and now on this button what we're going to do is we're just going to add in what happens when it is uh disabled okay so we're going to do props out loading okay and if so loading is either true otherwise it's false okay so if it's loading set the disable to True otherwise set it to false so like we shouldn't be able to click that thing or do anything to it if it's a loading cool let's go to where our content component is so let's find content um actually we don't have content component yet so let's go ahead and add it and where I want to add it is let's go to our share box right there okay and right underneath my share box I'm going to add this cool so let's do this and I'm going to do props.loading so if my loading is going on then show my loading spinner Images slash spin loader.svg okay and I think we should be good even with that and let's end that image that should be good okay so our content um our content component is actually going to be just a tad bit longer so let's go ahead and remove this div that we're wrapping article in and instead we're going to wrap article inside of content okay so I'm going to remove the um let's go ahead and remove that div and let's grab the ending of that content and let's go all the way down to where article ends and let's remove this div as well and paste content okay so instead of rap ing our article in a div we're going to wrap article in our content component now again it's going to complain it's gonna be like hey you haven't defined content okay no problem we're Pros now so we're gonna go ahead and Define content I'm gonna do style div okay let's go up boom in there and I'm gonna do text align Center just like this okay and um let me go ahead cool okay let's do again this is for the loading part okay I'm gonna do image with 30 pixels all right and then let's go to the end here all right and um we're now gonna Define what happens to our map State props so map state to props and we'll do a returned loading state articlestate.loading and we'll also do what's going on with the user so we'll get access to the user state and then let's do map dispatch to props okay and we'll just leave that blank for now like this leave it blank cool and let's do export default and we'll do connect map dispatch to props as well and of course Main that's this file that we're in now it's like hey I don't know what connect is okay don't worry it's not Connect Four but it's importing connect from react Redux like so and that should know what we're trying to do so let's try to add an image and see what happens now we did not get a spinner okay that was not fun we definitely expected a spinner and then we got like Rick Rolled oh actually first of all let's go to this part here we I don't need these uh squigglies here first of all for the loading so let's remove that and uh let's try refreshing now and giving it a good old College try seeing if the spinner shows up nope okay and let's actually try putting a period here real quick and do period slash Images slash spinloader.svg let's see if that helps us out here nope okay I'm officially an idiot so I was like wait what the frick is going on the loading bar so loading bar is completely working I just forgot that it Works um not to show the image because the image pretty much just loads instantaneously but this bar is actually useful for when I hit post now the loading bar shows so perfect okay everything is working as expected and we're making great progress this was really awesome and fun so far so it wasn't because I put a little period in front of my um uh whatever that thing was uh the spinner the spinner logo okay so anyways good progress let's keep going now what we're going to do is when the page is loading we're gonna call the API using a use effect and we're going to use that to get actually the Articles from Firebase okay so we're going to use react hooks to get articles from Firebase so let's go ahead and do that so I'm gonna go into my index which is index.js inside of my actions okay and uh let's go ahead and add a completely new function in here so I'm going to do export function and do get articles article pulse API okay and then we're going to say return dispatch like so and we're going to say let payload Okay so let's just leave payload as is and I'm going to say DB dot collection I'll do articles and now we're going to get data from the Articles okay so we're gonna do order by we're gonna do actor dot date cool and we're going to do descending like so and uh then I'm gonna do on Snapshot okay this allows me to read data from my Firebase I'm going to say payload is equal to snapshot Dot docs.map and all the documents that I pretty much get back I'm essentially going to just kind of put them in an array okay map them that's what map will output that's what payload will become and I'll console the log payload as well so you can kind of see it okay cool now I have to refer to this and use this inside of my main JS okay so let's go to main let's go import I'm gonna import use effect so I can use it and I'm going to bring use State because I will also need State need to also manage State cool let's do import the get articles function as well that we made inside of our actions okay we're going to do actions dot dot slash actions just like that great and uh let's go ahead and just add that uh right here let's say use effect cool and props.get articles okay so this will just pretty much run it once articles like this so essentially when I go to main page uh we're gonna try to run this once let's go down all the way and now we're gonna do our Redux stuff so let's go to dispatch data props I'm gonna go inside of here let's do get articles and um essentially going to say dispatch get articles API like so and run it run it run it run it okay okay let's see do I have an error here use effect and use State what is it complaining about um oh I have uh I have it twice so that can just be on one line that's fine refresh cannot read property collection of undefined okay great so let's hit inspect and see if we're console logging anything we got an array of four and uh this is perfect because as you can see this array of four is telling me what do I have okay so I have four items okay one is um this image right here the user image one is this image right here okay let me copy that string and paste it that image right there cool here's another one it has a link to that video and then here's another one okay so shared image let's see where that takes me oh permission denied okay all good but it's looking like I have access to all of this and I can actually read it okay now what we're going to do is we're going to dispatch an action to the store um and uh for for setting articles okay this will allow us to set articles and then later we'll be able to do a lot more things with them all right cool so let's go ahead and do that so I'm gonna go inside of my action type and let's have another action type export const get articles and uh surprise surprise is going to be called get articles cool now let's go inside of my main and inside of my main where I'm defining my mapping state to props let's add articles in here as well and I'm going to say state.article state dot articles like this cool and uh let's go inside of my article reducer okay if we don't have one do we need to create one no we have article reducer great okay let's go to our initial State and we're going to do a few things actually although at the top so we're going to import set loading status we're also going to import get articles okay underneath here I'm going to say articles and uh whoops like this let's make articles uh an empty array in the start all right initial and now in our switch cases we're going to say hey if there's a case of get articles then what we need to do is return the existing state along with whatever the Articles payload is just like so cool and now let's go to index inside of our actions all right and in our index we are going to import we have set user we have set loading status now let's go ahead and add get articles and import this and let's go here and I'm going to do export const get articles payload type get articles like that payload will be payload okay and let's go all the way down where I'm like sorting it by actor date and descending order all I'm going to do instead of this console log we're going to dispatch this I'm going to say get articles payload okay and I don't need this line anymore so let's hit save on this thing so we're done okay this is allowing us to set the articles okay cool test Mana just add a dummy image not too much be happening right now cool okay so everything is working now what I want to do is I want to hide the main content until there are articles so we don't want to show any of the content unless we have like articles in there okay so like for example if I don't have any articles then like kind of don't show any of this the content cool so let's we're inside of our main.js let's go all the way up let's go up right above the container okay and right above the container I'm going to open up a jsx fragment and uh right underneath where does the container end so let's see where our container ends under what where our container ends I'm going to close off my jsx fragment okay and here's another thing I'm going to do I'm going to open up a squiggly all the way at the top right here okay and uh we're gonna close it all the way at the bottom right before the jsx fragment ending and hit save okay now while we're doing this is so we can add our ternary operator so I'm going to say if articles length is zero meaning there's no articles then what I want you to do is basically say they're what the hell just happened and there we go there are no articles like that okay that's all I want you to say or give me all of the things okay give me the share box Give Me Everything cool so this is a pretty simple ternary operator but it's also pretty badass because it's like wait where did my ending squiggly go it's also pretty badass it basically says if there's zero then just show this there are no articles and if there are articles then do all of this okay kind of crazy cool okay beautiful now we're gonna add the loader uh component all right so a few things need to happen so let's go and make the loader component all right actually you know what let's actually skip the loader component because I think it's going to add a ton of additional code and not that much functionality so let's pass on that honestly and instead what I want to do is uh let's display the articles that we actually get back from Firebase okay I think that's going to be a lot more uh interesting to add cool so to get started on this we're just going to do a few things inside of our main JS let's go main.js cool I'm there um let's go down to where I'm loading my spinner down down down okay so here's where my spinner is happening okay now right underneath this I'm going to do a couple of things here okay so buckle up because a lot is going to be happening here so hang in there with me let's go props dot articles dot length all right if it's greater than zero then I want the following to happen I want to map those articles okay and I'm going to need the key for performance sake so I'm going to say hey article key is equal to key like so okay and there's a lot of stuff that we're going to be deleting soon as well and it's going to make a ton of sense shortly okay so let's go articles.map key okay let's put a bracket there okay and we're gonna need to end that article at some point but not to worry let's actually do this okay so I'm gonna remove all of this here so we're just opening this okay and I'm just going to use this article right here and let's give it a key cool because like initially I was just like showing one post but we're gonna need to show multiple posts okay so this whole thing is gonna end up getting wrapped up okay so we're gonna have to go all the way down and wrap up this whole thing so let's go all the way outside of article let's go ahead and close it okay so hopefully the error should stop just for a little bit okay now we're going to make our changes that we wanted to make okay so inside of our a um we're not just going to have this hardcoded image of the user we're going to have the image of the actual uh user okay so let's do article dot actor dot image okay so see now it's cool because it has my image right there that's what we wanted it's pulling that straight from Firebase that's a really really good sign so that's done the next thing is where it says title we're going to dynamically get this as well so I'm going to say article dot actor dot title like so okay so now notice that my name is coming through that's also really good let's do the same thing here article dot actor dot description okay and now my email is showing up and then I'm going to do article dot actor dot date and we're going to make it if I leave it here let's see what it does very interesting let's see if it bugs out it freaks out okay and that's because we're getting a weird date from Firebase so we're gonna do that to date like that and let's see if that fixes it refresh okay and if that doesn't fix it then we're gonna do that to locale date string okay hopefully that should fix it and it does okay all we had to do was change it and indeed it is April 24th here Saturday 1 17 a.m so I'm grinding out here 1 17 am for your beautiful face so if you're happy about that and you want to show your appreciation smash that like button subscribe to the channel all right that's what I got for you so that to me looks good outside of this let's see what do we need to change where it says description let's change you know the description is hard coded so let's change that with article dot description like so okay so test that's actually what I wrote test test test test test okay let's see what happens if I write hello and hit post okay so right now those things are not actually being added uh to the databases and coming back we're not able to read back from it so no worries okay because it's still also sometimes waiting for an image so a couple of things are happening and while it's loading did you notice I couldn't make a new post so that was cool because it disables uh the start a post button so that's really cool functionality underneath shared image we're gonna do we're gonna do a couple of things okay side of shared image should we leave this hardcoded image probably not probably not so we're going to get rid of it okay why well because it's hard coded we don't want it to be hardcoded we want to work on it and change things dynamically okay so here we go so I'm going to say if article shared image is not there and article dot video is there then what I want you to do is use the react player all right so we're going to do react player and I'm going to give it a width of 100 percent like that okay and URL is going to be article dot video like this and let's close it cool all right so let's also import the react player okay so let's go all the way to the top I'm going to do import react player from react player okay dope cool and uh now we'll add our or statement and we're going to say or do the following okay article dot shared image if that's there then do this image article dot shared image and then just close it off okay so open close um what's the problem here did I add a question mark question mark oh my bad this should not be here yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because that's gonna end that whole thing okay wow that looks great look at that yeah buddy okay so I like it I like it a lot okay hover over this beautiful that's absolutely absolutely great all right now let's do articles comments okay so let's go down town right underneath so let's find our social so we have our social accounts ending uh here and let's go a little bit above that I have comments and my comments are hardcoded in here I don't want it to be hardcoded so we're going to make them Dynamic and I'm going to do article dot comments all right zero almost kind of like hardcoded but you know not really so that's good okay great so this is looking good now this is a lot of code a lot a lot just this line is almost 400 lines of code I'll just file I mean so great we have all of this showing up exactly like how we want it that makes me really happy and then of course let's do should we add more text now I don't think I'm going to add this more text functionality okay uh let's try now adding another post and let's see if it actually reads hey there uh we just got done building LinkedIn clone with fire I would react.js Firebase and Redux for image I don't know let me go and pick a cool image so I'm gonna go inside of thumbnails and uh sure let's just pick uh let's pick one of these let's just pick this why not why not let's hit post look at that we just got done building our LinkedIn clone with react.js Firebase and Redux so now our post functionality is completely working exactly the way we want it to that is absolutely gorgeous all right and before we deploy this thing because we're so freaking close and I'm so proud of you that you've done such a good job we just need to fix one thing this over here looks funny and these like buttons and these things look funny so this is going to be uh pretty simple so let's go inside of our main.js and first let's fix social accounts so social count component is that one right there this one right here okay so inside of our button let's try going border none so let's take away the border and uh let's also do background color white okay so just just matches the the rest of the background okay great so that looks good to me let's also go inside of social actions and we're going to do something similar inside of our button let's go um let's go border none okay great and let's go background color White okay beautiful so now there you go that is our LinkedIn clone it is looking absolutely gorgeous you can log in you can log out I mean every single functionality is there we're using Redux we have our drop down menus working I mean this is beautiful like think about it right like if I go mobile mode right look at how good the mobile version looks just absolutely freaking beautiful okay so this is an amazing clone you've done a great job so far and now for the last piece of the puzzle all we're gonna do is we're gonna deploy it together okay so sometimes um I forget my deploying commands but let's just go ahead and figure it out um you know in this video so first things first but one thing I know that I need to do is I'm gonna need to run npm run build and I'm also going to need to set up Firebase hosting okay so we're gonna go ahead through that process now um let's try let's try um npm run build okay and let's see it go through the build okay and then we're going to do Firebase deploy and let's see what happens and then we run into errors we'll try to solve them together okay not to worry just make sure you're inside of um the main folder like LinkedIn clone okay main directory now we should have a build folder and this is going to be all our optimized images and files that are going to be ready are are going to be essentially production ready okay so there we go that's good our build is good to go and now I'm gonna try doing Firebase deploy so I'm imagining I'm gonna get some kind of error or some kind of process okay cool no worries let's see do I have any Firebase commands that I've written uhhuh so I remember the command is actually Firebase and net that's what I was looking for okay so we're just going to initialize it let's go here and select hosting because we're going to need to host it um so that's good let's go use an existing project and let's go to where's LinkedIn clone is it actually logged into the right one because I'm not seeing my project okay I'm gonna end out of it let's do Firebase init one more time and let's go hosting okay and uh let's create a new project because that that project just might not have been there okay let's call it LinkedIn clone or would you like to call your project LinkedIn clone I did not mean to specify an ID there's already a project with LinkedIn clone okay all good so let's actually go to Firebase from here okay let's go to project overview project settings okay link to a Firebase hosting site let's see if we can do that boom okay and let's go through the init project uh init process one more time let's do hosting hit enter um I don't think it's gonna let me select an existing project why is it not seeing any of the linkedins though that's what I'm curious about because this sees all this other stuff but it not does not see any of the linkedins which is very interesting to me so one thing you can do is make sure so it's because I'm logged into the wrong Firebase I'm going to see if I can log out and I'm going to log into the right Firebase okay that's really where my problems were coming from cool so you can do this too if you're not logged into Firebase make sure you log into Firebase if you haven't installed Firebase make sure you install Firebase now would be a good time now I'm logged in to Firebase okay so good now let's do Firebase and net now I should see my dummy LinkedIn clone use an existing project the dummy LinkedIn clone that we worked on our directory is going to be build I'm going to hit enter configure as a single page app I'm going to say yes set up automatic bills file Bill already exists you want to overwrite just hit enter okay so now we've gone through the initialization process I've also done npm run build so I have my build folder let's try Firebase build is it gonna work is it gonna work yo let's go guys amazing congratulations the LinkedIn clone that you worked and we worked so hard for is deployed so now let's go ahead and check it out hopefully it actually works and it doesn't embarrass us Let's Go full screen this is the deployed version you should be able to go and play around with this let's hit sign in with Google and let's see if it allows us to log in log in boom I'm inside and look at that it has access to my entire database it's fully up and running okay it has a bunch of my files everything I need okay and maybe by the time you're watching this I'm probably gonna have disabled for you to write to the database because people add all kinds of funny stuff when they're allowed to let's try um taking an
