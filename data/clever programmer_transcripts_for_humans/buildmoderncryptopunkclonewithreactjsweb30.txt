02:50 - dive in just want to thank our sponsor
02:52 - for making this possible third web we're
02:55 - going to be using the technology to

02:59 - this event to happen so i just want to
03:01 - take a second to thank them because
03:02 - that's you know they are what makes this
03:04 - type of event possible
03:07 - and again we're going to be using some
03:08 - of their technology
03:11 - uh to build out this event right that's
03:12 - we're going to be building our own nft
03:15 - yep
03:16 - okay um i know a lot of you guys said
03:19 - you completed the homework it's all good
03:21 - so you can drop it in the chat if you

03:24 - that's totally fine and here's the
03:26 - agenda for today this is day two and
03:28 - we're gonna building an amazing project
03:31 - all right that's what's gonna happen and
03:32 - day three tomorrow we're gonna go over
03:35 - how to land the front end developer job
03:37 - in 90 days okay this is the project that
03:40 - we're going to be building we just kind
03:42 - of went over this and remember to show
03:44 - up for the last day guys because that's
03:46 - going to be one of the most special days

03:57 - with today's training
03:59 - so a couple of things that i want to say
04:02 - to preface this okay and
04:05 - i think this is going to be really
04:06 - important
04:08 - we're going to be building a pretty
04:10 - awesome project it's going to be you
04:12 - know mind-blowing it's gonna be exciting
04:14 - but here's what's gonna happen a lot of
04:16 - you are beginners
04:18 - maybe and even some of you who are like
04:20 - intermediate you're still maybe not
04:21 - advanced
04:22 - because we're gonna build this entire
04:24 - project in one day
04:26 - i'm gonna have to be going really fast
04:29 - okay and i'm gonna be going a pretty
04:30 - fast speed which means a lot of you are
04:34 - gonna start freaking out a lot of you
04:36 - are gonna be like i can't keep up
04:39 - or i'm not able to make this progress
04:41 - and then what happens is this you guys
04:44 - see right now look around you in the
04:45 - zoom and you see all these other faces
04:47 - around you right you guys see how many
04:49 - people does it say we have right now on
04:51 - zoom how many people does it say right
04:53 - now we have live on zoom or youtube how
04:55 - many people
05:03 - it says we got 600 live total but we
05:06 - have 162 live on zoom right we got 162.
05:10 - watch what happens to that number i
05:12 - promise you this is the day when that
05:14 - number drops the most can you can you
05:16 - guys guess why that number drops the
05:18 - most on this day
05:22 - why does it happen frustration people
05:24 - can't keep up people get scared
05:27 - yes give up saturday discourage it's not
05:30 - easy
05:32 - yes so today is the day where stuff gets
05:35 - hard today is the day where it actually
05:37 - gets challenging because you're actually
05:39 - coding
05:40 - okay so that number keep an eye on it i
05:43 - promise you it's gonna have the steepest
05:45 - drop of all the other days because it's
05:47 - coding related okay
05:49 - so for those of you that stay
05:51 - which of you guys are planning to stay
05:53 - and stick through it and don't lie to me
05:55 - it's fine you can tell me the truth
05:57 - which ones of you are gonna commit to
05:59 - actually staying and seeing it through
06:01 - today you're like i'm not gonna leave
06:02 - until this project is freaking done how
06:06 - many of you are doing that
06:09 - every single one of you that is saying
06:10 - yes me i will
06:13 - i'm gonna hold you accountable to that
06:15 - okay we can download this chat and see
06:17 - exactly which one of you guys are saying
06:19 - so i want to hold you accountable to
06:20 - that
06:22 - um i want to mentally prepare you before
06:24 - we get into it
06:26 - because i want to make sure that you you
06:28 - get through it okay and
06:30 - last thing i want to say
06:33 - right before we get in this is the last
06:34 - thing i promised and then we're going to
06:35 - jump in last thing i want to say
06:37 - is this
06:40 - if it gets challenging which it will
06:42 - just watch it just relax and just watch
06:44 - it you don't need to keep up with me you
06:45 - don't need to code it right alongside me
06:48 - you're probably not going to be able to
06:49 - because i'm going to be going really
06:50 - fast
06:52 - worst case scenario you can watch the
06:54 - replay later okay so you can try your
06:56 - best to keep up with me you can always
06:58 - watch it later what i would say is just
07:00 - like main thing is you watch you you
07:02 - just look at a high level and understand
07:04 - what i'm doing oh he's writing these
07:06 - lines of code and it's doing this type
07:07 - of stuff on his screen cool like i'm
07:10 - getting coding i'm understanding it does
07:12 - that make sense guys
07:14 - then after today is done you can go hard
07:17 - and you can like finish it out later
07:19 - right after it's done break up into your
07:21 - groups team up with somebody and work
07:23 - alongside them and like finish the
07:25 - entire project out stay up late whatever
07:27 - the case may be so that by tomorrow
07:28 - you're done okay then you can go at your
07:31 - own pace the video is going to be
07:32 - recorded you could go slow it down break
07:34 - it up does that make sense guys
07:38 - so
07:40 - just giving you a heads up some of you
07:41 - might not be able to get node installed
07:43 - some of you may not be able to get
07:44 - metamask or or third web figured out
07:47 - some of you will fall off at like you
07:49 - know some lines of code it's okay just
07:52 - be prepared for that you can always do
07:55 - it later all right this is something
07:57 - difficult we're doing we're building a
07:58 - big project right
08:00 - so
08:01 - are all of you with me on that
08:04 - can i get an agreement on that if you're
08:06 - in agreement with me on that then we'll
08:08 - continue and actually get started
08:10 - yes with me agree let's do it
08:14 - okay omar says damn i clicked on the
08:16 - video out of curiosity
08:17 - and now i'm hooked fantastic amazing
08:20 - happy to hear that all right with that
08:23 - said
08:24 - let's just freaking go let's do this
08:26 - thing here we go
08:29 - all right guys
08:30 - so this is the project that we're gonna
08:31 - be building keep in mind we're gonna
08:33 - build this freaking thing from complete
08:35 - scratch okay
08:37 - that's our goal you guys can see the
08:39 - screen right give me a thumbs up if you
08:41 - can
08:42 - see the screen beautiful i'm gonna build
08:44 - this damn thing from scratch
08:47 - so
08:49 - uh first thing we're gonna do
08:51 - is uh let's go to third web all right we
08:54 - gave you guys a link to third web
08:58 - all right so this is the link we want
09:00 - you to use you can even copy paste this
09:02 - exact link this is really important
09:04 - because
09:05 - this is the link that works with clever
09:07 - programmer and that's the link that also
09:09 - gives you access to third web for free
09:11 - so make sure that's the link that you're
09:13 - using okay maybe we can drop it in a
09:15 - chat for everybody as well yeah we did
09:18 - okay
09:19 - and if we want to drop it on youtube as
09:21 - well
09:23 - we could do that i guess
09:25 - okay
09:27 - uh
09:29 - okay
09:30 - cool
09:31 - let's put that on youtube description so
09:33 - this is the one that you're gonna go to
09:37 - now what i'm just going to do is i'm
09:38 - going to just create a new account here
09:40 - on my meta mask so i just clicked on my
09:42 - meta mask and i'll just create a brand
09:45 - new account okay
09:46 - if you have a new account you you don't
09:48 - even need to do this but i'll just do
09:50 - this to keep everything super clean okay
09:52 - so i'm gonna say react.js
09:54 - and um
09:56 - december 11 okay december 11th just to
09:59 - keep it clean for me so i'll hit create
10:02 - okay now you see here i have rinky b
10:05 - test network this is very important that
10:07 - you actually get this right if you don't
10:09 - get this right it's not going to work a
10:10 - lot of you are probably going to be on
10:12 - ethereum mainnet
10:14 - okay
10:14 - here's what you need to do
10:16 - you see this over here where it says
10:18 - show and hide test networks
10:21 - right click that
10:24 - okay uh any of you guys with me so far
10:27 - if you are do let me know that you are
10:29 - doing this on meta mask and stuff
10:35 - okay and then toggle this on where it
10:38 - says
10:39 - uh
10:40 - show test networks
10:42 - once you turn this on show test networks
10:45 - now it will show up and you can actually
10:47 - choose rankinb test network okay
10:50 - so that's the one that you want to
10:51 - choose
10:54 - okay
10:56 - cool
10:56 - amazing now once we're done with that
10:58 - let's hit let's get started
11:00 - okay
11:01 - and hit connect wallet so i'm going to
11:04 - connect my wallet with metamask now for
11:06 - some reason it always brings up coinbase
11:08 - i'm going to deny because i don't want
11:10 - it to connect to my coinbase i just
11:11 - wanted to connect to my metamask
11:14 - and this is the wallet that i wanted to
11:16 - connect to so i'll hit next and i'll hit
11:18 - connect
11:20 - so now it's connected i'll hit continue
11:23 - now it's asking me which network i want
11:25 - to do so i'll say rinkeby
11:28 - okay
11:29 - cool if you're done then all good
11:31 - and then i'll just say create first
11:33 - project on rinkiby okay
11:35 - so that's it for now we're done with
11:37 - that now there was a little warning that
11:39 - came up that said hey you don't have any
11:41 - eath you don't have any ethereum so
11:44 - we're gonna get uh free ethereum today
11:46 - okay who wants some free ethereum
11:49 - hopefully that should excite everybody
11:52 - okay um so we're gonna get some free
11:55 - ethereum but this is a test network okay
11:58 - so what that means is it's fake ethereum
12:01 - that we're getting okay test so we're
12:03 - not moving any real money around so
12:05 - don't worry nothing is none of this is
12:06 - gonna cost you anything guess what guys
12:09 - everything today is going to be free
12:10 - that's going to be nice okay so you
12:12 - don't have to pay for anything
12:14 - okay so go to this link here
12:17 - faucets.chain.link slash rinkaby we'll
12:20 - drop it in zoom chat
12:22 - okay and we'll drop it on youtube as
12:24 - well let's put that link on youtube as
12:26 - well
12:29 - yeah wag me we're gonna make it that's
12:31 - right
12:32 - and uh we're gonna put our account
12:35 - address here
12:36 - all right so let's do that in just a
12:38 - second so create new project name and
12:41 - i'll just say cp punks
12:44 - let's hit create
12:47 - all right now it's going to ask me oh
12:48 - wait i can't create yet
12:50 - oh yeah right right right right right
12:52 - okay i'll hit reject on this for now and
12:55 - here's what we're gonna do we're gonna
12:56 - click our
12:58 - um
12:59 - we're gonna click our meta mask and
13:00 - click this over here and it's gonna
13:02 - allow you to copy it to clipboard okay
13:05 - now that it's copied i'm going to go
13:07 - back to faucets and i'm going to paste
13:09 - my address
13:10 - this is so it can send me free ethereum
13:12 - because i need it
13:15 - choose select 0.1 test eth okay
13:19 - and uncheck this box you just need this
13:21 - one checked hit i'm not a robot and then
13:24 - hit send request okay i'll zoom in so
13:26 - everybody can see clearly
13:30 - free eth
13:32 - yes
13:35 - okay beautiful
13:37 - wow that number hasn't dropped yet we
13:39 - are at 164 people on zoom still
13:41 - interesting how many people do we have
13:43 - on live
13:45 - 319 nice on youtube
13:49 - uh rinky's the network you're selecting
13:51 - if you want to select
13:54 - okay
13:55 - so you can see this transaction has
13:57 - initiated so it's going to take a second
13:59 - but it's going to send 0.1
14:02 - uh testnet eth to my account
14:06 - it's taking longer than usual so we'll
14:08 - just wait and see what happens
14:15 - david why is it taking so long is it
14:17 - because we're all jumping in it and
14:18 - doing it
14:20 - i mean i guess a thousand people are
14:22 - dripping
14:22 - [Music]
14:24 - or drip requests
14:26 - ah clarification expired wow we might
14:30 - have broken it guys unfortunately
14:37 - uh interesting
14:48 - all right let's give it a tr let's give
14:50 - it one more try
14:52 - if this doesn't work i'll have to use
14:54 - maybe a previous account of mine david
14:56 - maybe check out if there's other
14:58 - platforms as well that allow us to get
15:00 - free
15:01 - the reason why we need this is because
15:03 - when you're going to mint your project
15:05 - you're going to need like ethereum in
15:06 - there okay so that's why we need it
15:10 - you're going to need to pay gas fees and
15:11 - things like that
15:13 - um oh some some people got it already
15:18 - maybe this faucet
15:19 - [Music]
15:23 - yeah that's it for today
15:25 - thanks for coming everybody
15:29 - all right so if it does not work guys
15:31 - i'm just going to use my existing
15:33 - account
15:34 - and we'll go off of that
15:36 - unfortunately
15:40 - i think that's going to be the best way
15:44 - all right
15:45 - okay so let's uh let's go back to third
15:48 - web all right i will connect it to a
15:51 - different um
15:52 - wall oh causey yours just went through
15:55 - actually
15:56 - i saw some other people saying that even
15:58 - though the faucet said it failed
16:02 - the transaction went oh interesting yeah
16:04 - you're right
16:05 - zero points just double check yeah yeah
16:08 - okay okay so even though it said it
16:10 - failed that's a good point thank you
16:11 - david it actually looks like it it sent
16:13 - me 0.1 eth
16:16 - okay
16:16 - uh who did this work for already who has
16:19 - some eat like raise your hands if you
16:21 - have something
16:22 - use your hands
16:24 - okay we have a couple of people got some
16:26 - somebody 0.3 0.2
16:29 - okay beautiful
16:31 - yup
16:32 - awesome so cool so we got this working
16:34 - i'm going to call it cp punx and i'll
16:36 - hit create
16:38 - i'll hit next and connect
16:41 - so now my wallet and metamask is
16:42 - connected i'll hit confirm over here
16:45 - david you want to go ahead and mute
16:46 - yourself we can hear your typing
16:50 - it sounds nice though
16:52 - if you had a mechanical keyboard that
16:54 - would sound even nicer
17:01 - okay
17:02 - so
17:03 - while this project is happening all of
17:05 - these take a second to kind of get
17:07 - started
17:08 - but all we're doing right now is we're
17:10 - creating a new project okay and now
17:14 - inside of this project
17:16 - we'll be able to create new modules so
17:18 - i'll show you i just hit add module
17:20 - and uh there's six different options
17:22 - that we have here
17:24 - so you could create your own
17:25 - cryptocurrency right so for example
17:28 - you could call it whatever you want like
17:29 - chris taylor if chris taylor
17:32 - drops
17:33 - his um cryptocurrency you could
17:35 - literally call it chris taylor ct
17:38 - right and it would be
17:40 - competing with uh
17:42 - ethereum and and people would be able to
17:44 - buy it and get it and things like that
17:47 - you could also build your own
17:48 - marketplace which is like if you built
17:50 - your own open c the one thing that we're
17:52 - going to be looking at is nfts
17:55 - okay we're going to build our nft
17:56 - connect collection so click click this
17:59 - and just hit setup module
18:01 - all right and
18:04 - while we're setting this up
18:07 - all we're going to say here is again for
18:09 - me i think i'm just going to call it cp
18:11 - punx
18:13 - and it's asking me for an image and i'll
18:15 - just give it this image here you can
18:17 - give it whatever image you want i just
18:19 - had a couple of images that that i want
18:21 - to go with
18:22 - uh and in terms of these assets if you
18:24 - guys want access to these assets maybe
18:26 - david or amanath you maybe we want to
18:28 - give them the assets that they'll need
18:29 - later
18:32 - okay cool
18:34 - so
18:35 - yeah and for the symbol
18:37 - you know again it doesn't matter but
18:38 - i'll just call it like cp
18:41 - you know cpp for our cp punks
18:44 - um and i'll do 10 royalty but that none
18:47 - of that matters here because it's all
18:49 - free and
18:51 - uh it's on a test network so now it's
18:53 - asking me it's going to take some gas
18:55 - fee so i'll hit confirm
19:06 - and you'll see that with third web they
19:08 - make it so easy for you to actually just
19:10 - launch your own project and then to mint
19:13 - your own nfts it's
19:15 - you can do that all point and click and
19:16 - super fast
19:34 - mine is still creating a project it's
19:36 - all good
19:38 - okay
19:39 - awesome so now it's like hey mint your
19:42 - first nft so i'm gonna actually mint a
19:44 - couple of nfts here all this means is
19:46 - i'm creating my art i'm like putting up
19:48 - some of my art okay so i'm mint the
19:51 - process is called minting
19:54 - so i'm gonna get my first guy and we'll
19:56 - call the first guy let's say
19:59 - um
20:01 - bandana
20:02 - punk okay
20:04 - so it's going to be this guy right here
20:08 - and for price
20:11 - we'll we'll give him a property we'll
20:13 - give him a key price and the value we're
20:15 - going to give it is going to be like
20:17 - eight okay this this in my mind just
20:19 - represents like eight eth okay so hit
20:22 - mint nft
20:24 - this is gonna take a second it's also
20:26 - gonna charge you gas fees so just hit
20:28 - confirm on everything that pops up
20:31 - and again it's gonna take some time to
20:33 - load but once it's done what you're
20:35 - gonna see is you're gonna have uh
20:37 - some a minted you know bandana punk or
20:40 - whatever art you want right you could
20:42 - look up any type of art you could put
20:44 - your own face here if you wanted to and
20:46 - you could have your own type of nft
20:50 - my nfts is still loading so far so good
20:53 - nice
20:54 - okay so i got my first nft minted on
20:56 - here i'm gonna hit mint and um i'll drop
20:59 - another one i want a couple
21:02 - of them so i can actually use them right
21:04 - so let's call her
21:06 - what do i want to call her
21:08 - i feel like calling her cyberpunk
21:12 - will give her a price
21:15 - and for her price we will say and and
21:17 - make it all lower case right don't make
21:19 - it like
21:20 - uh uppercase price or whatever this will
21:22 - matter
21:23 - later on
21:25 - actually
21:26 - i don't think it will but but that's
21:28 - fine just make it all lower case for now
21:30 - and um i think she's gonna be a more
21:32 - expensive one like 13 eth so let's just
21:35 - put 13 here and we'll mint her
21:39 - what's cool about the blockchain is
21:41 - completely immutable right so once you
21:44 - actually put this on you can never edit
21:46 - this you can never ever delete this it's
21:50 - permanently there so for example all the
21:52 - crypto punks that are on there
21:54 - like they're just permanent they're
21:56 - never gonna go away the coding part
21:59 - is going to come up all right but first
22:01 - we just got to do all this setup
22:05 - all right i'm going to put a couple of
22:07 - other ones i'm going to mint a couple of
22:09 - other ones so this one is going to be
22:10 - called um
22:12 - you know the
22:15 - is that a cigar what is that thing
22:16 - called yeah let's just say
22:18 - cigar hat punk
22:21 - all right there we go and for price
22:24 - i don't know 90th for for this one
22:29 - you could add other properties in there
22:30 - as well like for example you could add
22:32 - the property like skin white you could
22:35 - add the property hat color blue you
22:37 - could add the property um cigar true
22:42 - and that might define like if it's more
22:44 - rare you know if this is something
22:46 - that's more rare that people might want
22:48 - to get
22:50 - because if you look at most other crypto
22:52 - punks or like most other nfts they have
22:54 - their own properties right
22:56 - okay
22:58 - anybody on this with me so far anybody
23:01 - doing any of this so far
23:03 - still creating a project
23:05 - go ahead yeah people are saying that the
23:07 - ethereum network is taking a lot
23:10 - to
23:11 - load
23:12 - yeah so
23:13 - okay
23:15 - okay
23:16 - um
23:20 - let's call him captain america
23:23 - punk
23:24 - okay
23:25 - just because i see red white blue and
23:28 - we'll say price
23:30 - let's make him uh 17 eth this one is
23:33 - pretty
23:34 - cool okay and uh we're generally we're
23:37 - just gonna mint two more nfts and then
23:40 - after that we should be good with this
23:42 - okay so
23:43 - whenever you guys get to this part just
23:45 - mint a couple of them and you should be
23:47 - good
23:49 - where am i grabbing the images from i
23:50 - just literally have a folder
23:53 - with six of these images which hopefully
23:55 - maybe a mononauth and david can give you
23:56 - guys
23:58 - um
23:59 - do you guys want me to drop these on
24:01 - slack and you guys can hand them this uh
24:04 - we like a monarch is dropping it
24:07 - oh so you guys have these images yep
24:10 - yep okay cool
24:12 - yeah so i'm literally just pulling them
24:14 - from there okay
24:16 - um
24:20 - all right and i will mint two two more
24:26 - all right there we go
24:29 - mint
24:31 - and we will do pirate king
24:35 - punk
24:37 - and let's go price let's make him 37 eth
24:43 - i mean that is one of the most lit ones
24:44 - right and maybe the crown is a super
24:46 - rare trait and that makes it
24:49 - a little bit more on the expensive side
24:51 - wow we're at 168 people on zoom
24:54 - and 315 we're starting to see some we're
24:57 - starting to see some droppers on youtube
24:59 - because youtube is going to be a more
25:01 - casual right for most people it's more
25:03 - casual platform so we're going to see
25:05 - some droppers but i'm really curious to
25:06 - see some droppers and when that starts
25:08 - actually on zoom because i know it's
25:09 - going to start
25:11 - i i predict it starts usually when you
25:13 - start coding
25:16 - so we'll be well about well we're about
25:18 - to start coding probably in like a
25:19 - minute or two
25:21 - we're very close to it
25:23 - okay and then let's just drop one more
25:25 - okay and um
25:28 - green
25:30 - um
25:31 - tennis hulk
25:33 - i don't know why that comes to my mind
25:35 - punk
25:36 - and uh for price we're just gonna say
25:39 - this is a 18th one okay we'll mint
25:46 - all right and i will accept
25:49 - all the fees
25:53 - okay
25:55 - it's ready to be minted
26:01 - okay so guys look at this we have our
26:04 - very first nft project we have it minted
26:06 - ready to go
26:08 - if you wanted you could actually go and
26:09 - uh
26:11 - tell your family members to buy it
26:14 - or friends so all right so we got all of
26:16 - our punks this is all i wanted for now
26:19 - six starts from zero that's why
26:22 - and um
26:24 - you can see they're all owned by this
26:26 - wallet address which in this case is me
26:29 - okay
26:30 - so i am uh good on this side
26:36 - i'm going to close the slides over here
26:39 - all right and now
26:43 - make this a little bit smaller so you
26:44 - all can see
26:46 - okay
26:48 - and now i'm ready to get my project
26:49 - started
26:50 - okay i'll create a folder if you're on
26:52 - windows you probably have to do mkdir
26:54 - but i'll just md
26:56 - and we'll say
26:58 - react nft
27:01 - challenge
27:02 - okay and i'll just go in that folder
27:05 - nfte challenge
27:07 - you guys don't need to go into any
27:09 - folders if you don't want to or you
27:11 - don't know how to you can just do npx
27:13 - create react app no matter where you are
27:15 - all right and i'm just going to call
27:17 - this the same thing as the folder and
27:20 - we'll just say react nft
27:22 - challenge
27:24 - i'll just hit enter
27:28 - and so now what's happening is i'm
27:30 - getting my react project started okay
27:32 - it's installing my react project
27:34 - and then that essentially means that
27:36 - i'll be able to start coding now okay
27:40 - just getting it completely set up
27:45 - just long load for it to mint okay where
27:47 - do we get the images we're giving you
27:49 - guys links so you guys can download it
27:51 - finally got some eth going to watch for
27:53 - now but it's making sense julia awesome
27:55 - happy to hear that
27:57 - ben carter says why not using next.js
27:59 - just because we wanted it to be a little
28:00 - bit simpler for everybody to follow
28:02 - along
28:03 - initially when we were actually doing
28:05 - this project when we built it we did use
28:07 - next but we switched it over to react
28:09 - just to keep it simple
28:13 - we might give you guys the github url
28:16 - okay
28:18 - but not right now right now i just need
28:20 - all of you guys to focus and try to get
28:23 - it
28:24 - or just focus on watching it
28:29 - yeah ben there you go
28:31 - okay so i got this
28:33 - okay now all i need to do
28:37 - is open up my vs code which i just did
28:39 - right here i'll hit command o you can do
28:42 - control o on windows
28:44 - i'll go to my github folder we'll go to
28:48 - uh
28:49 - right here
28:50 - and this is the folder that you want to
28:52 - open okay this is a folder do not open
28:54 - this folder right there
28:56 - select this one all right this is what
28:59 - it should look like
29:01 - cool click it open
29:05 - now i don't need my command line anymore
29:06 - so just closed out of it
29:08 - and
29:12 - let's go right here
29:16 - okay
29:17 - let's hit
29:18 - app.js
29:22 - i just invited you david
29:26 - okay let's zoom in so you guys can see
29:28 - it maybe a little bit more clearer
29:31 - uh do you guys need me to zoom in more
29:32 - or is this good enough
29:36 - if this is good enough do let me know
29:43 - this is good enough give me a thumbs up
29:45 - or something
29:46 - okay perfect
29:51 - awesome
29:52 - yeah my react app downloaded fast
29:55 - okay awesome so now what i need to do
29:57 - guys is i'm just gonna pretty much
30:00 - remove everything
30:01 - from my app uh js i don't really
30:04 - like all the stuff that's inside of this
30:07 - return here right i don't need that okay
30:10 - but actually before you before you
30:11 - actually do that hold on hold on don't
30:12 - delete that yet just undo just real
30:14 - quick because i want to show you how to
30:16 - actually run your app okay so i'll hit
30:18 - yarn start here
30:20 - you could you could do npm start or you
30:22 - could do yarn start both will work for
30:24 - you
30:25 - okay
30:26 - and um
30:28 - it will open up for you
30:31 - in like a local host something okay so
30:33 - i'll go right here
30:36 - so for you it'll probably be localhost
30:39 - colon 3000 okay
30:42 - don't worry about why it's 3001 for me
30:44 - but it should be 3 000 for you okay it
30:47 - will also tell you here
30:49 - and this will get you to just run a
30:51 - normal react app right this is just the
30:53 - most bare-bone type of app that you
30:55 - could have
30:57 - now i'm going to remove all of this
30:58 - because i don't need it and we're going
31:00 - to start working on our header so when i
31:03 - say header i'm actually talking about
31:06 - this guy right here does that make sense
31:08 - guys when i say header right that's the
31:12 - header
31:14 - and this file is going to be called
31:15 - header.js actually
31:18 - okay
31:21 - so that's what we're gonna do
31:23 - i will take all of this and delete it
31:26 - okay
31:27 - and i will say header and now what's
31:30 - gonna happen is my app is going to break
31:31 - because it's going to be like i don't
31:33 - know what you're talking about
31:35 - about this header thing and we're going
31:37 - to say that's fine you don't need to
31:38 - know what i'm talking about because i
31:39 - haven't created it yet so i'm going to
31:41 - go into my source and i'm going to
31:42 - create a new folder i'll call it
31:44 - components and then inside of components
31:47 - i'll actually create a new file and
31:49 - it'll be called header.js
31:52 - here i can use a snippet which is rafce
31:57 - and hit tab and it'll auto-complete it
32:00 - if you don't have this snippet you could
32:02 - do command shift x go to your extensions
32:05 - and you could get a react snippets i
32:07 - believe it's called something like that
32:10 - yeah es7 snippets and just get this
32:12 - extension once you have this extension
32:15 - you'll have the same snippets that i
32:17 - have
32:19 - okay
32:19 - so
32:20 - now that i've done this i can just go
32:23 - you know i can do a h2 here and i can
32:25 - say
32:27 - i'm the header
32:31 - okay
32:33 - again if i'm going fast that's just
32:35 - because we want to get all of this
32:37 - covered in one day okay so
32:41 - yeah all right so let's go back to app
32:43 - here now what we need to do is you can
32:45 - just remove this character r here write
32:47 - it again it should ask you for this auto
32:50 - import hit enter
32:51 - and uh now you've imported your header
32:54 - so basically what we have done is we
32:56 - created our header component
32:58 - right and then we took it and we moved
33:00 - it to app.js
33:03 - i love the speed okay nice
33:06 - happy to hear that ah we got our first
33:08 - droppers guys everybody give it up i
33:11 - want to see you clapping for the first
33:13 - few droppers let's give it up yeah i
33:15 - want to see you all
33:16 - give it up guys
33:18 - give it up
33:19 - beautiful we got our first few droppers
33:21 - we're down to 160. okay this is what i'm
33:23 - looking for the more we get into coding
33:25 - the more it happens okay so
33:27 - um it's all good here we go so now i'm
33:31 - the header is popping up
33:33 - there's some weird margins around that i
33:35 - don't like and we don't really need them
33:37 - so i'm going to go to my index.css
33:40 - and in my index css all the way at the
33:43 - top
33:44 - all i want to do is i just want to say
33:46 - star like grab everything and i want to
33:48 - go margin 0 and i want to go padding 0
33:51 - and now all those like weird
33:53 - margins are gone because
33:55 - we don't need them right so gone
33:59 - the next thing we need to do
34:00 - is uh change the background color right
34:03 - what's the background color
34:06 - on my current app here and what's the
34:08 - background color on my final app
34:12 - this is the final app right so what's
34:14 - the background color here guys
34:16 - that's what the background color we need
34:18 - to have here so let's go to app.css
34:21 - okay
34:22 - and
34:23 - in our app.css we're going to do a
34:25 - couple of things let's make this a
34:27 - lowercase app first of all not
34:29 - uppercase and let's delete everything
34:31 - else
34:32 - besides that so let's just have this
34:35 - here
34:36 - i'm going to go to myapp.js and we're
34:38 - going to wrap this header in a div
34:42 - all right and this div will have a class
34:44 - name
34:45 - of app and we'll end it right there
34:48 - so
34:49 - in app.js you should just have
34:52 - a div that's called app
34:54 - with a header
34:55 - the reason for this is so we can now
34:57 - select this app and and basically style
35:00 - it right so let's go back to our app.css
35:04 - and we're going to start styling this
35:06 - okay so we have text align center but we
35:08 - don't need that so let's remove that
35:11 - all right and i'm going to say
35:13 - background color
35:15 - and we'll give it black
35:19 - perfect
35:22 - coding is what i'm here for this is dope
35:24 - okay beautiful
35:31 - yeah all right the next one so now what
35:33 - i'm going to do is i'm just going to say
35:35 - padding of 20 pixels so everything i
35:37 - want to kind of give it some padding
35:39 - okay and let's just go here let's see
35:41 - yeah so we have imported app.css so
35:44 - that's perfectly fine
35:46 - and then i want to say min height
35:48 - we'll go 100 vh
35:51 - and we'll go max with and we'll go 100
35:54 - vw
35:57 - just like this okay let's refresh
36:00 - all right so now that i've refreshed you
36:01 - can actually see the background color is
36:03 - black well where did my text go
36:06 - didn't i have text here
36:08 - what happened to it guys
36:11 - why is my text not showing up
36:15 - why is my text hidden
36:18 - it poofed
36:19 - yes the text is black that's why it's
36:22 - hidden right so i need to actually grab
36:24 - this text and make it white so i'll go
36:26 - to my header here
36:28 - and we'll wrap this in a div
36:32 - all right
36:37 - like that
36:38 - i'll wrap this in a div and we'll
36:40 - actually just give it a class name
36:44 - and what's the class name we should give
36:45 - it here guys what will make a lot of
36:48 - sense what should i call this class name
36:49 - here i'll give you a hint
36:51 - it's one of the words in here
36:54 - can you guess
36:57 - we'll call it header okay
37:00 - and now
37:02 - david nice
37:04 - and now we're gonna basically go inside
37:07 - and what we're going to do is we're
37:08 - going to create a new file and we'll
37:09 - call this header.css okay let's go
37:12 - header
37:13 - dot css
37:15 - and in here what i want to say is
37:20 - let's grab our header
37:25 - and what we'll do is we'll give it a
37:27 - color
37:28 - white okay let's go white like this
37:33 - all right
37:35 - okay once we're done giving it that
37:37 - color let's go back
37:40 - yep let's put a dot here because we're
37:43 - actually getting a class
37:46 - and the reason why it's not showing up
37:48 - is because we haven't imported this yet
37:50 - so let's go import
37:53 - header
37:55 - dot css
37:57 - boom there we go okay now we've imported
37:59 - it so now it shows up
38:02 - and there's a couple of other things we
38:03 - want to do to the header as well we want
38:05 - to give it a height because this will be
38:07 - useful
38:08 - um for later once we add all the other
38:10 - things inside of it because we're going
38:12 - to be adding the search bar and things
38:14 - like that let's give it a display of
38:16 - flex
38:17 - okay and this will make sense
38:19 - in a second too once we start actually
38:21 - adding
38:22 - other things to the header okay so for
38:25 - example if i took away this display flex
38:27 - you'll see what i mean okay so i'll add
38:29 - a couple of more things here so right
38:30 - underneath the header
38:33 - um i don't need this i'm the header
38:36 - anymore what i do need though is this
38:39 - cryptopunx
38:41 - logo right there okay that's that's what
38:43 - i need
38:44 - so i'm going to remove this
38:47 - and i will say
38:50 - class name
38:51 - and we'll have it be the logo container
38:54 - and inside of my logo container i'm just
38:56 - going to have an image
39:00 - and this is going to be my punk logo
39:03 - okay and then i'll give it a class name
39:07 - of punk logo as well
39:10 - now this image you might be like hey
39:11 - where is this image coming from causey
39:13 - i'm getting an error so now i'll show
39:15 - you what we need to do so in our source
39:17 - folder we actually need to create a
39:20 - folder
39:21 - and we want to call it assets
39:23 - okay inside of our assets we need to put
39:25 - all of our assets so i'll show you what
39:27 - that means
39:28 - okay
39:29 - so i'm grabbing all of my assets and i'm
39:31 - putting them in here
39:33 - okay i just moved them right now for you
39:36 - guys how you can actually do this is
39:38 - we've given you a google drive link with
39:40 - all of the assets so if you're watching
39:42 - this on youtube or zoom
39:43 - you will have access to all of these
39:45 - assets once you download it and what are
39:47 - these assets these assets are the images
39:49 - that we're going to need for this
39:51 - project for example
39:53 - this ethereum image
39:55 - is an asset you're going to need access
39:58 - to
39:59 - these images right this logo right here
40:02 - you're going to need access to this
40:04 - search icon right here okay
40:08 - all of this all of these are are an
40:10 - asset right and just to highlight a
40:12 - little bit more about the project right
40:14 - as as we go through it it's like think
40:15 - about it
40:16 - how how does like when i click here it
40:19 - changes this
40:21 - how is that happening and that's
40:23 - happening without any refresh or
40:25 - anything how come like when i'm
40:26 - scrolling how can i scroll all the way
40:29 - like this
40:30 - right all of these things are
40:33 - like require you to have a lot of
40:35 - front-end skills
40:37 - you know if you look at this button
40:38 - right over here it has this beautiful
40:39 - gradient how's that gradient there how
40:42 - do you add a gradient
40:43 - how does this have this circular
40:44 - background
40:46 - with that right there how come like all
40:48 - of these have these gaps these nice gaps
40:51 - in between and it gives us this nice
40:53 - spacing
40:55 - okay all of this stuff is
40:58 - super powerful right um and we're gonna
41:01 - walk you through how to do this
41:03 - okay so it goes i don't know the punk
41:04 - logo and what that is well that's not a
41:07 - problem we're simply just actually going
41:08 - to
41:10 - import it alright so what i'm going to
41:12 - do
41:13 - is i'll say import
41:16 - punk logo
41:17 - from
41:19 - and we'll go into our assets go into our
41:21 - header folder
41:22 - and it's actually right here this is the
41:26 - logo that we need it's right there
41:28 - okay so now
41:30 - i'll say
41:32 - crypto
41:34 - punk
41:37 - dash logo dot png
41:41 - okay so there we go
41:43 - now it's showing up
41:46 - okay
41:47 - so while you guys are watching this
41:50 - and even if it seems like it's difficult
41:52 - or you guys are not able to keep up
41:54 - because i know that that's fine that's
41:56 - normal
41:58 - when i'm adding for example this image
42:01 - right here
42:02 - or i'm i'm putting this image right
42:05 - there like does that make sense to you
42:07 - guys
42:08 - how i'm at least like maybe pulling this
42:10 - image and how this
42:12 - this line of code right here is
42:14 - literally what's bringing this image
42:16 - right here does that type of stuff make
42:17 - sense
42:19 - okay great
42:20 - so
42:21 - yeah kind of some people saying kind of
42:23 - some people say yes yes yes absolutely
42:25 - so yeah just totally normal okay so
42:28 - um my main goal is that you kind of at a
42:31 - high level
42:32 - understand what's going on
42:35 - okay
42:36 - awesome
42:38 - yeah one dot can make the difference
42:40 - which is why i think it's a good idea
42:41 - that you watch it later too at some
42:43 - point right and then go through it
42:45 - because i think that'll help uh that'll
42:46 - help you out a lot
42:49 - all right um amazing so we got this uh
42:52 - we got this right here now now we do
42:55 - need to change its size because i think
42:56 - it's still a little bit like a little
42:58 - bit big so i do want it to kind of
43:01 - become
43:02 - uh smaller now
43:04 - so let's go inside of our header
43:07 - and i'm going to just say logo
43:10 - container
43:12 - okay uh or actually
43:14 - i'm just gonna say punk logo
43:17 - and we'll make it its width 200 pixels
43:21 - all right now the reason why i didn't do
43:24 - anything is because we do need to um
43:28 - yeah so we actually have punk logo right
43:30 - there so that's fine
43:32 - let's go back punk logo with 200 pixels
43:37 - okay refresh
43:39 - there we go okay i just had to refresh
43:42 - so we selected this guy right here and
43:44 - we made it a little bit smaller
43:47 - okay
43:48 - next thing that we want to add guys
43:50 - what's the next thing in the header that
43:52 - we need to add so we just got done
43:54 - adding the logo so that's great but
43:56 - what's the next thing that we do need to
43:58 - add
43:59 - just visually
44:00 - yes exactly
44:02 - search bar right search bar is the next
44:04 - thing that we need to add so let's get
44:05 - to work on the search bar real quick
44:09 - so what i'm going to do is this is my
44:12 - header
44:13 - and this over here is my logo container
44:16 - now i'm going to go and start working on
44:18 - another div
44:20 - what's going to be the name of what's
44:22 - gonna be the class name can you guys
44:23 - guess
44:25 - so for example this was called this was
44:27 - a logo one right what's this one gonna
44:29 - be called
44:30 - you have to get the exact name right but
44:32 - if you just get certain parts of it
44:33 - right that's great so yeah search
44:35 - container is great search bar is great
44:37 - i'm just going to call it search bar if
44:39 - you got any of those great job you're
44:40 - you're you did fantastic okay
44:43 - um
44:45 - and then inside of it i'm going to
44:46 - create another div and this div is going
44:48 - to be there to hold
44:50 - this icon
44:52 - okay
44:53 - so what should i name this
44:56 - search icon
44:58 - container okay hopefully you guys are on
44:59 - the right track
45:01 - search icon beautiful okay awesome
45:04 - and then we're gonna give it an image
45:07 - right and for source i'm gonna give it
45:09 - search
45:10 - icon like this
45:12 - okay and then i don't need the alt tag
45:14 - now the search icon i also need to
45:16 - import it because otherwise it's going
45:18 - to give me an error
45:21 - so i have if i go into header i have
45:23 - search right there i'll just copy the
45:25 - relative path
45:27 - and i'll go here and i'll say import
45:30 - search icon from
45:32 - and i'll paste the relative path
45:35 - i'll replace the source with the dot dot
45:40 - and there we go
45:41 - okay search icon and search icon right
45:44 - there if i hit refresh it should work
45:46 - beautiful so now as you can see
45:49 - i have the search icon showing up
45:54 - and the last thing i want to do is i
45:56 - also want to put input in the search bar
45:59 - so we can actually take in some input so
46:01 - let's do input
46:07 - all right
46:08 - and we will give it a class name what's
46:10 - the class name that i should give the
46:12 - input bar what should i give this
46:18 - search input
46:19 - joe diaz asks are you destructuring i'm
46:22 - not doing any destructuring yet by the
46:24 - way i'm not doing any destructuring at
46:25 - all
46:26 - this here is
46:28 - just pulling um
46:31 - it's just using this variable right
46:32 - there
46:33 - okay
46:35 - it this here is literally the same thing
46:38 - as if i had just like
46:40 - copied this and pasted that right there
46:43 - okay it's kind of like that
46:45 - okay even though that's not gonna work
46:47 - but it's kind of like that
46:49 - okay so let's go back
46:53 - um
46:54 - and i'm putting the squigglies
46:56 - all right because i'm basically saying
46:58 - this is javascript that i'm about to
47:00 - write
47:02 - all right
47:04 - so i got my search input
47:07 - and then i'm going to give it a
47:08 - placeholder and we'll give it a
47:10 - placeholder of
47:12 - we'll say collection
47:14 - item or user dot dot dot just like this
47:18 - okay
47:19 - does this look good guys
47:20 - is this looking amazing
47:24 - this is kind of what we were after
47:29 - so now we want to work on and make it
47:31 - look amazing okay so let's go back to
47:33 - our header
47:34 - okay and
47:36 - what we want to do is let's go and make
47:39 - it display flex so first thing we need
47:40 - to do is put it in a row
47:42 - right it was showing up as columns
47:44 - that's not what we want we need it to be
47:45 - a row
47:46 - next up after that we need to actually
47:49 - give it a space between so you saw how
47:52 - it just gave it some spacing i know it's
47:54 - crazy right now but once we add other
47:56 - items it'll space it out evenly
47:59 - after this let's go align items and
48:01 - let's go center
48:02 - okay so this will vertically center this
48:05 - so it's not like up here
48:07 - okay
48:10 - next up we'll take the header
48:13 - and i'm going to give it a margin
48:16 - of 10 pixels
48:18 - okay cool
48:20 - so i basically grabbed these divs right
48:23 - and i
48:24 - gave some margin around so like some
48:26 - margin here here here and stuff like
48:28 - that
48:30 - okay so they moved like a little bit
48:32 - more inward so to speak okay
48:35 - the next thing i kind of want to do now
48:37 - is i want to start um
48:40 - doing stuff to my search bar so it looks
48:42 - nice so let's grab our search bar and
48:44 - let's give it a background color
48:47 - of we're going to go 1 c 1 c 1 e
48:52 - okay so you can start to see that color
48:54 - right there even though it's obviously
48:56 - you know not super
48:57 - super clear but you can you can start to
49:00 - see it
49:02 - we're going to give it a height of 50
49:05 - pixels
49:07 - i'll give it a flex of 1 and flex of 1
49:10 - makes it really long okay so you see
49:12 - that it just takes up all of the space
49:14 - because that's what we wanted to do
49:16 - right when i go when i make the screen
49:18 - bigger or smaller
49:20 - take a look at how this bar dynamically
49:23 - keeps moving
49:24 - right this is happening because we have
49:26 - done flex one
49:31 - i also want to enable flex mode on this
49:34 - and what we're going to do is now we
49:36 - want to give it some rounded corners
49:39 - so now this just gave it some nice
49:41 - rounded
49:42 - corners and i'll do align items
49:47 - and we'll go center
49:50 - okay
49:51 - so now is it starting to look a little
49:53 - bit better now guys does this look a
49:55 - little bit better than what we had
49:57 - before
49:59 - still not finished right but hopefully
50:02 - yeah it's looking a little bit better
50:03 - thank god for flexbox fire
50:06 - nice
50:07 - we're one step closer
50:09 - beautiful
50:11 - displayed flexi
50:16 - yes okay
50:19 - um let's get the search icon container
50:21 - and we'll put some margins around it
50:23 - right because you see how it's too close
50:25 - to the boundaries edges we don't like
50:27 - that
50:28 - so we want to actually do something
50:30 - about it so let's grab the container and
50:32 - we'll go margin
50:33 - 10 pixels
50:35 - all right there we go now you can see
50:37 - that there's some margin here and here
50:40 - okay
50:42 - the next thing we need to do is grab the
50:43 - search input and change its styling so
50:46 - first we're gonna do the background
50:48 - color and we're gonna make the
50:49 - background color transparent because we
50:51 - don't want it to have background color
50:53 - it still looks
50:54 - kind of hideous right so this is a this
50:57 - is called border we want to remove its
51:00 - border so let's go ahead and let's add a
51:02 - property called border and let's say
51:04 - none
51:06 - done it's gone
51:07 - now you guys see the you guys see when i
51:10 - select it it's only like this much
51:13 - that's kind of annoying right because
51:14 - when i start typing it'll only type
51:16 - within that
51:18 - so let's give it a width
51:22 - let's give it a width of a hundred
51:24 - percent
51:26 - all right so now when i click it
51:28 - wow it spans all the way across you know
51:30 - this is kind of what we wanted
51:31 - now the blue thing that that it
51:33 - highlights when we click it's called
51:35 - outline so what are we going to do with
51:37 - outline guys to make it go away i'll
51:39 - give you a hint it's just like how we
51:40 - made the border go away
51:44 - yes absolutely nice job anthony good job
51:48 - yes good job angel good job venky say
51:51 - great job perfect
51:54 - i'm gonna make it go away
51:56 - all right so let's go here
51:58 - boom now none of it is there anymore
52:00 - that's what we were looking for
52:03 - color we're going to give the text color
52:05 - we're going to give it off white
52:07 - all right
52:09 - so now when i click
52:11 - look at that it's showing up
52:14 - okay
52:16 - beautiful
52:19 - and uh let's give it a font
52:22 - size of
52:24 - 16.
52:26 - all right
52:28 - there we go now i'm able to write
52:30 - throughout it and it does work exactly
52:33 - how i want it to work
52:35 - does this look better guys does this
52:37 - look a lot better than before
52:40 - if you think it does give me a thumbs up
52:43 - but with that said we're done with the
52:45 - logo and we're done with the search bar
52:47 - guys we've already made a whole bunch of
52:49 - progress so if you've been watching it
52:52 - great job because you're learning okay
52:54 - even if you're not maybe doing it you're
52:56 - just watching trust me you're
52:58 - learning awesome
53:00 - now
53:02 - we need to add these okay so we're going
53:04 - to call these
53:06 - right here
53:07 - all right we're going to decide to call
53:09 - these header
53:12 - header items okay that's what we're
53:14 - gonna call them
53:19 - so let's work on our header items now so
53:21 - let's go back to header.js
53:24 - and
53:25 - we're done with the search bar
53:29 - all right and let's go and do this
53:31 - so i'll say div
53:35 - okay and
53:37 - what's the class name gonna be called
53:39 - guys can you guess
53:40 - class name what are we gonna call it
53:43 - what are we gonna call it
53:47 - header items great job
53:50 - wow we have a seven-year-old on here
53:52 - let's go
53:54 - monkey typist on youtube says
53:57 - i'm seven years old and you teach me a
53:59 - lot
54:01 - hey
54:02 - much love thank you so much for being on
54:03 - here appreciate it
54:06 - awesome so we got that done header items
54:09 - let's go in here
54:10 - and header items has a couple of header
54:13 - items has a couple of things okay
54:16 - it has
54:17 - three p tags one is drops
54:20 - the other is marketplace
54:23 - and then the other one after that is
54:25 - create
54:27 - all right
54:28 - it's these three guys right here so i
54:31 - just added them in
54:32 - this is what they look like
54:34 - all right does anybody have any idea how
54:36 - we can take them from a column and put
54:38 - them in a row
54:41 - let's go back to header css
54:44 - yes display flex great work guys so
54:47 - we're gonna go dot header items
54:50 - right and i'll go display flex
54:56 - okay
54:57 - uh display flex
55:02 - and let's refresh
55:03 - there we go
55:04 - now it's showing up in a row but if you
55:07 - actually notice it's showing up in a row
55:09 - but it's all attached to each other so
55:11 - we actually don't want that
55:14 - so what we're going to do
55:15 - for this and some of you guys are going
55:17 - to actually fall for this trap because
55:19 - some of you guys are gonna actually say
55:21 - okay let me ask you how would you put a
55:23 - space in between all of those
55:27 - okay
55:28 - i'll go to the answer
55:31 - yes so space evenly space between
55:33 - normally that would work but in this
55:35 - case it actually does not work okay so
55:38 - it's a trick question but if you did say
55:40 - space between you you are right normally
55:42 - that would work but in this case isaac
55:44 - great great job but it doesn't work just
55:46 - in this case okay normally that would
55:48 - work so
55:50 - let's give it a color though
55:53 - and i'll show you what does work it's
55:55 - because of the flex 1 that we did on the
55:57 - search bar that's what kind of tripped
55:58 - it up a little bit okay so we're going
55:59 - to do dot header items
56:01 - and we got a little hacky way of doing
56:03 - this
56:04 - we're gonna grab the p tags and in
56:06 - between the p tags we're just gonna add
56:08 - some margins
56:10 - right so let's refresh
56:12 - boom there we go all right so we just
56:14 - grabbed these p tags and we said in
56:15 - between all of them add some margin okay
56:18 - so that was a simple way of doing it
56:22 - gave it some nice spacing
56:24 - i know tricky question we got you guys
56:27 - so with that said we're done with header
56:29 - items guys we're flying through this
56:31 - right before we even realize we're done
56:34 - now the next things that we're going to
56:35 - build are going to be called header
56:37 - actions
56:38 - so these guys right here
56:40 - we're going to call it header actions
56:42 - header actions like this
56:44 - all right
56:47 - so let's work on that
56:49 - boom
56:51 - okay header items we're done with
56:55 - yeah look at that specificity beautiful
56:58 - yeah chris you like that specificity huh
57:00 - nice sarah is giving us a round of
57:02 - applause thank you sarah for the love
57:05 - all right here we go so i'm gonna create
57:07 - a div here and we'll say class name and
57:09 - what's the class name for this guys
57:12 - we're going to be creating the header
57:14 - actions this is going to be called
57:16 - header actions beautiful great job
57:21 - and then inside of it
57:23 - okay we're going to do another class
57:24 - name and i'll give you a hint
57:28 - we need to
57:30 - this logo right here
57:32 - all right this is our theme theme switch
57:35 - logo okay
57:37 - we need to put it in a container all
57:40 - right so we're gonna call this what
57:43 - should we call this
57:46 - the class name for this should be called
57:47 - what
57:53 - theme switch
57:54 - logo container yeah exactly something
57:56 - along those lines so we're going to say
57:58 - theme switch container okay fantastic
58:01 - you're on the right track theo good job
58:03 - even if you said dark mode container
58:05 - good job chris that's pretty much right
58:07 - theme switcher yeah
58:09 - all of those are along the right tracks
58:10 - okay
58:12 - and then here i'm gonna put an image
58:15 - all right and uh we're actually gonna
58:17 - use this image theme switch icon
58:20 - okay
58:21 - and of course we're gonna get this from
58:24 - this import right here so i'm gonna say
58:25 - import theme switch icon
58:28 - from
58:29 - dot dot slash assets header theme switch
58:31 - dot jpeg or png which is coming from
58:34 - right there
58:36 - all right
58:38 - okay
58:39 - so let's see if that worked
58:41 - let's go back here and boom it's there
58:44 - is it looking like how we want it to
58:46 - look though what's the difference
58:48 - between this one and this one this one
58:51 - and this one quickly guys what's the
58:53 - difference everybody if you're in here
58:55 - drop it in the comments below let me
58:57 - know okay drop in the comments below
58:59 - come on all of you guys can do that i
59:00 - want to read it from you guys size is
59:02 - the difference yes what else
59:04 - size and background good job monica what
59:06 - else
59:07 - no radius on the container yes raul good
59:10 - eyesight good job
59:12 - size and border yes rondelle fantastic
59:15 - background circle size good job evie
59:19 - yes
59:20 - background radius and color gerardo good
59:22 - job
59:24 - so yes those are the things not cursor
59:26 - pointer though that's not the difference
59:28 - but yeah those are the differences okay
59:29 - so we need to make it
59:31 - smaller size
59:32 - we need to give it this border radius
59:35 - right so we need to do all of those
59:36 - things
59:37 - so let's get to work on it
59:41 - and the color too so somebody caught
59:43 - that good job on that
59:45 - all right so let's go ahead and style
59:47 - this alright so let's go to header css
59:51 - and here's how we're going to do this
59:53 - right so header
59:55 - items we did it now we need to style our
59:58 - header actions so let's go ahead and
60:00 - let's do header actions
60:01 - and we'll say display flex
60:04 - all right and i'll give it a line item
60:07 - center
60:09 - okay so
60:10 - we just centered it and everything and
60:13 - so that's that's good enough right there
60:15 - okay
60:17 - um and then we're gonna use the same
60:19 - hack for this as well header actions
60:21 - because i need to still add in one more
60:23 - thing so we'll give it a margin of 10
60:25 - pixels here
60:26 - okay so that basically what that will do
60:29 - is when i add in the button here it'll
60:31 - give spacing in between that button
60:35 - and the moon
60:38 - theme switch icon
60:40 - all right so now we're going to get to
60:41 - work on the theme switch container
60:46 - and in here we're going to start off by
60:48 - doing display flex
60:51 - okay let's give it a background color
60:56 - and this background color is going to be
60:58 - the 1c1c1e
61:01 - that we gave earlier so let's go see all
61:03 - right can you guys see that little um
61:06 - like gray background like the square one
61:09 - are you guys able to see it
61:11 - yeah okay i'm seeing some heads nodding
61:14 - okay good you guys can see it awesome
61:17 - 144 yeah the number is dropping keep an
61:20 - eye on that the deeper we go into this
61:22 - it keeps dropping
61:23 - it's still not as bad though so that's
61:25 - that's pretty good i got to give you
61:26 - guys props a lot of you are like
61:29 - championing through this a good job on
61:30 - that so yeah this that's what we got now
61:33 - how do we make that circular does
61:35 - anybody have any idea
61:37 - yes gerardo you're on the money great
61:39 - work buddy border radius and i'll just
61:42 - give it a 50
61:44 - pixel border radius here
61:47 - all right so there we go we got that
61:48 - circle
61:49 - now notice right this circle has so much
61:52 - spacing around it yet this circle has no
61:55 - spacing
61:56 - and what i mean is
61:59 - the logo right is there's a lot of
62:01 - distance between
62:02 - here
62:03 - there's no distance between the logo and
62:05 - the circle like they're touching each
62:07 - other how do we fix that
62:11 - yes padding if if
62:14 - i know a few of you guys are going to be
62:15 - here and you're going to be like how the
62:17 - hell does everybody know every answer
62:19 - and i feel like i don't do you feel like
62:21 - that right now is there anybody that
62:23 - feels like that right now like how come
62:25 - everybody knows all these answers
62:27 - um
62:28 - crystal yeah
62:30 - don't let these fools intimidate you
62:32 - they've just spent more time sucking at
62:34 - coding and failing more than you okay
62:36 - that's all that's all that has happened
62:38 - they're not any different than you
62:39 - they're not smarter than you i freaking
62:41 - promise you they've just
62:43 - banged their heads against the wall more
62:46 - than you they've cried more tears than
62:48 - you
62:49 - coding failing and things breaking
62:52 - and and that's all okay so don't take it
62:55 - as a thing of you're dumber than them or
62:57 - whatever that that's not what it is
62:59 - okay
63:00 - just want to put that out there for
63:02 - everybody
63:04 - okay cool
63:06 - so we got the padding that's good
63:09 - now we need to centralize everything so
63:11 - we're going to go justify content and
63:13 - i'm going to center it let's go align
63:15 - items and center it align items
63:18 - vertically centers things justify
63:19 - content horizontally centers things
63:23 - the other thing i want to say is object
63:25 - fit
63:26 - contain this will like contain the image
63:29 - and make it look a lot nicer okay so
63:32 - we'll show you guys that in just a
63:34 - second so we got object fit contain
63:37 - we got the border radius on this thing
63:39 - okay cool
63:41 - and then we want to like make the image
63:43 - smaller here okay so let's go ahead
63:45 - let's grab it let's grab the image so
63:48 - let's go after that specificity that
63:49 - taylor
63:50 - chris likes okay
63:52 - and we'll go height and we'll go 25
63:55 - pixels
63:56 - and if we go back
63:58 - what is happening here boom there we go
64:01 - right

65:23 - in real quick so let's go back to our
65:25 - header
65:26 - okay
65:28 - and let me ask you guys this is this
65:30 - button we're gonna add is this gonna go
65:31 - inside of the header or it's gonna go
65:33 - outside of the header
65:36 - quick question not trying to trick you
65:40 - okay so far we've put the logo container
65:42 - inside of the header the search bar
65:44 - inside of the header the search input
65:46 - inside of the header header items inside
65:48 - of the header header actions inside of
65:50 - the header
65:51 - is this gonna go inside or outside
65:57 - okay it's gonna go inside okay
66:00 - just because all of this remember
66:02 - earlier i told you guys it's part of the
66:03 - header if you got it wrong it's all good
66:06 - isaiah says i can understand what you're
66:07 - doing but i can't keep up it's all good
66:08 - bro i'm gonna be i'm telling you guys
66:10 - i'm gonna be going fast and it's gonna
66:12 - get faster than this
66:14 - uh just because i want to cover it all
66:16 - in a you know short enough time span
66:19 - because i don't want you guys to be here
66:20 - for six hours right like you guys don't
66:22 - want to be here for six hours straight
66:26 - cool
66:27 - so um all right so let's uh work on that
66:31 - let's add that in
66:33 - so we'll go right here
66:36 - and we'll say
66:38 - we'll go div right there
66:42 - all right and this divs class name let
66:45 - me ask you guys
66:47 - over here this is the login button okay
66:50 - this is what we're calling the login
66:52 - button so what will the class name be
66:56 - what will the class name be
67:00 - login button exactly any of those works
67:04 - all right and we're just going to add
67:05 - the text that says get in
67:07 - that's it
67:09 - let's go get in
67:11 - now let's take a look at it you guys see
67:13 - this button showing up here it says get
67:15 - in
67:17 - yeah
67:17 - okay so right now it's not a it's just a
67:20 - div with some text in it so we'll make
67:22 - it look like a button and and and do
67:24 - things like a button okay so let's go
67:26 - ahead and do that let's go to our
67:28 - header.css again
67:30 - and we're going to get to styling here
67:32 - and i'm going to say dot login button
67:36 - and we'll grab the background
67:39 - and we'll give it a gradient
67:41 - and it's going to be a gradient from
67:42 - left to right
67:44 - and let's give it a
67:47 - greener
67:48 - cyan here
67:51 - 5 9 f9 b7 and then we're going to give
67:54 - it
67:55 - more of a normal cyan at the end so
67:58 - we'll go
67:59 - 6 6 f e a
68:02 - okay so it's going to go from this like
68:03 - greener to cyan so let's go here let's
68:06 - refresh
68:08 - you guys see that you guys see that
68:10 - little gradient popping in there
68:12 - okay another question so why i'm
68:15 - constantly asking you guys these
68:16 - questions i'm trying to engage your
68:18 - brain even if you're not coding
68:21 - if you just keep answering these
68:22 - questions it'll be like you're pretty
68:24 - much coding and the more pattern
68:26 - recognition i can drill into your
68:28 - freaking heads you're going to become
68:30 - better developers because a lot of this
68:31 - is not intelligence it's pattern
68:33 - recognition so a lot of people are
68:36 - answering this aren't because they're
68:37 - solving this they've seen this time and
68:40 - again and they just like remember what
68:42 - needs to be done so
68:44 - remember last time when we needed
68:47 - because these things were so close
68:49 - we needed to give a distance between
68:50 - them right well guess what we need to do
68:52 - that again here because the get is too
68:55 - close to the edges the corners so how do
68:59 - we make this box bigger
69:02 - and make it so there's like more spacing
69:04 - and so the get in is away from the edges
69:07 - whenever i say it's like pushing away
69:09 - from the edges or making it bigger
69:11 - there's one word it starts with the p it
69:13 - should just be coming to your head so
69:15 - freaking fast
69:16 - beautiful up yeah padding padding
69:19 - padding love okay good you love the reps
69:21 - great so just say padding just type it
69:24 - in it will like neuro transmitters will
69:27 - start firing in your brain you'll start
69:28 - making that connection
69:30 - all right so just let's just go here
69:33 - right we'll say padding
69:35 - and we'll give it a certain padding in
69:37 - this case we'll give it like a y-axis
69:39 - padding so 15 pixels
69:41 - and then a x-axis padding okay meaning
69:46 - vertical and horizontal okay so let's go
69:48 - take a look at it again there we go
69:52 - you guys see that
69:54 - all right now with all this padding
69:56 - added all we need to do is make it
69:58 - circular so like let me ask you this
70:00 - whenever you want to round things off
70:02 - this is another pattern that just always
70:04 - keeps coming up whenever you want to
70:05 - round things
70:07 - round things round things right there
70:09 - it's a b word that should be coming to
70:11 - your mind okay every single time
70:14 - b word the initials are br
70:17 - quickly write that in write that in
70:19 - drill it drill it drill it drill it
70:21 - drill it
70:22 - awesome
70:24 - yup great job so border radius if you've
70:27 - said it right that's what actually gives
70:29 - it what you're looking for so let's go
70:31 - ahead and give it that we'll go border
70:33 - radius and we'll go 50 pixels just like
70:36 - this let's go back
70:38 - boom guys
70:39 - is it just me or that looks nice
70:44 - okay what's the only difference between
70:46 - this get in and this get in
70:50 - okay what's the main difference don't
70:51 - worry about the padding difference
70:54 - or don't worry about like the little
70:55 - distance that they have
70:58 - what's the main difference here
71:00 - font color yes yes yes yes yes text is
71:03 - darker good job so we're going to go
71:05 - color
71:06 - and we'll go black
71:08 - okay
71:09 - and
71:10 - that will do it we got get it get in now
71:13 - and it's darker
71:14 - and

76:19 - we're just gonna call it whatever we
76:20 - want it's gonna be a random div okay
76:23 - and we're just gonna store it there but
76:25 - you know maybe let's just write title
76:26 - here for for our sake okay
76:30 - or or let's just call it name
76:32 - all right what else are we going to have
76:36 - we're going to have a number right we're
76:38 - going to have the pricing of it
76:40 - okay so we're going to have definitely
76:42 - something that's going to be
76:44 - related to the price which is going to
76:46 - be you know this is true and stuff but
76:48 - if you look at this this is 37 this is
76:51 - 23
76:52 - so normally it's going to just be the
76:54 - pricing okay so that true is kind of a
76:57 - random one
76:58 - but
76:59 - let's actually go here
77:01 - so this is going to be price
77:04 - okay
77:04 - and then what else is it made up of
77:07 - can you guys see any other images
77:09 - besides this does anybody spot any other
77:12 - images in there
77:14 - good job isaac nice work
77:16 - great work
77:18 - yes so we got our eth image okay so
77:21 - here's another image
77:25 - cool and you guys can probably already
77:27 - start to guess that this image is going
77:29 - to need to be styled a certain way
77:31 - meaning otherwise like it's going to be
77:33 - huge but it's really tiny here so when
77:36 - it's tiny here you can already start to
77:38 - guess that there's going to be some
77:39 - styling going on right
77:41 - this image right here there's gonna be
77:43 - some styling going on here because look
77:45 - the sizes between this and this are
77:47 - different
77:49 - uh there's this border radius here
77:51 - there's some styling going on there so
77:53 - already start to keep these things in
77:54 - mind
77:55 - okay as we go through this
77:57 - cool
77:58 - so let's put an image
78:00 - and for this image here
78:03 - i will
78:04 - let's see what we need to do okay
78:08 - so for the new wallet that i created
78:11 - right
78:13 - can i copy image address and paste it
78:16 - let's see if that works
78:17 - oh cool
78:18 - okay that works
78:20 - let's go to open c
78:22 - and i will take my wallet address
78:26 - and uh let's see if that shows up on
78:29 - openc
78:30 - can i type that in
78:33 - nice
78:34 - so you guys see all the crypto all the
78:36 - nfts that i've made are now showing up
78:38 - on openc and i can actually see what
78:40 - they're showing for so this is public
78:42 - information
78:43 - you know if you guys wanted to go here
78:44 - you could
78:45 - i'll drop the link
78:48 - here for all of you
78:51 - okay
78:54 - i'll drop the link right there so you
78:56 - guys can actually go and see my
78:57 - collection
78:58 - okay uh you guys should favorite some of
79:01 - these whichever one is your favorite
79:02 - favorite it i'd love to see it
79:05 - let's see if somebody's already in here
79:08 - oh man
79:09 - actually i don't think it's gonna show
79:11 - me your guys's favorite it right i don't
79:14 - think it works like that
79:17 - yeah i don't think it works like that
79:18 - never mind i thought it was gonna show
79:20 - me your guys's favorites
79:22 - oh wow we got a one dollar donation
79:24 - thank you so much evan really appreciate
79:26 - it
79:28 - thank you brother much love
79:31 - okay
79:32 - awesome so
79:33 - we got these guys right here
79:35 - that's
79:36 - that's all good
79:39 - okay
79:40 - now let's start so i got that image
79:43 - address
79:44 - right
79:46 - and that's the image we're gonna use at
79:48 - some point okay for now i'm just going
79:49 - to put image right here
79:51 - and this collection card is going to
79:53 - take in a couple of things as props it's
79:56 - going to take in an id it's going to
79:57 - take a name
79:59 - it's going to take in let's say some
80:01 - traits and it's going to take in an
80:03 - image
80:05 - okay
80:06 - we'll go right there and i'll go class
80:09 - name
80:09 - details okay
80:11 - these details will contain some of the
80:13 - details that we're going to pass
80:16 - we're also going to give a name
80:18 - right so remember when we were building
80:21 - it out i showed you guys that there's
80:23 - going to be a name right here
80:25 - right so the class name of this div here
80:27 - is going to be name just like this
80:30 - okay
80:31 - and inside of here it's going to be the
80:33 - name
80:35 - and then next to the name if you guys
80:37 - noticed
80:38 - we have another thing which is the
80:41 - uh the actual id
80:44 - and this id
80:45 - is being you know
80:47 - uh basically they're pulled from here or
80:49 - we're just incrementing it manually
80:51 - ourselves but this id is correlating
80:53 - with each of the punks okay
80:58 - so
80:59 - let's go ahead and make this div
81:02 - this class name of this is going to be
81:04 - id
81:07 - and it's going to have this
81:10 - right here that will actually grab this
81:12 - dot
81:14 - okay i think you can do it with um
81:21 - i don't know the shortcut for it is
81:23 - but you could put a daughter an asterisk
81:26 - i mean either one is fine or you don't
81:27 - even need to put any of that there you
81:29 - could just do it regularly like without
81:31 - it you could just do it like this
81:32 - and like you could remove that that's
81:34 - fine too it'll still look good
81:37 - this dot right here is coming from the
81:39 - fact that we put that dot right there
81:42 - right this
81:43 - hashtag is representing that hashtag
81:45 - right there and this id that we're
81:47 - pulling
81:48 - is representing this id right here okay
81:53 - cool let's go down here now we're going
81:55 - to build out our price container
81:58 - so go class name and i'll go price
82:01 - container
82:05 - and we'll put our images in here
82:08 - so
82:09 - this will be called this will be our
82:11 - ethereum image
82:14 - all right and then the class name here
82:18 - is going to be
82:20 - image like this
82:22 - weak image or eth image either one is
82:24 - fine
82:26 - okay and then we're going to put um
82:30 - our price
82:32 - here
82:33 - okay
82:36 - and i'll show you guys how to get the
82:37 - price kind of dynamically as well okay
82:40 - in just a second
82:43 - but yeah so this is what we have when it
82:44 - comes to the collection card
82:46 - now what we need to do is uh be able to
82:49 - show it okay so here let's let's
82:50 - actually finish this out so let's go
82:52 - traits
82:54 - of zero
82:57 - and uh dot value
83:00 - so i'll show you guys once we pull the
83:02 - data from openc
83:04 - all right we're going to pass it in
83:06 - and we'll have something called traits
83:09 - all right inside of the traits we'll
83:11 - have
83:12 - access to all all of our traits meaning
83:15 - we'll have access to this
83:18 - okay
83:18 - properties is just another word for
83:20 - traits that we're using
83:24 - cool
83:26 - so now this collection card thing that
83:29 - we have
83:30 - let's go ahead and put it on app.js so
83:32 - i'm going to go to app.js here and i'll
83:34 - say collection
83:36 - card
83:37 - and it auto imported for me from there
83:40 - okay and it says weed is not defined and
83:43 - it's just because we have to import it
83:44 - so i'm going to say import
83:46 - weath from
83:49 - assets slash width.png
83:53 - okay beautiful
83:54 - now
83:55 - going back to the collection card we
83:57 - need to give it a couple of props so we
83:59 - have to give it an id and i'll just give
84:01 - it an idea of zero
84:04 - okay we'll give it an idea of zero
84:06 - what else do we need to give it guys so
84:07 - we gave it an id there's four things
84:09 - what else do we need to give it
84:12 - any guesses we gave it an id
84:14 - the next thing is yes
84:16 - name
84:18 - all right so for name
84:20 - i'll just write bandana
84:23 - punk
84:26 - okay let's put it as string
84:30 - what else after name yes good job isaac
84:33 - good job
84:34 - joe good job jehu good job crystal
84:36 - traits
84:37 - so we'll give it traits
84:40 - now traits is going to be the only one
84:42 - that's going to look slightly confusing
84:44 - and we'll have a value
84:47 - of let's say
84:48 - 7 eth
84:51 - okay so
84:52 - it's an array
84:55 - with an object inside of it okay and
84:58 - then the last thing we're going to give
85:00 - it is an image
85:03 - okay so right now the crypto punk image
85:05 - is not showing up so here i'll just go
85:09 - image
85:10 - okay and i'll i'll give it that like
85:12 - crazy link
85:14 - that um
85:19 - that i got earlier for the nft labs one
85:21 - right so i'll just paste that link right
85:24 - there boom there we go
85:26 - so collection card gave it an id gave it
85:28 - a name give it traits give it an image
85:31 - and you can see that it's showing up
85:34 - okay it's not looking the best
85:37 - right
85:38 - here you can actually even see it says
85:40 - bandanna punk
85:42 - right you can see that but it's black
85:44 - right now
85:45 - and then and then you can even see it
85:47 - says um
85:49 - zero just like we wanted it so saying
85:51 - all of the things but
85:53 - is this styled how we want it right it's
85:56 - not
85:57 - probably you would say not even close
86:00 - so now we need to fix this right we need
86:04 - to actually change this
86:08 - so let's go ahead and uh let's style our
86:11 - collection card
86:12 - so now
86:13 - you guys have seen the pattern
86:15 - when we created header that was to add
86:17 - the component but then when we wanted to
86:19 - style it we created header.css
86:22 - we added the functionality of collection
86:24 - uh card now we need to style it so what
86:27 - do what are we going to need to do guys
86:29 - what file do we need to create
86:33 - awesome job samir codes just dropped the
86:35 - donation five dollars thank you so much
86:38 - and he says you're doing awesome thank
86:40 - you for inspiring me to become a web
86:41 - developer beautiful brother happy to
86:43 - hear that that is amazing
86:46 - yes good job collection.css or
86:49 - collectioncard.css
86:51 - exactly we're going to keep the names
86:52 - almost the same here okay so i'll just
86:54 - show you here
86:56 - good job you guys are doing great so
86:58 - let's go collectioncard.css
87:01 - like this
87:04 - okay and in here i'm gonna go collection
87:06 - card
87:08 - and uh we'll go color
87:10 - white
87:14 - okay
87:15 - cool
87:16 - now
87:19 - we do need to import it that's why the
87:21 - styling is not showing up so we're going
87:22 - to go import
87:24 - or not not in app.js i'm sorry let's go
87:26 - back to collection.js here
87:29 - and let's go
87:30 - import right and what am i going to
87:32 - import
87:33 - how am i going to import this
87:36 - what's going to be the line that i write
87:37 - here
87:40 - import what
87:42 - dot slash
87:45 - yes good job collection
87:48 - collectioncard.css okay it's this
87:50 - specific file right here that i'm
87:52 - importing and now do you guys see that
87:54 - that styling is already being applied
87:56 - the text font that i just made white is
87:58 - showing up
88:02 - okay
88:04 - beautiful
88:05 - so
88:06 - let's go background to color on this
88:09 - and we'll give it one a one c one e on
88:12 - this okay so now you should see this
88:16 - grayish background color pop up over
88:18 - here
88:19 - we'll give it a border radius
88:22 - of 20
88:24 - pixels
88:26 - okay
88:27 - so the border radius will start showing
88:29 - up i mean right now it's like super huge
88:31 - so it's like hard to kind of see what's
88:32 - going on but once we start controlling
88:35 - its size like you see the border radius
88:37 - is showing up right there you guys see
88:38 - that
88:39 - right there
88:44 - we gotta tame this beast let's go
88:46 - overflow
88:48 - hidden on this thing let's give it a
88:51 - width of 300 pixels
88:54 - okay there we go starting to get more
88:56 - and more control now right
88:58 - there we go so like the card is
89:01 - is the width-wise is starting to look
89:03 - good now we have to control its height
89:05 - because the height is still too much
89:10 - okay that starts controlling the height
89:12 - a lot more
89:14 - and now we got to give it margin
89:17 - right 30 pixels
89:20 - okay
89:21 - and another thing we got to do is we got
89:23 - to grab the image and we got to make
89:26 - sure it's 100
89:29 - there we go okay
89:32 - so now
89:33 - we're starting to see it we got the
89:35 - border radius
89:37 - right we got this action going on the
89:40 - split
89:42 - the eth image is still huge
89:44 - so we're going to need to do something
89:45 - about that
89:47 - let's actually do something about it
89:49 - right away so let's
89:50 - go uh
89:52 - image
89:53 - and we'll go height give it 23.
89:57 - okay and with we'll give it 50 pixels
90:00 - here
90:01 - oh my goodness girardo thank you so much
90:04 - brother wow gerardo just donated 10
90:09 - thank you gerardo really freaking
90:11 - appreciate it
90:13 - thank you thank you thank you thank you

90:18 - front end mastery boot camp thank you so
90:20 - much for the love gerard i really
90:21 - appreciate it
90:23 - um
90:25 - that's our coding bootcamp that a lot of
90:27 - students go to and we help them become
90:30 - developers in 90 days to 120 days so
90:33 - that's something you're interested in
90:34 - you want to get that result hit us up
90:36 - and let me know
90:38 - okay with that said let's keep rocking
90:39 - and rolling i swear i didn't pay him to
90:42 - pay me to say that
90:45 - he just
90:46 - he did it of his own accord
90:50 - um okay cool so we got the image kind of
90:53 - under control that's what we wanted
90:55 - let's get the pricing to be to look good
90:58 - as well we'll give it some margin left
91:01 - 5 pixels and i'll give it a font weight
91:04 - of 600
91:07 - okay
91:08 - for naught weight font wait
91:10 - there we go
91:13 - okay so now you can see the seven is
91:15 - showing up a lot more clearly right
91:17 - there right
91:18 - cool now let's uh put the price
91:20 - container that we had let's style that
91:24 - we'll do display flex everything shows
91:26 - up in a row
91:28 - yeah just like this boom
91:32 - and then let's go ahead and i'll go
91:34 - align item center on that thing
91:36 - we will go
91:38 - margin
91:40 - top 10 pixels
91:42 - and then we're gonna go object fit
91:44 - contain so everything just looks super
91:46 - crispy
91:47 - okay
91:49 - beautiful
91:52 - now the details portion let's
91:55 - make that look a little bit better too
91:57 - i'll give it a padding of 20 pixels
91:59 - amazing
92:02 - name so we want to make this part here
92:05 - big right like that's the title part
92:08 - that you guys were talking about so
92:09 - let's go
92:10 - and give it a bigger font size
92:12 - and we'll give it a bigger font weight
92:15 - as well that's going to make it like
92:18 - bold and pop out
92:21 - cool
92:23 - now
92:24 - the id we want to give it a different
92:26 - color
92:27 - okay
92:28 - so let's go a1 a5 b0 on this bad boy
92:33 - so that's such a beautiful color
92:34 - actually
92:35 - go font size 18 pixels so slightly
92:38 - smaller on the font size and then let's
92:40 - also make the font weight slightly
92:43 - less as well
92:45 - okay
92:46 - fantastic
92:49 - so with that said i mean the card
92:52 - you know is looking pretty good the only
92:54 - difference right now is it's too close
92:56 - to the edges
92:58 - so let's go ahead and fix that
93:01 - margin left here
93:06 - okay
93:07 - let's see
93:11 - that looks good to me
93:14 - that looks good to me
93:20 - mm-hmm
93:26 - hmm
93:27 - just a little bit closer here okay let's
93:29 - see what's happening so let's go back
93:32 - to our collection card
93:38 - yes price container
93:41 - [Music]
93:50 - oh my details my details are off yeah
93:53 - yeah yeah i'm just opening it and kind
93:55 - of closing it right there that's not
93:57 - right i think uh
93:59 - details need to close
94:04 - a bit actually
94:07 - details needs to close that whole thing
94:12 - there we go
94:14 - uh details closes lower than that right
94:17 - yes perfect thank you david i appreciate
94:20 - you yeah yeah
94:21 - i was just about to head there okay
94:22 - appreciate that awesome so yeah because
94:24 - we added the padding to details right if
94:27 - you see it here we added the padding to
94:29 - details
94:30 - so that's what allowed that to happen
94:33 - and again remember the pattern guys
94:34 - remember what we said when things get
94:36 - too close to each other the pattern is
94:39 - most of the times padding so start
94:42 - remembering that
94:43 - with that said i think now this card is
94:47 - looking awesome i mean how does this
94:49 - card look guys you guys like how this
94:51 - card looks
94:53 - i mean look at this thing
94:56 - you guys i if you've been following this
94:58 - so far right we're almost getting to the
95:01 - end of this app wow we're at 145 people
95:03 - on zoom the retention is crazy you guys
95:06 - are on fire
95:08 - already looking snazzy looks great looks
95:12 - good yes
95:14 - amazing you guys are on fire awesome i
95:17 - mean on even on youtube we're almost at
95:18 - 300 people so great that's awesome and
95:21 - by the way if you're watching us on
95:22 - youtube smash that like button
95:25 - turn that thing blue so this video just
95:27 - keeps going out to more and more people
95:29 - helps out a ton
95:31 - okay so the card looks absolutely
95:33 - fantastic and now what we need to do
95:36 - guys is we need to make a bunch of these
95:38 - cards okay it's not just like
95:42 - the few that we have here we want to be
95:45 - able to essentially like loop through it
95:48 - right and then have a bunch of these
95:50 - cards
95:52 - show up so what we're going to do is
95:53 - we're going to make another component
95:55 - and we're going to call that component
95:59 - could you guess
96:02 - actually before we make this other
96:04 - component
96:05 - all right yes some javascript is coming
96:07 - up exactly get ready for it let's
96:09 - actually start pulling the data i think
96:11 - i'm kind of itching to pull the data
96:14 - from
96:15 - open c and start using it so let's go to
96:18 - our app
96:20 - and let's pull some data and we're going
96:22 - to start using some uh
96:24 - some fancy schmancy stuff here too so
96:27 - get ready
96:30 - i wanna get
96:32 - use state and i wanna get use effect
96:36 - and here's where i get it from you state
96:39 - use effect
96:41 - from react and i'll explain why i'm
96:43 - getting this here's where i'm getting
96:44 - this
96:45 - i want to pull all the data from openc
96:50 - i want to pull all of these from open c
96:54 - and i want to store this
96:57 - in
96:58 - in a variable so i have access to all of
97:01 - this like in an array right and so in
97:03 - order to do that with react i need to
97:05 - use use state
97:06 - and also to pull this data and make a
97:09 - api request i need to use
97:13 - use effect
97:14 - okay
97:17 - so that's why i got those two
97:21 - the other thing we're going to do is
97:22 - we're going to do yarn add axios so just
97:25 - install that or you can do npm install
97:27 - axios i'll write that here if you didn't
97:30 - see that because i might have went
97:31 - through too quick so just you
97:33 - yarn add axios or if you're not as cool
97:37 - do npm
97:39 - install
97:40 - axios
97:43 - okay both
97:44 - both ways will work all right i just
97:46 - like yarn more because it's way better
97:49 - um so yeah cool
97:52 - so now that you have axios installed you
97:55 - can do import axios from axios
98:01 - okay
98:02 - just like this
98:06 - perfect
98:08 - and uh now we're getting ready to make
98:11 - an api call
98:13 - you guys excited gonna make an api call
98:15 - it's gonna get real dynamic lots of
98:18 - javascript action going on here
98:20 - yes alicia's palm she's like yes let's
98:24 - go
98:25 - we're gonna be using async away joe
98:27 - absolutely you're right good job
98:31 - all right here we go so we're going to
98:33 - go and
98:34 - create a bucket of punk list data and
98:37 - then we're going to do set punk list
98:38 - data and start it off with an empty
98:40 - array nice and easy okay everything is
98:42 - nice and easy this variable here we're
98:46 - going to store all of our punks right in
98:49 - there okay
98:51 - now we need to do use effect
98:54 - because we're about to make our api call
98:57 - it's gonna not have any dependencies to
98:59 - put that empty bracket there
99:03 - uh and here's what we're gonna do
99:05 - oh this is nice david
99:08 - it's uh auto writing some nice code for
99:10 - me that i bet works
99:12 - okay here's what we're going to do we're
99:14 - going to do
99:15 - get my nfts i'm going to make a function
99:18 - this is going to be an async
99:24 - function all right
99:27 - and we'll do a wait and get the data
99:29 - from axios
99:38 - yeah oh yeah rom that that github
99:42 - autopilot is just too freaking strong
99:46 - now this is where you're gonna get gets
99:47 - uh slightly tricky so follow along with
99:50 - me as i write this out okay so we're
99:52 - going to do https
99:54 - colon slash
99:56 - uh can we drop this link somewhere david
99:59 - so people could get this link
100:01 - i think could be helpful just the base
100:03 - link
100:04 - openc dot io slash
100:06 - assets and then we will do asset
100:11 - contract
100:14 - oh sorry asset contract underscore
100:16 - address equals
100:18 - and this address is basically going to
100:20 - be my third web wallet
100:23 - so i'm going to copy this
100:28 - and i will paste it right there
100:32 - okay
100:32 - and we will do
100:34 - order underscore direction is equal to
100:37 - ascending
100:38 - okay so this should get me all of mine
100:40 - in ascending order
100:41 - okay
100:42 - and then the last thing i want to do
100:44 - here is just do console.log openc
100:47 - data.data.assets
100:50 - all right cool
100:52 - now it will crash for me in just a
100:55 - second
100:56 - i'll
100:58 - i'll avoid the crash
101:06 - okay here we go
101:11 - let's hit inspect
101:13 - said console
101:20 - console.log
101:27 - okay refresh
101:34 - oh wait axios oh i'm not returning this
101:37 - function yes so let's let's call the
101:40 - function actually because i never called
101:41 - it
101:42 - so return get my nfts let's hit refresh
101:47 - so inspect
101:49 - there we go
101:50 - so you can see i get an array
101:59 - huh this array is empty interesting
102:05 - refresh
102:07 - okay i'm probably putting in my
102:11 - test nets
102:13 - dash
102:18 - assets
102:20 - assets question mark asset contract
102:22 - address
102:30 - am i putting in the wrong address i
102:31 - don't think so
102:33 - you're putting in
102:36 - the
102:37 - wait which which link is that
102:39 - this right here i'm grabbing my wall no
102:42 - not that no no it's the uh collection ah
102:44 - yes yes yes okay nice thank you so my
102:47 - bad guys sorry so this is the collection
102:49 - you gotta copy this not the wallet okay
102:52 - this is the collection you gotta get
102:54 - not this
102:57 - copy
103:00 - um
103:01 - double click paste
103:06 - okay there we go now i got access to all
103:09 - six of my
103:12 - little beautiful nfts
103:15 - okay if you actually look through here
103:19 - i'll try to zoom in
103:22 - you'll be able to see you know image
103:24 - thumbnail url
103:26 - you can see things like uh who the owner
103:28 - is
103:29 - and uh you could see traits right traits
103:32 - has a price
103:34 - and you can see value 13
103:37 - representing 13 eth for example
103:40 - okay
103:41 - so
103:43 - let's go back up so it looks like i'm
103:46 - actually getting access to my data now i
103:48 - just need to store this
103:52 - and thank you
103:55 - right there okay so that that line that
103:57 - i just wrote thanks to copilot
104:01 - i'm basically saying set punchless data
104:03 - to whatever data that i got back okay so
104:05 - i'm just storing that in here
104:09 - cool
104:13 - now that i have all the information
104:15 - about every single punk
104:19 - i can actually start to pass it around
104:21 - let me go to my collection card
104:23 - and why is this showing up here that's
104:25 - interesting
104:28 - no idea
104:29 - i don't know how that got there okay
104:33 - so
104:34 - i'm getting access to all my data now
104:37 - we'll actually create our
104:39 - other component guys so what's this
104:41 - component called the component that
104:44 - contains all the collection cards what
104:46 - are we going to call that component you

106:02 - appreciate it
106:03 - all right
106:05 - so
106:07 - now we're gonna build the what guys
106:09 - that's sorry i got distracted we are
106:12 - going to do
106:13 - our freaking
106:15 - um
106:16 - punk list okay there we go goo gan good
106:20 - job we're gonna create our
106:22 - punk
106:23 - punk
106:24 - list all right so
106:28 - i want to start off
106:30 - it's a component right so where am i
106:32 - going to put this
106:33 - which folder am i going to create this
106:35 - file in and what's the file going to be
106:38 - called can you guys guess
106:40 - it's going to be in the components
106:41 - folder
106:42 - and it's going to be called
106:44 - punklist.js
106:47 - i'm going to rf rfce this bad boy hit
106:51 - tab
106:52 - watch the magic happen
106:58 - okay
106:59 - perfect
107:00 - now here's what i need to do in here i
107:03 - know a couple of things about punk list
107:04 - it's going to get access to the punk
107:06 - list data and i know that well for now
107:10 - we'll just leave this as is like this
107:13 - okay
107:14 - and it's going to return
107:17 - class name what's the class name going
107:18 - to be can you guys guess for the punk
107:20 - list component can you guess the class
107:22 - name
107:25 - yes it's going to be punk list
107:28 - all right
107:29 - now inside of here
107:31 - we're going to map through this
107:34 - okay
107:36 - and we don't need access to the index
107:41 - and for each punk i'm gonna do the
107:45 - following
107:47 - my dog is going crazy my english bulldog
107:51 - i'm going to make a div
107:54 - okay
107:56 - and i'm going to leave it empty for now
107:58 - and inside of this div
108:00 - we're going to do our collection card
108:02 - component so remember we're literally
108:04 - looping through and co and creating the
108:07 - collection card over and over again
108:09 - uh does that make sense or did i lose
108:11 - you guys there
108:12 - because punk list is going to be this
108:14 - big thing
108:15 - and all it's going to do is just going
108:16 - to loop through and build this
108:18 - collection card component then build
108:19 - this collection card component and build
108:21 - this collection card component and each
108:23 - time it's going to get like the specific
108:26 - information it needs to build that
108:27 - collection card component
108:30 - okay so that's what's happening
108:36 - collection card
108:38 - okay
108:39 - self-closing tag it's gonna have a
108:41 - couple of things that it's gonna take
108:43 - so we're gonna give it a key and it's
108:45 - going to take the punk token id
108:48 - we're going to give it a punk token id
108:51 - for its id as well for name we're going
108:54 - to give it punk dot name
108:56 - for traits okay can you guess the
108:58 - patterns what am i going to write here
109:00 - it's going to be what
109:02 - punk
109:03 - dot what
109:05 - dot traits
109:08 - okay
109:10 - for the image what is it going to be if
109:12 - you can even guess close you're good for
109:15 - image what am i gonna write
109:16 - if you can look at this pattern punk dot
109:18 - something punk dot something pong dot
109:20 - name punk dot traits it's gonna be what
109:23 - yes very yeah good job everybody who
109:26 - says something with punk dot image
109:27 - you're on the right track okay so it's
109:29 - just going to be punk
109:30 - dot image
109:32 - underscore original
109:34 - underscore url and where this is coming
109:36 - from if you're like what the heck i just
109:38 - thought it's going to be image
109:39 - um it's okay you're not supposed you
109:41 - don't have information of this just yet
109:43 - but it's coming from here
109:46 - uh image
109:48 - underscore original underscore url
109:50 - okay so i have to follow that pattern
109:52 - there
109:56 - okay beautiful
109:58 - so we're we're good on this
110:01 - so all that's happening is once we get
110:03 - all of our data from open c
110:05 - we put it in this variable punk list
110:07 - data our pink list component gets to
110:10 - work loops over
110:13 - and for every single punk um inside of
110:16 - the punchless data
110:18 - it builds it using collection cards
110:22 - using the collection card component so
110:24 - let's see it in action let's go to punk
110:26 - uh let's go to app dot blah blah blah
110:30 - and let's go punk
110:32 - list
110:33 - all right and give it punk list data
110:36 - and let's see if it builds it out whoa
110:39 - it worked on the first try baby let's go
110:43 - uh very rare that that happens but i'm
110:45 - really happy that it worked on the first
110:46 - try because there's a lot of coding that
110:49 - we did there
110:52 - yeah so you guys see how that's
110:53 - happening right super freaking cool we
110:55 - took it from the console
110:57 - yeah where's the blowhorn seriously
111:00 - [Music]
111:01 - i mean
111:02 - literally every freaking thing except
111:04 - for the blowhorn i'm sorry guys
111:07 - [Music]
111:09 - i guess you're just gonna have to live
111:11 - with the with that one that's the best
111:14 - that's the best one we got
111:17 - sounds like nasa
111:23 - in honor of
111:25 - oh man

111:31 - [Music]
111:32 - okay cool
111:34 - yeah
111:36 - seriously
111:37 - okay so now we don't need this
111:39 - hard-coded data right good call whoever
111:41 - said that we don't need that hard-coded
111:43 - data i removed it
111:46 - now a couple of things quick question
111:48 - it's showing up in a column hmm
111:52 - if only there was a way to put it all in
111:55 - a row
111:57 - how do we do that guys
112:01 - yes sir
112:03 - oh and man
112:05 - okay y'all got it good job that's
112:07 - exactly right we're gonna have to
112:10 - flex this thing okay
112:12 - now another question
112:14 - we're gonna need to style right the punk
112:17 - list component i wonder how are we gonna
112:20 - start styling it are we just gonna go in
112:22 - this js file and start styling it right
112:24 - here just boom like right right here in
112:27 - the face is this what we're gonna be
112:28 - doing right now what are we gonna be
112:30 - doing guys
112:32 - yes if you guys got the pattern it's
112:34 - gonna be a css file and it's gonna be in
112:37 - here and it's gonna be called what
112:40 - punk list dot css
112:46 - good job guys you got it nice work
112:52 - man cough needs to just go away
112:56 - here we go so let's get to work boys and
112:59 - girls
113:00 - punk list
113:02 - okay
113:02 - first of all we're gonna make the
113:04 - cursor's pointer now let's go back to
113:06 - punk list the styling is not working
113:08 - styling is not working the cursor is not
113:11 - turning into a pointer causing
113:13 - what's wrong why is this not working
113:17 - what do we need to do
113:19 - why is my cursor not turning into a
113:20 - pointer
113:22 - yes
113:23 - good job
113:26 - we need to import it import
113:29 - punk list dot css
113:31 - okay now i hover over and look at that
113:34 - it turns into a mouse clicky pointer
113:37 - thing
113:38 - beautiful so our styling style file is
113:41 - connected now let's do display flex and
113:43 - let's see if it works
113:45 - oh
113:46 - it didn't work oh it worked
113:49 - whoa guys isn't that nice
113:51 - isn't that pretty freaking sick looks
113:54 - super cool right i know what you're
113:56 - gonna say it's looking a little goofy
113:58 - right now with it's with it going over
114:00 - like that
114:01 - but it looks pretty good
114:03 - other than that
114:05 - um
114:06 - quick question
114:08 - whenever you see things that are
114:10 - overflowing like this and bleeding out
114:12 - of the page bleeding out of the page and
114:15 - overflowing
114:17 - what's the pattern you're thinking about
114:19 - what's the pattern you're thinking about
114:23 - overflowing
114:25 - out of the page
114:28 - yes
114:29 - good job good job
114:33 - okay so we're gonna make overflow scroll
114:37 - up scroll
114:40 - so this is going to make it so like we
114:41 - can actually scroll through it all right
114:44 - so you could do overflow like sometimes
114:46 - overflow hidden can work in this case
114:48 - overflow scroll is gonna work okay
114:50 - because you just put in a scroll box now
114:53 - the whole screen doesn't scroll along
114:55 - with it does that make sense
114:56 - okay cool
114:58 - um
114:59 - let's make it so the scroll bar does not
115:02 - show up so let's see if we can do that
115:06 - let's go web
115:07 - kit scroll bar
115:10 - and we'll go display
115:12 - none
115:15 - nope that bar still is showing up it
115:17 - just gets and got even a little bit
115:19 - uglier interesting
115:20 - we'll see if we can do something about
115:22 - that
115:23 - oh wait why are there so many of those

119:55 - of the styling and and try to explain as
119:57 - i go along

120:05 - this whole thing right here
120:08 - yeah you got this whole thing right
120:10 - there
120:11 - and then inside of it you got the main
120:13 - content
120:14 - okay so this is going to be the content
120:16 - that's inside of it
120:18 - then you have the punk highlight

120:35 - punk highlight we also will have punk
120:37 - highlight
120:38 - we'll also have the punk
120:40 - container
120:41 - it's going to contain it all
120:44 - okay we're going to have the very
120:45 - specific selected punk
120:49 - because there's tons of information
120:50 - about this punk right so this punk
120:52 - container can can be like a big one
120:55 - because it needs to contain
120:57 - the name

121:00 - the address who the owner is a bunch of
121:02 - stuff like that
121:04 - right
121:05 - and then
121:07 - on the right hand side we'll have a
121:09 - couple of other things right like for
121:11 - example we got
121:13 - we got all of this stuff right here
121:16 - at the owner link to instagram twitter
121:20 - more
121:21 - so there's a bunch of stuff going on in
121:23 - here okay i'll try to go through it but
121:25 - we'll go through this a little bit
121:26 - faster
121:29 - all right so class name for the whole
121:31 - thing is gonna be main
121:34 - all right inside of here we're going to
121:35 - have a class name this is going to
121:37 - contain the main content that's kind of
121:39 - what we want
121:42 - okay
121:42 - in here we'll have a class name of
121:46 - punk highlight
121:49 - and then in here we're gonna have class
121:52 - name
121:53 - of punk container
121:55 - okay
121:56 - inside of punk container we'll have an
121:58 - image
122:00 - okay this image will be the active punk
122:04 - that is selected
122:06 - original url
122:11 - okay
122:14 - like this
122:15 - okay
122:16 - activepunk and then we will also put a
122:20 - class name here because we want to style
122:22 - this later and we'll call this
122:24 - selected punk
122:28 - okay cool
122:29 - so so far
122:31 - so good
122:32 - okay
122:36 - yep we got our punk container right here
122:40 - all right
122:47 - right outside of this we're gonna have
122:48 - our punk uh details all right so
122:55 - so right outside of our entire punk
122:57 - highlight
122:58 - we're going to have punk detail so we're
123:00 - going to go like this
123:02 - and we're going to say class name and
123:03 - we're going to go punk details
123:07 - okay
123:07 - and we'll do some in-line styling here
123:10 - as well just so you guys can see how to
123:12 - do it
123:13 - but we're gonna just give it a color
123:15 - text color of white
123:18 - okay inside of the punk details
123:21 - we want to have a class name we're gonna
123:23 - call it title this is gonna be
123:26 - essentially that big huge
123:29 - you know bold right in your face name
123:34 - oh wow

123:45 - nice thank you so much for the 10
123:47 - donation and it seems like
123:49 - this person just graduated from our

123:53 - amazing happy super happy to hear that
123:58 - okay cool
124:00 - class name
124:01 - title right and then inside of here
124:04 - we're going to put our active punk
124:06 - active punk's
124:08 - name okay
124:11 - okay we're gonna put a span tag next to
124:14 - this
124:15 - and we'll give it item number
124:22 - okay and you know while we're doing this
124:26 - let's make it so we can also kind of see
124:27 - what we're doing so it's not just
124:29 - completely like all blind so i'll just
124:31 - go main
124:34 - all right and uh let's import it as well
124:36 - so i'll remove the n and import
124:40 - okay let's uh let's go let's go
124:45 - here and refresh
124:53 - yep let's go back to main
124:57 - so instead of active punk we'll just
124:58 - kind of hard code these names for now so
125:01 - i'll just say bandana
125:03 - bandana
125:05 - punk
125:07 - all right i will grab this guy here as
125:09 - well
125:10 - and uh for this image url
125:14 - we'll just um
125:16 - do our own image right this one right
125:18 - here we'll put it as a string
125:24 - amazing there we go
125:25 - okay
125:27 - so now
125:28 - this main is at least starting to show
125:30 - up right you guys can see the main
125:33 - um it's huge
125:35 - right but it's it's there so let's work
125:38 - on it visually so we can see what we're
125:40 - doing as we go
125:44 - cool so punk details
125:47 - we got the title
125:50 - yeah
125:53 - and then class name item number we're
125:55 - gonna put that little uh dot thing again
126:01 - okay and uh i'll just put a token id so
126:04 - i'll just say three here
126:06 - okay all of this stuff we're going to be
126:08 - changing with dynamic data afterwards
126:10 - okay
126:12 - outside of here
126:15 - let's go ahead and do div
126:17 - class name
126:19 - owner details
126:20 - and guys we're almost coming to an end
126:23 - okay but the last functionality that you
126:25 - want to stick around for this is the
126:26 - honestly the most important one is when
126:28 - you click and
126:30 - you know when you select this that one
126:33 - shows up so that one we're almost
126:35 - getting there okay we're almost there
126:40 - owner details
126:46 - item number yes that's absolutely right
126:49 - so underneath item number we're gonna
126:51 - have owner
126:54 - and inside of our
126:56 - owner we're gonna have
126:59 - owner image container
127:01 - because now we need to start putting
127:03 - owner information
127:04 - and we're gonna have an image for our
127:06 - owner
127:08 - okay and for now we're just gonna put
127:12 - this same image
127:14 - okay just for now
127:17 - owner image container
127:20 - and then outside of this
127:30 - so this is our owner image container
127:35 - yep outside of this we want to put owner
127:37 - details some other owner details so
127:39 - let's go here and we'll go class name
127:43 - owner details
127:47 - okay inside of here
127:49 - i want to go
127:50 - owner name and handle
127:53 - so just to kind of visually show you
127:55 - what we're working on right now is
127:58 - you know owner name and handle and
128:00 - that's where that will go
128:02 - uh owner image will go right there
128:06 - yeah and then we need to put some other
128:08 - details like the owner's wallet address
128:11 - and then we're gonna put these
128:13 - okay and then we're we're done with the
128:15 - all the owner stuff
128:17 - but it's all gonna be under this owner
128:19 - div
128:20 - okay
128:23 - owner name and handle so inside of owner
128:25 - name and handle we're gonna have a div
128:27 - right here
128:29 - and uh this is gonna be the owner
128:31 - address so we'll just put this address
128:34 - right here
128:42 - okay
128:43 - right underneath this will go div
128:47 - and this will have the class name of
128:50 - owner
128:52 - handle
128:53 - i will do at clever programmer
129:01 - okay
129:04 - yeah so this is showing the owner's
129:06 - stuff
129:07 - and all that stuff is starting to show
129:09 - up except you guys know why it's not
129:11 - showing up like we can't read it easily
129:14 - right can you guess why this is
129:16 - happening
129:22 - yep
129:24 - exactly font color so we're going to
129:26 - handle that font color as well once we
129:28 - get to the styling part okay and then we
129:30 - just have one last part that's left and
129:34 - then we're just gonna do that part and
129:36 - um
129:37 - it's a bunch of some of it this code is
129:39 - kind of repeating so i'll do this a
129:41 - little bit faster
129:44 - so right underneath the owner handle
129:47 - right it's just some repeating code
129:49 - right here all right so we got
129:52 - um
129:53 - instagram logo twitter logo and then a
129:56 - more icon right so there's just these
129:58 - three repeating and we just pop that in
130:01 - right there now i got this error
130:03 - instagram logo twitter logo and more
130:05 - icon is not defined
130:06 - but that's just because we need to
130:08 - import these images
130:11 - so we're just going to go ahead and do
130:13 - that now
130:14 - okay
130:16 - these images we have access to from our
130:19 - assets
130:21 - okay
130:22 - our assets folder has access to all of
130:24 - these images owner images right here
130:28 - and we're just pulling them out and
130:29 - we're just popping them in right there
130:34 - okay so now boom
130:36 - right this is showing up
130:38 - great
130:40 - now what we need to do is uh we just
130:43 - need to style all this so when i'm
130:45 - thinking styling for main component what
130:48 - am i going to be doing guys what's the
130:49 - pattern here that you're seeing i need
130:51 - to style so what's my next step without
130:54 - even thinking you should be able to get
130:55 - to this
130:59 - yes absolute somebody said flex no you
131:02 - need to create a file so we're going to
131:04 - create a file it's going to be called
131:06 - main.css okay good job so now in
131:08 - main.css we're going to do a bunch of
131:10 - styling so i'm going to grab main and
131:12 - i'll say max height
131:14 - set it to 50
131:16 - uh vh okay so let's refresh
131:19 - cool
131:20 - okay so we we just kind of made sure
131:22 - that the height is uh there's a certain
131:24 - max of the height it doesn't go
131:26 - more or less than that okay but now
131:29 - it's not showing up so what do we need
131:32 - to do okay i just added some styling but
131:34 - it didn't do anything
131:36 - whenever that happens what do i need to
131:38 - do
131:39 - good job isaac good job
131:42 - lucero good job aaron good job everybody
131:45 - refresh that's another one good job but
131:47 - in this case walter good job this is
131:49 - going to be import so we're going to
131:50 - import
131:53 - main.css
131:54 - okay
131:55 - so there you go
131:58 - right there's something happening even
132:00 - though it's not looking right yet but
132:02 - there's something happening so that's a
132:04 - good sign
132:05 - now we're going to go main content we're
132:07 - going to go display
132:09 - flex
132:11 - go padding
132:12 - bottom
132:15 - 20 pixels on this we'll go border bottom
132:19 - one pixel solid and make it white
132:22 - like this
132:24 - okay
132:25 - so
132:27 - um
132:29 - now we have this
132:31 - these some of these huge images
132:33 - right but it's they're showing up at the
132:36 - very least and their styling that we're
132:38 - doing is actually doing what it needs to
132:40 - do
132:41 - let's go punk highlight
132:43 - and we're going to make the flex on this
132:45 - thing 0.25
132:48 - i'm going to make sure it's display flex
132:51 - and we'll center align everything and we
132:54 - will
132:55 - also
132:57 - horizontally align everything okay let's
133:00 - refresh
133:01 - cool
133:02 - so now things are starting to get a
133:03 - little bit more contained they're still
133:05 - weird but they're starting to get a
133:07 - little bit more contained
133:08 - okay now let's
133:10 - go to the punk container
133:13 - and put a border radius on it of 20
133:16 - pixels
133:18 - we'll do overflow
133:21 - hidden
133:23 - okay
133:24 - so the screen like right now the screen
133:26 - still kind of goes to the side so we'll
133:28 - try to control this too in a second
133:33 - let's enable display flex on this
133:36 - okay and then we'll give a margin right
133:38 - of 20 pixels
133:41 - okay
133:43 - all right um we will need to style
133:45 - selected punk as well soon enough but
133:48 - that's after we add in our
133:51 - punk functionality
133:53 - punk details
133:55 - display flex
133:59 - okay
134:07 - okay
134:10 - all right
134:13 - we'll go flex direction on this thing
134:15 - and i'll go column
134:18 - all right we'll justify content we'll go
134:20 - space between on this
134:23 - and flex will go 0.75
134:26 - okay
134:30 - all right
134:31 - um
134:32 - let's just double check
134:33 - what is happening and why is this is uh
134:37 - this is looking
134:39 - like this for too long i'll try killing
134:40 - this and yarn starting it again
134:45 - david can you double check this and see
134:48 - um
134:49 - there's something going on with this
134:53 - okay let's just go back here i just want
134:55 - to make sure everything is looking good
134:57 - structurally okay
135:01 - you can have one div off and the whole
135:03 - thing will be thrown off like crazy
135:13 - closing here
135:15 - that closes that closes this closes okay
135:18 - so that's good
135:20 - corner details looks good
135:26 - okay we have the main
135:28 - main contains everything
135:41 - yeah
135:43 - it's uh getting a little bit wild
135:50 - are you in here
135:54 - david
135:56 - oh
135:57 - okay i was just checking if you if
135:59 - you're in here or not
136:01 - um i don't see your cursor anywhere
136:05 - i actually click this following ah okay
136:08 - i can see you now
136:10 - cool
136:12 - okay so while we figure out the styling
136:15 - uh let's go here
136:19 - i'll try to simplify it in a second if
136:21 - we don't fix this bug but i'm just going
136:24 - to check the structure and see if it's
136:25 - sound
136:27 - okay that looks good
136:29 - we have the image
136:30 - that's fine
136:35 - yep
136:36 - yeah that looks good
136:39 - we have the punk details
136:53 - yeah
136:55 - punk owner
136:58 - huh that all looks good
137:02 - it all looks good
137:14 - hmm
137:38 - okay so something magically
137:42 - worked okay so let's see what are the
137:45 - things that actually made that happen
137:49 - because it is kind of all over the place
137:53 - uh david is it a selected punk one that
137:55 - i didn't add oh yeah i didn't add that
137:58 - one yeah you have the class name
137:59 - selected punk
138:02 - yeah
138:03 - that's the one i think we needed to add
138:05 - okay
138:07 - uh you can talk to right david or you're
138:09 - on mute
138:21 - hello nice okay okay
138:24 - um i'm hearing feedback
138:28 - oh no
138:28 - now it's good now it's good
138:30 - okay awesome
138:32 - so uh
138:33 - is it the selected punk one because uh
138:36 - that should be good i just i dropped
138:38 - that in and
138:40 - after that you said oh it's good
138:42 - okay um i'll try to okay so
138:45 - let's
138:46 - i'm gonna kind of get past this guys a
138:48 - little bit so i am cheating here
138:51 - because i just want to make sure that
138:53 - this gets done and then we have the
138:54 - select uh functionality working so even
138:57 - if we have some bugs left we'll try to
138:59 - finish them out before this thing ends
139:02 - but i want to kind of move on because i
139:04 - think styling is an important part but
139:06 - it's not the most important part of the
139:08 - app
139:09 - um we'll get more to the styling let's
139:12 - work on the functionality let's get the
139:13 - selected punk uh working
139:16 - and then we'll fix the styling so maybe
139:18 - david if you want to like uh see if you
139:20 - can fix these here right like
139:23 - the styling move it down and i can
139:25 - explain it at the end do you want to
139:26 - work on that for a little bit
139:28 - okay so you try to kind of work on that
139:30 - and um
139:32 - i'll i'll i'll get the select
139:34 - functionality working
139:36 - okay so what you guys missed here is i
139:39 - you and you guys can screenshot this or
139:41 - go through the video but i just kind of
139:43 - put the finished version of the styling
139:46 - okay so there's a bunch of things here
139:48 - that i added like for example title
139:51 - to give it a title size
139:53 - okay and
139:54 - item number
139:56 - styling for the owner the styling for
139:58 - each div the owner image container
140:01 - because like all of these we're just
140:02 - going to take a ton of time
140:04 - and
140:05 - all of these styling i'm going to make
140:06 - it available for you guys so you guys
140:08 - can kind of go through it at your own
140:09 - pace and you should be fine
140:12 - okay
140:14 - the only one that's bugging me is like
140:16 - the size of this bandana punk like that
140:19 - that should be easy to make it huge so
140:23 - because we have title
140:25 - class name title
140:30 - and then we have title right here and we
140:32 - are clearly giving it this huge size
140:39 - oh
140:40 - class name with the capital n is that
140:42 - what it is
140:44 - yes
140:46 - nailed it
140:48 - okay there's probably some other like
140:51 - typo that i've made
140:53 - it's causing it to
140:55 - do some funny things but um
140:58 - ah there we go so a lot of it is pretty
141:01 - much good to go there's just probably a
141:02 - couple of other things left but
141:04 - this looks good enough for now and now i
141:06 - want to move on to the functionality of
141:07 - when you select it actually puts that
141:10 - one right there okay
141:13 - cool so let's get to it
141:17 - yeah nice we're coming close to the end
141:20 - guys so this is gonna be the finale okay
141:24 - all right so let's work on the selected
141:26 - functionality so here's what we need to
141:28 - do when somebody clicks this i need to
141:32 - recognize that that's been clicked okay
141:34 - so let's go into
141:36 - punk list
141:37 - and in punk list what i'm going to do is
141:40 - i want to add an on click
141:42 - on the on the card
141:44 - all right so let's go here and let's go
141:46 - on click
141:47 - and i want you to do the following
141:49 - for now just console log punk.token id
141:54 - all right so when i click this
141:56 - show me the id of this and so it should
141:58 - show me zero for bandana punk one for
142:01 - cyberpunk two for cigar hat punk
142:04 - let's hit inspect
142:06 - it's at console
142:09 - class name did you mean class name
142:12 - um
142:14 - okay
142:18 - david is there another place we have
142:20 - class name lowercase somewhere
142:24 - because i think that's kind of what it's
142:25 - telling me
142:27 - okay let's look it up
142:30 - all right so i'm gonna click one of
142:32 - these guys click
142:34 - so it says one right when i click this
142:36 - one you guys see how it says two at the
142:38 - bottom right there
142:39 - click another one
142:40 - okay i'll see if i can zoom in on this
142:42 - so you guys can see it better boom click
142:45 - this one three click this one four
142:47 - click this one five click this one so
142:49 - i'm able to actually get the id
142:52 - on click and on my clicks were being
142:54 - detected
142:56 - here's what i'm gonna do now
142:58 - now we're gonna get it make it a little
142:59 - bit fancier so i'm gonna go to my app
143:02 - and i'll create
143:05 - a state variable for which is the
143:07 - selected punk
143:10 - okay
143:11 - so we're gonna do uh selected punk and
143:13 - we're gonna do set selected punk
143:15 - and uh and by default i'm just gonna
143:17 - have it be zero
143:19 - okay
143:20 - this selected punk hook i'm actually
143:23 - gonna pass it
143:28 - i think i should be able to pass it like
143:30 - this too right does that work
143:34 - maybe not
143:36 - yeah or maybe that works set selected
143:38 - punk
143:39 - okay we'll give it a try if it doesn't
143:41 - work then then we'll fix it
143:43 - let's go to punk list and i'm going to
143:45 - pass set selected
143:47 - punk
143:48 - like this
143:49 - and then i'm going to change the
143:51 - selected punk through this i'm going to
143:53 - say set selected punk like that
143:55 - okay
143:58 - and
143:59 - i believe this should okay just to be
144:01 - safe i'll leave this here like this i
144:03 - can always check my theory later
144:06 - i think that should work but yeah let's
144:07 - just leave this like this uh oh wait
144:10 - sorry set selected punk
144:12 - like that all right
144:15 - so now what should happen is when i
144:17 - click
144:19 - uh this variable selected punk
144:21 - should get updated with which is the
144:23 - which
144:24 - with whichever is the currently active
144:27 - selected punk or like the most recent
144:29 - one that i just clicked
144:33 - um how do i switch between files so fast
144:36 - i have a shortcut so for you guys it
144:38 - should be like command
144:41 - p or something i think
144:42 - yep command p yeah command p and if you
144:45 - do command pp it'll switch to the most
144:48 - recent file if you do command p and then
144:50 - like type in so for example
144:53 - you know if you type in the name of the
144:54 - file like it'll take you there
144:57 - right so i'll just do i change that to
144:59 - command d because i think command d is a
145:01 - much better shortcut way better than
145:03 - command p but just just do command p
145:06 - and then if you do command pp it'll take
145:08 - you the most recent file
145:10 - and if you do command p
145:12 - and then just type start type like don't
145:14 - even look and think about it just like
145:16 - whatever file you want to go to may not
145:18 - just type it in hit enter and
145:20 - boom it'll take you there so really fast
145:22 - way to navigate around
145:25 - command pp yeah go to the bathroom
145:27 - that's funny
145:28 - [Music]
145:30 - okay cool so i got this
145:33 - so far so that's good so selected punk
145:35 - that's
145:36 - awesome now what we need to do
145:39 - is when i do select the punk i need this
145:43 - image
145:44 - and this whole thing to update
145:48 - yeah
145:49 - so let's go ahead and work on that okay
145:53 - so punk list
145:56 - pass it
146:04 - all right so in maine what i want to do
146:06 - is let's go to main
146:08 - and in maine i want to do the following
146:11 - i want to basically say
146:13 - const active
146:16 - punk
146:17 - set active
146:19 - punk
146:20 - and we'll just say use state
146:24 - and the from punk list data
146:26 - grab the first um
146:29 - punk okay
146:30 - and uh we'll also pass some props so
146:33 - we'll pass it selected punk and we'll
146:35 - pass it punk list
146:37 - data
146:39 - so this will be all of the punks this is
146:41 - the currently selected punk that will
146:43 - pass it
146:46 - all right now it doesn't know use state
146:48 - so we're going to import you state like
146:49 - david is helping us super nicely thank
146:52 - you
146:52 - all right so we're going to
146:54 - import your state
146:56 - and then we'll also need use effect so
146:58 - david if you could also import use
147:00 - effect that'll be really nice and we'll
147:03 - go and we'll do this
147:07 - set activepunk to
147:11 - punk list
147:12 - data
147:14 - and then in here i'm going to say
147:15 - selected punk just like this
147:18 - and for the dependency array here all i
147:21 - need is punk list data
147:24 - and then selected punk
147:26 - okay
147:27 - this means that the page will update if
147:30 - the punk list changes or the selected
147:32 - punch changes because that's what you
147:33 - want right you don't want to hit refresh
147:35 - every single time to see the change you
147:37 - want to see it in real time
147:40 - okay
147:42 - um punk list data
147:45 - [Music]
147:47 - yep so it's getting an error on this
147:50 - line
147:51 - it's having problems reading this okay
147:53 - because we're not passing it to main so
147:55 - i'm going to go right here
147:56 - and i need to pass punk list data to
147:59 - main so we'll say punk list data
148:01 - is equal to
148:05 - punk list
148:07 - data just like that
148:11 - oh nice look at that
148:13 - did that work actually
148:16 - oh yes it did work but it's not active
148:18 - yet like it's not um
148:20 - this is not dynamic yet because it's
148:22 - just like pulling dummy data so now we
148:25 - need to actually give it
148:27 - actual data
148:28 - right so what i need to do here
148:32 - is this source here now
148:35 - what we're going to do is we're going to
148:36 - change it and this just turns into
148:37 - activepunk.image.url
148:41 - okay
148:42 - cannot read properties of undefined
148:46 - okay
148:47 - punk list data we're passing it in
148:50 - we're grabbing the xeros guy
148:54 - that's what the active punk then becomes
148:58 - should be good
149:02 - okay
149:04 - main
149:07 - punchless data
149:12 - pass it
149:14 - punchless data
149:20 - mm-hmm
149:22 - receive punchless data grab the zeroth
149:25 - element inside of it
149:36 - hmm
149:49 - cannot read properties of undefined
149:57 - well it should be defined okay so let's
150:00 - just um
150:01 - let's comment this out for a second
150:07 - what the heck
150:09 - where'd everything go
150:11 - uh this is when
150:13 - wait you're doing the api call already
150:15 - right yeah so this is when you want to
150:18 - check for if
150:20 - if the api call has gone through already
150:24 - you know the puncture is data length
150:25 - more than zero oh okay okay yeah that's
150:28 - the js okay cool so in here uh that's
150:31 - actually a good catch so what we want to
150:33 - do is we don't even want to call these
150:35 - unless the api call has gone through so
150:38 - the little hack that we can actually do
150:40 - for this is we can actually go punk
150:41 - listdata.length
150:44 - and if that's greater than zero then and
150:47 - only then pass this because yeah right
150:49 - now it's being called without the api
150:52 - call even happening
150:54 - so we're gonna pop that in here close
150:56 - off with parentheses
150:58 - and uh
151:00 - yeah okay
151:07 - and this is going to be in a gss
151:09 - fragment
151:22 - wait what are you doing david doing
151:23 - something
151:28 - yeah perfect thank you
151:31 - so all we did here guys is
151:34 - can this come up online because i'll
151:36 - look much better
151:39 - okay that's
151:41 - um so yeah basically all we're doing
151:43 - here is we're saying hey are there like
151:46 - punks yes
151:48 - do all of this otherwise don't do it
151:51 - so now we're not gonna get that weird
151:53 - error okay this is all it's doing
151:55 - otherwise it just won't show anything if
151:57 - there's no punks it just won't show any
151:58 - of this
152:00 - any of this being main and punk list
152:04 - okay cool so let's go back to main
152:07 - now we are getting the punk let's
152:10 - uncomment this out
152:13 - and uncomment this out
152:17 - okay
152:21 - okay
152:23 - so we're still getting that error punk
152:25 - list data
152:27 - uh-huh
152:41 - okay so let's just read it out let's
152:44 - just like console log it and see what
152:46 - the error is uh
152:48 - what the error is i'll console log
152:51 - here
152:52 - punk list data so we can see what's what
152:55 - the heck is going on i'll just cut this
152:57 - image out for now
153:00 - and let's see if we're getting
153:05 - and we're getting what we're looking for
153:09 - console
153:16 - all right
153:18 - so save
153:20 - refresh
153:25 - all right so i'm going to put a little
153:27 - emoji here so we can actually see where
153:29 - this is coming from
153:33 - also i think it's you know i know it's
153:36 - not as smooth but i think it's also good
153:38 - for you guys to see some live debugging
153:41 - because it is helpful because a lot of
153:43 - the times in reality you're always going
153:44 - to be running into problems it's not
153:46 - going to go as smooth
153:49 - so i am getting the freaking
153:52 - um
153:52 - [Music]
153:55 - i'm getting what i'm looking for
154:02 - image
154:03 - underscore original underscore url
154:07 - yeah image underscore original
154:08 - underscore url i have that right there
154:12 - do we not wait do we not get the
154:15 - selected punk because it seems like
154:18 - that's where the problem is
154:21 - because i just added that and started
154:22 - bugging out again
154:24 - even if you put that it should be fine
154:28 - oops
154:35 - absolutely are you passing both the
154:37 - props and ben carter asks i believe
154:42 - so it should already have a
154:46 - value
154:49 - yeah we're getting uh image original url
154:52 - image original url
154:55 - we're now passing in selected point in
154:56 - domain
155:00 - now we do oh
155:04 - good call
155:05 - these little things
155:07 - okay okay okay okay yes yes good call so
155:09 - in maine what david just said is we were
155:12 - not passing or selected punk
155:14 - now we are
155:16 - okay there we go
155:18 - that's why i was getting like undefined
155:19 - and stuff like that
155:21 - so
155:22 - now that we're passing in our selected
155:24 - punk it should actually
155:28 - what the heck is happening
155:34 - okay there we go
155:36 - now it's like showing up perfect perfect
155:38 - perfect perfect and if i chose like one
155:41 - will it do something cool
155:46 - okay yeah so we're passing our selected
155:48 - punk if i chose like one or something
155:50 - you'll yeah it'll choose this one
155:52 - if i chose two it'll choose the next one
155:55 - okay perfect so
155:57 - selected punk is now being passed
156:01 - and it's doing it
156:02 - okay let's make the rest of this dynamic
156:04 - beautiful starting to make progress
156:06 - again let's make the whole thing dynamic
156:09 - okay so for example where the title is
156:12 - now this needs to be activepunk
156:15 - dot name
156:18 - okay
156:19 - so if i give it uh one you'll see not
156:22 - only did it change the photo but it
156:24 - actually changed the title but we need
156:26 - to make sure that this is dynamic as
156:28 - well
156:29 - that id right there so let's go ahead
156:32 - and uh fix that so we're gonna go here
156:35 - and we're going to say
156:36 - we're going to leave some of that there
156:38 - and we're going to say
156:39 - punk dot token id
156:43 - and we're going to say active punk
156:47 - okay let's go boom
156:49 - this is the right id now
156:51 - perfect
156:55 - okay
156:56 - the owner image container you can
156:59 - actually grab the real owner image
157:02 - as well so what we can do is we could
157:04 - say
157:07 - activepunk.owner.profile underscore
157:09 - image
157:10 - underscore url
157:15 - oh we don't need these squigglies here
157:18 - perfect
157:20 - so now it's pulling my actual um
157:23 - image from right there on openc
157:26 - so this is
157:28 - this image is actually accurate
157:32 - yes
157:33 - it's amazing now the next thing is it
157:35 - needs to pull this address dynamically
157:37 - as well because i've hard coded it
157:40 - so we're going to make it active
157:42 - punk dot owner
157:44 - dot address
157:47 - okay
157:49 - and uh
157:50 - yeah this is this is pretty much it for
157:52 - right now just leave the rest as is
157:55 - and uh
157:57 - boom there you guys go look at that
157:59 - right so now when i freaking select this
158:03 - you can see
158:04 - that all of those are being selected
158:07 - isn't that freaking cool guys
158:11 - right and if you guys want to break down
158:15 - kind of how this is working
158:17 - well a lot of the magic is happening
158:20 - here so when we get that active punk
158:24 - we make that our main punk right we make
158:27 - that our active punk whatever we click
158:29 - on whatever is our selected punk we make
158:32 - that our active punk and once that's our
158:34 - active punk
158:35 - we go ahead and do
158:37 - the rest it just shows that right here
158:44 - and the last thing i think
158:46 - yeah the fire emojis are coming in nice
158:49 - is you know we kind of uh flew past the
158:52 - css portion
158:54 - and
158:55 - you know there there's a bunch of it
158:57 - that we didn't cover it there but i
158:58 - think the main thing that main things i
159:00 - just kind of want to show you guys is
159:02 - selected punk right if i take away its
159:04 - styling here you can see how it looks
159:07 - all kinds of crazy this was the one that
159:09 - was messing everything up so as soon as
159:11 - we added that
159:13 - right we gave it a max width and a max
159:15 - height
159:17 - it makes sure and
159:19 - this is super mobile responsive right so
159:22 - if i make it smaller it becomes smaller
159:24 - if i make it bigger
159:26 - like it is
159:27 - beautiful
159:29 - right so that's
159:30 - that magic is happening from here the
159:32 - selected punk
159:34 - okay
159:35 - then
159:35 - punk details
159:38 - all right if i go here
159:39 - the punk details take care of what's
159:41 - happening here
159:44 - okay so if i add that back in punk
159:46 - details you can see the space between is
159:49 - adding the spaces between this and this
159:53 - right
159:54 - flex direction on it is column

163:56 - stay up and push pull through because
163:58 - like that's what a lot of the coding
164:00 - requires guys like if you're wondering
164:02 - why everybody isn't making six figures
164:04 - and why that's not happening and why
164:06 - people are not getting these jobs
164:07 - because because of this the actual
164:08 - coding part this already gets hard right
164:10 - most people want to bounce
164:13 - so
164:14 - you know i hope that
164:16 - you know even though it was like maybe
164:17 - hard or complicated i at least hope
164:20 - was it something that you guys at least
164:22 - understood somewhat of as we went
164:24 - through it did it at least make sense as

164:27 - my main goal
164:30 - okay amazing
164:33 - amazing
164:36 - wow
164:37 - yeah
164:38 - that's that's honestly the main thing
164:40 - right that i want to get to that you
164:41 - guys are enjoying this making progress
164:44 - and that you guys kind of understand
164:46 - this and yes it was so fast right like
164:48 - think about this we did
164:51 - man this this project should take up
164:52 - normal person like a month to do like if
164:55 - a developer got at a if a developer was
164:57 - hired it would take like
164:59 - weeks or like a month to build this
165:02 - or longer
165:03 - right you you got it you watched this
165:07 - project
165:08 - get built
165:10 - in what
165:11 - um

172:10 - i was like
172:11 - that's embarrassing no no it's all good
172:14 - not embarrassing it's all good
172:16 - thank you you got it yeah
172:19 - okay
172:22 - hey
172:23 - this is monika monica hi monica
172:26 - hi
172:27 - great session thank you so much you're
172:29 - welcome thank you
172:31 - i have some questions about the third i
172:33 - mean 3.0 third web and
172:36 - opens the part i don't understand how
172:38 - they are connected and how is
172:40 - decentralization working there
172:43 - um
172:43 - how was what connected
172:46 - like uh we are using openc
172:48 - third web uh so you are taking
172:51 - those networks and the apis right so
172:53 - what is the other connection between
172:55 - them
172:56 - so in this case right we were using um
173:00 - there's a bunch of web 3.0 stuff we were
173:02 - using right for example we were using
173:03 - meta mask we're using third web we were
173:06 - using open c
173:08 - and without them we would not be able to
173:10 - do this project that's how we actually
173:12 - got our nfts to show up because our nfts
173:15 - these ones here
173:17 - would not show up otherwise because we
173:20 - we built our own nfts
173:22 - within third web okay
173:25 - these nfts also got published on openc
173:28 - we use the openc api
173:31 - to pull all of this data
173:33 - so that's how all of these are connected
173:34 - right we use react.js to build the front
173:36 - end so
173:39 - you know we connected react
173:41 - with
173:42 - third web nfts and then open c to pull
173:45 - the data and get access from api and
173:47 - then we use things like metamask
173:50 - to have our wallets so we could actually
173:52 - mint all this and and pull it if that
173:54 - makes sense
173:58 - so is there like any other websites like
174:00 - opencv where we can take the source
174:03 - um
174:04 - there are but openc's the most popular
174:06 - one
174:08 - the the the thing that a lot that helped
174:10 - us out a lot with this project was third
174:12 - web because that's how we were able to
174:14 - like
174:15 - get the nfts minted and and and publish
174:17 - to open c and then be able to pull it
174:19 - from there but yeah i would say like if
174:20 - you wanted to do something with
174:22 - uh in terms of a marketplace open c is
174:24 - going to be your best choice because the
174:25 - most popular one
174:27 - okay
174:28 - thank you
174:29 - you got it monica thank you for your
174:30 - question
174:32 - um
174:34 - yeah so yeah somebody asked will the
174:36 - boot camp take a noob to six figures it
174:39 - it depends on how hard you work like we
174:42 - just had a thomas who
174:44 - uh went to our boot camp and he just got
174:47 - a six-figure job offer
174:49 - like
174:50 - uh three four days ago at reason one inc
174:53 - and he crushed it but not everybody's
174:55 - gonna get that just because
174:57 - like he was one of the hardest working
174:59 - people and his skill level just
175:00 - skyrocketed so he was like really highly
175:03 - skilled and the people just got so
175:05 - excited that interviewed him he thought
175:07 - he was going to get a junior developer
175:08 - job so he literally thought he was going
175:10 - to get like a
175:11 - 60k offer you know 70k offer he was
175:13 - happy with that because his last job was
175:15 - making 45
175:16 - and then he got a job offer
175:18 - uh the the inter the people who
175:20 - interviewed him were so excited they're
175:22 - like man your skills are so amazing and
175:24 - your projects look so good
175:26 - that they came back to him and said um
175:28 - you know i don't think we will hire you
175:30 - as a junior developer your your skills
175:32 - are higher than that so we'll bring you
175:34 - on as an intermediate software like full
175:36 - stack developer and they offered him
175:38 - ninety five thousand dollars with a five
175:39 - thousand dollar bonus which essentially
175:41 - is a hundred thousand dollar a year job
175:43 - so that's how that worked out
175:46 - uh but not but it doesn't happen for
175:48 - everybody so i just want to say that for
175:50 - most people on average you should expect
175:52 - like a 60 to 70 000
175:54 - like as your first job
175:57 - you know but i'm just saying average
175:59 - because i just want to have everybody's
176:00 - expectation be just super clear
176:04 - and yeah everybody don't listen to the
176:05 - negative nancy i say thank you yeah
176:07 - there's always people crying and
176:10 - whining about stuff but you know the
176:12 - people who become developers they're
176:13 - just like they have no excuses to just
176:15 - keep going and keep working you know
176:16 - like for example this crew right here
176:18 - 109 of you are still freaking live
176:21 - it's 8 14 p.m on a saturday you know
176:24 - some of you are about to lose your
176:25 - relationships
176:27 - uh over coding
176:30 - but you know that's the choice you made
176:33 - oh man
176:36 - you know
176:37 - 11 14
176:38 - rogers has already lost it just now
176:44 - man my wife pissed off yeah i hear you
176:47 - i haven't had dinner oh man i think i
176:50 - kind of want to have sushi with my
176:51 - girlfriend tonight i think that'll be
176:53 - that'll be nice
176:54 - i think that actually be great i'll get
176:56 - to preserve my relationship as well
177:00 - coding is greater than everything david
177:01 - says
177:03 - [Music]
177:06 - it is a lot of fun i'm not gonna lie
177:08 - okay any other questions or feedback or
177:12 - something like that uh before we bounce

181:25 - yo you should do that you can go get
181:28 - take it to that level if you want you
181:30 - can try to take it to the level that
181:31 - would be really dope
181:33 - gerardo okay cool
181:34 - um you were at a react intensive right
181:37 - i am and i also just graduated from the
181:39 - august cohort boot camp as well oh snap

181:49 - i'm with isaac right now too okay
181:51 - beautiful yo isaac let's go
181:54 - okay awesome yeah i think um
181:58 - yeah if you want to take that to to the
182:00 - next level add the buy now functionality
182:02 - to it too that'd be that'd be a huge
182:05 - uh bonus on that
182:07 - cool
182:08 - devol says what would we need to change
182:12 - with
182:13 - what
182:14 - hold on i'm having trouble reading what
182:16 - would we need to change with this
182:18 - project to be able to sell the nfts on
182:20 - the market
182:23 - you can sell it on the market so okay
182:25 - yeah what would you need to change is
182:26 - you need to take it from the test to a
182:28 - real market so if you do that then you
182:30 - can actually like put in a real
182:32 - marketplace and actually list it for a
182:35 - uh price
182:37 - like i could probably go to third web
182:39 - right now
182:40 - and um list it for a price on a real
182:42 - marketplace so yeah
182:46 - all right any other uh questions
182:49 - or things
182:52 - cody i see you cody you i know you're
182:54 - you just joined the new um
182:57 - cohort
182:58 - we're looking out for you it's going to
183:00 - be awesome uh who was going to go
183:01 - somebody was just about to ask i'm sorry
183:03 - i cut you off yeah i had a quick one
183:04 - quasi oh yeah oh what's up joe go for it
183:07 - so if we
183:10 - foreign when you are in an interview and
183:12 - you want like a project pitch right
183:14 - and i'm demonstrating my project yeah
183:17 - what are the key points i should be
183:18 - hitting when i'm trying to explain these
183:19 - things i
183:21 - just uh bombard the recruiter with you
183:25 - know wow
183:26 - what so with the
183:29 - with thomas right what i knew was he was
183:31 - just like
183:33 - he was so excited about his project and
183:35 - he would just keep talking about his
183:37 - project like he was just genuinely
183:38 - excited about it and i think for the
183:41 - people who were interviewing him that
183:43 - caught
183:44 - uh his their their eye and their
183:46 - attention because he was just like and
183:48 - he built it too and he just loved every
183:50 - part of it he's like let me show you
183:52 - this he's like you know i built this
183:54 - scraper here it has this like advanced
183:56 - feature and he has like this thick
183:57 - accent but but like it's still
184:00 - you know he just would talk about it all
184:02 - the time and talk about all the
184:03 - functionality added and what it could do
184:05 - and so
184:06 - i don't think like you need to have a
184:08 - necessarily like a trick but i think
184:11 - that if you're excited about what you
184:12 - built and you did put in a lot of hard
184:14 - work and if you want to talk about it
184:15 - and talk about all the things that you
184:16 - did i think that goes a long way and i
184:18 - think that passion that excitement like
184:20 - rubs off and and people can ex feel it
184:23 - from you from a distance
184:25 - cool thanks you got it
184:27 - uh david says what's the best way to
184:28 - prepare for the boot camp slash cohort
184:30 - so for example the people that are
184:32 - joining like cody who just joined one of
184:34 - our
184:35 - december cohorts
184:36 - um
184:37 - we have pre-course material for you and
184:39 - you can kind of get started on it and
184:41 - that'll give you a jump start um and get
184:44 - you ready for the boot camp okay but i
184:47 - mean honestly this is even like a great
184:50 - thing to prepare you for the boot camp
184:51 - because the boot camp itself we cover
184:53 - everything from scratch so there's
184:55 - nothing like
184:57 - it's not like you come to the boot camp
184:58 - and there's a bunch of stuff that you
184:59 - didn't cover and you're like oh man it's
185:01 - too advanced like no we'll cover
185:02 - everything but even this stuff will help
185:04 - you a lot and then if you join then the
185:06 - pre-course material will help you a lot
185:10 - um
185:15 - yeah if any of you guys are interested
185:18 - uh dm me right now you know and uh what
185:20 - i can do is i can set up a call with you
185:23 - or my team and we can just learn if this

186:44 - so
186:45 - um ben says ben is interested okay maybe
186:48 - i i just i hope i didn't miss anybody
186:50 - else okay
186:53 - cool
186:55 - yeah so yeah we'll just book a call and
186:57 - then we'll go from there okay brock says
186:59 - i am
187:01 - um
187:02 - chris
187:04 - okay
187:06 - uh oscar says full stack developer yeah
187:09 - it's a mixture of front end developer
187:10 - and full stack developer the reason why
187:12 - we're focusing more on front-end
187:13 - developer is because you can do it in
187:14 - half the time
187:16 - full stack developer take you eight
187:17 - months front end developer will take you
187:18 - three months and then you'll have a job
187:20 - in your fourth or fifth month right
187:22 - that's why we want to focus on that a
187:24 - lot more
187:26 - my god you said my name right thank you
187:28 - you got it
187:29 - jamori is interested jamori
187:37 - okay cool
187:43 - yeah
187:44 - so even with the so yeah so what we
187:45 - noticed is
187:47 - front like getting your first job as a
187:49 - front end developer will take you half
187:51 - the time but you'll make essentially the
187:52 - same amount of money you'll make as a
187:54 - full stack developer so then in my mind
187:56 - why would you spend twice the time to
187:58 - make the same amount of money
188:01 - next if you do really want to get a full
188:03 - stack developer job why don't you get a
188:05 - front-end developer job first and then
188:07 - you can get a promotion as a full-stack
188:08 - developer job is much easier to do
188:11 - with all of that said a lot of our
188:13 - front-end developers are still getting a
188:15 - job as a full-stack developer because we
188:17 - are still teaching them front-end skills
188:20 - and full-stack skills so we're teaching
188:21 - them both actually
188:23 - because you're still dealing with
188:24 - firebase you're still dealing with crud
188:26 - functionality and things like that
188:29 - um
188:31 - kodi cb so cody says cp provides a lot
188:33 - of info that a lot of boot camps do not
188:35 - and i have not even started the boot
188:36 - camp just to pre-work
188:38 - cody thank you for sharing that
188:39 - appreciate it cody is going to be in our
188:40 - december cohort so if you guys join
188:42 - you'll be cody's peers
188:45 - oscar asks is there interview prep and
188:47 - resume yes our coding bootcamps have
188:49 - interview prep and resume and we will
188:51 - work with you until you get a job
188:57 - and if for some reason you don't get a
188:59 - job we give a job money back guarantee
189:02 - because we don't want just another
189:03 - student we want a success story so like
189:05 - if you don't get a job
189:07 - and you show up to the calls you do the
189:09 - work we just give your money back okay
189:11 - so even if you spend six months and you
189:12 - just spent all this time and money and
189:15 - education and whatever and you don't get
189:16 - a job just give your money back
189:18 - like we uh it's not going to make a
189:20 - difference to us to have another student
189:21 - but what's going to make us make a
189:23 - difference is stories like
189:25 - you know um earlier when crystal shared
189:28 - that she just got a job at
189:30 - you know slack or dave lueck just shared
189:32 - he got his six-figure job
189:34 - um
189:35 - that's exciting to us you know that's
189:36 - why we do what we do
189:39 - child says please give me more info on
189:40 - the boot camp ciao if you um yeah so
189:43 - we'll reach out to you as well
189:46 - okay
189:49 - uh def sign me up i'll learn while being
189:51 - paid okay fantastic malcolm
189:54 - uh
189:55 - do you also offer one that teaches web
189:57 - three we're going to start teaching some
189:58 - web three
190:00 - um we might start doing that in our boot
190:02 - camps too as of right now they're just
190:03 - fully focused so here's the intersection
190:06 - we're focused on a lot of our students
190:08 - are getting front-end react js developer
190:10 - jobs but in crypto companies because
190:12 - what we're realizing is a lot of crypto
190:14 - companies need front-end developers and
190:16 - so when we have you learn front end and
190:19 - we have you even build some like crypto
190:21 - related projects which we are going to
190:23 - do in our boot camps moving forward it's
190:25 - gonna like put you in this really solid
190:27 - niche where there's a huge demand and
190:29 - not a lot of supply
190:31 - so like you become a front-end developer
190:33 - which is valuable already but then
190:34 - you'll have like ton of like crypto type
190:36 - of projects so you'll actually be able
190:38 - to land jobs in crypto companies
190:42 - awesome
190:46 - great
190:49 - yeah this is amazing fantastic so yeah
190:53 - get scheduled on a call
190:54 - um every we'll discuss all the details
190:57 - with you there right a lot of it depends
190:59 - on like
191:00 - um
191:01 - everybody's gonna have a different
191:02 - payment plan right it's like depends how
191:04 - you're able to pay
191:06 - um and we just need to discuss things
191:08 - with you like what type of thing works
191:10 - for you are you looking for only the
191:12 - interview prep part are you looking for
191:13 - the whole thing so those are things that
191:16 - we talk about too andre just says
191:17 - schedule let's go front and yeah okay
191:19 - beautiful
191:29 - love crypto calcium
191:31 - voyages says voyages just scheduled the
191:33 - call andre just scheduled the call okay
191:35 - great
191:36 - um any questions um

192:10 - and
192:11 - it's a little complicated because we do

192:15 - try to help the community build uh
192:18 - generational wealth or
192:20 - golf in general to be able to
192:22 - escape the
192:24 - having to work for somebody else and not
192:26 - being able to invest in yourself and
192:28 - yeah literally what you're doing is one
192:30 - of the things that we feel passionate
192:32 - about wow because a lot of people can't
192:34 - escape that struggle um and we want to
192:36 - be there to help
192:37 - um
192:38 - we have a really cool website that i
192:40 - posted in the chat earlier yeah um it's

Cleaned transcript:

what is up youtube welcome to day two of the challenge today we're going to be building a crypto punk clone the modern version of it and we're going to be doing this with react js and web 3.0 so if you're ready to have your mind blown you are absolutely in the right place without any further ado smash the like button let's just get right into it so guys today we're going to be building a pretty freaking awesome project and to kind of show you guys a little bit of the project and the demo of it just to highlight some of the features this is the project that you guys are going to be building all right take a look at this you got your main right over here your card which crypto punk is it the design looks super slick you have this amazing search bar at the top right the header looks amazing and then you can actually choose whichever crypto punk you want and guess what guys these crypto punks are actually also published on openc right so they're already on openc and you can see that we're actually pulling them from there you're going to be deploying your own marketplace today you're going to be deploying your own nfts today okay so if you're excited about deploying your own nfts having it on openc and then using your react project to kind of put it all together you are in the right place and if that excites you do let me know because that excites me seeing your guys's hype and seeing your guys's love for all of this stuff that we do here okay i want to make sure that i have my chat open and we can see it okay beautiful so this is the project now with that said we have our slides ready let's rock and roll all right so we're going to be building this and we're also going to be using third web to build this okay third web makes it really easy and simple for us to actually be able to do all of these things today's session is going to be recorded if you guys are ready to build an epic project with react gs and third web you are in the right place hopefully you guys are ready hopefully you guys are excited i want you guys to bring all of your energy in here because today is going to be the most challenging day and i'm going to preface that with a couple of things in just a second but first let's recap what went down on day one we had 16 000 of you watched this on youtube which was absolutely amazing we had over 650 people live you guys watching all at the same time like what developer world do you know where you have 600 people live watching this right like i feel like we're doing better numbers than some of the biggest companies that i know like firebase and all of this stuff and we have all these people live so thank you guys so much really appreciate you and really appreciate your support now before we dive in just want to thank our sponsor for making this possible third web we're going to be using the technology to build the projects and they have allowed this event to happen so i just want to take a second to thank them because that's you know they are what makes this type of event possible and again we're going to be using some of their technology uh to build out this event right that's we're going to be building our own nft yep okay um i know a lot of you guys said you completed the homework it's all good so you can drop it in the chat if you had i know you already have done that so that's totally fine and here's the agenda for today this is day two and we're gonna building an amazing project all right that's what's gonna happen and day three tomorrow we're gonna go over how to land the front end developer job in 90 days okay this is the project that we're going to be building we just kind of went over this and remember to show up for the last day guys because that's going to be one of the most special days and we have an amazing surprise available for you guys if you thought you've gotten value so far wait till the last day and with that said let's get started with today's training so a couple of things that i want to say to preface this okay and i think this is going to be really important we're going to be building a pretty awesome project it's going to be you know mindblowing it's gonna be exciting but here's what's gonna happen a lot of you are beginners maybe and even some of you who are like intermediate you're still maybe not advanced because we're gonna build this entire project in one day i'm gonna have to be going really fast okay and i'm gonna be going a pretty fast speed which means a lot of you are gonna start freaking out a lot of you are gonna be like i can't keep up or i'm not able to make this progress and then what happens is this you guys see right now look around you in the zoom and you see all these other faces around you right you guys see how many people does it say we have right now on zoom how many people does it say right now we have live on zoom or youtube how many people it says we got 600 live total but we have 162 live on zoom right we got 162. watch what happens to that number i promise you this is the day when that number drops the most can you can you guys guess why that number drops the most on this day why does it happen frustration people can't keep up people get scared yes give up saturday discourage it's not easy yes so today is the day where stuff gets hard today is the day where it actually gets challenging because you're actually coding okay so that number keep an eye on it i promise you it's gonna have the steepest drop of all the other days because it's coding related okay so for those of you that stay which of you guys are planning to stay and stick through it and don't lie to me it's fine you can tell me the truth which ones of you are gonna commit to actually staying and seeing it through today you're like i'm not gonna leave until this project is freaking done how many of you are doing that every single one of you that is saying yes me i will i'm gonna hold you accountable to that okay we can download this chat and see exactly which one of you guys are saying so i want to hold you accountable to that um i want to mentally prepare you before we get into it because i want to make sure that you you get through it okay and last thing i want to say right before we get in this is the last thing i promised and then we're going to jump in last thing i want to say is this if it gets challenging which it will just watch it just relax and just watch it you don't need to keep up with me you don't need to code it right alongside me you're probably not going to be able to because i'm going to be going really fast worst case scenario you can watch the replay later okay so you can try your best to keep up with me you can always watch it later what i would say is just like main thing is you watch you you just look at a high level and understand what i'm doing oh he's writing these lines of code and it's doing this type of stuff on his screen cool like i'm getting coding i'm understanding it does that make sense guys then after today is done you can go hard and you can like finish it out later right after it's done break up into your groups team up with somebody and work alongside them and like finish the entire project out stay up late whatever the case may be so that by tomorrow you're done okay then you can go at your own pace the video is going to be recorded you could go slow it down break it up does that make sense guys so just giving you a heads up some of you might not be able to get node installed some of you may not be able to get metamask or or third web figured out some of you will fall off at like you know some lines of code it's okay just be prepared for that you can always do it later all right this is something difficult we're doing we're building a big project right so are all of you with me on that can i get an agreement on that if you're in agreement with me on that then we'll continue and actually get started yes with me agree let's do it okay omar says damn i clicked on the video out of curiosity and now i'm hooked fantastic amazing happy to hear that all right with that said let's just freaking go let's do this thing here we go all right guys so this is the project that we're gonna be building keep in mind we're gonna build this freaking thing from complete scratch okay that's our goal you guys can see the screen right give me a thumbs up if you can see the screen beautiful i'm gonna build this damn thing from scratch so uh first thing we're gonna do is uh let's go to third web all right we gave you guys a link to third web all right so this is the link we want you to use you can even copy paste this exact link this is really important because this is the link that works with clever programmer and that's the link that also gives you access to third web for free so make sure that's the link that you're using okay maybe we can drop it in a chat for everybody as well yeah we did okay and if we want to drop it on youtube as well we could do that i guess okay uh okay cool let's put that on youtube description so this is the one that you're gonna go to now what i'm just going to do is i'm going to just create a new account here on my meta mask so i just clicked on my meta mask and i'll just create a brand new account okay if you have a new account you you don't even need to do this but i'll just do this to keep everything super clean okay so i'm gonna say react.js and um december 11 okay december 11th just to keep it clean for me so i'll hit create okay now you see here i have rinky b test network this is very important that you actually get this right if you don't get this right it's not going to work a lot of you are probably going to be on ethereum mainnet okay here's what you need to do you see this over here where it says show and hide test networks right click that okay uh any of you guys with me so far if you are do let me know that you are doing this on meta mask and stuff okay and then toggle this on where it says uh show test networks once you turn this on show test networks now it will show up and you can actually choose rankinb test network okay so that's the one that you want to choose okay cool amazing now once we're done with that let's hit let's get started okay and hit connect wallet so i'm going to connect my wallet with metamask now for some reason it always brings up coinbase i'm going to deny because i don't want it to connect to my coinbase i just wanted to connect to my metamask and this is the wallet that i wanted to connect to so i'll hit next and i'll hit connect so now it's connected i'll hit continue now it's asking me which network i want to do so i'll say rinkeby okay cool if you're done then all good and then i'll just say create first project on rinkiby okay so that's it for now we're done with that now there was a little warning that came up that said hey you don't have any eath you don't have any ethereum so we're gonna get uh free ethereum today okay who wants some free ethereum hopefully that should excite everybody okay um so we're gonna get some free ethereum but this is a test network okay so what that means is it's fake ethereum that we're getting okay test so we're not moving any real money around so don't worry nothing is none of this is gonna cost you anything guess what guys everything today is going to be free that's going to be nice okay so you don't have to pay for anything okay so go to this link here faucets.chain.link slash rinkaby we'll drop it in zoom chat okay and we'll drop it on youtube as well let's put that link on youtube as well yeah wag me we're gonna make it that's right and uh we're gonna put our account address here all right so let's do that in just a second so create new project name and i'll just say cp punks let's hit create all right now it's going to ask me oh wait i can't create yet oh yeah right right right right right okay i'll hit reject on this for now and here's what we're gonna do we're gonna click our um we're gonna click our meta mask and click this over here and it's gonna allow you to copy it to clipboard okay now that it's copied i'm going to go back to faucets and i'm going to paste my address this is so it can send me free ethereum because i need it choose select 0.1 test eth okay and uncheck this box you just need this one checked hit i'm not a robot and then hit send request okay i'll zoom in so everybody can see clearly free eth yes okay beautiful wow that number hasn't dropped yet we are at 164 people on zoom still interesting how many people do we have on live 319 nice on youtube uh rinky's the network you're selecting if you want to select okay so you can see this transaction has initiated so it's going to take a second but it's going to send 0.1 uh testnet eth to my account it's taking longer than usual so we'll just wait and see what happens david why is it taking so long is it because we're all jumping in it and doing it i mean i guess a thousand people are dripping or drip requests ah clarification expired wow we might have broken it guys unfortunately uh interesting all right let's give it a tr let's give it one more try if this doesn't work i'll have to use maybe a previous account of mine david maybe check out if there's other platforms as well that allow us to get free the reason why we need this is because when you're going to mint your project you're going to need like ethereum in there okay so that's why we need it you're going to need to pay gas fees and things like that um oh some some people got it already maybe this faucet yeah that's it for today thanks for coming everybody all right so if it does not work guys i'm just going to use my existing account and we'll go off of that unfortunately i think that's going to be the best way all right okay so let's uh let's go back to third web all right i will connect it to a different um wall oh causey yours just went through actually i saw some other people saying that even though the faucet said it failed the transaction went oh interesting yeah you're right zero points just double check yeah yeah okay okay so even though it said it failed that's a good point thank you david it actually looks like it it sent me 0.1 eth okay uh who did this work for already who has some eat like raise your hands if you have something use your hands okay we have a couple of people got some somebody 0.3 0.2 okay beautiful yup awesome so cool so we got this working i'm going to call it cp punx and i'll hit create i'll hit next and connect so now my wallet and metamask is connected i'll hit confirm over here david you want to go ahead and mute yourself we can hear your typing it sounds nice though if you had a mechanical keyboard that would sound even nicer okay so while this project is happening all of these take a second to kind of get started but all we're doing right now is we're creating a new project okay and now inside of this project we'll be able to create new modules so i'll show you i just hit add module and uh there's six different options that we have here so you could create your own cryptocurrency right so for example you could call it whatever you want like chris taylor if chris taylor drops his um cryptocurrency you could literally call it chris taylor ct right and it would be competing with uh ethereum and and people would be able to buy it and get it and things like that you could also build your own marketplace which is like if you built your own open c the one thing that we're going to be looking at is nfts okay we're going to build our nft connect collection so click click this and just hit setup module all right and while we're setting this up all we're going to say here is again for me i think i'm just going to call it cp punx and it's asking me for an image and i'll just give it this image here you can give it whatever image you want i just had a couple of images that that i want to go with uh and in terms of these assets if you guys want access to these assets maybe david or amanath you maybe we want to give them the assets that they'll need later okay cool so yeah and for the symbol you know again it doesn't matter but i'll just call it like cp you know cpp for our cp punks um and i'll do 10 royalty but that none of that matters here because it's all free and uh it's on a test network so now it's asking me it's going to take some gas fee so i'll hit confirm and you'll see that with third web they make it so easy for you to actually just launch your own project and then to mint your own nfts it's you can do that all point and click and super fast mine is still creating a project it's all good okay awesome so now it's like hey mint your first nft so i'm gonna actually mint a couple of nfts here all this means is i'm creating my art i'm like putting up some of my art okay so i'm mint the process is called minting so i'm gonna get my first guy and we'll call the first guy let's say um bandana punk okay so it's going to be this guy right here and for price we'll we'll give him a property we'll give him a key price and the value we're going to give it is going to be like eight okay this this in my mind just represents like eight eth okay so hit mint nft this is gonna take a second it's also gonna charge you gas fees so just hit confirm on everything that pops up and again it's gonna take some time to load but once it's done what you're gonna see is you're gonna have uh some a minted you know bandana punk or whatever art you want right you could look up any type of art you could put your own face here if you wanted to and you could have your own type of nft my nfts is still loading so far so good nice okay so i got my first nft minted on here i'm gonna hit mint and um i'll drop another one i want a couple of them so i can actually use them right so let's call her what do i want to call her i feel like calling her cyberpunk will give her a price and for her price we will say and and make it all lower case right don't make it like uh uppercase price or whatever this will matter later on actually i don't think it will but but that's fine just make it all lower case for now and um i think she's gonna be a more expensive one like 13 eth so let's just put 13 here and we'll mint her what's cool about the blockchain is completely immutable right so once you actually put this on you can never edit this you can never ever delete this it's permanently there so for example all the crypto punks that are on there like they're just permanent they're never gonna go away the coding part is going to come up all right but first we just got to do all this setup all right i'm going to put a couple of other ones i'm going to mint a couple of other ones so this one is going to be called um you know the is that a cigar what is that thing called yeah let's just say cigar hat punk all right there we go and for price i don't know 90th for for this one you could add other properties in there as well like for example you could add the property like skin white you could add the property hat color blue you could add the property um cigar true and that might define like if it's more rare you know if this is something that's more rare that people might want to get because if you look at most other crypto punks or like most other nfts they have their own properties right okay anybody on this with me so far anybody doing any of this so far still creating a project go ahead yeah people are saying that the ethereum network is taking a lot to load yeah so okay okay um let's call him captain america punk okay just because i see red white blue and we'll say price let's make him uh 17 eth this one is pretty cool okay and uh we're generally we're just gonna mint two more nfts and then after that we should be good with this okay so whenever you guys get to this part just mint a couple of them and you should be good where am i grabbing the images from i just literally have a folder with six of these images which hopefully maybe a mononauth and david can give you guys um do you guys want me to drop these on slack and you guys can hand them this uh we like a monarch is dropping it oh so you guys have these images yep yep okay cool yeah so i'm literally just pulling them from there okay um all right and i will mint two two more all right there we go mint and we will do pirate king punk and let's go price let's make him 37 eth i mean that is one of the most lit ones right and maybe the crown is a super rare trait and that makes it a little bit more on the expensive side wow we're at 168 people on zoom and 315 we're starting to see some we're starting to see some droppers on youtube because youtube is going to be a more casual right for most people it's more casual platform so we're going to see some droppers but i'm really curious to see some droppers and when that starts actually on zoom because i know it's going to start i i predict it starts usually when you start coding so we'll be well about well we're about to start coding probably in like a minute or two we're very close to it okay and then let's just drop one more okay and um green um tennis hulk i don't know why that comes to my mind punk and uh for price we're just gonna say this is a 18th one okay we'll mint all right and i will accept all the fees okay it's ready to be minted okay so guys look at this we have our very first nft project we have it minted ready to go if you wanted you could actually go and uh tell your family members to buy it or friends so all right so we got all of our punks this is all i wanted for now six starts from zero that's why and um you can see they're all owned by this wallet address which in this case is me okay so i am uh good on this side i'm going to close the slides over here all right and now make this a little bit smaller so you all can see okay and now i'm ready to get my project started okay i'll create a folder if you're on windows you probably have to do mkdir but i'll just md and we'll say react nft challenge okay and i'll just go in that folder nfte challenge you guys don't need to go into any folders if you don't want to or you don't know how to you can just do npx create react app no matter where you are all right and i'm just going to call this the same thing as the folder and we'll just say react nft challenge i'll just hit enter and so now what's happening is i'm getting my react project started okay it's installing my react project and then that essentially means that i'll be able to start coding now okay just getting it completely set up just long load for it to mint okay where do we get the images we're giving you guys links so you guys can download it finally got some eth going to watch for now but it's making sense julia awesome happy to hear that ben carter says why not using next.js just because we wanted it to be a little bit simpler for everybody to follow along initially when we were actually doing this project when we built it we did use next but we switched it over to react just to keep it simple we might give you guys the github url okay but not right now right now i just need all of you guys to focus and try to get it or just focus on watching it yeah ben there you go okay so i got this okay now all i need to do is open up my vs code which i just did right here i'll hit command o you can do control o on windows i'll go to my github folder we'll go to uh right here and this is the folder that you want to open okay this is a folder do not open this folder right there select this one all right this is what it should look like cool click it open now i don't need my command line anymore so just closed out of it and let's go right here okay let's hit app.js i just invited you david okay let's zoom in so you guys can see it maybe a little bit more clearer uh do you guys need me to zoom in more or is this good enough if this is good enough do let me know this is good enough give me a thumbs up or something okay perfect awesome yeah my react app downloaded fast okay awesome so now what i need to do guys is i'm just gonna pretty much remove everything from my app uh js i don't really like all the stuff that's inside of this return here right i don't need that okay but actually before you before you actually do that hold on hold on don't delete that yet just undo just real quick because i want to show you how to actually run your app okay so i'll hit yarn start here you could you could do npm start or you could do yarn start both will work for you okay and um it will open up for you in like a local host something okay so i'll go right here so for you it'll probably be localhost colon 3000 okay don't worry about why it's 3001 for me but it should be 3 000 for you okay it will also tell you here and this will get you to just run a normal react app right this is just the most barebone type of app that you could have now i'm going to remove all of this because i don't need it and we're going to start working on our header so when i say header i'm actually talking about this guy right here does that make sense guys when i say header right that's the header and this file is going to be called header.js actually okay so that's what we're gonna do i will take all of this and delete it okay and i will say header and now what's gonna happen is my app is going to break because it's going to be like i don't know what you're talking about about this header thing and we're going to say that's fine you don't need to know what i'm talking about because i haven't created it yet so i'm going to go into my source and i'm going to create a new folder i'll call it components and then inside of components i'll actually create a new file and it'll be called header.js here i can use a snippet which is rafce and hit tab and it'll autocomplete it if you don't have this snippet you could do command shift x go to your extensions and you could get a react snippets i believe it's called something like that yeah es7 snippets and just get this extension once you have this extension you'll have the same snippets that i have okay so now that i've done this i can just go you know i can do a h2 here and i can say i'm the header okay again if i'm going fast that's just because we want to get all of this covered in one day okay so yeah all right so let's go back to app here now what we need to do is you can just remove this character r here write it again it should ask you for this auto import hit enter and uh now you've imported your header so basically what we have done is we created our header component right and then we took it and we moved it to app.js i love the speed okay nice happy to hear that ah we got our first droppers guys everybody give it up i want to see you clapping for the first few droppers let's give it up yeah i want to see you all give it up guys give it up beautiful we got our first few droppers we're down to 160. okay this is what i'm looking for the more we get into coding the more it happens okay so um it's all good here we go so now i'm the header is popping up there's some weird margins around that i don't like and we don't really need them so i'm going to go to my index.css and in my index css all the way at the top all i want to do is i just want to say star like grab everything and i want to go margin 0 and i want to go padding 0 and now all those like weird margins are gone because we don't need them right so gone the next thing we need to do is uh change the background color right what's the background color on my current app here and what's the background color on my final app this is the final app right so what's the background color here guys that's what the background color we need to have here so let's go to app.css okay and in our app.css we're going to do a couple of things let's make this a lowercase app first of all not uppercase and let's delete everything else besides that so let's just have this here i'm going to go to myapp.js and we're going to wrap this header in a div all right and this div will have a class name of app and we'll end it right there so in app.js you should just have a div that's called app with a header the reason for this is so we can now select this app and and basically style it right so let's go back to our app.css and we're going to start styling this okay so we have text align center but we don't need that so let's remove that all right and i'm going to say background color and we'll give it black perfect coding is what i'm here for this is dope okay beautiful yeah all right the next one so now what i'm going to do is i'm just going to say padding of 20 pixels so everything i want to kind of give it some padding okay and let's just go here let's see yeah so we have imported app.css so that's perfectly fine and then i want to say min height we'll go 100 vh and we'll go max with and we'll go 100 vw just like this okay let's refresh all right so now that i've refreshed you can actually see the background color is black well where did my text go didn't i have text here what happened to it guys why is my text not showing up why is my text hidden it poofed yes the text is black that's why it's hidden right so i need to actually grab this text and make it white so i'll go to my header here and we'll wrap this in a div all right like that i'll wrap this in a div and we'll actually just give it a class name and what's the class name we should give it here guys what will make a lot of sense what should i call this class name here i'll give you a hint it's one of the words in here can you guess we'll call it header okay and now david nice and now we're gonna basically go inside and what we're going to do is we're going to create a new file and we'll call this header.css okay let's go header dot css and in here what i want to say is let's grab our header and what we'll do is we'll give it a color white okay let's go white like this all right okay once we're done giving it that color let's go back yep let's put a dot here because we're actually getting a class and the reason why it's not showing up is because we haven't imported this yet so let's go import header dot css boom there we go okay now we've imported it so now it shows up and there's a couple of other things we want to do to the header as well we want to give it a height because this will be useful um for later once we add all the other things inside of it because we're going to be adding the search bar and things like that let's give it a display of flex okay and this will make sense in a second too once we start actually adding other things to the header okay so for example if i took away this display flex you'll see what i mean okay so i'll add a couple of more things here so right underneath the header um i don't need this i'm the header anymore what i do need though is this cryptopunx logo right there okay that's that's what i need so i'm going to remove this and i will say class name and we'll have it be the logo container and inside of my logo container i'm just going to have an image and this is going to be my punk logo okay and then i'll give it a class name of punk logo as well now this image you might be like hey where is this image coming from causey i'm getting an error so now i'll show you what we need to do so in our source folder we actually need to create a folder and we want to call it assets okay inside of our assets we need to put all of our assets so i'll show you what that means okay so i'm grabbing all of my assets and i'm putting them in here okay i just moved them right now for you guys how you can actually do this is we've given you a google drive link with all of the assets so if you're watching this on youtube or zoom you will have access to all of these assets once you download it and what are these assets these assets are the images that we're going to need for this project for example this ethereum image is an asset you're going to need access to these images right this logo right here you're going to need access to this search icon right here okay all of this all of these are are an asset right and just to highlight a little bit more about the project right as as we go through it it's like think about it how how does like when i click here it changes this how is that happening and that's happening without any refresh or anything how come like when i'm scrolling how can i scroll all the way like this right all of these things are like require you to have a lot of frontend skills you know if you look at this button right over here it has this beautiful gradient how's that gradient there how do you add a gradient how does this have this circular background with that right there how come like all of these have these gaps these nice gaps in between and it gives us this nice spacing okay all of this stuff is super powerful right um and we're gonna walk you through how to do this okay so it goes i don't know the punk logo and what that is well that's not a problem we're simply just actually going to import it alright so what i'm going to do is i'll say import punk logo from and we'll go into our assets go into our header folder and it's actually right here this is the logo that we need it's right there okay so now i'll say crypto punk dash logo dot png okay so there we go now it's showing up okay so while you guys are watching this and even if it seems like it's difficult or you guys are not able to keep up because i know that that's fine that's normal when i'm adding for example this image right here or i'm i'm putting this image right there like does that make sense to you guys how i'm at least like maybe pulling this image and how this this line of code right here is literally what's bringing this image right here does that type of stuff make sense okay great so yeah kind of some people saying kind of some people say yes yes yes absolutely so yeah just totally normal okay so um my main goal is that you kind of at a high level understand what's going on okay awesome yeah one dot can make the difference which is why i think it's a good idea that you watch it later too at some point right and then go through it because i think that'll help uh that'll help you out a lot all right um amazing so we got this uh we got this right here now now we do need to change its size because i think it's still a little bit like a little bit big so i do want it to kind of become uh smaller now so let's go inside of our header and i'm going to just say logo container okay uh or actually i'm just gonna say punk logo and we'll make it its width 200 pixels all right now the reason why i didn't do anything is because we do need to um yeah so we actually have punk logo right there so that's fine let's go back punk logo with 200 pixels okay refresh there we go okay i just had to refresh so we selected this guy right here and we made it a little bit smaller okay next thing that we want to add guys what's the next thing in the header that we need to add so we just got done adding the logo so that's great but what's the next thing that we do need to add just visually yes exactly search bar right search bar is the next thing that we need to add so let's get to work on the search bar real quick so what i'm going to do is this is my header and this over here is my logo container now i'm going to go and start working on another div what's going to be the name of what's gonna be the class name can you guys guess so for example this was called this was a logo one right what's this one gonna be called you have to get the exact name right but if you just get certain parts of it right that's great so yeah search container is great search bar is great i'm just going to call it search bar if you got any of those great job you're you're you did fantastic okay um and then inside of it i'm going to create another div and this div is going to be there to hold this icon okay so what should i name this search icon container okay hopefully you guys are on the right track search icon beautiful okay awesome and then we're gonna give it an image right and for source i'm gonna give it search icon like this okay and then i don't need the alt tag now the search icon i also need to import it because otherwise it's going to give me an error so i have if i go into header i have search right there i'll just copy the relative path and i'll go here and i'll say import search icon from and i'll paste the relative path i'll replace the source with the dot dot and there we go okay search icon and search icon right there if i hit refresh it should work beautiful so now as you can see i have the search icon showing up and the last thing i want to do is i also want to put input in the search bar so we can actually take in some input so let's do input all right and we will give it a class name what's the class name that i should give the input bar what should i give this search input joe diaz asks are you destructuring i'm not doing any destructuring yet by the way i'm not doing any destructuring at all this here is just pulling um it's just using this variable right there okay it this here is literally the same thing as if i had just like copied this and pasted that right there okay it's kind of like that okay even though that's not gonna work but it's kind of like that okay so let's go back um and i'm putting the squigglies all right because i'm basically saying this is javascript that i'm about to write all right so i got my search input and then i'm going to give it a placeholder and we'll give it a placeholder of we'll say collection item or user dot dot dot just like this okay does this look good guys is this looking amazing this is kind of what we were after so now we want to work on and make it look amazing okay so let's go back to our header okay and what we want to do is let's go and make it display flex so first thing we need to do is put it in a row right it was showing up as columns that's not what we want we need it to be a row next up after that we need to actually give it a space between so you saw how it just gave it some spacing i know it's crazy right now but once we add other items it'll space it out evenly after this let's go align items and let's go center okay so this will vertically center this so it's not like up here okay next up we'll take the header and i'm going to give it a margin of 10 pixels okay cool so i basically grabbed these divs right and i gave some margin around so like some margin here here here and stuff like that okay so they moved like a little bit more inward so to speak okay the next thing i kind of want to do now is i want to start um doing stuff to my search bar so it looks nice so let's grab our search bar and let's give it a background color of we're going to go 1 c 1 c 1 e okay so you can start to see that color right there even though it's obviously you know not super super clear but you can you can start to see it we're going to give it a height of 50 pixels i'll give it a flex of 1 and flex of 1 makes it really long okay so you see that it just takes up all of the space because that's what we wanted to do right when i go when i make the screen bigger or smaller take a look at how this bar dynamically keeps moving right this is happening because we have done flex one i also want to enable flex mode on this and what we're going to do is now we want to give it some rounded corners so now this just gave it some nice rounded corners and i'll do align items and we'll go center okay so now is it starting to look a little bit better now guys does this look a little bit better than what we had before still not finished right but hopefully yeah it's looking a little bit better thank god for flexbox fire nice we're one step closer beautiful displayed flexi yes okay um let's get the search icon container and we'll put some margins around it right because you see how it's too close to the boundaries edges we don't like that so we want to actually do something about it so let's grab the container and we'll go margin 10 pixels all right there we go now you can see that there's some margin here and here okay the next thing we need to do is grab the search input and change its styling so first we're gonna do the background color and we're gonna make the background color transparent because we don't want it to have background color it still looks kind of hideous right so this is a this is called border we want to remove its border so let's go ahead and let's add a property called border and let's say none done it's gone now you guys see the you guys see when i select it it's only like this much that's kind of annoying right because when i start typing it'll only type within that so let's give it a width let's give it a width of a hundred percent all right so now when i click it wow it spans all the way across you know this is kind of what we wanted now the blue thing that that it highlights when we click it's called outline so what are we going to do with outline guys to make it go away i'll give you a hint it's just like how we made the border go away yes absolutely nice job anthony good job yes good job angel good job venky say great job perfect i'm gonna make it go away all right so let's go here boom now none of it is there anymore that's what we were looking for color we're going to give the text color we're going to give it off white all right so now when i click look at that it's showing up okay beautiful and uh let's give it a font size of 16. all right there we go now i'm able to write throughout it and it does work exactly how i want it to work does this look better guys does this look a lot better than before if you think it does give me a thumbs up but with that said we're done with the logo and we're done with the search bar guys we've already made a whole bunch of progress so if you've been watching it great job because you're learning okay even if you're not maybe doing it you're just watching trust me you're learning awesome now we need to add these okay so we're going to call these right here all right we're going to decide to call these header header items okay that's what we're gonna call them so let's work on our header items now so let's go back to header.js and we're done with the search bar all right and let's go and do this so i'll say div okay and what's the class name gonna be called guys can you guess class name what are we gonna call it what are we gonna call it header items great job wow we have a sevenyearold on here let's go monkey typist on youtube says i'm seven years old and you teach me a lot hey much love thank you so much for being on here appreciate it awesome so we got that done header items let's go in here and header items has a couple of header items has a couple of things okay it has three p tags one is drops the other is marketplace and then the other one after that is create all right it's these three guys right here so i just added them in this is what they look like all right does anybody have any idea how we can take them from a column and put them in a row let's go back to header css yes display flex great work guys so we're gonna go dot header items right and i'll go display flex okay uh display flex and let's refresh there we go now it's showing up in a row but if you actually notice it's showing up in a row but it's all attached to each other so we actually don't want that so what we're going to do for this and some of you guys are going to actually fall for this trap because some of you guys are gonna actually say okay let me ask you how would you put a space in between all of those okay i'll go to the answer yes so space evenly space between normally that would work but in this case it actually does not work okay so it's a trick question but if you did say space between you you are right normally that would work but in this case isaac great great job but it doesn't work just in this case okay normally that would work so let's give it a color though and i'll show you what does work it's because of the flex 1 that we did on the search bar that's what kind of tripped it up a little bit okay so we're going to do dot header items and we got a little hacky way of doing this we're gonna grab the p tags and in between the p tags we're just gonna add some margins right so let's refresh boom there we go all right so we just grabbed these p tags and we said in between all of them add some margin okay so that was a simple way of doing it gave it some nice spacing i know tricky question we got you guys so with that said we're done with header items guys we're flying through this right before we even realize we're done now the next things that we're going to build are going to be called header actions so these guys right here we're going to call it header actions header actions like this all right so let's work on that boom okay header items we're done with yeah look at that specificity beautiful yeah chris you like that specificity huh nice sarah is giving us a round of applause thank you sarah for the love all right here we go so i'm gonna create a div here and we'll say class name and what's the class name for this guys we're going to be creating the header actions this is going to be called header actions beautiful great job and then inside of it okay we're going to do another class name and i'll give you a hint we need to this logo right here all right this is our theme theme switch logo okay we need to put it in a container all right so we're gonna call this what should we call this the class name for this should be called what theme switch logo container yeah exactly something along those lines so we're going to say theme switch container okay fantastic you're on the right track theo good job even if you said dark mode container good job chris that's pretty much right theme switcher yeah all of those are along the right tracks okay and then here i'm gonna put an image all right and uh we're actually gonna use this image theme switch icon okay and of course we're gonna get this from this import right here so i'm gonna say import theme switch icon from dot dot slash assets header theme switch dot jpeg or png which is coming from right there all right okay so let's see if that worked let's go back here and boom it's there is it looking like how we want it to look though what's the difference between this one and this one this one and this one quickly guys what's the difference everybody if you're in here drop it in the comments below let me know okay drop in the comments below come on all of you guys can do that i want to read it from you guys size is the difference yes what else size and background good job monica what else no radius on the container yes raul good eyesight good job size and border yes rondelle fantastic background circle size good job evie yes background radius and color gerardo good job so yes those are the things not cursor pointer though that's not the difference but yeah those are the differences okay so we need to make it smaller size we need to give it this border radius right so we need to do all of those things so let's get to work on it and the color too so somebody caught that good job on that all right so let's go ahead and style this alright so let's go to header css and here's how we're going to do this right so header items we did it now we need to style our header actions so let's go ahead and let's do header actions and we'll say display flex all right and i'll give it a line item center okay so we just centered it and everything and so that's that's good enough right there okay um and then we're gonna use the same hack for this as well header actions because i need to still add in one more thing so we'll give it a margin of 10 pixels here okay so that basically what that will do is when i add in the button here it'll give spacing in between that button and the moon theme switch icon all right so now we're going to get to work on the theme switch container and in here we're going to start off by doing display flex okay let's give it a background color and this background color is going to be the 1c1c1e that we gave earlier so let's go see all right can you guys see that little um like gray background like the square one are you guys able to see it yeah okay i'm seeing some heads nodding okay good you guys can see it awesome 144 yeah the number is dropping keep an eye on that the deeper we go into this it keeps dropping it's still not as bad though so that's that's pretty good i got to give you guys props a lot of you are like championing through this a good job on that so yeah this that's what we got now how do we make that circular does anybody have any idea yes gerardo you're on the money great work buddy border radius and i'll just give it a 50 pixel border radius here all right so there we go we got that circle now notice right this circle has so much spacing around it yet this circle has no spacing and what i mean is the logo right is there's a lot of distance between here there's no distance between the logo and the circle like they're touching each other how do we fix that yes padding if if i know a few of you guys are going to be here and you're going to be like how the hell does everybody know every answer and i feel like i don't do you feel like that right now is there anybody that feels like that right now like how come everybody knows all these answers um crystal yeah don't let these fools intimidate you they've just spent more time sucking at coding and failing more than you okay that's all that's all that has happened they're not any different than you they're not smarter than you i freaking promise you they've just banged their heads against the wall more than you they've cried more tears than you coding failing and things breaking and and that's all okay so don't take it as a thing of you're dumber than them or whatever that that's not what it is okay just want to put that out there for everybody okay cool so we got the padding that's good now we need to centralize everything so we're going to go justify content and i'm going to center it let's go align items and center it align items vertically centers things justify content horizontally centers things the other thing i want to say is object fit contain this will like contain the image and make it look a lot nicer okay so we'll show you guys that in just a second so we got object fit contain we got the border radius on this thing okay cool and then we want to like make the image smaller here okay so let's go ahead let's grab it let's grab the image so let's go after that specificity that taylor chris likes okay and we'll go height and we'll go 25 pixels and if we go back what is happening here boom there we go right now you see it's giving us exactly what we want right doesn't that look much better than what we had before guys yes looks real good looking beautiful the tears that were shed from postgres okay cool michael connell i want to highlight this comment what a champ he says i got lost in the very very beginning of using visual studio code um if you zoom people want to see it too i guess i could do this you zoom people can you guys see the comment now or no yeah you guys can okay he says i got lost in the very very beginning went back and couldn't figure it out went back again and i think i figured it out now i'm only 10 minutes behind man championing through that is awesome really happy to hear that great job mike props props props to you chill tube yes okay let's keep on rocking and rolling a lot of love is coming for you mike in the zoom chat so if you could see it you would know all right so we're done with the we're done with how this looks now guys all we need is this beautiful juicy button alright so let's add that in real quick so let's go back to our header okay and let me ask you guys this is this button we're gonna add is this gonna go inside of the header or it's gonna go outside of the header quick question not trying to trick you okay so far we've put the logo container inside of the header the search bar inside of the header the search input inside of the header header items inside of the header header actions inside of the header is this gonna go inside or outside okay it's gonna go inside okay just because all of this remember earlier i told you guys it's part of the header if you got it wrong it's all good isaiah says i can understand what you're doing but i can't keep up it's all good bro i'm gonna be i'm telling you guys i'm gonna be going fast and it's gonna get faster than this uh just because i want to cover it all in a you know short enough time span because i don't want you guys to be here for six hours right like you guys don't want to be here for six hours straight cool so um all right so let's uh work on that let's add that in so we'll go right here and we'll say we'll go div right there all right and this divs class name let me ask you guys over here this is the login button okay this is what we're calling the login button so what will the class name be what will the class name be login button exactly any of those works all right and we're just going to add the text that says get in that's it let's go get in now let's take a look at it you guys see this button showing up here it says get in yeah okay so right now it's not a it's just a div with some text in it so we'll make it look like a button and and and do things like a button okay so let's go ahead and do that let's go to our header.css again and we're going to get to styling here and i'm going to say dot login button and we'll grab the background and we'll give it a gradient and it's going to be a gradient from left to right and let's give it a greener cyan here 5 9 f9 b7 and then we're going to give it more of a normal cyan at the end so we'll go 6 6 f e a okay so it's going to go from this like greener to cyan so let's go here let's refresh you guys see that you guys see that little gradient popping in there okay another question so why i'm constantly asking you guys these questions i'm trying to engage your brain even if you're not coding if you just keep answering these questions it'll be like you're pretty much coding and the more pattern recognition i can drill into your freaking heads you're going to become better developers because a lot of this is not intelligence it's pattern recognition so a lot of people are answering this aren't because they're solving this they've seen this time and again and they just like remember what needs to be done so remember last time when we needed because these things were so close we needed to give a distance between them right well guess what we need to do that again here because the get is too close to the edges the corners so how do we make this box bigger and make it so there's like more spacing and so the get in is away from the edges whenever i say it's like pushing away from the edges or making it bigger there's one word it starts with the p it should just be coming to your head so freaking fast beautiful up yeah padding padding padding love okay good you love the reps great so just say padding just type it in it will like neuro transmitters will start firing in your brain you'll start making that connection all right so just let's just go here right we'll say padding and we'll give it a certain padding in this case we'll give it like a yaxis padding so 15 pixels and then a xaxis padding okay meaning vertical and horizontal okay so let's go take a look at it again there we go you guys see that all right now with all this padding added all we need to do is make it circular so like let me ask you this whenever you want to round things off this is another pattern that just always keeps coming up whenever you want to round things round things round things right there it's a b word that should be coming to your mind okay every single time b word the initials are br quickly write that in write that in drill it drill it drill it drill it drill it awesome yup great job so border radius if you've said it right that's what actually gives it what you're looking for so let's go ahead and give it that we'll go border radius and we'll go 50 pixels just like this let's go back boom guys is it just me or that looks nice okay what's the only difference between this get in and this get in okay what's the main difference don't worry about the padding difference or don't worry about like the little distance that they have what's the main difference here font color yes yes yes yes yes text is darker good job so we're going to go color and we'll go black okay and that will do it we got get it get in now and it's darker and guys with that we're done with what we're done with the header yo let's freaking go guys let's freaking go we're done with the header let's go hey angel is getting lit at the house beautiful awesome awesome awesome awesome yeah so we're done with the header we've made a ton of progress right we did this really fast and you know i'm not gonna lie this header looks so freaking beautiful right looks so sexy if this is on your portfolio man the recruiters are gonna be salivating they're going to be drooling they're going to be like man i want a piece of this person this person needs to be working with me beautiful we're done with this super modern looking so far right amazing now let's go on to um sarah says i can't wait i have a full stack interview on tuesday yes put this on your portfolio take it to them and when you land that job let me know you know message me on instagram or whatever um okay amazing so we're done with the header guys now we need to move on to the next thing okay so the next thing in this case is um you know we're not gonna work on this part just yet all right the part we're actually going to work on first is this list of this list right here okay this list we will call this list a punk list okay so it's going to be a punk list that we're going to be working on soon enough now punk list right is the the big thing that contains everything but inside of it there's each thing that's that that's going to be its own component okay so this is a big component right here it's called punk list but each of these cards is going to be its own component each of these cards right here so for example whoops this card right here right this is going to be called a collection card okay this is going to be a component called collection card this right here is going to be called a collection card this right here is going to be called a collection card okay so let me ask you guys this punk list component is made up of what component punk list is essentially one giant component it's made up of a lot of collection cards yes good job you guys are getting it yep cool so we're going to build the collection card first all right once we're done with this card right here then we're gonna build the punk list and punk list essentially is just gonna be looping through and building each of these out okay based on the data that we're getting cool let's get to work all right enough talking so here we go all right so let's make a new component here and we're going to call this component can you guess can you guess what we're gonna call this component yes good job andre nice work nice work it's just going to be called collection card okay and we're going to need access to a couple of things for this in just a second and i'll show you how to be able to get them okay so here's how it's going to work r a f c e hit tab just auto complete this okay and then in this return here's what i'm going to do i'm going to open up parentheses right here and i'll put a div and i'm just gonna give it a class name of can you guess what the class name is gonna be the component name is this and the class name is gonna be collection card that'll just allow it to allow us to style it later okay now the cl now here's what's gonna have right collection card has a couple of things so a collection card is made up of a few different things here okay so this collection card right here when you see it what is one thing that you see name it out yes good job so uh joe diaz said this as well right here we see an image so it's made up of an image so we're definitely gonna see an image tag in here what else is it made up of ah nice somebody said border radius good job isaac so there's gonna be border radius added to the styling of it for sure yes we're definitely gonna add that some people are saying title yes so yes exactly so we have this title over here okay which we might just use as you know um we're just gonna call it whatever we want it's gonna be a random div okay and we're just gonna store it there but you know maybe let's just write title here for for our sake okay or or let's just call it name all right what else are we going to have we're going to have a number right we're going to have the pricing of it okay so we're going to have definitely something that's going to be related to the price which is going to be you know this is true and stuff but if you look at this this is 37 this is 23 so normally it's going to just be the pricing okay so that true is kind of a random one but let's actually go here so this is going to be price okay and then what else is it made up of can you guys see any other images besides this does anybody spot any other images in there good job isaac nice work great work yes so we got our eth image okay so here's another image cool and you guys can probably already start to guess that this image is going to need to be styled a certain way meaning otherwise like it's going to be huge but it's really tiny here so when it's tiny here you can already start to guess that there's going to be some styling going on right this image right here there's gonna be some styling going on here because look the sizes between this and this are different uh there's this border radius here there's some styling going on there so already start to keep these things in mind okay as we go through this cool so let's put an image and for this image here i will let's see what we need to do okay so for the new wallet that i created right can i copy image address and paste it let's see if that works oh cool okay that works let's go to open c and i will take my wallet address and uh let's see if that shows up on openc can i type that in nice so you guys see all the crypto all the nfts that i've made are now showing up on openc and i can actually see what they're showing for so this is public information you know if you guys wanted to go here you could i'll drop the link here for all of you okay i'll drop the link right there so you guys can actually go and see my collection okay uh you guys should favorite some of these whichever one is your favorite favorite it i'd love to see it let's see if somebody's already in here oh man actually i don't think it's gonna show me your guys's favorite it right i don't think it works like that yeah i don't think it works like that never mind i thought it was gonna show me your guys's favorites oh wow we got a one dollar donation thank you so much evan really appreciate it thank you brother much love okay awesome so we got these guys right here that's that's all good okay now let's start so i got that image address right and that's the image we're gonna use at some point okay for now i'm just going to put image right here and this collection card is going to take in a couple of things as props it's going to take in an id it's going to take a name it's going to take in let's say some traits and it's going to take in an image okay we'll go right there and i'll go class name details okay these details will contain some of the details that we're going to pass we're also going to give a name right so remember when we were building it out i showed you guys that there's going to be a name right here right so the class name of this div here is going to be name just like this okay and inside of here it's going to be the name and then next to the name if you guys noticed we have another thing which is the uh the actual id and this id is being you know uh basically they're pulled from here or we're just incrementing it manually ourselves but this id is correlating with each of the punks okay so let's go ahead and make this div this class name of this is going to be id and it's going to have this right here that will actually grab this dot okay i think you can do it with um i don't know the shortcut for it is but you could put a daughter an asterisk i mean either one is fine or you don't even need to put any of that there you could just do it regularly like without it you could just do it like this and like you could remove that that's fine too it'll still look good this dot right here is coming from the fact that we put that dot right there right this hashtag is representing that hashtag right there and this id that we're pulling is representing this id right here okay cool let's go down here now we're going to build out our price container so go class name and i'll go price container and we'll put our images in here so this will be called this will be our ethereum image all right and then the class name here is going to be image like this weak image or eth image either one is fine okay and then we're going to put um our price here okay and i'll show you guys how to get the price kind of dynamically as well okay in just a second but yeah so this is what we have when it comes to the collection card now what we need to do is uh be able to show it okay so here let's let's actually finish this out so let's go traits of zero and uh dot value so i'll show you guys once we pull the data from openc all right we're going to pass it in and we'll have something called traits all right inside of the traits we'll have access to all all of our traits meaning we'll have access to this okay properties is just another word for traits that we're using cool so now this collection card thing that we have let's go ahead and put it on app.js so i'm going to go to app.js here and i'll say collection card and it auto imported for me from there okay and it says weed is not defined and it's just because we have to import it so i'm going to say import weath from assets slash width.png okay beautiful now going back to the collection card we need to give it a couple of props so we have to give it an id and i'll just give it an idea of zero okay we'll give it an idea of zero what else do we need to give it guys so we gave it an id there's four things what else do we need to give it any guesses we gave it an id the next thing is yes name all right so for name i'll just write bandana punk okay let's put it as string what else after name yes good job isaac good job joe good job jehu good job crystal traits so we'll give it traits now traits is going to be the only one that's going to look slightly confusing and we'll have a value of let's say 7 eth okay so it's an array with an object inside of it okay and then the last thing we're going to give it is an image okay so right now the crypto punk image is not showing up so here i'll just go image okay and i'll i'll give it that like crazy link that um that i got earlier for the nft labs one right so i'll just paste that link right there boom there we go so collection card gave it an id gave it a name give it traits give it an image and you can see that it's showing up okay it's not looking the best right here you can actually even see it says bandanna punk right you can see that but it's black right now and then and then you can even see it says um zero just like we wanted it so saying all of the things but is this styled how we want it right it's not probably you would say not even close so now we need to fix this right we need to actually change this so let's go ahead and uh let's style our collection card so now you guys have seen the pattern when we created header that was to add the component but then when we wanted to style it we created header.css we added the functionality of collection uh card now we need to style it so what do what are we going to need to do guys what file do we need to create awesome job samir codes just dropped the donation five dollars thank you so much and he says you're doing awesome thank you for inspiring me to become a web developer beautiful brother happy to hear that that is amazing yes good job collection.css or collectioncard.css exactly we're going to keep the names almost the same here okay so i'll just show you here good job you guys are doing great so let's go collectioncard.css like this okay and in here i'm gonna go collection card and uh we'll go color white okay cool now we do need to import it that's why the styling is not showing up so we're going to go import or not not in app.js i'm sorry let's go back to collection.js here and let's go import right and what am i going to import how am i going to import this what's going to be the line that i write here import what dot slash yes good job collection collectioncard.css okay it's this specific file right here that i'm importing and now do you guys see that that styling is already being applied the text font that i just made white is showing up okay beautiful so let's go background to color on this and we'll give it one a one c one e on this okay so now you should see this grayish background color pop up over here we'll give it a border radius of 20 pixels okay so the border radius will start showing up i mean right now it's like super huge so it's like hard to kind of see what's going on but once we start controlling its size like you see the border radius is showing up right there you guys see that right there we gotta tame this beast let's go overflow hidden on this thing let's give it a width of 300 pixels okay there we go starting to get more and more control now right there we go so like the card is is the widthwise is starting to look good now we have to control its height because the height is still too much okay that starts controlling the height a lot more and now we got to give it margin right 30 pixels okay and another thing we got to do is we got to grab the image and we got to make sure it's 100 there we go okay so now we're starting to see it we got the border radius right we got this action going on the split the eth image is still huge so we're going to need to do something about that let's actually do something about it right away so let's go uh image and we'll go height give it 23. okay and with we'll give it 50 pixels here oh my goodness girardo thank you so much brother wow gerardo just donated 10 thank you gerardo really freaking appreciate it thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you it says good stuff everyone hit the front end mastery boot camp thank you so much for the love gerard i really appreciate it um that's our coding bootcamp that a lot of students go to and we help them become developers in 90 days to 120 days so that's something you're interested in you want to get that result hit us up and let me know okay with that said let's keep rocking and rolling i swear i didn't pay him to pay me to say that he just he did it of his own accord um okay cool so we got the image kind of under control that's what we wanted let's get the pricing to be to look good as well we'll give it some margin left 5 pixels and i'll give it a font weight of 600 okay for naught weight font wait there we go okay so now you can see the seven is showing up a lot more clearly right there right cool now let's uh put the price container that we had let's style that we'll do display flex everything shows up in a row yeah just like this boom and then let's go ahead and i'll go align item center on that thing we will go margin top 10 pixels and then we're gonna go object fit contain so everything just looks super crispy okay beautiful now the details portion let's make that look a little bit better too i'll give it a padding of 20 pixels amazing name so we want to make this part here big right like that's the title part that you guys were talking about so let's go and give it a bigger font size and we'll give it a bigger font weight as well that's going to make it like bold and pop out cool now the id we want to give it a different color okay so let's go a1 a5 b0 on this bad boy so that's such a beautiful color actually go font size 18 pixels so slightly smaller on the font size and then let's also make the font weight slightly less as well okay fantastic so with that said i mean the card you know is looking pretty good the only difference right now is it's too close to the edges so let's go ahead and fix that margin left here okay let's see that looks good to me that looks good to me mmhmm hmm just a little bit closer here okay let's see what's happening so let's go back to our collection card yes price container oh my details my details are off yeah yeah yeah i'm just opening it and kind of closing it right there that's not right i think uh details need to close a bit actually details needs to close that whole thing there we go uh details closes lower than that right yes perfect thank you david i appreciate you yeah yeah i was just about to head there okay appreciate that awesome so yeah because we added the padding to details right if you see it here we added the padding to details so that's what allowed that to happen and again remember the pattern guys remember what we said when things get too close to each other the pattern is most of the times padding so start remembering that with that said i think now this card is looking awesome i mean how does this card look guys you guys like how this card looks i mean look at this thing you guys i if you've been following this so far right we're almost getting to the end of this app wow we're at 145 people on zoom the retention is crazy you guys are on fire already looking snazzy looks great looks good yes amazing you guys are on fire awesome i mean on even on youtube we're almost at 300 people so great that's awesome and by the way if you're watching us on youtube smash that like button turn that thing blue so this video just keeps going out to more and more people helps out a ton okay so the card looks absolutely fantastic and now what we need to do guys is we need to make a bunch of these cards okay it's not just like the few that we have here we want to be able to essentially like loop through it right and then have a bunch of these cards show up so what we're going to do is we're going to make another component and we're going to call that component could you guess actually before we make this other component all right yes some javascript is coming up exactly get ready for it let's actually start pulling the data i think i'm kind of itching to pull the data from open c and start using it so let's go to our app and let's pull some data and we're going to start using some uh some fancy schmancy stuff here too so get ready i wanna get use state and i wanna get use effect and here's where i get it from you state use effect from react and i'll explain why i'm getting this here's where i'm getting this i want to pull all the data from openc i want to pull all of these from open c and i want to store this in in a variable so i have access to all of this like in an array right and so in order to do that with react i need to use use state and also to pull this data and make a api request i need to use use effect okay so that's why i got those two the other thing we're going to do is we're going to do yarn add axios so just install that or you can do npm install axios i'll write that here if you didn't see that because i might have went through too quick so just you yarn add axios or if you're not as cool do npm install axios okay both both ways will work all right i just like yarn more because it's way better um so yeah cool so now that you have axios installed you can do import axios from axios okay just like this perfect and uh now we're getting ready to make an api call you guys excited gonna make an api call it's gonna get real dynamic lots of javascript action going on here yes alicia's palm she's like yes let's go we're gonna be using async away joe absolutely you're right good job all right here we go so we're going to go and create a bucket of punk list data and then we're going to do set punk list data and start it off with an empty array nice and easy okay everything is nice and easy this variable here we're going to store all of our punks right in there okay now we need to do use effect because we're about to make our api call it's gonna not have any dependencies to put that empty bracket there uh and here's what we're gonna do oh this is nice david it's uh auto writing some nice code for me that i bet works okay here's what we're going to do we're going to do get my nfts i'm going to make a function this is going to be an async function all right and we'll do a wait and get the data from axios yeah oh yeah rom that that github autopilot is just too freaking strong now this is where you're gonna get gets uh slightly tricky so follow along with me as i write this out okay so we're going to do https colon slash uh can we drop this link somewhere david so people could get this link i think could be helpful just the base link openc dot io slash assets and then we will do asset contract oh sorry asset contract underscore address equals and this address is basically going to be my third web wallet so i'm going to copy this and i will paste it right there okay and we will do order underscore direction is equal to ascending okay so this should get me all of mine in ascending order okay and then the last thing i want to do here is just do console.log openc data.data.assets all right cool now it will crash for me in just a second i'll i'll avoid the crash okay here we go let's hit inspect said console console.log okay refresh oh wait axios oh i'm not returning this function yes so let's let's call the function actually because i never called it so return get my nfts let's hit refresh so inspect there we go so you can see i get an array huh this array is empty interesting refresh okay i'm probably putting in my test nets dash assets assets question mark asset contract address am i putting in the wrong address i don't think so you're putting in the wait which which link is that this right here i'm grabbing my wall no not that no no it's the uh collection ah yes yes yes okay nice thank you so my bad guys sorry so this is the collection you gotta copy this not the wallet okay this is the collection you gotta get not this copy um double click paste okay there we go now i got access to all six of my little beautiful nfts okay if you actually look through here i'll try to zoom in you'll be able to see you know image thumbnail url you can see things like uh who the owner is and uh you could see traits right traits has a price and you can see value 13 representing 13 eth for example okay so let's go back up so it looks like i'm actually getting access to my data now i just need to store this and thank you right there okay so that that line that i just wrote thanks to copilot i'm basically saying set punchless data to whatever data that i got back okay so i'm just storing that in here cool now that i have all the information about every single punk i can actually start to pass it around let me go to my collection card and why is this showing up here that's interesting no idea i don't know how that got there okay so i'm getting access to all my data now we'll actually create our other component guys so what's this component called the component that contains all the collection cards what are we going to call that component you guys remember whoa chill tube tv wow thank you a 20 donation let's give it up for chill tube tv let's go chilltubetv thanks for the awesome content here's a little something from the chill tube community wow which community is this but thank you chill tube we're excited can you guys look into who chill tube is do we know who it is chill tube it's like a am i looking at the right one youtube chill tube youtube is this it no that logo seems different chill tube tv i'm sorry guys i just have to i feel like i'm close to something chill tube tv i don't know i'll keep looking afterwards sorry let's keep going now but thank you chilltubetv really appreciate it all right so now we're gonna build the what guys that's sorry i got distracted we are going to do our freaking um punk list okay there we go goo gan good job we're gonna create our punk punk list all right so i want to start off it's a component right so where am i going to put this which folder am i going to create this file in and what's the file going to be called can you guys guess it's going to be in the components folder and it's going to be called punklist.js i'm going to rf rfce this bad boy hit tab watch the magic happen okay perfect now here's what i need to do in here i know a couple of things about punk list it's going to get access to the punk list data and i know that well for now we'll just leave this as is like this okay and it's going to return class name what's the class name going to be can you guys guess for the punk list component can you guess the class name yes it's going to be punk list all right now inside of here we're going to map through this okay and we don't need access to the index and for each punk i'm gonna do the following my dog is going crazy my english bulldog i'm going to make a div okay and i'm going to leave it empty for now and inside of this div we're going to do our collection card component so remember we're literally looping through and co and creating the collection card over and over again uh does that make sense or did i lose you guys there because punk list is going to be this big thing and all it's going to do is just going to loop through and build this collection card component then build this collection card component and build this collection card component and each time it's going to get like the specific information it needs to build that collection card component okay so that's what's happening collection card okay selfclosing tag it's gonna have a couple of things that it's gonna take so we're gonna give it a key and it's going to take the punk token id we're going to give it a punk token id for its id as well for name we're going to give it punk dot name for traits okay can you guess the patterns what am i going to write here it's going to be what punk dot what dot traits okay for the image what is it going to be if you can even guess close you're good for image what am i gonna write if you can look at this pattern punk dot something punk dot something pong dot name punk dot traits it's gonna be what yes very yeah good job everybody who says something with punk dot image you're on the right track okay so it's just going to be punk dot image underscore original underscore url and where this is coming from if you're like what the heck i just thought it's going to be image um it's okay you're not supposed you don't have information of this just yet but it's coming from here uh image underscore original underscore url okay so i have to follow that pattern there okay beautiful so we're we're good on this so all that's happening is once we get all of our data from open c we put it in this variable punk list data our pink list component gets to work loops over and for every single punk um inside of the punchless data it builds it using collection cards using the collection card component so let's see it in action let's go to punk uh let's go to app dot blah blah blah and let's go punk list all right and give it punk list data and let's see if it builds it out whoa it worked on the first try baby let's go uh very rare that that happens but i'm really happy that it worked on the first try because there's a lot of coding that we did there yeah so you guys see how that's happening right super freaking cool we took it from the console yeah where's the blowhorn seriously i mean literally every freaking thing except for the blowhorn i'm sorry guys i guess you're just gonna have to live with the with that one that's the best that's the best one we got sounds like nasa in honor of oh man man okay cool yeah seriously okay so now we don't need this hardcoded data right good call whoever said that we don't need that hardcoded data i removed it now a couple of things quick question it's showing up in a column hmm if only there was a way to put it all in a row how do we do that guys yes sir oh and man okay y'all got it good job that's exactly right we're gonna have to flex this thing okay now another question we're gonna need to style right the punk list component i wonder how are we gonna start styling it are we just gonna go in this js file and start styling it right here just boom like right right here in the face is this what we're gonna be doing right now what are we gonna be doing guys yes if you guys got the pattern it's gonna be a css file and it's gonna be in here and it's gonna be called what punk list dot css good job guys you got it nice work man cough needs to just go away here we go so let's get to work boys and girls punk list okay first of all we're gonna make the cursor's pointer now let's go back to punk list the styling is not working styling is not working the cursor is not turning into a pointer causing what's wrong why is this not working what do we need to do why is my cursor not turning into a pointer yes good job we need to import it import punk list dot css okay now i hover over and look at that it turns into a mouse clicky pointer thing beautiful so our styling style file is connected now let's do display flex and let's see if it works oh it didn't work oh it worked whoa guys isn't that nice isn't that pretty freaking sick looks super cool right i know what you're gonna say it's looking a little goofy right now with it's with it going over like that but it looks pretty good other than that um quick question whenever you see things that are overflowing like this and bleeding out of the page bleeding out of the page and overflowing what's the pattern you're thinking about what's the pattern you're thinking about overflowing out of the page yes good job good job okay so we're gonna make overflow scroll up scroll so this is going to make it so like we can actually scroll through it all right so you could do overflow like sometimes overflow hidden can work in this case overflow scroll is gonna work okay because you just put in a scroll box now the whole screen doesn't scroll along with it does that make sense okay cool um let's make it so the scroll bar does not show up so let's see if we can do that let's go web kit scroll bar and we'll go display none nope that bar still is showing up it just gets and got even a little bit uglier interesting we'll see if we can do something about that oh wait why are there so many of those oh son isaac thank you so much brother appreciate it from isaac comes a 10 donation thank you brother hey man you're on here so i'm gonna have you unmute yourself thank you so much bro yes sir yes sir what made you drop it uh hey man everyone's donating to this so i gotta donate too you know donate to the cause you know giving us all this information you got our backs you know i love it you know thank you bro hey donate to the cause i'm cause cause oh you're right man you got it let's go baby i hit the wrong buttons but whatever man it is what it is awesome thank you brother appreciate it all right let's keep going oh i'll remove it uh i'll remove the comet from from the tubes all right let's give it some margin top hey david you want to help out with this ugly looking scroll thing padding all right let's see batting bottom and then we're gonna we're gonna give it a you can mute yourself david because you got lots of background sounds you know what it honestly didn't it look better before i did this plane no it still looked like that okay we'll we'll come back to this okay guys oh maybe i didn't refresh because that's another problem that happens did that work i think it worked hold on yes it worked i just didn't hit refresh hey let's go developers this is the life of a developer i mean guys doesn't that looks like that looks slick right looks beautiful i mean man like oh i i wish when i was learning coding i could see projects like this and put them on my portfolio like it looks so freaking good like you really you guys gotta have this on your portfolio you really really do it just looks too freaking good okay awesome um let's oh oh yeah i'm missing the p p there we go i'll give it some some give it something nice there okay so we got the punk list okay we're done with this now the next thing that that we need to work on right is uh the main guy this guy right here this main main is like a big one right main is all of this stuff right there so we got to work on main but guys if you look at what we've done so far i mean we've completed the header right the crypto punk logo the search bar inside of the header items the action items and then we built a collection card we're done with that then we built a punk list right we're pulling data from openc from the opencs api and retrieving it right here like so much progress so you guys should be very proud of yourself if you're here so far and haven't dropped off and my god it's at 141 like you guys have been here for two hours so huge shout out to all of you and lots of lots and lots of love seriously um and and thank you for being here so so far let's work on the main um guys next era says wow felt like no time yeah uh how did it feel for a lot of you guys do they feel like slow they feel like too fast did i feel we went at the right pace i feel like time flew by yeah let me know how it felt for you guys so when i want to build that main component right what are we going to call it what should we call it what would be a good name too fast good pace felt like time flew by okay that's good felt like a minute nice i'm happy to hear that all right so main okay good job guys we're gonna call it mains let's go main dot js here okay um and in main let's get to work we're going to r at r a f c e this thing hit tab tab save perfect and i want to return the following so there's going to be a bunch of stuff that's going to be going on in here since i don't want to make it too heavy on styling i'll kind of like do a bunch of the styling and and try to explain as i go along but if you look at this here right you got the whole main div this whole thing right here yeah you got this whole thing right there and then inside of it you got the main content okay so this is going to be the content that's inside of it then you have the punk highlight right so this part let's uh let's do it like this this part is going to be the punk highlight and the punk i guess um so to speak container okay we got the punk highlight we also will have punk highlight we'll also have the punk container it's going to contain it all okay we're going to have the very specific selected punk because there's tons of information about this punk right so this punk container can can be like a big one because it needs to contain the name the id the address who the owner is a bunch of stuff like that right and then on the right hand side we'll have a couple of other things right like for example we got we got all of this stuff right here at the owner link to instagram twitter more so there's a bunch of stuff going on in here okay i'll try to go through it but we'll go through this a little bit faster all right so class name for the whole thing is gonna be main all right inside of here we're going to have a class name this is going to contain the main content that's kind of what we want okay in here we'll have a class name of punk highlight and then in here we're gonna have class name of punk container okay inside of punk container we'll have an image okay this image will be the active punk that is selected original url okay like this okay activepunk and then we will also put a class name here because we want to style this later and we'll call this selected punk okay cool so so far so good okay yep we got our punk container right here all right right outside of this we're gonna have our punk uh details all right so so right outside of our entire punk highlight we're going to have punk detail so we're going to go like this and we're going to say class name and we're going to go punk details okay and we'll do some inline styling here as well just so you guys can see how to do it but we're gonna just give it a color text color of white okay inside of the punk details we want to have a class name we're gonna call it title this is gonna be essentially that big huge you know bold right in your face name oh wow nice we just got another donation from f a s chat and he goes april cohort graduate nice thank you so much for the 10 donation and it seems like this person just graduated from our coding boot camp in april so absolutely amazing happy super happy to hear that okay cool class name title right and then inside of here we're going to put our active punk active punk's name okay okay we're gonna put a span tag next to this and we'll give it item number okay and you know while we're doing this let's make it so we can also kind of see what we're doing so it's not just completely like all blind so i'll just go main all right and uh let's import it as well so i'll remove the n and import okay let's uh let's go let's go here and refresh yep let's go back to main so instead of active punk we'll just kind of hard code these names for now so i'll just say bandana bandana punk all right i will grab this guy here as well and uh for this image url we'll just um do our own image right this one right here we'll put it as a string amazing there we go okay so now this main is at least starting to show up right you guys can see the main um it's huge right but it's it's there so let's work on it visually so we can see what we're doing as we go cool so punk details we got the title yeah and then class name item number we're gonna put that little uh dot thing again okay and uh i'll just put a token id so i'll just say three here okay all of this stuff we're going to be changing with dynamic data afterwards okay outside of here let's go ahead and do div class name owner details and guys we're almost coming to an end okay but the last functionality that you want to stick around for this is the honestly the most important one is when you click and you know when you select this that one shows up so that one we're almost getting there okay we're almost there owner details item number yes that's absolutely right so underneath item number we're gonna have owner and inside of our owner we're gonna have owner image container because now we need to start putting owner information and we're gonna have an image for our owner okay and for now we're just gonna put this same image okay just for now owner image container and then outside of this so this is our owner image container yep outside of this we want to put owner details some other owner details so let's go here and we'll go class name owner details okay inside of here i want to go owner name and handle so just to kind of visually show you what we're working on right now is you know owner name and handle and that's where that will go uh owner image will go right there yeah and then we need to put some other details like the owner's wallet address and then we're gonna put these okay and then we're we're done with the all the owner stuff but it's all gonna be under this owner div okay owner name and handle so inside of owner name and handle we're gonna have a div right here and uh this is gonna be the owner address so we'll just put this address right here okay right underneath this will go div and this will have the class name of owner handle i will do at clever programmer okay yeah so this is showing the owner's stuff and all that stuff is starting to show up except you guys know why it's not showing up like we can't read it easily right can you guess why this is happening yep exactly font color so we're going to handle that font color as well once we get to the styling part okay and then we just have one last part that's left and then we're just gonna do that part and um it's a bunch of some of it this code is kind of repeating so i'll do this a little bit faster so right underneath the owner handle right it's just some repeating code right here all right so we got um instagram logo twitter logo and then a more icon right so there's just these three repeating and we just pop that in right there now i got this error instagram logo twitter logo and more icon is not defined but that's just because we need to import these images so we're just going to go ahead and do that now okay these images we have access to from our assets okay our assets folder has access to all of these images owner images right here and we're just pulling them out and we're just popping them in right there okay so now boom right this is showing up great now what we need to do is uh we just need to style all this so when i'm thinking styling for main component what am i going to be doing guys what's the pattern here that you're seeing i need to style so what's my next step without even thinking you should be able to get to this yes absolute somebody said flex no you need to create a file so we're going to create a file it's going to be called main.css okay good job so now in main.css we're going to do a bunch of styling so i'm going to grab main and i'll say max height set it to 50 uh vh okay so let's refresh cool okay so we we just kind of made sure that the height is uh there's a certain max of the height it doesn't go more or less than that okay but now it's not showing up so what do we need to do okay i just added some styling but it didn't do anything whenever that happens what do i need to do good job isaac good job lucero good job aaron good job everybody refresh that's another one good job but in this case walter good job this is going to be import so we're going to import main.css okay so there you go right there's something happening even though it's not looking right yet but there's something happening so that's a good sign now we're going to go main content we're going to go display flex go padding bottom 20 pixels on this we'll go border bottom one pixel solid and make it white like this okay so um now we have this these some of these huge images right but it's they're showing up at the very least and their styling that we're doing is actually doing what it needs to do let's go punk highlight and we're going to make the flex on this thing 0.25 i'm going to make sure it's display flex and we'll center align everything and we will also horizontally align everything okay let's refresh cool so now things are starting to get a little bit more contained they're still weird but they're starting to get a little bit more contained okay now let's go to the punk container and put a border radius on it of 20 pixels we'll do overflow hidden okay so the screen like right now the screen still kind of goes to the side so we'll try to control this too in a second let's enable display flex on this okay and then we'll give a margin right of 20 pixels okay all right um we will need to style selected punk as well soon enough but that's after we add in our punk functionality punk details display flex okay okay all right we'll go flex direction on this thing and i'll go column all right we'll justify content we'll go space between on this and flex will go 0.75 okay all right um let's just double check what is happening and why is this is uh this is looking like this for too long i'll try killing this and yarn starting it again david can you double check this and see um there's something going on with this okay let's just go back here i just want to make sure everything is looking good structurally okay you can have one div off and the whole thing will be thrown off like crazy closing here that closes that closes this closes okay so that's good corner details looks good okay we have the main main contains everything yeah it's uh getting a little bit wild are you in here david oh okay i was just checking if you if you're in here or not um i don't see your cursor anywhere i actually click this following ah okay i can see you now cool okay so while we figure out the styling uh let's go here i'll try to simplify it in a second if we don't fix this bug but i'm just going to check the structure and see if it's sound okay that looks good we have the image that's fine yep yeah that looks good we have the punk details yeah punk owner huh that all looks good it all looks good hmm okay so something magically worked okay so let's see what are the things that actually made that happen because it is kind of all over the place uh david is it a selected punk one that i didn't add oh yeah i didn't add that one yeah you have the class name selected punk yeah that's the one i think we needed to add okay uh you can talk to right david or you're on mute hello nice okay okay um i'm hearing feedback oh no now it's good now it's good okay awesome so uh is it the selected punk one because uh that should be good i just i dropped that in and after that you said oh it's good okay um i'll try to okay so let's i'm gonna kind of get past this guys a little bit so i am cheating here because i just want to make sure that this gets done and then we have the select uh functionality working so even if we have some bugs left we'll try to finish them out before this thing ends but i want to kind of move on because i think styling is an important part but it's not the most important part of the app um we'll get more to the styling let's work on the functionality let's get the selected punk uh working and then we'll fix the styling so maybe david if you want to like uh see if you can fix these here right like the styling move it down and i can explain it at the end do you want to work on that for a little bit okay so you try to kind of work on that and um i'll i'll i'll get the select functionality working okay so what you guys missed here is i you and you guys can screenshot this or go through the video but i just kind of put the finished version of the styling okay so there's a bunch of things here that i added like for example title to give it a title size okay and item number styling for the owner the styling for each div the owner image container because like all of these we're just going to take a ton of time and all of these styling i'm going to make it available for you guys so you guys can kind of go through it at your own pace and you should be fine okay the only one that's bugging me is like the size of this bandana punk like that that should be easy to make it huge so because we have title class name title and then we have title right here and we are clearly giving it this huge size oh class name with the capital n is that what it is yes nailed it okay there's probably some other like typo that i've made it's causing it to do some funny things but um ah there we go so a lot of it is pretty much good to go there's just probably a couple of other things left but this looks good enough for now and now i want to move on to the functionality of when you select it actually puts that one right there okay cool so let's get to it yeah nice we're coming close to the end guys so this is gonna be the finale okay all right so let's work on the selected functionality so here's what we need to do when somebody clicks this i need to recognize that that's been clicked okay so let's go into punk list and in punk list what i'm going to do is i want to add an on click on the on the card all right so let's go here and let's go on click and i want you to do the following for now just console log punk.token id all right so when i click this show me the id of this and so it should show me zero for bandana punk one for cyberpunk two for cigar hat punk let's hit inspect it's at console class name did you mean class name um okay david is there another place we have class name lowercase somewhere because i think that's kind of what it's telling me okay let's look it up all right so i'm gonna click one of these guys click so it says one right when i click this one you guys see how it says two at the bottom right there click another one okay i'll see if i can zoom in on this so you guys can see it better boom click this one three click this one four click this one five click this one so i'm able to actually get the id on click and on my clicks were being detected here's what i'm gonna do now now we're gonna get it make it a little bit fancier so i'm gonna go to my app and i'll create a state variable for which is the selected punk okay so we're gonna do uh selected punk and we're gonna do set selected punk and uh and by default i'm just gonna have it be zero okay this selected punk hook i'm actually gonna pass it i think i should be able to pass it like this too right does that work maybe not yeah or maybe that works set selected punk okay we'll give it a try if it doesn't work then then we'll fix it let's go to punk list and i'm going to pass set selected punk like this and then i'm going to change the selected punk through this i'm going to say set selected punk like that okay and i believe this should okay just to be safe i'll leave this here like this i can always check my theory later i think that should work but yeah let's just leave this like this uh oh wait sorry set selected punk like that all right so now what should happen is when i click uh this variable selected punk should get updated with which is the which with whichever is the currently active selected punk or like the most recent one that i just clicked um how do i switch between files so fast i have a shortcut so for you guys it should be like command p or something i think yep command p yeah command p and if you do command pp it'll switch to the most recent file if you do command p and then like type in so for example you know if you type in the name of the file like it'll take you there right so i'll just do i change that to command d because i think command d is a much better shortcut way better than command p but just just do command p and then if you do command pp it'll take you the most recent file and if you do command p and then just type start type like don't even look and think about it just like whatever file you want to go to may not just type it in hit enter and boom it'll take you there so really fast way to navigate around command pp yeah go to the bathroom that's funny okay cool so i got this so far so that's good so selected punk that's awesome now what we need to do is when i do select the punk i need this image and this whole thing to update yeah so let's go ahead and work on that okay so punk list pass it all right so in maine what i want to do is let's go to main and in maine i want to do the following i want to basically say const active punk set active punk and we'll just say use state and the from punk list data grab the first um punk okay and uh we'll also pass some props so we'll pass it selected punk and we'll pass it punk list data so this will be all of the punks this is the currently selected punk that will pass it all right now it doesn't know use state so we're going to import you state like david is helping us super nicely thank you all right so we're going to import your state and then we'll also need use effect so david if you could also import use effect that'll be really nice and we'll go and we'll do this set activepunk to punk list data and then in here i'm going to say selected punk just like this and for the dependency array here all i need is punk list data and then selected punk okay this means that the page will update if the punk list changes or the selected punch changes because that's what you want right you don't want to hit refresh every single time to see the change you want to see it in real time okay um punk list data yep so it's getting an error on this line it's having problems reading this okay because we're not passing it to main so i'm going to go right here and i need to pass punk list data to main so we'll say punk list data is equal to punk list data just like that oh nice look at that did that work actually oh yes it did work but it's not active yet like it's not um this is not dynamic yet because it's just like pulling dummy data so now we need to actually give it actual data right so what i need to do here is this source here now what we're going to do is we're going to change it and this just turns into activepunk.image.url okay cannot read properties of undefined okay punk list data we're passing it in we're grabbing the xeros guy that's what the active punk then becomes should be good okay main punchless data pass it punchless data mmhmm receive punchless data grab the zeroth element inside of it hmm cannot read properties of undefined well it should be defined okay so let's just um let's comment this out for a second what the heck where'd everything go uh this is when wait you're doing the api call already right yeah so this is when you want to check for if if the api call has gone through already you know the puncture is data length more than zero oh okay okay yeah that's the js okay cool so in here uh that's actually a good catch so what we want to do is we don't even want to call these unless the api call has gone through so the little hack that we can actually do for this is we can actually go punk listdata.length and if that's greater than zero then and only then pass this because yeah right now it's being called without the api call even happening so we're gonna pop that in here close off with parentheses and uh yeah okay and this is going to be in a gss fragment wait what are you doing david doing something yeah perfect thank you so all we did here guys is can this come up online because i'll look much better okay that's um so yeah basically all we're doing here is we're saying hey are there like punks yes do all of this otherwise don't do it so now we're not gonna get that weird error okay this is all it's doing otherwise it just won't show anything if there's no punks it just won't show any of this any of this being main and punk list okay cool so let's go back to main now we are getting the punk let's uncomment this out and uncomment this out okay okay so we're still getting that error punk list data uhhuh okay so let's just read it out let's just like console log it and see what the error is uh what the error is i'll console log here punk list data so we can see what's what the heck is going on i'll just cut this image out for now and let's see if we're getting and we're getting what we're looking for console all right so save refresh all right so i'm going to put a little emoji here so we can actually see where this is coming from also i think it's you know i know it's not as smooth but i think it's also good for you guys to see some live debugging because it is helpful because a lot of the times in reality you're always going to be running into problems it's not going to go as smooth so i am getting the freaking um i'm getting what i'm looking for image underscore original underscore url yeah image underscore original underscore url i have that right there do we not wait do we not get the selected punk because it seems like that's where the problem is because i just added that and started bugging out again even if you put that it should be fine oops absolutely are you passing both the props and ben carter asks i believe so it should already have a value yeah we're getting uh image original url image original url we're now passing in selected point in domain now we do oh good call these little things okay okay okay okay yes yes good call so in maine what david just said is we were not passing or selected punk now we are okay there we go that's why i was getting like undefined and stuff like that so now that we're passing in our selected punk it should actually what the heck is happening okay there we go now it's like showing up perfect perfect perfect perfect and if i chose like one will it do something cool okay yeah so we're passing our selected punk if i chose like one or something you'll yeah it'll choose this one if i chose two it'll choose the next one okay perfect so selected punk is now being passed and it's doing it okay let's make the rest of this dynamic beautiful starting to make progress again let's make the whole thing dynamic okay so for example where the title is now this needs to be activepunk dot name okay so if i give it uh one you'll see not only did it change the photo but it actually changed the title but we need to make sure that this is dynamic as well that id right there so let's go ahead and uh fix that so we're gonna go here and we're going to say we're going to leave some of that there and we're going to say punk dot token id and we're going to say active punk okay let's go boom this is the right id now perfect okay the owner image container you can actually grab the real owner image as well so what we can do is we could say activepunk.owner.profile underscore image underscore url oh we don't need these squigglies here perfect so now it's pulling my actual um image from right there on openc so this is this image is actually accurate yes it's amazing now the next thing is it needs to pull this address dynamically as well because i've hard coded it so we're going to make it active punk dot owner dot address okay and uh yeah this is this is pretty much it for right now just leave the rest as is and uh boom there you guys go look at that right so now when i freaking select this you can see that all of those are being selected isn't that freaking cool guys right and if you guys want to break down kind of how this is working well a lot of the magic is happening here so when we get that active punk we make that our main punk right we make that our active punk whatever we click on whatever is our selected punk we make that our active punk and once that's our active punk we go ahead and do the rest it just shows that right here and the last thing i think yeah the fire emojis are coming in nice is you know we kind of uh flew past the css portion and you know there there's a bunch of it that we didn't cover it there but i think the main thing that main things i just kind of want to show you guys is selected punk right if i take away its styling here you can see how it looks all kinds of crazy this was the one that was messing everything up so as soon as we added that right we gave it a max width and a max height it makes sure and this is super mobile responsive right so if i make it smaller it becomes smaller if i make it bigger like it is beautiful right so that's that magic is happening from here the selected punk okay then punk details all right if i go here the punk details take care of what's happening here okay so if i add that back in punk details you can see the space between is adding the spaces between this and this right flex direction on it is column so you know boom boom all of this is showing up nicely okay title here is where the font size is coming from and is huge that's this guy right there font weight why it has a big weight that's coming from there all right so this is just some of the css that you guys were missing out on that we did not explain okay but that's pretty much the whole app so with that said guys let me know what you thought did you enjoy this did you not enjoy this let me know in the comments show me some love i want to see your guys's energy how was it for you guys you guys enjoy it nice yo guys i mean give it up for yourselves like you were here the whole way through we have 125 people like what the heck that's crazy sheesh yes yes yes andrea says i will take your boot camp fantastic we'd love to have you at the boot camp brother yeah anybody that wants to join us you know isaac is in the boot camp so you'll be uh you know uh working with isaac learning with him yeah guys all of this can you guys believe it all of this you built this you watched this with me you saw it all get built through in just what how long in just three hours in just three hours isn't that crazy to be able to do that in three hours uh the cohort for this boot camp starts december 21st so if you were looking to join it i wouldn't miss out on it because the next one after that starts many many months later um so it's in about one or two weeks so yeah the deadline for that is fast approaching and if you guys do want to join it we do have financing options and things like that but that's not what i'm here to talk about i'm here to talk about this project you guys enjoying this you guys loving this i love you guys energy boze has like loved it we should make our own nft matthew's dropping some fire yay impeccable look at this it's crazy it's crazy crazy crazy we have lots of financing options if you guys are wondering how much it costs we can speak with you about it and let you guys know uh but you know we have really good financing options where it could start for a couple of hundred bucks a month for people okay so just you're aware amazing i'm glad you guys enjoyed it i'm glad you guys love this but yeah there you go the whole freaking thing in under three hours okay what i want you guys to do i mean i i know a lot of you guys are tired who who here is a little bit tired raise your hands if you're a little bit tired damn chris is like no not me damn who here is like pumped up and got energy ready to go who's got that energy raise your hands i want to see it yeah chris i see you i see you wow amazing maybe let's unmute most of the people or if you guys want to unmute yourselves uh you're welcome to just know weird noises please uh we'll let you you guys can unmute yourselves and just like kind of jump in and have some energy jumping in there wow yeah oh like crazy let's do this nice yes okay beautiful i was saying i was not tired because i still have to code yes good yeah i mean yeah is anybody gonna be up later tonight coding and finishing this up and building this any of you guys raise your hands if you are you guys like i mean but i'm telling you seriously you guys are going to be the champs like for those of you guys can stay up and push pull through because like that's what a lot of the coding requires guys like if you're wondering why everybody isn't making six figures and why that's not happening and why people are not getting these jobs because because of this the actual coding part this already gets hard right most people want to bounce so you know i hope that you know even though it was like maybe hard or complicated i at least hope was it something that you guys at least understood somewhat of as we went through it did it at least make sense as we were going through it because that's my main goal okay amazing amazing wow yeah that's that's honestly the main thing right that i want to get to that you guys are enjoying this making progress and that you guys kind of understand this and yes it was so fast right like think about this we did man this this project should take up normal person like a month to do like if a developer got at a if a developer was hired it would take like weeks or like a month to build this or longer right you you got it you watched this project get built in what um three hours right not even three hours because we started at like 5 10 and we talked a whole bunch and we talked about a bunch of random stuff and so you know um there's like slides and stuff like that so basically you guys got you guys got watched it in two two and a half hours right so big freaking difference let's end mute all at once yeah so again guys we have a special surprise for you guys come tomorrow if you're interested in the boot camp come tomorrow if you want to get even more value you thought this was amazing we have even more amazing stuff for you guys not the end this is the start come tomorrow we'll let you guys know about every single thing

moderation please perfect yep yep who's uh so yeah who's asking the question right now i'll stop sharing the screen because my question to you is why are you using css files or not style components just for fun okay yeah who was that by the way david david leak hey nice yeah graduated graduated baby you went to our boot camp and uh tell us about the job that you landed um six figures let's go i had well i actually had two offers on the line yeah i took the best one um from my last step to this one i increased my pay by 40 and just that learning one item out of that boot camp paid for the class by itself yeah you were what like two weeks into the you were like two or three weeks into the boot camp and he got a six figure job offer that was that was nuts that doesn't happen for everybody by the way i just want to say that but like that was awesome uh dave thanks so much and i'll take on more questions from other people okay thank you buddy appreciate it um any other oh so dave to answer your question kind of seriously we chose see a regular css instead of styled components because we're aware a lot of people are beginners and we don't want to confuse people um and you know sometimes adding in a lot of other stuff starts confusing people so one wanted to keep it as simple as possible especially since we knew there was going to be nfts involved and all kinds of other stuff oh ally i just see you right now nice hi hey what's up hey what's up um talking about how your experience has been so far i mean you've been here for three hours today yes and i'm also in your guys boot camp and i know it sounds super cheesy but you guys totally changed my life just with the community with you know kevin's here isaiah's here i recognize uh isaac yes you know from from i believe the august cohort yes it's amazing it's so much fun there's an abundance of help the community is fantastic i mean lance my instructor he's such an amazing teacher um i i'm just a million out of ten that's all i can really say and thank you you guys for sure you got it wow thank you so much i appreciate it thank you ali for sharing all of that yeah it's just such an amazing community that we've created whether it's in the boot camp or whether it's on youtube or on zoom here that we did the challenge it's just a phenomenal community you know like i said yesterday just look around you how many other communities of developers do you know that's like up until i mean it's a saturday and most of you guys are up until 8 or 11 p.m right depending where you're living it's 8 or 11 p.m right now um and you're crushing it you're here to learn and you know what i mean like this is crazy uh yeah so i'm absolutely amazing community uh any other questions feedback anything like that you guys want to ask i see you sarah you have your hands raised so i'm going to ask um go ahead sarah oh that was by accident sorry oh no problem okay all good i i actually wanted to ask yeah who's there just one second uh what's your name my name is pablo oh i see you i see you i don't know what i'm showing but i don't know if my camera is on but yes yes um how are people donating i don't see any button here it's from youtube so people who are watching the live stream on youtube oh youtube's still going on what's up youtube so um everybody that's watching it on youtube um was uh some of the people were donating from youtube oh okay sorry i was completely lost i was like looking for the button here and i was like that's embarrassing no no it's all good not embarrassing it's all good thank you you got it yeah okay hey this is monika monica hi monica hi great session thank you so much you're welcome thank you i have some questions about the third i mean 3.0 third web and opens the part i don't understand how they are connected and how is decentralization working there um how was what connected like uh we are using openc third web uh so you are taking those networks and the apis right so what is the other connection between them so in this case right we were using um there's a bunch of web 3.0 stuff we were using right for example we were using meta mask we're using third web we were using open c and without them we would not be able to do this project that's how we actually got our nfts to show up because our nfts these ones here would not show up otherwise because we we built our own nfts within third web okay these nfts also got published on openc we use the openc api to pull all of this data so that's how all of these are connected right we use react.js to build the front end so you know we connected react with third web nfts and then open c to pull the data and get access from api and then we use things like metamask to have our wallets so we could actually mint all this and and pull it if that makes sense so is there like any other websites like opencv where we can take the source um there are but openc's the most popular one the the the thing that a lot that helped us out a lot with this project was third web because that's how we were able to like get the nfts minted and and and publish to open c and then be able to pull it from there but yeah i would say like if you wanted to do something with uh in terms of a marketplace open c is going to be your best choice because the most popular one okay thank you you got it monica thank you for your question um yeah so yeah somebody asked will the boot camp take a noob to six figures it it depends on how hard you work like we just had a thomas who uh went to our boot camp and he just got a sixfigure job offer like uh three four days ago at reason one inc and he crushed it but not everybody's gonna get that just because like he was one of the hardest working people and his skill level just skyrocketed so he was like really highly skilled and the people just got so excited that interviewed him he thought he was going to get a junior developer job so he literally thought he was going to get like a 60k offer you know 70k offer he was happy with that because his last job was making 45 and then he got a job offer uh the the inter the people who interviewed him were so excited they're like man your skills are so amazing and your projects look so good that they came back to him and said um you know i don't think we will hire you as a junior developer your your skills are higher than that so we'll bring you on as an intermediate software like full stack developer and they offered him ninety five thousand dollars with a five thousand dollar bonus which essentially is a hundred thousand dollar a year job so that's how that worked out uh but not but it doesn't happen for everybody so i just want to say that for most people on average you should expect like a 60 to 70 000 like as your first job you know but i'm just saying average because i just want to have everybody's expectation be just super clear and yeah everybody don't listen to the negative nancy i say thank you yeah there's always people crying and whining about stuff but you know the people who become developers they're just like they have no excuses to just keep going and keep working you know like for example this crew right here 109 of you are still freaking live it's 8 14 p.m on a saturday you know some of you are about to lose your relationships uh over coding but you know that's the choice you made oh man you know 11 14 rogers has already lost it just now man my wife pissed off yeah i hear you i haven't had dinner oh man i think i kind of want to have sushi with my girlfriend tonight i think that'll be that'll be nice i think that actually be great i'll get to preserve my relationship as well coding is greater than everything david says it is a lot of fun i'm not gonna lie okay any other questions or feedback or something like that uh before we bounce okay crystal i see your hands are up i'm gonna ask you to unmute yourself if you want to say something now's the time hi okay so first of all um i first joined your you know youtube um programming stuff like a couple months ago and uh my first project ever ever remember i don't know if you remember me but i was always saying that i'm a beginner and my biggest accomplishment i'm sorry my nephew's in the background my biggest accomplishment was actually finishing the uber up and it actually worked and i'm like what i'm a complete vegan and i did this and guess what quasi yeah i wanted to this is more like a thank you and i wanted to say this to you thank you so much because i just landed my software in an inter as my software engineering internship with slack switch slack are you serious i just wanted to say thank you so so much because i would have never done this without you you are amazing guys he is amazing um i've been rejected so many times and then because of that one project one project it might get up we spoke about it the interview was impressed i learned so much about it with tailwind and reaction it was just awesome so thank you thank you thank you wow that makes me so happy that is nuts that is crazy with slack oh my god i'm so excited um do you want to share how much you're getting paid or you want to share that like off this yeah that's fine i'm i don't mind so i'm still in college guys so i'm a sophomore computer engineering major wow and um my internship for values 44 dollars and a couple cents per oval you're getting you're gonna get paid 45 bucks an hour yeah yo what is that somebody do the freaking quick maths that's like um probably 7 000. that's a that's a 7 000 a month rate and it's at a yeah it's almost a 90 000 a year rate oh my god that's crazy yeah thank you thank you that's hella exciting i'm so excited crystal wow i'm so happy for you thank you for sharing that jeez wow uh fulltime parttime so because i'm still in college it's parttime because you know yeah but um if all goes well i will be able you know to get returning offer so hopefully after college and i'll be able to join them for fulltime why do you need to go to college anymore oh my god i mean once you get slack it's like you know once you go slack you never go back that's what they say like it's a saying you know what i mean thank you guys i see all the congratulations coming in thank you guys i really appreciate it thank you so much i'm from jamaica where one person is swear i'm from but i live in america now wow that's amazing i'm really happy for you crystal thank you for sharing that um okay any other feedbacks questions questions i have a question oh yeah who's that gerardo gerardo nice were you the one who just donated on youtube yeah yo thank you brother appreciate it i can't see you can we pin gerardo please so i can see him hi mic is actually off right now oh you mean your camera is off right now i mean my camera sorry yeah okay um all right go for it gerardo i just have a question about the the project that we're making right now are we to make it so that whenever somebody clicks on it they can purchase it through the website or it's going to send them to openc to purchase yo you should do that you can go get take it to that level if you want you can try to take it to the level that would be really dope gerardo okay cool um you were at a react intensive right i am and i also just graduated from the august cohort boot camp as well oh snap son nice okay great i'm super happy to hear that you just finished the capstone project right yeah we did i'm with isaac right now too okay beautiful yo isaac let's go okay awesome yeah i think um yeah if you want to take that to to the next level add the buy now functionality to it too that'd be that'd be a huge uh bonus on that cool devol says what would we need to change with what hold on i'm having trouble reading what would we need to change with this project to be able to sell the nfts on the market you can sell it on the market so okay yeah what would you need to change is you need to take it from the test to a real market so if you do that then you can actually like put in a real marketplace and actually list it for a uh price like i could probably go to third web right now and um list it for a price on a real marketplace so yeah all right any other uh questions or things cody i see you cody you i know you're you just joined the new um cohort we're looking out for you it's going to be awesome uh who was going to go somebody was just about to ask i'm sorry i cut you off yeah i had a quick one quasi oh yeah oh what's up joe go for it so if we foreign when you are in an interview and you want like a project pitch right and i'm demonstrating my project yeah what are the key points i should be hitting when i'm trying to explain these things i just uh bombard the recruiter with you know wow what so with the with thomas right what i knew was he was just like he was so excited about his project and he would just keep talking about his project like he was just genuinely excited about it and i think for the people who were interviewing him that caught uh his their their eye and their attention because he was just like and he built it too and he just loved every part of it he's like let me show you this he's like you know i built this scraper here it has this like advanced feature and he has like this thick accent but but like it's still you know he just would talk about it all the time and talk about all the functionality added and what it could do and so i don't think like you need to have a necessarily like a trick but i think that if you're excited about what you built and you did put in a lot of hard work and if you want to talk about it and talk about all the things that you did i think that goes a long way and i think that passion that excitement like rubs off and and people can ex feel it from you from a distance cool thanks you got it uh david says what's the best way to prepare for the boot camp slash cohort so for example the people that are joining like cody who just joined one of our december cohorts um we have precourse material for you and you can kind of get started on it and that'll give you a jump start um and get you ready for the boot camp okay but i mean honestly this is even like a great thing to prepare you for the boot camp because the boot camp itself we cover everything from scratch so there's nothing like it's not like you come to the boot camp and there's a bunch of stuff that you didn't cover and you're like oh man it's too advanced like no we'll cover everything but even this stuff will help you a lot and then if you join then the precourse material will help you a lot um yeah if any of you guys are interested uh dm me right now you know and uh what i can do is i can set up a call with you or my team and we can just learn if this is something you're interested in if you want to do the boot camp if it might be a good fit for you if it it's not then we'll just tell you okay uh you can dm me right here on zoom so you can just message me on zoom like dm me right on zoom just hit that blue button uh it allows you to pick me quasi um and you can dm me and that way i'll know so andre and dra um okay my team will reach out to you right now uh voyages message okay my team will reach out to you right now message from chill tube angel i still need to know what chill tube is i still don't know what that is malcolm says malcolm would love to join the cohort just message right now jacob okay oscar i want to talk about the boot camp i'm in la awesome if you're in la i i might even be able to meet you in person that's cool okay so for everybody that reached out my team will reach out to right now either david or amanath and we'll send you a link and you can just get on a quick call with us we'll send you a link and you can book a book a meeting okay yeah i'll be a calendly link so um ben says ben is interested okay maybe i i just i hope i didn't miss anybody else okay cool yeah so yeah we'll just book a call and then we'll go from there okay brock says i am um chris okay uh oscar says full stack developer yeah it's a mixture of front end developer and full stack developer the reason why we're focusing more on frontend developer is because you can do it in half the time full stack developer take you eight months front end developer will take you three months and then you'll have a job in your fourth or fifth month right that's why we want to focus on that a lot more my god you said my name right thank you you got it jamori is interested jamori okay cool yeah so even with the so yeah so what we noticed is front like getting your first job as a front end developer will take you half the time but you'll make essentially the same amount of money you'll make as a full stack developer so then in my mind why would you spend twice the time to make the same amount of money next if you do really want to get a full stack developer job why don't you get a frontend developer job first and then you can get a promotion as a fullstack developer job is much easier to do with all of that said a lot of our frontend developers are still getting a job as a fullstack developer because we are still teaching them frontend skills and fullstack skills so we're teaching them both actually because you're still dealing with firebase you're still dealing with crud functionality and things like that um kodi cb so cody says cp provides a lot of info that a lot of boot camps do not and i have not even started the boot camp just to prework cody thank you for sharing that appreciate it cody is going to be in our december cohort so if you guys join you'll be cody's peers oscar asks is there interview prep and resume yes our coding bootcamps have interview prep and resume and we will work with you until you get a job and if for some reason you don't get a job we give a job money back guarantee because we don't want just another student we want a success story so like if you don't get a job and you show up to the calls you do the work we just give your money back okay so even if you spend six months and you just spent all this time and money and education and whatever and you don't get a job just give your money back like we uh it's not going to make a difference to us to have another student but what's going to make us make a difference is stories like you know um earlier when crystal shared that she just got a job at you know slack or dave lueck just shared he got his sixfigure job um that's exciting to us you know that's why we do what we do child says please give me more info on the boot camp ciao if you um yeah so we'll reach out to you as well okay uh def sign me up i'll learn while being paid okay fantastic malcolm uh do you also offer one that teaches web three we're going to start teaching some web three um we might start doing that in our boot camps too as of right now they're just fully focused so here's the intersection we're focused on a lot of our students are getting frontend react js developer jobs but in crypto companies because what we're realizing is a lot of crypto companies need frontend developers and so when we have you learn front end and we have you even build some like crypto related projects which we are going to do in our boot camps moving forward it's gonna like put you in this really solid niche where there's a huge demand and not a lot of supply so like you become a frontend developer which is valuable already but then you'll have like ton of like crypto type of projects so you'll actually be able to land jobs in crypto companies awesome great yeah this is amazing fantastic so yeah get scheduled on a call um every we'll discuss all the details with you there right a lot of it depends on like um everybody's gonna have a different payment plan right it's like depends how you're able to pay um and we just need to discuss things with you like what type of thing works for you are you looking for only the interview prep part are you looking for the whole thing so those are things that we talk about too andre just says schedule let's go front and yeah okay beautiful love crypto calcium voyages says voyages just scheduled the call andre just scheduled the call okay great um any questions um anything that you guys want to ask or whatever i see some people's hands raised up angel maybe i'll unmute you if you have a question or feedback or something hey so um i'm angel i'm one of the cofounders at chill tube um i just want to say thank you so much this has been awesome wow and there's a lot of people from multiple communities that we work with here including um one called red bears uh market um but you did ask what we do at chiltoo and it's a little complicated because we do do a lot but the main idea is that we we try to help the community build uh generational wealth or golf in general to be able to escape the having to work for somebody else and not being able to invest in yourself and yeah literally what you're doing is one of the things that we feel passionate about wow because a lot of people can't escape that struggle um and we want to be there to help um we have a really cool website that i posted in the chat earlier yeah um it's a it's actually a 3d website it makes you a little uh gives you a little feel the moneyverse you can actually even see it in vr but it still works perfectly fine on even low end equipment so it's a pretty cool site and you can learn a little bit more about us there and all our links are there clickable links there little link buttons wow
